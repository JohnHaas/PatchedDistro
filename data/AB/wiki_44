The Psychopathology of Everyday Life

Psychopathology of Everyday Life () is a 1901 work by Sigmund Freud, one of his key texts which laid the basis for the theory of psychoanalysis, along with "The Interpretation of Dreams" (1900), "Introduction to Psychoanalysis" (1917), and "The Ego and the Id" (1923). It became one of the scientific classics of the 20th century, and it is very important not only for psychopathology but also for modern linguistics, semantics, and philosophy.
Studying the various deviations from the stereotypes of everyday behavior, strange defects and malfunctions, as well as seemingly random errors, the author concludes that they indicate the underlying pathology of the psyche, the symptoms of psychoneurosis.
This is how Freud introduces his book:
If an average psychologist should be asked to explain how it happens that we often fail to recall a name which we are sure we know, he would probably content himself with the answer that proper names are more apt to be forgotten than any other content of memory. He might give plausible reasons for this “forgetting preference” for proper names, but he would not assume any deep determinant for the process."
Freud believed that various deviations from the stereotypes of everyday conduct - seemingly unintended reservation, forgetting words, random movements and actions - are a manifestation of unconscious thoughts and impulses. Explaining "wrong actions" with the help of psychoanalysis, just as the interpretation of dreams, can be effectively used for diagnosis and therapy.
Considering the numerous cases of such deviations, he concludes that the boundary between the normal and abnormal human psyche is unstable and that we are all a bit neurotic. Such symptoms are able to disrupt eating, sexual relations, regular work, and communication with others.
This is the conclusion Freud makes at the end of the book:
A new English-language translation by Anthea Bell was published in 2003.

Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)

Perfect Symmetry is the third studio album by English rock band Keane, released on 13 October 2008 in the United Kingdom. The album's title was released on 31 July 2008. The band had completely transformed their look and their new album was said to be also very unexpected. According to international Island Records manager, Jon Turner, "the general international feel is of excitement and 'Spiralling' is a favourite track of the US company."
Background.
Musically, "Perfect Symmetry" is a departure from Keane's established piano-pop sound, with the band employing guitars for the first time since their early musical beginnings and a larger reliance on synthesizers than their previous effort "Under the Iron Sea", as well as experimenting with other instruments such as the musical saw, saxophone and string arrangements. Also most notable is the emergence of a 1980s' synth pop-influenced style on most songs such as "Spiralling" and "Again and Again". The album is the result of a more relaxed and creative recording process in comparison to the tense sessions for "Under the Iron Sea". One of the only piano-driven songs on the album is the track of the same name. Jesse Quin joined Keane from this album as a studio and live support member. He became an official member 3 years later.
Cover.
The cover for the album was revealed on 5 September. Tim Rice-Oxley explained that the imagery of the band are photographs of bigger than life-size sculptures of the band members, made by Korean artist Osang Gwon. It was implied that these sculptures will form the basis of the album's image and promotion up to the date of release. If you look closely at the photos, you can see the non-sculpture versions of the band. You can also see some "shiny" parts; those are the sculptures.

Singles.
It was also revealed that the first full single release from the album was "The Lovers Are Losing", which was released on 20 October 2008. The next single was "Perfect Symmetry", released on 29 December 2008.
On 6 October the entire album was made available to stream, along with commentary from the band, on Last.fm. In March 2009, "Better Than This" was released as the fourth single overall.
Themes.
"Spiralling" is a song performed and composed by English band Keane, released on 4 August 2008 at 10:59 (CEST) as the first single of their third album, "Perfect Symmetry". It was released in a similar fashion to that of "Atlantic" as a digital download only single; however, it was available as a free download from Keanemusic.com for the first week of release. On 31 July, the message "When we fall in love, we're just falling in love with ourselves" appeared on the band's website in reference to the track. On 11 August 2008, the song was released as an official digital download on iTunes. The song was said to be inspired by wrestling legend Ric Flair who Tom Chaplin described as a personal hero for his try hard mentality in the ring. His trademark "woo" inspired the song. Frontman Tom Chaplin described the song as "a train of thought about human endeavour, built on an outrageous groove".
"The Lovers Are Losing" is a song performed and composed by English rock band Keane, released on 20 October 2008 as the second single from their third album, "Perfect Symmetry". It was played for first the time on Hit40uk on 24 August 2008.
The album's eleventh song "Love Is The End" was featured on the 18th episode from the sixth season of the series "One Tree Hill".
Perfect Symmetry World Tour.
The Perfect Symmetry World Tour started 29 September 2008 and finished 29 October 2009, with 121 shows over the whole world. 
During the "Perfect Symmetry" album release week, the band did some free shows in the UK. 
On May 2009, Keane played for the Island Records 50 show, with The Tom Tom Club and Ladyhawke. 
In an interview with NME at the 2009 V Festival, Chaplin stated that a mini-album is scheduled to be released in May 2010, and that a new studio album was going to be released by the end of the same year.
On 17 September 2009, in Thunder Bay Ontario, Keane performed a brand new song called, "Sovereign Light Cafe", which will be part of the tracklist of the fourth studio album "Strangeland".
On various dates on the tour, the band recorded several songs, which were later released on the EP "Night Train".

List of IPC world records in swimming

The world records in disability swimming are ratified by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). These are the fastest performances in swimming events at meets sanctioned by the IPC.
Races are held in four swimming strokes: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly over varying distances and in either individual or relay race events. Medley events combine all four strokes, again either as an individual format (swum in order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle) and as a team relay (swim in order: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle). Competitors are allocated a classification based on their ability in the water, with records available for each event in each classification.
This currently used classification system has been in use since the 2000 Sydney Games.
Events in classification 14 are currently suspended by the IPC. The International Sports Federation for People with an Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) records and recognises world record performances in this classification as a separate process from the IPC.
Record lists.
Records are recorded in men's and women's competition in both long course (50 m) and short course (25 m) swimming pools. On each list there are almost 200 records, so they are therefore presented in separate articles:

Corfu Channel incident

The Corfu Channel Incident refers to three separate events involving Royal Navy ships in the Channel of Corfu which took place in 1946, and it is considered an early episode of the Cold War. During the first incident, Royal Navy ships came under fire from Albanian fortifications. The second incident involved Royal Navy ships striking mines and the third incident occurred when the Royal Navy conducted mine-clearing operations in the Corfu Channel, but in Albanian territorial waters, and Albania complained about them to the United Nations.
This series of incidents led to the Corfu Channel Case, where the United Kingdom brought a case against the People's Socialist Republic of Albania to the International Court of Justice. The Court rendered a decision under which Albania was to pay £844,000 to Great Britain, the equivalent of £20 million in 2006. Because of the incidents, Britain, in 1946, broke off talks with Albania aimed at establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. Diplomatic relations were only restored in 1991.
History.
The incidents started on 15 May 1946 when two Royal Navy ships, HMS "Orion" and HMS "Superb", crossed the Corfu Channel following a prior inspection and clearing of the strait. While crossing they came under fire from fortifications situated on the Albanian coast. Although the ships suffered no material damage and no human casualties occurred, Britain issued a formal demand for "an immediate and public apology from the Albanian Government". Such apology was not forthcoming, however, and the Albanian Government claimed that the British ships had trespassed in Albanian territorial waters.
The second incident was by far the more serious. On 22 October 1946, a Royal Navy flotilla composed of the cruisers HMS "Mauritius" and HMS "Leander", and the destroyers and HMS "Volage", was ordered northward through the Corfu Channel with the express orders to test the Albanian reaction to their right of innocent passage. The crews were instructed to respond if attacked.
They were passing close to the Albanian coast in what they considered to be a mine-free zone with "Mauritius" leading and "Saumarez" following closely. "Leander" was about one and two thirds of a nautical mile or three kilometres away accompanied by "Volage". Near the bay of Saranda, just prior to 3 p.m., the destroyer "Saumarez" struck a mine and was heavily damaged. The destroyer "Volage" was ordered to tow the "Saumarez" south to Corfu harbour.
At approximately 4:16 p.m., while towing, "Volage" struck a mine also and sustained heavy damage. Both ships' bows were completely blown off and adverse weather conditions in the straits made the towing effort exceedingly difficult with both ships sailing stern-first, but after twelve hours of effort both ships managed to reach the Corfu harbour. Forty-four men died and forty-two were injured in the incident.
Between thirty-two and forty-three of the dead are estimated to have belonged to the crew of "Saumarez". The "Saumarez" was damaged beyond repair while the damage to "Volage" was repairable. The Albanian coastal batteries did not fire during this incident and an Albanian Navy vessel approached the scene flying the Albanian flag and a white flag. Since Albania had no appropriate vessels at that time, the mines were probably laid by Yugoslavian minelayers "Mljet" and "Meljine" on Albanian request, around 20 October 1946.
The British Minister of Pensions at the time of the incident awarded full military pensions to the disabled and to the widows of the dead.
The third and final incident occurred on 12 November – 13 November 1946 when the Royal Navy carried out an additional mine sweeping operation in the Corfu channel, codenamed "Operation Retail". Under the direction of the "Allied Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean" the mine-sweeping operation took place within Albanian territorial waters, but without authorisation by the Albanian government, and had the additional purpose of using the mines as "corpora delicti" to prove that the British were acting in self defence by attempting to clear hazards to navigation.
There was also present a French naval officer who, at the invitation of the "Mediterranean Zone Board", acted as an observer. An aircraft carrier, HMS Ocean (Captain, later Admiral of the Fleet, Sir Casper John), cruisers and other warships provided cover. Twenty-two contact mines were discovered and cut from their undersea moorings. The placement of the mines was such that the minefield was deemed to have been deliberately designed and not simply a random aggregation of isolated mines. Two of the cut mines were sent to Malta for further examination.
It was then discovered that the mines were of German origin but they were free of rust and marine growth. They were also freshly painted and their mooring cables were recently lubricated. It was concluded that the minefield was laid shortly before the incident involving "Saumarez" and "Volage". Mine fragment analysis from the "Volage" confirmed the mines were similar to the ones at Malta.
Following the third incident, Albania, under prime minister Enver Hoxha, dispatched a telegram to the United Nations complaining about an incursion by the Royal Navy into Albanian coastal waters.
Aftermath.
On 9 December 1946 Britain sent a note to the Albanian government accusing Albania of laying the mines and demanding reparations for the May and October incidents. Britain demanded a reply within fourteen days, mentioning that in the event of a negative Albanian response the matter would be referred to the UN Security Council. The Albanian government in its reply, which was received by the British on 21 December 1946, denied the British allegations and went on to elaborate that the whole affair was the work of countries which did not wish to see a normalisation of relations between Albania and Britain, and in fact vessels from Greece and other countries had trespassed recently in the area where the mines were discovered.
The British government did not find this response satisfactory and it eventually brought its case to the International Court of Justice, having failed in its attempt to involve the Security Council in the matter. It was the first case adjudicated by the ICJ, and in December 1949 the court awarded the British the sum of £843,947 or US $2,009,437 having found that, irrespectively of who laid the mines, the Albanians ought to have observed any such action, since the minefield was so close to their coast, and thus they failed to inform the British of the danger. The Court also rejected the self-defence argument advanced by the United Kingdom and found that the mine-clearing operations undertaken by the British during "Operation Retail", in the absence of prior Albanian consent, were illegal.
The Albanian Government refused to pay the reparations ordered by the Court and in retaliation the British withheld 1574 kilograms of gold belonging to Albania. The gold, looted by the Axis powers from Albania during World War II, was stored in the vaults of the Bank of England and was awarded to the Albanians by the US-UK-France tripartite commission in 1948 after it was retrieved by the Allies.
With the end of the Cold War, the "People’s Socialist Republic of Albania" ceased to exist in 1991. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on 29 May 1991. Soon after, on 8 May 1992, Britain and Albania announced that they had come to an agreement over the Corfu Channel case, jointly announcing that "Both sides expressed their regret at the Corfu Channel Incident of 22 October 1946". Only in 1996 following lengthy negotiations was the gold finally returned to Albania after it agreed to pay US $2,000,000 in delayed reparations.
Enver Hoxha, in his memoirs about his first meeting with Joseph Stalin, wrote that the whole affair was concocted by the British as an excuse for military intervention at the town of Saranda. Hoxha also described the events as "an unprecedented provocation toward our country".
On 2 November 2009 a team of US and Albanian researchers announced that they found what they believe to be the bow segments of HMS "Volage" in the Corfu Channel under approximately fifty metres of water. Dishes, shoes and ammunition found in the area surrounding the wreckage are further evidence that fits, according to the researchers.
In May of 2013, a special edition of Archaeology Magazine entitled "Shipwrecks", specifically, the article "Righting a Cold War Wrong: Where was HMS Volage?" gave insight into the new discoveries. The Director of the Albanian Center for Marine Research, Auron Tare obtained film footage from the The National Archives United Kingdom of the incident showing HMS Volage very close to shore when the incident occurred. This was further reinforced by James P. Delgado, Director of Maritime Heritage for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). He reasserted his claim made previously to Associated Press that the wreck was that of the HMS Volage because the electrical wiring of the bow section discovered was of the time period one would expect. The fact that the bow section, with dishes intact and stacked shows a rapid sinking, and negates the British claim that the ships, including HMS Volage were not in international waters as claimed so many decades ago. (Archaeology Magazine, "Shipwreck", May 2013)
International Law.
The International Court of Justice ruling in the case established a precedent regarding whether a violation of territorial sovereignty is justified intervention. The United Kingdom claimed it was justified in entering Albanian territorial waters on 12 November and 13 November 1946 to secure evidence needed to support its case. The ICJ responded,

Doc &amp; Dawg

Doc & Dawg is the title of a recording by the American folk music artist Doc Watson and mandolinist David Grisman, released in 1997.
History.
Doc Watson and David Grisman first met in the early 1960s when Watson was playing at Gerde's Folk City in New York. Grisman, only 17 years old, was invited on stage by Watson to join him on mandolin for a rendition of “In the Pines”.
Mostly recorded at Grisman's home over a period of years, the recordings are informal and pulled from numerous recording sessions. In the liner notes, Grisman described the sessions: "These tapes document some wonderful 'after-dinner' sessions at my home during several of Doc's visits. Tunes were selected spontaneously and more often than not, played only once. We're pleased to share some of these moments."
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, the music critic S. Colby Miller wrote of the album, "The tracks are mainly traditional country and bluegrass tunes played lovingly and often with great restraint... This is an intimate collaboration between two men at the top of their craft who share a passion for acoustic music. It is a pleasure to listen in."
Stephen Hatfield of "No Depression" wrote, "Beyond the song selection and quality picking, the true source of bliss in this music is the level of familiarity and comfort it exudes. Listening to the music, one can almost imagine the two of them trading licks and guffaws right there on the front porch. Watson’s warm voice and conversational tone only add to the intimacy"

Murray came into the competition as the world bronze medalist in the 54 kg division. Despite of that, his reputations made minimal impact as Gu advanced into the last 16 with a 17-7 win that left the British camp fuming about poor judging.
Afterwards, Murray said making the weight limit had been a problem. His comments came just days after, Frankie Gavin, Britain's world lightweight champion, has been pulled out after officials feared for his health if he carried on trying to beat the scales.
Edwards, Murray's Coach, agreed with his fighter. 'The judges took it away from him. I thought they were very generous to the Chinese. You expect a slight bias but you come to the Olympic Games and expect a level playing field.'
There are five judges for Olympic bouts, none of whom were British or Chinese for Murray's fight. Points are recorded when at least three simultaneously press their buttons to record a hit but the reactions from the crowd can influence them.
'I am not saying Joe would have won but I am saying they forced him to do some things that weren't in his game plan. He didn't box the best I have seen him box but scoring makes a difference to the tactics and those had to be changed because of the scoring. The Ukrainians have already protested about the judging when one of their fighters lost to a Chinese,' said Edwards.
Murray's defeat followed the disappointment of Richard Faulds, the 2000 Olympic champion, who finished only sixth in the double trap.

Beaux Arts Ball

The Beaux Arts Ball (in French the Bal des Quatres Arts) is the annual costume ball traditionally given by the students of the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris in the spring, in the École building on the rue Bonaparte overlooking the Seine. Elaborately allegorical floats circled the room at midnight and were judged by a panel. "It is a riot, a revival of paganism, known elsewhere only in Italy. It is also, in its way, a hymn to beauty, a living explosion of the senses and the emotions," wrote E. Berry Wall in "Neither Pest Nor Puritan." Its reputation for fabulously designed nudity, "louche" antics, cross-dressing and high style encouraged imitators in American cities. In 1931, in New York, famous architects dressed up as their buildings and today, many American architecture schools hold similar costume balls.
Reference to the Beaux-Arts Ball is made in the verse of the popular Rodgers and Hart song "The Lady Is A Tramp" from "Babes in Arms" (1937).

Man Is Wolf to Man

Man Is Wolf to Man (1998; ISBN 9780520221529) from the Latin Homo homini lupus is a memoir by Janusz Bardach, primarily surrounding the years during World War II. It was co-written with Kathleen Gleeson. The book tells the story of Bardach's transformation from placid student in pre-war Poland, to a Communist convert after the Soviet Union's bisecting of the country with Germany, and then follows him through his trial for treason and sentence of forced labor in the camps in the Kolyma region of Siberia. Throughout, Bardach's accounts show the sacrifice, toil, and luck necessary to survive in a Stalinist-era labor camp.
Prologue.
The memoir opens in Poland in July 1941, during Operation Barbarosa, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Bardach, a member of a tank crew, is digging his own grave in anticipation of his execution for treason. During the war, treason was an all-encompassing offense that could be applied to a litany of offenses, ranging from something as small as dereliction of duty. In Bardach's case, he was charged with treason for the belief that he intentionally wrecked his tank, when in fact it was simply rendered inoperable while fording a river.
Bound and thrust into his self-made grave, Bardach waits for the impending shot, all the while wondering how it was that he had come to this place. "The night and earth and sleep and death had merged. All felt the same."
Reviews.
In so far as "Man Is Wolf to Man" is the story of man's brutality to man, popular criticism tended to compare it favorably to similar historical works, most notably Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago", while at the same time pointing toward its ultimately uplifting tale, not only of man's ability to survive, but also to assist others when seemingly at their worst. Perhaps most damning is Bardach's transformation from earnest Communist sympathizer to witness to its greatest atrocities. Paul Goldberg said in the "New York Times", "'Man Is Wolf to Man' presents an eloquent account of Bardach's transition from naivete to wisdom."

Ivan Vasilyev

Ivan Vasilyev was a Russian explorer and navigator of the Imperial Russian Navy. He accompanied Leonty Andrianovich Gagemeister on ship "Neva" to explore the coasts of Alaska and the North Pacific in 1806. 
Vasilyev explored the Alexander Archipelago and the many coastal Islands in the area. In 1809 he surveyed the western shore of Baranof Island and at an unknown date "died in the service."
Navigator Ivan Vasilyev should not be confused with explorer Mikhail Vasilyev, or with another Captain Vasiliev about whom Krusenstern says: "It is much to be regretted that the hydrographic works of a naval officer, Vasilief, who was in the employment of the American Company, were lost... Provided with a sextant and chronometer and with much zeal and attachment for his profession, he had during his sojourn in our American colonies made a complete survey of all of the Aleutian Islands without having had specific instructions to do so. Unfortunately he was drowned in Okhotsk harbor on his return from America to Russia, and what became of his precious papers and drawings is unknown..."
Ivan Vasilyev's name is spelt as "Vasilief" in the United States, where he is also known as "Ivan Vasiliev the first", in order to differentiate him from other Russian mariners and early explorers of Alaska also named "Vasilyev".
Vasilief Bank close to Sitka and Vasilief Rock in Kodiak Island were named after him. There are other geographic features in the coast of Alaska and the Aleutians bearing the name "Vasilief", but it is not clear after which Vasilyev they were named.

Kotel-Elena-Dryanovo dialect

The Kotel-Elena-Dryanovo dialect is a Bulgarian dialect, which is part of the Balkan group of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. Its range includes the eastern parts of the Balkan Mountains, i.e. the regions of Dryanovo, Kotel and Elena). As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, speakers of the dialect have also moved south towards Burgas and north towards Varna and Targovishte. The most significant feature of the dialect, as in all Balkan dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable. The Kotel-Elena-Dryanovo dialect can be divided into three subdialects, i.e. Kotel, Elena and Dryanovo etc. which share many common features and yet have some differences.
Phonological and morphological characteristics.
The Kotel-Elena-Dryanovo dialect is very similar to the Central Balkan dialect and especially to the Gabrovo subdialect. The distinguishing features of the Kotel-Elena-Dryanovo dialect are, as follows:
Most other phonological and morphological characteristics of the Kotel-Elena-Dryanovo dialect are the same as the characteristics of the Central Balkan dialect and the general features typical for all Balkan dialects, cf. respective articles for details.

Miami Monthly

Miami Monthly is Southeast Florida's city/regional magazine, publishing news and information on the people, politics, life, culture and style of the greater Miami area.
History.
Miami Monthly evolved from a family of community publications founded in 1997 by publisher Elena V. Carpenter. Appearing first as tabloid-size newspapers, the Coconut Grove Times, Brickell Post and South Miami Times grew into glossy city magazines that were combined into an expanded city/regional in 2005.
Editorial Content.
Each issue contains community news, people profiles, feature articles, real estate news and advice, fashion, auto reviews, social pages, a cultural and events calendar, restaurant reviews and listings, a wine column, and the Miami Moment photo essay page.
Miami Monthly is noted for its coverage of political issues, its analysis of real estate trends, and timely information of interest to the business community.
In July 2007, Miami Monthly broke the story of an organized group of City of Miami employees who participated in an underground business known as The Firm. "Robbing the City Blind" described how members of the Capital Improvements Department spent many hours each day working on their secret clients using city computers, vehicles and other equipment. A dozen initial arrests included charges ranging from organized racketeering to grand theft and fraud.
In November 2007, "Boom or Bust" exposed an enclave of single-family homes in a neighborhood-in-transition that were selling above listing prices, and promptly going into foreclosure. The feature story also brought to light an over-tasked law enforcement community unable to deal with the mounting cases of mortgage fraud in Miami-Dade County. A follow-up story in July 2008 documented thousands of mortgage-related foreclosures throughout the area.
Miami Monthly publishes three themed issues each year: A roster of the spring festival season (February), a focus on international real estate activity in Miami (April), and a guide to the local cultural season (October).
Readership and Distribution.
Geared toward the area's professional population, Miami Monthly reaches readers from greater Miami's most affluent neighborhoods and communities. 
Miami Monthly is the area's largest circulated magazine, with an audited print run of 50,900. It is distributed through direct mail, home delivery and strategic commercial, office, condominium and hotel drop locations.

Casa del Herrero

Casa del Herrero (also known as the Steedman Estate) is a home and gardens located in Montecito near Santa Barbara, California. It is an estate designed and constructed in the Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and made a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009. Today the entire site is owned and operated as a historic house museum and garden by the non-profit Casa del Herrero Foundation, with the goal of restoring and preserving the house and grounds.
History.
Casa del Herrero ( 'House of the Blacksmith' ) was designed for George Fox Steedman and his wife, from St. Louis, by the renowned architect George Washington Smith. The residence was completed in 1925, and the Steedmans moved into it the same day as the Santa Barbara earthquake. George Fox Steedman, an industrialist, engineer, and amateur architect, had a vision for the house and grounds that went beyond fashion, and he assembled an extraordinary team of architects, landscape architects, antiquarians, and horticulturists, to produce the Casa del Herrero estate —considered one of the finest examples of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in America. His participation in every detail of the property’s buildings, furnishings, and gardens is the reason the estate makes a single artistic statement that is greater than the sum of its parts. In the 1930s his former associate Lutah Maria Riggs designed the jewel-like octagonal library addition for the Steedmans. 
Steedman died in 1940, and his widow continued to live there until her death in 1962. Their daughter Medora Bass then lived at the Casa until her death in 1987. The foundation to operate the estate was created in 1993 by her son. Today Casa del Herrero is recognized as a masterpiece of the American Country Place era, rare with undiminished acreage and exceptional continuity of stewardship.
Tours.
Docent-led Tours of the Casa del Herrero house, gardens and workshop are available by reservation. The Casa del Herrero Foundation offers the tours on Wednesday and Saturday, at 10 am and 2 pm. The address is 1387 East Valley Road, Montecito, CA 93108.

<doc id="18671783" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18671783" title="The Death of a Soldier">
The Death of a Soldier

"The Death of a Soldier" is a poem from Wallace Stevens's first book
of poetry, "Harmonium."The poem uses free verse to describe the death of a soldier in a detached manner common among reductionist poets.
Overview.
The poem's longevity reinforces the naturalistic austerity
of its depiction of death. One interpretive viewpoint asks whether 
Stevens is writing about any death, or rather, as Longenbach
asserts, the death of the soldier — "and not an ambiguously `fictive' soldier but Eugène Lemercier young French painter killed in 1915 whose letters were collected as "Lettres d'un soldat" and read by Stevens in the summer of 1917." Longenbach claims that the poem's "utter bareness derives from the fact that Stevens was writing not about natural death ... but about a new kind of unnatural death, the daily death of thousands of soldiers on French battlefields."[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/s_z/steven/soldier.htm] 
One response to Longenbach's interpretation is to invoke Stevens's distinction between the true subject of a poem and the poetry of the subject, as he draws it in "The Irrational Element in Poetry".
Now, just as the choice of subject is unpredictable at the outset, so its development, after it has been chosen, is unpredictable. One is always writing about two things at the same time in poetry and it is this that produces the tension characteristic of poetry. One is the true subject and the other is the poetry of the subject. 
Then Lemercier's death would be the true subject, and the poetry of the subject would be anyone's death.
"The Death of a Soldier" and other works by Stevens lead Bates to describe Stevens as "a war poet,
after his fashion," and Ramazani's "Stevens and the War Elegy" expands
on that idea, especially as it relates to post-"Harmonium" poems
that are informed by World War II. 
Bates compares the poem to The Snow Man,
particularly its final stanza, in which the snow man must be "nothing
himself" in order to behold "the nothing that is." In this respect
"The Death of a Soldier" adopts the snow man's point of view,
according to Bates. The soldier has a "Lockean mind":
"He is the sum of his impressions," Bates writes, "identical, in this
instance, with the nothing he does behold."
The soldier's "blank slate" (tabula rasa) becomes a
blank, so to speak, leaving the clouds to go in their direction. Even
if Bates's reading strikes one as strained, the poem marks a departure
from Romantic and Victorian conceptions of death. Death is not 
personified, for instance. Compare Invective Against Swans.
The analogy between death and the season of autumn supports the
interpretive idea that Stevens's care about the weather is interwoven
with reflections on deeper themes such as death and the nature of time.
(See the issue between Vendler and Bloom in the main
Harmonium essay, the section "The
musical Imagist".)
Buttel includes "The Death of a Soldier" as among a handful of
Harmonium poems that most notably anticipate the "more reflective,
more meditative, more serene, but no less intense" poems of Stevens' later work,
not excluding "those magnificent, direct, fervent and profound poems
in "The Rock" at the end — and possibly the summit — of his
career".

List of tallest buildings in Mumbai

Mumbai, the commercial and financial capital of India, has most of the high-rise buildings in India, where land is expensive. More than 2500 high-rise buildings are already constructed in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, in addition to more than a thousand mid-rises existing already. It is the city with the eighteenth highest number of skyscrapers in the world.Most of skyscrapers in Mumbai are residential.
Mumbai is undergoing a massive construction boom, with more than 15 Supertalls, hundreds of skyscrapers and thousands of high-rises under construction.Currently Mumbai is home to largest number of under construction supertalls and skyscrapers in the World.
The original residential skyscrapers in Mumbai were constructed in the 1970s, when Usha Kiran and Matru Mandir were developed and stood at about 250 feet, or 25 floors each. After a significant lull, construction projects since the mid-1990s began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing.
Today in Mumbai there are 44 skyscrapers above 150 m and 132 towers above 100 m.
Tallest buildings.
This lists ranks buildings in Mumbai that stand at least tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Only completed buildings and under-construction buildings that have been topped out are included.

Voitenko compressor

The Voitenko compressor is a shaped charge adapted from its original purpose of piercing thick steel armour to the task of accelerating shock waves. It was proposed by a Russian scientist in 1965. It slightly resembles a wind tunnel.
The Voitenko compressor initially separates a test gas from a shaped charge with a malleable steel plate. When the shaped charge detonates, most of its energy is focused on the steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was a phenomenal . The apparatus exposed to the detonation was, of course, completely destroyed, but not before useful data were extracted. In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates hydrogen gas which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40 km/s. A slight modification to the Voitenko compressor concept is a super-compressed detonation, a device that uses a compressible liquid or solid fuel in the steel compression chamber instead of a traditional gas mixture. A further extension of this technology is the explosive diamond anvil cell, utilizing multiple opposed shaped charge jets projected at a single steel encapsulated fuel, such as hydrogen.The fuels used in these devices,along with the secondary combustion reactions and long blast impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in fuel-air and thermobaric explosives.
This method of detonation produces over 100keV (10^9K) of energy, suitable not only for nuclear fusion, but other higher order quantum reactions as well. The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centered and focused hemispherical implosions to generate neutrons from D-D reactions.The simplest and most direct method proved to be in a predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium-oxygen.The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko-type compressor,where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere. In brief, PETN solid explosive is used to form a hemispherical shell (3mm to 6mm thick) in a 20-cm diameter hemispherical cavity milled in a massive steel chamber. The remaining volume is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of (H2 or D2 and O2). This mixture is detonated by a very short thin exploding wire located at the geometric center. The arrival of the detonation wave at the spherical surface instantly and simultaneously fires the explosive liner. The detonation wave in the explosive liner hits the metal cavity,reflects, and implodes on the preheated burnt gases,focuses at the center of the hemisphere (50 microseconds after the initiation of the exploding wire) and reflects, leaving behind a very small pocket (1mm) of extremely high-temperature, high-pressure and high density plasma.

Erkech dialect

The Erkech dialect is a Bulgarian dialect, which is part of the Balkan group of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. It originates from two villages in the eastern parts of the Balkan Mountains, Kozichino (formerly Erkech) near Pomorie and Golitsa south of Varna. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, speakers of the dialect have established numerous colonies in the regions of Provadia, Varna, Novi Pazar, Balchik, Silistra and Pomorie, thus significantly expanding the range of the dialect. The most significant feature of the dialect, as in all Balkan dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable.
Phonological and morphological characteristics.
Due to the relative isolation of the two villages in the past, the Erkech dialect has a number of idiosyncratic features that separate it from the other Balkan dialects:
Most of the other phonological and morphological characteristics of the Erkech dialect are similar to the general features typical for all Balkan dialects, cf. article for details.

Sparvöga is a 1989 single by Swedish artist Marie Fredriksson, known internationally from the duo Roxette. The single was not originally part of an album, but was written for the TV-series "Sparvöga", which in turn was based on Ann-Charlotte Alverfors's book by the same name. The single was released in March 1989, and the next month peaked at number six on the Swedish charts. As such it was Fredriksson's highest charting single ever until the release of "Där du andas" in 2008, that reached the number one spot.
The Swedish word ""sparvöga"" literally means "sparrow-eye", but is used figuratively to describe particularly sharp human eyes, similar to the English hawk-eye.

1924 Chatham Cup

The 1924 Chatham Cup was the second annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with the numerous local associations being grouped in with the four major regional associations (Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury, and Otago) in qualifying, with each of these four regions being represented in semi-finals by one team, followed by northern and southern semi-finals and a national final. Ten teams from the Wellington region took part, and it is known that Seacliff were the only Otago entrants (North Otago, the home of Oamaru Rangers, being counted as a separate region).
The Auckland representative for the competition was not chosen via a knock-out competition. This raised concerns in some quarters that the rules of the competition were not being adhered to.
The 1924 final.
The final was played in sodden conditions at Wellington. Seacliff took an early lead through W. Simmons, holding on to it until half-time. Harbour Board's Bill Palmer equalised with a header in the second half, and H.M. Margison scored two further goals, one in each half of extra time. The trophy was awarded to the winning team by Wellington Mayor R.A. Wright. The losing semi-finalists contested a Charity Cup during the same weekend at the same venue, the match finishing in a 2-2 draw.

Gyrodon lividus

Gyrodon lividus, commonly known as the alder bolete, is a pored mushroom bearing close affinity to the genus "Paxillus". It is also known as Uloporus lividus by some authorities. Found predominantly in Europe, though also recorded from Japan and California, it is distinguished by its decurrent bright yellow pores which turn blue-grey on bruising. It is edible.
Taxonomy.
It was initially described by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1791 as "Boletus lividus", before being given its current binomial name in 1838 by Elias Magnus Fries. The generic term "Gyrodon" is derived from the Ancient Greek "gyros" "whorl" and "odon" "tooth", while the specific epithet "lividus" is Latin for "lead-coloured". Lucien Quélet described it as "Uloporus lividus" in 1886, and it is still under this binomial in some texts.
Recent molecular research confirms the relations of the genus "Gyrodon" and "Paxillus" as sister taxa, and one of the earliest diverging lineages of the Boletineae.
Description.
"Gyrodon lividus" has a pale brown, buff or ochre cap 4–10 cm (1.6–4 in) in diameter which is convex and later flat in shape, and can be sticky when wet. The tubes and decurrent large pores are bright yellow and turn blue-grey when cut or bruised. The thin flesh is pale yellow. The ringless stipe is initially the same colour as the cap but later darkens to a red-brown; it is 3–7 cm (1.2-2.8 in) high by 1–2 cm wide (0.4-0.8 in). The spore print is olive-brown and the oval spores are 4.5-6 x 3-4 μm. The mushroom has a non-distinctive smell and taste. It is reported as edible by some authors, and inedible by others.
Distribution and habitat.
It has been found in Europe, including Ķemeri National Park in Latvia, and Asia (Japan) and California, under Alder ("Alnus rhombifolia").
As its common name suggests, "Gyrodon lividus" is found under alder ("Alnus rhombifolia"), with which it forms a mycorrhizal relationship. Fruiting bodies may be found alone or in clumps and appear in autumn.

Salvador A. Rodolfo, Sr.

Col. Salvador Rodolfo, Sr. (7 February 1919 – 9 January 2012) was a Filipino soldier who helped liberate the Island Province of Catanduanes in the Philippines from the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. He was known in Catanduanes as “Phantom” or the "Man who Never Dies", based on the comic book hero created by Lee Falk in 1936.
He organized the Catanduanes Liberation Forces (CLF), the guerilla unit that paved the way for the liberation of Catanduanes in 1945. As a result, Japanese forces were destroyed before the American forces arrived in Catanduanes in 1945.
Personal life.
Rodolfo was born in 1919 in Bato, Catanduanes, Philippines. He was a descendant of Don Juan Rodolfo of Almeria, Spain who went to the Philippines in the 18th century and married the daughter of Datu Bantog, who was then one of the Tribal Chieftains in Catanduanes, in order to put to a halt the hostilities between the natives and the Spaniards. The Rodolfos played an important role in Catanduanes politics in the Spanish Colonial Period. His father, Roman Rodolfo, was an undefeated Mayor of Bato, and his mother, Maria Tan Arambulo, was a Chinese businesswoman.
World War II.
When the Second World War broke out, Rodolfo was called to arms in defense of the Philippines against the invading Japanese Imperial Forces. He fought in the three-month Battle of Bataan in 1942, and was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. While in Camp O’Donnel in Capas, Tarlac, he met the then Lt. Ferdinand E. Marcos, who would later on become President of the Philippines. He was released later. After being released from the camp in Capas, Rodolfo organized the Catanduanes Liberation Forces.
Catanduanes Liberation Forces.
The Catanduanes Liberation Forces headed and organized by Rodolfo was the resistance movement in Catanduanes. During this time, Rodolfo was rumored several times to have been killed in battle but returned to fight in Catanduanes, hence he was called “Phantom” or the Man who never dies.
Liberation.
On February 8, 1945, when Rodolfo was about to declare the independence of the province after he and his men killed every Japanese Imperial Army and burned every Japanese garrison in Catanduanes, one of his men approached him and said that there were Japanese reinforcements on board 2 vessels approaching the island. He then talked to his men, most of whom were wounded and exhausted, he said: 
Japanese reinforcements are coming. I have two options for you, we can go to the hills and save ourselves and wait there until the Americans arrive, but I assure you that all civilians left behind will be massacred by the incoming Japanese, or we can repeat what happened in the Battle of Thermopylae and stand our ground. Most of us will die, but we will live forever in the pages of history as the men who fought for the liberation of Catanduanes
With that, everybody decided to stand their ground and fight the incoming Japanese. They went to their posts to wait for the enemy’s arrival but then, as if by providence, American planes arrived and bombed the Japanese vessels. Rodolfo declared independence of the entire province on February 8, 1945.
Later life and death.
In later years, he played a role in local politics in the 80s and 90s serving as Senior Provincial Board Member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and acting Vice Governor in Catanduanes. He was a key ally of the late Gov. Leandro Verceles, Sr. ultimately bringing an end to the political dynasty in the province. 
In 1995, he was appointed as Chief Security Consultant in the Bureau of Immigration under then Commissioner Leandro Verceles during Pres. Fidel V. Ramos Administration. 
He was granted US Citizenship in 1992 after the US Congress passed the law granting citizenship to the USAFFE Veterans who served under Gen. Douglas McArthur. He decided to stay in America for good in 2002. 
He died on January 9, 2012 at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, California. He was a month away from his 93rd birthday. 
He is buried at the Garden of Valor in Valley Oaks-Griffin Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California.

Ignatius von Weitenauer (November 1, 1709 – February 4, 1783) was a German Jesuit writer, exegete, and Orientalist.
Life.
Weitenauer was born at Ingolstadt, Bavaria. His family had been knighted by the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian Joseph. After the ordinary studies of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), which he entered November 3, 1724, he taught for eleven years poetry and rhetoric in several colleges, mainly at Eichstätt. In 1753 he was called to the chair of philosophy and Oriental languages at the University of Innsbruck. When his career as professor was abruptly brought to an end by the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, he followed an invitation of the abbot of the Cistercians of Salem Abbey to continue his literary activity in the monastery. He died at Salem near Constance in Württemberg, at the age of 73.
Works.
Prior to his call to Innsbruck, Weitenauer published several occasional works, festive odes and plays, of high merit. It was, however, during his professorship at Innsbruck that he composed his numerous learned works, the principal of which are:
His extensive linguistic studies bore direct relation to the study of Scripture. Besides he published "Subsidia eloquentiae sacrae" ("Support of Sacred Eloquence", 19 vols., Augsburg, 1764–69). After the suppression of his order appeared "Apparatus catecheticus" ("Catechetic Apparatus", Augsburg, 1775), a collection of 1500 examples, illustrative of the teachings of Christianity. His last great work was a German translation in 12 volumes of both the Old and the New Testament with numerous annotations.

Beyond the Farthest Star (novel)

Beyond the Farthest Star is a science fiction novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The novel consists of two novellas, "Adventure on Poloda" and "Tangor Returns", written quickly in late 1940. The first was published in "The Blue Book Magazine" in 1942, but the second did not see publication until 1964 when it was featured in "Tales of Three Planets" along with "The Resurrection of Jimber-Jaw" and "The Wizard of Venus".
Burroughs likely intended "Beyond the Farthest Star" to be the opening of a new series comparable to the Barsoom or Pellucidar sequences, but declining health and Burroughs's World War II service as a war correspondent prevented this from happening. However, the story saw new life in 1972, when it was adapted by comics writer Marv Wolfman and artist Dan Green as one of the back-ups in DC Comics' version of the Tarzan comic book; the story itself lasted until January 1973 (issues #212-218, then "Tarzan Family" #61). This is the only known comics version to date.

The Subbalkan dialect is a Bulgarian dialect, which is part of the Balkan group of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. Its range includes the northeastern part of Bulgarian Thrace, i.e. the regions of Burgas, Sliven, Yambol, Stara Zagora and Chirpan. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, speakers of the Subbalkan dialect have moved en masse to northeastern Bulgaria and now form a vast portion of the population of the districts of Varna, Dobrich and Balchik. Some of these also went as far as Bessarabia establishing numerous colonies there. Nowadays, a large part of the Bessarabian Bulgarians speak this dialect. The most significant feature of the Subbalkan dialect, as in all Balkan dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable.
Phonological and morphological characteristics.
As a result of its specific characteristics, the Subbalkan dialect is usually considered to be a transitional dialect between the Balkan dialects and the Rup dialects. Most other phonological and morphological characteristics of the Subbalkan dialect are the same as the general features typical for all Balkan dialects, cf. article.

WYTV-DT2

WYTV-DT2 is a digital subchannel of ABC affiliate WYTV for the Mahoning Valley of Northeastern Ohio and Northwestern Pennsylvania. owned by Vaughan Media, but operated through a shared services agreement (SSA) by LIN Media. It is affiliated with MyNetworkTV. It broadcasts in standard definition on 33.2. WYTV-DT2 can also be seen on Time Warner Cable digital channel 373. Syndicated programming on the sub channel includes "Excused", "Cops", "How I Met Your Mother", and "30 Rock" among others.
History.
The subchannels origins began on January 24, 2006 when UPN and The WB announced the two networks would end broadcasting and merge. The combined service would be called The CW. The letters would represent the first initial of corporate parents "C"BS (the parent company of UPN) and the "W"arner Bros. unit of Time Warner. On February 22, News Corporation announced it would start up another new network called MyNetworkTV. This new service, which would be a sister network to Fox, would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television. 
MyNetworkTV was created in order to give UPN and WB stations, not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates, another option besides becoming Independent. It was also created to compete against The CW. On June 13, 2006, WYTV announced that it would launch a new second digital subchannel in September 2006 featuring MyNetworkTV. The move made that station the last full-power channel to launch a secondary subchannel in Youngstown. The official launch occurred September 5 while soon after on September 18 WB outlet "WBCB" (controlled and operated by NBC affiliate WFMJ-TV) became part of The CW television network. 
In Bessemer, Pennsylvania, Comcast replaced Pittsburgh's WPCW with WYTV-DT2 in October despite the former becoming a CW affiliate. Armstrong Cable (one of the market's largest cable systems) carries the station on channel 13 replacing WUAB the MyNetworkTV affiliate in Cleveland. In addition, Comcast and Time Warner Cable systems in Ohio also carry the channel. Comcast carries this station on analog while Time Warner Cable shows it on their digital tier. 
It is currently in the works for WYTV-DT2 to broadcast in high definition. The move leaves the future of the "My Valley Weather" subchannel on WYTV-DT3 uncertain although that service is not even offered on area cable systems right now. As of March 2012, however, WYTV-DT2 is still seen in standard definition. At its sign-on, it originally aired eighteen hours of original local programming each week and another 30½ hours of programming that was not original. The station carries taped high school football and basketball "Game of the Week" match-ups as well as tape delayed Youngstown State University football along with men's and women's basketball home games. It also aired Mahoning Valley Thunder arena football games and currently show select Mahoning Valley Scrappers baseball games. 
For a period as a separate station, WYTV produced a prime time newscast at 10 on this MyNetworkTV second digital subchannel. This competed with another broadcast airing at the same time on Fox affiliate WYFX that is still produced today by WKBN. WYTV-DT2 currently repeats the main channel's weekday morning show from 7 until 9 that is known as "33 News at Daybreak". This broadcast features news anchor Len Rome (who is also a health reporter, "Good Question" segment producer, and feature reporter), weather caster Jim Loboy, and news reporter Greta Mittereder (who also produces the "Greta On The Go" segment).

Hollow Earth Expedition

Hollow Earth Expedition is a pulp 1930s role-playing game set in the fictitious "Hollow Earth", published by Exile Game Studio. The game has been nominated for several Origins and ENnie awards since its release in 2006.
The main rule book is Hollow Earth Expedition, and it is often abbreviated as HEX.
System.
Hollow Earth Expedition uses the Ubiquity rules, which were also created by Exile Game Studio. The main feature of the system is its use of binary dice pool rolls to determine success. Under the default rules, each even number rolled counts as a success, while odd numbers count as nothing. Odd 'nothings' do not cancel out even 'successes', making dice rolling quick and simple. This binary system has also led to the development of special Ubiquity Dice, which are not detailed below.
Game setting.
The surface world.
Hollow Earth Expedition is set in the 1930s. On the surface, everything appears as it does in our real world history books, but if you dig a little deeper you encounter secret societies and villainous organizations, many of whom have a vested interest in the Hollow Earth.
Two organizations are detailed in the main rulebook: the Terra Arcana and the Thule Society. Further organizations are listed in the first expansion, Secrets of the Surface World.
The Terra Arcanum in an esoteric society dedicated to keeping the Hollow Earth a secret. They have their foundations deep in the mists of time, and only a few of their current members realize their true origins.
The Thule Society are based on an actual organization associated with the Nazi party during World War II. In HEX they have a deep interest in getting into the Hollow Earth and the powerful ancient weapons they believe are kept there.
The Hollow Earth.
The Hollow Earth boasts a wide selection of beasts and humans. Dinosaurs and other extinct creatures still live and hunt and are hunted by the various human groups who have become stranded in the Hollow Earth over the centuries. Not a great deal of detail is provided about the Hollow Earth in the main book, allowing Game Masters to customize the terrain to suit their campaign.
Mysteries of the Hollow Earth expands a great deal on the denizens of Hollow Earth, including rules for beastmen of various sorts, and provides details such as a map and gazetteer for those GMs who want a more fleshed-out world, rather than the more nebulous "land of mysteries" from the core book.

John Verrall

John Weedon Verrall (born Britt, Iowa, June 17, 1908; died April 15, 2001) was an American composer of contemporary classical music.
Life.
Prior to his University studies, Verrall studied composition with Donald Ferguson, followed by studies with R. O. Morris in London and Zoltán Kodály in Budapest. He obtained a B.M. degree from the Minneapolis School of Music in 1929, and a B.A. from the University of Minnesota in 1934. In the early 1930s he spent several summers at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, where he studied composition with Aaron Copland, Roy Harris, and Frederick Jacobi. He taught at Hamline University from 1934–1942 and Mount Holyoke College from 1942–1946, during which time he briefly served in the U.S. Army during World War II. While teaching at Mount Holyoke College, Verall also worked as a music editor for G. Schirmer. In 1946 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1948 he joined the music faculty at the University of Washington, where he taught composition and music theory until he retired as professor emeritus in 1973. Several of Verrall's students have gone on to have successful careers, including William Bolcom, Alan Stout, and Gloria Wilson Swisher.
Compositions.
From the late 1940s, Verrall used as the tonal basis for his music a nine-pitch scale consisting of two tetrachords on either side of a central pitch, itself alterable (C–D–E–E, F or F, G–A–B–B). This collection lends itself to symmetrical harmonic formations and melodic contours which, with equivalent rhythmic and metrical formations, generate the global and local pitch and rhythmic relations in his music.
Verrall wrote numerous symphonic works and chamber music pieces including four symphonies, seven string quartets, a violin concerto, and a viola concerto, among many other works. He also wrote several vocal art songs, choral works, and three operas.
Personal life.
His wife was named Margaret. He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Laurelhurst, Seattle, Washington, at the age of 92.
The John Verrall Papers are held by the Special Collections department of the University of Washington Libraries.

Mandalay National Wildlife Refuge established in 1996, is located in Terrebonne Parish, southwest of Houma, Louisiana. It is one of eight refuges of the Southeast Louisiana National Wildlife Refuge Complex (SELA).
The refuge is composed of freshwater marsh and cypress-tupelo swamp. The refuge provides habitat for waterfowl, wading birds, and neotropical songbirds. Access is by boat only and foot travel is extremely difficult due to the soft marsh environment. The refuge is open year round to the public from sunrise to sunset, with seasonal restrictions in some areas. Wildlife observation, boating and fishing are allowed on the refuge year round except in areas closed to public access. Hunting is permitted on the refuge in specific areas and under date, time, and lottery restrictions.
The Friends of Louisiana Wildlife Refuges is a non-profit, membership organization that supports and advocates for the SELA Refuges. They sponsor several of the refuge annual events, obtain grants to support refuge projects, conduct fund-raising activities to support environmental education programs and help the Fish and Wildlife Service operate and maintain the refuge facilities and programs by conducting weekend volunteer work days.

"Need for Speed" is a series of racing video games where the main objective is to win races in a variety of game modes, in the process eluding traffic, pedestrians, and police. Customization of video game vehicles was an aspect first introduced by the "Need for Speed" series after the release of the film, "The Fast and The Furious"; it is a feature included in every "Need for Speed" title from the release of "" through the untitled 2011 title. Initially, the series was exclusive to the fifth generation consoles and was featured in all of the seventh generation video game consoles by 2008.
The NFS series is among the best-selling video game franchises with 100 million copies sold. Electronic Arts considers one of the reasons the series has remained so popular is because "the series has long been an ever-evolving franchise, one that changes up its focus, mechanics and style every couple of years."
Other games.
There were also two Japanese only titles: "Over Drivin' Skyline Memorial" for the PlayStation and "Nissan Presents Over Drivin' GT-R" for the Sega Saturn. They are different versions of the first "Need for Speed".

Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge

Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1992 to preserve waterfowl habitat and hardwood forest of the lower Mississippi river. The refuge is located in Concordia Parish, Louisiana, southwest of Vidalia, Louisiana. It is named for the state-designated scenic river of Bayou Cocodrie.
The Nature Conservancy purchased an core tract in 1991 from the Fisher Lumber Company, a subsidiary of General Motors Corporation. The Conservancy then sold the land to the US Fish and Wildlife Service over a span of five years.
The bottomland hardwoods at Bayou Cocodrie have been noted as some of the last remaining, least disturbed timber of what historically was once a vast hardwood forest along the Mississippi River from Illinois to Louisiana.
Flora and fauna.
The majority of the refuge is hardwood forest of oak, gum, and ash. A site of hardwood is designated a Natural Resource Area for study purposes. The remaining habitat is wetlands utilized by wintering waterfowl such as mallard, pintail and shoveler duck species. The wood duck is found in the refuge and is one of the reasons for the establishment of the Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge. Other birds include Bald Eagle, Peregrine Falcon, Osprey and Swainson's warbler. At least 186 bird species have been identified in the refuge.
The Louisiana black bear, federally listed as threatened since 1992, is known to occur in the Bayou Cocodrie. The historic range of the Louisiana black bear included southern Louisiana, Mississippi and east Texas, and is a subspecies of the American black bear.

The Pirdop dialect is a Bulgarian dialect, which is part of the Balkan group of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. Its range includes the towns of Pirdop, Zlatitsa and Koprivshtitsa, as well as several neighbouring villages. The most significant feature of the dialect, as in all Balkan dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable. However, the Pirdop dialect also features a number of characteristics which bring it closer to the neighbouring Western Bulgarian dialects, and especially to the Botevgrad dialect and which, in turn, separate it from the rest of the Balkan dialects.

Comic Book Tattoo

Comic Book Tattoo is an Eisner Award and Harvey Award-winning anthology graphic novel made up of fifty-one stories, each based on or inspired by a song by American singer-songwriter Tori Amos, published by Image Comics in 2008. Rantz Hoseley, longtime friend of Amos, served as the book's editor. Together, Hoseley and Amos gathered eighty different artists to collaborate on the book. "Comic Book Tattoo" includes an introduction by another longtime friend of Amos, Neil Gaiman, creator of "The Sandman" series.
Background.
From the start, it was decided that "Comic Book Tattoo" would not contain comic book versions of music videos for Amos's songs, nor illustrations created from literal interpretations of Amos's lyrics. Of her role in the project, editor Hoseley said, "It was very important to that she see how the different creators were treating 'her girls' (the songs), but at the same time, not tying the creator's hands or make them feel restricted in any way and making sure that they felt the freedom to tell the kind of story that they felt strongly about." When approached to contribute to the project, the graphic artists were asked to create a story that reflects that which the songs make them feel.
About the finished collection, Amos said, "I have been surprised, excited and pleasantly shocked by these comics that are extensions of the songs that I have loved and therefore welcome these amazing stories of pictures and words because they are uncompromisingly inspiring. It shows you thought is a powerful, formidable essence and can have a breathtaking domino effect."

Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge

The Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge is located about west of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and one mile (1.6 km) east of Krotz Springs, Louisiana lies just east of the Atchafalaya River. In 1988 under the administration of Governor Foster the "Atchafalaya Basin Master Plan" was implemented that combined the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area (WMA), the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Bayou Des Ourses (Bayou of the Bears) into the Sherburne Complex Wildlife Management Area.
History.
The National Wildlife refuge system began in 1903, by executive order of President Theodore Roosevelt, with the designation of Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. The Atchafalaya NWR became part of a system that includes more than in 552 national wildlife refuges, along with other units of the refuge system, and 37 wetland management districts. The refuge was established in 1986, to provide for 1) conservation and management of all fish and wildlife within the refuge, 2) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife, and 3) to provide opportunities for scientific research, environmental education, and fish and wildlife oriented recreation, including hunting, fishing and trapping, birdwatching, nature photography, and others.
Wildlife and habitat.
The refuge is encompassed within of hardwood swamps, lakes and bayous. The natural floodplain of the Atchafalaya River flows for south from its junction with the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. The basin's dense bottomland hardwoods, Bald Cypress-Tupelo swamps, overflow lakes, and meandering bayous provide a tremendous diversity of habitat for more than 200 species of resident and migratory birds and numerous other wildlife and the area has been recognized as an Internationally Important Bird Area.
The basin's wooded wetlands also provide vital nesting habitat for Wood Duck, and support the nation's largest concentration of American Woodcock. Bald Eagles, Ospreys, Swallow-tailed Kites, and Mississippi Kites can occasionally be seen soaring overhead. Wild Turkeys, White-tailed deer, Eastern Gray and Fox Squirrels, Eastern Cottontail, Swamp Rabbit, Gray and Red Fox, Coyote, Striped Skunk, and Virginia Opossum inhabit the refuge, as do a small remnant population of Louisiana Black Bears. Furbearers found in this great swamp are Raccoon, Mink, Bobcat, Coypu, Muskrat, North American River Otter, and American Beaver.
The lifeblood of the fishery is the basin's annual flooding and dewatering cycle. Overflows occur during the winter and spring rains, with many areas gradually becoming dewatered during the summer and fall. Sportfishing is popular throughout the basin. Largemouth bass, White crappie, Black crappie, Warmouth, Bluegill, Redear sunfish, and Channel catfish are the primary species sought. More than 85 species of fish occur in the basin, and their populations frequently exceed 1,000 pounds per acre (100 g/m²). Red Swamp and White River Crayfish are also important for both a sport and commercial harvest.
Refuge area.
The combined area of the refuge, totaling , classified as bottomland hardwoods, contains four dominant tree species associations: (1) cottonwood and sycamore, (2) oak, gum (American Sweetgum or Redgum), hackberry (Sugarberry or Sugar Hackberry), ash (Swamp or water ash), (3) willow (Black Willow), bald cypress, pumpkin ash, (4) overcup oak, and bitter pecan or water hickory.
Flood of 2011.
Due to the flooding of the Mississippi River and the opening of the Morganza Floodway the refuge was closed to the public May 14, 2011. This was the first time since 1973, and prior to the refuge opening, that the Mississippi was diverted through the basin. Although most of the refuge remains closed the South Farm (Iberville Parish) portion of the Sherburne WMA was open July 1, 2011, to walk-in and ATV traffic. The rest of the area will be closed until further notice.

John Bethune (clergyman)

The Reverend John Bethune (1751 – September 23, 1815) founded the first Presbyterian Church in Montreal and was the patriarch of a notable Canadian family prominently connected with the fur trade, politics, medicine, law and the church. He was the great-great-grandfather of Norman Bethune, the Canadian physician and medical innovator, and the great-great-great-grandfather of Canadian actor Christopher Plummer.
Scotland.
Born into a well-respected family on the Isle of Skye, he was a son of Angus Bethune and Christian, daughter of Donald Campbell (1696-1784) of Scalpay. His maternal grandfather was best remembered for his involvement in the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746, following the Battle of Culloden. The Prince was taken to Scalpay, to the home of Donald and Catherine (MacDonald) Campbell, which was a great risk as Donald Campbell was known to have supported the cause of the House of Hanover. Nevertheless, Bethune's grandfather's innate sense of hospitality to strangers and loyalty to his wife's Jacobite family meant that he welcomed and protected the Prince, despite their religious and political differences.
American Revolution.
Though descended from the Lairds of Balfour, Bethune needed scholarships to keep him at King's College, Aberdeen. In 1773, he was ordained and under the influence of his relation, Allan MacDonald, Laird of Kingsburgh, Skye, (the husband of the Jacobite heroine Flora MacDonald), he and his mother emigrated to North Carolina where they lived in the same place as the MacDonalds. As a Loyalist in MacDonald's Highland Regiment, Bethune fought at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge in February 1776, but was captured by the victorious rebels along with a great many of MacDonald's men. He was eventually released and made his way to Montreal, where he was appointed chaplain to the 1st battalion of the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants).
Canada.
In 1784, upon the demobilization of his regiment, Bethune ministered to a small band of Presbyterian Scots and in 1786 established the first Presbyterian Church on St Gabriel's Street, Montreal, which became the mother church of Presbyterianism in Canada. One year later he came to Glengarry (spelled Glengary at the time) to be among the loyalist settlers of his regiment. Settling at his home (now a national historic site, later occupied by David Thompson) in Williamstown, here he devoted the remainder of his life to his ministry. The harmonious and amicable relations among the denominations is now legendary. The Roman Catholic Bishop at St Raphael's, Alexander Macdonell, prided himself on his knowledge of Protestant prayers by which he could fill in for Bethune when needed.
Family.
In 1782, before the close of the war, Bethune married Veronique Wadin (d.1846), daughter of Jean-Étienne Wadin (1738–1782), a founding partner of the North West Company. Veronique's mother was half Cree, and she was the sister of Maguerite, wife of Dr. John McLauglin, Father of Oregon. After Bethune's death, Veronique Bethune resided happily with her daughter Christine and son-in-law Robert Henry at Cobourg for 31 years and was regarded by distinguished travellers of the period as a lady of great wit and charm. The Bethunes were the parents of ten children (all the sons were educated by John Strachan) and one adopted daughter, Ann McLeod:

Presidential Guard Battalion (Brazil)

The Presidential Guard Battalion (; BGP) is a unit of the Brazilian Army and honor guard to the President of Brazil. Two other units, the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (; RCG; also known as the "Independence Dragoons") and the Cayenne Battery, are also part of the presidential honor guard.
This troop had its origins in the Emperor’s Battalion, organized in 1823 during the peace campaigns that followed the Declaration of Independence and wears its 19th-century uniforms.
History.
After Portugal's Crown Prince Pedro had proclaimed the independence of Brazil from Portugal, on September 7, 1822, some troops remained loyal to Portugal. To guarantee the independence, these troops had to be defeated. To fight the troops in Bahia, Pedro established in 1823 the Emperor’s Battalion.
In 1825, the Emperor’s Battalion was sent to Montevideo to fight at Cisplatine War. After Pedro's abdication, the Emperor’s Battalion was dismissed, as all other troops directly subordinated to them.
On April 7, 1933, President Getúlio Vargas established the Guards Battalion to protect the government's palaces. The decree determined that this battalion was heir to Emperor’s Battalion and would use its uniforms at special ceremonies and celebrations. On April 6, 1960, with the transfer of the national capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília, the unit changed its name to Presidential Guard Battalion.
The most important officer of the Presidential Guard Battalion was the 2nd Liutenant Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, the Duke of Caxias.

James S. Calhoun

James S. Calhoun (1802–1852) was best known as the Governor of New Mexico Territory from 1851 to 1852. He had many careers, though, including time as a Georgian politician, military colonel, and bureaucrat in the United States government. 
While in his thirties and forties, Calhoun served in a variety of political roles in his home state of Georgia. First, he was elected as a member of Georgia state legislature in 1830. Later, Calhoun became mayor of Columbus, Georgia from 1838 to 1839. Finally, he served in the Georgia state senate from 1838 to 1840 and again in 1845. In between his terms in the state senate, he also acted as the U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba from 1841 to 1842.
Calhoun held the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army during the Mexican War. Following the war, Calhoun remained in the border region and held key positions with the U.S. government. First, the President appointed Calhoun the federal Indian Agent for the newly acquired territory of New Mexico. During his two-year tenure in that position, Calhoun used various tactics to convince or coerce Pueblo Native Americans to renounce their rights under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as former Mexican citizens. Calhoun claimed that he only sought to "protect" the Pueblos from their Mexican-American neighbors by excluding them from territorial affairs. The end result, though, was the disenfranchisement of thousands of Pueblo individuals. It would take decades of legal action by Pueblo communities to reverse that position.
President Millard Fillmore later appointed Calhoun as Governor of New Mexico Territory in 1851. One of his first acts as Governor was to propose laws restricting the movement of "free Negroes" into New Mexico. He garnered the support of wealthy Mexicans who feared for their own racial status in the U.S. Prior to the end of his term as governor of the territory, Calhoun died of scurvy near Independence, Missouri, carrying his own coffin, while en route to Washington D.C. and eventually for his home in Georgia. He was buried on the plains.

ART and EXHIBITION.
Turkle's paintings and sculptures have been widely exhibited in museums and galleries throughout the United States and Europe. Turkle first exhibited his artworks at White Columns and CABLE in Greenwich Village and later at the Greenberg Wilson Gallery in SoHo. He is cited for his innovative use of liquid acrylic and for developing the technique of controlled pouring to produce large scale paintings and sculptures.

Cachaça Schermann

Brand of "artisanal cachaça" in Brazil. 
Traditionally produced in two varieties: white (silver) and aged (gold) since 1899 in Pirassununga city, state of São Paulo. Are also the producers of Cachaca Bayu and Brazil Cachaça who belong to the same family.
History.
On March 1, 1888, Giacomo and Luigia Scherma and their four children, namely Anna Maria, Domenico, Giovanni and Antonio, arrived in Brazil on St. Martino steamship, at the Santos port. Like most Italian immigrants to Brazil, they also headed to the countryside of São Paulo state, in order to work on coffee crops on farms. And that is how the history of a product began; a product that, years later, would become of the best distilled drinks appreciated all over the world.
The Scherma family began producing cachaça, which used to be sold in bulk to relatives, friends and wholesalers who bottled and sold it. That is actually how most large cachaça makers in the Pirassununga region started. The Schermann cachaças have continuously been made since then and are kept under the same tradition for four generations.
The Schermann family, little by little, added other products to the ones produced in the first distillery, which is still operational to date.

Dorohedoro

Plot.
The plot of the manga centers around Kaiman, who does not remember who he was before he was transfigured by a "Magic User". This transformation left him with a reptile's head, and a desire to find out the truth about who he really is. Accompanied by Nikaido, his female companion, he tracks down Magic Users in the Hole and unceremoniously chomps down on their head, hoping to find out who it was that put him in this state. One by one, they witness this "second man" inside the head of Kaiman, and after pulling them back out of his mouth he asks them all the same question...
""What did the guy inside my mouth say?""
Magic.
There are two separate worlds in "Dorohedoro", the Hole, where people who cannot use magic live, and the world of magic users. Magic users are individuals who offer gifts to the devil in hope of receiving a unique mask in return. Magic users frequently wear these masks, only removing them for instances of food consumption, possible identification purposes, or simply leisure. Magic users can produce "smoke" which is the source of their powers. There are several different types of smoke such as transformation, healing and resurrection. It is known that there are magic users who can alter time but that gift is very rare and often thought to be a myth. Usually one magic user can only use one type of smoke (for example : a user with healing ability cannot do transformations, or a user with lizard transformation abilities cannot do mushroom transformations). However, smoke can be sold and bought. In bottled or spray form it can be used by other individuals, magic users or not. Magic can be amplified by consuming black powder but this act is looked down upon in the society and regarded as shameful. Frequent use of this black powder turns a magic user's smoke potent for indefinite amount of time. Remains of black powder can be found in the user's smoke.
Magic users often frequent the Hole for experimenting with their powers or "fun". Their victims are usually left incapacitated or on the verge of death. The residue left by magic users in their world falls down in the Hole as rain. This rain reduces the powers of magic users.
Non Magic.
Those who cannot use magic, seek refuge or wish to hide their abilities dwell in the Hole. These people live their everyday lives, sometimes at the mercy of visiting Magic users who make a plaything of their world—and them.
Settings.
The World of "Dorohedoro" seems to be set in a post-apocalyptic world which is split in to two major factions.
The Magic User World.
Magic Users are those who can produce black smoke, which in turn can perform magical feats expanding past the capacity of normal human beings. These people all wear masks, made for them by the devil. They live in one world, but frequent The Hole for testing of their powers and in some cases, simple fun. The way of transport through worlds is done by summoning doors to take the user from place to place. Other methods of transportation shown have been in flying carpets, and other enchanted objects. A caste system exists there where users with high-level magic are exacted special rights and quality of life. Magic users with low-level magic are often treated with contempt by superior users and live in poverty. At the very top of the system are devils who seem to enforce what little amounts to the law.
The Hole.
The Hole is where those who are without magic reside, often the plaything of visiting magic users. Almost considered a dump, many areas are condemned if not nearing so. However, despite the odds there are some surviving businesses, a large one of which being the hospital for those who have been the victims of magic.
Main characters.
Kaiman.
Kaiman is the lead character of the manga. He appears to have been the victim of a transformation, memories of which he is convinced have a man having laid the spell on him. Other than that, he has no recollection of his previous life. He sports the head of a large reptile, with no other alternates in limbs or body. (He's quite human right down to the head.) His head sports various spikes that jar out when he is surprised or stressed, and there are cross-shaped marks over each of his eyes. It appears that despite having his head chopped off, he can regenerate it in a matter of time. It is eventually shown that Kaiman is actually a character called Aikawa, only previously shown in Risu's flashbacks. Not only this, but that he is part of a conglomerate entity, along with the leader of the Cross-Eyes and several unknown people. 
It is strongly hinted that Kaiman/Aikawa was actually the mysterious leader of the Cross-Eyes and is later confirmed in Volume 13. The Cross-Eyes leader was originally a human named Ai from Hole, whom Professor Kasukabe attempted to turn into a Magic User at his behest. Ai then encountered Dokuga and his buddies, and formed the Cross-Eyes with them. He then began hunting Elite Magic Users along with Dokuga and his friends. This provoked En, who sent Noi and Shin to deal with the Cross-Eyes. However, they were easily overpowered by Ai and were nearly killed. They were saved by En's appearance, and promptly retreated. En faced the Cross-Eyes leader, and wanting to end it quickly by playing it safe, he released an enormous quantity of Smoke, obliterating the entire city of Kasmet. However, while barely conscious due to the collapse of the ground, he saw the silhouette of a headless figure walking away. He is haunted by this incident till the current time and went so far as forcing Nikaido to be his partner, just so he could use her powers to confirm whether The Leader really perished or not. 
It is unknown exactly how the surgery Professor Kasukabe worked, but it seems to have changed Ai significantly. He is not explicitly shown using Smoke when he fought Shin and Noi or En, but all three of them felt an eerie sense of disquiet when facing him. They feel it again when they encounter him six years later and recognise it. Ai seems to be extremely powerful, being a master of the knife and possessing extreme speed. He easily kills En in Volume 12, decapitating him. He later removes the Devil Tumor from En's head and surprisingly uses En's Magic against Shin and Noi, severely injuring them. The Magic, as noted by Shou, seemed much more potent than En's as even an Elite regenerative Magic User like Noi required a month to regain consciousness. 
It is shown that Aikawa/Kaiman are actually a split personality of Ai.
Nikaido.
Kaiman's present companion, and a woman who owns the Hungry Bug, a family restaurant in The Hole. She found Kaiman after his initial transformation, and has befriended and aided him ever since. They, together, hunt down magic users who enter The Hole, and try to locate the one who inflicted the transformation on Kaiman. As it progresses, it is revealed that Nikaido is also a magic user, and has some ties in the Magic Users' World. It is later revealed her magic involves the control of time. When she trains with the ex-devil, Asu, she discovers that her magic can only be used a limited number of times before eventually becoming completely unusable.
En.
En is shown to be the Corporate boss of a business that sells mushroom based products, ranging from food, weaponry, psychedelics and housing. He's shown to be a man who has a large expansive group of lackeys, and is Noi and Shin's boss. He wears a mask that holds over his mouth similar to a surgeon's mask, and his smoke can turn people and objects in to mushrooms. He is also quite fond of mushrooms, so much so that he themes every product he sells after them, and tends to only eat mushrooms.
From the moment he was born En was surrounded by mushrooms, to which he today thinks he transformed his parents into mushrooms, and survived on eating them until a man entered his house and sold him off to a group who extracted and sold smoke from magic users. He escaped when he was nine, where he was found by a devil who dumped him into hell. En only survived the journey into hell, as he was so full of hate that he couldn't risk dying before extracting revenge. In hell he survived, by creating mushrooms to feed upon, some time after his devil Chidaruma found him and gave him the name 'En' then sent him back to the surface. A year and a half later he extracted his revenge against the workers in the factory who stole the magic of others, he destroyed the factory and made all the victims inside his friends. It was from there his criminal empire began to grow.
Shin & Noi.
Shin and Noi are enforcers for En, a powerful leader of a corporation in The Magic Users' realm. As partners, Shin and Noi are commonly shown competing with one another while on a job, placing bets on who can kill more people, or a person faster. Noi refers to Shin often as "Senpai", a reflection of her position in the corporation (that of one who has come after Shin).
Shin is one of the most powerful fighters in the manga and works as a cleaner in En's organization as Noi's partner. He fights with a hammer as a weapon and uses magic smoke which chops up victims into slices without killing them. Shin's mask is shaped like a human heart, although he usually wears it backwards with the front of it facing backwards and two eye holes cut out of the back. Without a mask he is blond with blue eyes, and wears glasses. He is usually in a suit with an un-tucked white shirt and sneakers.
Noi is a powerful cleaner for En's organization and also En's younger cousin. Although female, she is heavily muscled and towering in height. Noi's hair in the Bonus Chapter of 17 is pale white-blond like, and her eyes appear red—suggesting she might be an albino. Her hair is mid length, and she has several piercings on her ears. Her smoke heals almost any injury short of actual death. She is very affectionate to Shin, sometimes to his exasperation. Noi's mask is very detailed, although dark blue and apparently vinyl-like.
Fujita.
Fujita is a magic user residing in the Magic user's domain, working for a company headed by En: a powerful magic user. Fujita isn't a very good magic user at all.
Wanting to avenge his comrade, Fujita sets out to return to Hole heavily armed but is stopped by a messenger of En, who passes on the message that he's been assigned to find the user who transformed Kaiman into a saurian. A bit of research reveals a reptilian transformation specialist—Ebisu. Fujita recalls passing her while in the Hole with his friend—and so, goes to find her before Kaiman can kill her, too. Fujita's timing is just right, and so he manages to save Ebisu just as she's stuck in the jaws of Kaiman, her fingers cut clean off after she attempts to use her smoke on him. Unfortunately, her life comes at the price of her sanity and her face—En assigns one of the higher-ups, Noi, to heal Ebisu's face and fingers. Although physically in one piece once again, Ebisu is still traumatized by the incident, her personality reverted to that of a small child and memory obliterated.
Noi and Shin are sent to exterminate Kaiman—Fujita tagging along partially because he wants revenge, partially to watch after Ebisu, of whose memory everyone is waiting on to return.
Fujita wears a trapper hat and a Tengu mask, and is known to cover his eyes during horror movies.
His magic has yet to be defined, although he fired his smoke like bullets on one occasion.
Ebisu.
Ebisu is a young and sullen looking woman who first appears in chapter three, donning a skull shaped mask. She is walking through the Hole, unable to summon a door back to the Magic Users' world due to the barrier between worlds in effect. She runs in to Kaiman and Nikaido, who advance on her in their common fashion. Kaiman cuts off Ebisu's fingers to prevent her from using magic, and bites down on her head after removing her mask. Before he can withdraw to ask her his "question", a frantic Fujita appears from a door behind her and forcefully pulls her out of his clamped down jaws, in to the door. This sudden and jerky movement causes trauma to her face and head, but they both get to safety.
After this incident, Ebisu is shown to be haunted by nightmares - and has become somewhat insane. At En's residence, she is restrained until Noi can properly heal and restore her fingers and face. Past that point, it is evident her head trauma caused some (supposedly temporary,) brain damage as seen in her suddenly eccentric behavior. She is commonly seen with Fujita in the manga panels.
Records state she is skilled in Reptile transformation. However between panels it shows her having attacked someone with a surplus of power after being fed Black Powder by someone who appeared to have met her before. It is revealed she was a black smoke user, and had heard the words said to her from the man inside Kaiman's head. Some of her memories return when she herself transforms into a large dinosaur-like lizard, proving that the consumption of black powder from a young age has caused an increase in power. It is eventually revealed that she was the one who hexed Kaiman when she is temporarily killed and the spell is lifted from Kaiman. It is revealed later that this is due to a bottle of her smoke that she had sold, and not a direct curse.

Marie Kachel Bucher

Marie Elizabeth Kachel Bucher (November 21, 1909  – July 27, 2008) was an American schoolteacher and the last surviving resident member of the German Seventh-Day Baptists religious community of the Ephrata Cloister, a United States National Historic Landmark located in Ephrata, Pennsylvania.
Biography.
Marie Elizabeth Kachel was born in 1909. Her parents were Reuben S. Kachel and M. Kathryn Zerfass Kachel. She had four sisters and one brother. She was raised on Shady Nook Farm during her early life, which was located in what is now known as the Ephrata Cloister. Her family, who were one of its last residents, often gave tours of the Ephrata Cloister, which was founded by Johann Conrad Beissel in 1732. The Ephrata Cloister was later purchased by the state of Pennsylvania. Today the Ephrata Cloister is administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission as a state museum and tourist attraction.
Kachel graduated from Ephrata High School in 1927. She earned her bachelor's of science degree from Millersville State Teachers College, which is now known as Millersville University, in 1935. She later earned her Masters degree in education from Penn State University in 1939. Additionally, Kachel also studied at Duke University and Elizabethtown College.
Kachel began her teaching career at a one room schoolhouse in Clay Township, Pennsylvania, in northern Lancaster County. She later moved to southern Lancaster County to take a position in the now-defunct East Drumore Township school district. She retired from teaching after working as a math teacher at Solanco High School, a public high school for many years.
Kachel married her husband, Loren H. Bucher, an East Drumore Township farmer, in 1945. They had two children, Loren K. Bucher and Christina Bucher. Kachel Bucher never formally joined the Church of the Brethren, but taught adult Bible study and remained active in the Church's congregation in Mechanics Grove, Pennsylvania. In her later years, Bucher wrote and researched a book on the history of the Church of the Brethren's Mechanics Grove congregation entitled ""A Century of Service at the Grove"". Bucher was 87 years old when the book was written and published in 1997.
Marie Elizabeth Kachel Bucher died at the Quarryville Presbyterian Home in Quarryville, Pennsylvania, on July 27, 2008, at the age of 98. She had resided at the nursing home since November 2007. Her death marked the passing of the last surviving resident of the Ephrata Cloister. Her funeral was held at the Saal at the Ephrata Cloister on July 31, 2008, and she was buried at Mt. Zion Cemetery.
Bucher was survived by her children, Loren and Christina. She had been preceded in death by her husband and her siblings; four sisters - Kitty Kachel Strickler, Dorothy Kachel Grabill, Margaret P. Kachel, and Ruth Kachel Donough - and her brother, Daniel S. Kachel.

A pauper at death, he became noted as a folk figure and minor celebrity after his body was preserved as a mummy after his death. He was finally buried in 1994, 66 years after his drowning in the Ohio River, and the event was covered by national media.
Biography.
Charles Atkins was born in Tennessee and, as an adult, moved to Kentucky to find work. Not much is known about his life. He settled in downtown Paducah as an hourly employee at a plant with ties to the tobacco industry.
He gained the nickname "Speedy" at work because of his speed with tobacco. He was also known as a womanizer. Single and without known relatives, he befriended A. Z. Hamock, an African American who, in a segregated city, owned the city's only funeral home for blacks.
In May 1928, Speedy went fishing and fell with his line into the Ohio River, where he drowned. The city transferred his body to Hamock's Funeral Home for a pauper's burial. Having created a powerful preservative, Hamock decided to experiment with it to preserve Speedy's body. The mixture transformed the corpse into a wooden-like statue. While Atkins' black skin was altered to a reddish color, Speedy's facial features remained recognizable.
Hamock put the preserved body of Speedy on occasional display at the funeral home and kept it mostly in a closet. He did not charge a fee for viewers. Washed away during the Paducah flood of 1937 on the Ohio River, Speedy's body was returned to the funeral home as a flood victim.
After Hamock died in 1949, his wife Velma took over custody of Speedy's body. She kept it for another 45 years before burial. During the 66 years that Speedy's body was preserved, the man became known as a folk figure and minor celebrity.
Mrs. Hamock planned to bury the mummy in 1991 on her late husband's 100th birthday, but waited until May 1994. About 200 people attended his funeral and burial in Maplelawn Cemetery, in Paducah.
Because of his body's unique condition, "Speedy" Atkins has been featured in national media as well as Ripley's Believe It Or Not, the TV program "That's Incredible," and the "National Enquirer" His story was also told on the Discovery Channel.

Uroboros (album)

Uroboros (stylized UROBOROS) is the seventh studio album by Japanese metal band Dir En Grey. It was released on November 11, 2008 in the United States by The End Records and, due to the time difference, November 12, 2008 in Japan through Firewall and European releases by Gan-Shin. The album is named after the Ouroboros symbol, which is a dragon or snake figure depicted in full circle consuming itself. This represents continuity and the cycle of power, emphasizing the theme of reincarnation, an idea propagated heavily by the band during promotion.
The album art, designed by the band's long-time artist Koji Yoda, was conceived with inspiration from King Crimson's 1970 album "Lizard".
Background and production.
Following the finale of their 2007 touring, much of the song writing was completed on an individual basis in January and February 2008, without the members meeting to collaborate. The original announcement of recording was slated for the beginning of 2008, while it was later announced that the album began pre-production in March 2008. The members regrouped after two months of solitary working and shared their independently developed tracks, with guitarist Kaoru saying the intent was to show "I'm making this song right now," with the intent of producing a larger variety of songs. Recording of the first tracks then began in the spring in the Sony Building in Tokyo. Dir En Grey later returned to the pre-production phase for the remaining tracks of the album.
The band recorded with many new instruments, including mandolin, congas, electric sitar, and biwa to create a unique sound, and vocalist Kyo sets emphasis on "non-screaming vocals," accentuating softer composition, while still blending in his unique screams, screeches, and polished death metal growls. For the album, Kaoru and Die utilized several guitar models and techniques; an unconventional method, some of the guitars were recorded directly from amps.
Music.
"Uroboros" is "stuffed with themes of 'guilt and reincarnation' as well as 'the past, present and future of Dir En Grey,'" as guitarist Kaoru stated in a press release. This was later echoed in CDJapan's album overview, calling the album "a sort of return for the band, revisiting the pre-"Withering to Death." era." Kaoru also included that the album would again be a progression into "heavier and darker" sounds than prior albums, as well as an "oriental and religious mood."
In an interview in the band's regular fan-club magazine, "Haiiro no Ginka", interviewer You Masuda described the style in comparison with the band's preceding album, "The Marrow of a Bone":
With the announcement of an American release date, guitarist Kaoru expressed further opinion on the album's style, saying the album would experiment with oriental sounds, and the "hard and heavy" atmosphere found on "The Marrow of a Bone" would be absent, instead favoring more elegant instrumentation and "something that lets you visualize several scenes".
Together with the band's label, a California-based radio station, Indie 103.1 premiered music from "Uroboros" on 19 October and 26 October, and will premier again on 2 November. The tracks "Red Soil" and "Dozing Green" were played on the first night, with "Glass Skin" chosen on the second, available both as a radio broadcast and internet radio show. On the 2 November broadcast, the band debuted "Gaika, Chinmoku ga Nemuru Koro".
During promotion, the track "Stuck Man" was referred to as "Third Time Does the Trick", however the title was changed before the final track listing was revealed.
In harmony with the Asian themes in the album, the first two tracks titles, "Sa Bir" and "Vinushka" are derived from the Tibetan language and Russian language respectively. The former referring to the movement of the Earth, while the latter is a "word from Russian origin" used "to talk about elements that are linked to sins," according to VerdamMnis Magazine's interview Kaoru did with French journalist Mandah Frénot. "Vinushka", which is a form of the word "vina", can be translated as "guilt".
Release.
A first time for the band, the album debuted in the United States, being released in four editions. The album is available via digital download, a standard CD, a deluxe limited edition release packaged in a cardboard sleeve and slipcase with both a CD and DVD, and finally in a twelve-inch LP with a card to download the digital release. The CD and DVD edition come with a series of live videos on the DVD, rather than making-of footage from the Japanese release. The live footage includes "Repetition of Hatred", "Agitated Screams of Maggots", and "Hydra -666-" from the band's Zepp Tokyo concert from 22 December 2007, "Dead Tree" from Wacken Open Air 2007, and "Dozing Green" from a show on Tour 07 The Marrow of a Bone; tracks one through four were all previously included on "In Weal or Woe".
The album was released in three editions in Japan; a standard edition, a limited edition and a deluxe edition. The standard edition includes no more than the main album, while the limited edition includes a bonus disc with unplugged tracks and internationally exclusive tracks. The deluxe edition contains both discs packaged with the limited edition, as well as a bonus DVD containing a documentary of the album's conception, and two LPs.
The original intent of the band's record label was to press an approximate amount of deluxe editions, however, due to extremely rapid sales and high demand, the edition was opened to a pre-order limit of August 16, after which no more copies were pressed and only leftover pressings are commercially available.
The European release, handled by Gan-Shin, began in France on November 12, simultaneously with the Japanese release. The album is available throughout Europe in two editions; the regular that includes only the album's feature tracks, while the limited edition includes three bonus tracks.
Reception.
"Uroboros" quickly received positive reviews, being acknowledged as an experimental album for the band, and a defined shift back to the band's roots, while retaining the metal elements of the recent works. Allmusic chose "Uroboros" as an "AMG Album Pick", praising the release for its variety and willingness to escape the band's stereotypes; Another oft mentioned aspect is the continued use of Japanese lyrics by Kyo, however, the album was also advertised with specific attention to the English revisions of "Dozing Green" and "Glass Skin", while other tracks also had heavy use of English. Several professional reviews have placed use of Japanese as something that will withhold the band from mainstream popularity, but some approve of the bands consistency with their native language. Negatives that reviewers have identified are repetition in the album's style, though this has also been interpreted as a strong point by JD Considine of "Revolver".
In its debut release week, the album sold 6,054 copies and reached number 114 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. This marks Dir En Grey's first time ranking on the United States' central music chart. In the band's native country, the album was met with high sales, exceeding thirty-seven thousand, which brought the album to a number four spot on the Oricon chart. This was Dir En Grey's best performance since "Kisou" (2002).

George Meegan

George Meegan (born 2 December 1952) is a British long-distance walker best known for his unbroken walk of the entire Western Hemisphere from the southern tip of South America to the northernmost part of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay. This journey on foot was of 19,019 miles (30,608 km) in 2,425 days (1977-1983) and is documented in his book "The Longest Walk" (1988). He has appeared often in the press including the "Today Show" three times, "CBS Morning News" and on "Larry King Live". Meegan lives Internationally and has a wife, Yoshiko, in Japan. They have two children. He ran as an Independent candidate for the Gillingham and Rainham constituency for the 2010 General Election.
Early life.
The day George was born, his mother, Pauline, was diagnosed at the same hospital with breast cancer. The hospital gave her the baby to carry, plus a bag of medicine (proving ineffective), and bus fare to get them back to a road caravan where she was living. Shortly thereafter, her husband left them, taking George’s milk ration with him. Pauline soon died of the cancer, and the baby (George) was found alive by a passing stranger.
George was taken in by Pauline’s older brother, Geoffrey Meegan, a former Royal Engineer, and Geoffrey’s wife, Frieda, who was an auxiliary nurse at Keycol Hill Hospital. Legally adopted at Rochester Court, Kent, at age three, George’s name was changed from Killingbeck to Meegan.
He grew up in Rainham, Kent, attending schools: Meredale, Wakeley Road, and Orchard Street. At 16, he signed on as a cadet aboard the T.S. Worcester, under the Thames Nautical Training College at Greenhithe. From there he went to sea in the Merchant Navy, first, on the MV Trecarne (1970), then the other tramp freighter Hain-Nourse, then a part of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O)—embarking on his long-envisioned life of ‘high adventure.’
Seafaring took him to more than 100 international ports of call, including Hong Kong, Bombay, Calcutta, Melbourne, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Antwerp, Dar es Salaam, and Mombasa. A crossing from Japan to Chile took over 30 days. A notable incident (during his anchorage off Lagos, Nigeria) in which Meegan played an important role—maintaining order aboard his ship, the Omar—is now called The Great Cement Scandal of 1975. Meegan’s career at sea spanned six-and-a-half years, serving in eleven ships. He finished in 1976 as Second Mate in navigation.
The Longest Walk.
In America, the ‘world walker’ was preceded in town-to-town media coverage signifying that, for many Americans, while in their country, Meegan had discovered the American Dream. In 1981, Jimmy Carter invited Meegan for a chat at the president’s Plains, Georgia, home. Later that year, Meegan reached Washington DC where "People magazine" greeted him. Friends and followers arranged several meetings with high government officials and dignitaries.
The crossing continued, through northern USA, Canada, into the Yukon, and on to the final step above the Arctic Circle. On the afternoon of 18 September 1983, he crossed a strip of tundra to the edge of the Arctic Ocean. There, he dipped his hand into the cold water. At the age 31, Meegan had walked 19,019 unbroken miles from end to end of two continents… and now faced the challenge of the rest of his life.
"Longest Walk" publication and publicity.
From the Arctic, he returned to his home in England. Meegan held a 600,000-word handwritten manuscript of the journey that he felt was invaluable to the world. all, George figured, the feat was an historic 'first crossing,' suggesting the era of European explorers. It also carried an inspirational calling to modern youth that it was still possible to 'live your dream.' After being turned down by the major houses in London, he took a job as a courier for DHL and flew to New York City aboard the Concorde.
Cold knocking there on door after door with a handful of news clippings proved unsuccessful, until he met the American war hero John Walker, who introduced George to Dodd, Mead and Company. Unfortunately, the 199-year-old firm, after a series of non-familial corporate ownerships, went bankrupt. So in 2008, he self-published "The Longest Walk: The Record of our World’s First Crossing of the Entire Americas" with Xlibris.
Following the Dodd, Mead publication, strong reviews led to appearances on the "Today Show", "CBS Morning News", and "Larry King Live". Meegan was invited back multiple times to various programs, and held dozens of TV and radio appearances, along with hundreds of worldwide lectures—colleges, Rotary clubs, The Explorers Club of New York, Sing Sing Prison, Ghana, Italy, Japan, and the RMS (Royal Mail Ship) Queen Elizabeth. He was listed as an inspirational speaker by "Sports Illustrated".
"People Magazine", having produced a four-page story on him in 1981, followed with a three-page feature after the 1983 finish. "People editor", John Drake, wrote that Meegan was the most unknown Bio person they ever did. photographer, Peter B. Kaplan, would go on to shoot world-famous pictures of the Statue of Liberty. Following the "People" publicity, "New Yorker", "Backpacker", Voice of America, Studs Terkel, various primetime TV interviews, and numerous newspaper articles from the "New York Times" to the "Washington Post" showcased the "witty, clean-cut globetrotter."
Having arrived in USA from Britain via fourteen countries, Meegan’s fascination with America grew during his millions of steps across it to Washington, D.C. Everyday citizens helped and cheered him. In frequent letters to notable politicians and public figures, Meegan extols the land’s open space, an innate drive of its people to achieve, and the availability of the American Dream to all. "It is the national ethos of a set of ideals found nowhere else he has walked," he said. "It includes the opportunity to prosper and succeed, and an upward social mobility achieved through hard work that is available to the common man like him, an orphan, school dropout who ran away to sea."
Back in England, the Royal Geographical Society made him a Fellow in 1983. Also in 1983 a newspaper competition for ‘The Best Legs in UK’ included Meegan. Other candidates were the Captain of England’s soccer team, winner of the Derby (the horse) flat race, and so on. World decathlon champion Daley Thompson won the competition, but Daley, during training from the LA 1984 Olympics, said, "George deserves it more." So the shield for 'Champion Legs of Great Britain' was presented to George by Ernest Saunders, Chairman of Guinness.
Meegan returned again to New York in 1988 for a promotion of the new release of "The Longest Walk" by Dobb, Mead. He also lectured in NYC and made other public appearances. One special occasion, 16 August 1988, at the Brooklyn end of the Brooklyn Bridge: borough president Howard Golden proclaimed George Meegan Day in Brooklyn with dancers and music. "Only in America may such a dream come true," said Meegan.
Alaska 2000.
In 2000, at age 47, and 17 years after completing the 19,019 mile Longest Walk, Meegan returned to the Arctic Circle and walked almost 500 kilometers farther northwest to reach Barrow, Alaska. This put a finishing touch on the hike at the northernmost land point of North America. The last 14 km leg of his walk in the cold blow at -83F wind chill from Barrow village to Point Barrow set his 8th Guinness record for the first crossing of the Americas by any other means (besides walking)—be it by road, ship, or aeroplane.
On 23 January 2001, of the new millennium, Meegan reached his goal — land’s end of North America — with about 100 Barrow villagers and adventurers from the world... including Lt. Col. Norman D. Vaughan, representing Mount Vaughan, Antarctica (named for him by Rear Admiral Richard Byrd). The purpose of the Alaska 2000 effort was to complete the hemispheric walk and to bring hope to the indigenous world by developing an alternative educational route whereby they could maintain their endangered culture, and yet be a part of a the 21st century, and to appeal to Uncle Sam not to block the option.
At this millennium event, in front of world media, the US government formally apologized to First Nations—the more than 600 Aboriginal peoples spread across Canada and Alaska who are neither Inuit nor Métis—in a public gesture unique in American history. "At Barrow on 1 January 2001, the US government via the White House and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) offered sincere apology for ‘the cowardly killing of woman and children’… and other atrocities spelled out in three-and-a-half pages read out loud." Legislators from both Houses of Alaska sent special personal acknowledgments as well.
The Alaska 2000 project also offered the US government a school alternative whereby—via an adjusted education—all Alaska’s First Nation cultures would be revived from extinction. The basis for this cultural/language preservation effort was a model program that Meegan had written up before Alaska 2000, which he named ‘Hope from the Land of the Polar Bear.’
The new program gave a route to save the threatened Aleut, Athabaskan, Inupiaq, Tlingit, Tsimshian and Yupik languages. The key, Meegan judged, was a culture-based curriculum. Teaching would be primarily in the indigenous languages, along with English (or Spanish, etc.), and accompanied by all necessary tools for successful living in the 21st century. His aim was to "to prevent language extinction".
His culture-based curriculum is also called Democracy Reaches the Kids, for which the US government awarded its highest endorsement, the E11 visa. Meegan accepted the E11, an honorary citizenship from Barrow, and left Alaska with the gift of 100-year-old sacred Eagle Feather. Also the lesson that, at root, modern schooling is acting as a ‘cultural destruction agent,’ which can be corrected by a ‘snowroots’ demonstration led by one person. Meegan left Barrow for Japan, England, and, currently, the indigenous children of the Ecuador Amazon.
Democracy Reaches the Kids.
In 2000, when Meegan moved after the Alaska 2000 from Barrow back to Japan, he reacclimatized to professorial duties and his family. He taught in the Kobe University department of Maritime Science and lectured frequently worldwide. He also began to piece together film footage of the Alaska 2000 to produce the documentary "Hope from the Land of the Polar Bear" (2002). It was shown at the New York Explorers Club Film Festival and lost to James Cameron. There is a copy in the Royal Geographical Society historic collection.
While educating he became educated, and began to weave the thoughts of things he had learned and accomplished in recent years into a text of school reform. "Democracy Reaches the Kids" was self-published in 2002 by Sirivatana Interprint of Bangkok. The two key elements of the text framework are a child’s health and a child’s culture—both original and adoptive. George, in the next decade, carried the slim book with him wherever he went in the hope that it might register with someone and see its revolutionary educational possibility.
As associate professor at Kobe (50) — enrollment 16,000 in 2013, 10% international—George taught students to be ships’ officers, and he lectured widely on maritime science on topics from shipboard English to navigation, in and out of Japan… and raised his family. From the university he led 45 students to Alaska in 2000, and then again in 2001. After 2002, Meegan moved about the world "with a purpose," but always returned to Japan and his students until 2011.
From these worldwide journeys emerged the principles of Democracy Reaches the Kids (DRTK)—beginning with the question, "What does each individual child, at the beginning of that great challenge and adventure we call life, need to be successful in the 21st century?" The aim is for education to encompass the whole world of the childhood experience, especially for those kids who do not fit in (like Meegan himself), with holistic education. Though "DRTK" was never put out for public sale, George distributed them continually while resupplying from the Bangkok publisher.
"DRTK" proposes that environment—both local and planetary—is the key in the battle of nature and nurture. The six-month pilot program for communities includes environment, culture, health, communication, computer, and social skills, plus a bit of money management. Then the distinguishing topics: talents, inspiration, activities, dreams… inherent to each child, which modern state schooling ignores or suppresses. Meegan suggests that the framework of DRTK enables the individual to soar beyond the nation, while creating an informed and caring citizenry.
Author Meegan’s articulates his vision and challenge for the 2010s as ‘pioneering the route whereby all our children can become the best they can be.’
"This goes beyond mere academics (whose second meaning is 'pointlessness'), and where the students are happier with real focus on what they see as naturally important. No more graffiti scarring. No more bullying. No more one in three kids heading for diabetes. Gifted kids getting there years before they would have otherwise. No more pressure from age 3 to… I suspect it would have nipped Columbine."
There have been many attempts throughout the history of education to improve the world, but George’s is aided by the aforementioned unique E11 (US Alien of Extraordinary Ability) visa—the only ever issued in child education, most commonly called ‘extraordinary capacity.’ The US government only grants the E11 if it establishes that a green card applicant is one of the very best in his field of endeavour.
Japan years.
As he mapped a route, he wrote about his plan to Yoshiko. She was unhappily employed in an office and trying to escape a prearranged marriage. She flew to London thinking George’s trip would be by bus, and was shocked to find it was to be on foot. Nevertheless, she joined Meegan on his first step from Tierra del Fuego in 1977 with nearly 20,000 miles to go to reach the arctic.
Since neither could speak the other’s language, they couldn’t hold a conversation during the walk. Just 300 yards and Yoshiko stopped, sat down on the mud strip road, and started to cry. He proclaimed, "Don’t worry, love, only another 19,000 miles to go!" Yoshiko changed her mind to continue when, shortly, an escaped convict pointed a revolver at her head. They escaped, and walked over three weeks to the Strait of Magellan, which separates Tierra del Fuego from the South American mainland.
Once across, George calculated they must cover 1,200 miles in three months or be marooned by the snows in the Argentine winter. Once on the mainland, they agreed that Yoshiko would hitchhike ahead across the desolate plateaus. Each night in the physical emptiness, she pitched camp, and waited, until nearing the tent in the dark, George would shine his tiny flashlight, and she hers, at each other. There was a happy reunion each night, and they fell in love all the way up to Alaska. Pausing in Mendoza, Argentina, they married.
By the completion of the Longest Walk in 1983, Yoshiko had birthed a son and daughter during timeouts in Japan, as George marched the unbroken route up the Americas. After the walk, they reunited in Toki, Gifu, where her parents lived. George taught English, like a lot of other foreigners do, until a full Professor at Kobe University in Maritime Science told George that because of his background at the ‘University of High Seas’, they were bringing him to Kobe, where he became an associate professor. George had left school at age 16, so it was the only degree he ever earned. It was the first ‘professor’ rank granted to a non-university graduate in Japan since the Meiji Revolution of 1859.
As the book "The Longest Walk" took off with readership around the world, during his 17 year tenure at Kobe, Japan took the lead. It was judged ‘inspirational’ and is included as a segment of the Japanese national high school curriculum. The adventure has been excerpted as an elective text for Japanese universities. The book is held at the USA Library of Congress, and he is pictured in the Guinness Book of World Records, Japan, Great Britain, and USA.
Kobe is the leading national university of maritime science in Japan. As the only Westerner on faculty on the maritime side of the grounds, Meegan, 5’ 10", 150 pounds and with blonde hair, stood out. He reported that the kids often told him he was the best teacher in their experience. At present, Japanese students go to study English in Portland or Disneyland. However, in George’s time he took them and students from other departments on major expeditions in the Alaska Labrador, and such places that were in his real situation. The most publicized was to the Alaska 2000 event—"the most significant international adventures from Kobe U since WWII."
One of the most enduring contributions to the MS department was the creation of an abridged version of the United Nation’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) benchmark Standard Marine Communication Phrases that was the bulky benchmark. His replacement title, "SHIPBOARD ENGLISH for Young Seafarers", was an important step in worldwide Maritime Education and Training. The original UN IMO is a 300 page tome of maritime expressions where, by comparison, Meegan’s abridged version is a more user friendly and pocket size booklet.
Meegan also authored the only example of the English language (International, Basic) that fits onto a single sheet of paper with type on both sides. It was called "The Kobe One Page Basic English Dictionary" and has 2,000 words, and was later published as "Basic English One Page" (VirtualBookWorm, 2013). He still uses the One-Page Dictionary during travels to teach English to non-speakers, handing it to hold rather than a seven pound Random House Webster’s Dictionary.
Throughout the 2000s, George taught, wrote, lectured, and made a documentary "Hope from the Land of the Polar Bear" (2002), and raised his children. During this time, Japan was awash in the phenomenon of Hikikomori, which literally means ‘shutting out the sun.’ BBC did a program "Japan: The Missing Millions" (2002) that describes millions of teenage boys in Japan's cities turning into hermits, and never leaving their rooms. Pressure from schools and an inability to talk to their families were the suggested causes. With his own children in the midst of peer pressure to withdraw, Meegan fought back with a written abstract titled "Hikikomori: New Approach of Hope" dealing with the country adolescents pulling inward by seeking extreme degrees of isolation.
He noted that Hikikomori is not just a condition of Japan, though in sheer numbers it leads, but is growing throughout the world. Similar problems are emerging in his own Great Britain and the Asian tigers of Hong Kong and South Korea. Then, in a follow-up paper "A Blueprint for a Way Forward," he summarized his solution. He would set up a program to harness the power of youth and youth dreams, to haul them out, step by step, from the darkness. The program would be a trajectory to educate, good citizenship, and a happier life. He spoke of the flattened lives being pulled up by the principles of Democracy Reaches the Kids. It is a simple alternative curriculum whereby the kids who don’t fit in are given a clear alternative route through education, and to success in society.
Both children grew up in Japan and became bilingual. Geoffrey left at thirteen to attend the famous alternative Summerhill School under head Zoe Readhead in Suffolk, England. The Summerhill philosophy embraced Meegan’s own that children learn best with freedom from concern and a strong voice in the classroom. Lessons are optional, and pupils are free to choose what to do with their time. The function of the school is to encourage a child to live his own life, rather than a life according to the purpose of an educator. Geoffrey also studied martial arts, was known for his sense of humor, and led his father’s 44 Japanese students in Barrow at the Alaska 2000.
Daughter Ayumi, which literally means ‘walking’ in Japanese, was a scholar, and liked jazz. After graduating high school in Kobe, she moved to San Francisco and performed jazz, traveling also to perform. She sang the Star Spangled Banner in front of 2000 folks, plus VIPs, at at the annual dinner and press conference for her father hosted by the Explorers at the NY Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
George Meegan’s position as Assistant Professor at the Japan Marine University in Kobe ended in 2011. There was a retirement ceremony and display of his photo record of eighteen years on faculty. The forty plus albums of his time are currently held at the Kobe University Archive. This has not been done for any faculty member before or since, and Meegan attributes the honor to the special activities he did with students at and away from campus. The sweeping record promotes him, as well as the university. 
Free from teaching, Meegan sought a change from the safe urban geographic and Cultural Landscapes of Japan. While his family stayed on in Japan, and later England, George set off, as ever, for new horizons. The first stop was Bethel, Alaska. Bethel, in central Alaska, 400 miles west of Anchorage has access only by air and the Kuskokwim River. It is the main port and transportation hub for 58 villages on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
Ten years earlier, in 1990, George and son Geoffrey had slept behind the couch of an old friend in Barrow named Rex Wilhelm who had since become president of the historic Alaska Commercial. George told Mr. Wilhelm about the destruction of the Eyak culture, and how he could stop it and other such tragedies. Wilhelm immediately suggested Bethel. He gave George a job as a shoe clerk ‘grade 3’ at his Bethel shoe store from Christmas 2011 to Christmas 2012 that paid him to reach Ecuador in early 2013 and attempt to launch Operation Safeguard to save the indigenous languages of Amazonia.
He left with a deep regard for Bethel community which he calls the capital of Yupik America. He has many friends, and claims they always return there to be among the friendliest people he has met in the world. It was in Bethel, in 2012, while in good health, that he selected his burial plot. This came about when Mike Calvetti, commander of the Bethel VFW, was shown Meegan’s Merchant Navy (UK) Association service medal, allowing him as a member of a VFW sister organization to be buried in the cemetery with Bethel villagers.
Politics.
"All a wonderful adventure; and yes, I stood in the General Election for where I grew-up as a boy! As I only had a week to campaign, beforehand, I specially set-up a YouTube presence, some three dozen clips for the connected generation. Right from the start, there was a bit more of a buzz whenever this unlikely candidate spoke. ‘MEEGAN’ was printed on the ballot paper, right next to a symbol of Rochester castle. Of course, I had no chance of winning. I was going head-head with all of England's political machines."
"Gillingham & Rainham is a key marginal, and right from Day One, the prime minister was there, pacing edgily up and down Gillingham Station. His candidate was Paul Clark, a Labour Party minister. The thuggish BNP (British National Party) were there too; I asked them to join me. ‘Walk with the angels,’ I said. On a borrowed bike, I had cycled 180-miles and in the process spoke to over 4,000 people. Courtesy of Royal Mail, my poster was delivered free of charge into each of the 41,000 households that make up the constituency. On the final day (5 May), I blitzed a marathon by visiting each of our 35 polling stations There, I saluted the election staffs; ‘On behalf of all the candidates,’ I announced. ‘Thank you for your long day and your support of Democracy, and indeed your celebration of Freedom.’
"I was liable alone in all GB in doing this salute. All this relentless activity from dawn to dusk lifted the voter turnout to near 63%. Wonderful! Alone among candidates 109 votes were counted in the big hall. ‘All friends,’ I was told. ‘Your spirit shines through, George,’ said the former mayor of Medway. What an incredible blast it all was. A great honour in my life! The way to defend UK culture is not xenophobia, but adjust the educational system to protect it. What a lot of fun! My slogan was- If we do not lean toward our children's talent, and their dreams, they will lean toward our... nightmares."
He got involved in UK politics after observing what had happened with his own kids growing up in Japan and UK. One day in Japan, Meegan’s boy, Geoffrey, was in tears because the school was telling him "how bad he was." So, his father resolved to find a way so that all students could be happy and proud for whom they are. He imagined a world where all children could have their uniqueness, and what they can do be celebrated, rather than being judged and life blighted by what they cannot do. Democracy equals no more children made unhappy by school, ever. He wrote, "This is what I fight for every single day of my life remaining."
Meegan’s roll into politics started in the northernmost cabin in the USA at Helmericks, on the Colville River (Alaska). He took Geoffrey there in 1990, away from the constrained Japanese classrooms, for a fresh perspective on life. Helmericks is a family homestead village, and the two Meegans increased the town population for by 30% from 6 to 8 people during a one month stay. His son helped Meegan organize the notes for "Democracy Reaches the Kids", and the book was published later that year. One of its earliest supporters was celebrated NY teacher John Taylor Gatto, who used notes from Meegan’s book and carried them protected in laminations with him during his lecture days.
As for politics, Meegan believes that education shouldn't actually have any connection with politics, as would be with democracy kids. In democratic classrooms that would be the case. Each kid would have a framework, as President Clinton said, "to become the best that they can be." Letter canvassing to the general public followed the book publication, and especially to select dignitaries. In a letter to the public titled "Democracy Reaches the Kids!" (2009), the author outlined his plan to Save the Children, and therefore to change the planet:
“My vision is to gather together kids who have been lost to education and use this bottom level group, one of whom none in education can doubt that they have ‘failed.’ Bring them back. Use their natural enthusiasm, largely lost in modern education. All will be filmed and recorded to make the worldwide model. Local media will be sought to ensure the community are involved, fully appraised.
“Education today has become a process that is consumed in testing, grading, etc. And even that is on a narrow range of subjects that have no traction what-so-ever to an angry, dangerous youth. The essence of Democracy Reaches the Kids measures and judges what a youth can do; not block and in effect destroy that youth by what he cannot do... There are a group of children in Great Britain who are called Refusers. You are not alone. In Japan some estimates say nearly one million, as you refuse."
Meegan’s personal letters to public figures to drum up support for educational reform were buttressed by facts, dusted with Shakespearean charm, and always accompanied by a ‘cheerio’ goodbye. He wrote in a 2011 campaign letter to US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords: "USA: best miracle medicine in the whole wide world. Bravo America!" In another letter to Captain Mark Kelly USN, Astronaut, he proudly featured his E11 visa, "I have been judged at the highest US peer review level, and my deep regard of America is well known."
Present.
The search for a site in 2013 targeted the Amazonia mountain village of Puyo, the capital of Pastaza Province. In June, 2013, Meegan flew from his annual swing in the USA (to sanction the E11 visa), and on to the Ecuador capital of Quito. He saw a color picture in the Visiones newspaper of a Waorani with seven spears pushed through him. Studying the photo and reading the report, Meegan thought that these people needed his help. The story was heralded as Puyo, so there he went on a five hour bus to the jungled mountainside town of 27,000, including many Waorani tribe.
The Waorani or Huaorani, also known as the Waos, are Native Americans of the Amazonian who have marked differences, such as language, culture, and a deep identification with the Jaguar, from other ethnic groups from Ecuador. In the last 40 years, they have shifted from a hunting and gathering society to live mostly in permanent forest settlements such as Puyo. to myth, the Waorani are the descendants of a mating between a jaguar and an eagle. In their belief system, a jaguar shaman is able ‘to become’ a jaguar.
The store of botanical knowledge among the tribe is extensive, ranging from poisons to hallucinogens. In 1956, a group of five American missionaries made contact with the Huaorani in what was known as Operation Auca, in which they lowered gifts in a basket from a plane to initiate friendly contact. Two days later, all five of the missionaries were killed in a Huaorani spearing raid. Meegan, aware of the precedent spearing where he was going, was more alarmed by the nation’s bureaucratic indecision. Despite Quito media reports of other alleged Huaorani attacks, Meegan made his visit.
Meegan calls his pilot program Operation Safeguard: Hope to the Indigenous Tribes of Amazonia. On arrival in Puyo, he arranged meetings among the tribe and on 6 June 2013, presented a lecture called "Stealing the Fire" to the Quito Ministry of Higher Education. It was applauded and put him into the familiar Ecuador ‘slow roll’ of bureaucratic promises with delays. Then, on 17 September 2013, in a speech titled "Save the Indigenous Children of Ecuador" to Puyo teachers and Waorani, he explained that the Constitution of Ecuador "Guarantees the Nationalities of the indigenous tribes, however the education policy (as is common throughout the world) cannot support that guarantee."
The aim in Puyo is to better the world through the children, primarily by preserving their indigenous languages and teaching them the lessons for living in modern times. This is designed after a successful model he set up in Barrow following the Alaska 2000 event and subsequent US government aid. Operation Safeguard in Ecuador is based on what he calls Preventable Language Extinction. In Alaska, after the 2008 loss of Eyak when the last native speaker died, no action had yet been taken to check this fast approaching extinction of several other Alaska First Nation languages.
With a similar threat among the Amazonian tribes, Meegan suggests that the only thing left to stem the demise of the tribes is a shift to a culture based curriculum. The foundation of culture is languages, and these would be defended in courses taught in the native tongues. Other classroom focuses would include environment, social, computer, Spanish, and requirements for modern living. The syllabus is outlined in "Democracy Reaches the Kids".
At age 14, Meegan’s son, Geoffrey, and his sister set out to walk across India from Bombay to Madras. During the 5-month trip, Ayumi became friends with Mother Teresa. She wrote Santa Pont’a Journey (2009) in English and Japanese about a young boy who embarks on foot in search to find God. In 2013, in London, Geoffrey was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, and currently lives in London with the help of his family. Meegan, in Ecuador, awaits a decision from the Ministry of Education so to begin his work among the peoples he first met 35 years before. It seems The Longest Walk is not finished after all.

Hero (1985 film)

Hero is 1985 a Pakistani Urdu colour film starring Waheed Murad, Babra Sharif, Mumtaz, Aslam Pervaiz, Saqi, Adil Murad (as child star & guest star) and Nadeem (as guest star). It was produced by Waheed himself and directed by his close friend Iqbal Yousuf. Waheed Murad died leaving this film incomplete. It was later completed by Iqbal Yousuf using 'cheat shot' techniques and released after two years of Waheed's death on 11 January 1985 countrywide.
In those days, Waheed Murad was in trouble and was being cast in either supporting roles or being offered by 'B-class' film directors. So he decided to produce his own film and chosen his best friend Iqbal Yousuf as film director. The script and story was written by Waheed himself. Waheed's expectations were high for this film, as he once said in an interview in Anwar Maqsood's programme 'Silver Jubilee':
Synopsis.
"Hero" is a romantic and action movie. Waheed Murad played double role in this film. It is based on a story of two different persons but with similar faces, one is very innocent and the other is a gangster.
Release.
"Hero" was released on 11 January 1985, i.e., after two years of Waheed Murad's death. The film was released on Lyric Cinema of Karachi and Firdous Cinema of Hyderabad. The film had average success and completed 35 weeks on cinemas with 5 weeks on main cinemas and thus became a Silver Jubilee film.
Filming.
During those days, Waheed Murad was depressed, frustrated and suffered from his illness. He had to undergo for a stomach removal surgery. After surgery, he recovered, but lost significant amount of weight, which could be seen in "Hero". Babra Sharif revealed that during filming of a scene of "Hero", Waheed lost his balance while walking briskly toward her and fell down. He took several minutes to catch his breath prior to standing up on his feet again. In July 1983, Waheed also had a car accident, which left a large scar on his face. He moved to Karachi to get the scar fixed (plastic surgery) in order to complete the last few scenes of "Hero", but died one day before his surgery.
Music.
The music of the film was composed by M. Ashraf with Tasleem Fazli and Khwaja Pervaiz as lyricist. Ahmed Rushdi, Noor Jehan, Mehdi Hassan and Mehnaz were the lead singers. The songs are:

Mexican miracle

The Mexican miracle refers to the country's inward-looking development strategy that produced sustained economic growth of 3 to 4 percent and modest 3 percent inflation annually from the 1940s until the 1970s.
Mexican miracle.
Background.
This growth was sustained by the government's increasing commitment to primary education for the general population from the late 1920s through the 1940s. The enrollment rates of the country's youth increased threefold during this period; consequently when this generation was employed by the 1940s their economic output was more productive. 
Additionally, the government fostered the development of consumer goods industries directed toward domestic markets by imposing high protective tariffs and other barriers to imports. The share of imports subject to licensing requirements rose from 28 percent in 1956 to an average of more than 60 percent during the 1960s and about 70 percent in the 1970s. Industry accounted for 22 percent of total output in 1950, 24 percent in 1960, and 29 percent in 1970. The share of total output arising from agriculture and other primary activities declined during the same period, while services stayed constant.
The government promoted industrial expansion through public investment in agricultural, energy, and transportation infrastructure. Cities grew rapidly during these years, reflecting the shift of employment from agriculture to industry and services. The urban population increased at a high rate after 1940 (see Urban Society, ch. 2). Growth of the urban labor force exceeded even the growth rate of industrial employment, with surplus workers taking low-paying service jobs.
Import-substitution program.
In the years following World War II, President Miguel Alemán Valdés's (1946–52) full-scale import-substitution program stimulated output by boosting internal demand. The government raised import controls on consumer goods but relaxed them on capital goods, which it purchased with international reserves accumulated during the war. The government spent it heavily on infrastructure. By 1950 Mexico's road network had expanded to 21,000 kilometers, of which some 13,600 were paved.
Economic performance.
Mexico's strong economic performance continued into the 1960s, when GDP growth averaged about 7 percent overall and about 3 percent per capita. Consumer price inflation averaged only 3 percent annually. Manufacturing remained the country's dominant growth sector, expanding 7 percent annually and attracting considerable foreign investment. 
Mining grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent, trade at 6 percent, and agriculture at 3 percent. By 1970 Mexico had diversified its export base and become largely self-sufficient in food crops, steel, and most consumer goods. Although its imports remained high, most were capital goods used to expand domestic production.

Unattended ground sensor

The unattended ground sensor (UGS) is under development as part of the United States Army's Future Combat Systems Program. For information on currently fielded UGS systems, refer to the Current Force UGS Program or CF UGS.
The CF UGS systems employ various sensor modalities including seismic, acoustic, magnetic, and pyroelectric transducers, daylight imagers and passive infrared imagers to automatically detect the presence of persons or vehicles, and transmit activity reports or imagery via radio-frequency (RF) or satellite communications (SATCOM) links to a remote processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) station. The systems are packaged for concealed emplacement in the field and for long-duration unattended operation.
The CF UGS program includes a family of sensors from various companies: Qual-Tron Inc (MIDS, EMIDS, MMIDS) E-UGS, Silent Watch, Falcon Watch, Scorpion, OmniSense and OmniSense-Enhanced. The current sources for CF UGS are Applied Research Associates (E-UGS), Harris Corporation (Silent Watch, Falcon Watch), Northrop Grumman-Xetron (Scorpion), McQ Inc (OmniSense, OmniSense-Enhanced).
Future combat systems UGS.
There are two types of unattended ground sensors that are being fielded under the United States Army's Future Combat Systems Program, the Urban UGS or U-UGS and the Tactical UGS or T-UGS. The current generation is manufactured by Textron Defense Systems a subcontractor under Boeing.
Tactical unattended ground sensor.
T-UGS are small ground-based sensors that collect intelligence through seismic, acoustic, radiological nuclear and electro-optic means. These sensors are networked devices that provide an early warning system to supplement a platoon size element and are capable of remote operation. To an extent T-UGS will detect, track, classify, and identify personnel and vehicles within its coverage area and report to the FCS Network in near real-time.
T-UGS comprises the following sensor systems:
Urban unattended ground sensor.
For urban areas, the urban-unattended ground sensor (U-UGS) is used as a surveillance tool during building clearing operations, and in caves, sewers, tunnels, and other confined spaces. Textron Defense Systems, along with Honeywell, designed these wireless, hand emplaced system of sensors to be lightweight and low cost. The U-UGS network is capable of taking field-of-view images of intruders in all light conditions and transmits images to the FCS Network where immediate recognition of human intruders should be achieved or by using the motion detecter sensors only when imaging is not needed, only motion detection
The proposed U-UGS sensors are made up of the following:

Robert Byington Mitchell

Robert Byington Mitchell (April 4, 1823January 26, 1882) was a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War and the Governor of the New Mexico Territory from 1866 to 1869.
Early life and career.
Mitchell was born on April 4, 1823, in Mansfield, Ohio. For some odd reason, it was recorded that he graduated from both Kenyon College and Washington College, although neither school has a record of his attendance.
He studied law in Mount Vernon, Ohio. After completing his studies, he practiced law in Mansfield. He served in the Mexican War as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Ohio Volunteers. He was elected mayor of Mount Gilead, Ohio, in 1855. Next year, he moved to Linn County, Kansas Territory. He served in the territorial legislature, as a delegate to the Leavenworth Convention, from 1857 to 1858. He served as treasurer of the Kansas Territory from 1859 to 1861. He was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina.
Civil War service.
After the start of the Civil War, Mitchell served as the Adjutant General of Kansas from May 2, 1861 to June 20, 1861. He later led the 2nd Kansas Infantry. He was badly wounded at the Battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861. He was shot from his horse while leading his regiment.
After recovery, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln appointed him as a brigadier general to rank from April 8, 1862, and he was given command of a mixed brigade at Fort Riley. He commanded the 9th Division in Charles C. Gilbert's III Corps at the Battle of Perryville. He was then sent to Nashville, Tennessee, where he remained for several months.
During the Chickamauga campaign, Mitchell served as George H. Thomas's Chief of Cavalry for the Army of the Cumberland. Just before the Third Battle of Chattanooga, he was ordered to Washington, D.C., for court-martial duty. According to some sources, this was due to severe wounds which incapacitated him from field duty but this is contradicted in the "Official Records" by Mitchell's own correspondence. Whether incapacitated or not, he would not see active campaigning again, and for the remainder of the Civil War, he commanded the District of Nebraska, then the District of North Kansas, and finally the District of Kansas. He saw service in Colorado Territory in January, 1865, following the Indian raid on Julesburg, Colorado on the Overland Trail, but did not succeed in locating the Indian camp on the Republican River until after they had departed.
Governor of New Mexico Territory.
Mitchell was honorably mustered out of the army on January 15, 1866. On the same day, the United States Senate confirmed his nomination as the Governor of the New Mexico Territory. He took the oath of office on June 6, 1866. He never appeared to take his duties as governor seriously. He often was absent from the territorial capital Sante Fe, without explanation, forcing the legislature to forward bills it had passed to Washington, D. C., for approval of the United States Congress. He resigned as governor in 1869.
Later life.
After leaving the office, Mitchell returned to Kansas. He was unsuccessful in his bid to represent Kansas in the U.S. Congress in 1872. He then moved to Washington, D. C., where he died on January 26, 1882. He was buried with full military honors in Section 2, Grave 1023, of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

J. Clyde Morris

J. Clyde Morris was a civic leader in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia. His career spanned 32 years of public service. 
Morris served as the only city manager of the short-lived City of Warwick in the Virginia Peninsula subregion from 1952 to 1958. This was an important and change-filled period for the former Warwick County, one of the original shires of Virginia originally established in 1634. In 1952, Warwick made the transition to become an independent city. Then, in 1958, it was consolidated with neighboring City of Newport News, which had become separate from the county after development of the coal piers and the eastern terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and the massive facilities of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company by developer and industrialist Collis P. Huntington. 
Morris next undertook leadership of the entities which funded, built and operate the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, completed in 1964. He was the first executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel District. He was also a member of the Hampton Roads Sanitation District Commission for 32 years. 
In Newport News, a stretch of U.S. Route 17 from the York County border (to where it turns left onto Jefferson Avenue) then straight through to Warwick Boulevard was named J. Clyde Morris Boulevard in his honor by the Warwick City Council in 1958.

Fruitvale Oil Field

The Fruitvale Oil Field is a large oil and gas field in the southern San Joaquin Valley, California, within and just northwest of the city of Bakersfield, along and north of the Kern River. It is one of the few oil fields in the California Central Valley which is mostly surrounded by a heavily populated area. Discovered in 1928, and with a cumulative total recovery of more than of oil at the end of 2006, it is 41st in size among California oil fields, and according to the California Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) its total reserve amounts to a little less than ten percent of its original oil.
Setting.
Unlike most of the large Kern County oil fields, which are in the hills bordering the Central Valley, the Fruitvale field is on the valley floor, surrounded by the city of Bakersfield and its suburbs. The southern San Joaquin Valley in the vicinity of the oil field, except where cut by the Kern River and where artificially modified by features such as canals, is almost as flat as a table top, and the elevation of field varies only from about 370 to 400 feet (110 to 120 meters) across its extent.
The climate is arid, with hot summers and mild winters. Temperature in the summer commonly exceeds . Only about 5 to of precipitation falls in a year, almost invariably as rain, and in the winter. Tule fog is common during the cooler months. Drainage is to the Kern River which flows southwest through the southern part of the field towards the Buena Vista Lake Bed.
While the native vegetation in the area is mostly allscale and needlegrass, most vegetation has been removed from the area of active operations, and formerly active areas have largely been converted to industrial or other urban uses. Much of the northern part of the field, no longer used for production, is covered with residential development, as is the extreme south part, south of the Kern River. In the northwestern area of the field, the Calloway Area, a decommissioned part of the field has been turned into a golf course. Riparian vegetation and associated wildlife habitats can be found along the Kern River, which crosses through the southern part of the field.
Since the oil field is in an urbanized area, it is easily accessible from all sides. California State Route 99, a freeway, runs along and through the east side of the field, and the Rosedale Highway, Route 58 runs across it from east to west. Calloway Drive runs approximately along the western boundary, and Coffee Road parallels Calloway Drive to the east, crossing through the entire field.
Geology.
The Fruitvale Field is in a sedimentary basin in which the beds dip slightly to the west. The topmost sedimentary unit, the Kern River Formation, is young – of Pleistocene age – and not oil-bearing. Underneath this alluvial layer, which is over thick, and over millions of years, oil has collected in a series of structural traps, typically where an oil-bearing unit is topped by an impermeable one, and blocked up-dip by another impermeable structure placed there by faulting. The most productive geologic formations, from top to bottom, include the Pliocene Etchegoin Formation, Pliocene-Miocene Chanac Formation, the Miocene 42-O Sand, and the Miocene Santa Margarita Formation. Many of these formations are productive oil-bearing units elsewhere in the Central Valley, for their geographic coverage is wide, and many structural and stratigraphic trap types exist throughout the province.
The field is divided conventionally into two significant areas: the large Main Area on the east and south, and the much smaller Calloway Area on the northwest. At the west edge of the field is the small and abandoned Greenacres Area, which was marginally productive, between 1953 and 1969.
A total of five oil pools are distinguished within the Main Area. In order of discovery, they are the Mason-Parker, Martin, and Kernco (all February 1928), Santa Margarita (December 1929), and Fairhaven (March 1936). Oil is found at depths ranging from 3,000 to . In the Calloway Area, two pools are identified but production data is commingled; they are named for their petroleum-bearing unit, the 42-0/42-7 Sand. This area was not discovered until 1957.
Signal Oil & Gas Co. drilled the deepest well in the field, reaching a depth of , and encountering the granitic basement rocks, probably of Jurassic age.
History, production and operations.
The first well drilled in the area to find oil was by Pacific Eastern Production Company (later Gulf Oil) which reached oil in February 1928, and attained a total initial depth of . A few months after completion, the same well was recompleted to a depth of ; however, nothing significantly more productive was found at this depth. 
Several enhanced recovery techniques have been used in the Fruitvale Field. In 1972, operators began waterflooding, thereby attempting to push the heavy crude to production wells, increasing the rate of extraction; in 1976, they began using cyclic steam flooding, a generally more effective technique for heavy oil, as the heat considerably reduces the oil's viscosity, helping it to flow. Fireflooding, an enhanced recovery technology in which flammable units deep underground are ignited—in this case, a thick section of oil sand—began in 1980 in the portion of the field operated by Gulf. Engineers at the time believed that up to 400 million further barrels of oil could be recovered from the field, oil which could be made to flow due to the intense heat generated by this process.
In 2008, well operators on the field included none of the major oil companies. The largest operators were independents such as Summit Energy, Big West of California, San Joaquin Facilities Management, E & B Natural Resources, Sunray Petroleum, Black Gold Oil Co., and others. A total of 301 wells remained in production, and 65 were used for injection of various kinds (including steam and wastewater).
The most productive year for the field as a whole was 1954, during which were extracted. Production has generally declined since, although it leveled off around 1986, with approximately 400,000 to pumped each year since then.

Avenue Verte

The Avenue Verte/Greenway is a joint Anglo-French initiative assisted by Europe, to develop a largely traffic-free route between Paris and London (via the Dieppe – Newhaven ferry) for cyclists, walkers and horse riders. A route was put in place in time for the 2012 London Olympic Games. The route is not yet finalised and several sections are noted on the Avenue Verte website as being temporary. 
England.
In England, the route would follow the National Cycle Network (NCN) Route 21 between London and the South Coast. In East Sussex, the Avenue Verte incorporates existing paths including the Cuckoo Trail and Forest Way, offering more than 30 km of traffic-free cycling, walking and horse riding along former railway lines.
The route would continue to Newhaven as NCN Route 2, along the South Coast, into West Sussex to the West and Kent to the East.
North of East Sussex, the route would follow NCN 21 through West Sussex, Surrey and into London. Here, the route would pass through several boroughs before ending at St Paul's Cathedral.
The majority of the route on the English side is unpaved and in parts in so poor condition that it is not suitable for roadbikes, instead a hybrid or MTB is recommended.
France.
In France, the Avenue Verte follows the former Dieppe to Paris railway for 40 km. It currently starts just outside Dieppe at Arques-la-Bataille and stops again just outside Forges-les-Eaux but once complete, the route will extend to Paris almost entirely on traffic-free routes.
Directions: Leaving the ferry terminal at Dieppe, head towards the town centre. At the harbour bridge you will see signs for Avenue Verte and D1.

Que sais-je?

“Que sais-je?” (literally "What do I know?") is a series of books published by the Presses universitaires de France (PUF). The aim of the series is to provide the lay reader with an accessible introduction to a field of study written by an expert in the field. As such, they are a good example of "haute vulgarisation" (high popularization). The sentence "Que sais-je?" is taken from the works of French essayist Michel de Montaigne. 
Begun in 1941 by Paul Angoulevent (1899-1976), founder of the Presses Universitaires de France, the series now numbers over 3,900 titles by more than 2,500 authors, and translated in more than 43 languages. Somes titles have sold more than 300,000 copies (namely by Piaget). Each year, 50 to 60 new titles are added to the collection, which comprises ten different series. As such, it easily constitutes the world's largest running 'encyclopedia' in paperback format. The range of subjects is truly encyclopedic, covering everything from "chanson de geste" and Homer to gastronomy and free will. Not all subjects are academic—they may include current topics, such as violence in sports or personal coaching. The presentation of information is varied and may consist of an introduction to a subject, a detailed essay on a school of thought, or an analysis of current events. Up to 2004, more than 160 millions copies had been sold worldwide.
The series is unusual in several ways: first, the price for each volume is the same and is kept to a minimum (€9 as of mid-2011), and each book has 128 pages.
When a title has become out of date, it may be withdrawn from the series or it may be updated. Sometimes this updating involves a complete re-writing of the book, as for example "Parfumerie" (volume 1888): originally written by Edmond Roudnitska in 1980 and re-written by Jean-Claude Ellena in 2006, but keeping the same number within the series.
The series is similar to other series such as Collection 128 published by Armand Colin in France, the Very Short Introductions published by Oxford University Press and C.H. Beck Wissen published by Verlag C.H. Beck.

Taking Woodstock

Taking Woodstock is a 2009 American comedy-drama film about the Woodstock Festival of 1969, directed by Ang Lee. The screenplay by James Schamus is based on the memoir "Taking Woodstock: A True Story of a Riot, a Concert, and a Life" by Elliot Tiber and Tom Monte.
The film premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, and opened in New York and Los Angeles on August 26, 2009, before its wide theatrical release two days later.
Plot.
Set in 1969, the film follows the true story of Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin), an aspiring Greenwich Village interior designer whose parents, Jake (Henry Goodman) and Sonia (Imelda Staunton), own the small dilapidated El Monaco Motel in White Lake, in the town of Bethel, New York. A hippie theater troupe, The Earthlight Players, rents the barn, but can hardly pay any rent. Due to financial trouble, the motel may have to be closed, but Elliot pleads with the local bank not to foreclose on the mortgage and Sonia delivers a tirade about her struggles as a Russian refugee. The family is given until the end of the summer to pay up.
Elliot plans to hold a small musical festival, and has, for $1, obtained a permit from the town's chamber of commerce (of which he is also the president). When he hears that the organizers of the Woodstock Festival face opposition against the originally planned location, he offers his permit and the motel accommodations to organizer Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff). A neighbor, Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), provides his nearby farm land; first they agree on a fee of $5,000, but after realizing how many people will come, Yasgur demands $75,000, which the organizers reluctantly accept. Elliot comes to agreement about the fee for the motel more smoothly. Initial objections by his mother quickly disappear when she sees the cash paid in advance.
Elliot and Yasgur encounter a little bit of expected opposition. The local diner refuses to serve Elliot anymore, inspectors target the motel (and only his) for building code violations, and some local boys paint a swastika and hate words on the hotel. However, resistance quickly dissolves in the tidal wave of peace and love (and commerce) brought to the area. The Tiber family works hard serving the massive influx of visitors and become wealthy in the process. A cross-dressing veteran, Vilma (Liev Schreiber), is hired as a security guard. Elliot also struggles with hiding his homosexuality from his family, when he connects romantically with one of the event organizers staying at the motel.
On the first day of the concert, Elliot, his father, and Vilma hear the music begin in the distance. Elliot's father, transformed and enlivened by all the new life in town, tells Elliot to go and see the concert. Elliot hitches a ride through the peaceful traffic jam on the back of a benevolent state trooper's motorcycle and arrives at the event. There, he meets a hippie couple (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner), who invite him to join them on an LSD trip in their VW Bus a short distance from the crowd. Elliot has trouble relaxing at first, but gradually melts into a psychedelic union with them. When they finally emerge after sundown, Elliot watches the vast crowd and brilliant lights of the distant concert ripple with harmonious hallucinatory visuals that swell into serene white light.
Elliot returns home from his liberating experience and has breakfast with his parents. He suggests to his mother that they now have enough money to replace him, but she cannot bear to let him have his freedom. Elliot storms out, facetiously suggesting his mom eat the hash brownies Vilma has just offered. After another beautiful day at the festival, during which his friend the Vietnam veteran, Billy (Emile Hirsch), appears to overcome his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Elliot returns home to find his parents laughing and cavorting hysterically, having eaten Vilma's hash brownies. The once-brittle family (particularly Sonia) are united in joy and delirious affection.
The next morning, however, Sonia inadvertently reveals that she has secretly saved $97,000 in cash in the floorboards of her closet. Elliot is upset that his mother hid this from him while he put his own savings into helping his parents.
After the final day of the concert, Elliot packs up his life and says farewell to his father, after his father encourages him to strike out on his own. As Elliot pays one last visit to the concert and looks out over the muddy desolation of the Yasgur farm, Lang rides up on horseback and they marvel at how despite the obstacles, the event was a success. Lang mentions his next big project: staging a truly free concert in San Francisco with the Rolling Stones – the infamous Altamont Free Concert.
Production.
Filming took place from August–October 2008 in New Lebanon, New York and East Chatham, New York, located in Columbia County, and New York City.
Factual accuracy.
Michael Lang has disputed Tiber's account of the initial meeting with Max Yasgur, and said that he was introduced to Yasgur by a real estate salesman. Lang says that the salesman drove him, without Tiber, to Yasgur's farm. Sam Yasgur, son of Max, agrees with Lang's version, and says that his mother, who is still alive, says Max did not know Tiber. Artie Kornfeld, a Woodstock organizer, has said he found out about Yasgur’s farm from his own sources.
Release and reception.
Critical reaction.
The film maintains a 48% average on Rotten Tomatoes and a 55% on Metacritic.
Roger Ebert at the "Chicago Sun-Times" wrote, "[...] Lee and writer James Schamus aren’t making a historical pastiche. This is a comedy with some sweet interludes and others that are cheerfully over the top, such as a nude theatrical troupe living in Elliot’s barn, and Vilma, his volunteer head of motel security, a transvestite ex-Marine played by Liev Schreiber. How does Schreiber, looking just as he usually does except for a blond wig and a dress, play a transvestite? Completely straight. It works."
Michael Phillips at the "Chicago Tribune" gave it 3 out 4 stars saying
"Screenwriter James Schamus doesn’t do anything as stupid as shove Elliot back in the closet, but this is no “Brokeback Catskills Mountain.” It’s a mosaic—many characters, drifting in and out of focus—stitching the story of how the peace-and-music bash fell together as it bounced in the haphazard planning stages from its originally scheduled Wallkill, N.Y., location to a cow pasture in White Lake. (Eugene Levy, working hard to restrain his natural comic ebullience, plays the dairy farmer, Max Yasgur.)
Stephen Holden at the "New York Times" wrote, ""Taking Woodstock" pointedly shies away from spectacle, the better to focus on how the lives of individuals caught up by history are transformed...the movie explicitly connects Woodstock to the gay-liberation movement and the Stonewall riots, which took place two months earlier that summer.
Lou Lumeneck at the "New York Post" gave it 1.5 stars. "It turns the fabled music festival, a key cultural moment of the late 20th century, into an exceedingly lame, heavily clichéd, thumb-sucking bore. There are two main problems with "Taking Woodstock." One is the central nonperformance by the stand-up comedian Demetri Martin, who is pretty much an emotional black hole as Elliot...the movie doesn't make much of an issue of the character's gayness—which is utterly untrue to the period, 1969, even in enlightened circles."
Melissa Anderson in the "Village Voice" wrote, "Ang Lee’s facile "Taking Woodstock" proves that the decade is still prone to the laziest, wide-eyed oversimplifications...little music from the concert itself is heard. On display instead are inane, occasionally borderline offensive portrayals of Jews, performance artists, trannies, Vietnam vets, squares, and freaks.
"Slate" wrote, "After the long middle section building up to the actual Woodstock, the movie's treatment of the event is maddeningly indirect. No one's asking for a song-by-song re-enactment of the concert, but Lee's refusal to focus even for a moment on the musical aspect of the festival starts to feel almost perverse, as if he's deliberately frustrating the audience's desire."
Box office.
"Taking Woodstock" grossed $3,457,760 during its opening weekend, opening at #9. After five and a half weeks in theaters, on October 1, 2009, the film's total worldwide box office gross was $8,695,829.
Awards and nominations.
"Taking Woodstock" was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for "Outstanding Film – Wide Release" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.
Home release.
The DVD and Blu-ray were released on December 15, 2009.

Macro analysis

In music theory, macro analysis is a method of transcribing, or writing down chords that may be used along with or instead of conventional musical analysis. Uppercase or lowercase letters are used to indicate the roots of chords, followed by symbols which specify the chord quality.
Slurs are used to indicate motion, with solid slurs connecting roots an descending fifth or ascending fourth apart or dotted slurs indicating leading-tone resolution (in a dominant substitution). Macro analysis, placed below the score, may be accompanied by roman numeral analysis, placed below it.
Other systems of notation for chords include:
plain staff notation, used in classical music, Roman numerals, commonly used in harmonic analysis,
figured bass, much used in the Baroque era, and various names and symbols used in jazz and popular music.

Steamboats on the Danube

The Danube Steamboat Shipping Company, Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft was a shipping company founded in 1829 by the Austrian government for transporting passengers and cargo on the River Danube. It was formed by two Englishmen--Andrews and Prichard. The first attempt to use steamers on the river was in 1813 by the Austrians, but the experiment did not go well.
The DDSG company ran the vessel Franz 1 between Vienna and Budapest and it was a success. Soon other routes were but on by the company with a run to Linz with the Maria Anna. A Bavarian company ran vessels downstream to Austria from Ulm.
In 1880, the DDSG was the world's largest river shipping company with more than 200 steamboat ships and about 1000 cargo tubs. It owned its own coal mines in the Pecs area of Hungary. It ran river vessels from Germany to the Danube's mouth in Roumania; it also had salt water vessels running on the Mediterranean from Constantinople to Trieste, then an Austrian colony. This was the Royal Hungarian River and Sea shipping Company or MFTR.
Steamboats on the Danube were, by the end of the 19th century, dominated by the Austrian-based DDSG. A new organisation was formed in 1896, based in the Hungarian part of the Habsburg empire, which was to become a significant player in both the freight haulage and passenger businesses. The MFTR took over the fleet of the Hungarian Railways (MAV) in 1914 and eventually became MAHART, a company which continues to exist in the Danube freight business.

SS Radetzky and the Birth of Bulgaria.
A Bulgarian school teacher turned revolutionary named Hristo Botev rose up against the Ottoman overlords in 1876. He seized the steamer Radetzky and used it as a platform for the birth of the new nation Bulgaria. Botev was shot by a Bashi-bazouk during the rebellion, but Russian intervenion in 1878 secured Bulgaria's independence. The reconstructed vessel is now museum ship in Bulgaria, albeit with
diesel engines.

River Gunboats on the Danube.
The Austrian navy built powerful river monitors to patrol the 
Danube River from 1870-1918. The first were the Maros and Leitha It had 3 generations of patrol boats.
The siege of Belgrade in 1917 was conducted with gunboats.
After the loss of the empire in the First World War, some of the 
vessels were transferred to Yugoslav ownership. The Roumanians also
had river patrol boats. The Roumanian Danube Flotilla was more modern, and consisted of four river monitors (Lascăr Catargiu, Mihail Kogălniceanu, Ion C. Brătianu and Alexandru Lahovari) and eight British-built torpedo boats. The four river monitors were built in Italy during 1907-1907 and assembled at Galați. They were armed with three 12-cm cannons each. The British torpedo boats from the Căpitan Nicolae Lascăr Bogdan class were built during 1906-1907 and weighed 50tons each. There were also approximately six older gunboats used for border patrol, minelayers and other auxiliary ships used for transport or supply.] The Romanian Navy had a secondary role during World War I and only had light losses. The river monitors participated in the defense of Tutrakan and later secured the flank of the Romanian and Russian defenders in Dobrudja. The main success of the war was the mining of an Austro-Hungarian river monitor.

Soviet Armed gunboats on the Danube.
With the Soviet seizure of Bessarabia in1940 and the dissolution
of Europe into chaos, the Russians had a shoreline on the Danube.
The bigger boat, known as BKA (bronirovannyie katera, or armored cutter) 1124, had two turrets initially taken from T-26 tanks and mounting 45mm guns. The boat displaced 42 tons, was 25 meters long and had 12mm of armor on its “citadel” protecting the engines and other vitals. While drawing more water than a half-meter, it still could operate in very shallow waters as it only drew 0.80 meters.
The smaller version, known as BKA 1125, only drew 0.5 meters and displaced 29 tons. These were only slightly shorter (22.6 meters) but had less armor protection.
Series production began in 1935 at small shipyards along the Soviet Union’s inland rivers, and were delivered in 1941.
By the time of the 1941 Russian invasion by Germany, 85 boats had been delivered with 68 more under construction. They went into action very early, with boats of the Danube flotilla infiltrating Romanian defenses to land troops on 24 June and routing Romanian marines defending the Danube delta.
World War II.
By 1935, a new power had appeared through the entire length of the Danube — Nazi Germany, whose new self-propelled barges swiftly moved up and down the river outside Germany's borders, "the pioneers of the new order. They flew the Swastika and were built of bullet-proof steel."
The Germans were held to the Danube as it moved the Roumanian oil
in barges from Ploesti back to the Fatherland for use in industry.
Germany invaded Hungary in 1944 ending the Horthy regime and the puppet state. During the Third Reich era, the DDSG was involved in transporting Jews after Kristallnacht.
The Allies counteracted--RAF 205 Group flew 152 night sorties against Danube shipping and US bombers attacked the river ports by day.
The steamers were sunk at the quayside in the air raids, but the worst
menace were the air dropped mines in the river which sunk 40 percent of the vessels.
See Nazi rule over the Danube River
Reconstruction.
The destruction of Europe by the war, included many destroyed vessels.
The Armies of Occupation, including the U.S. Army, and funded by
the United Nations Recovery and Reconstruction Administration,
(later World Bank), attempted to restart shipping. This included 
repairing or clearing the wrecked bridges as all of the bridges over the Danube had been bombed. The river was
cleared of wreckage, ships were raised and repaired and the Danube basin put back to work. Of paramount importance was the movement of coal for heating and industry.
The hard winter of 1947 caused the river to freeze solid, impeding
the movement of ships. US army engineers dynamited the floes to open
shipping lanes and relieve the buckling pressure of ice on hulls.
From this the steam paddlers worked until the1970s when they were retired.
One vessel the SS Schoenbrunn is run as a tourist boat, but was damaged in a collision five years ago.
The Vienna docks consists of 3 harbour facilities: a key element is the Freudenauer Hafen with the biggest container terminal in a European inland harbour (1996: overall container handling 159,049 TEU), and with storage centre, duty-free area, car terminal and the head of 3 of Vienna’s harbour associations, it still lives up to its original function as protective and winter harbour. The Alberner Hafen, originally conceived as grain harbour (granary capacity: 90,000t), still plays a major role in corn exports today. The oil harbour Lobau is also a protective and winter harbour for oil tankers and is connected through pipelines
In 1991 the company was divided up with a cargo shipping enterprise and a passenger leisure cruising business and these two private companies still exist.

Snappers are a family of perciform fish, Lutjanidae, mainly marine, but with some members inhabiting estuaries, feeding in freshwater. Some are important food fish. One of the best known is the red snapper.
Snappers inhabit tropical and subtropical regions of all oceans. They can grow to about in length. Most feed on crustaceans or other fish, though a few are plankton-feeders. They can be kept in aquaria, but mostly grow too fast to be popular aquarium fish. They live at depths reaching .
As other fish, snappers harbour parasites. A detailed study conducted in New Caledonia has shown that coral reef-associated snappers harbour about 9 species of parasites per fish species.

Köln-Düsseldorfer

Köln-Düsseldorfer (KD) is a river cruise operator based in Cologne, Germany. The company operates a total of 14 cruise ships on the Rhine, Main and Moselle rivers. 
The famous KD steamer line operated on the Rhine both with connecting steamers and tourist boats. The Lorelei rock was a famed day outing for pleasure seekers.
History.
Early history of tourism in Germany.
The first steamboats arrived from England in 1816, heralding a new age of tourism in Germany. Ten years later, the first German shipping line started up its operation between Cologne and Mainz; by 1856 the millionth ticket was proudly sold. In 1832, the first steam boat journeyed from the North Sea all the way to Basel, but this was not a regular service. Mannheim was an established port by 1840, and the river became heavily travelled during the industrial revolution. In 1846 the Ludwig-Donau-Canal was completed after 9 years of work. It was named after King Ludwig I of Bavaria.
The KD Line founded.
The KD Steamer Line can trace its history back to 1853 when two earlier companies, the Preussisch-Rheinischen Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft (PRDG), the "Köln" company and the Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft für den Nieder- und Mittelrhein (DGNM), the "Düsseldorf" company, merged at a time of intense competition and in response to the loss of much of the freight and passenger traffic along the Rhine following the expansion of the railways along its banks.
The KD Line grows.
Despite the merger, the two companies, which were established in 1826 and 1836 respectively, maintained semi-independent operations ordering their own vessels which were known as "Köln" or "Düsseldorf" boats. Although other companies operated vessels during this period, especially in the more northerly and southerly stretches of the river, the KD came to dominate and absorb the competitors, such as the Mülheim Company (MDAG), with the exception of the Dutch Steamboat Company (NSM/NSR), which traced its inception back to 1823, when steam was first introduced for passenger and goods transport.
Fleet.
Paddle steamers.
The KD operated 38 paddle steamers at the outbreak of World War I and 20 at the outbreak of World War II and, although the latter war in particular brought severe losses, it was still felt suitable to raise and rebuild wrecked vessels for further service. The last survivor, "Goethe", returned to service in heavily rebuilt form in 1952, and for the 1953 season, there ware 14 large paddlers on the roster. In 1969 this had been reduced to 6 although the shortfall in capacity had been made up by the introduction of similar sized motor vessels. After 1974, with the withdrawal of "Cecilie" and "Bismarck", three paddlers remained, all of which survive.
Preservation.
The former KD Rhein paddler "Mainz" serves as a floating industrial museum on the River Neckar at Mannheim near the Kurpfalzbrücke. Built in 1929, and operational until 1980, she was disposed of from the KD reserve fleet in 1984 and opened in her new use in 1986. Her machinery remains intact.
"Goethe" remains the only vessel now serving with the KD and is the last example of paddle propulsion.

Alaska Wilderness League

The Alaska Wilderness League (AWL) is a nonprofit organization that works to protect Alaska’s most significant wild lands from oil and gas drilling and from other industrial threats. Founded in 1993, AWL has its main office in Washington, DC, with additional offices in Anchorage and Juneau, Alaska.
For the past ten years, AWL has taken the lead in the fight to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from being opened to oil and gas development, and its leadership has made a significant impact in this area. The organization has rallied public support and successfully stopped numerous attempts by Congress to open the refuge to development.
In 2001, AWL and its supporters helped fund photographer Subhankar Banerjee’s ground-breaking winter field photography in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The photos he took were published in the book "Seasons of Life and Land". Banerjee’s photographs of the Refuge were exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History, and controversy erupted when his captions for the photos were altered and the exhibit was moved to a far corner of the museum. Some charged that Alaska Senator Ted Stevens had used political pressure to remove the exhibit from the spotlight because Senator Barbara Boxer had held up Banerjee’s book during a Senate floor debate over oil drilling in the Refuge, but the museum maintained the changes were made “for artistic reasons”. 
Starting in 2004, AWL expanded its work to include ecologically significant areas of Alaska’s vast National Petroleum Reserve, the Tongass National Forest, and the outer continental shelf areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.
AWL's work has had long-standing support from President Jimmy Carter, who remains the Honorary Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Bass–Serre theory

Bass–Serre theory is a part of the mathematical subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory.
History.
Bass–Serre theory was developed by Jean-Pierre Serre in 1970s and formalized in "Trees", Serre's seminal 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject. Serre's original motivation was to understand the structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat–Tits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of Hyman Bass contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term "Bass–Serre theory" is widely used to describe the subject.
Mathematically, Bass–Serre theory builds on exploiting and generalizing the properties of two older group-theoretic constructions: free product with amalgamation and HNN extension. However, unlike the traditional algebraic study of these two constructions, Bass–Serre theory uses the geometric language of covering theory and fundamental groups. Graphs of groups, which are the basic objects of Bass–Serre theory, can be viewed as one-dimensional versions of orbifolds.
Apart from Serre's book, the basic treatment of Bass–Serre theory is available in the article of Bass, the article of Scott and Wall and the books of Hatcher, Baumslag, Dicks and Dunwoody and Cohen.
Basic set-up.
Graphs in the sense of Serre.
Serre's formalism of graphs is slightly different from the standard set-up of graph theory. Here a graph "A" consists of a "vertex set" "V", an "edge set" "E", an "edge reversal" map formula_1 such that ≠ "e" and formula_2 for every "e" in "E", and an "initial vertex map" "o" : "E" → "V". Thus in "A" every edge "e" comes equipped with its "formal inverse" . The vertex "o"("e") is called the "origin" or the "initial vertex" of "e" and the vertex "o"() is called the "terminus" of "e" and is denoted "t"("e"). Both loop-edges (that is, edges "e" such that "o"("e") = "t"("e")) and multiple edges are allowed. An "orientation" on "A" is a partition of "E" into the union of two disjoint subsets "E"+ and "E"− so that for every edge "e" exactly one of the edges from the pair "e", belongs to "E"+ and the other belongs to "E"−.
Graphs of groups.
A "graph of groups" A consists of the following data:
For every "e"∈"E" the map formula_5 is also denoted by "ωe".
Fundamental group of a graph of groups.
There are two equivalent definitions of the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups: the first is a direct algebraic definition via an explicit group presentation (as a certain iterated application of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions), and the second using the language of groupoids.
The algebraic definition is easier to state:
First, choose a spanning tree "T" in "A". The fundamental group of "A" with respect to "T", denoted π1(A, "T"), is defined as the quotient of the free product 
where "F"("E") is a free group with free basis "E", subject to the following relations:
There is also a notion of the fundamental group of "A" with respect to a base-vertex "v" in "V", denoted π1(A, "v"), which is defined using the formalism of groupoids. It turns out that for every choice of a base-vertex "v" and every spanning tree "T" in "A" the groups π1(A, "T") and π1(A, "v") are naturally isomorphic.
The fundamental group of a graph of groups has a natural topological interpretation as well: it is the fundamental group of a graph of spaces whose vertex spaces and edge spaces have the fundamental groups of the vertex groups and edge groups, respectively, and whose gluing maps induce the homomorphisms of the edge groups into the vertex groups. One can therefore take this as a third definition of the fundamental group of a graph of groups.
Fundamental groups of graphs of groups as iterations of amalgamated products and HNN-extensions.
The group "G" = π1(A, "T") defined above admits an algebraic description in terms of iterated amalgamated free products and HNN extensions. First, form a group "B" as a quotient of the free product
subject to the relations
This presentation can be rewritten as
which shows that "B" is an iterated amalgamated free product of the vertex groups "Av".
Then the group "G" = π1(A, "T") has the presentation
which shows that "G" = π1(A, "T") is a multiple HNN extension of "B" with stable letters formula_13.
Splittings.
An isomorphism between a group "G" and the fundamental group of a graph of groups is called a "splitting" of "G". If the edge groups in the splitting come from a particular class of groups (e.g. finite, cyclic, abelian, etc.), the splitting is said to be a "splitting over" that class. Thus a splitting where all edge groups are finite is called a splitting over finite groups.
Algebraically, a splitting of "G" with trivial edge groups corresponds to a free product decomposition
where "F"("X") is a free group with free basis "X" = "E"+("A"−"T") consisting of all positively oriented edges (with respect to some orientation on "A") in the complement of some spanning tree "T" of "A".
The normal forms theorem.
Let "g" be an element of "G" = π1(A, "T") represented as a product of the form
where "e"1, ..., "en" is a closed edge-path in "A" with the vertex sequence "v"0, "v"1, ..., "vn" = "v"0 (that is "v"0="o"("e"1), "vn" = "t"("en") and "vi" = "t"("ei") = "o"("e""i"+1) for 0 < "i" < "n") and where formula_16 for "i" = 0, ..., "n".
Suppose that "g" = 1 in "G". Then 
The normal forms theorem immediately implies that the canonical homomorphisms "Av" → π1(A, "T") are injective, so that we can think of the vertex groups "A""v" as subgroups of "G".
Higgins has given a nice version of the normal form using the fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups. This avoids choosing a base point or tree, and has been exploited in.
Bass–Serre covering trees.
To every graph of groups A, with a specified choice of a base-vertex, one can associate a "Bass–Serre covering tree" formula_19, which is a tree that comes equipped with a natural group action of the fundamental group π1(A, "v") without edge-inversions.
Moreover, the quotient graph formula_20 is isomorphic to "A".
Similarly, if "G" is a group acting on a tree "X" without edge-inversions (that is, so that for every edge "e" of "X" and every "g" in "G" we have "ge" ≠ ), one can define the natural notion of a "quotient graph of groups" A. The underlying graph "A" of A is the quotient graph "X/G". The vertex groups of A are isomorphic to vertex stabilizers in "G" of vertices of "X" and the edge groups of A are isomorphic to edge stabilizers in "G" of edges of "X".
Moreover, if "X" was the Bass–Serre covering tree of a graph of groups A and if "G" = π1(A, "v") then the quotient graph of groups for the action of "G" on "X" can be chosen to be naturally isomorphic to A.
Fundamental theorem of Bass–Serre theory.
Let "G" be a group acting on a tree "X" without inversions. Let A be the quotient graph of groups and let "v" be a base-vertex in "A". Then "G" is isomorphic to the group π1(A, "v") and there is an equivariant isomorphism between the tree "X" and the Bass–Serre covering tree formula_19. More precisely, there is a group isomorphism σ: "G" → π1(A, "v") and a graph isomorphism formula_22 such that for every "g" in "G", for every vertex "x" of "X" and for every edge "e" of "X" we have "j"("gx") = "g" "j"("x") and "j"("ge") = "g" "j"("e").
One of the immediate consequences of the above result is the classic Kurosh subgroup theorem describing the algebraic structure of subgroups of free products.
Examples.
Amalgamated free product.
Consider a graph of groups A consisting of a single non-loop edge "e" (together with its formal inverse ) with two distinct end-vertices "u" = "o"("e") and "v" = "t"("e"), vertex groups "H" = "Au", "K" = "Av", an edge group "C" = "Ae" and the boundary monomorphisms formula_23. Then "T" = "A" is a spanning tree in "A" and the fundamental group π1(A, "T") is isomorphic to the amalgamated free product
In this case the Bass–Serre tree formula_25 can be described as follows. The vertex set of "X" is the set of cosets
Two vertices "gK" and "fH" are adjacent in "X" whenever there exists "k" ∈ "K" such that "fH" = "gkH" (or, equivalently, whenever there is "h" ∈ "H" such that "gK" = "fhK").
The "G"-stabilizer of every vertex of "X" of type "gK" is equal to "gKg"−1 and the "G"-stabilizer of every vertex of "X" of type "gH" is equal to "gHg"−1. For an edge ["gH", "ghK"] of "X" its "G"-stabilizer is equal to "gh"α("C")"h"−1"g"−1.
For every "c" ∈ "C" and "h" ∈ 'k" ∈ "K' the edges ["gH", "ghK"] and ["gH, gh"α("c")"K"] are equal and the degree of the vertex "gH" in "X" is equal to the index ["H":α("C")]. Similarly, every vertex of type "gK" has degree ["K":ω("C")] in "X".
HNN extension.
Let A be a graph of groups consisting of a single loop-edge "e" (together with its formal inverse ), a single vertex "v" = "o"("e") = "t"("e"), a vertex group "B" = "Av", an edge group "C" = "Ae" and the boundary monomorphisms formula_27. Then "T" = "v" is a spanning tree in "A" and the fundamental group π1(A, "T") is isomorphic to the HNN extension
with the base group "B", stable letter "e" and the associated subgroups "H" = α("C"), "K" = ω("C") in "B". The composition formula_29 is an isomorphism and the above HNN-extension presentation of "G" can be rewritten as
In this case the Bass–Serre tree formula_25 can be described as follows. The vertex set of "X" is the set of cosets "VX" = {"gB" : "g" ∈ "G"}.
Two vertices "gB" and "fB" are adjacent in "X" whenever there exists "b" in "B" such that either "fB" = "gbeB" or "fB" = "gbe"−1"B". The "G"-stabilizer of every vertex of "X" is conjugate to "B" in "G" and the stabilizer of every edge of "X" is conjugate to "H" in "G". Every vertex of "X" has degree equal to ["B" : "H"] + ["B" : "K"].
A graph with the trivial graph of groups structure.
Let A be a graph of groups with underlying graph "A" such that all the vertex and edge groups in A are trivial. Let "v" be a base-vertex in "A". Then "π"1(A,"v") is equal to the fundamental group "π"1("A","v") of the underlying graph "A" in the standard sense of algebraic topology and the Bass–Serre covering tree formula_32 is equal to the standard universal covering space formula_33 of "A". Moreover, the action of "π"1(A,"v") on formula_32 is exactly the standard action of "π"1("A","v") on formula_33 by deck transformations.
Trivial and nontrivial actions.
A graph of groups A is called "trivial" if "A" = "T" is already a tree and there is some vertex "v" of "A" such that "Av" = π1(A, "A"). This is equivalent to the condition that "A" is a tree and that for every edge "e" = ["u", "z"] of "A" (with "o"("e") = "u", "t"("e") = "z") such that "u" is closer to "v" than "z" we have ["Az" : ω"e"("Ae")] = 1, that is "Az" = ω"e"("Ae").
An action of a group "G" on a tree "X" without edge-inversions is called "trivial" if there exists a vertex "x" of "X" that is fixed by "G", that is such that "Gx" = "x". It is known that an action of "G" on "X" is trivial if and only if the quotient graph of groups for that action is trivial.
Typically, only nontrivial actions on trees are studied in Bass–Serre theory since trivial graphs of groups do not carry any interesting algebraic information, although trivial actions in the above sense (e. g. actions of groups by automorphisms on rooted trees) may also be interesting for other mathematical reasons.
One of the classic and still important results of the theory is a theorem of Stallings about ends of groups. The theorem states that a finitely generated group has more than one end if and only if this group admits a nontrivial splitting over finite subroups that is, if and only if the group admits a nontrivial action without inversions on a tree with finite edge stabilizers.
An important general result of the theory states that if "G" is a group with Kazhdan's property (T) then "G" does not admit any nontrivial splitting, that is, that any action of "G" on a tree "X" without edge-inversions has a global fixed vertex.
Hyperbolic length functions.
Let "G" be a group acting on a tree "X" without edge-inversions.
For every "g"∈"G" put
Then "ℓX"("g") is called the "translation length" of "g" on "X".
The function
is called the "hyperbolic length function" or the "translation length function" for the action of "G" on "X".
Basic facts regarding hyperbolic length functions.
The length-function "ℓX" : "G" → Z is said to be "abelian" if it is a group homomorphism from "G" to Z and "non-abelian" otherwise. Similarly, the action of "G" on "X" is said to be "abelian" if the associated hyperbolic length function is abelian and is said to be "non-abelian" otherwise.
In general, an action of "G" on a tree "X" without edge-inversions is said to be "minimal" if there are no proper "G"-invariant subtrees in "X".
An important fact in the theory says that minimal non-abelian tree actions are uniquely determined by their hyperbolic length functions:
Uniqueness theorem.
Let "G" be a group with two nonabelian minimal actions without edge-inversions on trees "X" and "Y". Suppose that the hyperbolic length functions "ℓ""X" and "ℓ""Y" on "G" are equal, that is "ℓ""X"("g") = "ℓ""Y"("g") for every "g" ∈ "G". Then the actions of "G" on "X" and "Y" are equal in the sense that there exists a graph isomorphism "f" : "X" → "Y" which is "G"-equivariant, that is "f"("gx") = "g" "f"("x") for every "g" ∈ "G" and every "x" ∈ "VX".

The Story (band)

The Story was an early 1990s folk-rock duo composed of Jonatha Brooke and Jennifer Kimball.
History.
Jonatha Brooke and Jennifer Kimball first met in 1981 while freshmen at Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts. Originally called simply "Jonatha and Jennifer", they performed regularly throughout the Boston area until graduation, at which time Brooke started working in a dance company and Kimball went to a publishing firm.
In 1989 the duo recorded a demo, "Over Oceans", and were quickly signed by Green Linnet Records. They changed their name to The Story, and their debut album Grace in Gravity appeared in 1991. Elektra Records then snapped up the band, reissuing the album a year later. Angel in the House followed in 1993, but a year later The Story dissolved.
Known for their ethereal and dissonant vocal harmonies, both Brooke and Kimball have gone on to critically acclaimed solo careers. Although The Story's work has been highly regarded by critics and fans alike, both Brooke and Kimball have individually downplayed the band's work.

Montauk Monster

The "Montauk Monster" was an animal carcass, thought to be a raccoon, that washed ashore on a beach near the business district of Montauk, New York in July 2008. The identity of the creature and the veracity of stories surrounding it have been the subject of controversy and speculation. It is not known what happened to the carcass.
History.
The story began on July 23, 2008 with an article in a local newspaper, "The Independent". Jenna Hewitt, 26, of Montauk, and three friends said they found the creature on July 12 at the Ditch Plains beach, two miles east of the district. The beach is a popular surfing spot at Rheinstein Estate Park owned by the town of East Hampton. Jenna Hewitt was quoted:
Her color photograph of the creature ran in black and white under the headline, "The Hound of Bonacville" (a take-off on the name Bonackers, which refers to the natives of East Hampton, and "The Hound of the Baskervilles" which is a book in the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle). The light-hearted article speculated that the creature might be a turtle or some mutant experiment from the Plum Island Animal Disease Center before noting that Larry Penny, the East Hampton Natural Resources Director, had concluded it was a raccoon with its upper jaw missing. There were rumors that the carcass had been taken away from the site. A local newspaper quoted an anonymous resident who claimed that the animal was only the size of a cat, and that it had decomposed to a skeleton by the time of the press coverage. She would not identify its location for inspection. Hewitt claimed that "a guy took it and put it in the woods in his backyard", but would not say who or where. Her father denied that his daughter was keeping the body's location a secret.
Hewitt and her friends were interviewed on Plum-TV, a local public-access television show. Alanna Navitski, an employee of Evolutionary Media Group in Los Angeles, California, passed a photo of the creature to Anna Holmes at Jezebel, claiming that a friend's sister saw the monster in Montauk. Holmes then passed it along to fellow Gawker Media website Gawker.com which gave it wide attention on July 29 under the headline "Dead Monster Washes Ashore in Montauk".
Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman at Cryptomundo first coined the name the "Montauk Monster" on July 29, 2008. The moniker was disseminated globally on the Internet in the following days. Photographs were widely circulated via email and weblogs, and the national media picked up on it raising speculation about the creature. The potential urban legend stature of the Montauk Monster was noted by Snopes.
The monster has been discussed on Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory.
On August 4, 2011 the Montauk Monster was featured on the second episode of the third season of Ancient Aliens, titled "Aliens and Monsters".
Identifications.
Palaeozoologist Darren Naish studied the photograph and concluded from visible dentition and the front paws that the creature was a raccoon, with its odd appearance merely a byproduct of decomposition and water action removing most of the animal's hair and some of its flesh.
Speculation in published reports included theories that the Montauk Monster might have been a turtle without its shell—even though turtles' shells cannot be removed without damaging the spine, and they do not have teeth as appear in the photograph—a dog, or a science experiment from the nearby government animal testing facility, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. The creature's appearance was believed to have been altered through immersion in water for an extended period before coming to rest on the shore, making it difficult to identify.
William Wise, director of Stony Brook University's Living Marine Resources Institute, interpreted the photo along with a colleague; they deemed the creature a fake, most likely the result of "someone who got very creative with latex", although his "next-best guess" was that the creature could be a diseased dog or coyote which had "been in the sea for a while". Wise discounted the following general possibilities:
On August 1, Gawker published pictures and X-ray images of a water rat, an Australian rodent with several similarities to the Montauk Monster, such as the beak, tail, feet, and size. On the same day, Jeff Corwin appeared on Fox News and claimed that upon close inspection of the photograph, he feels sure the monster is merely a raccoon or dog that has decomposed slightly. This was backed up by Darren Naish, a British paleontologist, who examined the images and agreed that, if real, the creature was a raccoon. Naish says that "claims that the limb proportions of the Montauk carcass are unlike those of raccoons are not correct", and on his blog he provides an illustration of an intact raccoon corpse drawn over the corpse in the photograph. Furthermore he points out the strong resemblance of the skull profile to that of a raccoon, and the long fingers, which are typical of raccoons, and unlike those of other carnivores, e.g. dogs.
On August 5, 2008, Fox News Channel's Morning Show repeated speculation that the beast is a decayed corpse of a capybara, even though capybaras do not have tails. The next day, the same program reported that an unnamed man claimed that the animal's carcass had been stolen from his front yard.
In a 2009 episode of "Monster Quest", cryptozoologist Loren Coleman examined a latex replica of the Montauk Monster's remains and proposed that it was the remains of a raccoon, due to similar body structures and skull shape.
Similar cases.
On March 30, 2011, an odd-looking unidentified creature was found in Northville, New York, and the student who discovered it found it to "resemble the Montauk Monster in a lot of ways". In July 2012, a similar-looking creature dubbed the East River Monster was found beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, in the East River, New York City. Although the Parks Department identified it as a pig carcass before disposing of it, comparisons were drawn to the Montauk Monster.

Unguentarium

An unguentarium (plural "unguentaria") is a small ceramic or glass bottle found frequently by archaeologists at Hellenistic and Roman sites, especially in cemeteries. Its most common use was probably as a container for oil, though it is also suited for storing and dispensing liquid and powdered substances. Some finds date into the early Christian era. From the 2nd to the 6th century they are more often made of blown glass rather than clay. A few examples are silver or alabaster.
Unguentaria were used as product packaging in commerce and for funerary practice. They are distributed throughout the Mediterranean region of the Roman Empire from Palestine to Spain, and north into Britain and Germania. Their manufacture was nearly as widespread.
Forms and function.
The term "unguentarium" is functional rather than descriptive; that is, it refers to the purpose for which this relatively small vessel is thought to have been used and is not typological by shape. In its early development, the shape was modeled in miniature after larger amphoras, which would have been the original bulk shipping containers for products sold in the ungentaria. An unguentarium is not always distinguished in the scholarly literature from an ampulla, a term from antiquity that may refer to these as well as other small vessels. In scholarship of the modern era, an unguentarium is sometimes called a lacrimarium ("tear-container") or balsamarium ("balsam-container"). All three terms reflect modern usage based on assumptions about their use, and no single word is found in ancient sources for the vessels.
Small vessels of two shapes, usually but not always without handles, are referred to as unguentaria:
Fusiform. The fusiform shape (example here) is characteristic of Hellenistic unguentaria: a heavy ovoid body resting usually on a small distinct ring foot, with a long tubular neck or cylindrical stem. The shape is comparable to a spindle (Latin "fusus", "spindle"). These ovoid unguentaria first appear in Cyprus around the turn of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. and may have been Near Eastern in origin or influence. Early examples are similar in shape to the amphoriskos. They are believed to develop functionally from the lekythos, which they replace by the end of the 4th century BC. The fusiform unguentarium was in use for several centuries and the form shows many variations, including later examples with very slender profiles.
Piriform. The unguentarium with a footless body that is rounded or pear-shaped (Latin "pirus", "pear") began to appear in the second half of the 1st century BC and is characteristic of the Roman era, particularly the early Principate. These are regularly associated with graves in the 1st century. The piriform unguentarium was in use for a limited period of about a hundred years and did not replace the fusiform. A puzzling exception to this chronology is the squat rounded unguentarium with painted bands found on the northeast coast of Spain and in other Iberian cemeteries, dated as early as the 5th century BC.
The word "bulbous" is used rather confusingly in the scholarship to describe both forms. "Bulbous" appears as a synonym for "piriform," but is applied descriptively to the fusiform to distinguish certain examples from more slender profiles.
Thin blown-glass bottles began to appear in Cyprus after the middle of the 1st century BC. The use of the new medium for unguentaria resulted in variations of form, including the thin, "test-tube" type. Glass unguentaria made in Thessaly, for example, often have a distinctive conical body, flared like the bell of a trumpet, or are squat and rounded with a very long neck; they come in a range of colors including aquamarine, pale green, and yellowish green, or may be colorless. This shape was popular in the 2nd and 3rd centuries and is also characteristic of Thrace and Cyprus.
Glass bird-shaped containers for cosmetics found at various Roman sites from Herculaneum to Spain have also been called unguentaria. In these examples, dating from the period of the piriform type, the neck has become a spout, and the profile is no longer vertical. As with other unguentaria, no clear distinction can be made between the use of these vessels for grooming in daily life, and their inclusion in tombs.
Commercial and secular use.
In her typology of Hellenistic vessels at Athens used to contain and pour oil, Susan I. Rotroff classes unguentaria with plastic askoi as used for perfumed oil in bathing and grooming, but notes the diversity of craft tradition associated with them. Most unguentaria from the Athenian agora were probably intended for secular use, as they are found in household dumps; the pattern of deposition in some wells, however, suggests votive offerings.
It has been suggested that products shipped in bulk containers were dispensed for sale in these smaller vessels. Perfumed oils, ointments, balsam, jasmine, kohl, honey, mastic, incense, scent powders and cosmetic preparations are among the contents proposed by scholars or evidenced by archaeology. With their long slender necks, the vessels were most suited for dispensing liquids, oils, and powders. Roman examples of bulbous unguentaria have been found with traces of olive oil. A sharp distinction should not be made between cosmetics and medicaments, as ingredients for these preparations often overlap. Chemical analysis of red and pink substances in two glass unguentaria from the Ebro valley in Spain showed that they were likely cosmetics, but similar ingredients are found in therapeutic recipes. The name "unguentarium" may be misleading, as solid unguents, or ointments, would be difficult to remove through the narrow neck. There is little or no evidence of how the contents were prevented from spilling, as no corks, wax or clay seals, or lead stoppers have been found with unguentaria as they have with other vessels.
The manufacture of unguentaria seems to occur in conjunction with the marketing of products. Roman glass unguentaria often have markings or lettering, usually on the base, that could indicate the manufacturer of the vessel or the supplier or dealer of the product inside. Nabataean piriform wheel-thrown unguentaria show creative variations by potters, perhaps to establish brand identity for the product they contained. These vessels include some of the larger unguentaria and may have been used for shipping as part of the Nabataeans' active perfume trade.
Mass production of Roman blown-glass unguentaria is indicated by their frequent asymmetry, which results from speed and timing in shearing the neck from the blow-pipe. Recycled glass, as from a large, heavy broken bottle, could have been used to make many of the smaller unguentaria.
Funerary and religious context.
While unguentaria often appear among grave goods, the purpose of their inclusion has not been determined with certainty or may vary by site. Unguentaria found in burials range in size from miniatures (4–5 cm.) to large examples 20 to 30 cm. high. The presence of the vessel in Hellenistic graves may indicate a revival of an earlier practice, attested in the 6th century by aryballoi and in some 5th- and early 4th-century burials by small lekythoi, which involved the deposit of a small container of perfume or oil with the dead. By the 3rd century, the black-figure lekythos with palmettes or Dionysiac scenes has been completely replaced as a standard grave good by the undecorated, "cruder" unguentarium, indicating a shift in burial practice that is characteristic of the period.
Although the unguentaria seem often to have been buried along with other objects associated with or treasured by the deceased or as grave gifts, they may have also have held a substance — such as oil, wine, or powdered incense — for a graveside ritual. The design of many unguentaria would not permit them to stand without support, but no stands have been found. Late Hellenistic gravestones depict unguentaria resting in a support, but they would also fit well in the palm of the hand, as shown in this Egyptian mummy portrait. Ritual dispensing, rather than long-term storage, might explain both the lack of durability needed for use in daily life and the absence of stands, stoppers or seals.
There is no standard assemblage of grave goods for which an unguentarium was required. Unguentaria often appear among articles for personal grooming; in one example, with a stone cosmetics pallet, strigils, tweezers and a pyxis, and in another, with a pyxis, mirror, bronze scissors and tongs. Gravestones from Anatolia depict the deceased with a similar group of objects, including mirror, comb, boxes and cistai, wool basket, and unguentaria. One Athenian burial produced five bulbous unguentaria along with five knucklebones and a bronze needle; another, of a female child, contained an unguentarium, earrings, a blue glass pendant, and six knucklebones. Gold leaves and unguentaria were the grave gifts in a burial chamber at Kourion in Cyprus.
At Amisos (modern Samsun) in the Black Sea region of Turkey, the grave goods in the early Hellenistic tomb of a wealthy family were exceptionally rich and of outstanding workmanship, but the unguentaria were plain and made of clay. One of the bodies was adorned with gold earrings in the shape of Nike, ten gold appliqués of Thetis riding a hippocamp, snake bracelets and bracelets with lion-head terminals, and other gold items; on the right side of the skull was placed a single clay unguentarium.
Some graves contain multiple unguentaria, in one case numbering 31 of the fusiform type, while others hold a single example. Grave gifts sometimes consisted of nothing but unguentaria. Neither the piriform unguentaria nor thin blown-glass vessels occur in burials before the Augustan period. In Mainz, unguentaria are the most common grave gifts made of glass during the first half of the 1st century; in Gaul and Britain, glass unguentaria appear as containers for scented oils in both cremations and inhumations in this period and continuing into the 3rd century, but disappear by the 4th.
Rock-cut tombs at Labraunda, investigated in 2005, contained unguentaria.
The grave goods of Jewish ossuaries at Jericho in the Second Temple period often include unguentaria along with bowls, lamps, and various vessels ordinarily encountered in daily life.
Unguentaria have also been found in Athens in ritual pyres along with the burnt bones of animal sacrifice and smashed pottery. A single unguentarium was buried with a dog, possibly a pet, in an industrial district in Athens.
The many unguentaria at the Latin town of Aricia reflect the growth of commerce to support ritual activities at the famous sanctuary of Diana there.
Examples.
Most ceramic unguentaria either lack surface decoration or have simple horizontal lines around the neck or body consisting most often of three narrow bands of white paint.
Glass unguentaria vary widely in quality and show a range of colors. The Judean desert caves, for instance, yielded unguentaria of aquamarine glass with large bubbles. A striking example of a glass fusiform unguentarium from 1st-century Syria, a little over six inches tall, has a white spiral curling around the cerulean body. The base comes to an elongated, rounded point, and the lip is well-formed and prominent. Techniques of "marbling," intended to emulate fashionably extravagant vessels made of sardonyx during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, were used for unguentaria as well as bowls.
An exceptionally elaborate unguentarium was found in a cremation burial at Stobi in Macedonia. Made of milky glass, the vessel has a globular body decorated with an egg-and-dart motif around the top and festoons and vine clusters around the bottom. The middle had six panels illustrating various vessels, with two examples each of the hydria, oenochoe and crater.
In literature.
The use of the term "lacrimarium" or "lacrimatorium" (also "lacrymatory" or "lachrymatory") for unguentaria persisted because the small vessels were believed to have been used to collect the tears ("lacrimae") of mourners to accompany the beloved in the grave. This belief was supported by a scriptural reference () translated in the King James Bible as "put thou my tears into thy bottle." Shakespeare refers to the practice in "Antony and Cleopatra," when Cleopatra chides the Roman for shedding few tears over the death of his wife: "Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill / With sorrowful water?"
The minor Victorian poet Charles Tennyson Turner, brother of the more famous Tennyson, wrote a sonnet called "The Lachrymatory," elaborating the idea of "the phial of his kinsman’s tears." Since the early 20th century, the use of a vessel to collect tears of grief has been regarded as more poetic than plausible.
In January of 1896, The Atlantic Monthly published a poem by Frank Dempster Sherman (1860-1916) called "A Tear Bottle." which reference Greek Girl Tears, alluding to the role that the tear bottle played during Greek times

Riesz transform

In the mathematical theory of harmonic analysis, the Riesz transforms are a family of generalizations of the Hilbert transform to Euclidean spaces of dimension "d" > 1. They are a type of singular integral operator, meaning that they are given by a convolution of one function with another function having a singularity at the origin. Specifically, the Riesz transforms of a complex-valued function ƒ on R"d" are defined by
for "j" = 1,2...,"d". The constant "c""d" is a dimensional normalization given by
where ω"d"−1 is the volume of the ("d" − 1)-ball. The limit is written in various ways, often as a principal value, or as a convolution with the tempered distribution
(up to an overall positive constant depending on the normalization of the Fourier transform). In this form, the Riesz transforms are seen to be generalizations of the Hilbert transform. The kernel is a distribution which is homogeneous of degree zero. A particular consequence of this last observation is that the Riesz transform defines a bounded linear operator from "L"2(R"d") to itself.
This homogeneity property can also be stated more directly without the aid of the Fourier transform. If σ"s" is the dilation on R"d" by the scalar "s", that is σ"s""x" = "sx", then σ"s" defines an action on functions via pullback:
The Riesz transforms commute with σ"s":
Similarly, the Riesz transforms commute with translations. Let τ"a" be the translation on R"d" along the vector "a"; that is, τ"a"("x") = "x" + "a". Then
For the final property, it is convenient to regard the Riesz transforms as a single vectorial entity "R"ƒ = ("R"1ƒ,…,"R""d"ƒ). Consider a rotation ρ in R"d". The rotation acts on spatial variables, and thus on functions via pullback. But it also can act on the spatial vector "R"ƒ. The final transformation property asserts that the Riesz transform is equivariant with respect to these two actions; that is,
These three properties in fact characterize the Riesz transform in the following sense. Let "T"=("T""1",…,"T""d") be a "d"-tuple of bounded linear operators from "L"2(R"d") to "L"2(R"d") such that
Then, for some constant "c", "T" = "cR".
Relationship with the Laplacian.
Somewhat imprecisely, the Riesz transforms of ƒ give the first partial derivatives of a solution of the equation
where Δ is the Laplacian. Thus the Riesz transform of ƒ can be written as:
In particular, one should also have
so that the Riesz transforms give a way of recovering information about the entire hessian of a function from knowledge of only its Laplacian.
This is now made more precise. Suppose that "u" is a Schwartz function. Then indeed by the explicit form of the Fourier multiplier, one has
The identity is not generally true in the sense of distributions. For instance, if "u" is a tempered distribution such that Δ"u" ∈ "L"2(R"d"), then one can only conclude that

Subhankar Banerjee

Subhankar Banerjee (born 1967) is an artist, educator and activist whose images of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other Alaskan wild lands have captured international attention.
Born in Berhampore, India, Banerjee received his bachelor's degree in engineering before moving to the United States, where he received master's degrees in physics and computer science. He worked in scientific fields for six years at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Boeing in Seattle. In 2000 his childhood passion for art, coupled with a deep love and concern for the wilderness and disappearing indigenous cultures, caused him to leave his career in science and pursue art. Since then he has focused all his efforts on indigenous human rights and land conservation issues in the Arctic.
In 2001 Banerjee began the first of two years of ground-breaking year-around field photography in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The photos he took were published in the book "Seasons of Life and Land". Banerjee’s photographs of the Refuge were exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History, and controversy erupted when his captions for the photos were altered and the exhibit was moved to a far corner of the museum. Senator Richard J. Durbin and others in Congress felt that the Smithsonian had been pressured, probably by Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, to remove the exhibit from the spotlight because Senator Barbara Boxer had held up Banerjee’s book during a Senate floor debate over oil drilling in the Refuge. The museum maintained the changes were made “for artistic reasons”.

Sophie Cunningham

Sophie Cunningham is a Melbourne-based writer and editor.
Publisher.
Cunningham was publisher at McPhee Gribble/Penguin for two years and Trade Publisher at Allen & Unwin for ten, where she was known for commissioning and editing innovative fiction and non-fiction. At McPhee Gribble the books she worked on included "I Was a Teenage Fascist" by David Greason, "Glad All Over: The Countdown Years 1974-1987" by Peter Wilmoth and "Holding the Man" by Timothy Conigrave.
At Allen & Unwin she published Mark Davis's "Gangland: Cultural Elites and the New Generationalism".
Author.
In 2004, her own first novel, "Geography", was published. In 2005 she was an Asialink resident in Sri Lanka, which provided research material for her novel "Bird", which follows the life of a singer-actress who became a Buddhist nun.
Her non-fiction book "Melbourne" was published in 2011. Part memoir, part history, it is a portrait of the city as experienced through her own memories over the course of a year. In 2012 it was longlisted for the National Biography Award.
As of April 2012 she is working on her third novel, "This Devastating Fever", about Leonard Woolf's time as a colonial administrator in Ceylon, and a non-fiction book, "Warning", on Cyclone Tracy and other extreme weather events.
Cunningham has also written journalism, including travel writing, cultural analysis and writing on Buddhism and television. From 2002 to 2005, she wrote the Couch Life column for the television section of "The Age".
Meanjin.
In 2008 Cunningham became the editor of "Meanjin" and aimed to make the literary magazine "lighter, more fun, but I don't mean lightweight." She also aimed to establish a younger audience for the magazine.
During her time as editor, Cunningham significantly expanded the magazine's online presence and launched several successful public events in Melbourne and Sydney (notably Meanland, in collaboration with Jeff Sparrow, editor of fellow literary journal "Overland") to lead public debate on issues around digital publishing.
In 2010 she resigned, claiming she had been locked out of discussions about the publication's future and believed its owner, Melbourne University Press, intended to cease publishing the print edition. "I was not formally consulted once,” she told "Crikey". “I do know there was a sense – expressed by MUP – that I was not working with MUP closely enough and was being too independent. I had understood my task to be to keep "Meanjin"’s separate identity.”
Although there was speculation "Meanjin" would move to an online-only format, MUP chairman Alan Kohler denied this was the case.
Stella Prize.
In 2011, Cunningham was part of a group of 11 Australian women writers, editors, publishers and booksellers who became concerned about the poor representation of books by women in Australia's top literary prize, the Miles Franklin Award. In response, they established the Stella Prize (named after Stella Miles Franklin), a $50,000 annual award for writing by Australian women in all genres, similar to the UK's Orange Prize.
"After a rapid acceleration in women's rights in the '70s and '80s, things have started to go backwards," Cunningham said in a keynote address at the 2011 Melbourne Writers' Festival. "Women continue to be marginalised in Australian culture and, the arts sector – which likes to pride itself on its liberal values – is, in fact, complacent. Women are much less likely to win literary awards, to write reviews of books, or have their books reviewed. This, despite the fact they write about half the books published."
Personal life.
Cunningham's father is the literary scholar and critic Peter Nicholls, although they were not close for many years. She lives in Melbourne with her long-term partner Virginia Murdoch.

German submarine U-510

German submarine "U-510" was a Type IXC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II, which later served in the French Navy. The submarine was laid down on 1 November 1940 at the Deutsche Werft yard at Hamburg as 'werk' 306, launched on 4 September 1941, and commissioned on 25 November 1941 under the command of "Korvettenkapitän" Karl Neitzel.
After training with the 4th U-boat Flotilla at Stettin, "U-510" was transferred to the 10th U-boat Flotilla based at Lorient in occupied France, for front-line service on 1 August 1942. "Kapitänleutnant" Alfred Eick took command of the U-boat on 22 May 1943, and she was transferred to the 33rd flotilla on 1 October 1944 while operating in Southeast Asian waters. During her seven war patrols the U-boat sank fifteen ships totalling and damaged eight, totalling .
The U-boat was captured by American forces at Saint-Nazaire on 10 May 1945. Renamed Bouan she served in the French Navy from 1947 until struck on 1 May 1959. The submarine was broken up in 1960.
Service history.
1st patrol.
"U-510" departed Kiel on 7 July 1942, negotiated the gap between Iceland and the Faeroe Islands and sailed across the Atlantic to the northern coast of South America. There she attacked three ships and sank the 5,285 ton Uruguayan merchant ship "Maldonado" on 2 August. She also damaged the 8,016 ton British tanker on 10 August, and sank the 4,971 ton British merchant ship "Cressington Court" on 19 August. The U-boat docked at Lorient on 13 September.
2nd patrol.
"U-510" departed Lorient on 14 October 1942 and patrolled the waters west of the Canary Islands. On 31 October she torpedoed and damaged the 5,681 ton Norwegian merchant ship "Alaska" of Convoy SL 125 while the ship was rescuing men from the troopship "Président Doumer", which had been sunk by . After "Operation Torch" began on 8 November, The boat was ordered to patrol the coast of Morocco, but was bombed by an unidentified aircraft, causing a serious oil leak. She returned to Lorient on 12 December.
3rd patrol.
The U-boat sailed from Lorient once more on 16 January 1943 and headed across the Atlantic to the northern coast of South America. On 9 March at 03:00, "U-510" attacked Convoy BT-6 about north-east of Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana, sinking the 3,872 ton British merchant ship "Kelvinbank", and damaging the 7,176 ton American Liberty ships "George G. Meade", "Tabitha Brown" and "Joseph Rodman Drake". She attacked the same convoy again three hours later and this time damaged the Liberty ships "Mark Hanna", "James Smith", "Thomas Ruffin" and "James K. Polk", the latter two so badly that they were later declared total losses. The U-boat returned to Lorient on 16 April.
4th patrol.
Now under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Alfred Eick, "U-510" sailed from Lorient on 3 June 1943 and once again headed for the northern South American coast.

The U-boat then shaped a course for Penang in Malaya (now Malaysia), making three more attacks en route. On 7 March she torpedoed and sank the unescorted 7,229 ton Norwegian merchant ship "Tarifa" about 250 miles east of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. On 19 March she sank the American 7,176 ton Liberty ship "John A.

Prince Hassan was Minister of the Interior and "de facto" head of the Government of the Sultanate of the Maldives. "U-510" arrived at Penang on 5 April after a voyage of 155 days, her longest patrol.
6th patrol.
Operating as part of the "Monsun Gruppe" the U-boat sailed to Singapore, then to Kobe, Japan, before returning to Batavia (now Jakarta). From there, on 26 November 1944, she sailed on her only combat patrol, returning to Batavia on 3 December having had no successes.

Post war.
"U-510" was captured by American forces at Saint-Nazaire on 10 May 1945. Awarded to the French in 1946, she was commissioned into the French Navy, and renamed "Bouan" (S.612) on 24 June 1947. She served until struck on 1 May 1959, renamed hull "Q.176" on 23 November 1959, and was broken up in 1960.

<doc id="18674065" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18674065" title="Richard Sharpe (actor)">
Richard Sharpe (actor)

Richard Sharpe (c. 1602 [?] – January 1632) was an actor with the King's Men, the leading theatre troupe of its time and the company of William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage. Sharpe began his career as a boy player acting female roles, then switched to male roles in his young adulthood.
"The Duchess of Malfi".
Sharpe's earliest known role was, arguably, both his most significant and his most controversial. The first edition of John Webster's "The Duchess of Malfi", printed in 1623, contains the earliest cast list in English Renaissance drama. The list states that Sharpe originated the title role of the Duchess.
The 1623 cast list actually covers two separate productions, the premiere staging and a later revival.
The cast list holds that Sharpe played the Duchess in both of these productions; he would have been perhaps 12 years old for the first, and about 19 for the second (though the dates of both the productions and of Sharpe's birth are not certain). Some commentators blanche at the idea of a 12-year-old boy playing such a prominent woman's role; and some have assigned the part in the first production to the more experienced Richard Robinson, or to Alexander Cooke, the veteran who is thought by some to have originated many Shakespearean heroines. (Cooke, however, died in February 1614, necessitating an earlier date for the original production.)
The subject of boy players in female roles is controversial and long-disputed. A cautious approach would rely on the testimony of the evidentiary record, which assigns the role of the Duchess of Malfi to Sharpe.
Other roles.
Sharpe originated other female roles in ensuing years. the cast lists added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679 credit Sharpe with parts in the King's Men's premiere productions of:
— in the 1616–24 era.
Sharpe "probably became a sharer in the King's Men in 1624" — that is, a partner in the company rather than a mere hired player. Sharpe then switched from important female roles to important male roles — a transition that some boy players (like Robinson or Stephen Hammerton) executed more successfully than others (like John Honyman). Sharpe played Parthenius in the company's production of Philip Massinger's "The Roman Actor" (1626), Ferdinand the general in the same author's "The Picture" (1629), Lysander in Lodowick Carlell's "The Deserving Favourite" (also 1629), Wittworth in John Clavell's "The Soddered Citizen" (1630), and the King of the Lombards in Arthur Wilson's "The Swisser" (1631).
Son.
Parish records testify to the brief existence of Sharpe's illegitimate son Richard; as the record puts it, he was "base born of the body of Margaret Smith singlewoman..." The infant was christened on 6 September 1631, and buried eleven days later, on 17 September; his mother was a servant.
Death.
Sharpe's death followed that of his son by four months; he was buried in the parish of St. Anne Blackfriars on 25 January 1632, aged 30.

Design.
The Weemote was designed for younger children to limit their ability to surf television channels, and also to partially serve as a learning tool. The remote looks like a toy with buttons that are different colors and specific shapes. Each button can be programmed to a specific television channel. There are several variations of the product.
Trademark violation claims against Nintendo.
The term "Weemote" was originally trademarked in 2000 by Fobis Technologies. While spelled differently, the term "Weemote" is phonetically identical to "Wiimote", the unofficial term for the Wii Remote, Nintendo's controller for the Wii which debuted six years later in 2006. Fobis Technologies claims this to be trademark infringement, however Nintendo does not actually use the term "Wiimote" in official promotional materials; many retailers that sell the Wii Remote do use the term. Fobis sent out up to 100 cease and desist letters to retailers and have made offers to Nintendo for them to purchase the trademark. Nintendo declined the offer, stating that it "does not use and does not plan to use the Weemote trademark".

Marvel Zombies 3

Marvel Zombies 3 is a four-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics beginning in October 2008. It is part of the "Marvel Zombies" series. The series is written by Fred Van Lente, penciled by Kev Walker, with covers by Greg Land.
Plot.
Zombies invade Earth-616, the original Marvel Universe, by entering through the Nexus of Realities in Florida. Siege, Jennifer Kale, Wundarr and the Conquistador, local members of the Fifty-State Initiative, investigate but are attacked by zombie Deadpool and a few zombified civilians. The zombies kill the Conquistador, and infect Siege and Wundarr. A horrified Kale destroys Deadpool's body with an airboat. Siege's robotics detect the biological corruption and he self-terminates. Wundarr goes into hibernation to purge himself. A traumatized Jennifer Kale awaits in an observation room back at headquarters.
Back at A.R.M.O.R., Machine Man and Jocasta travel to the Marvel Zombie universe to find DNA with Little Sky so they can find an uninfected human for Morbius, now an A.R.M.O.R. scientist, to make a vaccine against the zombie plague so the 616 heroes can be inoculated against the virus. While the heroes are gone, it is revealed that Morbius is the zombie version, who has kidnapped the real one.
The two heroes find that "human" readings are really coming from clones generated by the zombie Kingpin, via his resources and created by the zombie Jackal, now used as the zombies' sole food source under Kingpin's control. As they watch, the zombified Inhumans arrive and are welcomed by Kingpin.
Machine Man and Jocasta stumble upon Vanessa Fisk, who is uninfected. She tells them that the Kingpin is keeping her safe. She allows Jocasta to get a blood sample, but declines an offer to escape to Earth-616, preferring to stay behind with her husband. Looking at the dead and dying bodies in the pit, Machine Man is overcome with pity, realizing that the zombies are treating the clones the way humans treat robots. He leaves Jocasta, goes into battle mode and destroys the clones out of mercy and gets attacked by the zombies.
Zombie Doctor Strange appears, who only has the powers to create manna (inedible to the zombies) and to see other dimensions. He reveals A.R.M.O.R.'s operations on Earth-616. Machine Man sees that the impostor Morbius used Deadpool to create a distraction so that he could set his plans in motion.
On the real Marvel Universe, a female team member finds the real Morbius captive. The infected version attacks and turns her, causing a zombie outbreak that quickly overtakes the entire facility. Little Sky returns Jocasta to A.R.M.O.R. without Machine Man, who didn't meet them on time, and Jocasta requests that Machine Man be given posthumous honors. Jocasta discovers Morbius is a zombie, and one zombie uses the A.R.M.O.R. teleporters to escape this reality.
In the zombie universe, Machine Man defeats the zombies, leaving only zombie Lockjaw, who Machine Man uses to teleport back to A.R.M.O.R., then he kills the zombies. The real Morbius escapes and kills zombie Morbius.
Jocasta and Machine Man return to S.H.I.E.L.D., and Morbius volunteers to follow the zombie that teleported away, along with a new team of Midnight Sons.
Sequel.
The end of the final issue sets-up the next part of the Marvel Zombies saga "Marvel Zombies 4: Midnight Sons".
Covers.
Unlike the prior Marvel Zombies series covers, which were zombie variations of past Marvel comics covers, Marvel Zombies 3 covers are variants of well known movie posters. Art by Greg Land.
The variant cover for issue #1 is an Arthur Suydam Zombie version of Machine Man #1, originally by Jack Kirby.
The second printing of #1 features a variant cover by Kev Walker, using story art from the issue.
Reception.
Paul Brian Gomez Parra reviewed the first issue for Comics Bulletin and was happy with the story although he knocked off half a point for the ending. The writing is "briskly paced, humorous, and loaded with references that makes me think we read the same comics growing up" according to McCoy, who said it measures up well against its predecessors, suggesting that it is "rough-hewn and hearkens back to Philips' work on the previous series, but lacks the detailed gore of those stories". Timothy Callahan at Comic Book Resources agrees, stating that Van Lente's writing "balances the sick humor with an engaging plot, providing a few twists and turns in just a single issue" and Walker's contribution is "streamlined an effective, with a kind of blocky Steve Dillon vibe."
Collected editions.
The series has been collected into an individual volume:

Edwin Corboy

Edwin Wilkie "Ted" Corboy (24 August 1896 – 6 August 1950) was an Australian politician. From 1918 until 2010 Corboy held the record as the youngest ever Australian Member of Parliament. 
Early life.
Born in Victoria, he was educated in Western Australia at Perth Boys' School, and enlisted for military service in June 1915, after having previously been rejected. He served at Gallipoli and later in France, where he was wounded twice, first at Pozieres and later at Flers, before being invalided to England because of injury to his eyes, the result of a gas attack. On his return to Western Australia in May 1917, he worked as a clerk in the records branch of the Western Australian Lands Department and was an active member of the Labour Party.
Political career.
Federal politics.
Corboy unsuccessfully contested the seat of Subiaco in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly before being elected to the Australian House of Representatives in the 1918 by-election for the seat of Swan. He won the by-election in somewhat unusual circumstances, winning the safe Nationalist seat for the Labour Party. The conservative vote was split because two conservative parties, the Nationalists and the Country Party, both contested the election. Corboy, received the highest number of primary votes and won the "first past the post" contest. This unexpected outcome led to the introduction of preferential voting in Australia. Corboy, who was 22 when he was elected, became the youngest person ever elected to the House of Representatives and held that record until Wyatt Roy, aged 20, won the Division of Longman in the 2010 federal election.
Corboy made his maiden House of Representatives speech in November 1918, during a parliamentary debate on the Defence Bill. "The Argus" reported that Corboy "disagreed with the idea of allowing courts-martial to try soldiers for murder and to punish them with death." The newspaper further reported that Corboy spoke clearly and with confidence, creating a good impression. In 1919, Corboy was censured by the central executive of the Victorian branch of the Labour party for supporting the deportation of all aliens interned during World War I from Australia. The executive, in condemning Corboy, claimed his stance was "inconsistent with principles of liberty and justice". Corboy, who was active in representing the interests of repatriated and demobilised veterans, had expressed concern that jobs in Western Australia's timber industry were being filled with Austrians released from internment and returning to their old jobs, while returned soldiers were not able to obtain work. 
Corboy was a state delegate to the federal executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League (RSSIL), a predecessor of the Returned Services League and in 1919 attended the RSSIL's fourth annual conference in Adelaide. In June 1919, Corboy made a speech to dock workers, following a period of industrial unrest, including riots, at the Fremantle wharf. He called for a federal election and stated that he would "a thousand times rather have been wounded in a wharf riot in Fremantle than fighting for the capitalistic rulers of the world in France". The comments were strongly criticised by the Kalgoorlie branch of the Returned Soldiers' Association, who called for his replacement as a Western Australian delegate to the federal executive of the RSSIL. 
In the 1919 Australian federal election, Corboy again stood for the seat of Swan, where he won the primary vote but was defeated on preferences by the Country Party's John Prowse.
Western Australian state politics.
After his defeat in 1919, Corboy remained involved in Labour politics and in 1919 was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly as the member for Yilgarn. In 1921, Corboy supported Edith Cowan in voicing disagreement with a policy allowing only male guests to the Speaker's gallery. Corboy was a member of the parliamentary select committee appointed to inquire into the cashing out of soldiers' war gratuity bonds. In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime. Capital punishment was only formally abolished in Western Australia in 1984.
In 1930, Corboy became the member for Yilgarn-Coolgardie, a new seat incorporating his former seat, after a challenge to the validity of his election was dismissed. He did not contest the 1933 Western Australian state election.
After politics.
In 1939 Corboy was again called to military service, serving until 1945, when he returned to Australia and worked as a public servant in Perth. He died in on 6 August 1950.

Columbus Philharmonic Orchestra

The Columbus Philharmonic Orchestra was a symphony orchestra of the United States, located in Columbus, Ohio. Founded in 1941 and disbanded in 1949, the Columbus Philharmonic was the first professional symphony orchestra in Columbus and was a precursor to the present Columbus Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's music director was the American conductor Izler Solomon.
History.
The orchestra was founded in 1941 and presented concerts in Franklin County Memorial Hall (now the Franklin County Board of Elections building). Originally the orchestra was semi-professional with all of its principal chairs occupied by full-time professional players. Many of these musicians were imported to Columbus from Chicago, Cleveland and elsewhere due to a shortage of local players during World War II. In 1946, it became a full-time professional orchestra, the first in Columbus. In 1949 the fledgling eight-year-old orchestra was disbanded by its board of trustees due to an inability to continue raising the funds necessary to produce its concerts.
The orchestra's concerts were broadcast several times nationally on the NBC Radio network. Live recordings preserving the sound of the Philharmonic exist, having been made during concerts by Robert Buchsbaum's local recording company, Coronet Records. Buchsbaum was also the orchestra's principal oboist. One of these, Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 with Artur Schnabel as soloist, was issued on CD by the Pearl label in 1995.
The music director during the entire life of the Columbus Philharmonic was Izler Solomon. Solomon later became music director of the Indianapolis Symphony.
In 1951, the Philharmonic's former concertmaster, George Hardesty, started the Columbus Little Symphony. From this group evolved the present Columbus Symphony Orchestra.

1978 San Francisco 49ers season

The 1978 San Francisco 49ers season was their 29th season in the National Football League. The team began the season hoping to improve upon their previous output of 5–9. Instead, the team started the season 0–4 for the second straight year. The team also suffered a nine game losing streak. 
During the off-season, the 49ers acquired running back O.J. Simpson from Buffalo. Although Simpson had been one of the best backs in the league over the previous decade, he was in poor physical condition and had recently undergone knee surgery. As a result, his playing ability was limited. 
The 49ers finished with the worst record in the league and scored only 219 points the fewest in the league in 1978. The team set an NFL record with 63 turnovers.

UAAP Season 69 men's basketball tournament

The men's basketball tournaments of UAAP Season 69 (A.Y. 2006-07) started on July 8, 2006 at the Araneta Coliseum and ended on October 2, 2006 also at the same venue with the UST Growling Tigers defeating the Ateneo Blue Eagles in the third game of their Finals series. Ateneo finished first in the elimination round. They eliminated the Adamson Soaring Falcons, who are in their Final Four debut, in the semifinals. UST finished tied for third in the eliminations and had to beat the 2nd seed UE Red Warriors twice in order to qualify at the Finals.
2005 losing finalists De La Salle Green Archers were suspended when it was revealed that two players used spurious documents to enter college. All of their wins from 2003 to 2005 were also forfeited. La Salle's suspension also caused the suspension of the 2005 juniors champions De La Salle Junior Archers. All La Salle teams would return in the 2007 season.
Preseason events.
In a meeting held at Adamson University on April 21, 2006, the UAAP Board unanimously voted to suspend De La Salle from all UAAP events on both divisions for the 2006–2007 (69th) season due to negligence.
New coaches include the comebacking Joe Lipa for the UP Fighting Maroons, Leo Austria for the Adamson Falcons, and Pido Jarencio for the UST Growling Tigers.
Since Joe Lipa was tapped as the new coach of UP, Elmer Yanga, former team manager of the RFM franchise in the Philippine Basketball Association, was chosen as the new basketball commissioner for the season.
All of the elimination's first round games after Opening Day was held at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium in Malate, Manila. Second round games were held at the Philsports Arena and the Araneta Coliseum. The Final Four and the best-of-three Finals are set at the Big Dome as well.
Elimination round.
Host team in boldface.
Tiebreaker: UST defeats Adamson on the playoff for the 3rd seed, 85–71.
FEU Tamaraws.
At the end of the elimination round, the FEU Tamaraws, with team captain and eventual PBA superstar Jonas Villanueva, became the first defending champions in league history not to make it into the Final Four, under the same coach, Bert Flores, who was then replaced by Glenn Capacio for the following season. They lost a chance for the #4 spot to Ateneo, through JC Intal's drive that gave the Blue Eagles the win. Flores became an assistant coach in Season 70.
Rivalry games.
These are the results of the different rivalry games:
Postseason teams.
Adamson make their first Final Four appearance since the format's first application in 1994. Ateneo and UE continue their streaks of playoff appearances, as UST returns after a three-year absence. The FEU Tamaraws were the first defending champions not to qualify for the semifinals.
Ateneo Blue Eagles.
The Eagles entered the season as one of the preseason favorites. After winning a nailbiter against lowly NU Bulldogs on Opening Day, the Eagles went on an 8-game winning streak, sweeping the first round, and surviving squeakers against Adamson and FEU, and blowing out UST by 36 points, 114–78 on the first round finale through a high scoring second quarter.
The second round was more of the same, when Ateneo again survived another 1-point game against the Falcons. However, they were dealt with their first setback in an overtime loss against the Growling Tigers, who were without three players due to injuries and ailments. Despite the loss, the Eagles were already assured of a twice-to-beat advantage at the semi-finals. They also dropped their last assignment, a no-bearing game against the Warriors at the last day of eliminations.
UE Red Warriors.
Returning with an intact lineup, the hosts also emerged as one of the preseason tournaments. However, the first round was mixed, as they were beaten by UST and Ateneo, but they finished second.
On the second round, UE was unbeaten, winning four straight (including the last game of the first round). However, UE was beaten by Adamson in an overtime thriller. After UST's victory of Adamson in the game, UE is now assured of a twice-to-beat advantage at the semifinals.
UST Growling Tigers.
The Growling Tigers opened the season with a stunning loss against the UP Fighting Maroons on a buzzer-beater shot by Marvin Cruz. However, they beat the defending champions Far Eastern and top seeds East in two closely fought games. With setbacks against National, Adamson and a blowout loss against Ateneo, their Final Four aspirations were cast in doubt.
Santo Tomas opened their second round with another loss against UE. But they broke the .500 barrier with successive wins against National, Far Eastern, and an overtime win against Ateneo. Flirting a possible twice-to-beat advantage at the semifinals, the Maroons dealt the Tigers another defeat. With their fates not in their hands, they've beaten the Soaring Falcons in a tightly contested game. With Ateneo's drubbing of Far Eastern, the Tigers entered the Final Four for the first time since 2002.
Adamson Soaring Falcons.
The Falcons is the only team not to enter the men's Final Four since the league instituted it in 1994. Seeking to end the streak, the Falcons had their first win against the Bulldogs, after being demolished by the hosts in their opening game. But Adamson still faced a rocky ride, losing to top contenders, Ateneo and FEU but beating UP and UST to end the first round with an even 3–3 record.
Opening the second round, Adamson was beaten again by FEU and Ateneo. But with center Ken Bono posting MVP numbers, Adamson brought itself in the hunt for that elusive Final Four berth. They were able to demolish UP and upset UE in overtime. They lost to UST before closing out the second round with a win over NU. With Ateneo's defeat of Far Eastern, Adamson barged outright into their first Final Four appearance.
Semifinals.
Ateneo-Adamson series.
This was the Soaring Falcons' first Final Four appearance. Adamson gave Ateneo two one-point victories in the elimination round, with the Eagles escaping due to their endgame heroics.
A see-saw game until the fourth quarter, when Ken Bono of the Falcons converting a three-point play with 18.3 seconds remaining, to cut the Ateneo lead to, 74–73. On the inbound pass, Blue Eagle Chris Tiu threw an errant pass to Macky Escalona who failed to retrieve it. On the next possession, Soaring Falcon Patrick Cabahug missed a fadeaway jumper, which led to an Atenean rebound. The Falcons left with no choice but to foul Chris Tiu, who calmly sank his two freethrows, thereby eliminating the Falcons from contention.
UE-UST series.
Season host was favored in this matchup, with several veterans in the lineup. The Tigers have no players with playoff experience, save for Jemal Vizcarra who was out of the season by the second game due to an Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.
UST won the first game 91–77, while UE won the second game, 74–63 in the elimination round. UE's loss was the third time in tournament history where they were booted out of the semifinals armed with the twice-to-beat advantage (1994, 2002 and 2006). UE's last Finals appearance was on 1991.
First game.
UST led for much of the game, when the Warriors started making inroads by the third quarter. With 21.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, and with UST up by two points, June Cortez of UST converted a three-point play that gave the Growling Tigers enough breathing space to force a deciding elimination game.
Second game.
With the Tigers off to a hot start, the Warriors kept within striking distance. In the fourth quarter, the Warriors forced a 70-all deadlock - the first in the game. UE then led by as much as five points, but the Tigers fought back, forcing turnovers and grabbing offensive rebounds, to tie the score at 79-all. After a UE turnover, Jojo Duncil missed the shot, but Jervy Cruz grabbed the offensive rebound, missing the put-back; Duncil then tipped in the ball for a two-point field goal, plus a foul. Duncil completed the three-point play. On the next possession, UE's Marcy Arellano drove unmolested to the basket, cutting the lead into one point. With a UST turnover and several seconds remaining, Red Warrior Jorel Cañizares missed a medium range jump shot. Cañizares grabbed his own rebound but missed on a short stab; Warriors team captain Robert Labagala grabbed the rebound as time expired.
Finals.
The Growling Tigers and the Blue Eagles met each other for the first time in the UAAP Finals. The last time they met in the Finals was in the 1931 NCAA season, in which the Ateneo won.
Game One.
The game was close all throughout, with neither team leading by double figures. It ended in the fourth quarter with two crucial plays. With 4.3 seconds to go, Tigers forward Allan Evangelista made a tough fadeaway shot over the outstreched arms of Doug Kramer, pushing UST ahead of Ateneo, 72–71, with 1 second to go.
Ateneo coach Norman Black immediately called a time-out over the tumultuous din of the rejoicing UST fans. In the inbound play, Macky Escalona found a wide open Doug Kramer on the paint, and the Ateneo forward calmly banked the ball in for the win, sending the Ateneo fans, in turn, into a wild frenzy.
Game Two.
The Eagles, although led early, were down by a point at the end of the first half. The Tigers broke the zone defense by hitting outside shots and by grabbing offensive rebounds off their misses. JC Intal kept the Eagles at striking distance but his supporting cast wasn't enough as the Tigers cruised into a Game 2 victory, and forced a winner-take-all Game 3.
Game Three.
With a tightly contested first quarter, the Intal-Escalona connection of the Eagles threatened to pull away at the second quarter, leading by as much as ten. In the third quarter, the Tigers stormed back, keeping in touch with the Blue Eagles. In the dying minutes of the fourth quarter, rookie sensation Jervy Cruz fouled out with 1:16 left; Evangelista, the almost-hero of Game 1, fouled out two minutes earlier. With a 64–59 Ateneo lead, Anthony Espiritu scored a three-pointer on the UST offense. Mark Canlas scored a put-back to tie the game. Intal missed a short jumper at the other end for force overtime.
With the score tied 74-all, June Cortez missed a jumper; Dylan Ababou was fouled as he grabbed the rebound. Ababou split his charities, which led to another JC Intal miss in the final seconds. The rebound was hotly contested, and the referee called for a jump ball; the possession arrow pointed to UST. Eric Salamat was forced to foul June Cortez, who converted his first and missed his second, which led to the Ateneo rebound with 3.6 ticks left. Jai Reyes heaved a desperation three-pointer that missed the ring completely, causing jubilation to the golden half of the Coliseum. An estimated 20,000 packed the Araneta Coliseum including United States Ambassador to the Philippines Kristie Kenney and Senator Richard Gordon . 
Jojo Duncil was named Finals MVP award. Pido Jarencio won his first UAAP title for UST.

Permatang Pauh by-election, 2008

A by-election was held for the Dewan Rakyat parliamentary seat of Permatang Pauh on August 26, 2008 with nomination day on August 16, 2008. The seat of Permatang Pauh in the Dewan Rakyat, fell vacant after the resignation of the incumbent, Datuk Seri Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, on 31 July 2008. Wan Azizah was the Leader of the Opposition as well as the President of the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), a component party of the opposition Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition. The by-election was contested by the PR candidate former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This election has been dubbed "the mother of all by-elections" by the media due to the potentially significant implication of the election as well as the high profile of Anwar Ibrahim.
Anwar won the election and was sworn into Parliament on August 28, 2008, vowing to topple the government with the help of defectors from Barisan Nasional.
Background of the by-election.
On July 27, 2008, Anwar said that he aimed to return to parliament for the first time in a decade later this year if a court ordered a by-election near his home town. The seat mentioned would probably be Kulim-Bandar Baharu constituency next to his hometown of Permatang Pauh in Penang. Anwar Ibrahim on July 31, 2008 said he would contest a by-election for the parliamentary seat of Permatang Pauh vacated by his wife in order to expedite his return to political office. His wife Wan Azizah said she handed her letter of resignation to the parliament speaker on Thursday 31 July. Party officials said the by-election must be held within 60 days. The Election Commission (EC) had fixed the nomination day for the Permatang Pauh by-election on August 16, with polling to be held ten days later on August 26. Some 58,459 voters in the Permatang Pauh constituency would be eligible to vote on August 26, a working Tuesday, adding that the figure also include 490 postal voters.
Anwar Ibrahim was charged on August 7, 2008 for sodomy under Section 377B of the Penal Code, fueling speculations over a possible conspiracy on the part of the Malaysian government to derail his election campaign.
Background of Permatang Pauh.
Parliamentary seat P.44 Permatang Pauh lies in the federal state of Penang. In the 2008 election, Datuk Seri Wan Azizah Wan Ismail of the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (a component party of the Pakatan Rakyat coalition), garnered 30,338 votes, defeating Firdaus Ismail of the United Malay National Organization (UMNO) (a component party of the Barisan Nasional coalition) (16,950 votes) .
Nominations.
Ibrahim said: "Barisan Nasional is clearly overwhelmed. It's no longer a by-election. It's more than that." Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak admitted the ruling party was the underdog: "It is going to be an uphill task but nothing is impossible in politics."
By-election results.
Early results indicated a landslide victory for Anwar. Reuters reported "Anwar Ibrahim has won with a majority of 16,210 votes. According to news website Malaysiakini: Anwar won 26,646 votes, while the government's Arif Omar won 10,436 votes. Anwar's People's Justice Party spokeswoman Ginie Lim told BBC: "We won already. We are far ahead."
Malaysia's government and ruling coalition declared defeat in a landslide victory in by-election by Anwar Ibrahim. Muhammad Muhammad Taib, information chief of the United Malays National Organisation which leads the Barisan Nasional coalition stated: “Yes of course we have lost . . . we were the underdogs going into this race.“ Malaysia's Election Commission officials announced Anwar won by an astounding majority against Arif Shah Omar Shah of United Malays National Organisation and over Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi.
Final results announced by the Election Commission reveals Anwar Ibrahim won 31,195 of the estimated 47,000 votes cast in the district in the northern state of Penang, while rival Arif Shah Omar Shah got only 15,524 votes and a third candidate had 92 votes.

BlastOff! Corporation

Blastoff! Corporation was a small aerospace company in Pasadena, California that operated from 1999 to early 2001. Blastoff! was one of dozens of Idealab's incubator companies, created to capitalize on the public interest in space travel and exploration.
Summary.
The company Blastoff! Corporation was first formed as Spacelab in 1999, but was quickly renamed to Blastoff! to differentiate it from the NASA Spacelab Space Shuttle module. The company was developed and acted in secret throughout its short existence.
The company’s mission was to do entertainment space missions: flights that would pay for themselves through the sales of advertising, media content, action figures, etc. thus, Blastoff! differed from other companies espousing similar goals in that it was decided not to promote its development work and that Blastoff!’s first mission was fully funded.
Blastoff!'s first mission rapidly evolved from an initial concept of human space tourism to its final plan of sending a robotic lander/rover to the Moon. The size of the company grew from less than ten employees in January 2000, to a peak of approximately 59 full-time employees in October 2000. Due to funding constraints, the company effectively closed down in January 2001.
Participants.
The approximately 50 direct employees of Blastoff! came from different aerospace and non-aerospace backgrounds across the United States. Approximately 35 of the employees were engineers, with backgrounds from both small and large aerospace organizations. Other employees were responsible for financing, marketing, and famously the cinematography organization of the mission (this included recognizable Hollywood directors and producers). Many well-known aerospace companies were enlisted as subcontractors to provide most of the subsystems on the spacecraft.
L1 Mission.
The only concept mission at Blastoff! was to send a robotic lander/rover spacecraft to the Moon. This mission was named Lunar 1, or L1 for short. The robotic element of the mission had three parts: a Rover, and two smaller Scouts. The L1 mission was to follow a direct lunar injection trajectory, rather than performing several Earth orbits prior to performing an engine fire to leave orbit. The launch vehicle contracted for the L1 mission was the last of the Athena series (prior to Athena's reactivation in 2010).
The Rover contained all of the hardware necessary to navigate to the Moon, execute a soft landing on its surface, move overland to its destination, and communicate with the Earth throughout the entire mission. The Rover was similar in size to the two NASA rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) that successfully landed on Mars in January 2004, and had similar mobility functionality.
The Scouts acted as remote extensions of the main Rover craft, and contained power systems, video cameras and limited local communication systems that could only communicate directly with the Rover. The Scouts were about six by twelve inches and were deployed from the Rover after the Rover performed a soft landing on the surface of the Moon. The Scouts could be used in a reconnaissance function to identify upcoming travel hazards, and also performed a "third person" video perspective to show the Rover itself on the surface of the Moon.
The destination of the Rover and Scouts was one of the NASA Apollo landing sites, most likely the Apollo 11 landing site (the first manned landing on the Moon). The mission was designed to land the Rover and Scouts as close to the Apollo site as possible at the beginning of that site's local lunar day. This would provide a two-week time period with continuous sunlight to power the Rover and Scouts before the two-week lunar night would effectively end the mission by causing the batteries to drain. Throughout this two-week period daytime period, the Rover and Scouts' location would be identified relative to the Apollo site, and the robotic craft would be remotely driven from the Earth to arrive at the Apollo site prior to lunar nightfall.
The L1 mission and hardware design was developed and finalized throughout a very intense engineering effort in 2000. A similarly intense targeted marketing and funding campaign also took place during this time, but without adequate results to maintain company liquidity. A majority of the hardware to build the system had been ordered, and some had been received by the time the company shut down in January 2001. The L1 project was not perpetuated after the company's shutdown, and so the Rover and Scouts never were completed and launched.

The Varaha was also called the Hon, Gadyana or a Pon and came in the Ghattivaraha, Doddavaraha and Suddhavaraha coin. In the gold issue the different coins came in Varaha, this is used as a reference for the other coins values. 1 gold Varaha = 2 Pratapas = 4 Katis = 8 Chinna = 4 Haga = 2 Bele. 1 Pana or Varana equaled 16 tara silver coin, with the 1 Tara to 3 copper Jital.

Western Australian state election, 1897

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia between 27 April and 26 May 1897 to elect 44 members to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. The Ministerialist group led by John Forrest won a third term in office as a result of the elections. The poll took place based on boundaries established in the "Constitution Act Amendment Act 1896", which increased the number of members from 33 mainly by adding new seats in the Goldfields region, and had been called a year earlier than was necessary. In 18 of the 44 seats, only one candidate nominated and polls were not held.
As payment of members was not introduced until 1900, the Political Labour Party, formed in 1896, had found it difficult to attract candidates who could afford to enter Parliament, but three of its candidates ran for election, and Charles Oldham, a former president of the Trades and Labor Council, became the first Labour member of Parliament in Western Australia.

<doc id="18674624" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18674624" title="Einheitsdampflokomotive">
Einheitsdampflokomotive

The German term Einheitsdampflokomotive, sometimes shortened to "Einheitslokomotive" or "Einheitslok", means standard steam locomotive and refers to the steam engines built in Germany after 1925 under the direction of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft. Their manufacture made extensive use of standard design features and components.
Development.
Following the merger of the state railways ("Länderbahnen") in Germany into the Reich railway in 1920 and into the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft in 1924, the locomotive fleet of the new national railway administration still had 210 different types and classes of steam engine. This considerably hindered the flexible employment of locomotives within the railway network, and servicing and maintenance was very costly as a result of the large number of different spare parts that had to be stocked. In addition, production tolerances of individual components were so small that, often, even components for the same class of locomotive could only be used after further finishing work had been carried out. 
On top of that, substantial reparations as a result of the First World War, 1914–18, considerably reduced the rolling stock of the German railways without regard to the variety of classes. Thus out of the 33,000 locomotives in the fleet (as at 1917), 8,000 had to be handed over. There was therefore a need to build new locomotives and to introduce a sensible degree of standardisation in procuring these new engines.
To that end a locomotive standards committee was convened by the Reichsbahn. Even representatives of the locomotive industry took part in this standardisation process. Initially the question was posed as to whether proven state railway classes should continue to be built or whether new, modern locomotives should be developed and ordered. Because the basic concepts for the new locomotives had not been decided, however, and in order to give the locomotive factories follow-on orders, it was decided in 1921 to continue to build proven state railway classes to begin with. These classes were given new Reichsbahn classifications. Amongst them were the Prussian P 8 (Class 38.10), the Prussian P 10 (Class 39), the Prussian G 12 (Class 58.10) and the Prussian T 20 (Class 95), all of which continued to be manufactured until 1925. The Bavarian S 3/6 (Class 18.5) was even procured right up to 1930. The Prussian G 12 (Class 58.10), which was not developed until 1917, effectively counted as the first German "Einheitslok", because it was employed by almost all the state railways and built by several locomotive factories across the whole Reich.
Technical and economic factors, as well as the Reichsbahn's aim of improving main lines to handle a standard axle load of 20 tons, led to the decision to develop new types of locomotive. After heated debates in the locomotive committee (e.g. about the design of the boilers and fireboxes as well as the choice between two-cylinder layouts or four-cylinder compounds), the design principles and a programme for the development of standard Deutsche Reichsbahn locomotive classes emerged, of which the first were built in 1925. Playing a decisive role in these discussions was the head of the Grunewald Locomotive Research Office at that time, Richard Paul Wagner.
In fact the production of engines in the desired quantities could not be achieved at first, both for economic reasons and due to delays in the improvement of routes to take the higher axle loads. Of the classes with a 20 ton axle load - 01, 02, 43 and 44 - only small pre-production numbers were procured at first. Up to the end of the 1930s the state railway classes, taken over or re-ordered by the Reichsbahn, dominated the scene, in particular those of Prussian stock. The delay to the upgrade of routes also meant that additional classes with lower axle loads had to be developed, e.g. the classes 03 and 50. 
In spite of the Deutsche Reichsbahn's ambitious plans, their actual acquisition of locomotives, even from 1925 onwards, only reached about one tenth of the average procurement quantities for the years 1914-1920 and it remained at this level until 1938. The causes of this were the world wide economic crises and the resulting reduction in demand for Reichsbahn's railway services. Not until 1930 was the 500th standard locomotive built (2% of the total fleet), in 1934 the 1000th engine was delivered (4% of the total) and in 1938 there were 1,500 "Einheitsloks" in existence (6% of the total). 
Not until 1939 did the procurement quantities rise significantly. With the introduction of a production programme for simpler goods train locomotive designs, that led into the construction of the war locomotives (the "Kriegsloks"), engines with an axle load of 15 tons were built in significant quantities. Now, however, there was a different objective: supporting the conduct of the war. So by 1945 the total number of standard and war locomotives had climbed to about 14,500 (33% of the total fleet).
This state of affairs stood in stark contrast to the image promoted by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, that wanted to give the impression of a modern railway administration through its railway exhibitions, record speed runs, the introduction of the "SVT" network and proud photographic news reports. In fact the low level of procurement was responsible for the fact that the average age of the locomotive fleet continued to rise in the years from 1925 to 1938.
Design Principles of the "Einheitslokomotiven".
In many cases, rivetted, sheet steel, locomotive frames were used on the older steam locomotives as a support for the running gear and engine. For reasons of stability, this frame had to be of a certain height. To meet the increasing demands in performance on the newer engines, a larger boiler was required, for which there was not enough room for the high-sided sheet metal frame. As a result the new "Einheitslokomotiven" had a lower and more solid bar frame. In addition, the higher performance demanded, required a larger boiler heating area; this was achieved by extending the boiler barrel.
The use of individual components or systems such as, for example, the boiler, the carrying bogies, etc., for as many classes as possible, enabled considerable savings to be achieved in construction, in repair and in the stocks of spares parts needed.
So, just externally, German "Einheitsdampflokomotiven" can be recognised from their bar frame, their large, long boilers and corresponding short chimneys, the standardised appearance of systems like the bogies, driver's cabs and associated tenders, as well as the typical, large "Wagner" smoke deflectors and, later, the smaller and more elegant "Witte" deflectors in front of the smokestacks. 
Numerous improvements and optimisations were carried out on the new designs. For example, in the boiler, the heating areas and tube cross-sections were more carefully matched to one another to make best use of heat generation. At the same time the flow of smoke gases was optimised by the superheater tube system to minimise suction draught. The low position of the blast pipe in the larger smokebox at the front of the boiler is the least visible feature of the "Einheitslokomotiven".
Type Diversification.
The Reichsbahn tried to have the fewest possible number of locomotive classes in operation and to make maximum use of the permitted axle loads, which were dependent on the type of track bed. The sequence of construction for the "Einheitsloks" was driven by operational requirements and the age of the state railway classes to be replaced.
Express and Passenger Train Locomotives.
As a result after 1925, the DRG Class 01, two-cylinder, express train locomotive emerged first, with a power of about 2,200 PS and 4-6-2 wheel arrangement. It was intended to relieve the DRG Class 17s, that consisted mainly of Prussian S 10s, Saxon XII Hs and Bavarian S 3/5s with their four-cylinder, superheated, compound configuration and 4-6-0 wheel arrangement. With a power of about 1,500 PS and top speeds of around 110 km/h, they no longer met the operating requirements.
The Class 02 was an attempt to produce an "Einheitslok" with a 4-cylinder, superheated compound engine. The state railways had had early and positive experience with this configuration, their engines being grouped into Reichsbahn classes 17 (4-6-0, 2´C h4v), 18.3, 18.4-5 (4-6-2, 2’C1’ h4v) and 19 (2-8-2, 1´D1´ h4v). In spite of its higher power and lower fuel consumption, however, higher maintenance costs meant that the Class 02 did not go into full production. Even the ten express train locomotives that were procured were later converted to two-cylinder engines.
After 1930, it was followed by the Class 03, which was a locomotive for light express trains on routes with rails designed for lower loads (maximum axle loads of 18 tons and locomotive powers of about 2,000 PS). The first pilot tests for high speed locomotives were carried out on this engine, and demonstrated that the riding qualities of a 2-cylinder locomotive at 140 km/h were still good. 
The development of high speed engines continued in 1935 with the appearance of the Class 05 locomotive, which was also designed to standard locomotive principles, although only 3 examples were produced. The Class 05 was permitted to travel regularly at a top speed of 175 km/h and set the world speed record for steam engines of 200 km/h. This record was later officially beaten by the English "Mallard", a LNER Class A4 locomotive, although criticism was expressed at the time that this took place on a descent and that the locomotive did not survive the record journey without damage. 
Just two examples of the Class 06, a still larger locomotive with a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement and a permitted top speed of 140 km/h, were built, because this class was unconvincing in terms of its riding qualities and the boiler characteristics.
In 1937 variants of classes 01 and 03 were developed with three cylinders as the Class 01.10 and Class 03.10. The third cylinder was located in the middle between the outer cylinders and its connecting rod drove the cranked first driving axle. Together with the setting of the side and centre cranks on the wheel circumference, this gave a quieter ride and the higher number of piston strokes per wheel rotation produced a higher acceleration that met the demands of express services. On delivery these engines were fitted with streamlined shells. These were later removed for maintenance reasons, initially in the area of the running gear and then completely, after the end of the war, particularly as the expected improvement in tractive effort at speeds of over 140 km/h turned out to be less than expected.
For branch line operations, the 2-6-0 Class 24 passenger train locomotive was developed in 1926 with an axle load of 15 tons and 920 PS. Nicknamed "Steppenpferd" ("prairie horse"), it was aimed at duties in East Prussia. As a tender locomotive it was intended for long journeys with a top speed of 90 km/h as well as for light fast trains ("Eilzüge"). From this locomotive a tank engine variant, the 2-6-2 Class 64, was developed for shuttle services on shorter routes. The 4-6-4 Class 62 locomotive was built for short main lines with numerous turn-arounds (termini). It had a top speed of 100 km/h.
Goods Train Locomotives and Shunters.
Because the improvement and replacement of the typical, former state railway, goods train locomotives such as the Prussian G 8.3 and G 8.2 would be necessary, standard goods train engines were procured too. First to appear after 1925 were the two-cylinder 2-10-0 locomotives of Class 43 and the three-cylinder Class 44s, each with a 20 ton axle load. As part of the drive towards standardisation, many components, such as the boilers, were largely identical with those of the Class 01. The Class 85 was built as a 2-10-2 tank locomotive variant in 1932. 
In 1928 the lighter 2-8-2 Class 86 tank engines arrived with a 15 ton axle load, as well as the 2-6-2 Class 64 tank locomotives (many parts being identical to those of the Class 24) for passenger and goods traffic on branch lines.
The 2-8-2 Class 41 goods train locomotive (many of whose parts were the same as those of the Class 03) was designed for fast goods trains, e.g. for the transportation of fish and fruit. With its 1,600 mm wheel diameter it could reach a top speed of 90 km/h. That put it within the range of light express train duties, for which it was often used e.g. on the Thuringian Forest lines (e.g. to Meiningen from Arnstadt and Eisenach). Other engines built to standard designs, albeit in smaller numbers, appeared from 1936 in the shape of the heavy and especially powerful 2-10-2 Class 45 goods train locomotives. In order to raise performance and improve economy, the boiler pressure on the Class 45, and other classes, was increased to 20 bar experimentally. However the steel boiler used and the type of steel employed were not up to it, so that the pressure had to be reduced to the usual 16 bar. In many cases, the boilers were later completely replaced.
For shunting duties, the 0-6-0 Class 80 and the 0-8-0 Class 81 locomotive 
emerged in 1926 with a power of 860 PS. 
The ten-coupled Class 87 engines with their two Luttermöller cogwheel axles were built for operations on the very tight curves of Hamburg Harbour's railways. The 16 locomotives of this class were however retired as early as 1954 again because they tended to overheat at higher speeds and could only be used for shunting. As a replacement the Class 82, a new locomotive with Beugniot bogies was used.
Narrow Gauge Engines.
The construction principles used for standard locomotives were also used for newly built narrow gauge engines in order to reduce the cost of servicing and maintenance. 
Initially 32 Class 99.73-76 locomotives were built from 1928 to 1933 for the Saxony narrow gauge railways, with a rail gauge of 750 mm. In 1929 the Class 99.22 was developed for the Prussian, Bavarian, Baden and Württemberg metre gauge railways. However, only 3 examples were built, all fitted with a Class 81 boiler. In 1932 the last narrow gauge "Einheitslok" appeared: the Class 99.32 with a 900 mm rail gauge. Three were built for the "Bäderbahn" ('Spa Line'), the line from Bad Doberan to Kühlungsborn.

Bay of Plenty Times

The Bay of Plenty Times is the regional daily paper for the Bay of Plenty area including Tauranga.
History.
The Bay of Plenty Times is currently one of the New Zealand's largest daily newspapers but for many years its existence was precarious and it came close to folding on a number of occasions.
It was first produced on 4 September 1872 as a bi-weekly publication. It consisted of four pages in tabloid size and cost three pence per issue. The founder and editor was WB Langbridge.
Ownership of the Times changed many times over the next 40 years, including several times through mortgagee sales. Despite the hardships the Times issued a Christmas supplement in 1897, which featured one of the earliest use of photographs in New Zealand newspapers.
From 1913 the paper enjoyed stability after the Gifford and Cross families took over. Both families were associated with the paper until it was sold to Wilson and Horton in 1992. Ownership changed again in 1996 when Independent Newspapers PC from Dublin acquired a controlling interest in Wilson and Horton.
In 1976 a fire destroyed the newspaper's entire collection of back issues. Fortunately the publisher had kept copies on microfilm and these are now held by the Alexander Turnbull Library.
The Times has prospered in the last 50 years and appears secure. Its progress has been linked with that of the Bay of Plenty, which has grown rapidly and continuously since Mt Maunganui became an export port in the early 1950s.
