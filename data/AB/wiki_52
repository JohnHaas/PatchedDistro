Incident at Gaoping Tombs

The Incident at Gaoping Tombs (高平陵之變) in 249 was a coup d'etat that occurred in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history. The parties involved were Cao Shuang and Sima Yi. Sima Yi seized power during the coup and had Cao Shuang killed. The coup increased the Sima clan's power and influence in Wei, thus providing the foundation of the Jin Dynasty.
Background.
In 239, Wei emperor Cao Rui died and was succeeded by the eight-year old Cao Fang. In his final edict, Cao Rui named General-in-Chief Cao Shuang and Grand Commandant Sima Yi as the regents to assist Cao Fang in ruling Wei. Cao Shuang ostracised Sima Yi and placed his close associates such as He Yan, Deng Yang, Li Sheng (李勝), Bi Gui and Ding Mi (丁謐) in high positions in the Wei imperial court. Cao Shuang promoted Sima Yi to the rank of Grand Tutor, which was actually a move by Cao Shuang to place Sima Yi in a powerless position. Cao Shuang also appointed his brothers Cao Xi and Cao Xun (曹訓) in high military ranks. The imperial guards were also under Cao Shuang's command. Cao Shuang and his associates thus controlled the Wei court. Cao Shuang abused his power by indulging in personal entertainment while neglecting state affairs.
Sima Yi was in a powerless position and was thus unable to participate in discussions on state affairs. In 247, he feigned illness to avoid Cao Shuang and ostensibly retired from public life. The next year, when Li Sheng was sent to Jing Province to assume office as the new Inspector, he paid a visit to Sima Yi before his departure. Sima Yi put up a show in front of Li Sheng and pretended that his health had worsened. Sima Yi pretended to have poor hearing and misheard "Jing Province" as "Bing Province". Later, when a servant came to feed him porridge, Sima Yi pretended to cough so badly that the porridge spilt on his clothes. Li Sheng reported Sima Yi's condition to Cao Shuang and Cao Shuang thought that Sima Yi was going to die soon so he lowered his guard. In the meantime, Sima Yi and his sons Sima Shi and Sima Zhao were secretly preparing for a coup to seize power.
Course of events.
In 249, Wei emperor Cao Fang visited the Gaoping Tombs to pay his respects to the late emperor Cao Rui. Cao Shuang, together with his brothers and close associates, followed Cao Fang on the trip. While they were away, Sima Yi seized the opportunity to launch the military coup. He had all the city gates in Luoyang shut on the orders of the empress dowager and he took over the floating bridge at the Luo River as well. He appointed Gao Rou as the acting General-in-Chief and Gao took over command of Cao Shuang's army, while Minister Coachman (太僕) Wang Guan (王觀) was placed in charge of Cao Xi's army. He wrote a report to Cao Fang, asking Cao Fang to remove Cao Shuang and his brothers from power, in the name of the Empress Dowager Guo. Cao Shuang was shocked when he saw the report and was unsure of how to react.
The Minister of Finance Huan Fan managed to flee from Luoyang and went to see Cao Shuang. Huan Fan advised Cao Shuang to move to Xuchang and call for a punitive war against Sima Yi in the name of the emperor. On the other hand, Palace Attendant Xu Yun (許允), Imperial Secretariat Chen Tai and Palace Guard Yin Damu (尹大目) advised Cao Shuang to surrender as soon as possible. Cao Shuang pondered over the issue for a night and finally decided to surrender. He hoped to lead a luxurious life even though he had lost his power. He requested for Cao Fang to strip him off his military post and then he sent Xu Yun and Chen Tai to apologize to Sima Yi on his behalf. Cao Shuang and his brothers returned to their residences after losing their powers.
Aftermath.
After the incident, Zhang Dang (張當) was arrested and he produced a full confession on a plot to overthrow the emperor. Cao Shuang and his associates were accused of treason and arrested and thrown into prison. Huan Fan had earlier met Si Fan (司蕃) during his escape from Luoyang and he told Si Fan, "The Imperial Tutor is planning to rebel, you should come with me!" Si Fan surrendered himself to Sima Yi after that. Sima Yi had Huan Fan arrested and thrown into prison on charges of falsely accusing him of treason instead. Subsequently, Cao Shuang and his associates were executed for treason along with their clans.
Sima Yi successfully seized power during the coup and eliminated the royal faction led by Cao Shuang in the imperial court. He was appointed as chancellor and received the Nine Bestowments from the emperor Cao Fang. Sima Yi's sons Sima Shi and Sima Zhao were placed in high ranking positions in the Wei court as well.
In 251, Wang Ling and Linghu Yu (令狐愚) felt that Cao Fang was too young and weak to rule and that state power was actually in the hands of Sima Yi. They started a rebellion in Shouchun to overthrow Cao Fang and Sima Yi. They intended to install prince Cao Biao (曹彪) on the throne. Eventually, the rebellion was crushed by Sima Yi and the rebel leaders were killed.
After Sima Yi's death, his sons continued to control Wei and they eliminated almost all their political opponents. Eventually, the royal Cao family's influence in Wei weakened and in 265 Sima Zhao's son Sima Yan forced the last Wei ruler Cao Huan to abdicate and took over the throne, founding the Jin Dynasty.
Modern references.
In the seventh installment of Koei's "Dynasty Warriors" video game series, a stage is dedicated to the initial coup d'etat against Cao Shuang, while the other two are mentioned in the narration. Cao Fang's visit to Gaoping Tombs wasn't mentioned in the game and was mentioned to be on a hunting trip with Cao Shuang.

Robert McCleave

Robert Jardine McCleave (19 December 1922 – 3 September 2004) was a Progressive Conservative party
member of the House of Commons of Canada. He was born in Moncton, New Brunswick and became a dean, journalist, judge and lawyer by career. He was also an editor of the "Halifax Chronicle-Herald" and became a news director at radio station CJCH. McCleave attended Dalhousie University where he graduated in law studies.
He was first elected at the Halifax riding in the 1957 general election. Except for a defeat at that riding in the 1963 federal election, he was re-elected to Parliament until the 1974 federal election.
The Halifax riding was shared by two Members of Parliament until 1967. McCleave was joined by fellow Progressive Conservative member Edmund L. Morris from 1957 to 1963, then by Michael Forrestall, another Progressive Conservative, from 1965 to 1968. The Halifax riding was redefined in 1967 so that it elected only a single Member of Parliament, therefore McCleave campaigned in the Halifax—East Hants riding as of the 1968 federal election. 
He left federal office after 8 December 1977, prior to the end of his term in the 30th Canadian Parliament and became a provincial court judge for the province of Nova Scotia, where he served for ten years.

Bob Delgado

Robert Allan "Bob" Delgado (born 29 January 1949) is a Welsh former footballer who made 281 league appearances in a ten-year career in the Football League. He was a versatile player with power both in the air and in the tackle.
He moved from non-league Barry Town to Luton Town in 1970, before joining Carlisle United the following year. Following a loan spell with Workington in 1973, he moved on to Rotherham United. He helped the "Millers" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1974–75, before joining Chester in October 1975 for £6,000. He was sold on to Port Vale for £30,000 in December 1978, before leaving the English game for American club Miami Americans in 1980. He later had spells with Welsh clubs Oswestry Town and Colwyn Bay, and Hong Kong side Bulova SA.
Playing career.
Delgado signed for Luton Town from Barry Town in February 1970, after Harry Haslam spotted him playing for the Southern League side. However he never took to the field at Kenilworth Road, and was moved on to Carlisle United in 1971. The "Cumbrians" finished tenth in the Second Division in 1971–72 under Ian MacFarlane. Failing to nail down a first team place at Brunton Park under new boss Alan Ashman in 1972–73, Delgado was loaned out to Workington of the Fourth Division. A move to Rotherham United followed, who had just been demoted to the basement division of the Football League. Jimmy McGuigan guided the "Millers" to 15th in 1973–74, before the Millmoor outfit returned to the Third Division with a third place finish in 1974–75.
He moved to league rivals Chester in October 1975, with manager Ken Roberts paying out a £6,000 fee. He became a favourite with the fans thanks to his 'hard man' approach. The "Seals" finished in the lower half of the table in 1975–76 and 1976–77, as new boss Alan Oakes began to build his own team. Chester missed out on promotion in 1977–78 by two places and two points. Delgado left Sealand Road in December 1978, when Port Vale manager Dennis Butler splashed out £30,000 to secure Delgado's services. He made his debut on Boxing Day in a 6–2 defeat to Barnsley at Oakwell. He played 24 games in 1978–79 and 19 games in 1979–80, as the "Valiants" had some of their poorest seasons in the Fourth Division. Delgado never showed his best form at Vale Park, the low point in his spell coming when he scored an own goal in a 7–1 defeat to Huddersfield Town at Leeds Road. His contract was cancelled in May 1980 by new manager John McGrath, following three months on the sidelines.
He subsequently joined up with short-lived American Soccer League side Miami Americans, who only competed for the 1980 season. He then joined Welsh club Oswestry Town. He joined Hong Kong based Bulova SA for the 1983–84 season, and helped the club to secure second place in the First Division League. He then returned to Britain and played for Colwyn Bay.
Management career.
Delgado later managed Upton AA in the West Cheshire League and played for veterans side Chester Nomads, while working as a sales manager for a travel company.

Harold McCarter Taylor

Harold McCarter Taylor CBE TD (13 May 1907 – 23 October 1995) was a New Zealand-born British mathematician, theoretical physicist and academic administrator, but is best known as a historian of architecture and the author, with his first wife Joan Taylor, née Sills, of the three volumes of "Anglo-Saxon Architecture", published between 1965 and 1978.
Life and career.
Taylor was born in Dunedin, son of a merchant, and graduated with an MSc from the University of Otago, whence he continued in 1928 to Cambridge. He worked with Ernest Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, received his PhD in 1933 and became a university lecturer and a Fellow of Clare College Whilst still in New Zealand he had been an officer in the New Zealand Artillery, and on 3 March 1934 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the university Officer Training Corps, commanding the artillery section. He was promoted local captain on 10 March 1934, and received that rank on a substantive basis on 24 November 1935, and was promoted major on 1 May 1936. Following the start of World War II, he was transferred to the Royal Artillery on 30 April 1941, rising to be Senior Instructor in Gunnery at the Royal School of Artillery, with the rank of temporary lieutenant-colonel, and was awarded the Efficiency Decoration (TD). He was awarded the J. H. Lefroy Gold Medal of the Royal Artillery, the only non-regular recipient, for "furthering the science and application of artillery" His experience as a lecturer came in useful when he was a student on a staff course, and the instructor was having great difficulty explaining the difference between two types of gunsight, he offered to help the instructor explain (to the horror of the other students), and was then thanked by the instructor, "Thank you now we all know". He returned to part-time service after the war, and on his eventual retirement from the army in 1957, he was permitted to retain the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel.
After the war, Taylor was appointed university treasurer in Cambridge. He and continued in academic administration as Principal of the University College of North Staffordshire in 1961. When, in 1962, the college became the Keele University, he became its first Vice-Chancellor. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1955 Queen's Birthday Honours.
Taylor developed an interest in Anglo-Saxon architecture early in life. With his wife Joan, née Sills (1903–1965), whom he had married in 1933, he began a survey of more than 400 churches with some remnants of Anglo-Saxon architecture, culminating in the publication in 1965 of the first two volumes of their co-authored "Anglo-Saxon Architecture". Joan died a few weeks before publication. In 1966, Taylor remarried his personal assistant Dorothy Judith Samuel (born 1931), who was also co-author of the third volume of his great work.
The archeologist Philip Rahtz, with whom Taylor collaborated in the investigation of St Mary's Priory Church, Deerhurst, describes Taylor as a "devout Christian" and as "unfailingly elegant, witty, gracious and neat. Rahtz notes in his obituary of Taylor: "Although he wore old clothes in the field, they were always pressed and clean. We could never understand how they remained so, even when he was clambering on dirty roofs or in and out of trenches." 
Taylor was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. In 1981, the Society awarded him and Charles Thomas the first Frend Medal, set up by the church historian and archaeologist William Hugh Clifford Frend, "for services to early Christian archaeology". He was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England on 1 January 1972.
He died in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, and his cremated remains scattered in Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.

Emily Appleton was a Boston socialite and animal lover who provided financial support for the foundation of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in 1868. Appleton was already nurturing an American anti-animal cruelty movement when she saw a letter in the Boston Daily Advertiser from George Thorndike Angell protesting animal cruelty. Within a month, with Appleton's backing, Angell incorporated the society. Appleton, like fellow female activist Caroline Earle White (who was active in Philadelphia), was excluded from executive participation in the society she helped found.

Kwu Tung (古洞) is an area in the northern New Territories, west of Sheung Shui and Fanling, and east of Lok Ma Chau and San Tin, in Hong Kong.
Kwu Tung literally means "old cave" in the Cantonese language. Tung (洞 or 峒) also indicates that it was the habitat of ancient native Cantonese people. These inhabitants were later replaced by Punti, Hakka, and a small number of Teochew people, and the newcomers became the indigenous inhabitants of Hong Kong.
With the sediment of Sheung Yue River and creeks nearby, the land of Kwu Tung is relatively plain compared to the rest of hilly Hong Kong.

3 Corner Satellite

Three Corner Satellite (or 3CS, or 3CornerSat) consists of three student-built microsatellites flying in formation. Primary mission objectives were to demonstrate formation flying, provide stereoscopic imaging of cloud formations, and demonstrate distributed and autonomous operations.
A pair of spacecraft, Ralphie and Sparky, was developed by the University of Colorado at Boulder and Arizona State University as part of the Air Force Research Laboratory's University Nanosat Program. A third satellite, Petey, developed by New Mexico State University was originally also part of the 3CS but was not completed in time for launch.
The 3CS stack was originally slated for launch aboard the Space Shuttle in 2003, but after Shuttle Columbia tragedy, mission organizers switched to Boeing Delta IV Heavy rocket (it was its first launch). Due to a problem with the rocket during launch, 3CS failed to achieve orbit. Satellites were to have been dropped off at a low 180 km × 240 km, but they entered orbit at a height of only 105 km, which led to a rapid decay.

Brighton Grammar School

Brighton Grammar School is an independent, Anglican, day school for boys, located in Brighton, a south-eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
Founded in 1882 by Dr George Henry Crowther, Brighton Grammar has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for approximately 1,220 students from the Early Learning Centre (ELC) to Year 12. The majority of students are drawn from the City of Bayside and surrounding suburbs of Brighton, East Brighton, Elsternwick, Hampton, Sandringham, Beaumaris and Black Rock.
The school is affiliated with a number of associations including the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Anglican Schools Network, and the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS).
History.
Brighton Grammar School was founded on 14 February 1882, with eight male students. By 1890, 160 boys were in attendance. During the depression of the 1890s, students numbers declined rapidly. The school founder, Dr George Henry Crowther was headmaster until his death in 1918. His son, Lieutenant Colonel Harry Arnold A. Crowther, subsequently assumed the role. Crowther retired in 1924, when Herbert E. Dixon took over. Dixon expanded the school until his retirement in 1938. Geoffrey G. Green was headmaster until 1942. His successor was Phillip St. John Wilson.
In 1958, Brighton Grammar joined the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS), and soon after purchased grounds on the former Brighton Gas Company site, where "Wilson House", now the Junior School, was to be built to accommodate the growing student numbers. The number of boys reached 800 during the 1960s. From 1967-1995, Robert Lancelot Rofe was headmaster. He oversaw a period where some new buildings were erected. 
Michael Spencer Urwin was appointed headmaster at the beginning of 1996. He had previously held the position of deputy headmaster at Brisbane Grammar School, and began his term by implementing a curriculum review, a pastoral care system, and a program of modernisation. This also included community education opportunities in out of school hours in order to make the school more inclusive and less parochial. A new senior school library and resource centre, and specialist classroom facilities have been built to upgrade facilities in the senior school as well as the middle school later on.
Affiliations.
Brighton Grammar School has a close sister school relationship with Firbank Girls' Grammar School, an independent Anglican school for girls. Students of the two schools participate in a range of co-educational activities together.
Crowther Centre for Learning and Innovation.
The Crowther Centre for Learning and Innovation is an organisation run under the auspices of Brighton Grammar School to provide support services for the educational community.

<doc id="18694454" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18694454" title="Storm 2">
Storm 2

Storm 2 (commonly known as Storm II) was a robot that competed in the British television game show "Robot Wars". It was a small invertible box-shaped robot with a wedge on the front. The robot was originally built with no weapons but the team was asked to add an active weapon in order to take part in the seventh series, so the team came up with a built-in lifting arm, very similar to the American robot "BioHazard". However, it was not the weapon but the immense speed and power of the robot that did the most damage to its opponents, managing to throw The Steel Avenger out of the Arena in its Series 7 heat final. The robot competed in the seventh series of Robot Wars, winning The Third World Championship at the end of the series, having won the 16th seed into the competition by being victorious in the New Blood Championship of Extreme 2.
Storm 2 was created by Ed Hoppitt, previous member of Suicidal Tendencies. He was joined by Tim Bence and Andrew Rayner. Hoppitt and Bence would alternate driving during the wars. Not long after the filming of New Blood, Andrew Rayner got married, moved house and began a family, so his place on the team was filled by Bence's fiance, Meral Kolac.
Storm 2 is somewhat notable because it is the most prominent robot never to lose a battle through KO, only losing one battle on a very controversial judges' decision. The said decision was the grand final of Series 7, losing the title to Typhoon 2. The announcement of Typhoon's win caused a large amount of booing from the audience; host Craig Charles had demonstrated through a cheering contest beforehand that the audience believed Storm II to be the victor, having been the most aggressive in the battle throughout. The booing was so loud that Mentorn, the producers of Robot Wars, had to add canned applause.
Like many other robots, Storm 2 also competed in "Techno Games" as Ickle Toaster in the Football and Sumo events. The original Storm was never seen in Robot Wars, but competed in various robot combat events across the UK and the "Dutch Robot Games".

Controversy.
Despite Storm 2's success in Robot Wars, the producers were not happy with its lack of weapons and the briefness of most of its matches. They thought that Storm 2 was "boring", and changed the rules to try to keep it out. The last thing the producers wanted after Tornado's Series 6 win was another "box" winning the competition.
The active weapons rule.
After winning the Extreme 2 New Blood tournament, Storm 2 could enter Series 7, but only if an active weapon was added, saying that Storm 2 was classed as "boring" by the producers. The aim was to try to get rid of heavily armoured robots such as Storm 2. The team obliged, somewhat begrudgingly, to put a lifter on Storm 2.
Firestorm.
After Storm 2 kick-started its campaign of the Series 7 championship by throwing The Steel Avenger out of the arena in its Heat Final, Storm 2 met three times Grand Finalist Firestorm 5 in the second round of the semi-final. Storm 2 dominated the match by utilising Firestorm's poor pushing power to eventually pit its opponent. However, Storm 2 was almost disqualified on a technicality — it hadn't fired its lifting arm once during the fight; therefore, the producers argued that Storm 2 should be put out of the competition because of it breaking the "active weapons" rule. The judges refused for some reason, and Storm 2 reached the Grand Final.
Tornado.
In the first fight of the Grand Final, Storm 2 met reigning champion and fellow rambot Tornado. Storm 2 dominated the fight, and easily won the judges decision. However, the judges shouldn't have been needed for the fight. Late on in the fight, with Tornado running inverted, Refbot activated the pit and Tornado drove into it. Much to Team Storm's surprise, the pit raised back up again. Mentorn edited the fight to show Tornado escaping the pit just after it descended. Despite being given the questionable lifeline, Tornado lost the fight.
Typhoon 2.
Storm 2's next battle was to prove one of the most controversial of all. Storm 2 charged into Typhoon 2 and used its lifting arm. Typhoon 2 ran away, before smashing part of the arena wall. The plan was to edit out this part of the fight as if it never happened, although Typhoon 2 refused to spin, so Mentorn allowed Typhoon 2 to repair. Team Storm were surprised at this, but once the wall was fixed, the fight carried on much the same (although the part of the fight showing Typhoon 2 careering into the wall was still shown in the televised fight) until, at the end of the fight, a small panel fell off Storm 2. Cease was called, and, after a difficult judges decision, Typhoon 2 was given the win. Team Storm were deeply annoyed by this, especially since Typhoon 2 was listed as "no damage", despite the fact that its drive chains were scattered all over the arena floor. Team Storm were also saddened by the fact that the show concentrated on Storm 2's aforementioned panel and not Typhoon 2's drive chains, despite losing the latter having a larger difference than losing a small panel. Some Storm 2 supporters called for Gary Cairns, captain of Team Typhoon, to hand his trophy to Team Storm, but the decision stood. The booing from the crowd (save for the small group of Typhoon 2 supporters, who were cheering in delight) was so loud that Mentorn had to add canned applause to hide the booing.
Shooting began for the Third World Championships later that day, and Typhoon 2 were supposed to be fighting in Heat D, but had to pull out because of "technical difficulties". The real reason why Typhoon 2 pulled out was because between Typhoon (the middleweight) and Typhoon 2 there was only one set of batteries. Team Typhoon opted to defend (and keep) their Middleweight Championship status. Typhoon 2 wasn't seen again that day.
Supernova.
The last controversial incident involving Storm 2 ironically happened in the last ever televised fight. During the Third World Championship Final, Supernova, the Sri Lankan representative, launched an unsuccessful attack on Storm 2. One of its wheels was on Storm 2's wedge, leaving it off balance and it careered sideways into the arena wall, stuck. Storm 2 ran away, believing Team Storm had won the fight, but Refbot freed Supernova instead of counting it out as his counter wasn't working. Then Shunt propped Storm 2 against the angle grinder. After Supernova got away, Storm 2 was finally freed, but it was running inverted, where it was more vulnerable to attacks. After another close decision, the judges gave Storm 2 the win, based on the old rule that if a robot (in this case, Supernova) is immobilised for more than 30 seconds, it is out of the fight. This fight has received criticism for heavy editing use, since the televised fight didn't accurately show how long Supernova was pinned on the wall. Supernova was judged to be stacked on the arena wall for far more than 30 seconds, meaning it lost.

North German baroque organ in Örgryte Nya Kyrka

The North German baroque organ in Örgryte Nya Kyrka is a pipe organ in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was built within a research project at GOArt, University of Gothenburg and dedicated on August 12, 2000. The goal of the project was to recreate the construction techniques and design philosophies of 17th-century German organbuilder Arp Schnitger. Even though the instrument was built in the style of this single builder it was not modeled after a single instrument. No single model could be used since no large Schnitger organ has been preserved in original condition. The construction of the organ was carried out by an international team of organ builders. Henk van Eeken was responsible for the design and the technical drawings, Munetaka Yokota for the pipe work and Mats Arvidsson oversaw the building process. The instruments contains almost 4000 pipes and is the largest existing organ tuned in quarter-comma meantone.
Design.
The design of the instrument was the result of the study of several historic organs. The pipework and disposition was largely based on the Schnitger organ in St. Jacobi (St James's), Hamburg while the façade and the console were based on the organ in Lübeck Cathedral. The bellows were designed after the organ in the Grote Kerk (Great Church), Zwolle while the key action was modeled after the organ in St. Laurent's church in Alkmaar.
Console and action.
The console in Örgryte is based on the console from Lübeck Cathedral, the only preserved console from a large Schnitger organ. Since the Lübeck instrument only had three manuals and the Örgryte has four, the concept had to be expanded.
Pipe work.
The pipework was built with the St. Jakobi organ as the model (with very few exceptions). However, that instrument has been revoiced a number of times, so complementary studies had to be made of well-preserved pipes of other organs.
Case.
The west wall of Örgryte Nya Kyrka was too small to fit a copy of the 32' façade in St. Jacobi, Hamburg so a different model had to be found. The solution chosen was to use the design of the Schnitger organ in Lübeck Cathedral. Since that organ was destroyed in firebombing of Lübeck on Palm Sunday 1942, it had to be reconstructed from photographs using photogrammetrical methods. The case was placed as close as possible to the wall to shorten the distance the air must travel from the bellows room and to increase acoustical reflection.
A new balcony had to be constructed to support the organ case. It was designed by architect Ulf Oldaeus, based on a number of historical models, mainly the balconies of St. Nicolai und Martini in Steinkirchen, Lower Saxony.
Wind system.
The organs built by Arp Schnitger had a higher number of bellows per instrument than many other builders of his time. In his larger instruments it was not uncommon to have 12 or even 16 bellows. Since the Schnitger organ in Zwolle is the only one with a well-preserved original bellows system it was used as the model for the Örgryte organ. For practical reasons it was decided to include an electrical blower as an option to pumping the bellows manually.
The windchests were based on those of Hamburg St. Jacobi, but were slightly modified to fit into the Örgryte case. Some modification also had to be made to accommodate the extra pipes for the sub-semitones.
Disposition.
The organ has 54 stops divided between 4 manuals and pedals. It is tuned in quarter-comma meantone and the pitch is a’ = 465 Hz.

There is little or no Internet censorship in Malawi, but Internet access is limited by high cost and lack of infrastructure.
There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms. Individuals and groups can engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. Lack of infrastructure and the high cost of Internet connections limits Internet access.
Malawi law prohibits the publication or transmission of anything "that could be useful to the enemy", as well as religiously offensive and obscene material. Malawi participates in regional efforts to combat cybercrime: the East African Community (consisting of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and the South African Development Community (consisting of Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) have both enacted plans to standardize cybercrime laws throughout their regions. There is a Malawi Censorship Board, but its primary function is the review of books.
According to International Telecommunications Union statistics for 2009, approximately 4.7 percent of the country's inhabitants used the Internet. In August 2009 the Malawi Internet Service Providers' Association (MISPA) listed 35 licensed ISPs (21 OK or operational, 14 not operational). The Malawi Internet Exchange (MIX) became operational in December 2008.

"All That I Got Is You" is the solo debut single by Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ghostface Killah, released as the lead single from his solo debut album "Ironman". The song features R&B songstress Mary J. Blige and an outro which has Popa Wu giving teachings. It contains a sample of "Maybe Tomorrow" by The Jackson 5 as well as audio clips from the cult film "The Education of Sonny Carson". 
Ghostface wrote the song as a tribute to his mother, with lyrics that both depict the harsh life the two struggled through together during his childhood and praise her ability to raise him even in their downtrodden state. About.com ranked it #87 on their list of the Top 100 Rap Songs. Ghostface added the song to his greatest hits album "Shaolin's Finest" and on the compilation album "The RZA Hits".
Music video.
The music video for "All That I Got Is You" was directed by Terry Heller and Chuck Ozeas. Mary J. Blige was unavailable for the music video version, and is replaced by Wu-Tang Clan in-singer Tekitha for the hook and second verse. The video illustrates the images described within the lyrics of the song, featuring a young boy who portrays Ghostface in his youth born into a family of fifteen, with his mother, grandmother, aunts, uncles and cousins; all living in a three-bedroom apartment. 
The boy experiences all the hardships depicted in the song: growing up in a poor family in the Stapleton Housing Projects, watching his father leave their family at the age of six, sharing a small bed with three other siblings, picking roaches out of water-filled cereal and going next door to borrow leftover bread from neighbors. The scenes are intercut with present-day Ghostface playing a piano in the middle of a desolate street and a small choir.

Jorge Volio Jiménez

Jorge Volio Jiménez (August 26, 1882 - October 20, 1955) was a Costa Rican priest, soldier and politician.
Biography.
Jorge Volio was born August 26, 1882 in Cartago, Costa Rica to Carlos Volio Llorente and Matilde Jiménez Oreamuno. In 1901, he graduated with a baccalaureate in humanities with distinction ("bachiller en humanidades con Distinción Unánime") from the Liceo de Costa Rica. In 1903, he traveled to Belgium to study at the León XII Seminary of the University of Leuven. While in Europe, he also studied at the Saint-Sulpice Seminary of Paris and at the University of Freiburg. In 1906, he graduated magna cum laude in philosophy. In 1909, he was ordained as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church.
After returning from Europe to Costa Rica, Volio went to Nicaragua to join Augusto César Sandino's guerilla army, the "liberales", in the struggle against the United States occupation of Nicaragua. He achieved the rank of general. Returning to Costa Rica to teach, he was persecuted by the military dictatorship of Federico Tinoco Granados. In 1919, he joined the Sapoá Revolution against Tinoco's regime. When the revolution failed, Volio made unsuccessful attempts to organize invasions from Panama and Nicaragua to oust the ruling junta.
In 1922, Volio was seated in the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica, representing the independence party of San Ramón. In 1923, he founded the Reform Party ("Partido Reformista") to fight for the working class and the poor. He ran as the Reform Party candidate for President of Costa Rica in 1924, coming in third behind Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno ("Partido Republicano Nacional") and Alberto Echandi Montero ("Partido Agrícola"). Later, he served as director of the National Archives. Volio retired from active politics in 1936, dedicating himself to farming in Sierpe, Osa Canton.
When the University of Costa Rica was opened in 1940, Volio was asked to join the faculty. He was named a professor of philosophy and national history and Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters.
Volio served twice as a deputy for the "Partido Republicano Nacional Independiente", in 1953 and 1955. He died October 20, 1955.

Salient (geography)

A salient is a term for an elongated arm-like protrusion of a geopolitical entity, such as a subnational entity or a sovereign state. 
Term.
The term "salient" is derived from military salients. While similar to a peninsula in shape, a salient is not surrounded by water on three sides and connected to a geographical mainland. Instead, it is delimited by a land border on at least two sides and extends out from the larger geographical body of the administrative unit. 
The salient shape is the result of arbitrarily drawn international or subnational boundaries, although the location of some administrative borders takes into account other considerations such as economic ties or topography.

Aundh Experiment

The Aundh Experiment was an early test of village-level self-government in British India which began in 1938. Mohandas Gandhi, the Raja of Aundh, and Maurice Frydman helped to draft the November Declaration, which handed over rule of the state of Aundh from the Raja to the residents, and became law in the Swaraj Constitution of Aundh in 1939. The Aundh Experiment was an unusual idea in pre-independence India, where the rulers of princely states were loath to hand over their power.
Development and ratification.
At the time, Aundh was a princely state in British India, ruled by generations of Rajas since 1699. Unlike the Provinces of India, which were ruled directly by the British government, the princely states had a certain degree of autonomy—with each state making its own treaty with the British Monarch. In 1938, the ruler of Aundh, Raja Bhavanrao, was approached by Frydman (also known as Swami Bharatananda), a Polish engineer who was a disciple of Gandhi. According to the Raja's son, Apa Pant, "Frydman had great influence with my father, and on his seventy-fifth birthday he said, 'Raja Saheb, why don't you go and make a declaration to Mahatma Gandhi that you are giving all power to the people because it will help in the freedom struggle.'"
Raja Bhavanrao was a strong supporter of the Indian independence movement, and stood up for the welfare of the people of Aundh, "in sharp contrast to the attitude and behavior of the majority of Maharajas and Rajas", according to Indira Gandhi. The Raja readily endorsed the idea of self-government, Frydman wrote a draft declaration, and the Raja and his son traveled to Wardha to see Gandhi. There, Gandhi dictated the final draft of the constitution, which was sent to the state assembly to be ratified on January 21, 1939.
The Raja was a self-proclaimed nationalist, and the beginning of the experiment in 1938 caused concern among the British rulers, who reprimanded him for being a friend of Gandhi, who they called "the rebel against the Raj." In response, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Indian National Congress offered their support to the Raja.
Swaraj, or self-rule, was the foundation of Gandhi's movement for independence from British domination, and included the principles of self-governance and community building. At the inauguration of the constitution, Raja Bhavanrao affirmed Gandhi's ideals of Swaraj, declaring that:
We have to urge the people of Aundh to remember always that government being control, self government implies self-control and self-sacrifice. In the new era that is coming to Aundh, and we hope to the whole of our country, the strong will serve the weak, the wealthy will serve the poor, the learned will serve the illiterate. Self government without this spirit of service and sacrifice is bound to decay into some form or other of exploitation.
After ratification.
After ratification, the state of Aundh was reorganized from the ground up, with local administration put in the hands of village "panchayats" with five elected representatives, voted into office through new voting rights given to all adults. Each "panchayat" chose a president, who represented them at regional "taluka" councils. Each "taluka" council chose a president and two representatives to a Central Assembly presided over by the raja. In spite of the Raja's role as leader of the Assembly, responsibility for regional government was, for all practical purposes, in the hands of the people. The "panchayats" were given responsibility for all matters relating to education, welfare, justice, water supply, sanitation, construction and maintenance of roads and public buildings, and all other activities relating to the health safety, and social and economic wellbeing of the villagers.
Between 1939 and 1945, twenty-seven new primary schools were established, making more than one per village. In addition, fourteen middle schools and three high schools were built and staffed, with the total number of teachers more than doubling. Adult education also saw a doubling of expenditure.
Several Indian National Congress leaders from Maharashtra became actively involved in the Aundh Experiment in the 1940s, including Tatya Shikhare, Annasaheb Sahasrabudhe, and Nana and Bhau Dharmadhikari. When Achutrao Patwardan went into hiding to avoid arrest during the Quit India movement in 1946, he used Aundh villages as his base of operations. He went as far as adopting the language of the Aundh State Constitution, declaring that he and his band of freedom fighters were ""Prati Sakar""—"self-governing and independent of the Central Authority."
The Aundh Experiment in village-level self-rule endured until Indian independence in 1947, when all of the princely states were merged into the new Republic of India.

Our Lady of Akita

Our Lady of Akita is the title of Marian apparitions reported in 1973 by 
Sister Agnes Katsuko Sasagawa in the remote area of Yuzawadai, near the city of Akita in Japan. The messages emphasize prayer and penance. Sister Sasagawa stated that the Virgin Mary told her: ""Pray very much the prayers of the Rosary. I alone am able still to save you from the calamities which approach.""
The apparitions were unusual in that the crying of the statue of the Virgin Mary was broadcast on national television in Japan.
Background.
For several decades, Agnes Sasagawa had encountered many health problems as a result of a poorly performed appendix operation and was immobile for over a decade. Her health reportedly improved after drinking water from Lourdes. After going totally deaf, she went to live with the nuns in the remoteness of Yuzawadai in Akita prefecture.
Apparitions.
In 1973 Sister Agnes reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary, as well as stigmata and a weeping statue of the Virgin Mary which, it is said, continued to weep over the next 6 years on 101 occasions. The nuns at Yuzawadai also reported stigmata on the statue, as well as on the hands of Sister Agnes. The stigmata on the statue is said to have appeared before the tears started, and disappeared after the tears.
Sister Agnes only reported three messages from the Blessed Virgin during 1973, but the Virgin Mary Statue is reported to have continued to weep thereafter. Sister Agnes reported that she first heard the statue calling her, and then the first message began.
In June 1988 Bishop Ito brought his pastoral letter of April 22, 1984 to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who allowed the pastoral letter and its dissemination to the faithful. On April 1990, the apostolic nuncio in Japan, Bishop William Aquin Carew in an interview with 30 DAYS, a Catholic Magazine, noted of Cardinal Ratzinger that: “His Eminence did not give any judgment on the reliability or credibility of the ‘messages of the Virgin.’
Sister Agnes reports that in the first message the Virgin Mary asked her to recite a prayer of reparation together, and told her in 1973 that her deafness will be cured. The other reported messages ask for the praying of the rosary and to pray to repair the sins of others, as "Acts of Reparation". The second message is said to have included the following:
The third message warned of possible worldwide calamities if men did not repent and emphasized the need to pray the rosary. It stated that it was the final message to Sister Agnes and ended with the statement:
During a Sunday Mass in 1982, Sister Agnes was totally cured from her deafness. Bishop John Shojiro Ito of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Niigata who had been an eyewitness to some of the events at Akita initially approved the apparition in 1984. In 1988 he went to Rome to consult with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI).

Malpaís (landform)

A malpaís is a landform characterized by eroded rocks of volcanic origin in an arid environment. This describes many xeric places, but is strongly connected to Spanish-speaking countries and the Southwestern United States because of the Spanish settlers that gave the landform its name.
Badlands landform.
The word 'malpaís' in Spanish translates to "badland", and this describes the area as being unusable for crops. Although a malpaís is often another word for the badlands that form by erosion of sedimentary rocks in the same environment, a malpaís is also often associated with such types of lava plain terrain as found in a volcanic field. The geology of malpaís terrain is bare to thin layers of soil over lava with sparse vegetation. The lava fields usually consist of lava tube cave systems, sinkholes, pyroclastic deposits from cinder cone volcanoes, ʻaʻā and pāhoehoe lava flows. The lava tubes can vary from intact caves to partial or completely collapsed passages. The collapsed tubes, sinkholes, and jagged ʻaʻā surfaces are what make malpaís terrain so difficult to navigate and cultivate, thereby earning their name.
Examples.
The El Malpais National Monument is an example of this landform in New Mexico. The Carrizozo Malpaís and Jornada del Muerto Volcano lava plain, in the Tularosa Basin's Jornada del Muerto Desert are other New Mexico examples. The Malpaís de Güímar is an example in the Spanish Canary Islands.
Etymology.
A loanword from Spanish, "malpaís" is in wide use in English in the southwest United States. Although the literal translation of "malpaís" is "badland", other Spanish (Castilian) terms for badlands are "tierras baldías" and "cárcava".

Deng Linlin

"Deng Linlin" (; ; born April 21, 1992, in Lixin, Anhui), is a Chinese gymnast. She was a member of the Chinese team that won the team gold medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and is a three-time World Cup gold medalist. She was the 2009 World Champion and is the current Olympic champion on balance beam.
Gymnastics career.
Deng Linlin began her gymnastics career in Fuyang, Anhui (her family moved from Lixin to Fuyang at 1998), at the Anhui Fuyang Sports School and later attended the Anhui Provincial Sports School. She was selected to the Chinese national team in 2004 and made her international competitive debut in 2008, when she competed in several events on the World Cup circuit. At the World Cup meet in Doha in March, she won the gold medal on the balance beam and placed second on floor exercise behind her teammate Jiang Yuyuan. At the World Cup in Moscow, Deng won gold medals on both beam and floor.
At the 2008 Chinese National Championships, Deng finished in third place in the all-around, behind Jiang Yuyuan and Yang Yilin and also placed third on vault.
In 2009, after 7 months long knee recovery, Deng started to prepare for the 11th Chinese National Games held in September, during the competition, she surprisingly won the gold in the all-around final from the second group (7th in qualification) of the 24 finalists. After posed three solid routine on bars, beam and floor, she took a shot on vault for attempting the double twisting Yurchenko and succeeded with a clean landing to guarantee the exceeding of Yang Yilin and Sui Lu from Guangdong and Shanghai, respectively.

Even though, she continued her international success in 2010, garnering a team bronze medal at the 2010 World Championships with the Chinese team as well as an individual silver medal on the balance beam. During the team final, the judges degraded her back layout somersault (an E level element) to a whip (a C level element), which resulted her 0.7 valued back flip + back flip + back layout series became only 0.3, and the shown 15.10 score replaced with 14.70 after a call made from the Russian senior judge. In the beam final, as the same to pervious year, she still held the highest D value, 6.6.

In the preliminary team competition, Deng performed on all four apparatuses. She was ranked ninth overall after the preliminary round; however, Deng did not advance to the individual all-around final because no more than two gymnasts may represent each country in the all-around competition.
For the team final, Chinese coaches decided to replace Jiang with Deng on vault only 20 minutes before the competition. Deng performed solidly on all the three events in the team final, sticking a double twisting Yurchenko vault and received a 15.250. Deng also performed on balance beam and floor exercise, with a score of 15.925 on beam and a 15.150 on floor respectively.

Martin McNamara

Martin McNamara is a famous Gaelic footballer from Corofin, County Galway.
McNamara was the reliable servant in goal for Galway for several years. It was the time when a Galway match wouldn’t be a Galway match without a McNamara save of blinding quality. Unfortunately it was also the time of a barren spell for the Galway team. That barren spell seemed to turn around with a first Connacht title in 8 years in 1995 and a narrow semi-final defeat to Tyrone but Mayo seemed to halt any revival that Galway were planning when they reached the next two All-Ireland finals, both at Galway's expense in Connacht.
As the 98 championship approached, retirement from inter-county football was a serious prospect for McNamara. He considered such a thought after playing a key role in Corofin's All-Ireland Club Championship winning team of 1998 but decided to contionue for the time being. It would be a decision he would never regret.
John O'Mahony had taken over the reins of Galway football from Val Daly in 97 and was to take Galway through their most successful period since the famous "Three In A Row" era. They defeated Mayo in the first round of the Connacht SFC and extended Leitrim a similar courtesy in the semi-final. In the final, they played Roscommon on July 13 in a rainy day at Tuam Stadium. McNamara made crucial saves throughout the game and Galway forced a replay with a late Niall Finnegan free. Galway won the replay after extra time by 1-17 to 0-17. They were a step above Derry in the semi-final and not even a late penalty could ruin the day as Galway won by 0-16 to 1-08. In the final, they met a Kildare side who had bet the 1995, 1996, and the 1997 All-Ireland champions in their road to Croke Park. Kildare frustrated Galway in the first half and led by 1-05 to 0-05. However, Galway turned thing around in the 2nd half to win their 8th All-Ireland title, 1-14 to 1-10. For McNamara it had completed a unique double of club and county All-Ireland success. McNamara was named in the Goalkeeper slot for the 1998 All-Stars, confirming his status as best Goalkeeper in the country that year.
Galway looked to repeat their success in 1999 but Mayo gained revenge for the defeat in 98 by defeating Galway in the Connacht final at Tuam. Soon after Galway’s defeat in the Connacht final, McNamara decided to call it a day, again, but decided to have one final crack ath the title in 2000.
In 2000, Galway defeated New York, Sligo and Leitrim on their way to another Connacht title. In the semi-final, they faced Kildare with the 98 decider fresh in their minds but Galway finished strongly to qualify for another All-Ireland final. Galway met Kerry in the final and after a poor start, Galway had kept Kerry to six points for the final 50 minutes. However they were unable to strike the winning score and the final finished level, 0-14 each. In the replay, a wonderful goal by Declan Meehan was not enough as Kerry won by 0-17 to 1-10. McNamara finally decided to retire at the age of 34.
In recent years, the goalkeeper berth left void by McNamara has been filled by Alan Keane, Pádraig Lally and Brian O'Donoghue. Although current goalkeeper Paul Doherty may be a worthy No.1 for Galway, it is believed that the position hasn't been truly replaced since McNamara retired.

Kings County (barque)

Kings County was a four masted barque built in 1890 at Kingsport, Nova Scotia on the Minas Basin. She was named to commemorate Kings County, Nova Scotia and represented the peak of the county's shipbuilding era. (A much smaller barque also named "Kings County" had been built in 1871.) "Kings County" was one of the largest wooden sailing vessels ever built in Canada and one of only two Canadian four-masted barques. (The other was the slightly smaller "John M. Blaikie" of Great Village, Nova Scotia.) At first registered as a four masted full rigged ship, she was quickly changed to a barque after her June 2 launch. More than three thousand people from Kings and Hants counties attended the launch. She survived a collision with an iceberg on an 1893 voyage to Swansea, Wales. Like many of the large wooden merchant ships built in Atlantic Canada, she spent most of her career far from home on trading voyages around the world. In 1909, she returned to the Minas Basin for a refit at Hantsport and loaded a large cargo of lumber. In 1911 she became the largest wooden ship to enter Havana Harbour when she delivered a cargo of lumber and was briefly stranded. She was lost a few months later on a voyage to Montevideo, Uruguay when she ran aground in the River Plate. Too damaged to repair, she was scrapped in Montevideo where her massive timbers were visible for many years.

Juraj Baraković

Juraj Baraković (1548 – August 1, 1628) was a Croatian Renaissance poet from Zadar.
Baraković was born in the village of Plemići, Rtina. He wrote several distinguished pieces (""Jarula"", Venice 1618 - Old and New Testament in storytelled form; ""Draga, rapska pastirica""), but one work excels in his literary opus: complicated and the most explicitly manneristic epic in 13 books ""Vila slovinka"" (Venice, 1613).
Most of Baraković's poetry was dedicated to the glory of Zadar, with firm reliance on his co-citizen Petar Zoranić that already left a notable mark on Croatian literature. ""Vila slovinka"", an epic written in the glory of Zadar, has two especially notable features: in the eighth book the eleven octosyllabic sonnets are listed, which are, beside a few anonymously written ones in Ranjina's Miscellany, the only sonnets in Croatian poetry before the Illyrian movement. The same book contains perfectly stylised "bugarščica" about Mother Margarita, which astonishes both readers and philologists for centuries, still leaving to be determined whether is it a folk song that Baraković incorporated into his own work following the model of Petar Hektorović, or is it his own song adapted to the stylistical features of the folk poem stanzas, or the folk song enhanced by Baraković's skilful poetical and artistical genius.
Baraković died in Rome.

<doc id="18694763" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18694763" title="Gomphidius roseus">
Gomphidius roseus

Gomphidius roseus, commonly known as the rosy spike-cap or pink gomphidius, is a gilled mushroom found in Europe. Although it has gills, it is a member of the order Boletales, along with the boletes. It is a coral pink-capped mushroom which appears in pine forests in autumn, always near the related mushroom "Suillus bovinus", on which it appears to be parasitic.
Taxonomy.
"Gomphidius roseus" was initially described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries as "Agaricus glutinosus β roseus" in 1821, before he elevated it to species status and gave its current genus and binomial name in 1838. The genus name is derived from the Greek 'γομφος' "gomphos" meaning "plug" or "large wedge-shaped nail". The specific epithet "roseus" is the Latin adjective "pink".
Description.
The mushroom has a coral-pink cap up to 5 cm (2 in) in diameter, though sometimes larger, which is initially convex and later flattening and becoming a more brick colour with maturity. Often slimy or sticky as with other members of the genus, its cap lacks the blackish markings of the related "G. glutinosus". The stipe is 2.5–4.5 cm (1–1.6 in) high and 0.4–1 cm wide and bears an indistinct ring. It is white with a pinkish or wine-coloured tint and often flushed yellow at the base. The whitish flesh may also be tinged pink and has little taste or smell. The decurrent gills are grey, and the spore print is brownish-black.
Distribution and habitat.
An uncommon fungus, "Gomphidius roseus" is found in Europe, but not in North America. A similar pinkish species, "G. subroseus" occurs in North America. It is found in pine woods, particularly "Pinus sylvestris", associated with "Suillus bovinus", and is often hidden in undergrowth. Fruiting bodies sprout in the autumn.
Ecology.
Like other members of the family Gomphidiaceae, "Gomphidius roseus" has been thought to be ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationship with their host trees. However, there is now evidence that many (and perhaps all) species in this group are parasitic upon ectomycorrhizal boletes, in relationships that are often highly species-specific, in this case "Suillus bovinus".
Edibility.
"Gomphidius roseus" is not known to be toxic but is reported to be of poor quality and hence not recommended for picking.

Brian Tatler

Brian Tatler is an English musician, best known as the guitarist and co-founder of the Stourbridge based heavy metal band, Diamond Head.
Diamond Head.
"For the history of Diamond Head see: Diamond Head (band)"
Formation.
Originally trained as a mechanic, Tatler is most famous for his first band, Diamond Head. Tatler founded the band along with schoolmate Duncan Scott, he playing on a cheap fuzz guitar and Scott on some biscuit tins. They later enrolled the help of Sean Harris and Colin Kimberley on vocals and bass guitar respectively.
The band recorded and released self-financed demo tapes in 1977 and 1979. Although only recorded within six hours on a four-track, their unique sound and quality of song writing gained enough attention to tour as support with AC/DC and Iron Maiden. Although many record companies fought to sign the band, none were willing to commit fully. The band grew impatient and decided that they would release their material through their own label "Happy Face Records". The band released their debut album on this label most commonly known as "Lightning to the Nations", although it has never officially had a title. This album came in a plain sleeve with no title, having on it only a signature of one of the band members and no track listings. Amongst the stand out features of this album were the epic riffs created by Tatler, which prompted "Sounds" magazine to claim that "one Diamond Head song contains more Chords than an entire Black Sabbath album".
Influence.
Tatler has cited early influences to be bands such as Scorpions, UFO and Rainbow. Tatler has stated that some of the first albums he bought were Led Zeppelin's second album and Deep Purple's "Machine Head", and that his favourite album is Zeppelin's "Physical Graffiti", as it contains his favourite song "Kashmir". He has said that although most of his guitar work was inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, it was the punk rock movement that showed him that anyone could form a band. Nowadays, Tatler tries not to be influenced by more modern bands in order to keep his traditional sound, although he imagines that "little bits creep into the writing process".
MCA Years.
The success of the first album led to a record deal with MCA Records in 1981, and they released the "Four Cuts EP". Their 'major label' status afforded them a slot on the Reading Festival bill in 1982. Their set was recorded by the BBC, and later released in 1992 through Raw Fruit Records as the "Friday Rock Show Sessions".
Their first MCA LP was "Borrowed Time", which reached #24 in the UK Albums Chart. In many interviews Tatler has stated that 1982 was his favourite year, and found the era to be extremely exciting, trying to guess who is going to be the first NWOBHM band to make it big.
Their follow-up, "Canterbury", was released in 1983. Tatler has expressed since that making this album was one of the most stressful periods of his life, and the entire process almost caused him to have a nervous breakdown. He also said that having to fire his best friends from the band was one of the hardest things he has had to do. 
The band split up for the first time in 1985. Around the same time, Tatler also decided that it was time to get rid of his signature white Flying V and convert to a Gibson Les Paul, saying that "I think the Les Paul's better, the V's more of a metal guitar. At one stage it was just me and Schenker with them, now the guy in Saxon's got one and all the European metal bands like Accept have them."
1990s.
Radio Moscow.
After Diamond Head split, Tatler went on to run RPK 24track studio, in Lye, recording and producing local bands. He also formed the band Radio Moscow (not to be confused with the modern American blues-rock band of the same name), which drummer Karl Wilcox, who later went on to be a part of a reformed Diamond Head. Radio Moscow recorded two albums, ("World Service" and "Get A New Life") both of which featured Ritch Battersby on drums, who later went on to perform with G.T.A and also The Wildhearts.
First Diamond Head reunion.
Tatler and Sean Harris reformed Diamond Head in 1990. The band signed to Warner/Chappell and released their fourth album "Death and Progress" in 1993, but the reunion was short lived.
Modern Day.
Quill.
After the spilt, Tatler joined Thin Lizzy tribute act, Dizzy Lizzy, before joining up with the Celtic rock band, Quill. During his time with Quill, Tatler recorded three albums ("Out of the hat", "Privileged" and "Back Intact").
Diamond Head's acoustic years and Nick Tart era.
Tatler played his last show with Quill in November 2000, and rejoined Harris to perform and record an acoustic version of Diamond Head, along with guitarist Floyd Brennan. Tatler and Harris recorded and toured new material and played their first gig in North America, playing the Metal Meltdown festival in New Jersey. However, the new album was never released. Harris' reluctance to tour and only concentrate on releasing further albums prompted Tatler to consider his options away from Harris.
Also during this time, Tatler collaborated with Dave Mustaine of Megadeth on an album together. However, after Mustaine decided to reform Megadeth, this project was shelved and never released.
Meanwhile, Tatler decided to resurrect Diamond Head with new vocalist Nick Tart who worked on Diamond Head's fifth studio album, "All Will Be Revealed", which was released through Cargo Records in 2005. Tatler stated that his aim was just to try to release a solid rock album, with "punchy" riffs and no fillers. After a successful tour supporting Megadeth, in 2007 Diamond Head released their latest album "What's in Your Head?".
In 2009, Tatler released his autobiography, "Am I Evil?". "It all started in a bedroom with a biscuit tin drum kit and a cheap fuzzy guitar, and went on to create some of the most exciting music ever written and inspire the biggest heavy metal band on the planet". The book contained forewords by Lars Ulrich and Dave Mustaine.
In 2011 Tatler co-wrote the song Black Skies Mist with rising Birmingham Rock band Voodoo Johnson

Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina

The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina (Spanish: Tratado de Paz y Amistad de 1984 entre Chile y Argentina, see the text in the United Nations) was signed into agreement at the Vatican on 29 November 1984.
It was ratified
On 12 April 1985 it was signed by Augusto Pinochet and on 2 May 1985 the Foreign Ministers of both countries exchanged original documents. Due to the timing, the treaty is variously known as the 1984 Treaty or the 1985 Treaty.
The treaty contains a preamble, a maritime border definition, a comprehensive body of legislation on solving disputes, ship navigation rights and an exact definition of the border through the Straits of Magellan.
Chile and Argentina, though never at war with each other, have named some of their border treaties as "peace treaties".
Genesis of the treaty.
The treaty ended the Beagle conflict and was the result of long standing negotiations between Chile, Argentina and the Vatican as mediator. The outcome of the Falklands war made the treaty possible. When consulted in a non-binding referendum on resolving the conflict by then President Raul Alfonsin, 82% of Argentine population voted in favor of signing the treaty.
The Preamble.
The treaty recognizes the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina and its "«…supplementary and declaratory instruments…»" as the unshakeable foundation of relations between Chile and Argentina and defines the border "«…from the end of the existing boundary in the Beagle Channel, i.e., the point fixed by the coordinates 55°07.3' South latitude and 66°25.0' West longitude…»" (Bold by Wikipedia). That is, Argentina recognizes the borderline determined by the Beagle Channel Arbitration in 1977 (Report and Decision of the Court of Arbitration), which it had earlier rejected. Hence, there is no mention of Picton, Nueva, Lennox and other islands. The Treaty calls its content a ""
Excepting articles 1 to 6, which define a comprehensive body of legislation regarding dispute resolution, the other provisions shall not affect in any way, nor may they be interpreted in any way, that can affect, directly or indirectly, the sovereignty, rights, juridical positions of the Parties, or the boundaries in Antarctica or in its adjacent maritime areas, including the seabed and subsoil.
The maritime border.
The international maritime border is the line ABCDEF. Westward are Chilean waters, eastward are Argentine waters.
Both countries mutually recognized its baselines. (The Chilean Baseline can be seen here). From the Cape Horn Meridian (67°16',0 West) to the east end of the Isla de los Estados both countries reduced their internal waters to only in their mutual relations.
The line ABCDEF gives most of the exclusive economic zone of the islands (eastwards of Cape Horn) previously in dispute to Argentina. On the map, the gray line is approximately equidistant between the shores of Chile and Argentina. Such an equidistant line is normally how maritime borders are drawn between two countries, though this approach is not compulsory.
Navigation rights.
Vessels of all nations in traffic between the Straits of Magellan and Argentine ports in the Beagle Channel, and vice versa, enjoy navigation facilities exclusively along the following route through Chilean internal waters: Magdalena Channel, Canal Cockburn, Paso Brecknock or Canal Occasion, Canal Ballenero, Canal O'Brien, Paso Timbales, northwest arm of the Beagle Channel and the Beagle Channel as far as the meridian 68°36'38.5" West longitude and vice versa. The passage shall be navigated with a Chilean pilot and the Chilean Authority shall be informed at least 48 hours in advance of the date on which the vessel will begin passage.
For maritime traffic between Argentine ports in the Beagle Channel and the Argentine Exclusive Economic Zone (or Antarctic), and vice versa, Argentine vessels shall enjoy navigation facilities for the passage through Chilean internal waters exclusively via the following route: Paso Picton and Paso Richmond, then following from a point fixed by the coordinates 55'21.0' South latitude and 66*41.0" West longitude, the general direction of the arc between true 090' and 180', emerging in the Chilean territorial sea; or crossing the Chilean territorial sea in the general direction of the arc between true 270' and 000', and continuing through Paso Richmond and Paso Picton. The passage may be effected without a Chilean pilot and without notice.
For maritime traffic to and from the north through the Le Maire Strait, Chilean vessels shall enjoy navigation facilities for the passage of that strait, without an Argentine pilot and without notice.
The Strait of Magellan.
The Straits of Magellan belong, since the Treaty of 1881, to Chile, The Straits are a demilitarized zone and free for navigation for vessels of all countries.
New in respect thereof is that the Argentine Republic undertakes to maintain, at any time and in whatever circumstances, the right of ships of all flags to navigate expeditiously and without obstacles through its jurisdictional waters to and from the Straits of Magellan.
The Parties give mutual recognition to the baselines which they have traced in their respective territories. That is, regarding the Straits of Magellan, Argentina recognizes that the Straits of Magellan have no delta at the western end and that the Channels Abra, Magdalena, Cockburn and others are Chilean internal waters as defined by the Chilean baselines and that they are not free for navigation. 
The parties agree that at the eastern end of the Straits of Magellan, defined by Punta Dúngeness in the north and Cabo del Espiritu Santo in the south, the boundary between their respective sovereignties shall be the straight line joining the "Dungeness Marker (Former Beacon)", located at the very tip of the said geographical feature, and "Marker I on Cabo del Espiritu Santo" in Tierra del Fuego. The sovereignty of Chile and Argentina over the sea, seabed and subsoil shall extend, respectively, to the west and east of this boundary. This commitment ends any Chilean projection over the Atlantic and any Argentine pretension to coregulate traffic in the Straits of Magellan.
Dispute resolution.
The parties reiterate solemnly their commitment to preserve, strengthen and develop their unchanging ties of perpetual friendship and to refrain from resorting directly or indirectly to any form of threat or use of force and from adopting any other measures which may disturb the peace in any sector of their mutual relations. 
They create a Conciliation Commission and, if fails, eventually an Arbitral Tribunal. The decision of the tribunal shall be binding on the Parties, final and unappealable. Its implementation shall be entrusted to the honour of the nations signing the Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
The Argentine decree 256/2010.
On 17 February 2010 the Argentine executive issued the decree 256/2010 pertaining to authorisation requirements placed on shipping to and from Argentina but also to ships going through Argentine jurisdictional water heading for ports situated in the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. This decree was implemented by disposition 14/2010 of the Prefectura Naval Argentina. On 19 May 2010 the United Kingdom presented a note verbale rejecting the Argentine government’s decree and considers that “are not complaint with International Law including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ”, and with respect to the Straits of Magellan the note recalls that “the rights of international shipping to navigate these waters expeditiously and without obstacle are affirmed in the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Argentina with respect to the Straits of Magellan”. 
Article 10 of the 1984 Treaty states “The Argentine Republic undertakes to maintain, at any time and in whatever circumstances, the right of ships of all flags to navigate expeditiously and without obstacles through its jurisdictional waters to and from the Strait of Magellan”.

Daniel Murphy (baseball)

Daniel Thomas Murphy (born April 1, 1985) is an American professional baseball player. A right-handed fielder and left-handed hitter, he currently plays second base for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball.
Baseball career.
Daniel Murphy was born in Jacksonville, Florida. The Mets selected Murphy out of Jacksonville University in the 13th round (394th overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft. He spent the entire season with the High-A St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League. During home games, Murphy's walk up music includes I'm Shipping Up to Boston by Dropkick Murphys, What I've Done by Linkin Park, and This Town (O.A.R. song) by O.A.R..
2008.
Murphy began the season with the Double-A Binghamton Mets. On August 2, a day after being promoted to the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs, the Mets left-handed reserve outfielder Marlon Anderson was placed on the disabled list, so Murphy was called up to the majors. In his first major league at bat, against three-time All-Star Roy Oswalt, Murphy hit a single. Later in the same game, he made a difficult catch against the left field wall, throwing out Hunter Pence at second base for a double play to end the inning. As of August 9, 2008, Murphy was only the 5th Mets rookie to record 10 hits in his first 20 at-bats. Murphy hit his first home run in the bottom of the 6th inning against the Florida Marlins at Shea Stadium on August 9.
According to Major League Baseball rules, players are no longer considered a rookie if they have had more than 130 at-bats in a single season. Murphy had 131 at-bats for the Mets during the 2008 season, thus making 2008 his rookie season by a single at-bat. He finished the season batting .313, with 2 home runs and 17 RBI.
2009.
Although he is a natural third baseman, Murphy began to play left field in 2008, and continued in 2009, due to the presence of David Wright on the Mets. Murphy had a hard time transitioning to left field. In May, Carlos Delgado underwent hip surgery and Murphy moved to first base. Murphy led the Mets in home runs, with 12. It is tied for the fewest home runs to lead a Mets team in a single season in franchise history.
2010.
On March 30, 2010 Murphy hurt his knee in a spring training game against the St.Louis Cardinals in a rundown between third base and home plate. On June 2, while playing second base for the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, he suffered a "high-grade" MCL tear while trying to turn a double play. Although surgery was not needed, he was expected to miss 4–6 months.
2011.
During a game against rival Philadelphia Phillies on May 1, he was at bat when the fans at Citizens Bank Park started chanting "U-S-A!" in response to the news of the death of Osama bin Laden.
Murphy suffered a season-ending injury to his MCL on August 7, 2011 after a collision with the Atlanta Braves' José Constanza.
At the time of his season ending injury, Murphy had the 3rd highest batting average in the National League. However, Murphy did not have enough at-bats to qualify as a league leader at the end of the 2011 season.
2012.
Murphy started off the 2012 season as the Mets' starting second baseman after recovering from his MCL injury from 2011. On April 9th, he hit a walk-off single against the Nationals to give the Mets a 4–3 victory and their first 4–0 start since 2007. After going 352 at-bats since his last home run on July 16, 2011, Murphy hit two against the Cubs on June 27th.
2013.
Murphy had a strained muscle on his right side during spring training. He returned to training on February 20, said he didn’t have a timetable for his return to regular workouts. Murphy had a strong 2013, establishing himself as one of the best offensive 2nd baseman in the league. Murphy played in 161 games and batted .286. Murphy finished 2nd in the National League with 188 hits. Murphy also contributed 13 home runs and 78 RBIs. Murphy led the National League in stolen base success rate, swiping 23/26 bases, an 88.4 percent success rate.
Personal Life.
Daniel Murphy wed his longtime girlfriend Victoria "Tori" Ahern on December 1, 2012 in Florida.

Ambient pressure

The ambient pressure on an object is the pressure of the surrounding medium, such as a gas or liquid, which comes into contact with the object.
Atmosphere.
Within the atmosphere, the ambient pressure decreases with height above ground and by measuring ambient atmospheric pressure, a pilot may determine height (see pitot-static system). Near the ground, a change of ambient pressure of 1 millibar is taken to represent a change of height of .
Underwater.
The ambient pressure in water with a free surface is a combination of the hydrostatic pressure due to the weight of the water column and the atmospheric pressure on the free surface. This increases approximately linearly with depth. Since water is much denser than air, much greater changes in ambient pressure can be experienced under water. Each of depth adds another bar to the ambient pressure.
Ambient pressure diving is underwater diving exposed to the water pressure at depth, rather than in a pressure-excluding Atmospheric diving suit suit or submersible.
Other environments.
The concept is not limited to environments frequented by people. Almost any place in the universe will have an ambient pressure, from the hard vacuum of deep space to the interior of an exploding supernova. At extremely small scales the concept of pressure becomes irrelevant, and it is undefined at a gravitational singularity.
Units of pressure.
The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), which is a very small unit relative to atmospheric pressure on Earth, so kilopascals (kPa) are more commonly used in this context. The ambient atmospheric pressure at sea level is not constant: it varies with the weather, but averages around 100 kPa. In fields such as meteorology and scuba diving, it is common to see ambient pressure expressed in bar or millibar. One bar is 100kPa or approximately ambient pressure at sea level. Ambient pressure may in other circumstances be measured in pounds per square inch (psi) or in atmospheres (atm). One atmosphere is also approximately the ambient pressure at sea level and is equal to 14.7 psi or 1.01325 bar, which is close enough for bar and atm to be used interchangeably in many applications.
Examples of ambient pressure in various environments.
Pressures are given in terms of the normal ambient pressure experienced by humans — standard atmospheric pressure at sea level on earth.

His parents divorced in 1959 and three years later the 8-year-old Niles moved with his mother to London. He grew up in the care of his mother and stepfather, the poet, playwright and screenwriter Jesse Lasky Jr.. According to Niles in an interview with HitQuarters, they were very negative about him becoming a musician, saying, "They didn't want me to be anything like my father."
In 1975 Niles received a Degree in Composition from Boston’s Berklee College of Music where he studied with jazz greats Pat Metheny, Gary Burton, Michael Gibbs and Herb Pomeroy.
Professional career.
Returning to London in 1975, he signed to Essex Music as a writer, eventually becoming staff arranger/producer of songwriter demos for Essex and EMI Music. This indirectly led to becoming Musical Director and Arranger for Cat Stevens. On British television series for David Essex and Leo Sayer he arranged and conducted for many guest artists including Ronnie Spector, Twiggy, Kate Bush and Denny Laine. In 1978 as staff arranger for Hansa Records he discovered Sarah Brightman (then with dance troupe Hot Gossip) and arranged both his and her first hit "I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper".
Since then he has composed, arranged and produced music for some of the world’s most creative and successful artists. Niles has arranged for great female stars Pet Clark, Cilla Black, Kim Wilde, Lulu, Randy Crawford, Anita Baker, Deniece Williams, Gloria Gaynor, Heather Small and Samantha Mumba. He arranged the legendary Grace Jones album "Slave to the Rhythm" and a swinging big band version of "Better the Devil You Know" for Kylie Minogue’s 2001 tour.

Tatul Krpeyan

Tatul Krpeyan () was the commander of Armenian paramilitary units in Getashen-Martunashen villages in Khanlar Rayon of Azerbaijan during the Nagorno-Karabakh war, from September 1990 until May 1991. 
Tatul was born on 21 April 1965 in the village of Areg near the town of Talin, Armenia. He completed his elementary and intermediary education in the Technical School of Talin, where he graduated magna cum laude. After serving in the Soviet army, in 1987 he entered the Faculty of History of Yerevan State University. In his first year at the university, Tatul joined the Armenian-liberation movement. He was also a member of the "Meiatsoom" (Unification) organization, whose efforts were directed to unite Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia.
In September 1990, he travelled to Nagorno-Karabakh, where the situation continued to deteriorate. Joining the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Tatul has founded the "Dashnaktsakanner" unit of volunteers in Karabakh.
Tatul headed the self-defense of the sub-district Getashen-Martunashen from September 1990 until May 1991 against Azerbaijani armed forces units and police detachments (OMON). Krpeyan was killed on 30 April 1991 in Getashen during the Operation Ring. He received the highest title in Armenia, the National Hero of Armenia award in 1996. He was buried in Areg, which has been renamed after the hero – Tatul . A tuffaceous monument has been erected in memory of Tatul. The sculptor of the monument is Tariel Hakobian.
Operation Ring.
In the spring of 1991 the main battleground of partisan war was the wooded hills to the north of Nagorno-Karabakh where fighters from Armenia infiltrated to Armenian inhabited villages. Tatul Krpeyan led his people to Getashen and Martunashen. On 10 April 1991 the decision was made by the authorities to start operation against these villages.
The Moscow-based human rights group Memorial has reconstructed what happened. On 30 April 1991, 4th Army soldiers and then the Azerbaijani OMON entered Getashen near Shahumian, where Krpeyan was killed, and his people took several soldiers hostage. The OMON raided and looted houses and attacked many of the inhabitants. The dozen or so killed were in their eighties and nineties.
Taking Mashkov prisoner and the Death.
From the memoirs of G. Gyurjyan: “Together with Grachev Tatul decided to move forward, holding Mashkov under the gun to make sure that the tanks were leaving the village. Despite the order not to follow them, his deputy, Arthur Karapetyan did follow him, so that, in case of emergency to protect the commander. Mashkov all the time passed the order not to shoot and not to move forward. On their way, they met with tanks and OMON. And here Mashkov managed to lean aside, leaving Tatul defenseless: Tatul was shot at once. Hrach and Arthur, who tried to save Krpeyan, were also killed... Thus Tatul died - a man with an unusually big heart and courage. 
Legacy.
Many works of art in the modern history of Armenia are dedicated to Tatul Krpeyan. In 2004 Rafayel Sahakian has published a fictional documentary book named Artsvapasht Yerkir (Eagle-idolizing land), dedicated to Tatul Krpeyan. The song "Leran Lanjin" ("Piedmont") was composed by Nersik Ispiryan. "Mayramut Ijav" ("At Sunset") was composed by Ashusgh Gevorg, as well as Ashot Babayan's sonata for cello and piano in 1993, were all reportedly dedicated to Tatul Krpeyan's memory.

Medical Council of Canada

Medical Council of Canada (MCC) "(French: Le Conseil médical du Canada)" is an organization that is charged with assessing medical candidates, evaluation of physicians through exams and granting a qualification called Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC) to those who wish to practice medicine in Canada.
MCC is governed by a 51-member Executive Board of Council, who meets once a year to discuss budgets, policies and assets. The day-to-day operation is carried out by the Executive Director, currently Dr. M. Ian Bowmer.
History.
Founded by the "Canada Medical Act" in 1912 through the effort of Sir Thomas Roddick, a physician and Member of Parliament, who have been pursuing a standardized licensing scheme in Canada for over 18 years.
Beginning April 1912, MCC gave the right to practice throughout Canada, to be admitted to the British Medical Register (BMR) to serve in the medical forces of the army and navy. The practice for registering physicians into the BMR eventually ceased but those who wish to practice in the UK can register themselves with the General Medical Council.
Examinations.
A pass standing is required on both the QE Part I and the QE Part II in order to be awarded Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada. LMCC is recognized by the 12 medical licensing authorities in Canada, and is one of the requirements for the issuance of a license to practice medicine in Canada.
Licentiate.
Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada, commonly abbreviated as LMCC, is a physician that, according to the bylaws of MCC:
Canadian Medical Register.
MCC also maintains the Canadian Medical Register, a list of physicians who have completed or exempted from the LMCC requirement. This is the first step for medical graduates who wish to obtain license to practice prior to applying to their own regulatory body in their home province or territory.

All academic education institutions are the responsibility of the provincial governments. The federal government mostly assists in curriculum development, accreditation and some financing of research.
Early education.
A child may begin his/her schooling at a pre-school at the age of 3. Over the last few years, many new kindergarten (sometimes called montessori) schools have also sprung up in Karachi. Usually pre-school Muslim children get Islamic education of Quran and Hadis at home or local Masjid or Madrasahs.

Vera Cordeiro

Vera Cordeiro (born 1950 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is a social entrepreneur and physician.
She worked as a general practitioner for 20 years at Hospital da Lagoa, a public hospital which serves some of Rio de Janeiro’s poorest areas including the Baixada Fluminense (lowland slums) and Rocinha (Latin America’s largest favela).
Children are typically hospitalized, suffering from serious cases of pneumonia, tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, anaemia and others, and subsequently released without having the necessary resources to continue their treatment at home. Being released into the conditions that make children sick in the first place results in a constant hospital admission/re-admission cycle.
In 1991, Cordeiro founded Brazil Child Health (Associação Saúde Criança, formerly Renascer), whose mission is to provide holistic assistance to children and their families who live below the poverty line. It works in conjunction with public hospitals in Brazil in order to promote the self-sustainable, biopsychosocial well-being of the entire family. Her comprehensive approach engages health professionals to identify at-risk families and mobilizes a cadre of volunteers to work one-on-one with each family to take charge of transforming their lives. It has been shown that Saude Criança’s model can reduce hospitalization rates by 60%, increase the income of assisted families by more than 35%, and lead to significant annual savings in public spending. 23 hospitals in six Brazilian states have already implemented the association´s methodology.
So far her work has directly transformed the lives of 40,000 of the severely poor and marginalized. In recent years, Dr. Cordeiro began taking her social franchise model to a new level, working with health policymakers to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of her model as a strategy for guaranteeing children’s right to health and combating poverty. As a result, Dr. Cordeiro’s methodology has been integrated into the public policy of one of Brazil’s largest cities, Belo Horizonte.
Due to its transparency, social impact, and the applicability of its methodology, Saúde Criança has garnered much international recognition. As the Bengali economist and banker Muhammad Yunus, 2006 Nobel Prize winner, once said: “Saúde Criança is a powerful social inclusion methodology.’’
Vera Cordeiro, founder and CEO of the organization, is an , Schwab Foundation and Skoll Foundation Social Entrepreneur, as well as an Avina leader. Amongst the many awards obtained by the organization, it is worth mentioning the Global Development Network Award, received by Saúde Criança in 2003 after competing against 400 organizations from all over the world. In 2012, Associação Saúde Criança was ranked the best Brazilian organization and 38th among the top 100 NGOs in the world by The Global Journal.

Mike Paul

Michael George Paul (born April 18, 1945 in Detroit, Michigan) is a former left-handed Major League Baseball pitcher who played from 1968 to 1974 for the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers and Chicago Cubs. 
Drafted in the 20th round of the 1967 amateur draft out of the University of Arizona by the Indians, Paul had success in the minors and in less than two years was in a big league uniform. In 1967, he spent time with the Reno Silver Sox and Portland Beavers. With the Silver Sox, he went 3–2 with a 1.63 ERA. In 72 innings (nine games), he struck out 103 batters. He didn't do as well with the Beavers, going 2–4 with a 3.94 ERA with them. However, he did strikeout 37 batters in 32 innings of work. Overall, Paul went 5–6 with a 2.34 ERA. He struck out 140 batters in 104 innings of work (18 games). 
Paul again pitched for Reno in 1968, going 2–1 with a 1.09 ERA and 49 strikeouts in four games (33 innings). He was called up to the major leagues and on May 27, he made his big league debut. He performed well in his first appearances, going 2 innings, striking out four (including the first batter he faced, Frank Kostro), allowing only one hit and earning the save. Overall, Paul went 5–8 with a 3.93 ERA in 91 innings of work in his rookie season. He allowed only 72 hits in 36 games (seven starts) and he walked 35 batters.
Despite posting a 3.61 ERA for the 62–99 Indians in 1969, his record was only 5–10. In 47 games (12 starts), he struck out 98 batters. He went only 2–8 with a 4.81 ERA in 30 games (15 starts) in 1970. His performance was so unimpressive in fact that he spent 10 games in the minors with the Wichita Aeros, with whom he went 6–1 with a 2.15 ERA in 71 innings of work. In 1971, he went only 2–7 with a 5.95 ERA in 17 games (12 starts), and he again spent time with Wichita, going 6–7 with a 4.37 ERA in 17 games (107 innings).
On December 2, 1971, Paul was traded with Roy Foster, Rich Hand and Ken Suarez to the Rangers for Del Unser, Denny Riddleberger, Terry Ley and Gary Jones.
Paul had the best year of his career with Texas in 1972, going 8–9 with a 2.17 ERA in 49 games (20 starts). In 161 innings, he allowed only 149 hits, and he struck out 108 batters. His 2.17 ERA was sixth best in the league, and his 139 Adjusted ERA+ was sixth best as well.
He began the 1973 season with the Rangers, going 5–4 with a 4.95 ERA in 36 games (10 starts). On August 31, he was sent to the Cubs for a player to be named later, which ended up being Larry Gura. He made 11 appearances (one start) for the Cubs that year, going 0–1 with a 3.44 ERA. Overall, Paul went 5–5 with a 4.68 ERA in 1973. 
1974 would end up being Paul's final season in the major leagues. He appeared in only two games, allowing four earned runs in 1 innings of work for a 27.00 ERA. He played his final game on April 16, against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
After being released by the Cubs, Paul played in the Mexican League until 1982. 
In his major league career, Paul went 27–48 with a 3.91 ERA in 228 appearances (77 starts). In 627 innings, he walked 246 batters and struck out 452. As a batter, Paul hit .115 in 148 at-bats.

Operation Michoacán

Operation Michoacán was a joint operation by Federal Police, and the Mexican military, to eliminate drug plantations and to combat drug trafficking. Initiated on December 11, 2006, the operation was supervised by The Secretary of Public Safety, Attorney General of Mexico (PGR), Secretary of the Interior, Mexican Navy, and Mexican Army.
On some occasions state and municipal police have participated despite not being part of it. The joint operation has distinguished itself as one of the operations against organized crime, drug trafficking in this case, which has employed the largest number of military and police elements, as well as most state forces.
Background.
Following up on an operation planned by predecessor, Vincente Fox, on December 12, President Felipe Calderón ordered the military to send 4,000 troops to his home state of Michoacán, where drug-related crime had left over 500 dead. Troops were assigned to areas under the control of organized criminals, conducting raids, making arrests and establishing control points on highways and secondary roads. In 2007 May 8 in Apatzingan, Michoacán, Soldiers from the 51st Infantry Battalion engaged drug traffickers. Soldiers driving HMMWV armed with Mk 19 grenade launchers killed 4 cartel gunmen, 3 soldiers were reported wounded.
Controversy.
Operation Michoacán is the first stage of the so-called War Against Drug Trafficking implemented by the federal government of President Felipe Calderón. The joint operation has been questioned about the human rights violations that may have occurred, given the military presence among the civilian population of the state of Michoacán. The chairman of the National Commission on Human Rights, José Luis Soberanes, in May 2007, charged that had been at least 53 complaints of human rights violations by the military to the civilian population.

<doc id="18695223" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18695223" title="Latvian constitutional referendum, 2008">
Latvian constitutional referendum, 2008

A constitutional referendum to amend the constitution of Latvia in order to allow one-tenth of the total registered electorate to initiate a popular referendum to dissolve the Latvian parliament was held in Latvia on 2 August 2008. 
The referendum on this issue was triggered when the Government of Latvia voted against an opposition motion to adopt this change to the constitution, which resulted in a referendum in Latvia by law. President Valdis Zatlers and the left-wing opposition were in favour of the referendum, while the government was against it, arguing that it would cause even more instability in a country which has seen 13 governments in the 18 years since independence. At least half of the total registered electorate (i.e. more than 757,607) had to approve the referendum proposal in order for it to be valid.
Preliminary results indicated that an overwhelming 96% of voters had voted in favour of the amendment, although only about 40% of the electorate voted in favour, which means the referendum is invalid. It is expected that the strong result, while failing to directly change the constitution, might press politicians to adopt a similar measure nonetheless.
If passed, the amendment would have represented the first time in an EU country that voters would have been able to dissolve their national parliament - a right traditionally reserved for the head of state.
Background.
The moves to initiate the referendum began in Autumn 2007 at a time of public discontent with the government which had led to the largest street protests to date in the post-Soviet era. 
The movement to organise the referendum was led by the Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia. The referendum also took place at a time of poor economic indicators with inflation exceeding 17 percent and economic growth expected to fall to near zero. 
Procedure for calling a referendum.
Under the ‘Latvian Law on National Referendums and Legislative Initiatives’, the procedure on calling popular referendums has several stages. The first stage involves the collection of 10,000 signatures certified by notaries, which are then presented to the Latvian Central Election Commission (CEC). Following positive verification of these signatures, the Latvian Government must then provide facilities for signature gathering in every town and village in the country, to enable the population to sign in favour of a proposal for a referendum.
In order to be successful, more than one-tenth of citizens eligible to vote in the previous parliamentary elections must sign in favour. Again, the signatures are verified by the CEC. If the 10% threshold is met, then the draft amendments are presented to the president who submits them to parliament for approval. If two thirds of MPs approve the changes at a sitting in which at least two thirds of the parliament is present then the changes are passed into law without the need for a referendum. If parliament rejects the laws, then a referendum is held. 
Collection of signatures.
In the event, 11,095 signatures were initially collected and positively verified. Collection of further signatures then took place from March 12 to April 10, 2008 in 660 designated places, of which 40 were abroad. In total, counting the initial signatures, 217,567 voters supported the introduction of the draft amendments. A further 6,814 signatures were disqualified. In the vast majority of cases this was due to citizens signing more than once. However, 35 were disqualified due to not being Latvian citizens, 22 on the grounds of insanity, 62 who were deceased or could not be identified and 1 person who was under the age of 18 upon signing. 
As the total number of valid signatures represented 14.6% of the electorate, the amendments were duly presented by the president to parliament, which rejected them on 5 June 2008. Accordingly under the terms of the referendum law, a referendum had to be held not earlier than one month and not later than two months after rejection. 
Referendum campaign.
"No" campaign.
Opposing the referendum, Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis pointed out that political instability had also been a feature of pre-Soviet Latvia. He also argued that “Electing the parliament is a creative process, while a referendum would be a destructive process without any result." Parliamentary speaker Gundars Daudze argued that such referendums could create a huge crisis with neither parliament nor president operating. Meanwhile the head of the People's Party in parliament, Māris Kučinskis, stated his belief that such referendums would allow a small number of people to change the election results. The advertisements of the no campaign also played on fears of Russian influence, with one advertisement, illustrated by pictures of ethnic Russian politicians from the opposition left wing parties playing a balalaika in a sauna, declaring “If you vote tomorrow, then you, brother, are crazy. In our places, the Russians will come. The Russians will come.” 
"Yes" campaign.
Former Prime Minister Einars Repše, a member of the opposition New Era party, argued that a yes vote of the majority of the electorate would be in accordance with basic democratic principles and that many contemporary Latvian politicians were working not for the state interest but for the interest of “Godfathers.” Civic Union party leader Sandra Kalniete also called for a yes vote on the grounds that the amendments could force MPs “to finally listen to the will of their voters.” For Human Rights in United Latvia MP Juris Sokolovskis supported a yes vote on the basis of perceived alienation of the electorate from their MPs and on the grounds that, even if the 50% quorum was not reached, a large yes majority would still be difficult for politicians to ignore. 
Reactions.
Following the anticipated large yes vote, President Valdis Zatlers said the support shown was strong enough to prompt Parliament to adopt similar amendments on its own. "The rights of the people to dissolve the Parliament have to be included in the Constitution as soon as possible," Zatlers was quoted as saying by local news agency BNS. "If 40% want that, the duty of the Parliament is making it possible."

Hydro Ottawa

Hydro Ottawa is an electricity distribution company based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. As of 2010, Hydro Ottawa provides power to over 296,000 customers in Ottawa and Casselman.
History.
Hydro Ottawa was formed in 2000 when five municipal local distribution companies were merged. The history of the supply of electricity began in the 1880s with private electrical suppliers, became public in the early 1900s and continued in competition with private suppliers, chiefly those of Thomas Ahearn and his companies, until the 1950s.
In 1882, Electric lighting in Ottawa started in at Young's mill in Lebreton Flats (the previous year had seen Eddy's mill lit by electricity, on the Hull side). A year later, the House of Commons and the Senate were illuminated.
The first electric street lighting in Canada occurred on Victoria Day, 1884 when the Peterborough Light and Power Company lit 17 arc lights on George Street in Peterborough Ontario. In 1885, the Royal Electric Company (of Montreal, formed in 1884) set up street lighting systems in Charlottetown and St. John's, Newfoundland. Ottawa had originally intended on using this company to light the city's streets, however, council contracted Ottawa Electric Light Company (formed 1884) to install 165 arc lamps on the city's streets. That company, which had as a director one of its founders Francis Clemow, along with founder lumber baron G. B. Pattee, had built a power station which used a water-powered generator. In May 1885, the streets of Ottawa were lit by electricity.
In 1887, the Chaudière Electric Light and Power Company was formed by Thomas Ahearn, a local man and partner of Ahearn and Soper, formed in the early 1880s. In 1890, there were two electrical providers, (Clemow's) Ottawa Electric Light Company, and Ahearn's company, Chaudière Electric Light and Power Company.
In 1894 Ahearn merged Ottawa Electric Light Company, and Chaudière Electric Light and Power Company, and bought out Standard Electric Company of Ottawa (Limited) in the process, naming it Ottawa Electric Company, creating a virtual monopoly on electrical services in Ottawa. (Erskine Henry Bronson played a role in the development of this company).
The following decades would see a continuous struggle between the City of Ottawa and Thomas Ahearn regarding the supplying of electricity to the city. In 1899 (possibly 1901), a charter was granted by the city to Consumers Electric, a rival company to Ahearn's Ottawa Electric Company. In 1905, The City purchased Consumers Electric for $200,000, ending Ahearn's ongoing attempts at acquiring the company. They renamed it "Municipal Electric Department" which was the city's public electricity provider.
In 1908 Ahearn and Soper bought the Ottawa Gas Company, and with the Ottawa Electric Company formed the Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company Limited. This parent holding company wholly owned the two previous companies and would refer to Ottawa Electric as its "Ottawa Electric division" well into the new century. This meant that there were no longer outside shareholders to Ottawa Electric, but there were shareholders to Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company.
In 1915 the "Municipal Electric Department" became Ottawa Hydro; named as the "Ottawa Hydro Electric Commission", when it joined forces with the provincial network of the Ontario Hydro Electric Commission.
In 1920 Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company Limited acquired the assets of The Ottawa Power Company, Limited which included the power plant at Victoria Island (Ottawa River) erected in 1900.
In 1950 Ottawa Hydro acquired the "Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company, Limited", removing the last private sector competitor.
Hydro Ottawa was formed in 2000 when five municipal local distribution companies were merged: Gloucester Hydro, Goulbourn Hydro, Kanata Hydro, Nepean Hydro and Ottawa Hydro. In May 2002, Casselman Hydro also became a part of Hydro Ottawa.
Ottawa Hydro Electric Company Building - 109 Bank Street.
Ottawa Hydro Electric Company Building (Bridgehead at street level) is a Heritage building in Ottawa located at 109 Bank Street, on the south-east corner of Albert Street. It was designated as under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1992. It commissioned W. C. Beattie to design this Art Deco style office building in 1934. It was Ottawa Hydro's headquarters until 1957.
Current services.
Hydro Ottawa provides electricity supply to its customers, by taking electricity from the provincial grid and distributing it to homes and businesses.
Hydro Ottawa also offers programs to help customers conserve electricity.

The House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (also known as the House of Coburg-Braganza) was a dynasty descended through a distaff line of the House of Braganza that ruled the Kingdom of Portugal from 1853 until the declaration of the republic in 1910.
The designation Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is prevalent mainly in the writings of non-Portuguese historians and genealogists, due to the last four Kings of Portugal descending from Queen Maria II of Portugal, from the House of Braganza, and Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. European custom classifies a descendant branch on the basis of patrilineal descent, which means that the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is a cadet branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and therefore of the House of Wettin.
Nonetheless, the Portuguese constitution stated that the House of Braganza was the ruling house of Portugal, by way of Queen Maria II, and her descendants still continued to style themselves as members of the House of Braganza, as opposed to Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Braganza.
As there are no living descendants left in Portugal, the claim to the crown of Portugal is again with the House of Braganza.
History.
The royal house was founded by Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who on 9 April 1836 married Queen Maria II of Portugal from the House of Braganza. Members of the royal house held the title Infante (or Infanta) of Portugal and Duke (or Duchess) of Saxony. On 15 November 1853, Queen Maria II died, and her eldest son succeeded to the throne as Pedro V, the first king of the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty.
The dynasty remained on the throne until the outbreak in Portugal of the 5 October 1910 revolution when King Manuel II was deposed and the Portuguese First Republic was established. Manuel II went into exile in England, and, with his death on 2 July 1932, the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha became extinct.
Before his death, King Manuel II reconciled with the rival Miguelist branch of the House of Braganza, who had claimed the Portuguese throne since 1834, in opposition to the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty. So, with his death, the claim to the throne of Portugal passed to the pretender, Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza.
The "Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Braganza" surname was also used by Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança, a woman who claimed to be a bastard daughter of King Carlos I.

La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France

La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France (Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France) is a collaborative artists' book by Blaise Cendrars and Sonia Delaunay-Terk. The book features a poem by Cendrars about a journey through Russia on the Trans-Siberian Express in 1905, during the first Russian Revolution, interlaced with an almost-abstract pochoir print by Delaunay-Terk. The work, published in 1913, is considered a milestone in the evolution of artist's books as well as modernist poetry and abstract art.
The publisher of a 2008 reprint of the book has called it "one of the most beautiful books ever created". Cendrars himself referred to the work as ‘a sad poem printed on sunlight’.
Cendrars and the New Man Press.
Blaise Cendrars was the nom-de-plume for Fréderic Louis Sauser, a play on Braise (fire) and Cendres (ash); 'writing is being burned alive, but it also means being reborn from the ashes'. Born in Switzerland, at 15 he had run away from home to train as an apprentice jeweller in St Petersburg, but continued to travel, including an important stay in New York where he wrote his first major poem "Les Pâques à New York", 1912, before settling in Paris.
Once in Paris, he started a small press, "Éditions des Hommes Nouveaux" (New Man Editions) with the help of an anarchist who owned a clandestine printing press at the Mouzaïa Quarter, 19th arrondissement. His first edition, 125 copies of "Les Pâques à New York", was published October 1912. Despite failing to sell a single copy, he pressed ahead with the second book, "La prose du Transsibérien", published June 1913 (see 1913 in poetry). Intended as an edition of 150, only 60 copies were printed, of which about 30 are thought to survive. The book, a series of 4 sheets glued together in an accordion-style binding, measures 199 cm tall when unfolded; the height of all 150 end to end would have equalled the height of the Eiffel Tower, a potent symbol of modernity at the time, and referenced in both the poem and the print.
"poem describes the 16-year old poet’s epic, perhaps imaginary, train journey from Moscow to Harbin (in Mongolia) during the Russo-Japanese War and the Russian Revolution of 1905. The route is shown on the contemporary map printed at the top right of the sheet. It is a long, oppressive ride through Russia with apocalyptic scenes of war and revolution, and descriptions of cold, hunger, death and devastation which worsen as the train follows its eastward course and are punctuated by the repeated, melancholy question of Jehanne, the poet's companion, "Dis Blaise, sommes nous bien loin de Montmartre?" (Blaise, are we very far from Montmartre?')" Chris Michaelides
The book is an early example of the deliberate use of multiple fonts - twelve in all - in different sizes and colours to suggest movement and differing moods, contemporaneous to similar experiments by the Italian futurists. It is also unusual for 'defying the codex form' and for placing the images on an equal footing to the text; they run parallel and complementary to the text, rather than as illustrative or decorative additions.
Simultaneity and the Parisian Avant-Garde.
It was through Guillaume Apollinaire, a mutual friend, that Cendrars was to meet Sonia and her husband Robert Delaunay, members of the Parisian avant-garde, leading exponents of cubism, and inventors of the term "Simultaneity".
The Delaunays had coined the word from their study of Chevreul's laws of simultaneous contrast. This new style had first appeared in April 1912 with Robert Delaunay's series of paintings of "Fenêtres" (Windows) followed closely by Sonia's abstract "Contrastes Simultanés" and was boldly taken up by both husband and wife for the rest of their careers. 
"The intensity of the colour field is heightened in accordance with the law of simultaneous contrast: orange seen next to green becomes more red, while green seen next to orange appears more blue. These constant two-way influences create an unusual vibration in the eye of the viewer. Delaunay read this phenomenon as movement and rhythm and understood it as the painting appropriate to a modern society in motion." 
The series of "Windows", with their use of the Eiffel Tower as the central theme, were a direct influence on Sonia's contributions to the poem; again, the eye was supposed to move between elements of the picture and the words creating a sensation of speed and disorientation that echoed the poem's theme of travel. The book is contained in a wrapper which declares it the "first simultaneous book'. It also contains a map of Siberia at the beginning of the book, showing the route of the train journey.
Reception of the Book.
When published, the book was to cause a sensation in the avant-garde circles in Paris. Many, if not most, of the surviving copies are now held by major museums and libraries, including the V&A, Tate Modern, MOMA, the Hermitage, Swiss National Library, New York Public Library, Getty Research Institute, and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas.
It is often exhibited framed, removing it from its origins as an artist's book. Copies are also occasionally referred to as unique paintings.

John Cropper

John Cropper (1797–1876) was a British philanthropist and abolitionist. A businessman, he was known as ""the most generous man in Liverpool"".
Business and philanthropy.
Cropper was renowned for being rich, but also being generous. It is said that a letter addressed to ""the most generous man in Liverpool"" ended up on his desk. Every year he and his wife would entertain juvenile delinquents who were serving their sentences at the training ship ""Akbar"". Cropper would also hold a bible class every Sunday at a home the family had set up for "fallen girls." This was in addition to the ragged school they set up for local pauper's children. This school was known as "St. Croppers" and is likely to be the one referred to in the poem below.
In 1836, his father's partner, Robert Rathbone Benson (known as "Robert R"), had resigned membership from the Quakers. This was no small affair as the Quaker church was the centre of its members community. Benson was involved with, and related to, Isaac Crewdson (a leader to the Manchester Quaker meeting). Crewdson had written and published a book in January 1835 called "". The controversy it ignited, which related to the role of evangelism in the Society, eventually led to the resignation of Crewdson and about 300 similarly minded people across the country. Benson moved to Manchester.
It was because of this internal controversy that on 31 January 1838, John Cropper's father James Cropper ended the partnership of Cropper, Benson & Co. which had made the family rich and wealthy. His father wanted to direct his energies to philanthropic interests and his two sons, John and Edward, had agreed.
In 1840, John Cropper journeyed to London to attend the World's anti-slavery convention on 12 June 1840. The picture above shows him in a painting made to commemorate the event which attracted delegates from America, France, Haiti, Australia, Ireland, Jamaica and Barbados.
Cropper joined the committee of the Liverpool City Mission and served as its President from 1847 to 1874.
In 1853 Harriett Beecher Stowe visited England and stayed first at John Cropper's house, Dingle Bank. On 23 September 1853 Cropper's third son, John Wakefield Cropper, married Susanna Elizabeth Lydia Arnold. Susanna was third daughter of the late Dr Arnold of Rugby School 
Family.
Cropper was born to James and Mary Cropper in 1797. Cropper married Anne Wakefield and they had ten children. Mary (1821-1885) married John Saul Howson; James (1823-1900); Sarah (1824-1890); Anne (born 1825); John Wakefield (1828-1829); John Wakefield (1830-1892); Isabella (1831-1831); Edward William (born 1833); Isabella Eliza (born 1835); Margaret (born 1836).
Poem.
<poem> 
He lived at Dingle Bank - he did; -
He lived at Dingle Bank;
And in his garden was one Quail,
Four tulips and a Tank:
And from his window he could see
The otion and the River Dee.
His house stood on a Cliff, - it did,
Its aspic it was cool;
And many thousand little boys
Resorted to his school,
Where if of progress they could boast
He gave them heaps of buttered toast.
But he grew rabid-wroth, he did,
If they neglected books,
And dragged them to adjacent Cliffs
With beastly Button Hooks,
And there with fatuous glee he threw
Them down into the otion blue.
And in the sea they sway, they did, -
All playfully about,
And some eventually became
Sponges, or speckled trout: -
But Liverpool doth all bewail
Their Fate; - likewise his Garden Quail.

Macro-Puinavean languages

Macro-Puinavean is a hypothetical proposal linking some very poorly attested languages to the Nadahup family. The Puinave language is sometimes linked specifically with the Nadahup languages ( "Maku"), as Puinave–Maku, and the Maku language of Roraima is sometimes connected to the Arutani–Sape languages (yet again also known as "Maku") in a "Kalianan" branch, a connection which Kaufman (1990) finds "promising", but there is too little data on these languages to know for sure. Hodï has been proposed specifically as a sister of Puinave–Nadahup.
Epps (2008) criticizes the Puinave–Nadahup proposal for relying on inaccurate data, having no clear concept of basic vocabulary, and using an unsystematic mix of Nadahup languages in the comparison. The languages were originally linked simply because they are all called "Maku" "babble" by Arawakans; that is, because they are spoken by hunter-gatherers, and since then some linguists have attempted to verify the connection by finding cognates. However, no convincing cognates have yet been found. For example, Rivet and Tastevin claim that the Hup pronoun "am" "I" corresponds to Puinave "am" "I", but the Hup pronoun "’am" actually means "you"; the Hup pronoun for "I" is "’ãh". Other "strikingly similar" pairs, such as Puinave "ueyu" "day" and Hup "uerhó" (actually "") "sun", are not particularly convincing, and no regular sound correspondences have been detected.

Carl August Hagberg

Carl August Hagberg (7 July 1810 – 9 January 1864), was a Swedish linguist and translator. He was a member of the Swedish Academy, occupying seat 7 from 1851 until his death. He was the son of Carl Peter Hagberg.
Hagberg is most famous for being the first person to produce a Swedish translation of the "Complete Works of Shakespeare", the twelve volumes of his translation was issued between 1847 and 1851. Several of his translations were, however, based on the work of Johan Henrik Thomander, who had produced a collected edition of "Antony and Cleopatra", "As You Like It", "The Merry Wives of Windsor", "Richard II" and "Twelfth Night" in 1825.
Hagberg was a student at Uppsala University, and became a professor of Ancient Greek there in 1833. Upon his father's advice, he spent 1835 and 1836 travelling in Germany and France. During this time he met notable writers from both countries, including: Victor Hugo, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Ludwig Tieck. Upon his return to Sweden, Hagberg became a strong advocate of English and French literature – at the time Swedish universities were dominated by German influences. In 1837 he wrote "Om den nya franska vitterheten", an essay surveying contemporary French literature.
Hagberg was a professor of aesthetics and modern languages at Lund University from 1840 to 1859, when he became a professor of Nordic languages at the same university. He was one of the most famous public speakers of his day. In 1853 he was asked to make the public address at the unveiling of the statue of Esaias Tegnér at Lund Cathedral. From 1862 to 1863 he was the inspektor of Småland Nation, Lund. He was succeeded by Theodor Wisén as the chair of Scandinavian languages at Lund University.

In High Places (Turtledove)

In High Places is an alternate history novel by Harry Turtledove. It is a part of the Crosstime Traffic series, and takes place in an alternate world where the Black Death was much more virulent, resulting in a Europe largely decimated and subsequently populated by Muslims.
Plot summary.
The book focuses on the relations between Christians and Muslims, as well as slaves and masters, in the medieval society through the eyes of Annette, an eighteen-year-old time traveller from the late 21st century who poses as the daughter of a Muslim merchant and who is captured and sold into slavery. It is also the first book in the series to concentrate more upon the late 21st-century origins of the Crosstime Traffic organization.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" in their review said "Turtledove convincingly portrays the conflict between Christians and Muslims, but takes less care in depicting male-and-female relationships. Didactic pronouncements on slavery notwithstanding, the book should satisfy its target audience of younger readers." Roland J. Green in his review for "Booklist" said that "although the last third is a bit jumbled, this is the best Crosstime Traffic yarn to date, featuring, besides two engaging protagonists, extensive exploration of the ethical issues of slavery."

Molly Sweeney

Molly Sweeney is a two-act play by Brian Friel. It tells the story of its title character, Molly, a woman blind since infancy, who undergoes an operation to try to restore her sight. Like Friel's "Faith Healer", the play tells Molly's story through monologues by three characters, in this case Molly, her husband Frank, and her surgeon, Mr. Rice.
Production history.
"Molly Sweeney" received its first performance on August 9, 1994 at the Gate Theatre, Dublin. It was directed by Friel and featured Catherine Byrne as Molly, Mark Lambert as Frank Sweeney, and T. P. McKenna as Mr. Rice.
It received its American premiere in 1996 in an Off Broadway production at the Roundabout Theatre. Catherine Byrne again starred as Molly, Alfred Molina played her husband Frank, and Jason Robards played Mr. Rice. It won the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Play of the 1996 season.
The play was revived at the Print Room theatre in west London in 2013, with Dorothy Duffy in the titular role. 
The play was in large part inspired by the essay by neurologist Oliver Sacks, "To See and Not See," published in "An Anthropologist on Mars".

Kiki (1931 film)

Kiki is a 1931 romantic comedy starring Mary Pickford and Reginald Denny, directed by Sam Taylor. The film is a remake of the 1926 version starring Norma Talmadge. 
Plot.
Kiki (Mary Pickford) is a hapless French chorus girl who has just been fired from her job. She doesn't accept it and goes to see producer Victor Randall (Reginald Denny). He, however, is really busy and is annoyed by her presence. To get her out of his office, he promises her job back. Before she leaves, she drops her purse and clippings of Victor shaped in hearts fall out. It becomes clear Kiki is secretly in love with him.
When the next show becomes a disaster because of Kiki, she is again fired. She goes complaining at Victor Randall's office for the second time. He is now charmed by her and invites Kiki to his apartment. There, she notices a photo of his ex-wife Paulette Vaile (Margaret Livingston). He kisses her, but she is insulted and slaps him. She hides in another room and makes clear she feels used and thinks Victor is still not over Paulette. 
She eventually falls asleep in the room and finds a letter from Paulette the next morning. Although it's for Victor, she reads it. It says she is sorry about last night and wants to make up with Victor. Kiki becomes jealous and ruins the letter. Meanwhile, the servants are irritated by Kiki and try to get her out of Victor's apartment. Victor confronts her when the servants inform him Kiki has stolen a few of Paulette's letters. He eventtually finds the letters and reads them.
Victor and Kiki have a conversation and flirt for the first time. Kiki becomes angry when Victor receives a phone call from Paulette and answers it. Paulette later visits Victor's apartment. Kiki is outraged and tells Paulette she is in love with Victor and intends to marry him. Victor catches Kiki intimidating and scaring Paulette and orders her to get out.
Victor and Paulette fall in love with each other again, but they find out Kiki hasn't left the apartment. Kiki pretends to be unconscious. Victor puts her in bed to rest and Kiki kisses him. He tells Paulette he can't leave Kiki alone. Paulette feels betrayed and leaves him. Victor and Kiki finally fall in love and kiss.
Release.
The film was released in 1931. New York Times film critic Mordaunt Hall credited the film for its comedy and characterizations of the stars in the movie; however longtime Pickford fans were not used to the loose adult role that the star traded for her earlier ingenuousness and it eventually flopped at the box office. 
A copy of the film still exists at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. However, it has not been released on home video or DVD, the only Mary Pickford talkie not to be released.

Curious Notions

Curious Notions is an alternate history novel by Harry Turtledove. It is a part of the Crosstime Traffic series. In "Curious Notions", the Central Powers won World War I prior to the United States entering the war. Subsequently, the German Empire invaded and conquered the United States in the 1950s. The story is set 150 years later, in German-occupied San Francisco. The main plot deals with time travelers from our universe establishing an electronics shop in San Francisco, coming under the suspicion of both the German authorities and the tongs while preventing the Germans from duplicating the time travel technology.
Lead Up to the Plot.
The Central Powers win by managing to knock out France and the British Expeditionary Force in the west towards the beginning of the war. Then they defeated the Russian Empire before the United States intervened. A few years later, the German Empire intervenes in the Russian Revolution and defeats the Bolsheviks, but the Russian Empire is mostly divided and therefore no longer a power. Britain and France tried to stop Germany's power again in the 1940s but since the United States did not intervene, they lost and Germany had control over Europe and its sphere of influence. Since Germany never persecuted the Jewish peoples of their country, they discovered the atomic bomb and had further dominance. The United States was largely ignorant of the power of these bombs and as a result lost World War III when it broke out in 1956. It resulted in the nuclear destruction of most of the United States. San Francisco, the setting, is intact because the United States got lucky and was able to shoot some of the German bombers down.
Literary significance and reception.
Roland J. Green reviewing for Booklist said that this novel had a "well-constructed world, superior characterization, and some serious analysis of the ethics of cross-time travel all make the yarn a winner."

Smolyan dialect

The Smolyan dialect or Central Rhodope dialect is a Bulgarian dialect of the Rhodopean group of the Rup dialects. Its range includes most of the Central Rhodopes, i.e. the region of Smolyan. Its immediate neighbours are the Rhodopean Hvoyna dialect to the north, the Serres-Nevrokop dialect and the Razlog dialect to the west and the Turkish dialects of the Turkish population in the Eastern Rhodopes. To the south, the Smolyan dialect crosses the Greek-Bulgarian border and is spoken by much of the Muslim Bulgarian (Pomak) population in Western Thrace. As a result of the rugged mountainous terrain and the century-long isolation of the region from the rest of the country, the Smolyan dialect is the most idiosyncratic of all Bulgarian dialects (including the Western Central Macedonian dialects) and is not readily understandable even for its immediate neighbours.

Leslie Wright (cricketer)

Leslie Wright (20 January 1903 – 6 January 1956) was an English cricketer who played 193 first-class matches between 1925 and 1933, every one of them for Worcestershire. He was primarily an opening batsman, although he did pick up some useful (if expensive) wickets with his medium-pacers.
Wright played as a professional for Stourbridge Cricket Club before beginning his county career.
His first-class debut came in May 1925, when he scored 31 and 14 against Oxford University at The Parks.
He did not play again that season, but in 1926 he appeared on 26 occasions, and ended the summer with 873 first-class runs at an average of 18.97.
This tally included his maiden hundred, 111 against Hampshire (sharing an opening partnership of 185 with Maurice Jewell) in midsummer.
He also picked up the first of his 76 wickets when he removed Leicestershire's Les Berry and Alec Skelding in early June.
From then until the end of his career in 1933, Wright was a regular sight in the Worcestershire team: in only two seasons (1931 and 1933) did he make fewer than 20 appearances. His most productive season was 1928, when he made 1,402 runs at 24.07, including 101 and 57 against Hampshire.
He also passed his thousand runs in 1930, when he hit 1,180: this was the only year in which he made two centuries, of which the higher (his career best) was 134 against Northamptonshire in July.
He narrowly missed out on the landmark in 1929, making 992 runs that year.
After 1930 Wright never scored another hundred, and although his form recovered somewhat after a dreadful 1931 in which he averaged less than 10,
in 92 innings in the last three years of his career the highest score was the 86 he struck against the touring Indians at Worcester in June 1932.
He did hit another six half-centuries that summer, and a further three in his final season of 1933. His last game, against Glamorgan in late August 1933, was an anticlimax: Wright was bowled by George Lavis for 3 in his only innings, and went wicketless from ten overs.
Wright also played football as a centre-forward in the Worcester League. After retiring from cricket, he ran a remand home in Mitcham, Surrey.

I Like It Like That (The Miracles song)

"Note: This article is about the song. For The Miracles' deleted 1964 album of the same name, see "I Like It Like That (album)". For other uses, see I Like It Like That (disambiguation)"
I Like It Like That was a 1964 hit song by Motown 
group The Miracles on its Tamla label subsidiary. It reached the Top 30 of the "Billboard" Pop chart, charting at #27 and the Top 10 of Cash Box R&B chart, peaking at #10.(Billboard Magazine's R&B chart was temporarily suspended during this time). This is not the Chris Kenner hit song of the same name, but rather, a Miracles original, written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson and Marv Tarplin, and is included on the group's first greatest hits album, "Greatest Hits from the Beginning". It was also the title song from their long-since deleted 1964 album of the same name. 
Like many Miracles hit songs, "I Like It Like That" begins with Tarplin's guitar. It features a "live party" feel, similar to their earlier 1963 hit, "Mickey's Monkey". Smokey encourages everybody to ""clap your hands now, everybody, we're gonna have some fun tonight...we're gonna sing and shout...knock ourselves out...and everything's gonna be alright"". The other Miracles, Bobby, Ronnie, Pete, and Claudette, join in with their trademark harmony vocals, with chants of "alright", and "I like it like that" as The Funk Brothers add additional instruments to the mix. 
"I Like It Like That" was released during a period (1964) when Smokey and the Miracles were so busy touring as the headline act with the famed Motortown Revue shows, and writing big hits for other Motown acts, principally Mary Wells and The Temptations, that their own chart action suffered. Of the group's four single releases that year (the others were "Come On Do The Jerk", "(You Can't Let the Boy Overpower) The Man in You", and "That's What Love Is Made Of"), "I Like It Like That" was the only one to crack the Billboard Pop Top 30, while two songs that they wrote for the two aforementioned acts, "My Guy" and "My Girl" respectively, both reached #1 Pop. ("My Girl" was originally intended to be recorded by The Miracles, had they released it instead, it would have given them a badly needed big hit that year). Fortunately the following year, 1965, would prove to be The Miracles' biggest year ever. "I Like It Like That" has inspired cover versions by Bobby Vee and Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels. The song's B side, "You're So Fine And Sweet", featured a rare lead by Miracles second tenor Bobby Rogers (who had sung co-lead vocals with Smokey on the group's smash single "You've Really Got A Hold On Me" the previous year), and inspired a cover version by The Undertakers.

Junior City Council

A Junior City Council is a local form of government, governed by minors. Junior City Councils hold the same jurisdiction as the sponsoring city council.
United States.
The first Junior City Council in the United States was the Strasburg Junior City Council, founded in November 2006. The Junior City Council is composed of youth public officials elected into office. The purpose of the Junior City Council is its unique opportunity to give young adults experience in government and politics. The Council functions as a normal City Council with meetings, agendas, minutes, and takes on public projects. The Junior Council is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit, and is copyrighted.
Zimbabwe.
In the early 1950 the idea of a Junior City Council was conceived to run parallel with the Senior Council. It was molded into a non-political and non-profit making organization whose aims as laid out in its operating constitution were to; provide a means by which senior scholars may obtain knowledge of civic affairs, report to senior scholars information pertinent to City Council affairs, create an organization representative of all the senior schools within the area of the jurisdiction of the Senior City Council, create a liaison between the young people of the City and the City Council, provide the young people of the City with a means by which they may make known their opinions and feelings, and by the example set by the Junior Council encourage a desire among the younger citizens of the City to participate actively in the affairs of the City. It is a make-up of senior scholars doing their A-level studies.
The Junior City Council is headed by an executive committee which comprises the Junior Mayor, Junior Deputy Mayor, Junior Town Clerk, Junior Treasurer, Junior Public Relations officer, Junior Projects coordinator, Junior Chief of Committees Clerk. The number of the Junior councilors equals the number of the Senior Councilors or alternatively the number of wards that need individual council representation. A ward being the subdivided units of the City that a Councilor is given mandate to represent. The Junior Council activities are closely monitored and regulated by a body of former excelled Junior Councilors who are awarded the title City Junior Alderman. The Junior Council term runs for a year and that of Junior Alderman is for life.The council is more relevant compared to the junior parliament.
South Africa.
South Africa also has Junior City Councils in each city. The Junior City Councils are non-profit organizations that serves the youth and community of their area. They organize a number of events to provide opportunities for the youth to interact, to take initiative and responsibility and simultaneously raise funds for charity. The council members represent the willing schools in that allocated area/city. The learners plan and do all the fundraising events by themselves. The Junior City Councils are led by a student elected Executive or Management committee and are overseen by a governing body of adult members.

The Johannesburg Junior Council (JJC) is presently composed of 72 junior councilors all of whom are Grade 11 students, nominated by 36 secondary schools in the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan area. There are no criteria for a school to join the JJC; the only requirement is the desire to participate. The JJC was established in Johannesburg in 1928 making it one of the first junior councils in Southern Africa. It was formally associated with the Johannesburg City Council. It is now a registered NGO (052/457/NPO), completely self-sufficient and run by the youth of Johannesburg.
The JJC is composed of a Governing Body, an Executive Committee, Chairpersons of six committees and their committee members.
The Executive consists of a Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Speaker of House, Chief Whip, Secretary and Public Relations Officer. The six committees - Youth Awareness, Welfare, Sports and Recreation, Arts and Culture, Ecology and Contact - are each managed by a Chairperson and a Deputy Chairperson and are governed by a constitution.

Among many things the JJC is committed to developing future leaders and upstanding citizens of this country, whilst at the same time giving back to the community.
Each year, it is up to the councilors to determine what events shall be organised to benefit the underprivileged. Coming up with events, fundraising for the events and all the organisation and planning of these events is part of the leadership development program in place on JJC.

The Junior City Council of Pretoria was founded in 1979 in the “Year of the Child”. It is a non-profit organization which serves the youth and the community of Pretoria. The council organizes several events to provide opportunities for the youth to interact and to take initiative and responsibility, while raising funds for charity. 
The diversity of the projects successfully organized by the council is of great importance. All projects are planned and executed by the council members themselves.
An Advisory Committee, consisting of educators from the member schools, periodically advise the council. The Patron of the council has the authority to veto undesirable projects according to her discretion. The patron of the JCC is Mrs. Linda Oberholzer as in 2012.
The Junior City Council of Pretoria currently (2012) has 38 member schools. Each school has two representatives: one grade 10 and one grade 11 student, thereby a total of 76 council members.

The term of office for all councilors is two years and it ends in April of their final school year. (Grade 12)
The Junior City Council of Pretoria consists of 7 committees, with each committee meeting different needs.
Each committee consists of a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, a Secretary and committee members.

The Corporate Center

The Corporate Center, formerly known as the Union Carbide Corporate Center, is an architecturally unique building in Danbury, Connecticut. Constructed in 1982 as the headquarters of the Union Carbide chemical company, it is known for its unusual style and floorplan layout. It has been recently renamed "The Matrix Corporate Center".
__TOC__
History.
In 1976, Union Carbide announced that it intended to relocate from New York City to a location in Connecticut. After beginning construction in 1980, Union Carbide moved its approximately 3,000 staff members to the facility in 1983.
Following several corporate realignments, space was rented out to several different companies after a 1986 leaseback arrangement transferred ownership to a Florida concern. This resulted in the facility being renamed the Corporate Center in 1992. Following the purchase of Union Carbide by The Dow Chemical Company in 2001, the Union Carbide staff was further reduced and more space sublet to other companies. In 2007 the building was sold to Grubb & Ellis for $80 million, less than half its original construction cost of $190 million. In 2009, the building was resold to Matrix Reality Group for approximately 80 Million dollars. The new owner of the building is doing many renovations, such as new granite in the Main Reception area and in other parts of the building.
Architecture.
The layout of the building is unique in that the entire building rests on 5,000 pillars driven into the ground at heights of , to avoid having to clear the land of obstacles. Additionally, the outer walls of the building face into the forest while the interior walls face a completely enclosed 2,500-space parking garage. The building was designed with several pods for the then divisions of Union Carbide that would occupy the facility. Further, it was set up so that each office was very close, sometimes only 10 feet (3 m), from its related parking spot and that employees would not need to exit the building to perform any functions.
In the center of the complex are several conference rooms, libraries, a cafeteria, and other support services. Each room in the 2.1 million-square-foot (195,000 m²) complex, 1.3 million (117,000 m²) of which is office space, has separate temperature controls and natural light through a series of translucent windows. The building sits on a campus which has been subdivided over the years and now also hosts jogging trails and condominiums.

CMDA has a large campus ministry throughout the U.S. A team of 50 regional staff members organize campus Bible studies, mission teams, leadership training and outreach functions on 326 medical, dental, osteopathic, podiatry and allied health schools. For a formal list of these campus organizations go to Campus & Community Ministries
Missionary Focus.
CMDA has a large missionary focus. The Center for Medical Missions (CMM) provides pre-field training, on-site consultations, networking, ministry resources, monthly (the e-Pistle) and semi-monthly (Your Call) publications and scholarships for international rotations. CMM currently serves over 760 students and residents through their "Your Call" program, which is designed to help those with a call to medical missions stay focused on that call throughout their years of preparation.
Medical Education International (MEI) builds relationships with physicians, dentists and students in other countries through medical education and training. MEI teams respond to requests of local medical leaders and/or Christian workers to teach topics that will improve local health care, often in some of the least known and remote parts of the world.
CMDA's Global Health Outreach (GHO) provides opportunities for medical, dental and other healthcare professionals to treat the physical and spiritual needs of afflicted/impoverished peoples. This is often done in the context of short-term medical and dental missionary service. CMDA believes this to be an important aspect of their organization in accordance with the biblical teachings of the book of Matthew (22:39; 25:36; 28:19). CMDA's GHO also partners with local pastors, missionaries, and various local organizations in an effort to ensure an on-going local ministry persists following the departure of a short-term medical/dental missionary team.
Nationally, CMDA partners with organizations such as Med Send and Global Missions Health Conference to help enable and equip doctors for medical missions.
Public Policy.
The Christian Medical Association's Washington office provides a national voice for members on public policy issues such as health care, conscience rights, human trafficking, international health, abortion, HIV-AIDS, human cloning, abstinence, stem cell research, assisted suicide and more. 
The Washington Office links our members with Congress, the White House, federal agencies and policy organizations; provides congressional testimony; presents life-honoring perspectives through the national media; and publishes resources on vital issues. 
The Washington office also directs the Freedom2Care (www.Freedom2Care.org) coalition of over 50 organizations to advance conscience rights in health care.

THV Galatea

THV "Galatea" is a lighthouse tender operated by Trinity House, the body responsible for the operation of lighthouses and marine navigation aids around the coasts of England, Wales and the Channel Islands.
History.
THV "Galatea" was launched in July 2006, replacing the THV "Mermaid", in service with Trinity House since 1987. "Mermaid" was sold to the Gardline group of Great Yarmouth, for conversion to survey vessel. "Galatea" is a sister vessel to the NLV "Pharos". The Queen and Prince Philip visited the Pool of London on 17 October 2007 for the naming of THV "Galatea", moored alongside .
This is the second Trinity House vessel named "Galatea". The first, a paddle yacht built in 1868, served Trinity House until 1895. She was named in honour of which had recently completed a round-the-world voyage under the command of Queen Victoria's second son, Captain HRH The Duke of Edinburgh, who was Master of Trinity House at the time. "Galatea" attended the commissioning of Eddystone, Wolf and other lighthouses designed by Sir James Douglass. THV "Galatea" featured in the 2008 BBC Documentary Comedy, "Three Men in a Boat", where Dara Ó Briain, Rory McGrath and Griff Rhys Jones used the vessel to get to the Scilly isles.
In Greek mythology, Galatea was a sea nymph who attended Poseidon (the god of the sea). She loved Acis, the shepherd son of Pan. However, Acis was killed by the jealous Cyclops Polyphemus and, with her heart broken, Galatea turned into a stream of water.
Service.
THV "Galatea" provides aids to navigation for the safe passage of mariners, including maintenance work, buoy deployment, wreck location marking and towing. She is also able to carry out additional tasks such as hydrographic surveying and wreck finding and contract commercial work. She is equipped for:

XBLite

XBLite is a free Open Source BASIC programming language compiler and development system. It was started in 2001 by David Szafranski in order to provide a Windows exclusive version of the XBasic dialect. XBLite is released under the GNU GPL licensing scheme, Standard libraries are released under the GNU LGPL licensing scheme.
The XBLite syntax is very similar to that of XBasic and somewhat similar to Microsoft's QuickBASIC in that it is a procedural language capable of subs and functions. XBLite also has 64 bit integer data type, User Defined Types and the ability to have multiple modules in order to create GUI applications or games.
XBLite History.
XBLite is a project that was started back in 2001. The main idea was to create a language that was based on the XBasic project that was to be exclusively a Microsoft Windows only programming language and environment. The first official release (version 1.0.0) was announced on October 2002, and subsequent versions were spread out amongst the last 6 years of development. Each release boasted both bug fixes and new features (to either the language itself and/or the different tools that are available with the XBLite project).
Today, version 2.4.0 is the current release of the compiler and version 1.30 of XSEd (The code editor). One of the latest projects is a visual GUI designer called viXen.
Components.
XBLite comes with a complete set of components.
Sample Code.

Geoffrey Rose (epidemiologist)

Geoffrey Rose was an eminent epidemiologist whose ideas have been credited with transforming the approach to strategies for improving health. He was formerly the Emeritus Professor of Epidemiology at the Department of Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Early life and career.
Geoffrey Rose was born on 19 April 1926. In 1958 he joined the epidemiology department of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ("LSHTM")and became a 'part-time' Reader in 1964. In 1970 he became the 'Visiting Professor of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine' and was elected to Full Professor of Epidemiology in 1977. In his time at the LSHTM he worked with many pioneering epidemiologists, including Donald Reid. He was also responsible for starting the Masters in Epidemiology course. He died November 12, 1993.
Influence.
Of his numerous publications, there are two that stand out in terms of their influence on the discipline of epidemiology, the seminal 1985 article ""Sick Individuals and Sick Populations"" and his 1992 book ""The Strategy of Preventive Medicine"". The impact goes beyond the field of epidemiology and into that of public health generally. One publication claimed that "A casual Social Sciences Citation Index search yielded over 700 citations of this work". As S Schwartz and AV Diez-Roux pointed out, the central lesson that has been integrated into the aforementioned fields is that ""a large number of people at a small risk may give rise to more cases of disease than the small number who are at high risk"". It was their assertion that this insight of Rose has profound implications for intervention and prevention strategies, and has been incorporated into research contexts through an understanding of the difference between measures of absolute and relative risk.
Miquel Porta and others have emphasized that Rose is among the physicians and epidemiologists who best conveyed the notion that "as citizens and societies we have shared, common responsibilities in front of threats to health is central to epidemiology, public health, even to clinical medicine".
Rose clearly showed that a preventive measure that brings large benefits to the community may offer little to each participating person. For example, to prevent one death due to a motor vehicle accident, many hundreds of people must wear seat belts. Conversely, an intervention which brings much benefit to an individual may have a small impact in the population. These phenomena are sometimes called "prevention paradoxes".
‘High-risk strategy'.
According to Rose, the ‘high-risk strategy' to prevention is a clinically oriented approach to preventive medicine which focuses its efforts on needy individuals with the highest levels of the risk factor (‘the deviant minority with high-risk status’), and utilizes the established framework of medical services. In other words, the ‘high-risk strategy' is ‘a targeted rescue operation for vulnerable individuals’. The aim is to help each person reduce the high level of exposure to a cause or to some intermediate variable. Main strengths of this strategy include: the intervention may be matched to the needs of the individual; it may avoid interference with those who are not at a special risk; it may be accommodated within the ethical and cultural values, organization, and economics, of the health care system; selectivity may increase the likelihood of a cost-effective use of resources. Main weaknesses of the high-risk strategy are: prevention may become medicalized; success may be palliative and temporary; the contribution to overall (population) control of a disease may be small; the preventive intervention may be behaviorally or culturally inadequate or unsustainable; it has a poor ability to predict which individuals will benefit from the intervention.
‘Population strategy’.
This is a public health-oriented approach to preventive medicine and public health which predicts that shifting the population distribution of a risk factor prevents more BURDEN OF DISEASE than targeting people at high risk. Rose introduced this principal to accommodate for members of the community who were at of low risk. It starts with the recognition that the occurrence of common exposures and diseases reflects the functioning of society as a whole. The approach is more relevant to decrease exposure to (a) certain environmental agents that individuals have little capacity to detect than to (b) risk factors that individuals may generally decide to avoid. Main strengths of this strategy include: it may be radical (“only the social and political approach confronts the root causes”); the societal effects of a distributional shift may be large; it may be more culturally appropriate and sustainable to seek a general change in behavioral norms and in the social values that facilitate their adoption than to attempt to individually change behaviors that are socially conditioned. Main limitations of the population strategy are: it offers only a small benefit to each participating individual, which may be wiped out by a small risk; it requires major changes in the economics and mode of functioning of society, which often makes changes unlikely. Individuals generally prefer to pay as late as possible, and to enjoy the benefits as soon as possible. Social benefits –which are often achieved through processes with the opposite timing of costs and benefits– may thus be scarcely attractive to the individual. Nevertheless, shared values and targets do exist at the community level.
It was reasserted by Doyle, Furey and Flowers, writing in 2005, that the central messages expounded by Rose remain highly relevant to modern public health policy and practice.

Wildfire (Michael Martin Murphey song)

"Wildfire" is a song written by Michael Martin Murphey and Larry Cansler. It was originally recorded by Murphey, who had yet to add his middle name to his recorded work, and appears on his 1975 album "Blue Sky – Night Thunder".
Released in February 1975 as the album's lead single, "Wildfire" became Murphey's highest-charting pop hit in the United States. The song spent two weeks at number 3 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in June 1975; in addition, it reached the top of the "Billboard" adult contemporary chart, where it remained for one week.
Background.
Murphey and Cansler co-wrote "Wildfire" in 1968, shortly after Murphey emerged as a solo artist. Earlier in the decade he had been part of a duo known as the Lewis & Clark Expedition (which had appeared and performed in an episode of "I Dream of Jeannie") in 1968 with his fellow singer-songwriter Boomer Castleman. When Murphey rerecorded "Wildfire" for a new album in 1997, he was quoted by "Billboard" as saying that what many consider his signature song "broke my career wide open and, on some level, still keeps it fresh. Because that song appeals to kids, and always has, it's kept my career fresh."
In a 2008 interview, Murphey talked about the origins of the song and the context in which in was written.
Content.
The lyrics are the ruminations of a homesteader who has become much disillusioned with farming and obsessed with the ghost of a young woman said to have died searching for her pony, "Wildfire", during a blizzard. The homesteader hopes to catch up with the ghost mounted on her pony, and with them to escape from farming, which he bitterly calls "sodbusting".
In popular culture.
In 2007, the host of "The Late Show", David Letterman, developed a sudden fascination with "Wildfire", discussing the song and its lyrics—particularly the line about "leave sodbustin' behind"—with the bandleader Paul Shaffer over the course of several weeks. This ultimately led to Murphey's being invited on the show to perform "Wildfire". Letterman described the song as "haunting and disturbingly mysterious, but always lovely," and surmised that the performance would leave the studio audience with "a palpable sense of ... mysticism, melancholy ... and uplifting well-being."
In a third season episode of "The Simpsons" named "Lisa's Pony", Lisa played the song for her pony with her saxophone. She introduced the song by saying "This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It's called 'Wildfire' "
The song has occasionally appeared in "bad song" surveys, such as one by the humor columnist Dave Barry during the 1990s. He quoted one reader who, referring to the song's tale of the loss of a woman and a pony in a "killing frost", pointed out that "'killing' in 'killing frost' refers to your flowers and your garden vegetables, and when one is forecast you should cover your tomatoes ... Nobody ever got lost in a killing frost who wouldn't get lost in July as well." But it could also be pointed out that the song is written from the perspective of a farmer, in which a killing frost would be a memorable event. The song goes on to say "in a blizzard she was lost," so obviously the killing frost continued on to be a significant winter storm.

Long Beach Township Beach Patrol

The Long Beach Township Beach Patrol (LBTBP) was founded in 1936 to meet the growing demand for an ocean rescue force in the growing ocean community known as Long Beach Island, specifically Long Beach Township, New Jersey, United States. The organization employs over 200 full and part-time staff including lifeguards, office/headquarters staff and other positions relevant to its services. The Long Beach Township Beach Patrol guards of ocean beaches and two bay beaches and is one of the largest beach patrols in the United States.
Organization.
The of protected area (including bay beaches) are overseen by the beach patrol chief and are further divided into patrols. Each patrol has its own captain, lieutenant, and acting lieutenant. Beaches guarded by LBTBP from north to south are: Loveladies, North Beach, Brant Beach, Beach Haven Crest, Spray Beach, and Holgate.
Competitions.
Each of the patrols compete in annual in-house competitions. These competitions encourage lifeguards to maintain their fitness and test skills like rowing, paddling, swimming and running. Towards the end of each summer there is a two day competition known as Mayor's Cup. All of the patrols compete to win this event, however North Beach and Loveladies are combined due to their small size.
Programs.
LBTBP has multiple programs:
IRB Program.
The IRB (Inflatable Rescue Boat) program consists of LBTBP lifeguards who have been chosen to participate in it. The IRBs are used to patrol along the shore line (just outside the swimming area) to provide backup for rescues, setup for competitions and assist with un-cooperative boaters and personal water craft users.
SCUBA Search and Rescue.
Lifeguards who display excellent work ethic can apply to be part of the SCUBA search and rescue team, which provides search and rescue services for LBTBP when dealing with submerged victims. The team also assists in helping setup race and competition courses.
LIT Program.
The LIT (Lifeguard In Training) program gives children ages 11–15 the chance to learn the rescue techniques used by LBTBP in order to greatly improve their chance of being hired at the age of 16. LIT's will learn rescue techniques, procedures and radio codes, CPR and First Aid, and more.
Beachwheels program.
The Beachwheels program was created in 1992 to allow mentally and physically handicapped children and adults the opportunity to experience the beach.

Princess Marianne of the Netherlands

Princess Marianne of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau ("Wilhelmina Frederika Louise Charlotte Marianne"; 9 May 1810 – 29 May 1883), was a member of the House of Orange-Nassau, by birth Princess of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands and by marriage Princess of the Kingdom of Prussia.
Family.
Born in Berlin, she was the youngest child and second daughter of King William I of the Netherlands by his wife Wilhelmine of Prussia. Her elder sister, Pauline, had died in 1806, long before her birth, so Marianne became the only daughter of her parents to survive adulthood. Her two older brothers were the future King William II and Prince Frederik of the Netherlands. Two other brothers were stillborn.
Life.
In The Hague on 14 September 1830, Marianne married her first cousin Prince Albert, the fourth son of her mother's brother, King Frederick William III of Prussia. The union produced five children:
In 1845 she left her unfaithful husband and began to live with her lover and former coachman . On 28 March 1849, Marianne and Albert of Prussia were formally divorced. Seven months later (30 October) in Cefalù, Sicily, she gave birth to her only child with van Rossum, a son, called . After this, the courts of The Hague and Berlin broke all contact with her. Marianne, Johannes and their son spent the following years in Italy and from 1853 at Weißwasser Castle near Jauernig.
In 1855 Marianne bought in Erbach, Rheingau. An unusually progressive woman and cultural visionary, she made the Schloss Reinhartshausen a cultural center of the Rhine. Marianne reconstructed part of the Schloss as a museum to house her collection of 600 paintings. The museum is known today as the "Festsäle". The Schloss was always vibrant with many guests and Marianne encouraged young artists providing them accommodation. Of her treasures, 180 paintings, 110 drawings including watercolors and gouaches, as well as various sculptures can be found there today.
On Christmas Day of 1861, her son Johannes Wilhelm died of pneumonia in Reinhartshausen at age twelve. To honor him, Marianne donated 60.000 "Gulden" to the Erbacher locals for a piece of land on which a church was to be constructed. The church was completed and Johannes buried under its altar. The church, named after Johannes, is today’s Protestant church in Erbach.
Twelve years later, on 10 May 1873, Johannes van Rossum, Marianne's partner for almost thirty years and the love of her life, died aged sixty-four. He was buried next to his son.
Marianne survived him by ten years and died in the Schloss Reinhartshausen in Erbach twenty days after her seventy-third birthday. She was buried near Johannes van Rossum and their son.
Her eldest son, Prince Albert of Prussia, inherited her estate, included the Schloss Reinhartshausen. In 1940, her grandson, Prince Frederick Heinrich of Prussia -Albert's son- owned the property. Today the Schloss Reinhartshausen is a 5-stars hotel.

Jean Robert Roy (12 November 1923 - 28 December 1996) was a Liberal party member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was born in Timmins, Ontario and became a businessman, contractor and quantity surveyor by career.
Roy, a Franco-Ontarian, studied at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario before working in accounting, then in the construction industry.
He was first elected at the Timmins riding in the 1968 general election. Roy was re-elected there in the 1972 and 1974 federal elections, and after completing his term in the 30th Parliament he left federal politics due to reported health concerns.
During a House of Commons session during the 1970 October Crisis, Roy excoriated NDP members who opposed the proclamation of the War Measures Act in response to terrorist actions in Quebec. NDP member Harold Winch demanded that Roy retract an accusation that Winch's party's vote against the Act was tantamount to "support for the murderers".
Roy also opposed increases in Canadian content on television as his riding's only available television broadcasts at that time were from CBC Television and felt a reduction in the minimal American programming provided would be a "disservice".
After he left federal politics, he was President of the Standards Council of Canada and served on the International Joint Commission regarding the Great Lakes.
Roy died suddenly at his home in Timmins on 28 December 1996, leaving a daughter, a son and his wife Georgette Clément (m. 1947).

Gottex

Gottex is a luxury, designer swimwear manufacturer based in Tel Aviv. The brand has been described as "swimwear haute couture". 
History.
Gottex was founded in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 1957 by Lea Gottlieb, who headed the design team until 1998. She adapted her expertise as a raincoat manufacturer to create a pioneering swimsuit company. 
She sold her wedding ring for capital, bought fabric, borrowed a sewing machine and began to design swimsuits that were unique to Israel, inspired by the local Middle-Eastern light and colors: "the aqua of the Mediterranean, the golden yellow of the desert, the blue of Lake Tiberias, the pink of Jerusalem stone and the greens of the Galilee."
During the German occupation of Hungary, Gottlieb was forced to move with her husband and daughters from one hiding place to another. To avoid being recognized as a Jew when passing through checkpoints, she used to tuck her head in a bouquet of flowers. She said that the flower motifs in her designs were a tribute to the flowers that saved her life.
In Gottlieb's vision, Gottex collections can be worn "from pool to the bar," and then to a restaurant or cocktail parties. In addition to swimsuits, Gottex produces caftans, tunics and trousers, combining swimwear and beachwear. Gottex is a pioneer of swimsuits with hard-cup bras. Gottex is known for using innovative fabrics. It was the first manufacturer to introduce Spandex. 
In 1975, she was contacted by the fashion houses of Yves St. Laurent and Pierre Cardin, which sought to manufacture her swimsuits under their names. Instead, she expanded into men’s and children’s swimwear, bed linens, towels and drapes.
By the 1980s, Gottex swimsuits were being worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, Spain's Queen Sofia, Elizabeth Taylor and Brooke Shields.
In 1997, Gottex was acquired by the Lev Leviev of the Africa-Israel Group.
Gottex is America's top swimsuit import. According to the Israel Export Institute, exports of Israeli swimwear totaled $44 million in 1999.

List of posthumous Academy Award winners and nominees

This is a list of posthumous Academy Award winners and nominees. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences annually presents Academy Awards in both competitive and honorary categories. This list includes posthumous winners and nominees of the Academy's competitive awards, as well as posthumous winners of its honorary awards.
This list is current as of the 85th Academy Awards ceremony held on February 24, 2013.
Excluded: retrospective awards.
The list does not include people who were retrospectively honoured with an Academy Award and were dead at the time the Academy made the decision to make the retrospective award. For example: in 1993, seventeen years after his death, Dalton Trumbo was retrospectively awarded the 1953 Oscar for Best Writing - Motion Picture Story for "Roman Holiday". It had been previously awarded to Ian McLellan Hunter. However, Hunter was merely a front for Trumbo, because Trumbo was blacklisted at the time and it was not possible for his name to appear in either the film's credits or the Academy Award nomination (hence, it was not generally known that he was the real screenwriter). Trumbo did not die until 1976, and under normal circumstances he would have received this award in person in 1953; hence the Academy does not consider this a posthumous award but a correction of the record.
Similarly, the Oscar for Best Screenplay (Adaptation) for "The Bridge on the River Kwai" was originally awarded to Pierre Boulle, but only in 1984 corrected to honor the actual screenwriters, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who were on the Hollywood blacklist at the time and could only work on the film in secret. By the time this correction was made, both Foreman and Wilson had died, but the award does not qualify for an entry in the above list.

Big Daddy's House

"Big Daddy's House" is a cooking show on the specialty channel Food Network. The show stars Aaron McCargo, Jr., the winner of the fourth season of the network's reality television series, "The Next Food Network Star". The six-episode first season was McCargo's grand prize for winning the reality show. The first episode aired on Sunday, August 3, 2008 at 1:30 p.m., just one week after the last episode of "The Next Food Network Star".
McCargo left his job as the executive catering chef of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia to work on "Big Daddy's House". The show aimed to show cooks, even those with little culinary experience, that making and preparing quality food can be easy, flavorful and enjoyable. When asked to describe the goal of his show, McCargo said, "Fun...bottom line. This is about having fun with your children, your spouse, your neighbors." McCargo, who adopts a friendly, casual demeanor on the screen, said he sought to make viewers feel confident about their kitchen skills. The Food Network billed "Big Daddy's House" as featuring "simple, fun and mouth-watering recipes that illustrate Aaron's love for big, bold flavors". "CBS News" said of McCargo, "Aaron not only brings his passion for down-to-earth cooking to the kitchen, he brings a warm and inviting personality."
The first season ended in early September. "Big Daddy's House" ranked as the number one "in the kitchen"-style weekend show on the Food Network during its initial six-episode run. An average of 25 percent of the show's viewership were African Americans, which satisfied a hope by the Food Network to raise the overall diversity of the network's viewers. "Big Daddy's House" was renewed for a second season, which premiered on January 4, 2009. The third season began on July 12, 2009.

The field is often referred to as simply "molecular electronics", but this term is also used to refer to the distantly related field of conductive polymers and organic electronics, which uses the properties of molecules to affect the bulk properties of a material. A nomenclature distinction has been suggested so that "molecular materials for electronics" refers to this latter field of bulk applications, while "molecular scale electronics" refers to the nanoscale single-molecule applications discussed here.
Fundamental concepts.
Conventional electronics have traditionally been made from bulk materials. Ever since its invention in 1958 the performance and complexity of integrated circuits has been growing exponentially (a trend also known as Moore’s law) and has forced the feature sizes of the embedded components to shrink accordingly. As the structures become smaller, the sensitivity for deviations increases and in a few generations, when the minimum feature sizes reaches 13 nm, the composition of the devices must be controlled to a precision of a few atoms 
for the devices to work. With the bulk approach having inherent limitations in addition to becoming increasingly demanding and expensive, the idea was born that the components could instead be built up atom for atom in a chemistry lab (bottom up) as opposed to carving them out of bulk material (top down). This idea is the reasoning behind molecular electronics with the ultimate miniaturization being components contained in single molecules.
In single molecule electronics, the bulk material is replaced by single molecules. That is, instead of creating structures by removing or applying material after a pattern scaffold, the atoms are put together in a chemistry lab. This way billions of billions of copies are made simultaneously (typically more than 10 20 molecules are made at once) while the composition of molecules are controlled down to the last atom. The molecules utilized have properties that resemble traditional electronic components such as a wire, transistor or rectifier.
Single molecule electronics is an emerging field, and entire electronic circuits consisting exclusively of molecular sized compounds are still very far from being realized. However, the continuous demand for more computing power together with the inherent limitations of the present day lithographic methods make the transition seem unavoidable. Currently, the focus is on discovering molecules with interesting properties and on finding ways to obtaining reliable and reproducible contacts between the molecular components and the bulk material of the electrodes.
Theoretical basis.
Molecular electronics operates in the quantum realm of distances less than 100 nanometers. The miniaturization down to single molecules brings the scale down to a regime where quantum effects are important. As opposed to the case in conventional electronic components, where electrons can be filled in or drawn out more or less like a continuous flow of charge, the transfer of a single electron alters the system significantly. This means that when an electron has been transferred from the source electrode to the molecule, the molecule gets charged up and makes it much harder for the next one to transfer (see also Coulomb blockade). The significant amount of energy due to charging must be taken into account when making calculations about the electronic properties of the setup and is highly sensitive to distances to conducting surfaces nearby.
The theory of single molecule devices is particularly interesting since the system under consideration is an open quantum system in nonequilibrium (driven by voltage). In the low bias voltage regime, the nonequilibrium nature of the molecular junction can be ignored, and the current-voltage characteristics of the device can be calculated using the equilibrium electronic structure of the system. However, in stronger bias regimes a more sophisticated treatment is required, as there is no longer a variational principle. In the elastic tunneling case (where the passing electron does not exchange energy with the system), the formalism of Rolf Landauer can be used to calculate the transmission through the system as a function of bias voltage, and hence the current. In inelastic tunneling, an elegant formalism based on the non-equilibrium Green's functions of Leo Kadanoff and Gordon Baym, and independently by Leonid Keldysh was put forth by Ned Wingreen and Yigal Meir. This Meir-Wingreen formulation has been used to great success in the molecular electronics community to examine the more difficult and interesting cases where the transient electron exchanges energy with the molecular system (for example through electron-phonon coupling or electronic excitations).
Further, connecting single molecules reliably to a larger scale circuit has proven a great challenge, and constitutes a significant hindrance to commercialization.
Examples.
Common for molecules utilized in molecular electronics is that the structures contain a lot of alternating double and single bonds (see also Conjugated system). The reason for this is that such a pattern delocalizes the molecular orbitals making it possible for electrons to move freely over the conjugated area.
Wires.
The sole purpose of molecular wires is to electrically connect different parts of a molecular electrical circuit. As the assembly of these and their connection to a macroscopic circuit is still not mastered, the focus of research in single molecule electronics is primarily on the functionalized molecules: molecular wires are characterized by containing no functional groups and are hence composed of plain repetitions of a conjugated building block. Among these are the carbon nanotubes that are quite large compared to the other suggestions but have shown very promising electrical properties.
The main problem with the molecular wires is to obtain good electrical contact with the electrodes so that the electrons can move freely in and out of the wire.
Transistors.
Single molecule transistors are fundamentally different than the ones known from bulk electronics. The gate in a conventional (field-effect) transistor determines the conductance between the source and drain electrode by controlling the density of charge carriers between them, whereas the gate in a single molecule transistor controls the feasibility of a single electron to jump on and off the molecule by modifying the energy of the molecular orbitals. One of the effects of this difference is that the single molecule transistor is almost binary: it is either ON or OFF. This opposes its bulk counterparts, which have quadratic responses to gate voltage.
It is the quantization of charge into electrons that is responsible for the markedly different behavior compared to bulk electronics. Because of the size of a single molecule, the charging due to a single electron is significant and provides a mean to turn the transistor ON or OFF (see Coulomb blockade). For this to work, the electronic orbitals on the transistor molecule cannot be too well integrated with the orbitals on the electrodes. If they are, an electron cannot be said to be located on the molecule or the electrodes and the molecule will function as a wire.
A popular group of molecules, that can work as the semiconducting channel material in a molecular transistor, is the oligopolyphenylenevinylenes (OPVs) that works by the Coulomb blockade mechanism when placed between the source and drain electrode in an appropriate way. Fullerenes work by the same mechanism and have also been commonly utilized.
Semiconducting carbon nanotubes have also been demonstrated to work as channel material but although molecular, these molecules are sufficiently large to behave almost as bulk semiconductors.
The size of the molecules and the low temperature the measurements are being conducted at makes the quantum mechanical states well defined. It is therefore being researched if the quantum mechanical properties can be used for more advanced purposes than simple transistors (e.g. spintronics).
Physicists at the University of Arizona, in collaboration with chemists from the University of Madrid, have designed a single molecule transistor using a ring-shaped molecule similar to benzene. Physicists at Canada's National Institute for Nanotechnology have designed a single-molecule transistor using styrene.
Both groups expect (their designs have yet to be experimentally verified) their respective devices to function at room temperature, and to be controlled by a single electron.
Rectifiers (diodes).
Molecular rectifiers are mimics of their bulk counterparts and have an asymmetric construction so that the molecule can accept electrons in one end but not the other. The molecules have an electron donor (D) in one end and an electron acceptor (A) in the other. This way, the unstable state D+ – A- will be more readily made than D- – A+. The result is that an electric current can be drawn through the molecule if the electrons are added through the acceptor end, but not so easily if the reverse is attempted. An example of a molecular rectifier was made by Geoffrey J. Ashwell's Ph.D. students.
Techniques.
One of the biggest problems with measuring on single molecules is to establish reproducible electrical contact with only one molecule and doing so without shortcutting the electrodes. Because the current photolithographic technology is unable to produce electrode gaps small enough to contact both ends of the molecules tested (in the order of nanometers) alternative strategies are put into use.
Molecular gaps.
One way to produce electrodes with a molecular sized gap between them is break junctions, in which a thin electrode is stretched until it breaks. Another is electromigration. Here a current is led through a thin wire until it melts and the atoms migrate to produce the gap. Further, the reach of conventional photolithography can be enhanced by chemically etching or depositing metal on the electrodes.
Probably the easiest way to conduct measurements on several molecules is to use the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to contact molecules adhered at the other end to a metal substrate.
Anchoring.
A popular way to anchor molecules to the electrodes is to make use of sulfur's high affinity to gold. In these setups, the molecules are synthesized so that sulfur atoms are placed strategically to function as crocodile clips connecting the molecules to the gold electrodes. Though useful, the anchoring is non-specific and thus anchors the molecules randomly to all gold surfaces. Further, the contact resistance is highly dependent on the precise atomic geometry around the site of anchoring and thereby inherently compromises the reproducibility of the connection.
To circumvent the latter issue, experiments has shown that fullerenes could be a good candidate for use instead of sulfur because of the large conjugated π-system that can electrically contact many more atoms at once than a single atom of sulfur.
Fullerene nanoelectronics.
In polymers, classical organic molecules are composed of both carbon and hydrogen (and sometimes additional compounds such as nitrogen, chlorine or sulphur). They are obtained from petrol and can often be synthesized in large amounts. Most of these molecules are insulating when their length exceeds a few nanometers. However, naturally occurring carbon is conducting. In particular, graphite (recovered from coal or encountered naturally) is conducting. From a theoretical point of view, graphite is a semi-metal, a category in between metals and semi-conductors. It has a layered structure, each sheet being one atom thick. Between each sheet, the interactions are weak enough to allow an easy manual cleavage.
Tailoring the graphite sheet to obtain well defined nanometer-sized objects remains a challenge. However, by the close of the twentieth century, chemists were exploring methods to fabricate extremely small graphitic objects that could be considered single molecules. After studying the interstellar conditions under which carbon is known to form clusters, Richard Smalley's group (Rice University, Texas) set up an experiment in which graphite was vaporized using laser irradiation. Mass spectrometry revealed that clusters containing specific "magic numbers" of atoms were stable, in particular those clusters of 60 atoms. Harry Kroto, an English chemist who assisted in the experiment, suggested a possible geometry for these clusters – atoms covalently bound with the exact symmetry of a soccer ball. Coined buckminsterfullerenes, buckyballs or C60, the clusters retained some properties of graphite, such as conductivity. These objects were rapidly envisioned as possible building blocks for molecular electronics.
Problems.
Artifacts.
When trying to measure electronic characteristics of molecules, artificial phenomena can occur that can be hard to distinguish from truly molecular behavior. Before they were discovered these artifacts have mistakenly been published as being features pertaining to the molecules in question.
Applying a voltage drop in the order of volts across a nanometer sized junction results in a very strong electrical field. The field can cause metal atoms to migrate and eventually close the gap by a thin filament, which can be broken again when carrying a current. The two levels of conductance imitate molecular switching between a conductive and an isolating state of a molecule.
Another encountered artifact is when the electrodes undergo chemical reactions due to the high field strength in the gap. When the bias is reversed the reaction will cause hysteresis in the measurements that can be interpreted as being of molecular origin.
A metallic grain between the electrodes can act as a single electron transistor by the mechanism described above thus resembling the characteristics of a molecular transistor. This artifact is especially common with nanogaps produced by the electromigration technique.
Commercialization.
One of the biggest hindrances for single molecule electronics to be commercially exploited is the lack of techniques to connect a molecular sized circuit to bulk electrodes in a way that gives reproducible results. At the current state, the difficulty of connecting single molecules vastly outweighs any possible performance increase that could be gained from such shrinkage. The picture becomes even worse if the molecules are to have a certain spatial orientation and/or have multiple poles to connect.
Also problematic is the fact that some measurements on single molecules are carried out in cryogenic temperatures (close to absolute zero), which is very energy consuming. This is done to reduce signal noise enough to measure the faint currents of single molecules.
History and recent progress.
In their 1940's discussion of so-called "donor-acceptor" complexes, Robert Mulliken and Albert Szent-Gyorgi advanced the concept of charge transfer in molecules. They subsequently further refined the study of both charge transfer and energy transfer in molecules. Likewise, a 1974 paper from Mark Ratner and Ari Aviram 1 illustrated a theoretical molecular rectifier. In 1988, Aviram described in detail a theoretical single-molecule field-effect transistor. Further concepts were proposed by Forrest Carter of the Naval Research Laboratory, including single-molecule logic gates. A wide range of ideas were presented, under his aegis, at a conference entitled "Molecular Electronic Devices" in 1988. These were all theoretical constructs and not concrete devices. The "direct" measurement of the electronic characteristics of individual molecules awaited the development of methods for making molecular-scale electrical contacts. This was no easy task. Thus, the first experiment directly-measuring the conductance of a single molecule was only reported in 1995 on a single C60 molecule by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewsky in their seminal Physical Revie Letter paper and later in 1997 by Mark Reed and co-workers on a few hundred molecules. Since then, this branch of the field has progressed rapidly. Likewise, as it has become possible to measure such properties directly, the theoretical predictions of the early workers have been substantially confirmed.
Recent progress in nanotechnology and nanoscience has facilitated both experimental and theoretical study of molecular electronics. In particular, the development of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and later the atomic force microscope (AFM) have facilitated manipulation of single-molecule electronics. In addition, theoretical advances in molecular electronics have facilitated further understanding of non-adibatic charge transfer events at electrode-electrolyte interfaces.
The concept of molecular electronics was first published in 1974 when Aviram and Ratner suggested an organic molecule that could work as a rectifier. Having both huge commercial and fundamental interest much effort was put into proving its feasibility and 16 years later in 1990 the first demonstration of an intrinsic molecular rectifier was realized by Ashwell and coworkers for a thin film of molecules.
The first measurement of the conductance of a single molecule was realised in 1994 by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewski and published in 1995 (see the corresponding Phys. Rev. Lett. paper). This was the conclusion of 10 years of research started at IBM TJ Watson, using the scanning tunnelling microscope tip apex to switch a single molecule as already explored by A. Aviram, C. Joachim and M. Pomerantz at the end of the 80's (see their seminal Chem. Phys. Lett. paper during this period). The trick was to use an UHV Scanning Tunneling microscope to allow the tip apex to gently touch the top of a single molecule adsorbed on an Au(110) surface. A resistance of 55 MOhms was recorded together with a low voltage linear I-V. The contact was certified by recording the I-z current distance characteristic, which allows the measurement of the deformation of the cage under contact. This first experiment was followed by the reported result using a mechanical break junction approach to connect two gold electrodes to a sulfur-terminated molecular wire by Mark Reed and James Tour in 1997.
A single-molecule amplifier was implemented by C. Joachim and J.K. Gimzewski in IBM Zurich. This
experiment involving a single molecule demonstrated that a single molecule can provide gain in a circuit just by playing with through intramolecular quantum interference effects.
A collaboration of researchers at HP and UCLA, led by James Heath, Fraser Stoddart, R. Stanley Williams, and Philip Kuekes, has developed molecular electronics based on rotaxanes and catenanes.
Work is also being done on the use of single-wall carbon nanotubes as field-effect transistors. Most of this work is being done by IBM.
Some specific reports of a field-effect transistor based on molecular self-assembled monolayers were shown to be fraudulent in 2002 as part of the Schön scandal.
Until recently entirely theoretical, the Aviram-Ratner model for a unimolecular rectifier has been unambiguously-confirmed in experiments by a group led by Geoffrey J. Ashwell at Bangor University, UK. Many rectifying molecules have so far been identified, and the number and efficiency of these systems is expanding rapidly.
Supramolecular electronics is a new field that tackles electronics at a supramolecular level.
An important issue in molecular electronics is the determination of the resistance of a single molecule (both theoretical and experimental). For example, Bumm, et al. used STM to analyze a single molecular switch in a self-assembled monolayer to determine how conductive such a molecule can be. Another problem faced by this field is the difficulty of performing direct characterization since imaging at the molecular scale is often difficult in many experimental devices.

Scott Ritcher is a magazine publisher and graphic designer from Louisville, Kentucky, born September 27, 1969.
Ritcher is the publisher of K Composite Magazine and runs a small publishing house also called K Composite. The magazine contains interviews of his friends and other people who are not famous. The magazine has been featured in Rolling Stone, The Chicago Tribune, and on Talk of the Nation on NPR.
He is the former proprietor of the Slamdek Record Company which released early recordings by influential punk and indie rock bands including Endpoint, Rodan, Jawbox, and Ritcher's own bands Sunspring and the Metroschifter. The label's first release was a cassette tape by the synthesizer band Pink Aftershock in 1986 and its last was a Sunspring retrospective CD in 1995. Slamdek pressed 44 different records during its nine years in business.
In 1998, Ritcher entered politics as the Reform Party's candidate for Mayor of Louisville. Though he spent only $1000 on the campaign, Ritcher had a respectable showing at the polls and finished third of four candidates.
He announced his candidacy in early 2008 as an independent candidate for Kentucky Senate from District 35. A controversial lawsuit brought by the Democratic incumbent Denise Harper Angel eventually disqualified Ritcher from the race.
Angel's suit alleged that some of the signatures gathered on Ritcher's ballot petition were those of voters living outside the lines of Kentucky's State Senate District 35 and therefore inadmissible. Reporting the verdict, the political site Page One Kentucky published the entire court order and noted, "while votes for Ritcher will no longer be counted, the court still backs Ritcher’s honesty by plainly stating that the district boundaries that create the 35th Senate District are confusing."
In 2008, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported that his company K Composite "has completed the sale of its social networking site EggFly.com to a startup company, Ikimbo 2.0 of Radnor, Pennsylvania." According to the bio on his campaign website, he has been a contributor to LEO, Velocity Weekly, College Music Journal, public radio's This American Life, and appeared as a newspaper photographer in the 1999 film "The Insider".
Sunspring reunited on May 14, 2010, with Endpoint for a cancer benefit for Jason Noble of Rodan and Rachel's.

Joe Bergin (Gaelic footballer)

Joe Bergin is a Gaelic footballer from Mountbellew County Galway. He was a member of the Galway panel from 2000 to 2012. He plays his club football with Mountbellew-Moylough.
Playing career.
Bergin's rise at a young age was meteoric. He burst onto the scene in 2000 as part of a Galway side that reached that year's All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final; losing to Kerry after a replay.
A regular in the team during that campaign as a replacement for the injured Kevin Walsh, Bergin made a quick impression. Standing at 6"4, he has height but he also showed that he possessed good football skills and had a penchant for kicking valuable points.
At this time, Bergin was a key member of the Galway Under-21 team and his impressive performances for the Under-21's as they secured a Connacht title showed the Senior Management team that he deserved a starting place in Galway's Championship campaign in their first game against New York. In the three games that followed, Sligo, Leitrim and Kildare, Bergin cemented his place as a regular in the side, despite his relative experience at the Senior inter-county level. That year culminated in an All-Ireland Final against Kerry. Unforutnately for Bergin and Galway, Kerry were triumphant in the replay. That year, he was named the All Stars Young Footballer of the Year.
The next year, Bergin was an assured starter but Galways campaign to go one better in 2001 came unstuck after an unexpected defeat to Roscommon in Tuam. Galway had to go through the newly introduced qualifiers to have any chance of All-Ireland glory. Their quest began to pick up momentum with victories over Wicklow, Armagh, and Cork. They exacted revenge over Roscommon in the quarter finals with a 0-14 to 1-06 victory. A late comeback, inspired by Derek Savage, gave Galway a three point victory over Derry in the semi-final. Galway were in their 3rd All-Ireland final in 4 years, and Bergin was an influential player on their way to the final, scoring 0-09 along the way. In the final against Meath, who had annihilated reigning champions Kerry in the other semi-final, Galway outclassed the Meath team in some style, winning by 9 points, 0-17 to 0-08. Bergin contributed with 2 points, making up for his disappointment the previous year when he did not start in the Replay against Kerry. He finished as Galways 2nd top scorer that year behind Pádraic Joyce
In 2002, Galway secured another Connacht title but lost to Kerry in the quarter finals. However, redemption arrived on the Under-21 scene for Bergin. He captained the team on their way to a 0-15 to 0-08 victory over a much fancied Dublin side.
In recent years, Galway have failed to reach the same heights as their early millennium triumphs. They have failed to go past the quarter final stage, losing to Donegal after a replay in 2003, and to Cork in 2005. Although Bergin is a key member of the Galway team, he has lacked a partnership in the midfield similar to the one he enjoyed with Seán Ó Domhnaill and Kevin Walsh at the start of his career. Injuries to Bergin have also dented Galway's progress in the Championship in recent years. During Peter Forde's time in charge, Galway reached 3 Connacht finals but won just one of those, against Mayo in 2005. In 2006 and 2007, Galway lost their first qualifier after both Connacht Final disappointments.
Although Liam Sammon has brought success and a positive outlook to Galway football since his appointment in September 2007, Bergin has seen much of it from the sideline. On 6 April 2008, Bergin suffred an Achilles tendon injury in a League game against Mayo. After he underwent surgery, it was expected he would be out for four months. So far, Bergin has missed the rest of the 2008 National League season and Galway's 3 games in the Championship, where they went on to win their first Connacht title in 3 years with a 2-12 to 1-14 victory over Mayo. It was reported that he had regained full fitness and could play some part in Galway's quarter-final clash against Kerry in August. Bergin won a place on the bench for the showdown and was introduced in the second half for Paul Conroy. Not long after his introduction, a long high ball from Pádraic Joyce dropped towards the Kerry goal and Bergin managed to fist it past Declan O'Sullivan to give Galway a two point lead. However, they could not make their advantage count as Kerry ran out 1-21 to 1-16 winners at the final whistle.
Bergin is also a nephew of former Tipperary hurling captains Jack and Liam Bergin, and a cousin to former Meath footballer Paul Shankey
In October 2012 Bergin announced his retirement from Inter-County football after 12 years on the panel.

Makoura College

Makoura College (spelled Makora College prior to 1990) is a state co-educational secondary school located in Masterton, New Zealand
History.
Makoura College was established in 1968 to cope with an expanding youth population in the Masterton district. It began with a roll of approximately 800, and was governed by the same Board of Governors as nearby Wairarapa College.
The college was sited on the Eastern side of Masterton, close to several primary schools, and a then government-owned printing press.
During the 'Tomorrow's Schools' reforms of the late 1980s, a stand-alone Board of Trustees was instated.
Facilities.
The school's classrooms are largely contained within two Nelson Blocks, although a technology block and arts block also house classes pertaining to their subject areas. The school also contains a hall, library, gymnasium, multi-purpose sports turf and Teen Parent Unit for teen parents. Makoura College also boasts a state of the art computer lab with 25 PCs.
2011 - The school is undergoing a huge refurbishment with one of the two Nelson blocks being stripped and rebuilt to house the junior school - Te Kura Teina - years 9 and 10 as well as the Wharenui. The other Nelson block is being demolished to make way for new classrooms.
Potential closure.
In early April 2008, a private meeting was held between the Ministry of Education, the Makoura College Board of Trustees chairperson and the Wairarapa College board chairperson. Since the meeting, the Makoura College Board has disclosed that it feels that the college should be merged with nearby Wairarapa College or closed. The board blamed the closure on a declining roll, which it suggested was the result of a declining population and "the socio-economic, racist and snobbish attitudes that have
developed in Masterton around the so-called East/West divide". A public meeting was held to discuss the consultation, and submissions were invited to the Board of Trustees, with approximately 225 being received. College students initiated a petition in support of the school, which received approximately 7,512 signatures. Local Member of Parliament John Hayes has come out in support of the school, and has suggested the replacement of the school's management.
On the 7th of August, 2008, the Board of Trustees announced its resignation The Board has since been replaced by a commissioner, Tim White. The Principal, Chris Scott, also resigned.
A new principal was appointed in December 2008 and the school has continued attracting an improved year 9 role in 2009 and seems to be building towards a stronger future despite working with difficult students and a shortage of funding.
Former pupil Jemaine Clement and Flight of the Conchords partner Bret McKenzie played a benefit concert to a sold-out local audience of 2000 on March 31, 2009, giving the school both a financial boost and a powerful show of support for the school and its pupils.

Home Town Hero

Hometown Hero was a post-grunge band from Southern California active in the early 2000s. Founding members Aaron Bruno and Drew Stewart began playing together while attending Westlake High School, where their early project was known as the Ice Monkeys. They were greatly influenced by the success of Southern California punk bands of the early 1990s and the Grunge aesthetic popularized by bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. With the later addition of bassist Todd Burns and drummer Ray Blanco the band re-christened themselves as Insurgence. As Insurgence they began playing famous California venues, including The Roxy Theatre and Whisky a Go Go.
When the band began work on their demo EP they again changed their name, this time to "Home Town Hero". In 2000 and 2001 Home Town Hero joined the Van's Warped Tour, where they attracted the attention of Madonna's Maverick Records label. The band's eponymous major label debut was heavily promoted by Warner Bros. Records, and their single "Questions" received significant airplay in major American radio markets. "Questions" was also included in the video game soundtrack for "Legends of Wrestling II". 
Hometown Hero split up shortly before releasing their second LP, "Bitch City", in 2004. The album did not see a physical release, but was freely available to download on the internet. The track "Robbers" was selected by EA Sports for the soundtrack to their MVP Baseball 2004 video game.[http://www.madden04.com/maddenplanet/newsdata/eafans/reviews/1108554795.shtml]
Vocalist Aaron Bruno and guitarist Drew Stewart went on to found Under the Influence of Giants under the Island Records label in 2005, then to Awolnation. 
Ray Blanco is now Drummer/Songwriter of The Bangkok Five (Universal Records/Execution style 2006, Sony/Long Live Crime 2008, Indiemedia, Inc 2010). A&R/Writer/Producer/Partner of Fundamental Music.

Trinity (TV series)

Trinity is a British drama series which was broadcast on ITV2 from September to November 2009. The series is set in the fictional "Trinity College" of "Bridgeford University", and stars Charles Dance, Claire Skinner, Antonia Bernath, Christian Cooke, Reggie Yates and Isabella Calthorpe.
Plot overview.
A new academic year begins at the ancient and prestigious Trinity College, Bridgeford University, and among the new students is Charlotte Arc (Antonia Bernath), whose father Richard Arc (Nick Sidi) was formerly a student and then professor at the college. Richard left the institution suddenly some years earlier and had never explained why, and two weeks before Charlotte is due to join the college, he is found dead in mysterious circumstances. Convinced that her father's death is in some way linked to the college, Charlotte enrolls determined to try to uncover the truth.
As Charlotte and her fellow students settle in, they begin to realise that all is not what it seems at Trinity. Beneath the glossy, glamorous veneer lurks a much darker world, governed by strict codes of conduct and secret societies, most notably the mysterious Dandelion Club whose members are among the college's wealthiest and most privileged students who are used to getting their own way.
A progressive new Warden of the college, Dr Angela Donne (Claire Skinner), is trying to modernize the institution. But she has a fight on her hands from those determined to preserve the old order, including the arrogant and sinister Dean, Dr Edmund Maltravers (Charles Dance), and the spoiled and manipulative President of the Dandelion Club, Dorian Gaudain (Christian Cooke), backed by his father, the interfering Lord Ravensby (Anthony Calf). 
Besides Charlotte, the new group of students trying to find their way in the college include the streetwise and fiercely intelligent Theo Mackenzie (Reggie Yates), the poetry-loving hopeless romantic Maddy Talbot (Elen Rhys), Dorian's stunning but emotionally-cold cousin Rosalind Gaudain (Isabella Calthorpe), and the lost stoners Angus (Mark Wood) and Raj (Arnab Chanda).
When the college's champion rower, Ross Bonham (David Oakes), turns up dead, a mysterious series of events begins to unfold. But those charged with protecting the secrets that lie within Trinity's ancient halls of learning aren't about to give them up without a fight.
Production.
The series was filmed primarily on the campus of Royal Holloway, University of London, with most scenes taking place in or around the Founder's Building.

Gunpowder Empire

Gunpowder Empire is an alternate history novel by Harry Turtledove. It is the first part of the Crosstime Traffic series.
Plot summary.
In the novel, Jeremy and Amanda Solter are two teenagers living in the late 21st century. Their parents work for Crosstime Traffic, a trading company using time travel to go back and forth from parallel versions of Earth to trade for resources to help sustain their version of Earth. One summer, the children work with their parents, going to Polisso - in our timeline a village in Romania with ancient ruins nearby, in the alternate timeline a major city of a Roman Empire that never collapsed.
In the intervening centuries, the Romans advanced to the extent of inventing gunpowder - hence the title of the book - putting their armies on about 17th Century level. By 2100 they had not, however, gone through an industrial revolution and much of their social institutions, in particular slavery, remain as much as they were in earlier Roman times. North of the Roman Empire, a rival Lietuvan Empire has grown up, with occasional wars breaking out between the two. It is said that most of these wars would end in an exchange of border provinces. Romans consider the Lietuvans as "barbarians", though in fact the two have much the same level of technology and culture.
When the youngsters' mother becomes sick, their father takes her back to their home time for treatment, expecting to come back in a few days - but the cross-time travel equipment suffers a break in link, stranding Jeremy and Amanda in Polisso just as the Lietuvan Army crosses the border, placing Polisso under siege. At the same time, the Roman authorities begin to grow suspicious of their trade mission and the origin of such items as watches and Swiss army knives which they offer for sale and which no artisan in the Empire can match.
Map.
While the book is not entirely clear on the borders of the Lietuvan Empire and the Roman Empire in AD 2100, it does give a few hints. Dark blue areas in the map are areas under Roman control. Blue areas are areas that are probably are under Roman control but are not mentioned. Light blue areas are contested areas. Brown areas are the Lietuvans.
Reception.
Roland J. Green reviewing for Booklist said "Seemingly a series opener intended to introduce the concept of parallel worlds and Turtledove’s take on it, the book succeeds as an homage to parallelworlds pioneer Piper and a well-told, engaging tale. Peter Cannon reviewing for Publishers Weekly said "Turtledove presents his teenaged heroes with a series of moral choices and dilemmas that will particularly resonate with younger fans. This is a rousing story that reminds us that "adventure" really is someone else in deep trouble a long way off." Don D'Ammassa in his review for the Journal Chronicle praised the novel saying "I really enjoyed this one, which had lively characters and events, and whose setting seemed much more interesting and better realized than that in the author s other recent novels."

Daisy Lake, also referred to as Daisy Lake Reservoir, is a reservoir on the Cheakamus River in the Sea to Sky Corridor of southwestern British Columbia, Canada, just south of the Resort Municipality of Whistler and immediately north of the abandoned townsite of Garibaldi (which until 1932 had been also named Daisy Lake). Daisy Lake Dam was built in the 1950s with the reservoir created merging the former natural Daisy Lake and another named Shadow Lake. The reservoir supplies the Cheakamus Powerhouse on the Squamish River via a tunnel bored beneath the mountain range dividing the two rivers.
There is a BC Hydro-operated recreation area just above the dam, and public campgrounds and picnic tables at Brandywine Falls Provincial Park, which is near the head of the lake. The upper reaches of the lake are visible from viewing platform on the north side of the falls and also from points along the hiking trails lining the cliff edge above the Cheakamus River north and south of the falls.
The northern, western and southwestern sides of Daisy Lake are influenced by lava flows composing the Cheakamus Valley basalts.

Pușcă Automată model 1986

The Pușcă Automată model 1986 (Automatic Rifle Model 1986, abbreviated "PA md. 86" or simply "md. 86") is the standard assault rifle used by the Romanian Military Forces and manufactured in Cugir, Romania by firm RomArm S.A. located in Bucharest, Romania. The export name for this variant is the AIMS-74.
History.
As the Soviet Union switched from the 7.62×39mm caliber AK-47 to the 5.45×39mm caliber AK-74, it encouraged other nations of the Warsaw Pact to follow suit.
By the mid 80s, Romania decided to switch calibers, however it was decided that the new rifle be developed independently, and not represent a clone of the Soviet AK-74. In doing so, the PA md. 86 has several anachronistic AKM elements that were found only on the prototype Soviet AK-74.
Features.
The most easily recognized AKM feature is the gas block design (45 degree versus 90 degree). Incidentally, although the gas block is purely AKM, the gas vent in the barrel did change to a 90 degree design to minimize bullet shearing (a problem with early Soviet AK-74's with 45 degree gas blocks). This means the Romanian AK-74 has a double angle gas port, which makes it much harder to clean the gas vent. This variant also uses the AK-47 rear trunnion, and thus the siderail is lengthened.
It uses either the bird-cage flash suppressor, or a flash hider (designed for Special Forces). The design also incorporated an upward curved charging handle, a wire sidefolder, based on the East German design, but offset slightly to the left, and the traditional vertical handgrip. The md. 86 use laminated wood lower handguards, and Bakelite pistol grips and upper handguards. None of the components have had any polymer versions.
The AG-40 grenade launcher can be attached as a lower handguard after removing the standard one. Lasers/lights can also be clamped to the barrel in two ways. The rifle is one of only a few AK versions that have a 3-round burst option. The selector markings are as follows, from top to bottom: ∞, 1, 3. Only ribbed steel magazines are used.
Combat divers also use a version with straight handguards, as the grip is considered to be cumbersome for amphibious operations.
Variants.
Carbine version.
This rifle also has a rarely seen short barrel version, PA md. 86 cu țeavă scurtă ("short barreled PA md. 86"), where the front sight is placed on the gas block, with the gas tube being shortened. This version uses both straight and laminate grip handguards.
Civilian variants.
The 5.45mm civilian export versions are: Romak 992, Romak 2, Intrac Mk II, CUR-2, WUM-2, SAR 2, and the WASR 2 which is the current production rifle. The WASR 2 doesn't have a dimpled receiver, as opposed to previous models.
5.45mm RPK.
The RPK version of the md. 86 is called the md. 93. It features a long reinforced receiver, a carry handle, and a bipod. An earlier, short-lived version used a fire control group similar to the 7.62mm md. 64, ""Safe - Auto - Single"". The md. 93 changed this to the md. 86 style ""Safe - Auto - Single - Burst"".

<doc id="18696021" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18696021" title="John Thompson (actor)">
John Thompson (actor)

John Thompson (died December 1634) was a noted boy player acting women's roles in English Renaissance theatre. He served in the King's Men, the acting troupe formerly of William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage.
Thompson's career is notable for his length. Some boy actors, like John Honyman and Stephen Hammerton, filled female roles for only three to five years before switching to male roles; others, like Richard Sharpe, appear to have continued in women's roles for a decade. Thompson is known to have played women for at least ten years, if not more.
Beginnings.
Thompson began as an apprentice of veteran comedian and teacher John Shank. In 1636, Shank claimed in legal testimony to have spent £40 to acquire Thompson as an apprentice. (Apprentices' contracts were sometimes purchased from their "masters," as with the case of Stephen Hammerton.) 
According to the cast list in the 1623 first edition of Webster's "The Duchess of Malfi", Thompson played Julia, the "Cardinals Mis." This is Thompson's earliest known part.
The cast list refers to two separate productions, the original of c. 1614 and a revival of c. 1621. When different actors played a role in the two stagings, the list identifies them: the parts of Ferdinand, the Cardinal, and Antonio were filled by different actors in the two productions. The cast list gives the role of the Cardinal's mistress Julia to Thompson in both productions; but this has been greeted with skepticism by some commentators, who think Thompson played the role only in the revival of c. 1621. C. 1614 is an early date for the start of Thompson's career, but it is not impossible, and no evidence contradicts the idea.
Middle years.
Thompson's last known female role was as Panopia in the company's production of Wilson's "The Swisser" in 1631. In between he had roles in Ford's "The Lover's Melancholy", and in "The Lovers' Progress", "The Maid in the Mill", and "The Pilgrim", three plays in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. He also played Domitia in "The Roman Actor" (1626), and Honoria in "The Picture" (1629), both by Philip Massinger, plus Cleonarda in Carlell's "The Deserving Favourite" (also 1629) and Miniona Undermine in Clavell's "The Soddered Citizen" (1630).
Thompson appears to have had a penchant for playing formidable and dominant women, like Honoria the queen or Cleonarda the huntress. More conventionally female roles went to other boy actors. This must reveal something about Thompson's personal characteristics and acting skills. It may also suggest other parts he could likely have taken. For example, no cast information survives for the King's Men's production of Massinger's "The Duke of Milan" (c. 1622); but Marcelia, the heroine in that play, is another formidable beauty like Cleonarda or Honoria, and a role that Thompson might have played.
Last years.
Thompson fades from view after 1631; but the very patchy records of the era may obscure the fact that he simply continued acting. He was named a Groom of the Chamber on 15 April 1633, which certainly suggests a continuing career. (Actors were sometimes rewarded with the honorific post; Honyman was named a Groom of the Chamber along with Thompson, and five King's Men became Grooms in January 1641.)
The parish records of St. Giles without Cripplegate, which was the home of many theatre people of the day and located near the Fortune Playhouse, note two Thompson daughters in 1631 — the christening of Anne on 16 July and the burial of Lettice on 1 October. Thompson's funeral was held in the same parish on 13 December 1634.

Brandon Paris Band

Brandon Paris Band is a Canadian rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Brandon Paris started the band in 2002. The band performs a fusion of pop, rock, reggae, punk and soul. They have gained a huge amount of popularity in many parts of Canada and attained an already significant fan base across Canada before they signed a deal with Koch Entertainment in January 2006. They released their first song "Rewind and Start Again" in March 2006, from their debut album titled "On My Own", which after a few months hit Top 20, peaking at No. 17 on the Canadian CHR charts. The second single almost reached top 40 at No. 53 CHR, Topping off an already exceptional year, Brandon Paris Band was nominated for Best New Group or Solo Artist (CHR) by the Canadian Radio Music Awards in spring of 2007 in 2006.
Name.
The band is named after the lead singer, Brandon Paris, who was originally a solo artist and changed the name from "Brandon Paris" to "Brandon Paris Band" in 2006 right before the official release of the album. He decided to add "Band" at the end of his name as he thought it was easier than having to start over from scratch with marketing a new band name.
History.
In 2002 Paris was approached by Dave Devindisch (former bassist of the Vancouver band DDT) at a concert where he asked if he would be interested in recording a demo at his home studio. Brandon agreed and soon after, Dave and Brandon formed a two man band playing at local venues. In 2003, Paris decided to finally record a full album with Ninjabeatz Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia, where reggae artist Dagriff was recording his solo album. Dagriff was approached by Paris and asked if he would be interested in collaborating on one song from the album he was recording. Soon after, Dagriff joined the band and became a huge influence on the band's music. Dagriff was eventually featured on more than half the album which took over two full years to eventually complete. In 2004, Greg Ellis was asked if he would play guitar on a couple songs for the album which resulted in him joining the band as well. In 2005, Chris Murray Driver, who was friends with Dave Devindisch, joined the band, and only a few months later talked his friend Marc Gladstone (keyboards) into joining the band. Both Marc and Chris are former members of the band Doug and the Slugs.
In spring 2005, Paris tried to release the songs independently to radio with no success. A few months later he approached Vancouver-based record producer Troy Samson of Hipjoint Productions (Moka Only, Kreesha Turner, Snoop Dogg) and Jeff Dawson (State of Shock, Kelly Rowland, Daniel Powter, Marcy Playground), to rework six of the original recordings. This took the whole project to a new level. Paris changed the name from "Brandon Paris" to "Brandon Paris Band" and decided they were finally ready to shop their debut album now titled "On My Own".
in January 2006, Brandon Paris Band signed a deal with Koch Entertainment literally overnight just days after sending out their album to record labels across Canada, with many offers following. Their debut albums' first single, "Rewind and Start Again", was a huge success on commercial radio after being released on March 13, 2006. The song climbed up to top 20 on the Canadian CHR charts (tracked by Radio & Records (Billboard Information Group)). "Somebody to Hold" was also well received in many cities and reached almost top 40 status peaking at No. 53. Koch Entertainment, Brandon Paris Band's record label, decided to release "Give Me a Reason (song)|Give Me a Reason" only a month after the release of "Somebody to Hold", in hopes of getting better results, but to their dismay it wasn't enough to reach top 40 status. "Give Me a Reason" unfortunately peaked at No. 77 on CHR. Topping off an already exceptional year, Brandon Paris Band was nominated for Best New Group or Solo Artist (CHR) by the Canadian Radio Music Awards in spring of 2007. 
In January 2007, Ellis and Devindisch were replaced by Bryan Jasper on guitar and Brian Sanheim on bass. 
On November 3, 2008, Brandon Paris Band independently released their first single called "Say Goodbye" from their 2nd album titled "Pocket Full of Holes" to radio. "Say Goodbye", mixed by Mike Fraser (AC/DC; Hedley) and mastered by Adam Ayan (Rolling Stones; Linkin Park), is currently receiving airplay across Canada, including reporting stations, digital stations and satellite. Additional credits on "Pocket Full of Holes" include Jeff Dawson (State of Shock, Kelly Rowland, Daniel Powter, Marcy Playground; State of Shock) and Sheldon Zaharko (Billy Talent) at Vancouver's legendary Factory Studios. To add to the success of “Say Goodbye”, a video was filmed for the song which was directed, shot, and edited by the lead singer himself with a $4.00 budget. The band put the video on iTunes and received so much attention that it got mentioned on radio stations across Canada and ended up getting airplay on Much Music.
"Pocket Full of Holes" was released in Canada December 1 of 2008.

Robert Fruin

Robert Jacobus Fruin (Rotterdam, November 11, 1823 – Leiden, January 29, 1899) was a Dutch historian, who as a follower of Leopold von Ranke introduced the scientific study of history in the Netherlands, when he was professor of Dutch national history () at Leiden University.
Biography.
Fruin, a lifelong bachelor, studied classical philology at Leiden University from 1842, and received his Ph.D. on December 18, 1847 with a dissertation on Manetho, entitled "De Manethone Sebennytha". As he was a man of independent means, he spent the next two years in independent studies and political pursuits in Utrecht, before he accepted a position as praeceptor (teacher) in history at Leiden Gymnasium in 1850.
These were tumultuous times in Dutch constitutional history as the liberal 1848 Dutch constitutional reform by Johan Rudolf Thorbecke had just been completed, and was the subject of heated political debate. In this debate Fruin took the liberal side and he conducted a learned polemic with a fellow eminent Dutch historian, who was also a leader of the Conservative opposition to the new political ideas, Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer. Though the polemic was courteous, it would inaugurate a certain coolness in the professional and personal relationships between the two men, that would last during their careers.
They would cross swords in their professional fields also. Groen van Prinsterer had a style of historiography that was more poetic than Fruin thought appropriate. He shared that style with the American historian John Lothrop Motley who would use his archival work on William the Silent in his own work on the Dutch Republic: "The Rise of the Dutch Republic", which caused a furore in the Netherlands. Though Fruin had much sympathy for Motley's work, he also was prompted by it to do his own original research on the events leading up to the Dutch Revolt, and on the crucial years of that Revolt, which led him to completely different conclusions. He published these in "Het Voorspel van den Tachtigjarigen oorlog" (Prologue to the Eighty Years' War) and "Tien jaren uit den Tachtigjarigen oorlog" (Ten years from the Eighty Years' War).
In a later review of Motley's "History of the United Netherlands" Fruin politely criticized Motley's tendency to take highly partisan points of view (however flattering those might be to Dutch national heroes) and his regrettable habit of introducing events that made "good stories" but never actually happened.
In his inaugural oration (held on July 1, 1860) after his appointment as the first professor of Dutch national history at Leiden University on February 20, 1860 (which was preceded by his promotion to prorector of his gymnasium in 1859), which was entitled "Onpartijdigheid van den geschiedschrijver" (Impartiality of the historian), Fruin defended the point of view that historians needed to be impartial in their historiography. He did not deny that pure objectivity was an unattainable ideal, and he himself was known for his partisan standpoints, but he thought that historians should take the point of view of their subjects into account, even if they vehemently disagreed with that point of view, and try to represent it in a fair way.
As such he showed himself to be an adept of Leopold von Ranke, whom he highly esteemed. He helped introduce Ranke's ideas about historiography in the Netherlands and to spread his influence on Dutch historiography in the second half of the 19th century, giving the Dutch profession of historiography a more "scientific" flavor.
Fruin was not a very inspiring lecturer. His lectures were better known for their thoroughness and quality, than for their oratory. Nevertheless, he was popular as a professor. The same thoroughness that characterized his lectures, also characterized his historical research. He was averse to writing large historical handbooks, preferring the elegant little monograph, of which he published many in the literary magazine "De Gids", and in the specialized historical journal "Nijhoff's Bijdragen". He specialized in certain historical periods and subjects, like the early years of the Dutch Republic and the stadtholderate of stadtholder William III. He limited his academic subject, "Vaderlandsche Geschiedenis" to the history of the Dutch Republic, ending in 1795, as he thought more recent history (which, after all, was only half a century old in his time) as yet too unsettled to be properly handled.
Beside his interpretive historical work, he also published two important compilations of sources:
His defense of impartiality in historiography as a matter of principle did not prevent him from taking a stand occasionally, if he felt truth and fairness made it necessary. His polemics with Catholic revisionist historians of the time, about what he felt were their distortions of histrorical truth in their support of the struggle for Emancipation of the long-repressed Catholic minority in the Netherlands, are legendary. Though as a liberal he sympathized with their political objectives, he objected to what he saw as slanders of his histrorical heroes. To show that he could give Catholics their due he wrote his article "De Gorcumsche martelaren" (The martyrs of Gorkum) in 1865, about a famous atrocity perpetrated against Catholic priests by the Sea Beggars.
Another characterizing example is the altercation he had with general Willem Jan Knoop, a Dutch military historian, about the question whether stadtholder William III had known of the fact that the Treaty of Nijmegen had already been signed, when he fought the bloody Battle of Saint-Denis (1678). Fruin thought that William spoke the truth when he swore that he had not known. However, new material brought to light that he must have known, and this so shocked Fruin's faith in William that he everafter displayed a distinct coolness to this heretofore revered subject.
Fruin reluctantly retired from his professorship in 1894, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. In his "Afscheidsrede" (Farewell Address) of June 1, 1894, he was able to point to the many advances Dutch historiography had made during his professional career. This was mainly thanks to him, but he was too modest to claim it was all his doing, or even that he had founded a "school". He died five years later after a short illness.
His successor was P.J. Blok.

Diphenylethylenediamine

1,2-Diphenyl-1,2-ethylenediamine is an organic compound with the formula H2NCHPhCHPhNH2, where Ph is C6H5, phenyl. This diamine is a precursor to a ligand for certain homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. It can be prepared from benzil by reductive amination.
Optical resolution.
DPEN can be obtained as both the chiral and meso diastereomers, depending on the relative stereochemistry of the two CHPhNH2 subunits. The chiral diastereomer, which is of greater value, can be resolved into the R,R- and S,S- enantiomers using tartaric acid as the resolving agent. In methanol, the R,R enantiomer has an specific rotation of [α]23 +106±1°.
TsDPEN.
N-tosylated derivative, TsDPENH, is a ligand precursor for catalysts for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. For example (cymene)Ru(S,S-TsDPEN) catalyzes the hydrogenation of benzil into "R,R"-hydrobenzoin. In this reaction, formate serves as the source of H2:
This transformation is an example of desymmetrization, the symmetric molecule benzil is converted to the dissymmetric product
Applications.
DPEN and BINAP are the key ingredients of Noyori's 2nd Generation Ruthenium based chiral hydration catalyst, Ryōji Noyori earned the Nobel Prize in 2001.

Personal Demon

Personal Demon, a fantasy novel published in 2008, is the eighth book in the Women of the Otherworld series written by Canadian author Kelley Armstrong. It is the first novel in the series to have more than one narrator and the first to include a male narrator.
Plot introduction.
Half-demon tabloid reporter Hope Adams has a secret. Like full demons, she loves chaos. She thrives on it. She needs it. 
Most of the time, Hope feeds the hunger by helping the interracial council. But it's never enough. So when Benicio Cortez offers her a job infiltrating a gang of young supernaturals, she thinks she's found the perfect solution. Instead, she finds a tinderbox of greed, desire and ambition. And when it ignites, a world is going to explode
Plot summary.
The initial story is mainly narrated by Hope Adams an Expiso half-demon with other events being narrated by Lucas Cortez, a sorcerer. In the latter parts of the story the narrating is more evenly distributed between the two characters. Chapters narrated by Hope are given chapter titles while those narrated by Lucas are given chapter numbers.
Hope Adams works as a tabloid journalist for the fictional newspaper True News and also for the inter-racial council. Hope's Expiso half-demon nature gives her the ability to sense other supernatural's powers, detect chaos and experience visions of chaotic events. While investigating a story she is approached by Benicio Cortez, CEO of the Cortez cabal and father of Lucas Cortez, with an offer of a job which would repay Hope's debt to him.
A rebel gang of young supernaturals led by Guy Benoit has come to notice of the Cortez cabal. The job offer is simple - to investigate the rebel gang. But the bigger worry is if Hope will be able to keep her instinct and lust for chaos in check. As Hope discovers more about the gang and starts a relationship with a particularly charismatic member Jaz, her ex lover, the werewolf thief Karl Marsten, arrives to help and honour his half of the debt. The two find the situation may not be as simple as they thought.
With Hope infiltrating the gang, two members of the gang are abducted and a third killed, apparently by the Cortez cabal. This prompts Lucas Cortez and Paige Winterbourne to come to Miami to help Hope and Karl before a war between the rebels and the cabal can destroy them all.

Ninotsminda Cathedral

Ninotsminda Cathedral () (c. 575) is located in the village of Sagarejo, in the Kakheti region, Georgia.
Ninotsminda Cathedral is highly significant to the development of Georgian architecture, as it predates Jvari Monastery in Mtskheta, and served as a model for the development of the later tetraconch (four-apse) form. The site is ruins today, with only the eastern apse and a portion of the western wall remaining. The ruined apse is decorated with 16th century frescos of the Hodegetria, severely vandalised with bullet holes from Dagestani bandits in the 18th and 19th centuries. Outlines of the foundations indicate that the church originally had an octagonal center, surrounded by corner niches. Historical records indicate that restoration work was undertaken in the 10th and 11th centuries, and also during 1671 and 1774. However, the cathedral collapsed during earthquakes in 1824 and 1848 and was not reconstructed.
The large brick belltower within the same complex dates from the reign of King Levan of Kakheti (1520-1574). The lower three stories served as a residence, each floor with a fireplace. The staggered placement of bricks on the exterior façade to form geometric patterns indicates the cultural influence of Safavid Persia, as does the pointed arch over the entrance.
The Ninotsminda complex is surrounded by a fortification, with corner towers and a crenalated curtain wall, dating from the 16th-17th centuries. The fortified entrance gate has protruding towers with beehive machicolations.
The complex is currently operated as a nunnery by the Georgian Orthodox Church, and reconstruction work is underway.

Throughout his young adulthood Dr. Cifarelli spent time working in the Roman Bronze Works foundry, the oldest and longest running foundry in America, in Brooklyn, New York, which was owned and operated by his maternal uncle and which produced some of the most notable bronze sculptures of the 20th Century, including the Heisman Trophy, the statue of Thomas Jefferson in the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., the Iwo-Jima Memorial In Washington, D.C., the statue of Atlas at Rockefeller Center, New York and many other iconic pieces. It was there where Dr. Cifarelli developed an interest in bronze sculpture that lasted throughout his lifetime.
Education and Early Medical Career.
Dr. Cifarelli showed very little ability or interest in academics during his schooling through high school. Rather, he interacted with a "tough crowd" often getting into many physical confrontations all the way through high school—he barely graduated and had numerous disciplinary issues. Consequently, the high school guidance counselor recommended Cifarelli pursue a career involving manual labor and upon graduation gave him an application to the Sanitation Department for the City of New York. This clearly was a turning point in Cifarelli's life and was the beginning of a lifelong pursuit of education and knowledge. Upon graduation from high school Cifarelli did not have high enough grades for general admission to college. Instead, he was allowed to enroll in two college courses on a probationary status during the summer immediately following high school graduation. He earned straight A's in the courses and was accepted into the University; within one year his performance earned him an academic scholarship. Dr. Cifarelli majored in Biology at Long Island University while working nights as an attendant at the famed Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, where he developed a lifelong love of opera. His honors for academic achievement included earning a Departmental Medal in Biology which was presented to him by William Zeckendorf. A natural linguist, Dr. Cifarelli read, wrote and spoke four languages. He spoke two different dialect's of Italian and understood and was semi-conversational in Latin. He was so proficient in French that after his first year of studies in college he became the preferred student-substitute for French class at all levels on campus. He went on to attend medical school at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. On a visit home during medical school he met Jean Abitabile, a New York native, whom he later married. After graduating from Georgetown, Dr. Cifarelli returned to New York City where he practiced medicine for several years, working with well-known New York physicians including Dr. Philip A. LoPresti. During this period Dr. Cifarelli, in collaboration with others, became involved developing and testing the gastroscope, the medical device now commonly used to screen patients for colon cancer. Dr. Cifarelli earned his reputation as one of the pioneers of the medical specialty of Gastroenterology working in many hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens, N.Y. including St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y. where he founded the Gastroenterology Clinic and served as Chief of the Department.
Military Service - Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War.
In 1966, recognizing the dire need created by the Vietnam War for physicians in the military, Dr. Cifarelli voluntarily enlisted in the United States Army. He served in Vietnam from 1966 through 1967, attaining the rank of Captain and serving as Chief of Medicine at the 67th Evac. Hospital in QuiNan, Vietnam. He was awarded a Bronze Star and a Letter of Commendation for his service during the war.
Dr. Cifarelli's respect and admiration for military service never faded. In 1982 he re-joined the Army, in its reserve unit as a Lt. Colonel. Two years later he attained the rank of full Colonel and continued to serve in the U.S. Army Reserves Medical Corps through most of the 1990s. During that period he was named Chief of Medicine and later Commander of the 349th General Hospital in Los Angeles, a unit called to serve in the Persian Gulf War. He also commanded the 458th MASH Unit and later served as a Consultant to the U.S. Army Surgeon General, obtaining a top secret clearance at the Pentagon. As the millennium arrived Dr. Cifarelli finally retired from the military.
Move to California.
In December 1970 Dr. Cifarelli moved his wife and four children to California where his medical career flourished. Through the 1970s and 1980s Dr. Cifarelli served as Chief of Medicine and Chief of Staff at several Orange County hospitals including Good Samaritan Hospital in Anaheim, California. At Good Samaritan in 1978 Dr. Cifarelli met and befriended Ferdinand Waldo Demara aka "the Great Imposter," who was serving as the hospital's chaplain. Recognizing that Demara did not appear to have any family or close relationships, Dr. Cifarelli began regularly inviting Demara to family gatherings at his home. As Chief of Staff, Dr. Cifarelli was also instrumental in helping secure for Demara a place to live in the hospital, where Demara later died. In the 1970s Dr. Cifarelli began teaching clinical medicine at U.C. Irvine Medical School and legal medical subjects at COMP. He ultimately attained the rank of full clinical professor at UCI Medical School and at COMP and held those positions until his death. In 1979 he was named in the First Edition of "The Best Doctors of America."
Early Legal Career.
In the mid 1970s Dr. Cifarelli began attending night school at the Western State College of Law, while continuing his busy career as a physician during the day. He passed the bar and began practicing both law and medicine in 1979, becoming one of the first practicing physicians and attorneys in Orange County. He devoted much of his practice to medical malpractice issues. He later moved his law practice to Santa Ana and continued to practice law for several years, joined in the late 1980s by his oldest son Philip C. Cifarelli, J.D.
Later Legal Career.
After a short semi-retirement in the late 1990s, Dr. Cifarelli returned to the practice of law around 2000, joining the law firm run by his sons including well-known child rights attorney Thomas A. Cifarelli, at The Cifarelli Law Firm, LLP. It was during the second half of his legal career where Dr. Cifarelli took up the cause of representing physicians in legal/ethical issues related to the treatment of patients including the terminally ill.
Teaching and Advocating for Patients' Rights.
Dr. Cifarelli spent much of the second half of his legal and teaching career on bioethics issues on behalf of terminally ill patients seeking the right to die with dignity and the physicians who treat them. Always driven by a love of education and philosophy, Dr. Cifarelli became actively involved with the American College of Legal Medicine, educating practicing physicians and attorneys about cutting edge issues involving Bio-Ethics and the right to death with dignity. He ascended to the rank of President of the American College of Legal Medicine in 2005 and was honored with the organization's Gold Medal for lifetime achievement in March 2008. At COMP Dr. Cifarelli established the school's first Legal Medicine Ethics program in 1978 and taught generations of physicians about the ethical and legal issues doctors face on a daily basis in their care of patients including the terminally ill. Dr. Cifarelli truly loved teaching and his 29 years of lecturing at COMP provided him much joy. In his legal practice Dr. Cifarelli successfully represented many physicians being investigated by the State Medical Board for following patients' wishes and providing advanced end-of-life care to terminally ill and suffering patients. Dr. Cifarelli also promoted awareness of these subjects through his active leadership in the American College of Legal Medicine.
Death and Family.
Dr. Cifarelli was diagnosed with lung cancer in the Summer of 2007. He underwent extensive treatment for the disease until his death. He is survived by his four children Emilia Longo, Nina Longo, Philip C. Cifarelli and Thomas A. Cifarelli, and seven grandchildren Candace, Amanda, Jeanine, Alex, Vincent, Angela and Michael. He is also survived by his younger brother Dr. Albert V. Cifarelli of New York City, and his second wife Barbara. He met his goal, by leaving a positive impact on all the people he left behind.

References.
WZOM signed on the air on Friday August 25, 1989. Its first official programming was a high school football game between Defiance High School and Napoleon High School. The game featured the return of local sports announcer Marv Sebring. Sebring was known for a colorful call of local sports and he had an amazing memory for local sports history. 
For the next two days the station ran a tape loop of three oldies, three country and three random songs asking residents to vote for their favorite format. The oldies format was a fan favorite with a three to one margin over other choices. At 6AM on Monday August 28, 1989 the Zoomer kicked off with a "Classic Rock 40" oldies format. The original staff members were Rich Gates, Bob James, Andie Germann as the morning team, Rich Vargo afternoons, Larry Miller in the evenings. The remainder of the day was basically music from a syndicated music source but the station was so well programmed that community members would want to visit the on-air personalities that were from Dallas Texas. The transitions were seamless.
WZOM was unique to the market as it brought a big city attitude to small town radio, listeners were put on the air, many contests and give aways. Where the other stations were background WZOM dared you to listen. They brought back a jingle package from CKLW which was the station for the 25.54 year olds when they were teens so the ZOOMER had a familiar feel. Many live on location broadcasts were done always with station mascot ZOOMER the Hip Cat there.
The first owner of the station was James Phillips a local insurance man and small town, part-time polka announcer . The corporate name was The Great Wireless Talking Machine, inc. Phillips had hopes of bringing polka music to the air in Defiance. His consultant Chris Cage (WBNS,WBYR) recommended hiring Robert Krouse as General Manager. Krouse decided on the oldies format from the start since no local station was programming the format at that time. The station was highly popular within a few weeks on the air.
Some of the programming included the Birthday Police, Top Five at Five, Motown Mondays, Sensuous Weather with Stacy Stephens, The Original Breakfast with the Beatles. Many character voices were a part of the morning show keeping the station fresh, topical and fun.
Krouse left the station in July 1991 at that time Phillips added talk to part of the programming and within a year sold the station In a distress sale to Richard McBroom owner of WNDH and WONW. Later the station was sold to Clear Channel

Edward Hayward

Sir Edward Waterfield Hayward (10 November 1903 - 13 August 1983) was an Australian businessman, best known for owning and managing John Martin's, a chain of department stores in Adelaide, South Australia, and for instigating the Adelaide Christmas Pageant.
Born in Adelaide, South Australia, Sir Edward was educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide, where he took up polo among other sports that he excelled in. After completing his education, Hayward worked as a jackaroo in New South Wales for several years. He started in the retail sector for the first time in 1929, working for Sydney Snow and Co. Ltd., and moved back to Adelaide in 1931 to join the family business, John Martin's.
One of his first jobs at John Martin's was to visit Canada and the United States to gather ideas from department stores in those countries. It was on this trip that he came up with the idea to start the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, being in particular inspired by the Toronto Santa Claus Parade and by Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. Since the first pageant in 1933, it has become a much loved Adelaide tradition.
During World War II Hayward served in the Australian Army; he was 36 when he enlisted into the army. During the war Hayward noted the popularity of the soft drink Coca-Cola with the Americans. After the war Hayward established a franchise to bottle and sell Coca-Cola in Adelaide. He served either as president or chairman of the franchise for a total of 33 years.
Hayward was chairman of the St John Council in South Australia when, in 1952, it became responsible for ambulance services in that state, and he was made a Knight of the Order in 1959.
He was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 June 1961.
Sir Edward and his wife, Ursula (nee Barr-Smith), were art enthusiasts and built up a magnificent art collection in their Adelaide home "Carrick Hill". The house, its lands, and the collection were bequeathed to the state on Hayward's death, (Lady Hayward having predeceased him), and now form a museum and cultural centre.

Khoury graduated from Damascus University with a bachelor's degree in French literature and she received a diploma from the school of literature in Beirut.
Career.
Khoury's career began in 1957 and has spanned more than 6 decades. In 1959 she shocked the Arab world with a novel in which she wrote openly on love; this breakthrough novel "Ayyam Maahou" (The Days With Him) was the first time a woman had come out so boldly on a subject considered taboo in conservative Syrian society. "Ayyam Maahou" was inspired by a love affair with the legendary Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani. Khoury has more than 20 novels under her name, she also has written many political and literary articles.
Later years.
In 2008, Khoury was appointed literary adivisor to the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. She currently writes for the Syrian governmental newspaper "Al-Baath" on a broad range of political and literary issues.

Union of People's Fedaian of Iran

The Union of People's Fedaian of Iran is a socialist organization that publishes a monthly magazine called "Iran Today". 
The organization was established in April 1994, following the Convention of Unity Congress. It emerged as a response to a series of political, theoretical and organizational discussions between the two currents of Fedaie movement: Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas and Fedaian Organization.
History.
The Union of People's Feaian of Iran emerged from a series of political, theoretical and organizational discussions between the two currents of Fedaie movement: Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas and Fedaian Organization. During the last two decades of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule, members of these two organizations and other combatants, were actively involved in the struggle against his regime.
Revolution.
All of these different groups took part in the Iranian revolution in 1979. Soon after the revolution, they united to fight against the new reactionary regime, which hid itself under the cover of religion. 
While the group had a favorable social and political position from which to organize the people's resistance against the Islamic despotism and to defend the achievements of the revolution, it failed to achieve its goals. Some surmise that this was due to a lack of necessary political experience, an unclear view of how the people could be organized, and no comprehensive agenda to bring about a free, progressive and just society.
In the end, the Islamic medieval dictatorship seemed to benefit from the ignorance and illiteracy of the majority of the population and the organization failed to safeguard the achievements of the revolution.
Split.
The first reaction to this failure resulted in the split of the organization into two parts: the "Majority" and the "Minority". While the split revealed the right and left currents within the organization, a lack of the experience of internal dialogues and democratic standards meant that the splitting currents could not define their ideological, political and organizational differences. This led to more splits within the ranks of the Majority and Minority.
Reunification.
Some people from the left and right currents of previous splits have come back together under the Union of People's Fedaian of Iran banner. 
The right current that is present in the reunified organization continue to promote reformist and conciliatory policies towards the regime. However, it has clearly distinguished itself both theoretically and ideologically from the Majority. When the dissolution of the Majority section into the Tudeh Party of Iran was proposed, this group split from the Majority in defiance. In the following years this current, having learned its lesson from the previous failures, criticized its past policies and gradually returned to the revolutionary left movement. In 1989, the Fedaie Organization of Iran was formed, as a result of the unity between this organization and the Organization for the Emancipation of Labour. (The latter had been established by the former cadres and members of the Minority.)
The left current present in the reunified Union of People's Fedaian of Iran, was initially aligned with the Minority. In spite of its revolutionary stance against the regime, it adopted ultra leftist policies. The Minority also faced several splits because of the lack of a clear agenda.
The progress toward reunification of Fedaies was made possible through the revision of the theoretical principles, proposing clear political lines, dispensing with sectarian attitudes toward unity and coalition, learning from the past failures, and achieving principled understanding about democratic relations among the left forces as well as within the organization ranks.

Summed area table

A summed area table (also known as an integral image) is a data structure and algorithm for quickly and efficiently generating the sum of values in a rectangular subset of a grid. It was first introduced to computer graphics in 1984 by Frank Crow for use with mipmaps. In computer vision, it was first prominently used within the Viola–Jones object detection framework in 2002. However, historically, this principle is very well known in the study of multi-dimensional probability distribution functions, namely in computing 2D (or ND) probabilities (area under the probability distribution) from the respective cumulative distribution functions.
The algorithm.
As the name suggests, the value at any point ("x", "y") in the summed area table is just the sum of all the pixels above and to the left of ("x", "y"), inclusive:
Moreover, the summed area table can be computed efficiently in a single pass over the image, using the fact that the value in the summed area table at ("x", "y") is just:
Once the summed area table has been computed, the task of evaluating any rectangle can be accomplished in constant time with just four array references. Specifically, using the notation in the figure at right, having A=(x0, y1), B=(x1, y1), C=(x1, y0) and D=(x0, y0), the sum of formula_3 over the rectangle spanned by A, B,C and D is just
Extensions.
This method is naturally extended to continuous domains.
The method can be also extended to high dimensional images. If the corners of the rectangle are formula_5 with formula_6 in formula_7, then the sum of image values contained in the rectangle are computed with the formula
where formula_9 is the integral image at formula_10 and formula_11 the image dimension. The notation formula_5 correspond in the example to formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16 and formula_17. In neuroimaging, for example, the images have dimension formula_18 or formula_19, when using voxels or voxels with time-stamp.

1926 Chatham Cup

The 1926 Chatham Cup was the fourth annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with five regional associations (Auckland, Wellington, Waikato, Canterbury, and Otago) each holding separate qualifying rounds. In all, 36 teams entered the 1926 competition, with the overwhelming majority being from the North Island.
Huntly Thistle's club website records that the club beat Pukemiro 6-0 and Hikurangi 4-0 before losing to the eventual finalists North Shore 3-1. These teams, and those known to have qualified as regional champions and/or taken part in island finals brings the list of known entrants to 20.
One unusual feature of the 1926 competition was that three of the four semi-finalist sides were composed largely of staff from three of the country's largest mental hospitals, at Sunnyside, Porirua, and Seacliff.
The 1926 final.
The final was played at the Basin Reserve, Wellington, a change of venue from the previous finals which had been at Newtown Park or Athletic Park. The following year the final briefly returned to Newtown Park, before making its permanent home at the Basin Reserve, a venue which was used regularly until the 1970s.
In the final, played in front of some 4000 spectators, Sunnyside's Archie Trotter became the first player to complete a Chatham Cup final hat-trick. The match was high scoring, but contemporary reports suggest that many opportunities were missed by both teams. H. Pickering put Sunnyside in front after just seven minutes. Archie Trotter doubled the lead for Sunnyside before L. Hipkins scored for North Shore. After the half-time interval Trotter scored two further goals before John Woolley scored a late consolation for North Shore.
Other notable features of the final included the appearance in the North Shore team of both Reg Baxter and Ces Dacre. Baxter was the first player to play for two different sides in Chatham Cup finals, having been part of the successful Seacliff team in the 1923 final. Dacre, while a fine player and New Zealand representative at football, is best remembered as one of New Zealand's foremost early cricketers.

L'Année philologique

"L'Année philologique" ("The Year in Philology") is an index to scholarly work in fields related to the language, literature, history and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. It is the standard bibliographical tool for research in classical studies. Published in print annually since 1928, with the first volume covering the years 1924–1926, it is now also available online by institutional or individual subscription. As of November 2011, the electronic version (APh Online) covers volume years 1924 through 2009. The editorial staff gathers each year's additions from 1,500 periodicals, with an additional 500 articles from collections. 
"L'Année philologique" aims to be the most comprehensive international resource for Ancient Greece and Rome. Entries on journal articles are often accompanied by a very brief abstract that may be in a language other than that of the original. Abstracts are most often in French, English, German, Italian, or Spanish. No abstracts for books are provided, but entries on books include a listing of published reviews. Indexing often lags publication by two or three years.
Because "L'Année philologique" is an index, not a collection, searches find terms only within the bibliographical entry, not the full text of the article (the "full text" search option refers to the contents of "L'Année philologique"). The electronic edition offers a variety of search parameters, with some idiosyncrasies. As of 2013, the database is also available for library subscription via the commercial publisher EBSCO. 
"L'Année philologique" is published by the Société Internationale de Bibliographie Classique with support from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France and several other institutions. Editorial offices are located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Heidelberg, Germany; Lausanne, Switzerland; Genoa, Italy; and Grenada, Spain. It was founded in Paris by the latinist Jules Marouzeau (1878-1964), Professor at the Sorbonne.
To fill the gap between "L'Année philologique" and earlier bibliographies, Marouzeau arranged for the publication of a series of volumes in the same format:

Johnnie's Foodmaster

Johnnie's Foodmaster, more commonly known as simply Foodmaster, was a chain of supermarkets in the Boston Metro Area. It had its headquarters in Chelsea, Massachusetts and all stores were located in the state. On November 18, 2012, all ten stores closed, with six leases being transferred to Austin, Texas–based Whole Foods Market, and one to Quincy–based Stop & Shop; the future of the remaining locations was unknown at the time of closure.
Operation.
Foodmaster operated in a grocery marketplace that has a high degree of competition and many competitors, including Shaw's, Stop & Shop, and Market Basket among others. Foodmaster supermarkets were primarily located in shopping centers with other stores. It was unique in terms of its employee dress code. Cashiers and service and grocery clerks were required to wear a black apron and a white collared shirt.
History.
John DeJesus Sr. opened his first store in East Cambridge, MA in 1947. At the time of the chain's closure, it was controlled by his son, John DeJesus.
The chain operated eleven stores simultaneously at its peak. As competition in the region increased, Johnnie's experimented with ways to better cater to its clientele. The Revere location was subsequently converted in 2010 to a Save-A-Lot, a discount supermarket brand under license from SuperValu. Johnnie's management intended to review each of the other store's shoppers to determine if any other locations in the chain would be good candidates for conversion as well. Citing the economy and competition from nearby Stop & Shop, PriceRite, and Market Basket locations, the Revere Save-A-Lot closed on February 12, 2012.
Closure.
In late August 2012, it was announced that Austin, Texas–based Whole Foods Market was in the early stages of talks to acquire the leases of six of the 10 Johnnie's locations to expand its presence in the region. The fate of the remaining four locations was not disclosed at the time. On October 26, 2012, Johnnie's announced that it had finalized its agreement to sell the leases for its Arlington, Brookline, Charlestown, Melrose, South Weymouth, and Beacon Street Somerville. A week later, it was announced that the remaining stores in Medford, Lynn, Whitman, and Somerville (Alewife Brook Parkway) would be closing as well, with the Medford store becoming a Stop & Shop. Hilco Merchant Resources, an Illinois-based company, was retained to conduct all liquidation sales. The lease for the Alewife Brook Parkway store in Somerville was acquired by Stop & Shop in February 2013.

Pakistan Antarctic Programme

The Pakistan Antarctic Programme (PAP) is a scientific administrative division of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) which represents the Government of Pakistan on the continent of Antarctica. The program coordinates scientific research and operational support in the region. The program is funded by the Pakistan Science Foundation and the Ministry of Science and Technology. 
Currently, the PAP maintains and controls two polar stations in the region: the Jinnah Antarctic Station (JNS), and the Polar Research Cell (PRC), which was established by the National Institute of Oceanography to co-ordinate all Antarctic related activities.
The Antarctic Programme was launched by the National Institute of Oceanography, with the full support of Pakistan Navy's Naval Weapons Engineering Division (NWED). In 1991, Prime minister Nawaz Sharif established the programme under the direction of the Navy. On June 15, 1992, Pakistan became an Associate Member of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, but did not accede to the Antarctic Treaty due to economic reasons. 
In January 1991, Pakistan dispatched its first expedition to Greater Antarctica under the auspices of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO). As the programme was led by the Navy, the PN dispatched a small group of Pakistan Marines, along with the team of scientists on board the destroyer PNS Tariq and the research vessel PNS Behr Paima. Facilities were quickly established in the region, and Jinnah Antarctic Station (JNS) was commissioned. The station houses an unmanned automatic Weather Station, from which data are transmitted to Pakistan via Argos Satellite System. In 2001, the Badr-B was connected to the Weather Station after it was launched by SUPARCO. In 2006, Pakistan established the National Institute of Oceanography's Polar Research Cell (PRC). 
A number of national organisations are involved in Antarctic activities and are active participants in the Pakistan Antarctic Programme.
Both stations' data are transmitted to Pakistan via the Badr-B Satellite. However, the new Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite System was launched in late 2011 to replace the Badr satellite system program.
Objectives.
The main objectives of the Pakistan Antarctic Programme are to undertake multidisciplinary research and survey the Antarctic region, with particular attention to geology and geophysics. Studies also include environmental and oceanographic research. 
Pakistan's research activities are in conformity with the tenets of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), of which Pakistan is an associate member. Pakistanis have gained experience and capability by launching two major expeditions, thus strengthening Pakistan's ability to conduct research in the harsh Antarctic environment. Apart from this, useful environmental and oceanographic data has been collected in the region, and relevant technical information on Antarctic affairs has been provided to the Pakistani government.
Stations.
Pakistan maintains two summer research stations and one weather observatory in the vicinity of the Sør Rondane Mountains, Queen Maud Land, in Eastern Antarctica. The Jinnah Antarctic Station is the centre of most operations, and travel to and from Antarctica is done through the airfield at the JAS.
Pakistan is developing a full-fledged permanent base in Antarctica, which will allow researchers to carry out year-round operations.

Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde

The Verein für deutsche Schäferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs), commonly abbreviated SV, is the dog club founded by Max von Stephanitz in 1899 as the successor of the Phylax Society. The society set forward the standards of the breed and were responsible for the creation of the modern German Shepherd Dog.
History.
After the disestablishment of the Phylax Society in 1894, many members still harboured the desire to create a well-rounded dog by selectively breeding local German dog breeds. One such member was Max von Stephanitz, a cavalry officer and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College. Stephanitz harboured the belief that dogs should be bred for working purposes rather than for show.
On 22 April, 1899, while attending a dog show in Karlsruhe, Stephanitz showed his dog "Hektor Linksrhein" who competed under the kennel-name, “Horand von Grafrath”. On the sidelines of the dog show, Stephanitz, his colleague, Artur Meyer, and nine others founded the Verein für deutsche Schäferhunde. Stephanitz became the club's first president, and his dog, "Horand von Grafrath" (who had cost the then considerable price of 200 marks), became the first dog to be entered in the organization's breed registry. 
Pioneering the German Shepherd Dog.
In 1901, Stephanitz wrote a book titled Der deutsche Schäferhunde in Wort und Bild which was later expanded through a number of editions and translated into English under the title, The German Shepherd Dog in Word and Picture.
Overcoming old disputes.
Stephanitz believed strongly that a dog's working ability was of the utmost importance and aesthetics should be ignored. Thus, in order to avoid the arguments which lead to the disestablishment of the Phylax Society, the society's first breed standard, which Stephanitz wrote himself, said "A pleasing appearance is desirable, but it can not put the dog's working ability into question ... German Shepherd Dog breeding is working dog breeding, or it is not German Shepherd Dog breeding".
Present day.
The society is now the national German Shepherd Club of Germany and coordinates breeding, dog shows and titles.

The Super Spy

Super Spy (（ザ・スーパー・スパイ）) is an early Neo Geo game released by SNK in 1990. It is a first-person shooter and beat 'em up game with action RPG elements in which players move through the many floors of an office building shooting terrorists. It was an early example of a first-person shooter where the player character's arms and weapons are visible on screen. In 1991, SNK's "Crossed Swords" had similar gameplay, but with more RPG elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.
Plot.
The plot revolves around a C.I.A agent, named Roy Heart, who needs to traverse office buildings, and warehouses to stop a group of terrorists, known as the Zolge King terrorist group, led by a man name King (who bears a slight resemblance to Geese Howard in his business suit from the "Fatal Fury" and "The King of Fighters" franchises, both also by SNK). The group is responsible for the horrible murders of thousands caused by destroying the subways with bombs. As Mr. Heart, the player hunts through the terrorists' bomb factory for those responsible.
Gameplay.
The A button is for punches, and can be used to throw right hooks by pushing the stick diagonal-up either way and punch. A punch combination is done by tapping A repeatedly and a strong punch is done by holding down the A button then releasing it. 
B button is used for kicks and knee smashes. Players can also pistol-whip enemies, if the B button is pressed while armed with the pistol/machine gun.
Blocking is done by holding A and B correspondingly, right before the enemy attacks. Ducking is done by simply holding down. However if punch or kick is pressed while ducking, then an uppercut or a knee smash will be executed. Players can bob and weave, duck, and block, and sidestep enemies' attacks and deliver stronger blows. Alongside the martial arts expertise, the weapons of choice are a knife (which becomes rusty and dull with use), brass knuckles (which upgrades fists), a pistol, and an occasional machine gun.

Dave Simmons (footballer)

David John Simmons (24 October 1948 – 3 July 2007) was an English footballer who played for a number of Football League teams in the 1970s. He is perhaps best known for scoring the decisive goal in Colchester United's shock win against Leeds in the 1971 FA Cup.
Career.
A native of Ryde on the Isle of Wight, Simmons began his professional football career at Arsenal, but never played any first team competitive matches for the Gunners. Although a prolific goalscorer in the youth and reserve teams, he only played friendlies for the first team and spent a period of time out on loan at Bournemouth. In February 1969, he was transferred to Aston Villa, where he only played sporadically despite a good goal rate. In December 1970, he moved to Colchester. On 13 February 1971, Simmons scored one of the goals as the Fourth Division side won 3-2 against Don Revie's Leeds to qualify for the quarter-finals of the FA Cup.
In March 1973, Simmons moved to Cambridge United, and a year later he moved to Brentford, before returning for a second spell at Cambridge in November 1975. In total, Simmons played 184 league games, scoring 48 goals. He left Cambridge at the end of the 1975-76 season, and retired from the professional game due to injury. He later played for several non-league clubs in Cambridgeshire, including Cambridge City, Newmarket Town, Ely City and Soham Town Rangers.
Simmons died in July 2007, following a long battle with cancer, aged 58.

Latin Extended-B

Latin Extended-B is a block (0180-024F) of the Unicode Standard. It has been included since version 1.0, where it was only allocated to the code points U+0180..U+01FF and contained 113 characters. During unification with ISO 10646 for version 1.1, the block was expanded, and another 65 characters were added. In version 3.0, the last thirty available code points in the block were assigned.
Subheadings.
The Latin Extended-B block contains ten subheadings for groups of characters: Non-European and historic Latin, African letters for clicks, Croatian digraphs matching Serbian Cyrillic letters, Pinyin diacritic-vowel combinations, Phonetic and historic letters, Additions for Slovenian and Croatian, Additions for Romanian, Miscellaneous additions, Additions for Livonian, and Additions for Sinology. The Non-European and historic, African clicks, Croatian digraphs, Pinyin, and the first part of the Phonetic and historic letters were present in Unicode 1.0; additional Phonetic and historic letters were added for version 3.0; and other Phonetic and historic, as well as the rest of the sub-blocks were the characters added for version 1.1.
Non-European and historic Latin.
The Non-European and historic Latin subheading contains the first 64 characters of the block, and includes various variant letters for use in Zhuang, Americanist phonetic transcription, African languages, and other Latin script alphabets. It does not contain any standard letters with diacritics.
African letters for clicks.
The four African letters for clicks are used in Khoisan orthography.
Croatian digraphs matching Serbian Cyrillic letters.
The Croatian digraphs matching Serbian Cyrillic letters are three sets of three case mappings (lower case, upper case, and title case) of Latin digraphs used for compatibility with Cyrillic texts, the difference between the Croatian and Serbian languages largely being Latin vs. Cyrillic writing.
Pinyin diacritic-vowel combinations.
The 16 Pinyin diacritic-vowel combinations are used to represent the standard Mandarin Chinese vowel sounds with tone marks.
Phonetic and historic letters.
The 35 Phonetic and historic letters are largely various standard and variant Latin letters with diacritic marks.
Additions for Slovenian and Croatian.
The 24 Additions for Slovenian and Croatian are all standard Latin letters with unusual diacritics, like the double grave and inverted breve.
Additions for Romanian.
The Additions for Romanian are 4 characters that were erroneously unified as having a cedilla, when they have a comma below. The conflation of S and T with cedilla vs. comma below continues to plague Romanian language implementation up to the present.
Miscellaneous additions.
The Miscellaneous additions subheading contains 39 characters of various description and origin.
Additions for Livonian.
The Additions for Livonian are 10 letters with diacritics for writing the Livonian language.
Additions for Sinology.

1907 Punjab unrest

The 1907 Punjab unrests were period of unrest in the British Indian province of Punjab, principally around the Colonisation bill that was implemented in the province in 1906. This time line has often been called the beginning of the freedom movement in Punjab. Important leaders of this movement include Lala Lajpat Rai, Sardar Ajit Singh among others.
Colonisation Bill.
The colonisation bill was passed in the year 1906. This bill was passed after the passing of the Punjab Land Alienation act which had already caused a feeling of discontent among the Elite urban class. The colonisation bill provided for transfer of property of a person after his death to the government if he didn't have any heirs of his own and the Government could sell the property to any public or private developer.This was completely against the social conditions prevailing in the region and hence it was rejected by all the sides.
The Agitation.
The agitation against these measures of the Government was led by lala lajpat rai, he called for "extreme measures" . The first of the Protests was organised in the chenab colony, which was supposed to be the most affected by this bill. the 1st protest saw various organisations submitting memorials to the government to redress their grievances, but the government failed to pay any heed to these memos. This agitation was followed by a protest at Lyallpur. these agitations led to the formation of secret societies like "Anjuman-i- Muhibhan-i- Watan", the founder of which was Ajit Singh, a Jat Sikh who was believed to have the popular backing of lajpat rai. This period saw mass agitations which finally ended in the deportation of both Rai and Ajit singh.

<doc id="18696638" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18696638" title="Paroxysmal dyskinesia">
Paroxysmal dyskinesia

The paroxysmal dyskinesias (PD) are a group of movement disorders characterized by attacks of hyperkinesia with intact consciousness. Paroxysmal dyskinesia is a rare disorder, however the number of individuals it affects remains unclear. There are three different subtypes of PD that include paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, and paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia. Other neurological diseases have similar symptoms to PD, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's. The different subtypes make accurate and quick diagnosis of PD challenging. Thus, PD is often under reported and misdiagnosed, making it difficult to accurately study its prevalence in human populations. Onset of PD is usually in late childhood to early adolescence. New drug regimens help treat symptoms of PD, but no cure for the disorder is known.
Different Forms of Paroxysmal Dyskinesia.
The paroxysmal dyskinesias are mainly classified by their triggers and on the basis of the duration and frequency of the attacks. The three main types are paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) and paroxysmal exercise-induced (exertion-induced) dyskinesia (PED).
Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia (PKD).
This is characterized by attacks of involuntary movements (dystonia, chorea, or ballism), which are typically triggered by sudden voluntary movements, but can also be triggered by involuntary movements as well (for example, hyperventilating). These voluntary movements usually involve whole body activity such as standing, walking, and running. The age of onset is typically in childhood or early adolescence with most cases reporting improvement or complete remission with aging. Attacks last from seconds to minutes and are known to be at higher risk of occurring during stress, fear, cold, heat, or menstruation.
Paroxysmal Non-kinesogenic Dyskinesia (PNKD).
This is similar to PKD, characterizing as an episodic movement disorder, but is not triggered by voluntary movements. The attacks for PNKD are spontaneous and last from hours to days. It is an autosomal dominant disorder passing to nearly 50% of the offspring. Some predisposing factors include stress, excitement, alcoholic beverages, tea, and beverages with caffeine.
Paroxysmal Exercise-induced Dyskinesia (PED).
This is an extremely rare type of paroxysmal dyskinesia characterized by sudden, involuntary, dystonic movements, often including repetitive twisting motions and painful posturing. The attacks are triggered by exercise and other physical exertion, and usually last from minutes to an hour. Attacks usually appear in the body part that is being exercised or exerted over a period of time, perhaps 10 to 15 minutes.
Clinical Signs and Symptoms.
PKD.
The symptoms for PKD are varied from case to case, however, typically they consist of involuntary movements. Such contractile movements include dystonia, chorea, athetosis, and ballism. For example, “Her attacks were characterized as sudden unilateral stiffness of upper and lower limbs followed by an involuntary extrarotation of the arm and leg.” Another frequently occurring symptom is the presence of an aura before the attack. These sensations manifest in several forms, usually described as a tingling in the target limb.
A single limb is the most frequently affected area; however it is possible for an attack to affect more than one limb. When more than one limb is affected, the two limbs are usually unilateral (same side), even though cases of bilateral (opposite sides) symptoms have also been observed. Another frequently affected area is the torso, with some PKD patients twisting their body.
Attacks experienced by PKD patients typically last less than a minute, however longer attack can occur. To further distinguish between PKD and epilepsy, patients typically retain consciousness during their attacks, and are able to recall the attacks even after they have ended. Despite retaining consciousness, patients are usually incapable of speech during the attack. The frequency of attacks vary greatly. Some patients have been noted as having hundreds of attacks per day, while others go months without an attack.
PNKD.
The attacks consist of dystonia, chorea, and athetosis just like PKD. They are mostly of the limbs, and are usually unilateral or asymmetric. What sets PNKD apart from PKD is that the attacks can last anywhere from four minutes to four hours, but shorter and longer attacks have been reported as well.
The attacks also affect the limbs, usually unilaterally, but bilateral symptoms have also been experienced. PNKD patients usually report the presence of an aura before an attack as well; however they are usually different from those of PKD patients. Once again the aura varies, but is typically felt in the target limb. Another frequently noted aura is dizziness 
PNKD patients experience attacks that last much longer than those of PKD. These attacks vary in length and can last anywhere between four minutes and four hours. Similar to the difference between length of attacks, the intervals between attacks are much longer. The Interval between PNKD patients’ attacks is from one day to several months.
PED.
PED attacks are characterized in multiple ways. One distinguishing characteristic of PED patients is that they typically experience longer durations of dystonia during their attacks. The most frequent target of attacks are both legs bilaterally, rather than unilateral symptoms. The attacks have also been known to affect the upper half of the body as well. In some cases, patients have had attacks that affected the posturing of their neck and shoulder. Usually there is not an indicative aura symptom prior to a PED attack, which has to do with the nature of the onset of attacks.
The duration and frequency of PED attacks fall between those of PKD and PNKD. The attacks can be relieved with rest, typically taking about 10 minutes from cessation of the exercise. Attacks usually do not last longer than 30 minutes. Attacks typically occur at intervals of between a day and a month, however, there is a great deal of variability here. This variability can be contributed to the nature of the onset of attacks.
Causes/Pathology.
All PD associated subtypes have genetic contributions and are likely to run in a families genetic history due to dominant allele mutations. Mutations of identified genes have been leading areas of research in the study and treatment of paroxymal dyskinesia. PKD, PNKD, and PED are classified as separate subtypes because they all have different presentations of symptoms, but also, because they are believed to have different pathologies. 
Interestingly, studies on diseases that are similar in nature to PD have revealed insights into the causes of movement disorders. Hypnogenic paroxysmal dyskinesia is a form of epilepsy affecting the frontal lobe. Single genes have been identified on chromosomes 15, 20, and 21, which contribute to the pathology of these epilepsy disorders. Utilizing new knowledge about pathologies of related and similar disease can shed insight on the causal relationships in paroxysmal dyskinesia.
PKD.
Numerous causes have been proposed for PKD, such as genetic mutations, multiple sclerosis, brain trauma, and endocrine dysfunction. This is not an exhaustive list; many other causes are being proposed and studied. Until causal genes can be identified, the pathology of PKD will not be fully understood. Researchers have identified specific loci in chromosomes 16 and 22, which have been reported to have a genotype-phenotype correlation.
PNKD.
Research on the pathology for PNKD suggests that mutations to specific nucleotide sequences in chromosome 2, MR-1 (myofibrililogenesis regulator - 1) may be linked to PNKD. Studies on MR-1 reveal that it serves as a detoxifying agent. PNKD is sometimes induced by the consumption of alcohol or coffee. Individuals with a mutation in the MR-1 gene sequence may have problems detoxifying the body when alcohol or caffeine is ingested, perhaps resulting in the onset of PNKD. 
Other studies have revealed a possible mutation on the calcium sensitive potassium (BK) channel. A mutation affecting the influx and efflux of potassium and calcium can cause large scale changes in a neuron. This specific mutation leads to increased excitability of the neuron, often inducing rapid depolarization eliciting numerous action potentials.
The pathogenesis of PKND is partially defined by the identification of mutations in the myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR-1), whose gene product is an enzyme involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal (a compound present in coffee, cola, and alcoholic beverages).
PED.
Long periods of continuous physical exercise is often considered the causal factor involved in a PED diagnosis. It is important to note that PED a is sometimes co-diagnosed with epilepsy and young-onset Parkinson's disease. Correlations between the causes of young-onset Parkinson's disease and PED may be due to a similar problem, specifically a mutation of a potassium channel gene on chromosome 1.
The pathogenesis of PED has also been linked to mutations in the GLUT1 glucose transporter which can result in transient energy deficits in the basal ganglia.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis is similar, but slightly different for each type of PD. Some types are more understood than others, and therefore have more criteria for diagnosis.
PKD.
The guidelines for diagnosing PKD were reviewed and confirmed by Unterberger and Trinka. PKD consists of unexpected forms of involuntary movements of the body. The patient is usually diagnosed sometime before their 20's, and is more likely diagnosed during childhood than early adulthood. Almost all PKD's are idiopathic, but there have been examples of autosomal dominant inheritance as well. Physical examination and brain imaging examinations show normal results, and an EEG shows no specific abnormalities as well. However, the negative synchronous EEG results can be used to prove that PKD is not a sort of reflex epilepsy, but a different disease.
PKD is the most prevalent subtype of paroxysmal dyskinesia, encompasing over 80% of all given PD diagnosis. PKD is more prevalent in boys, usually as high as 3.75:1. 
PNKD.
PNKD has a set guideline for diagnosis that is slightly different from PKD. PNKD usually occurs unexpectedly, and is not brought on by sudden movements or exercise. Instead the attacks are brought on by stresses such as emotional stress, fatigue, alcohol, or caffeine consumption. Just like PKD, PNKD also shows autosomal dominance in family history. Physical examination and brain imaging examinations show normal results, and EEG shows no specific abnormalities as well.
PNKD is more prevalent in boys, with ratios of 1.4:1. 
PED.
PED has a set guideline for diagnosis that is similar, but slightly different from both PKD and PNKD. PED attacks consist of dystonic and bilateral movements usually in the lower limbs of the body. These attacks are usually brought about only by exercise and physical exhaustion. PED patients do not feel an aura-like sensation before an attack occurs, unlike PKD and PNKD. These attacks usually last from 5 to 30 minutes, and can occur once a day or once a month. Physical examination and brain imaging examinations show normal results, and EEG shows no specific abnormalities as well.
PED is the rarest paraoxysmal dyskinesia subtype.
Prognosis.
Paroxysmal Dyskinesia is not a fatal disease. Life can be extremely difficult with this disease depending on the severity. The prognosis of PD is extremely difficult to determine because the disease varies from person to person. The attacks for PKD can be reduced and managed with proper anticonvulsants, but there is no particular end in sight for any of the PD diseases. PKD has been described to cease for some patients after the age of 20, and two patients have reported to have a family history of the disease where PKD went into complete remission after the age of 23. With PNKD and PED, at this time, there is no proper way to determine an accurate prognosis.
Management.
PKD.
PKD patients usually show a good response to anticonvulsants. Most commonly used medications are sodium blockers, carbamazepine and phenytoin. During a drug-testing study, patients reported a decreasing response to the latter use of anticonvulsants and switched to carbamazepine or phenytoin. Refraining from established triggers such as sudden movement has been shown to lessen attacks occurrences. Avoidance of predisposing factors such as stress, excitement, and fatigue also help manage attacks.
PNKD.
Treatment for PKND is more difficult than other Paroxysmal Dyskinesias. The majority of patients experience some relief from low dosages of clonazepam, a muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant. Similar to PKD, avoidance of stress, excitement, and fatigue will lower the frequency of PNKD attacks. Many patients also avoid known methyglyoxal containing foods and beverages such as alcohol, coffee, tea, and chocolate.
PED.
PED patients usually avoid prolonged, continuous exertion to prevent occurrence of attacks. Use of anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines show little to no success in PED patients. A few cases have shown that patients were able to lessen their attacks with a high carbohydrate snack. A new approach to managing PED is the ketogenic diet, which alters the primary cerebral energy metabolism from glucose to ketone bodies. Reports have shown that the ketonic diet protects against seizures in epilepsy. In PED, it is probable that ketones will provide sufficient energy for the basal ganglia, which is normally deficient in patients with PED.

Southerness is a small coastal village in the Dumfries and Galloway. Southerness is located approximately south of the A710 between Caulkerbush and Kirkbean. The town today is mainly a tourist village and has for many years had a large number of static caravans, some private and many rented to holiday makers. The local bus services to and from Dalbeatie and Dumfries also reflect in their timetables the differences between summer and the off seasons with a vastly reduced service. 
One of the main landmarks is its lighthouse which was built in 1749 and is one of the oldest lighthouses in Scotland. The lighthouse stands approximately 17 metres tall and was decommissioned in the 1930s. One of the two golf courses was redesigned in 1947 by course manager Mackenzie Ross.
The village has to the north a magnificent backdrop of the marilyn Criffel and to the south the sandy bay of Gillfoot and stunning views on a clear day across the Solway Firth to the Lakeland Hills and Fells.

Sir Job Charlton, 1st Baronet

Sir Job Charlton, 1st Baronet KS (ca. 1614 – 26 May 1697) was an English judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1659 and 1679. He was Speaker of the House of Commons of England briefly in 1673. 
Life.
Charlton was born in London, the only surviving son of Robert Charlton, Fishmonger, of Mincing Lane, London and Whitton Court, Shropshire and his first wife Emma Harby, daughter of Thomas Harby of Adstone, Northamptonshire. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford on 20 April 1632, aged 17. He was a student of Lincoln's Inn in 1633 and was called to the bar in 1640. 
In 1659, Charlton was elected Member of Parliament for Ludlow in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was elected MP for Ludlow again in 1660 for the Convention Parliament. He was a justice on the Oxford circuit in July 1660 and was created serjeant-at-law in October 1660. In 1661, he was re-elected MP for Ludlow for the Cavalier Parliament. He served as a justice on the Chester circuit from 1661 to 1662. He was made a King's Serjeant in 1668.
Charlton served as Speaker from 4 to 18 February 1673, pleading ill-health to retire. 
He left Parliament in 1679, and was forced out of the post of Chief Justice of Chester in 1680 when Judge Jeffreys desired it, being placed in the Court of Common Pleas instead.
In lieu of that office Charlton was, 26 April 1680, made chief justice of the common pleas ; but having given his opinion in opposition to the king's dispensing power, he was removed from office 26 April 1680. 
He was, however, restored to the chief justiceship of Chester, and on 12 May was created a baronet. 
He died at his seat at Ludford, Herefordshire, 29 May 1697. 
Family.
By his first wife, Dorothy, daughter and heiress of William Blundell of Bishop's Castle, he had four sons and three daughters, and by his second wife, Lettice, daughter of Walter Waring of Oldbury, he had one son and one daughter. 
The baronetcy became extinct with the fourth holder in 1784.

Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis

Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreathetosis (PKC) also called Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia (PKD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, which are triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person’s 20's to 30's. Involuntary movements can take many forms such as ballism, chorea or dystonia and usually only affect one side of the body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of paroxysmal dyskinesias and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen. Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central nervous system trauma, or peripheral nervous system trauma. PKD has also been linked with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrme, in which patients have afebrile seizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life. This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.
History of Discovery.
A movement disorder similar to PKD was first mentioned in research literature in 1940 by Mount and Reback. They described a disorder consisting of attacks of involuntary movements but unlike PKD, the attacks lasted minutes to hours and were found to be caused by alcohol or caffeine intake. They named it paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis. Kertesz later described another new movement disorder in 1967. He described a disorder that was induced by sudden movements, and responded to anticonvulsants, naming it paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. Finally in a review in 1995 Demirkiran and Jankovic stated the disease should be called paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia instead, pointing out that the attacks could manifest as any form of dyskinesia, not just choreoathetosis.
Diagnosis.
Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is diagnosed using a strict set of guidelines. These criteria were studied and confirmed by Bruno et al. in a study of 121 individuals with PKD. The age at onset is between 1 and 20 years old. The attacks of involuntary movements last less than one minute and have a known trigger, usually a sudden voluntary movement. For example, if a PKD patient stands up or begins walking after being sedentary for a period of time, or a person goes from a walk to a run, it can trigger an attack. Persons with PKD do not lose consciousness during attacks and have a full memory of the entire attack. Lastly, people with the disorder have a good response to medication and are usually prescribed anticonvulsants. The study also found that patients with familial PKD exhibit symptoms that follow the diagnostic criteria closely, while sporadic PKD individuals may deviate slightly. Prior to criteria for diagnosis being set out, many patients with PKD were often diagnosed with some form of epilepsy. Unlike epilepsy, patients with PKD do not lose consciousness during attacks. In addition, individuals with PKD generally have normal postictal neurologic exams. However, many patients also experience an aura, similar to those experienced with epilepsy, preceding their attacks. Some patients describe it as a tingling sensation in the affected limb or “butterflies in their stomach.” Some individuals also have precipitants, such as stress and anxiety that make it more likely for attacks to occur. 
The above diagnostic criteria also set PKD apart from the other paroxysmal dyskinesias, which include paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) and paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED). While PKD attacks last less than one minute, PNKD attacks last a few minutes to a few hours, and as the name suggests, the attacks do not occur because of a sudden voluntary movement like PKD. Additionally, PKD can almost always be managed with drug therapy, while PNKD is not as responsive to anticonvulsants. PED, on the other hand, separates itself from PKD in that it is caused by prolonged exercise. Attacks from PED will cease soon after exercise is stopped.
Treatment.
Almost all patients respond positively to antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) drugs. One of the drugs most often mentioned in the literature is carbamazepine, and is the most widely used drug for treating PKD. Other anticonvulsants like valproic acid, phenytoin and clonazepam are common alternatives. Other categories of drugs have also been used, such as dopamine affecting drugs like Levodopa or Tetrabenazine. Individuals with the disorder can also modify their behavior to lessen their attacks without the influence of drug therapy. For example, decreasing stress to avoid precipitants can help patients decrease the number of attacks. In addition, avoiding any sudden movements can also prevent an attack. In order to prevent an attack, some individuals use their auras as a warning, while others purposefully perform slow gestures or movements prior to a triggering movement. Many, if not most, individuals end up growing out of the attacks with age, even without medicinal therapy, but some patients will go back to having attacks after a period of remission. In regards to secondary PKD, treatment of the primary condition can lessen the PKD attacks in those individuals.
Pathophysiology.
Currently the pathophysiology of PKD is not fully explained. A few mechanisms have been suggested thus far:
Multiple methods are being used to study the potential brain abnormalities of individuals with PKD compared with “normal” individuals. These methods include SPECT studies, fMRI studies, and diffusion tensor imaging. The main problem with many of the studies concerned with the pathophysiology of the disorder is the small sample size. Because the studies normally only include about 7-10 patients with PKD, the results cannot be generalized to the entire population of patients. However, the studies do bring up possibilities for further study.
SPECT Studies.
In a study by Joo et al., the researchers performed interictal studies, meaning they scanned the patient's brain between attacks to find an underlying abnormality, rather than ictal scans, which look at the abnormalities that present themselves during an attack. The researchers found interictally decreased cerebral blood flow in the posterior parts of the bilateral caudate nucleus. However, the literature does state that although this could be a cause of PKD, it could also be a result of PKD. Another SPECT study showed an increase in the cerebral blood flow in the left posterior thalamus in a PKD patient during an attack. The researchers also subtracted the ictal from the postictal scans, and saw increased blood flow in the thalamus. They ultimately suggested that hyperactive blood flow in this area could be causing the pathophysiology of PKD. This study, however, was only performed on one patient, and would need to be replicated many more times in order to be generalized to the population of PKD patients. Other SPECT studies have been cited showing hyperactivity in the basal ganglia.
fMRI Studies.
In a study by Zhou et al., the researchers performed fMRI studies on PKD patients, and analyzed the differences between the amplitude low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the patients. They found that the left postcentral gyrus and the bilateral putamen had increased ALFF in PKD patients. The researchers concluded that the hyperactivity in these regions suggested that there is a dysfunction in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit in PKD. This circuit is part of the motor control circuit in the brain, making it a reasonable place for abnormality in a movement disorder, but again, researchers are still unsure of the role these differences they found play in the disease pathology.
Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) displays physical alterations in the brain that may not be seen on regular MRI. In one study researchers found that some of the patients had abnormalities in their thalamus. However, this does not prove that all patients have abnormalities in their thalamus. Other cases are cited, including a patient who developed a similar paroxysmal dyskinesia after a thalamic infarction, implicating that an abnormality in the thalamus of individuals could contribute to PKD. It is not fully known, however, what role a thalamic abnormality plays in the disease pathophysiology.
Genetics of Disease.
Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia has been shown to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. In 2011, the PRRT2 gene on chromosome 16 was identified as the cause of the disease. The researchers looked at the genetics of eight families with strong histories of PKD. They employed whole genome sequencing, along with Sanger sequencing to identify the gene that was mutated in these families. The mutations in this gene included a nonsense mutation identified in the genome of one family and an insertion mutation identified in the genome of another family. The researchers then confirmed this gene as the cause of PKD when it was not mutated in the genome of 1000 control patients. Researchers found PRRT2 mutations in 10 of 29 sporadic cases affected with PKC, thus suggests PRRT2 is the gene mutated in a subset of PKC and PKC is genetically heterogeneous. The mechanism of how PRRT2 causes PKD still requires further investigation. However, researchers suggest it may have to do with PRRT2's expression in the basal ganglia, and the expression of an associated protein, SNAP25, in the basal ganglia as well.

Paroxysmal exercise-induced dystonia

Paroxysmal exercise-induced dystonia or PED is a rare neurological disorder characterized by sudden, transient, involuntary movements, often including repetitive twisting motions and painful posturing triggered by exercise or other physical exertion. PED is in the class of paroxysmal dyskinesia which are a group of rare movement disorders characterized by attacks of hyperkinesia with intact consciousness. The term paroxysmal indicates that the episodes are sudden and short lived and usually unpredicted, and return to normal is rapid. The number of reported cases of people with PED is very small leading to difficulty in studying and classifying this disease and most studies are limited to a very small number of test subjects.
Symptoms.
Episodes are relatively short-lived, lasting anywhere from 5–30 minutes, and in most cases disappear completely after cessation of the physical exercise. Most patients will experience 1 to 5 episodes per month, but some can have attacks daily. The muscles most often affected are usually in the legs and feet (75% of reported cases), but the upper body muscles such as the arms, face, neck, and trunk have also been observed to be affected during the episodes of dystonia. Age of onset is usually sometime in childhood, but can range from 1–30 years old. In one study it was found that the mean age of onset was around 8 years. Similarly in the study, the legs were the most common affected part of the body and the attacks were reported as stiffening and cramps by those affected.During an episode of PED patients find walking nearly impossible.Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a two-fold increase of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid immediately following exercise compared to normal levels. This indicated that increased dopaminergic transmission could contribute to PED and other paroxysmal dyskinesias. Neurological examinations, EEG, and brain imaging are all normal in PED patients.
Causes.
Familial.
In most cases, PED is familial, but can also be sporadic. In familial cases, pedigrees examined have shown PED to be an autosomal-dominant inheritance trait. PED also has been associated with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and migraines, although the exact relationship between these is unknown. 
A suspected contributor to familial PED is a mutation in the GLUT1 gene, SLC2A1, which codes for the transporter GLUT1, a protein responsible for glucose entry across the blood–brain barrier. It is not thought that the mutation causes a complete loss of function of the protein but rather only slightly reduces the transporter's activity. In a study of PED patients, a median CSF/blood glucose ratio of .52 compared to a normal .60 was found. In addition, reduced glucose uptake by mutated transporters compared with wild-type in Xenopus oocytes confirmed a pathogenic role of these mutations.
Another recent study was performed to continue to look at the possible connection between PED and mutations on the SLC2A1 gene which codes for the GLUT1 transporter. While PED can occur in isolation it was also noted that it occurs in association with epilepsy as well. In this study the genetics of a five-generation family with history of PED and epilepsy were evaluated. From the results it was noted that most of the mutations were due to frameshift and missense mutations. When looking at homologous GLUT1 transporters in other species it was noted that serine (position 95), valine (position 140), and asparagine (position 317) were highly conserved and therefore mutations in these residues would most likely be pathogenic. Therefore these are areas of interest when looking at what could lead to PED.All mutations that were observed appeared to only affect the ability of GLUT1 to transport glucose and not the ability for it to be inserted in the membrane. The observed maximum transport velocity of glucose was reduced anywhere from 3 to 10 fold.
A study was performed to determine if the mutation known for the PNKD locus on chromosome 2q33-35 was the cause of PED. In addition, other loci were observed such as the familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) locus on chromosome 19p, or the familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA). All three of these suspected regions were found to not contain any mutations, and were therefore ruled out as possible candidates for a cause of PED.
Sporadic.
Sporadic cases may be brought on by minor head injuries and concussions. This was observed in one patient who started experiencing painless dystonia after mild exercise following a concussion. More research still needs to be done to determine how injuries can induce PED, as little is known in this area. Two cases of PED have been associated with insulinomas, after removal of which the symptoms of PED were resolved.
Diagnosis.
Since the age of onset is relatively young of PED it is important to correctly diagnose this disease. The limited cases and limited knowledge of the disease makes this difficult but a few characteristics seem to be consistent. It appears that patients with PED would have normal neurological examinations and MRI but the noticeable characteristic would be in low levels of glucose in the cerebral spinal fluid due to the GLUT1 mutations.
Reported Cases.
There are very few reported cases of PED, there are approximately 20 reported sporadic cases of PED and 9 PED families but there is some dispute on the exact number of cases. In addition it appears that PED becomes less severe with aging. Prior to onset of a PED episode some patients reported onset of symptoms including sweating, pallor, and hyperventilation. In brain scans it was observed that patients suffering form frequent PEDs there was increased metabolism in the putamen of the brain and decreased metabolism in the frontal lobe. Another study using subtraction single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging technique which was coregistered with an MRI on a patient presented with PED symptoms showed increased cerebral perfusion in the primary somatosensory cortex area, and a mild increase in the region of the primary motor cortex and cerebellum. While all these correlations are not fully understand as to what exactly is happening in the brain it provides areas of interest to study further to hopefully understand PED more fully.
Related Disorders.
PED differs from two closely related disorders, for example paroxysmal kinesogenic dyskinesia (PKD) and paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), based on what brings on the symptoms, namely prolonged exercise, such as brisk walking or running for at least 10 minutes. This is in contrast to PKD where the symptoms are brought about by sudden movements, and PNKD where the symptoms are spontaneous in nature and prolonged. PED is usually affects muscles on both sides of the body (bilateral), it has also been observed to have unilateral effects.
PED has also been shown to be a precursor to Parkinson's Disease. In two observed cases, PED preceded any symptoms of Parkinson's Disease by 1.5 and 5 years. Although a rare indicator, PED can be an early sign of the disorder, suggesting they are related. In one case a patient with PED showed evidence of dopamine depletion revealed by a dopamine transporter SPECT scan. This is typical of Parkinson's Disease, further showing the linkage between the diseases.
A correlation between Epilepsy and PED has been observed in several families across multiple generations, demonstrating an autosomal dominant inheritability of symptoms. The occurrence of coexistent seizures and PED symptoms are observed mainly during infancy and childhood, with symptoms of PED continuing throughout a lifetime. Epileptic seizures vary in type and have been observed as absence and generalized seizures. Simultaneous seizure and PED attacks are often premeditated by bouts of dizziness. Attacks have been shown to be reduced or prevented with food ingestion, although the reasons for this are unclear. Various evidence shows that the disorders are likely caused by dysfunction in voltage-gated ion channels, which may lead to abnormal excitability in different brain regions, specifically the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia.
Treatments.
As there appeared to be a connection with PED and mutated GLUT1 transporters a possible treatment was looking at changing patients diets. A common treatment for another disorder with a mutated GLUT1 transporter is the ketogenic diet. The diet is a strict 3:1 ratio of fat (3) to protein and carbohydrates (1). This diet is thought to help restore the unbalance created by the decreased amount of glucose in the brain caused by the faulty GLUT1 transporter. This diet was administered to three patients who had been screened and found to have mutation in their SLC2A genes coding for GLUT1 and were experiencing PED symptoms. All three showed benefit from this treatment and a reduction in their PED episodes. They were able to exercise and run long distances for the first time in their lives. No other studies have been performed using this diet as many patients feel the advantages of the diet do not outweigh its disadvantages.
As some cases have noted that patients were able to alleviate or lessen there PED attacks with a sugary snack, another diet that was tried on patients was one rich in carbohydrates with additional frequent carbohydrate-containing snacks. Four patients with reported PED symptoms were put on this diet but no observable improvements were noted and in fact one patient even complained of worsening symptoms.
Additionally it has been observed that levodopa may reduce some symptoms associated with PED. This may demonstrate that PED is a precursor to Parkinson's disease. Acetazolamide was beneficial to some patients, but also worsened symptoms in others. Additionally, a modified version of the Atkin's Diet helped to regulate glucose levels in the CSF. Patients with PED associated with insulinomas appeared to have symptoms resolved after consuming sugary drinks. Currently, there are no drugs that are particularly useful in completely curing all symptoms.
Current Situation.
Since paroxysmal exercise-induced dystonia is such a rare disorder it makes it difficult to study the disease and find consistencies. Many of the current studies seem to have contradicting conclusion but this is due to the fact that studies are usually limited to a very small number of test subjects. With such small numbers it is hard to determine what is a trend and what is random when in comes to characterizing the disease. Further study is needed to find better diagnostic techniques and treatments for PED. Patients with PED are living a limited lifestyle since simple tasks like walking and exercise are often impossible.

Stellation diagram

In geometry, a stellation diagram or stellation pattern is a two-dimensional diagram in the plane of some face of a polyhedron, showing lines where other face planes intersect with this one. The lines cause 2D space to be divided up into regions. Regions not intersected by any further lines are called elementary regions. Usually infinite regions are excluded from the diagram, along with any infinite portions of the lines. Each elementary region represents a top face of one cell, and a bottom face of another.
A collection of these diagrams, one for each face type, can be used to represent any stellation of the polyhedron, by shading the regions which should appear in that stellation.
A stellation diagram exists for every face of a given polyhedron. In face transitive polyhedra, symmetry can be used to require all faces have the same diagram shading. Semiregular polyhedra like the Archimedean solids will have different stellation diagrams for different kinds of faces.

He specializes in the floor exercise, in which he won several medals at world and European championships, and reached the final at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2013, Shatilov won a gold medal at the European championship in gymnastics in Moscow, Russia.
Biography.
Alexander (Alex) Shatilov was born in in Uzbekistan. He began his gymnastics training in Uzbekistan at the age of five. He immigrated to Israel in 2002. 
He is unusually tall for a gymnast, at 183 cm or 6 ft.
Athletic career.
Shatilov placed seventh at the 2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships and became the first Israeli gymnast in a world apparatus final. He won fifth place at the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. He also won a gold medal in the Glasgow world cup in 2008.
Shatilov represented Israel at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the qualifying stage, he placed 8th on the floor apparatus and qualified to the final. He also placed 29th overall, and just missed the cut for the all-around final.
In the floor final he failed to improve his ranking and placed last of the 8 finalists, which was still the best ever achievement in artistic gymnastics for an Israeli gymnast.
He won bronze medals in the floor exercise at the 2009 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships and the 2009 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, and became the first Israeli to win a medal at both events.
He suffered a serious knee injury in spring 2010 and missed the European championships, but recovered in time to place fourth at the 2010 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.
In 2011, he won the silver medal in the floor exercise at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships.
At the 2011 World Championships he won the bronze medal in the floor exercise, and also finished 13th in the all-around final. 
His achievement qualified him to compete for Israel at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Shatilov tied for 4th on floor and placed 12th overall, qualifying for the finals in both events. In the men's floor final, Shatilov got the score 15.333,and tied with the American Jacob Dalton, but was placed beneath him because Dalton's execution points were higher. In the end, Shatilov was sixth place out of eight athletes.
In April 2013, Shatilov won a gold medal at the European championship in gymnastics in Moscow, Russia. He received a 15.333 score and shared first place with the British gymnast Max Whitlock. Shatilov is the first Israeli to win the European championship.
Shatilov was awarded the title of Athlete of the Year in Israel in 2009 and 2013.

P.W. &amp; B. Railroad Bridge

The P.W. & B. Railroad Bridge was the first bridge over the Susquehanna River built by the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad in 1866 as part of the first mainline railroad between Philadelphia and Baltimore. The bridge was replaced by the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge in 1906.
History.
The PW&B began operating its main line in 1838, using a ferry operation to transport railroad cars over the Susquehanna.
Construction of the bridge, a wood truss design, began in 1862. The masonry and most of the wooden spans were complete in 1866, but then a tornado severely damaged the wooden components on July 25, 1866. Repairs were made quickly and the first locomotive crossed the bridge on November 20, 1866. The cost of construction, including rebuilding most of the truss portions, was $2.3 million. Passenger trains began service over the bridge on November 26, 1866.
The PW&B later replaced the wooden spans with iron spans. A draw span was installed in the late 1870s.
The Pennsylvania Railroad took control of the PW&B in 1881. It built a new bridge during 1904 to 1906.
The piers from the PW&B bridge still stand next to the current bridge.

Nevins Farm and Equine Center

Nevins Farm and Equine Center, also known as MSPCA at Nevins Farm and the Methuen Animal Care and Adoption Center at Nevins Farm, is an animal shelter and veterinary hospital in Methuen, Massachusetts operated by the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Part of the property is devoted to Hillside Acre Animal Cemetery, a animal cemetery.
Nevins Farm "never turns away an animal in need" and is the only open-door horse and farm animal rescue center in New England. According to the MSPCA, the center's "equine, farm animal, and small animal surrender, adoption, and foster care services are unique in the Northeast". Located north of Boston on a rural swath of land between Interstate 93 and Massachusetts Route 28, each year the center serves about 7,000 animals and is visited by approximately 75,000 people. The farm primarily serves the Merrimack Valley and southern New Hampshire but some of its services, such as the Equine Ambulance Program described below, are international.
History.
In 1917, Mrs. Harriet Nevins donated her farm of rolling pastures in Methuen to the MSPCA so that it could be used as a rest home for horses and other unwanted or abandoned animals. The donation was accompanied by a $5,000 bequest toward building construction and the purchase of necessary farm implements and machinery. First known as "The Rest Home", the property was used for retired police horses and other horses who worked on the then-cobblestone streets of Boston. Arrangements made with horse owners allowed horses that were still working animals to spend time grazing and relaxing in the fields of Nevins Farm. A common agreement was one in which a horses would rotate between spending a month on the farm and a month in Boston working.
A shelter for small animals was added to the Methuen facility in 1924 and as motor vehicles replaced horse-drawn carriages and fewer horses worked on the streets, the role of the farm began to change. While involvement with smaller animals has increased, Nevins Farm's concern for large animals has remained a central part of its mission. In 1994, the farm launched the Equine Ambulance Program to offer emergency rescue and transport of disabled horses in New England and ambulance services events involving horses worldwide.
George and Connie Noble of Concord, Massachusetts donated the funds for Nevins Farm's adoption center building that opened in 2004. The new facility is officially known as the Noble Family Animal Care and Adoption Center at Nevins Farm.
Adoption.
, finding suitable people to adopt animals is primary focus of the farm. Animals available for adoption at Nevins Farm include both typical household pets such as cats, dogs, ferrets, gerbils, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, parakeets and other small birds, rabbits, rats, and turtles as well as farm animals like chickens, cows, ducks, geese, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep. More unusual animals are sometimes available as well as was the case when the farm acquired a barnyard full new animals that included miniature horses and Nigerian Dwarf Goats from a farm in Southwick, Massachusetts.
According to the MSPCA:
Cocker Spaniels to Siamese Cats to Thoroughbreds to Pygmy Goats...Shelters take in many homeless purebreds, as well as mixed breeds, and the MSPCA at Nevins Farm works with other humane societies and rescue groups to help find them loving, permanent homes. If you are looking for a purebred companion, you may find one right here.
It is more difficult to find homes for larger animals and according to one employee "They tend to stay a little longer at the farm animal shelter...It depends when the right person comes around." 
Summer is the busiest time of year at the Nevins Farm. According to Stephen Zawistowski, an executive vice president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (a non-profit organization without formal connections to the MSPCA), "It's cat season...Cats tend to reproduce based on, essentially, the solar cycle...The weather's good. They're more likely to survive. This is particularly true in the Northeast." Zawistowski endorsed the MSPCA staff at Nevins Farm as being able to handle the overload while compromising neither the animals' health nor their safety.
Events.
Among the fundraising and other events held at or benefiting Nevins Farm are the following:
Cemetery.
The Hillside Acre Animal Cemetery is a pet cemetery that occupies four acres (1.6 ha) of landscaped terrain. The cemetery serves as the resting place of over 18,000 "beloved animal companions" as well as a number of military dogs.
The cemetery offers animals allows patrons to erect marble or granite tombstones for their deceased animals after burial and provides perpetual care for each grave. Each patron is given a key to the locked iron fence surrounding the graveyard. Cremation services are also available allowing patrons to choose 
between interring their pets' ashes in a grave, taking them home in a sealed urn, or having them scattered. Staff also serves as a resource for who seek the help of support groups to help them deal with the loss of their pets.

Glass Eye (band)

Glass Eye were an influential art rock group based in Austin, Texas, and were primarily active from 1983 to 1993. Popular in Austin, and on the college radio and tour circuit, the band's unusual and unique musical style, blending melodic hooks with dissonance and occasional tendencies for the avant-garde, delighted critics. Their commercial success never matched their critical acclaim. Through self-release, and being signed to Wrestler and Bar/None Records, they released four LPs, two EPs and one single, and when the band regrouped in 2006, they released their previously lost final LP, "Every Woman's Fantasy", on their own label, Glass Eye Records.
History.
Glass Eye formed in 1983, and became regulars in the Texas music circuit, that was booming at the time. An episode of the MTV show "Cutting Edge" from 1985 featured Glass Eye (and other bands like the The Reivers (band), Timbuk 3, and the seminal singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston) as examples of the so-called "New Sincerity" musical movement. Johnston played his first public performance opening for Glass Eye. He had given his self-recorded tape, Hi, How Are You to Glass Eye frontwoman Kathy McCarty, who didn't listen to it until after Johnston asked her what she thought of the record (she reportedly praised it, then went home and listened to it immediately afterwards). McCarty and Johnston later dated briefly; their relationship is documented in the 2006 Jeff Feuerzeig film, The Devil and Daniel Johnston. 
The original line-up of Glass Eye consisted of the following:
This lineup was featured on their first two records, "Marlo" (1985) and "Huge" (1986). In 1987 Marcus and Weir left the band. Sheri Lane played keyboards and guitar and Dave Cameron, now Lisa Cameron following a sex change, played drums on the 1988 album "Bent By Nature." Marcus and Weir rejoined the band in 1989 and the band released "Hello Young Lovers" that year and the "Satellite of Love/Rock of Hand" single in 1991. 
Glass Eye's albums were produced primarily by Beattie and engineered by various contributors, including Mike Stewart, Stuart Sullivan, and Roy Taylor. Beattie had previously played bass in several bands including the Stamford, Ct. based punk bands Tapeworm (punk band) and Safety Patrol (band), as well as the initial line-up of the Californian punk band Fang (band). McCarty played with the Austin all-woman band "Buffalo Gals" as well as a Berkeley, California based band Sinequan with former Safety Patrol member Scott Fletcher before joining Glass Eye. Scott Marcus also was in Safety Patrol. Marcus, Stella Weir and Kathy McCarty all had cameo roles in the 1991 Richard Linklater film, Slacker (film), and the Glass Eye song, "White Walls" featured on the film's soundtrack.
Breakup and Solo Careers.
The band broke up in 1993 following some friction relating their attempts at signing to a major label. Kathy McCarty went on to make several solo records, including the acclaimed "Dead Dog's Eyeball", a cover album of Daniel Johnston songs, and its subsequent EP, "Sorry Entertainer". In 2005, she released her own record of original songs called "Another Day In The Sun". In 1987, Stella Weir and Scott Marcus played in the band Prohibition for one album, "Flophouse." Marcus has also played with The Asylum Street Spankers and Starfish. Brian Beattie has continued his career as a record producer, working with The Dead Milkmen, Ed Hall (band), Daniel Johnston, and Okkervil River among others. The band reformed briefly in 2006 to celebrate the release of their final album, "Every Woman's Fantasy." They played several shows, including at SXSW, to publicize the album.

Dr5 chrome

dr5, or dr5 Chrome, is a reversal black-and-white process, via which most kinds of black-and-white negative films produce transparencies (slides). It was developed by David Wood, CEO and proprietor of dr5 Chrome Lab, a photographer turned photographic chemist. The dr5 process is a chemical reversal process, rather than the standard light-based reversal for B&W transparency (black and white slide]. David Wood recently contributed to the acclaimed Darkroom Cookbook.
History.
The dr5 process, the 5th incarnation of the process and was arrived at by experimentation. Though reversal film processing is commonly known, the dr5 process is proprietary by trade secret. Done privately until 1998, the process teamed shortly with A&I labs in Los Angeles CA. The dr5 process won best new product in 1999 at the '99 Photo Expo-Plus Expo Review In 2001, dr5 opened an independent lab at 38th and 8th in New York City.

Fagundes Varela

Luís Nicolau Fagundes Varela (August 17, 1841 – February 18, 1875) was a Brazilian Romantic poet, adept of the "Ultra-Romanticism" movement. He is patron of the 11th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.
Biography.
Luís Nicolau Fagundes Varela was born in Rio Claro in 1841, to Emiliano Fagundes Varela and Emília de Andrade. He spent most of his childhood at the farm where he was born, later moving to innumerous places, among them the city of Catalão, Goiás, where he met Bernardo Guimarães. Returning to Rio, he lived in Angra dos Reis and Petrópolis, where he concluded his primary and secondary studies. In 1859, he goes to São Paulo and, in 1862, enters at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo, but abandons it to dedicate himself to the literature and to the bohemianism. He published his first poetry book, "Noturnas", one year before.
He married a circus artist from Sorocaba, Alice Guilhermina Luande. This provoked a scandal in his family and made his financial condition worse. With her he had a son, Emiliano, who died with 3 months old; extremely depressed, Fagundes wrote in the memory of his dead son his most well-known poem, "Cântico do Calvário" (that can be found on the book "Cantos e Fantasias"). His woman died in 1865 or 1866, while Varela was travelling to Recife. Returning to São Paulo, he matriculated himself once more in the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo in 1867, but would later abandon it once more. He then returns to his house in Rio Claro, living in there until 1870. He marries once again, with his cousin Maria Belisária de Brito Lambert, having with her two daughters and one son.
Having moved to Niterói with his father in 1870, he lives there until dying, on February 18, 1875.
Some of Varela's poems have an unusual theme for the Ultra-Romanticism: the Abolitionism. Because of that, he is considered to be one of the forerunners of the "Condorism", alongside Junqueira Freire, another Ultra-Romantic poet who spoke of the Abolitionism in some of his poems.
