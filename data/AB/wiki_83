Earl Barthé

Earl Barthé (June 4, 1922; – January 11, 2010) was an American plasterer and plastering historian. A self-described "Creole of Color", Barthé is particularly admired for preserving many of the old plaster walls and ornamental cornices for historic structures within New Orleans. His family company specializes in historical and decorative plasterwork and the Barthé family has been plastering since 1850. 
The Barthé family settled in New Orleans in the early 19th century and the family business was established by Barthé's great-great-grandfather, a master plasterer from Nice, France, who married a woman from Haiti. The family was known in the term of the time as "free people of color." Over the years, the family has worked on many historic buildings. Most of the fine hotels and old stores along Canal Street as well as the mansions and the cemeteries' tombs on St. Charles Avenue include work by Barthé and his family. Barthé's father worked on such historic buildings as the Saint Louis Cathedral, the French Market, and the Saenger Theater. Barthé has also worked on several notable projects and is known for decorative plaster and stucco work that reflects an array of French, Spanish, Anglo-American neo-classical, and African American aesthetics, in sync with the historic architecture of New Orleans. For his work, Barthé was inducted into the Louisiana AFL-CIO Labor Hall of Fame. Today, Barthé's daughter, Terry Barthé, leads the family business.
In 2001, Barthé was documented as part of the New Orleans Building Arts Project which culminated in an exhibit of his work along with other New Orleans trade artists entitled, "Raised to the Trade: Creole Building Arts in New Orleans". The exhibit toured throughout the United States including presentations at the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution's Folklife Festival. He also received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2005. Recently, Barthé has spent much of his time helping to restore historic buildings in New Orleans that were damaged or destroyed in Hurricane Katrina.

Volcanic Repeating Arms

The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company was a U.S. company formed in 1855 by partners Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson to develop Walter Hunt's Rocket Ball ammunition and lever action mechanism. Volcanic made an improved version of the Rocket Ball ammunition, and a carbine and pistol version of the lever action gun to fire it. While the Volcanic Repeating Arms Company was short lived, its descendants, Smith & Wesson and Winchester Repeating Arms Company, became major firearms manufacturers.
History.
The original 1848 "Volition Repeating Rifle" design by Hunt was revolutionary, introducing an early iteration of the lever action repeating mechanism and the tubular magazine still common today. However, Hunt's design was far from perfect, and only a couple of prototypes were developed; the only one known is currently in the Firearms Museum in Cody, Wyoming. Lewis Jennings patented an improved version of Hunt's design in 1849, and versions of the Jenning's patent design were built by Robbins & Lawrence Co. (under the direction of shop foreman Benjamin Tyler Henry) and sold by C. P. Dixon. Horace Smith was also hired by Courtlandt Palmer to improve the Jennings Rifle, patenting the Smith-Jennings in 1851. It is estimated that fewer than 2000 of these two models were made until 1852, when financial troubles ceased production.
In 1854, partners Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson joined with Courtlandt Palmer, the businessman who had purchased the Jennings and Smith-Jennings patent rights, and further improved on the operating mechanism, developing the Smith & Wesson Lever pistol, and a new Volcanic cartridge. Production was in the shop of Horace Smith in Norwich, Connecticut. The new cartridge improved upon the Hunt Rocket Ball with the addition of a primer. Originally using the name "Smith & Wesson Company", the name was changed to "Volcanic Repeating Arms Company" in 1855, with the addition of new investors, one of which was Oliver Winchester. The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company obtained all rights for the Volcanic designs (both rifle and pistol versions were in production by this time) as well as the ammunition, from the Smith and Wesson Company. Wesson remained as plant manager for 8 months before rejoining Smith to found the "Smith & Wesson Revolver Company" upon obtaining the licensing of the Rollin White rear loading cylinder patent. Winchester forced the insolvency of the Volcanic Arms Company in late 1856, took over ownership and moved the plant to New Haven, Connecticut, where it was reorganized as the New Haven Arms Company in April 1857. B. Tyler Henry was hired as plant superintendent when Robbins & Lawrence suffered financial difficulties and Henry left their employ. While continuing to make the Volcanic rifle and pistol, Henry began to experiment with the new rimfire ammunition, and modified the Volcanic lever action design to use it. The result was the Henry rifle. By 1866, the company once again reorganized, this time as the Winchester Repeating Arms company, and the name of Winchester became synonymous with lever action rifles.
In popular culture.
A .41 caliber Volcanic Repeating Arms pistol was featured in the television show "Pawn Stars" in 2012. The episode, titled "Bear-ly There", included a segment where the pistol was purchased by the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop for $6,500.
The Volcanic Pistol is available as a weapon in Rockstar Games' "Red Dead Redemption" and in the card game "Bang!". Under the name of "Volcano Gun", a Volcanic Pistol appears in Techland's "Call of Juarez" and "". It is the most powerful handgun available in both games.
The 1855 Volcanic pistol was featured during the "Sons of Guns" season 2 episode "World's Largest Machine Gun" in 2012.
A Volcanic pistol appears as an unlockable item for the Shinsengumi agent in "".
A Volcanic Repeating Rifle is featured in the western movie For a Few Dollars More and is used by the Man with No Name and El Indio for a brief period of time.

Woodland (Boston and Albany station)

Woodland Station is one of two surviving railroad stations in the Boston area designed by American architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Although he designed numerous stations along the Worcester line (later the Boston & Albany line and today the MBTA's Green Line "D" Branch), most of the others have been torn down either due to neglect, fire, or construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Like a number of Richardson's later works, this railroad station, finished in 1886, was completed after Richardson's death. 
Located in the village of Auburndale in Newton, Massachusetts, the old Woodland Station is about 150 yards west of the current Woodland (MBTA station). The station sits on the Woodland golf course and is used as a supply shed. Although the building is part of the Newton Railroad Stations Historic District, it has fallen into disrepair and is in need of extensive renovations and possibly transport to a tourist accessible location. In fact, photographs from as early as 1959 show the station boarded up and abandoned. Although the golf course is private property and members-only, the station is easily visible by riding the 'D' line one stop past Woodland to Riverside.
Newton's historic railroad district also contains two Richardsonian stations built after his death by his draftsmen, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. These stations are also along the 'D' line at Newton Center and Newton Highlands. The lower portion of these stations act as outdoor stations while the upper, street-face portions are can be rented out. The Newton Highlands station, used as an auto parts shop for years, is being renovated and is partially occupied by the office of periodontist Leonard H. Strauss, D.M.D., P.C. The Newton Center Station housed a Starbucks, which closed in 2008,) and has been renovated for occupancy by the Deluxe Station Diner, a satellite restaurant of the Deluxe Town Diner in Coolidge Square, Watertown, Massachusetts.

Kamov V-80

The Kamov V-80 was a design study designation for an attack helicopter that eventually evolved into the single seat Kamov Ka-50 family of aircraft.
Design and development.
By the mid-1970s, the Soviet Defense Ministry determined that the Mi-24 “Hind” attack helicopter (then the backbone of the Soviet Army Aviation) was not going to meet future Army requirements. Acting on the advice of the Ministry, the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on the development of a new-generation combat helicopter that could be fielded with the Soviet Army Aviation in the 1980s. The prospective helicopter's primary purpose was to destroy the armored forces close to the forward edge of battle area (FEBA). This resolution pitted competing programs run by N.I. Kamov and Ml. Mil's design bureaus against each other. At that time, both developers had already gained valuable experience in designing and producing rotary-wing aircraft.
Design of the V-80 (later Ka-50), began at the Kamov Helicopter Plant in January 1977. The program was run by the head of the design bureau, Chief Designer Sergei Mikheyev, who was later to become Designer General.
Kamov designers believed that combining the duties of flying, navigation, target detection, and tracking could be automated to a degree that a single crew member could perform all functions. Further, it was not expected that this would cause an excessive psychological and physical strain on the pilot. By the late seventies, the sophistication level of the Soviet helicopter industry ensured the building of such automatic systems was possible; even the Ka-25 and Ka-27 featured an automatic submarine search capability, automatic navigation and flight modes, automatic data exchange among the helicopters operating in the same flight, etc. A single-person crew would provide the benefits of weight reduction, better flight performance, reduce training costs and reduce the number of possible combat casualties.
One of the program priorities was to enhance the helicopter's survivability. With this goal in mind, the configuration and systems' arrangement were chosen, assemblies designed, and structural materials tested. The helicopter lacked a very vulnerable tail rotor as well as an intermediate and tail reduction gearbox and control rods. The following measures to enhance pilot survivability were taken:
• The engines were placed on both sides of the airframe to prevent a single hit from destroying both engines
• The helicopter could fly on a single engine in various modes
• The cockpit was armored and screened with combined steel/aluminum armor and armored Plexiglas
• The hydraulic steering system compartment was armored and screened
• Vital units were screened by less important ones
• Self-sealing fuel tanks were filled with polyurethane
• Composites were used to preserve the helicopter's efficiency when its load-carrying elements are damaged
• A two-contour rotor-blade spar was developed
• Control rod diameter was increased by positioning most of them inside the armored cockpit
• The powerplant and compartments adjacent to the fuel tanks were fire-protected
• The transmission is capable of operating for 30 minutes if the oil system is damaged
• The power supply systems, control circuits, etc. were made redundant and placed on opposite sides of the airframe
• Individual protection is provided to the pilot
The armor consisted of spaced-aluminum plates with a total weight of more than 300 kg. The armor is fitted into the fuselage load-bearing structure, which reduces the total weight of the helicopter. GosNIIAS tests confirmed the pilot's protection up to 20mm caliber cannon rounds and shell fragments.
A unique feature of this helicopter is the use of a rocket-parachute ejection system in case of an emergency. The helicopter emergency-escape system uses the K-37-800 ejection seat that was developed by the Zvezda Scientific Production Association (Chief Designer Guy Severin). The pilot's safety was also ensured by the undercarriage design. The undercarriage is capable of absorbing large loads in an emergency landing, and the cockpit has a crunch zone of up to 10-15% upon impact. Additionally, the fuel system is designed to remove the possibility of fire after a rough landing.
A model of an earlier design from around 1975 shows a two seat aircraft with an airframe similar to that of the V-60, a pair of widely spaced downward facing vertical stabilisers, a fixed GSh-23L forward firing gun in the fuselage and two stub wings incorporating one hardpoint each and a pod containing the retractable undercarriage. Further studies include novel features such as a variable azimuth stub wing, a biplane stub wing/canard configuration, additional fuselage hardpoints, ejecting exhaust on either side of the tail to reduce the heat signature, making the forward firing gun depressible and single seat as well as two seat configurations. Specification weight was 4000 kg empty and 6500 kg takeoff.
The first V-80 prototype (Bort 010) left the Kamov Helicopter Plant in June 1982. On 17 June, for the first time, test pilot Nikolay Bezdetnov performed a hover in the V-80 and on 23 July the V-80 made its maiden forward flight.
The V-80Sh-1 prototype version was the configuration used for the Ka-50 production version. Production of the attack helicopter was ordered by the Soviet Council of Ministers on 14 December 1987. Following initial flight testing and system tests the Council ordered the first batch of the helicopter in 1990. The attack helicopter was first described publicly as the "Ka-50" in March 1992 at a symposium in the United Kingdom.

N5
"Sa4 of Hieroglyphic Luwian"<br>Sa4 is basically identical to the N5 hieroglyph of Gardiner's Sign List for the Egyptian language, which in the hieroglyphs for Ancient Egypt is the representation of the sun, (and also Ra, the sun god). As the representation of the sun in Egypt, it also is translated in many uses for "day", or "time", as word determinatives.
The day, or time uses being the common ones for Egypt, requires that other more ornate forms of reference to Ra, the sun god, were needed. The solar disc was sometimes put on the head as a 'crown'; the major ornate sun disc representation contained the uraeus cobra surrounding it, and the cobra being with up-raised head.

Trusted Internet Connection

The Trusted Internet Connection initiative (also known as TIC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-08-05) is mandated in an OMB Memorandum issued in November 2007. The memorandum was meant to optimize individual external connections, including internet points of presence currently in use by the Federal government of the United States. It includes a program for improving the federal government’s incident response capability through a centralized gateway monitoring at a select group of TIC Access Providers (TICAP). By reducing the number of access points, the government could more easily monitor and identify potentially malicious traffic. 
The initial goal for total number of federal external connections and internet points of presence was 50. General Services Administration Networx is the contract vehicle to implement this initiative.

USS Navasota (AO-106)

USS "Navasota" (AO-106) was an that served in the U.S. Navy from 1946 to 1973, then transferred to the Military Sealift Command to continue service as United States Naval Ship USNS "Navasota" (T-AO-106) until taken out of service in 1992. "Navasota" was sold for scrapping in 1995. She was the only U.S. Navy ship to bear the name "Navasota".
Construction and commissioning.
"Navasota" was laid down under Maritime Commission contract on 22 February 1945 as Maritime Commission hull 2702 by Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 30 August 1945, sponsored by Mrs. A. Hahn, and commissioned on 27 February 1946, Commander David H. McCluskey, USNR, in command.
Operational history, 1946–63.
After three months of shakedown and training off the United States East Coast, "Navasota" steamed via the Panama Canal for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and the western Pacific Ocean. Assigned to Service Force, United States Pacific Fleet, she departed Pearl Harbor on 3 July 1946 to bring petroleum products from the Persian Gulf to the Pacific fleet. She stood out of Yokosuka, Japan, on 20 August 1946 for San Pedro, California, arriving on 2 September 1946. For the next four months the oiler was in an operational training status, and on 30 January 1948 she again deployed to the Western Pacific. After serving as station ship at Tsingtao, China, from April through June 1948, she returned to San Pedro, California, on 7 July 1948, thence to Pearl Harbor in August 1948.
"Navasota" departed Pearl Harbor on 13 October 1948, once again en route the Far East. She departed Yokosuka on 20 November 1948 for Tsingtao and remained on station until 30 December 1948, when she sailed for California via Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Long Beach, California, on 19 January 1949, steamed to Kodiak, Alaska on 1 February 1949, returned to San Francisco on 25 February 1949, and continued to operate on the west coast of the United States for the next year.
"Navasota" again deployed to the Western Pacific on 1 May 1950. When the North Koreans crossed the 38th Parallel on 25 June 1950, beginning the Korean War, the oiler steamed for Korean waters to fuel Allied ships in the area. In late August 1950 she put in at Keelung, Formosa, but she was back in Korean waters to take part in the Inchon invasion on 15 September 1950.
She steamed for Pearl Harbor on 22 October 1950 and then for Japan via Kwajalein and Guam. Departing Japan on 16 December 1950, she arrived at Long Beach on 30 December 1950, only to return to the Far East on 31 March 1951 for further operations off Wonsan, Korea.
During her Korean operations "Navasota" fueled ships in Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, in Buckner Bay on Okinawa, in the Pescadores Islands, in Formosa, in Japan, and in Korea. She returned to Long Beach for overhaul from October 1951 until February 1952. The oiler operated off the U.S. West Coast until getting underway on 3 April 1952 for Sasebo, Japan, and resumption of her Korean fueling operations. She remained in the area of Wonsan and Songjin, Korea, for the next seven months and then returned to Long Beach, arriving there on 13 November 1952.
"Navasota" steamed from Long Beach on 2 February 1953 for Pearl Harbor to participate in Mercantile Convoy Exercise RES 53B, after which she called at Sasebo on 26 February 1953 to commence her fourth Pacific deployment. For the next seven months she conducted fueling operations in Korean waters. She was also used as station ship at Kaohsiung, Formosa, where she fueled units of the Formosa Straits Patrol until she headed for Long Beach on 3 September 1953.
For the next ten years "Navasota" continued to provide fueling services to the fleet through her annual Western Pacific deployments. In one overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard from February to May 1958, all guns save her single 3-inch (76.2-mm) mounts were removed.
Highlights in this period included service as fuel ship during the nuclear weapons tests at Bikini Atoll in the summer of 1956 and her Western Pacific deployment of 1958, when she refueled 174 ships from August through November while serving as station ship at Makung in the Pescadores.
"Jumboization", 1963–64.
Upon completion of her fifteenth Western Pacific deployment on 14 October 1963, "Navasota" was scheduled for "jumboization", the first oiler so designated. She steamed on 14 November 1963 for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, for preliminary preparations, then entered Puget Sound Bridge and Drydock Company, Plant No. 2, Harbor Island, Seattle, Washington. for the conversion. Her new 394-foot (120.1 m) midsection was built in Kawasaki Dock Yard, Kobe, Japan, and towed to Seattle by the Japanese tug Daisho Maru No. 1.
The "jumboization" process consisted of five basic steps. First, the bow was removed and retained in the drydock while the rest of the ship was floated out. Next, the new section was floated in, raised, and joined to the bow. Third, the bridge structure was transferred to the new section by heavy lift crane on 9 January 1964. Then the stern section was severed and retained in drydock while the old midsection was floated out. In the last step, the new section with bow and bridge structure attached, was floated into the dock, raised, and joined to the stern.
Although replacement of the midsection was the single largest change in the $15,000,000 process, many other important improvements were made during the conversion. A major modification was made to the stern, including a new counterbalanced rudder, new stern casting and struts, and new shorter propeller shafts and stern tubes. The latest in fueling and replenishment at sea equipment was also added, including kingposts with outriggers, ram tensioned span wires and high lines, electric hydraulic winches, cargo elevators, helo pickup area, and sliding blocks and cargo drop reels at replenishment stations. New electric pumps, larger cargo piping, and double hose fueling rigs were also added, as well as a 4,500-kilowatt auxiliary diesel generator plant, and more enclosed stowage space. Habitability was also improved.
Her "jumboization" complete, "Navasota" left the shipyard on 28 December 1964.
1965–75.
After upkeep and training, "Navasota" steamed 20 August 1965 on her sixteenth Western Pacific deployment, arriving at Subic Bay on 11 September 1965 and returning to Long Beach on 6 June 1966.
"Navasota" again steamed for the Western Pacific on 11 October 1966. Arriving at Subic Bay on 3 November 1966, she operated in the Gulf of Tonkin and in coastal waters off North and South Vietnam in support of United States Seventh Fleet warships conducting operations in the Vietnam War, with Subic Bay as her base of operations. The summer of 1967 brought the oiler back to Long Beach for upkeep and U.S. West Coast operations until she again deployed to the Western Pacific on 5 January 1968 to assume support duties for Seventh Fleet forces off Vietnam. Through at least 1970 she continued to deploy to the Western Pacific for six to eight months of each year, spending the remainder operating out of Long Beach as part of Service Force, Pacific Fleet, in support of United States First Fleet operations and Fleet Training Group, San Diego, California.
"Navasota" was decommissioned on 13 August 1975 and transferred to the Military Sealift Command, in which she served as USNS "Navasota" (T-AO-106) until 1991.
Later career and disposition.
"Navasota" began active service with the Military Sealift Command in 1975. She was taken out of service in 1991. "Navasota" was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 January 1992. She was sold for scrapping on 25 October 1995.
Battle Honors.
USS "Navasota" received nine battle stars for her Korean War service and 14 campaign stars for her Vietnam War service.

Verbandsliga Hamburg-Germania

The Verbandsliga Hamburg-Germania was the fourth tier of the German football league system and the second-highest league in the German state of Hamburg, together with the "Verbandsliga Hamburg-Hansa" and "Verbandsliga Hamburg-Hammonia", until its disbanding in 1970.
Overview.
1947 to 1950.
The league was formed in 1947, alongside three other divisions on the same level in the City of Hamburg, as the Bezirksklasse Hamburg-Germania. The other three leagues were:
The four new leagues replaced the "1. Klasse Hamburg" as the feeder leagues to the "Stadtliga Hamburg", which was now renamed "Verbandsliga Hamburg". The "1. Klasse Hamburg" had been operating since the end of the Second World War in 1945 and consisted of three divisions. The change in the league system at this level came together with the establishment of the "Oberliga Nord" as the new tier-one league in Northern Germany. This meant the new "Bezirksklasse" in Hamburg was now the third tier of the league system, below "Oberliga" and "Verbandsliga".
The league started out with eleven clubs, with the league champion being promoted to the "Verbandsliga". In its second season, the league expanded to thirteen clubs. The league above it was renamed from "Verbandsliga Hamburg" to "Amateurliga Hamburg" at the end of this season. The year after, in 1950, the "Amateurliga" was then reduced to one single division from the two it had been operating at previously.
For the "Bezirksklasse", this also meant a change: The four existing divisions were disbanded and replaced by two leagues:
For the "Germania-division" (German: "Germania-Staffel") this meant a temporary end to its operation.
1953 to 1970.
In 1953, the league was once more reestablished and the "Elbe-Staffel" and "Alster-Staffel" disbanded. Three of the four leagues in existence until 1950 were reformed, the "Olympia-Staffel" however, was not. The leagues were now named "Verbandsligas":
Each of the three divisions had now fourteen clubs and the league champion was again promoted directly to the "Amateurliga Hamburg". The leagues were again the third tier of the German league system. In the fourteen-team per division era, usually the bottom two teams of each division were relegated. Additionally, teams would be moved between the three divisions according to geographical necessity, to balance them out.
In 1963, the Fußball-Bundesliga was established in Germany. The old "Oberliga Nord" was disbanded and at its stead, the "Regionalliga Nord" was set as the second tier of the league system. The "Amateurliga Hamburg", now renamed "Landesliga Hamburg", slipped to third tier in the league system, making the three "Verbandsligas" the fourth tier now. Otherwise, nothing changed for the three leagues.
In the first couple of seasons after 1963, nothing changed for the three leagues.
In 1970, the "Germania-Staffel" was disbanded, leaving only the "Hansa" and "Hammonia" division on this level, as it is today.
Of the fifteen clubs in the league in 1969-70, the league winner was promoted to the "Landesliga" while the teams placed second to ninth were split between the other two divisions. The remainder of the clubs was relegated.
League champions.

Alberto Flores Galindo

Alberto Flores Galindo (Bellavista, Callao, May 28, 1949 - Lima, March 26, 1990) was a famous Peruvian historian, social scientist, and essay writer. He was the founder of the Centro de Investigacion Casa SUR.
Biography.
Alberto Flores Galindo was born in Lima to a medium-class family. He spent his school years studying in the Lima private religious school "Colegio La Salle". Later, he studied History at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru. At age 22 he had already concluded his thesis on miners from Cerro de Pasco, which was graded as "outstanding." This thesis was later published by the university in the form of a book.
As a result of his studies, he obtained a scholarship from the École des hautes études en sciences sociales of Paris. Upon returning to Peru he dedicated his time to university research at the Universidad Católica, and also spent time as a reporter for newspapers and magazines. During the 1980s he founded SUR, the Casa de Estudios del Socialismo (House of Socialist Studies), and made it both an editorial house and a center of intellectual discussions. Moreover, he also founded the magazine "Margenes" and published it through SUR.
He was a prolific historian and one of the most influent Peruvian leftist intellectuals of the 1980s. Flores Galindo constantly promoted various debates about Marxism through intellectual thought ("La Agonia de Mariategui", 1980) and social history ("Aristocracia y Plebe", 1984). In this last book he was inspired by the works of E.P. Thompson, an English Marxist historian. With this influence, he was able to analyze and understand Peruvian colonial society in terms of class, understanding class -much like Thompson- not as a thing in itself but as a set of relationships. Other major influences in his works came from Frantz Fanon, the French historians from the Annales School, and the Peruvians Jose Carlos Mariategui, Jose Maria Arguedas, and Jorge Basadre.
The collection of essays entitled "Buscando un Inca: Indentidad y Utopia en los Andes" (Searching for an Inca: Identity and Utopia in the Andes), originally published in 1986, obtained the Premio Ensayo de Casa de las Americas in Cuba. With the book, Flores Galindo sought to formulate a link between socialist thought and Andean traditions. He was the first historian to write about racism in Peru through the 1988 version of "Buscando un Inca" in the chapter entitled "República sin Ciudadanos" (Republic without Citizens).

Everett Gendler

Everett Gendler (born August 8, 1928) is an American rabbi, known for his involvement in progressive causes, including the American civil rights movement, Jewish nonviolence, and the egalitarian Jewish Havurah movement. From 1978-1995, he served as the first Jewish Chaplain at Phillips Academy, Andover. He has been described as the "father of Jewish environmentalism".
Biography.
Gendler was born in Chariton, Iowa in 1928 to a religious Jewish family who moved to Des Moines in 1939. He earned a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1948 during the heyday of Robert Hutchins’ leadership, and remained at Chicago until 1951 studying with such luminaries as Rudolf Carnap. In 1957, he was ordained as a Conservative rabbi by the Jewish Theological Seminary.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gendler served as rabbi to a number of congregations throughout Latin America, including the Beth Israel Community Center in Mexico City, Mexico (1957–59), the Associacao Religiosa Israelita in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (1961), and the five congregations of Havana, Cuba (High Holidays and Passover, 1968–69). From 1962-1967, Gendler served as rabbi at the Jewish Center of Princeton, New Jersey.
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gendler, along with his wife Mary Gendler (born 1940) was involved in several alternative residential communities, including Ivan Illich’s Centro Intercultural de Documentación in Cuernavaca, Mexico (1968-69) (alongside Harvey Cox ) and the inter-racial inter-religious living center Packerd Manse in Stoughton, Massachusetts (1969-71).
In 1971, Gendler became rabbi at Temple Emanuel of the Merrimack Valley and in 1977, Gendler was appointed by Ted Sizer as the first Jewish chaplain at Phillips Academy, Andover as part of a Catholic-Protestant-Jewish “tri-ministry”. Gendler remained in his position at Phillips Andover, alongside his position at Temple Emanuel of the Merrimack Valley, until his retirement, at the age of 67, in 1995.
Since 1995, Gendler, along with his wife Mary Gendler, has been involved in community education work among the Tibetan exiles on Strategic Nonviolent Struggle. In 2007, they played a central role in the founding of the Active Nonviolence Education Center in Dharmasala, India.

Civil rights work.
Gendler became involved in the American Civil Rights movement in the mid-1950s, sparked by his involvement in the American Jewish Society for Service 1955 summer institute at the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee. During the 1960s, he played a pivotal role in involving American Jews in the movement, leading groups of American Rabbis to participate in prayer vigils and protests in Albany, Georgia (1962), Birmingham, Alabama (1963) and Selma, Alabama (1965), and persuading Abraham Joshua Heschel to participate in the famous march from Selma to Montgomery (1965)
. Gendler was instrumental in arranging Martin Luther King’s important address to the national rabbinical convention on March 25, 1968, 10 days before King’s death.
Gendler was also an early proponent in Judaism of equal rights for gays, women’s ritual participation, and Palestinian rights.
Jewish nonviolence.
Gendler advocates the position that religious nonviolence is as much a part of Judaism as it is of other religions. His most widely distributed article on this topic is "Therefore Choose Life" anthologized in Roots of Jewish Nonviolence and The Challenge of Shalom. Gendler has served on the board of the Jewish Peace Fellowship and currently serves on the board of the Shomer Shalom Institute for Jewish Nonviolence.

In 1978, he installed the world’s first solar-powered eternal light on the roof of his Synagogue in Lowell Massachusetts. Over the next 30 years, he published dozens of articles on Jewish environmentalism and gave hundreds of lectures on the topic. In 2008, he received a “Lifetime Achievement” award for his contributions to Jewish environmentalism from the Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center. In 2013, he was honored with the Presidents' Medallion from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in recognition of "a life of passionate devotion to humankind" and a "lifetime of commitment to social justice and environmentalism." Also in 2013, his lifetime of work was recognized through the creation of the Gendler Grapevine Project, a six-year initiative designed to celebrate and perpetuate Gendler's life work, and serve as a permanent repository of his articles and teachings.

Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque

The Sokollu Mehmet Pasha Mosque () is an Ottoman mosque located in the Kadirga neighborhood of the Fatih district of Istanbul, Turkey.
History.
The mosque was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan for the grand vizier Sokollu Mehmet Pasha (the husband of one of the granddaughters of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, Princess Esmahan). According to the foundation inscription, the building was completed in AH 979 (1571/72 CE). The mosque is officially named after Princess Esmahan, but is more commonly known for its association with her far more famous husband.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The mosque is noted for its architecturally challenging location on a steep slope. Sinan resolved this issue by fronting the mosque with a two-story courtyard. The bottom story (now in ruins) was divided into shops, whose rents were intended to help support the upkeep of the mosque. The upper story with an open colonnaded courtyard had the spaces between the columns on three sides walled off to form small rooms, each with a small window, fireplace and niche to store bedding, forming the living accommodations for a madrasah. Instruction for students was given in the prayer hall itself, or in the "dershane", a large domed room over the western staircase. The fourth side of the courtyard is the mosque itself, which is designed as a hexagon inscribed in a rectangle, topped by a dome with four small semi-domes in the corners.
Interior.
The interior of the Sokollu Mehmet Pasha Mosque is famous for its large quantities of İznik tiles, set in a very wide variety of blue and green floral designs, with panels of calligraphy in white letters on a blue field. The interior columns make use of polychrome marble. The "minbar" is made of white marble with a conical cap, sheathed in turquoise tiles, which also frame the "mihrab". The windows above the mithrab are stained glass. Above the door, framed by a gold design, is a fragment of the Kaaba in Mecca; other fragments of this black stone are in the "minbar" and "mihrab".

Ian North

Ian North (born 24 March 1952 in New York) is an American musician, producer and painter known for being part of the bohemian punk movement in United States with his power pop band Milk 'N' Cookies. A self-taught artist, he was also interested in painting.
Biography.
Early Years.
Ian North was born in Brooklyn in 1952. He grew up in Long Island. He received his first guitar at age 12, but being virtually tone deaf, could not play any songs other than those he composed.
In 1970, he slowly started to get serious about his artwork.
Milk 'N' Cookies.
In 1973, North formed a power pop and glam outfit called Milk 'N' Cookies along Justin Strauss on voice, Jay Weis (replaced by Sal Maida, later in Roxy Music and Sparks) on bass and Mike Ruiz on drums (later in Paul Collins' Beat). While the album's release was initially delayed and largely ignored upon release, it has subsequently become a cult classic. 
After its reissue in 2005, the band was headlined the Radio Heartbeat festival in 2007 without North, where the band played alongside a slew of younger bands that now claimed Milk 'n' Cookies as an influence. Since then, the band has garnered even more attention as groups like Nobunny and Cheap Time have gained in popularity.
British Punk and New Wave scene: Radio and Neo.
After the split of Milk 'N' Cookies, North dedicated to the then-new punk movement in Britain, forming Radio with Sparks bassist Martin Gordon and the Simon brothers, Paul and Robert. That group transformed to Neo after Gordon's departure (he joined Radio Stars) and changed line-ups, with North being the only remaining member until 1979, when his visa ended and returned to his native USA. The same year, 12 Neo tracks were released in Britain by Aura Records as North solo album (called Neo).
Return to USA and solo career.
Back in New York, North took to newly affordable synth technology and recording equipment, first on his debut full-length album as a solo artist, "My Girlfriend's Dead, and then on his Rape Of The Orchids" EP. During this time he also produced material for The Fast; he also filled in as the band's bassist in the music videos for their songs "Kids Just Wanna Dance" and "Love Me Like a Locomotive".
From 1983 to 1993, North worked sporadically on the album "Torch Songs & Arson". While the label originally slated to release the album folded in the decade over which it was created, it has since been made available for free download.
In 2009, North ended the longest period of musical inactivity in his life, releasing the groundbreaking 12-song album, "E Z Listening For Suicides", under the moniker "Darkjet".

Payment Deferred (film)

Payment Deferred (1932) is a film starring Charles Laughton as a man so desperate for money, he resorts to murder. It was based on the play of the same name by Jeffrey Dell, which was in turn based on the novel of the same name by C. S. Forester. Laughton also played the lead role in the play, which opened on Broadway on September 30, 1931 and ran for 70 performances.
Plot.
London bank clerk William Marble (Charles Laughton) is deeply in debt. When his boss learns of a lawsuit for an overdue bill, he warns Marble that he will be dismissed if he cannot settle the matter quickly. 
Then, Marble is visited by a rich nephew whom he has not seen in many years, James Medland (Ray Milland). All night, Marble tries to borrow money from him, having received a financial tip that could solve all his financial troubles. However, Medland is not interested. Driven to desperation, Marble poisons his nephew and buries the body in the back yard. 
With the dead man's money, Marble speculates on margin and makes £30,000, a large sum that enables him to retire. However, fear of his crime being discovered makes him consistently nervous and irritable. His wife Annie (Dorothy Peterson) knows something is wrong, but wrongly guesses he has embezzled from the bank. 
To relieve his nervous tension, he sends Annie and their daughter Winnie (Maureen O'Sullivan) away on a three-week vacation. While they are gone, he has an affair with Madame Collins (Verree Teasdale), a local shopowner. Winnie finds out when she returns a day early and discovers Collins in the house, but keeps quiet about it. 
Despite their new financial wealth, troubles continue to grow for the Marble family. Annie finally figures out what her husband has done, but stands by him. Winnie becomes a bit of a snob, consorting with a higher social class of people and sneering at her parents. When she runs away one night, Annie chases after her in the rain and becomes very ill. However, under Marble's loving care, she begins to recover.
Then Madame Collins shows up and blackmails Marble into giving her some money. Annie overhears and commits suicide with some of the same cyanide used to kill Medland. Marble is convicted for her murder.

Battle of Tskhinvali

The Battle of Tskhinvali (, ) was a fight for the city of Tskhinvali, capital of South Ossetia. It was the only major battle in the 2008 South Ossetia War. Georgian ground troops entered the city on early 8 August 2008, after an extensive artillery barrage. Their advance was stopped by South Ossetian militia and members of the International peacekeeping force stationed in the city. Later that day, Russian combat troops began entering South Ossetia through the Roki tunnel. After being initially forced to withdraw, the Georgian troops made several attempts to retake the city. Due to the difficult logistics of the terrain, the arrival of Russian reinforcements was slow. After fierce fighting, Georgian troops were finally forced to withdraw from the city on the evening of 10 August. On 11 August, all Georgian troops left South Ossetia. Parts of Tskhinvali were devastated in the three-day fighting.
Background.
Deployment and goals.
The cities of Tskhinvali and Gori are located in the valley of the Greater Liakhvi River, within about of each other. The Georgian military was based at Gori, to the south, while Tskhinvali was the primary objective of the Georgian forces. It was suggested by Civil Georgia, that the ultimate goal of the Georgian forces was to control the Roki Tunnel further north, which is the sole major land route from Russia to South Ossetia. Another strategically important target was the Didi Gupta bridge, which links the northern part of South Ossetia to its southern part where Tskhinvali is located.
The Georgian forces deployed on the South Ossetian border on 7 August included the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades, the Artillery Brigade, elements of the 1st Infantry Brigade, and the separate Gori Tank Battalion, plus special forces and Ministry of the Internal Affairs troops  — as many as 16,000 men, according to Moscow Defense Brief. International Institute for Strategic Studies and Western intelligence experts give a lower estimate, saying that the Georgians had amassed about 12,000 troops and 75 tanks on the South Ossetian border by 7 August. On the opposite side, there were said to be 1,000 Russian peacekeepers (under the mandate of Joint Control Commission for Georgian–Ossetian Conflict Resolution) and 500 South Ossetian fighters ready to defend Tskhinvali, according to an estimate quoted by "Der Spiegel".
The South Ossetian military forces consisted primarily of light rifle battalions with seconded artillery units and obsolete Soviet-made armoured vehicles. The total strength of the republic's military and law enforcement personnel, including reserve units which took part in the combat, was less than 3,500. In anticipation of a Georgian operation to destroy the Roki tunnel, South Ossetia had deployed the bulk of its force to protect the tunnel and the town of Java in the north, which had left Tskhinvali sparsely defended.
According to Konstantin Makienko, Deputy Director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (CAST), the Georgian objective in the Battle of Tskhinvali was a rapid destruction of Ossetian armed forces and a lightning capture of Tskhinvali before the Russian army could have a chance to intervene. "It appears that during the night from 7 to 8 August. Tbilisi intended to deliver strikes on the positions of the Russian peacekeepers and the South Ossetian army in order to paralyze the chain of command. The next objective was to take Tskhinvali during 8 August, install a puppet government by Dmitry Sanakoyev and bring residents of Georgian enclaves in the republic onto the streets during pro-Georgia mass rallies."
Battle.
Georgian attack.
Artillery preparation.
At 23:35 on 7 August, Georgian artillery units began firing smoke bombs into South Ossetia. Soon afterwards, Georgia opened fire against fixed and moving targets of enemy forces.
The less than 10 minute interval was supposed to allow the civilian population to leave dangerous areas. At 23:45, OSCE monitors reported, that shells were falling on Tskhinvali every 15–20 seconds. The equipment used in the artillery and rocket barrage included 27 rocket launchers, such as BM-21 Grad units; 152-millimetre guns, as well as cluster munitions.
Operation Clear Field.
Early on the morning of 8 August, Georgia launched a ground attack (codenamed Operation Clear Field) against Tskhinvali, as well as operations on the left and right flanks of the city. The left flank operation was undertaken by the 4th Infantry Brigade coming from Vaziane, while the 3rd Infantry Brigade from Kutaisi took to the right flank. The aim of the flank operations was to occupy important heights around Tskhinvali and then, moving further northwards, to take control of the strategically important Didi Gupta bridge and the roads, including the Ossetian-controlled Dzara by-pass road, leading from the Roki tunnel to Tskhinvali. This was done in order to block Russian reinforcements from travelling through the tunnel to Tskhinvali.
After the heights surrounding Tskhinvali were occupied, special forces of the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), equipped with Otokar Cobra armoured vehicles, moved into the city. Their assault was supported by artillery, tanks and Su-25 ground attack planes. Georgia says that the entry to Tskhinvali took place at 06:00 am; according to South Ossetian sources, a tank attack by Georgian forces on the southern suburbs of Tshkinvali had already been repelled by South Ossetian forces at 03:46 am. By 08:00 am, Georgian infantry and tanks were engaged in a fierce battle with Ossetian forces and the Russian JPFK peacekeeping battalion stationed in the city. According to Georgian officials, 1,500 Georgian ground troops had reached the centre of Tskhinvali by 10:00 am, but were pushed back three hours later by Russian artillery and air attacks. An estimated 10,000–11,000 soldiers took part in the general Georgian offensive in South Ossetia.
At 12:15 am on 8 August, the commander of the Russian JPKF peacekeepers, Marat Kulakhmetov, reported to the OSCE monitors that his unit had come under fire and that they had casualties. According to the official Russian timeline, by 11 am Georgian forces had captured the southern base of the JPFK peacekeeping battalion, and were attempting to take the northern peacekeeper base. In order to break down the resistance of peacekeepers and South Ossetian forces, Georgia sent in armoured units. The servicemen stationed at the northern base repelled five Georgian attacks and were continuing to engage overwhelming enemy forces. At this point, the peacekeepers allegedly suffered their first casualties: two servicemen killed and five wounded. Georgia maintains that it only targeted Russian peacekeepers in self-defence, after coming under fire from their bases. In total, 10 Russian Peacekeeping force soldiers were killed during the war. The peacekeepers' cafeteria was completely destroyed and all of their buildings went up in flames.
Georgian advance is stopped.
By the afternoon of 8 August, the Georgian military had reportedly taken control of large parts of Tskhinvali, the only exceptions being the northern quarters and the centre of the city. However, the Georgian forces were now meeting heavy resistance from Ossetian militia as well as Russian soldiers that were being reinforced via the Roki tunnel. During 8 August the Russian air force mounted attacks on the advancing Georgian infantry as well as on the Georgian artillery, but stopped making sorties for the remainder of the battle, after taking early losses from anti-aircraft fire. The Georgian flank operations were not successful in achieving their main goal of blocking the Gupta bridge and the main routes leading to Tshkinvali from the Roki tunnel and the Java base. The Georgians became bogged down and their advance was stopped. Ossetian snipers managed to kill a Georgian special forces member and later that day a Russian precision air strike killed 20 Georgian soldiers, bringing the fatal casualties of the Georgian Armed Forces to a total of 41 at that time.
Russian counterattack.
Arrival of Russian reinforcements.
According to Western intelligence agencies, the involvement of Russian regular forces began at 07:30 on 8 August, when Russia launched an SS-21 short-range ballistic missile against military and government bunker positions in the city Borzhomi, southwest of Gori. The first Russian air attack was recorded two hours later, at around 09:30, on the village of Shavshvebi in the Gori District.
The Security Council of South Ossetia appealed to Russia at around 11:00 on 8 August, requesting military help. Soon after this, the Russian government made a decision to conduct an operation to prevent Georgia from seizing the territory of South Ossetia.
The first Russian combat unit—a battalion of the 135th Motorized Rifle Regiment—passed through the Roki Tunnel at 14:30 on 8 August, 14 hours after the Georgians had begun their assault on Tskhinvali, according to a senior Russian official. The unit was said to have reached Tskhinvali on the evening of 8 August, meeting fierce resistance from Georgian forces. Georgia disputes the account, saying, that it was in heavy combat with Russian forces near the tunnel long before dawn on 8 August. According to the Georgian account the first Russian units crossed the tunnel at 5:40 on 8 August, passed through Java and proceeded to advance on Tskhinvali, using the Dzari bypass road. The first motorcade of Russian tanks, armored vehicles and ammunition trucks reached Tskhinvali at 18:44 and opened fire on the Georgian forces in the city and surrounding heights. The second motorcade, which also came from Russia via the Roki tunnel, was stopped near the Georgian-controlled area of Dmenisi, 7 kilometers north of Tskhinvali, and the Russians commenced heavy fire on Georgian forces.
Air operations in South Ossetia.
Russian aircraft—including Su-24, Su-25, Su-27 and Tu-22M models—started flying missions over South Ossetia in the early hours of 8 August. Targets inside Georgia proper were also bombed. Some sources have claimed that Russia managed to establish air superiority. However, according to CAST, Russia never gained air superiority in the South Ossetian theatre, as the Russian Air Force took early losses (3 Su-25s) to Georgian anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to stop making sorties for the rest of the battle. Citing eyewitness reports, CAST writes that "... there were no Russian aircraft over Tskhinvali on 8 August or the following day, that is, during the most critical period of the conflict. In effect, the Russian military command was forced to bring motor-rifle units into battle from the march, without first gaining superiority in numbers and firepower." Russian aviation only reappeared on 10 August. The Georgian troops had at least one battalion of relatively modern Buk-M1 self-propelled SAM systems, at least two battalions (a total of eight units) of Osa-AK self-propelled SAM systems and 6 to 10 of the upgraded Osa-AKM version. The Georgian army managed to deploy surprisingly strong, air defenses right in the conflict zone.
The Russian Air Force made a total of 200 sorties during the war, including missions in Georgia proper. Due to the lack of widespread night-vision equipment, it mostly operated during daytime, while the Georgian Air Force was able to operate at night as well. Problems in suppressing enemy air defences (partly due to lack of training in this role), meant that the Russian air force was unable to provide direct support to its own troops. Even by 11 August, Russia had not completely achieved air dominance, and the Georgian aircraft were still attacking Russian troops and Tskhinvali, according to International Institute for Strategic Studies. Moscow Defense Brief strongly criticised the performance of the Russian Air Force, saying that there was a total absence of co-operation between the army and air force, and that of the total 6 Russian planes lost during the war, half were downed by friendly fire.
Fighting between Georgian and Russian forces.
Later on 8 August, according Moscow Defense Brief, three tactical battalion groups from the 135th, 503rd and 693rd Motorized Rifle Regiments of the 19th Motorized Rifle Division (based in Vladikavkaz) of the 58th Army of the North Caucasus Military District were deployed in battle formation to Java and Gufta and by the end of the day had cleared the roads and heights around Dzari, Kverneti and Tbeti districts and as far as the western edge of Tskhinvali. In total, the Russians moved between 5,500 and 10,000 troops to South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel, according to Der Spiegel.
During the evening of 8 August, vicious fighting was going on in the area of Tskhinvali and in South Ossetia. Russian special units reportedly prevented Georgian saboteurs from blowing up the Roki Tunnel, which could have hindered the sending of reinforcements to South Ossetia. Official military casualties, as reported on 8 August, were claimed to be 30 Georgians including 20 which were killed by airstrikes and 21 Russian soldiers so far.
Experiencing growing resistance, the Georgian forces withdrew from the centre of Tshkinvali but still held their positions in the southern parts of the town. They were regrouped and reinforced by the 2nd Infantry Brigade from Senaki. The 4th Brigade reinforced the Ministry of Interior special forces in Tshkinvali, while positions and objectives of the 4th Brigade on the left flank were transferred to the 2nd Brigade.
The passage of Russian forces through the narrow Roki Tunnel and along the mountain roads was slow and the Russians had difficulties in concentrating their troops, forcing them to bring their forces into battle battalion by battalion.
In the afternoon of 9 August, a fierce battle took place as the regrouped Georgian troops tried to regain their control of position in Tskhinvali. The Georgians were able to launch several attacks, including some with tanks. The assault was met with resistance and the Georgians suffered losses, forcing them to withdraw.
The ambush.
At 3 a.m. on 9 August, a convoy led by Russia's 58th Army commander Lieutenant General Anatoly Khrulyov moved into Tskhinvali from the Roki Tunnel and got ambushed by Georgian special troops aided by a number of reservists. Only 5 of the original 30 vehicles strong mechanized battalion were initially reported to had survived the attack. General Khrulyov was wounded very early by shrapnel and unable to control the situation. A Russian major named Denis Vetchinov created a defense perimeter to evacuate the wounded. Eyewitness accounts from the journalists who moved with the column state that Khrulyov was constantly trying to call for reinforcements shouting into the radio that his entire unit was about to be wiped out. While the Georgians were tightening the ring, Vetchinov managed to keep them at distance and is credited with killing a Georgian soldier while being wounded severely in both legs. When trying to change position he got hit in the head and died of his wounds afterwards. The remaining Russian units managed to break out of the encirclement carrying out their general and badly wounded Vetchinov. The Georgian forces eventually ran out of ammunition and abandoned the area expecting a Russian counter-attack. At 5 a.m. on 9 August, according to a Russia Today timeline, a Russian unit broke through to the camp of the besieged peacekeepers and started evacuating the wounded.
Turning point and Georgian withdrawal.
By the morning of 10 August, the Georgians had captured almost the whole of Tskhinvali, forcing the Ossetian forces and Russian peacekeeping battalion to retreat to the northern reaches of the city. However, as the Russian intervention advanced and Russia's forces gained superiority on the ground, signs of moral collapse appeared among the Georgian troops in the afternoon, as Russian air sorties continued. Moscow Defense Brief writes: "... on this very day the accumulation of Russian forces in the region finally bore fruit and the fighting in South Ossetia reached a turning point. Toward the evening of 10 August, Tskhinvali was completely cleared of Georgian forces, which retreated to the south of the city. Georgian forces were also repelled from the key Prisi heights. The bulk of Georgia’s artillery was defeated. Meanwhile, Ossetian forces, with the support of Russian divisions, took Achabeti, Kekhvi, Kurta and Tamarasheni on the approach to Tskhinvali from the north. Georgian forces in several of Georgian enclaves were pushed out." During the withdrawal, the Georgian 4th Brigade was bombarded by Russian aircraft and the unit suffered heavy casualties. Only in the area around the village of Zemo-Nikosi did Georgian units stubbornly resist, repelling several large Russian attacks for a short time, but were soon defeated. Nevertheless, Georgian units and artillery continued to shell Tskhinvali from a number of high points. By the end of 11 August South Ossetia was completely cleared of Georgian forces, and Russian units moved into Georgia proper by the next morning.
According to a CAST claims, the Georgian troops maintained the tactical initiative on the outskirts of Tskhinvali throughout 9 August and even during 10 August. "What thwarted the Georgian operation in the end was not the Russian Air Force, but the resistance offered by peacekeepers and lightly armed, poorly organized South Ossetian units that stayed behind to defend the capital... Essentially, the Georgian troops failed to take Tskhinvali because they were not prepared psychologically for severe urban fighting."
The Georgian Defence Minister later acknowledged, that the Georgian military tried to push into Tskhinvali three times in all. During the last attempt, they got a very heavy Russian-led counterattack with massive air support which Georgian officials described as "something like hell." In total, the fighting in the Tskhinvali area lasted for three days and nights.
Aftermath.
Casualties.
Tskhinvali Hospital's chief surgeon, interviewed by Human Rights Watch, spoke of 273 wounded, both military and civilians, and 44 dead bodies being brought to the hospital, supposedly the majority of people killed in the city. The hospital itself was damaged by a rocket and patients had to be moved into the basement during the fighting. Due to hot weather and the ongoing fighting many Tskhinvali civilians were buried by relatives or neighbours in the backyards of houses. Therefore, the total number of civilian casualties is hard to identify.
Several journalists were reported to be among the casualties, including the two, who were embedded with the ambushed Russian armoured column, in which General Khrulyov was wounded.

Weber County Sheriff's Office

The Weber County Sheriff's Office is a law enforcement agency in Weber County, Utah.
History.
The county's territorial sheriff had responsibility for all Weber County boundaries as defined by the Utah Territorial Legislature in October 1850.
The county was immense. The 42nd parallel, the southern boundary of the Oregon Territory, current southern boundary of Oregon and Idaho, became the northern boundary of Weber County and was also the northern boundary of Utah Territory. The western boundary of Utah Territory was the Sierra Nevada in California, which also became the western boundary of Weber County. The county also acquired new territory to the east with the county boundary being set where the Weber River "enters a canyon about four miles below the ford on Emigration road." The southern boundary of the county ran through a point at "the junction of the county road and the head water of Rocky Creek, being about two miles south of the mouth of Weber River Canyon. This boundary line extended west to California.
In 1855, due to additional growth, the boundaries were changed. The area in Weber County that now is Davis County was defined as Davis County. In 1862, the area of Box Elder County was formed, thereby reducing Weber County's size further.
In 1866 Weber County lost a piece of land that became Morgan County. In 1880, Weber County was given a wedge-shaped portion of the Great Salt Lake. This also brought Fremont Island under Weber County jurisdiction. In 1898, the state legislature codified the boundaries of the counties.
On August 4, 1851, Benjamin F. Cummings was elected Sheriff. During this time, he was also a Captain in the county militia. By 1857 he had been raised to the rank of Major. The Weber County Sheriff's Office had its beginnings in 1852 when probate judge Isaac Clark of the Weber County Court appointed R. W. Cummings to the office of County Sheriff. The city marshal and the sheriff worked closely with the city and county courts to enforce the laws.
Many settlers during this period of time, lived on a city lot in Ogden and had additional acreage to farm in outlying areas surrounding Ogden City. In 1854, the population of Ogden was approximately150 families, Uintah City approximately 35 families, North Ogden had 47 families, Bingham's Fort (northwest end of Ogden) had 732 residents. The county had three schools and two stores. The U. S. Census of 1850 lists the population of Weber County at 1,141 people.
Henry Beckstead and his family were one of the first settlers in the Uintah area of Weber County. He was the second Sheriff for Weber County from 1856-1859.
Lester Herrick, a local businessman in the area, was the Sheriff of Weber County in 1860. He was later elected mayor of Ogden City for seven two-year terms. He held the office in 1871, 1873, 1875, 1879, and 1881. There were two parties: the Liberal party and the Peoples Party. Mayor Herrick ran on the Peoples Party ticket. By 1860, the population of Weber County was 1,807.
During the 1860s, Weber County continued to grow with additional commerce and industry. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act into law.
By 1870, the population of Weber County had increased to 7,358. The increase was tied to the coming of the railroad.
William Brown and Thomas J. Stevens were elected Sheriffs of Weber County during the coming of the railroad. The Union Pacific Railroad track was completed to Ogden on March 8, 1869. The expansion of rail lines through Echo Canyon provided work for citizens living in Weber County. Ogden City Mayor Lorin Farr and his partners contracted with Central Pacific Railroad for work maintaining Central Pacific lines. With the coming of the railroad, the population increased, as travel from coast to coast now only took seven days. As the population increased, crime throughout northern Utah also increased.
By 1880, the county had 12,344 residents. This increased to 22,273 by 1890.
Gilbert R. Belnap was elected sheriff of Weber County in 1884 and served 14 years in that position. As sheriff, he was involved in arresting a variety of criminals, including train robbers, gamblers, and other law-breakers. Belnap was paid $80 a month and had to furnish and feed his own horse and equipment. One of his most famous arrests was that of Joseph Nay and E. K. Fisher, who had robbed a Denver and Rio Grande train in September 1889 and were captured in an Ogden pool hall. When they were captured, Belnap noted that they had enough "dynamite cartridges" on them to blow up the building.
Fallen officers.
Since the establishment of the Weber County Sheriff's Office, one officer has died in the line of duty.

Camilla Kenyon

Camilla Kenyon was an American author of two novels and several short works. Her first novel was "Spanish Doubloons", originally published in 1919 by Bobbs Merrill, also serialized in Munsey's Magazine and republished in a less-costly hardback edition by the A.L. Burt Company. This lively story of a group of treasure hunters on a Pacific island is told from the first person viewpoint of the heroine. It is widely available today as a free e-book from numerous sites, and it has also been reprinted in a paperback edition.
Her second novel was "Fortune At Bandy's Flat", published by Bobbs Merrill in 1921. Again told in the first person, by the eighteen-year-old heroine, this is a story of romance and adventure set in the fictional Sierra mountains hamlet of Bandy's Flat, a community where gold was mined years earlier. This book has also been reprinted and is currently available in paperback.
Camilla Kenyon's first known publication was a 1904 magazine article entitled "A Sierra Summer", which appeared in "Out West—A Magazine of the Old Prairie and the New", and was included in a hardbound collection of issues, Volume XXI, July–December 1904. Her next known publication was of a poem, "Departures," which appeared in McClure's magazine in 1910. In the period from April 1917 to November 1918, she published six stories in magazines, as follows: in "Munsey's Magazine", March, 1917, her short story "The Second Generation" appeared. In "Sunset" magazine, April 1917, the short story "Tuesday" was published. In "Sunset" Magazine, May 1917, her short story "The Runaways" appeared. Her story "Treasure From The Sea" appeared in the October 1917 "Sunset" magazine. A two-part short story, "Nanny and her Lordship," appeared in the "Sunset" magazines for September and October, 1918. In November, 1918, her story "The Camofleurs" was published in "Sunset" Magazine, which during this period was headquartered in San Francisco.
In April 1923, a novella of hers entitled "The House In The Hollow" was published in "Munsey's Magazine". This mystery and romance story is set in the fictional California coastal town of Briones, and is told in the third person.
In addition to the works listed above, a 1933 novel entitled "Dark Hollow" was published in England by Grayson and Grayson, with the author given as Camilla Kenyon. It has not so far been established whether this later work is by the same Camilla Kenyon who was the author of "Spanish Doubloons" and "Fortune At Bandy's Flat".
No verifiable information on the life of Camilla Kenyon the author is available. (Note that there was an American painter of the same name. She is a different individual). Some websites regarding magazine fiction stories of the early 1900s state that Camilla Kenyon was born in San Francisco in 1876, but there is no factual confirmation currently available for this point.

Untitled (How Does It Feel)

"Untitled (How Does It Feel)" is a song by American recording artist D'Angelo, released January 1, 2000 on Virgin Records in the United States. It was issued as a radio single in promotion of his second studio album, "Voodoo" (2000). Written and produced by D'Angelo and Raphael Saadiq, the song was originally composed as a tribute to musician Prince. "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" contains a vintage style and sound similar to that of Prince's early musical work. The song's lyrics concern a man's plea to his lover for sex.
The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics and it earned D'Angelo a number of awards. "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" also earned notice for its controversial music video. Directed by Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, the video consists entirely of one shot featuring a muscular D'Angelo appearing nude and lip-synching to the track. While initial reaction from viewers was divided with praise for its sexuality and accusations of sexual objectification, the video received considerable airplay on music video networks such as MTV and BET, and it helped increase mainstream notice of D'Angelo and "Voodoo".
The music video for "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" had a considerable impact on D'Angelo's recording career, as it helped engender an image of him as a sex icon to a younger generation of fans. However, his discontent with this image led to his period of absence from the music scene following the conclusion of the supporting tour for "Voodoo". The song won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. "Rolling Stone" magazine named "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" the fourth best single of 2000. The magazine later named it the fifty-first best song of the 2000s (decade).
Background and recording.
"Untitled (How Does It Feel)" was originally intended as a tribute to influential musician Prince. The song evokes Prince's earlier work, in particular his balladry, from his , as well as his musical style and falsetto vocal technique. As an homage to the musician, Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson, record producer for "Voodoo", described the song as "finding the line between parody and honesty ... In an era of 'the cover song', redoing a Prince song was taboo. This is the second best thing". Production of the song was handled by D'Angelo and fellow neo soul musician Raphael Saadiq, who also contributed with bass and musical arrangements during recording in 1999. The session took place at Electric Lady Studios, the recording studio originally built by influential rock musician Jimi Hendrix.
Composition.
Musical structure.
"Untitled (How Does It Feel)" follows a six eight signature, while drum pattern, bass line, guitar and melodic phrasing feature traditional arrangements. Chalmers Alford's electric guitar interplay throughout the song is reminiscent of the guitar style of Jimi Hendrix, as well as the "Maggot Brain" sound featured on the early work of Funkadelic. The song features a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic, which gives the impression of a live drummer playing in accordance to the sound of a drum machine. Overdubbing of D'Angelo's vocals, a contemporary R&B recording technique prominently used on the rest of "Voodoo", was implemented a number of times during production in order to provide the sound of a choir singing harmonies during the choruses, all of which are sung by D'Angelo. 
The song begins with drummer Questlove's off-beat, cross-snare clicks on the two and four beat with a messy kick. Music critic Steve McPherson noted that its first two measures sound "like a disaster", contrasting its solid groove. While most musical compositions rely on tension and release, which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses, gradual buildup, sublte tension within verses or over the course of the bridge, or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation, D'Angelo's arrangements subdivide the tension into each moment of the song. According to McPherson, this results in "no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can't be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way. For lack of a less cliched word, it's entirely 'feel'". Similar to most of the song's album, "Voodoo", "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" has this syncopation style as its center. D'Angelo's casual vocal style follows the same concept, applying it to melody, harmony, and phrasing, and is accompanied by falsetto climbs and skittery phrasing similar to Prince's singing. 
Prior to the final chorus section, "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" features a song-spanning dynamic after the bridge and guitar break that is accompanied by minor Rhodes piano and guitar chords, while the multi-tracked vocals are implemented as background whispers. Arrangements for the song are stripped back for an emphasis on vocals, leading to an enormous choral climax accompanied by overdriven electric guitar. On the song's final chorus section, critic Steve McPherson wrote "after it hits a peak, it keeps rising, the chorus of voices fizzing into overdrive and the whole track gradually succumbing to a wash of reverb". The song is cut off in the middle of its culmination, ending with the line "How does it fee-". ()
Lyrics and theme.
Co-written by D'Angelo and producer Raphael Saadiq, "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" features sexually-explicit lyrics that follow and narrate a man's plea to his love interest for sex, as demonstrated in the song's second verse: "Love to make you wet / In between your thighs, cause / I love when it comes inside of you / I get so excited when I'm around you, baby". The song's lyrics have been described as "generic pop lyrics". Music critic Andy Peterson described the lyrics as "not–so–subtle", citing the line "Baby close the door / Listen girl, I have something I wanna show you / I wish you’d open up cause I wanna take the walls down with you" as an example. Music journalist Greg Levine cited its lyrics as ""the" generic pop lyrics", while also noting the similarity the lyrics have to those of other classic soul ballads, stating "Each line seems to be directly lifted from Marvin Gaye, Prince, or Curtis Mayfield." Levine elaborated on the lyrical theme of the song:
Release and reception.
As the fourth single issued in promotion of D'Angelo's second studio album "Voodoo", "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" featured release in the United Kingdom in 1999 through the EMI record label and in the United States on January 1, 2000 through Virgin Records. In 2000, a 12-inch vinyl release of the single was issued in the U.K. with distribution through EMI. The 12-inch single was released with cover artwork featuring an illustration of musician Jimi Hendrix and an upper caption reading "Electric Lady Studios", serving as an homage to the musician and the recording studio, which were both influential to D'Angelo during the production of "Voodoo". "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" proved to be the greatest chart success of the album's five radio singles, as it peaked at number 25 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and at number 2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. The single entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singes & Tracks on January 8, 2000 at number 65 and spent twenty-two consecutive weeks on the chart. On January 22, "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" entered the Hot 100 Singles at number 77 and spent seventeen weeks on the chart. 
The song was well received by music critics. Miles Marshall Lewis of "The Village Voice" commented on its Prince influence, stating "D's falsetto plays the "Do Me Baby"-era chocolate-seduction Prince role", while Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters described the song as "simply the best Prince song since his "Diamonds and Pearls" days". Neal cited "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" as the best track featured on "Voodoo", and praised D'Angelo's style, stating "arguably Prince has never sounded better channeled through D'Angelo." On the song, Andy Peterson of "The GW Hatchet" wrote that "D’Angelo does a great impression of old-school Prince, full of kinky keyboards, grinding guitars and not-so-subtle lyrics." In citing it one of the Greatest Make-Out Songs of All Time, "Blender" magazine wrote that D'Angelo "set the pace for bump 'n' grind in the Aughts. A high point for dippin' it low". Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson called it "the best Prince song Prince never wrote" and cited the song's climb to its final chorus section as "the finest musical approximation of sexual climax since Serge Gainsbourg's 'Je T'Aime, Moi Non Plus'".
Accolades.
In 2001, "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and was also nominated for Best R&B Song at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony. It was ranked number 12 on "The Village Voice"s 2000 Pazz & Jop critics' poll and number 4 on "Rolling Stone"s "End of Year Critics & Readers Poll" of the top singles of 2000. "Blender" ranked "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" number 454 on its list of the Top 500 Songs of the 80s-00s (2005), and "Q" included it on its list of the 1010 Songs You Must Own (2004). About.com writer Mark Edward Nero ranked it number 9 on his list of 20 Best R&B and Soul Songs of the 2000s decade. In its December 2009 issue, "Rolling Stone" ranked it number 51 on its list of the 100 Best Songs of the Decade. In September 2011, VH1 ranked "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" number 83 on its list of the 100 Greatest Songs of the '00s.
Music video.
Production.
The song's music video was directed and produced in one day at a soundstage in New York City by director Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, D'Angelo's manager at the time. The project was originally designed as a part of Trenier's promotional strategy to transform D'Angelo's image and public appeal. On the video's concept, Trenier stated, "the idea was, it would feel like one-on-one with whoever the woman was." D'Angelo, who had been under intense physical workout with personal trainer Mark Jenkins, was initially anxious to appear naked in the video upon hearing Trenier's proposal. In a 2008 interview for "Spin", Jenkins discussed D'Angelo's reluctance at the time to the idea for the video, stating "You've got to realize, he'd never looked like that before in his life. To somebody who was so introverted, and then, in a matter of three or four months, to be so ripped-everything was happening so quickly."
The video features a chiseled and muscular D'Angelo, wearing a small gold-chained crucifix necklace, lip-synching while filmed on a platform from the waist-up and appearing nude; he was wearing a pair of pajama bottoms during filming, which were not visible in the video as they were hung low away from the camera's view. Trenier later explained the idea of D'Angelo appearing alone, stating "We didn't want an on-screen love interest. We wanted him to be able to make contact with whoever was watching it one-on-one". Consisting of entirely one shot, the music video begins with the camera opening on the back of D'Angelo's head before rotating to the front and drawing back to a larger view of his upper torso, as he begins to lip-synch to the track, set to an all-black background. It continues with camera close-ups of sweat trickling from his tattooed arms, chiseled chest and abdominal muscles, while also flirting with a peak of his shadowed, muscular hip. The video leads to D'Angelo making emotional gestures as he lip-synchs to the choral climax and the end of the song.
Interpretations.
Music writers offered various interpretations of the video's style and concept. David Peisner of "Spin" wrote of the close-ups featured in the music video, "As the camera sucks him in, it feels intimate and intrusive, revealing and voyeuristic". Music critic Jim Farber commented that D'Angelo's torso "sways in grinding rhythm, tensing and releasing as his mouth curls in pleasure and his eyebrows narrow to measure an ecstatic contraction", while claiming that the video has "nothing but close-ups of D'Angelo's buff body on the apparent receiving end of one of life's great payoffs". In his essay "'Untitled': D'Angelo and the Visualization of the Black Male Body" for his 1999 "Wide Angle" journal, journalist Keith M. Harris interprets the video to be a portrayal of D'Angelo's "discursive play with masculinity and blackness". In his review of D'Angelo's "Voodoo", Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters wrote of the video in contrast to most music videos in R&B and hip hop at the time, stating "One could call the video for 'Untitled (How Does it Feel)' narcissistic, but in an era when most R&B videos are nothing but 'bling, bling' and booty, D'Angelo's bare naked torso was refreshing". On the video's camera range and angle, Stephen Hill, a senior vice president for BET, had stated "It stopped just north of the line where, you know, we would have had issues". A 2008 press release for D'Angelo described the music video as "featuring D'Angelo as a shirtless Adonis that catapulted him into the stratosphere and firmly cemented his place as the reigning King of Soul."
Initial reaction.
The music video gained a significant amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D'Angelo upon the release of "Voodoo" in January 2000. Viewer response to the "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" music video was largely divided along sexual lines, as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video. Additionally, D'Angelo's video appearance, including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen, contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video. For an April 2000 article for "Vibe", Questlove interviewed D'Angelo and asked him "Are you getting head in that video?", after which D'Angelo responded by laughing. Questlove then asked "So you're not going to answer that?", and D'Angelo responded, "No". Television personality Star Jones, former co-host of the Emmy Award-winning American talk show "The View", elaborated on the video's intimate theme, stating "D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an intimate situation with a man, that's really all that's there — the voice and the body and the light hitting the body in a way that makes you know that this is your man". Danyel Smith, editor for Time Inc. at the time, said "It's so sexy. It's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they're listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had to just sit there and endure." In an interview for "The New York Times", Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video. She continued, recalling her experience at a salon where the video was viewed, stating:
Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, reaction from most male viewers was negative. The music video was presented to a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea, New York nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of "Voodoo"s January 2000 release. According to a "New York Times" correspondent, one female viewer at the party "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't want to see that gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for "The New York Times" in 2000, stating "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do we have to look at that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for "The New York Times", D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".
Critical response.
Critical opinion of the music video was generally favorable. "Entertainment Weekly"s columnist Jim Farber gave the music video an A rating, and called the close-ups of D'Angelo's physique a "measure of the video's smarm-free joy that even though the camera puts the viewer in the pleasure-giving position, we feel in no way manipulated or debased". Farber also lauded the video's depiction of sexuality, stating "it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality. Was it good for you, too?". A columnist for "Billboard" magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video, writing that "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year". However, David Thigpen of "Time" magazine criticized the vanity of the video, stating "It's a good song, but I thought he was preening pretty heavily in the video". Thigpen also compared it to the music video for singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's "Thank U" (1998), which features Morissette appearing nude, and stated "Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability — that was the point of the Alanis Morissette video. But in this case, it's really about power, an in-your-face form of masculinity". Douglas Century of "The New York Times" called it "the most controversial music video to air in years", and favored the video's unconventional concept, writing that "'Untitled' breaks a long-established pattern in hip-hop and R&B videos in which male artists are often dressed in roughneck gear — baggy jeans, Timberland boots and baseball caps — surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis".
On September 7, 2000, the video earned four VMA nominations at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, which included MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, Best Male Video, Best R&B Video, and Best Direction. In 2001, the video was ranked number 44 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Videos. The website UGO later selected it for its list of the Top 50 Sexiest Music Videos. The digital television MTV Base named "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" number 18 on its list of the Top 100 Greatest Music Videos Ever. In selecting the video for its list of the 100 Awesome Music Videos, Pitchfork Media staff reviewer Amy Phillips wrote of the music video, stating "Every time a man that fine gets naked on TV, we're one step closer to world peace."
Legacy and influence.
The success of the video proved to contribute significantly to the album's commercial performance, as "Voodoo" had initially struggled to gain single-oriented success prior to the video. The commercial impact of the video and its heavy rotation on music video networks, however, lead to D'Angelo's building image as a sex icon to a younger generation of music fans. Despite the publicity surrounding "Voodoo" being escalated by the video's appeal, the appeal of the album was almost overshadowed, commercially, by the video. The video's success also lead to mounting frustrations during the supporting tour for "Voodoo", during which female fans and audience members would yell out for D'Angelo to take his clothes off on stage. Dominique Trenier, who served as D'Angelo's manager from 1996 to 2005, later explained his disappointment of the music video's effect on D'Angelo, stating "to this day, in the general populace's memory, he's the naked dude". 
Many of D'Angelo's peers have noted the success of the "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" music video as a contributing factor to his period of absence from the music scene and solo work, as well as his legal controversies and drinking issues following the tour. A columnist for SoulBounce.com has cited the video as the "jump-the-shark moment" for D'Angelo, and stated "It was so provocative and polarizing that no one could recover from it, least of all him". Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson, who served as producer for "Voodoo" and musical director for "The Voodoo Tour", discussed the music video's impact on D'Angelo in a 2003 interview with music journalist Touré, stating "he wants is to get fat. He doesn’t want his braider braiding every nook and cranny of his hair. He doesn’t wanna have to have ripples in his stomach. He doesn’t want the pressure of being 'Untitled' the video". Questlove ended by stating "Had he known what the repercussions of 'Untitled' would've been, I don’t think he would've done it".

Ramblin' Gamblin' Man (song)

"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man" is a song written and performed by Bob Seger (as the Bob Seger System). The song was originally released as a single in February 1968, then as a track on the album of the same name in April 1969. The single fared extremely well, reaching No.17 on the national charts. The original studio version, released in mono, had been unavailable to the public until it was included on Seger's 2011 compilation album "".
Production.
The song follows a I-VII-IV-I progression, a typical 1960s chord progression. The melody plays over a basic rock drum beat and an unmistakable organ riff that carry throughout the song. Seger's friend Glenn Frey, who later founded the Eagles, played acoustic guitar and sang back-up vocals.
Live.
The Bob Seger System synched to this song on a 1960s TV show called "Happenin"', hosted by Paul Revere. The clip exists on YouTube. Seger continued playing the song in concert with many various bands long after the Bob Seger System disbanded. A live version of the song from an Orlando concert on May 13, 1973 exists on www.worj.com. This version features Seger's (apparently unreliable) "Borneo Band", with prominent female vocalist Shaun Murphy (then known as Stoney). Another live version appeared on the 1976 live album "Live Bullet", this time with the Silver Bullet Band backing Seger. The song finally dropped off of Seger's set list in 1983, but returned 23 years later during Seger's 2006-07 "Face The Promise" tour.
Artists such as Gov't Mule and Bruce Springsteen have also covered this song in concert.
In popular culture.
The song was used in the 2001 comedy "Joe Dirt".

New Order of Cincinnatus

The New Order of Cincinnatus (NOOC) was a young men's political organization established in Seattle, Washington in the 1930s. The short-lived "conservative and moralistic reform group" was a municipal party that challenged both the Democratic and Republican parties, electing David Lockwood (in 1934) and Frederick G. Hamley, a lawyer, public official and judge, and Arthur Langlie (in 1935) to the Seattle City Council. Lockwood, age 26 at the time of his election, was the youngest person ever to sit on the council. In 1938, Langlie became Seattle mayor, but by then the NOOC was fading. During its brief existence, the group spread beyond Seattle, and was active in Tacoma, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and San Francisco.
The nature of NOOC.
An outgrowth of Seattle's non-partisan Municipal League, named for the Roman farmer and statesman Cincinnatus, the NOOC was founded in September 1933 by approximately 10 young men including Seattle attorney Ralph Bushnell Potts. Potts, who Richard C. Berner describes as the "prime mover and first commander" of the NOOC, had resigned from the presidency of the Consolidated Republican Clubs of King County to start the group. The NOOC's idealistic, mostly middle-class professional supporters reacted against both political corruption and labor unionism. They required the candidates they supported to disaffiliate from the established political parties and to limit campaign contributions to US$25. A May 1934 NOOC leaflet called for a "rebirth of political idealism among the younger citizens of America… he major political parties have become nothing but job-hunting cliques… Cincinnatus advocates a Spartan-like devotion to honesty, efficiency, and ability in government." The group called for a reduction of 40% in Seattle city taxes, in a context where the city had already made large cuts: by the time the NOOC had a significant foothold on the city council, opposing councilman James Scavotto could argue that the city had already cut operating costs 50% in five years.
The NOOC also advocated a vastly increased state-level police constabulary, with no intermediate levels between the state and municipalities. This police force would consist entirely of men under age 40, trained by a State Police School, and enlisting for a military-style four-year term rather than being free to resign at any time.
The NOOC restricted its membership to men ages 21 to 35, and was organized along military lines to the point of resembling a fascist organization. By December 1933, Potts had built the NOOC into an organization with 17 divisions in Washington State each headed by a "captain"; statewide officers were "majors" and "colonels". In early 1934, 50 Cincinnatans marched to city hall to file three candidate petitions for city council, all of them dressed in white shirts and green and yellow headpieces (the colors of Seattle's Roosevelt High School). They used a slightly rewritten version of Sigmund Romberg's "Stout Hearted Men" as their anthem. This "proto-fascist" style was a matter of tension within the organization from the outset. NOOC councilman Frederick Hamley's diary indicates that he and his fellow councilman David Lockwood generally disliked this aspect of the group and focused mainly on local municipal issues. In February 1934 they and others defeated a proposal that the members of the organization should routinely stand and salute Potts when he entered the room.
History in Seattle.
1934.
NOOC formed in September 1933. The next month they demanded the resignation of King County Commissioner John C. Stevenson (born John C. Stockman). Stevenson had avoided extradition to New York, where he was wanted for stock fraud; the NOOC further accused him of mismanagement of the county relief. They failed, but the attention gained encouraged them to run candidates for public office themselves. David Lockwood, Wellington Rhinehart, and Lloyd Johnson filed to run in the February 1934 primaries. Their total campaign budget was less than US$600.
Seattle City Council offices are officially nonpartisan, and there is no official acknowledgment or a party or ticket. These three NOOC candidates in 1934 got around this by all listing "Cincinnatus" as their middle names on the ballot, which the election officials permitted. In this period, three of the nine Seattle City Council positions were up for election each year, with the top six candidates in the primary election going on to a general election.
The NOOC candidates were supported by the Washington Taxpayers Council, as was conservative incumbent John E. Carroll. Of the Cincinnatans, only Lockwood made it through the primaries, but he gained office despite a complete lack of newspaper endorsements, coming in second in the general election. He took office in June amidst the Maritime Strike of 1934, which had led to lethal violence in Seattle.
Elected mayor at the same time Lockwood joined the council was Charles William Smith. Smith and his police chief, W. B. Kirtley, undoubtedly tolerated Seattle's then-longstanding police corruption. Lockwood further accused Smith of profiting personally from this corruption and tied Smith's toleration of corruption to his toleration of a growing budget deficit. Among the remedies he proposed were a fixed term for police chiefs, making the chief more independent of the mayor (and thereby separating the mayor from any system of police payoffs).
Carried away by their success in Seattle and the interest in forming other chapters around the state, the NOOC contested the statewide November elections. Among their candidates were William J. Wilkins for U. S. Senate, Cecil R. Fuller for the 1st District congressional seat, and John W. Day for King County Prosecutor. Running with great enthusiasm but very little budget, they did not elect anyone, but did have the best third-party results of any slate since the Bull Moosers in 1912.
1935.
In the 1935 election, the NOOC ran only two candidates for the three available city council seats, endorsing former PTA president Mildred Powell for the third seat. Originally the two NOOC candidates were to be Frederick Hamley and Leo Mortland, but the latter was a bit too enthusiastic in identifying as a Republican. When he gleefully announced his endorsement by the 36th District Republican Club, the NOOC decided he was no longer their candidate and replaced him with Arthur Langlie (although Langlie was never an official member of the NOOC).
Incumbents William Gaines, Frank Fitts, and David Levine chose to campaign jointly, with the backing of the Central Labor Council and the newly formed Washington Commonwealth Federation. They accused the NOOC of being a "secret organization" and intending to impose a "fascist dictatorship". Nonetheless, Langlie and Frederick Hamley led in the primaries, followed by the incumbents; the sixth candidate was the NOOC-endorsed Powell. This time, Langlie and Hamley gained the endorsements of all three major dailies. Of the incumbents, only Levine secured any such endorsement, from the "Seattle Star". Langlie and Hamley came in as the top two in the general election. Powell was also elected. It was Levine's only defeat in a political career lasting more than three decades. Because of some resignations, Langlie and Hamley took office immediately after the election.
Secure in the knowledge that they needed only one other council vote to override any mayoral veto, the three NOOC council members used these council positions to investigate corruption and to reduce city spending. Lockwood updated proposals he already had for a central purchasing office and a central garage; he also framed a response to municipally owned Seattle City Light's proposal to buy out the Seattle operations of the Puget Sound Power and Light Company, which the NOOC opposed. Hamlie and Langlie were assigned to investigate the city's street railway system, which was in chronic financial trouble, and the police department. As they turned up substantial evidence of police corruption, it became clear that Powell would also be interested in proposals to reform the police. The council voted 5 to 4 for a budget that would cut 120 city jobs, mainly in the police and fire departments and public schools. Mayor Smith vetoed this, and his veto was sustained because Powell opposed the school cuts. The city budget was put on hold until September.
Meanwhile, the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" attacked Mayor Smith for running a "wide open" city, for refusing to make cuts in the departments controlled by the mayor's office, for being associated with a corrupt police-based political machine, and for a recent upsurge in illegal gambling, prostitution, and Sunday liquor sales. The "P-I" was not alone in these views: "The Argus" compared Smith to the legendarily corrupt Hiram Gill and the United States Navy made it known that they were considering placing the entire city of Seattle off limits for sailors on leave. Further condemnations of this state of affairs came from the Clean Government League, the Morals Committee of the Council of Churches, and the "Philippine-American Chronicle", which published detailed exposes of the "Chinese Gambling Syndicate" and the police's policy of closing down only the "small fry".
In hearings, Chief W. B. Kirtley argued that the police were expending a great deal of effort dealing with numerous labor strikes and could hardly stand staff cuts. He acknowledged that the police made a "liberal construction" of city ordinances but said that he opposed "fanatical enforcement of the laws". He hinted broadly that some of the pillars of the church who opposed gambling actually profited from it as landlords, and might not be pleased with zealous enforcement. When talked of the material difficulty of raiding gambling dens (which usually had effective routes of escape), the Cincinnatans insisted on his accompanying them out of the hearing room to the openly operating Battersby and Smith's card room near First Avenue and Madison Street. Kirtley could hardly deny the evidence in front of his eyes: he ordered police to trash the establishment and to confiscate the money. None of the confiscated money ever made it to the police evidence room.
1936 and after.
All of this was dramatic, but had few concrete results. A five-year term was established for the position of police chief. Token arrests were made in gambling and vice, but the wave soon passed. In January 1936, 60 positions were cut from the department and three precinct stations closed, but the cuts were overturned in the spring elections, which did not go well for the NOOC. In a complicated mayoral election amidst shifting alliances, Langlie lost the general election to former mayor John Dore, whom Smith had bested in 1934. Although Dore in his previous term had responded to the onset of the Great Depression by cutting many city jobs and reduced wages, he now promised a reversal of these policies. This and other promises gained him the backing of organized labor in general and Dave Beck of the Teamsters Union in particular. The all-round labor victory also returned David Levine to the city council. Dore announced, "This election means the end of fascist, semi-military organizations and of dictatorship in Seattle." Conversely, it brought to power a labor-based political machine.
Lockwood lost his council seat in the 1937 elections. Langlie, meanwhile, set his sights again on the mayoralty. Amidst a city fiscal crisis and a complete lack of aid from the state government of Governor Clarence D. Martin, The chaotic election of 1938 saw Langlie faced off against an ailing Dore (who spent most of the campaign period in the hospital, with his son John, Jr. acting as campaign spokesman) and the flamboyant Vic Meyers, a locally famous jazz musician and bandleader who had backed into politics as a joke candidate in 1932, but who after becoming increasingly serious about the matter had become lieutenant governor. Meyers, allied with the industrial unionists, including the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), opposed Dore from the left, Langlie from the right. Initially the main thrust of his campaign was an attack on the Dore/Beck alliance, which he accused of amounting to "racketeering". This "'racket' talk" did not go over well with the "Argus" or the city's business community, who were in general happy with the collaborationist truce that had suspended Seattle's long labor war, and who also saw this rhetoric as bad for the city's image in the eyes of the rest of the country. Courting their support, Langlie toned down this rhetoric and re-focused on NOOC's tax-cutting agenda and the city's agenda. Meanwhile, he plotted with the Municipal League against Meyers: their intent was to disqualify Meyers by showing that he had not paid Seattle city taxes during his stint in Olympia (the state capital), but to hold back this attack until such time as it would be too late for another candidate of the same faction to enter the race. Dore attacked Meyers as well, red-baiting him and the CIO by tying them to the Communist Party (CPUSA). In the primary Langlie won big and Dore lost big: Langlie garnered 51,175 votes, Meyers 27,436, Dore 21,480; an additional candidate, William Norton, took 10,457 votes, leaving Langlie to face Meyers in the general election.
A resounding, unsolicited Communist endorsement for Meyers in the general election as the "New Deal candidate" running against a "reactionary" entirely backfired against Meyers and even Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and left the CIO and the Washington Commonwealth Federation (WCF) looking like communist fronts. Langlie won 80,149 to 48,563. The gravely ill Dore was relieved of his office by the city council on April 13, 1938 (and died five days later); Langlie began his term early. In the wake of Langlie's election, Governor Martin finally came to the city's financial aid, so Langlie expected to face a lesser fiscal crisis than his predecessor. This was, however, balanced or overbalanced by state Social Security Board administrator Charles F. Ernst cutting the relief rolls by 20%, removing over 12,000 Seattleites (and at least 8,000 elsewhere in King County) during one of the harshest periods of the Depression. In office, Langlie immediately overturned a rule that garbage collectors would be paid the prevailing wage. This was the first of a series of Seattle wage cuts (and strikes), most won by employers including the city government. Over the next year, Langlie continued to fight against the power of labor in general and the Teamsters in particular and also revived the NOOC's fight against police corruption, but had to focus mainly on solving Seattle's financial crisis. Among his successes was the resolution of the longstanding crisis over the city's streetcar system: he obtained a US$10.2 million federal grant to pay off the debts and replace the entire system with a network of buses and trackless trolleybuses. He had the good fortune that the start of World War II in Europe led to a rise in defense production, from which Seattle benefitted greatly. He also obtained federal funding to build the Ballard Bridge and West Seattle Viaduct and to repair recreational facilities. In short, he succeeded in running his fiscally conservative administration by obtaining funds from the liberal Democratic federal government.
By 1939 the NOOC had disbanded and Langlie formally identified as Republican. He easily won re-election as mayor in spring 1940, and, as the Republican candidate, won the state governorship in the November 1940 election.
The San Francisco chapter.
The San Francisco chapter of the NOOC was founded by Pat Brown, later Democratic Governor of California, in 1935. It completely lacked the Seattle chapter's militaristic tendencies, but shared its call for an end to "partisan bickering". It quickly gained over 500 members and established a headquarters on Market Street. The San Francisco chapter soon launched an effort towards the ousting of incumbent members on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, seeking to root out the corruption of those on the Board. After offering enforcement and assistance to a group of rival candidates, the chapter was successful in deposing four of the bureaucrats on the Board and in placing one of their own candidates (Dewey Meade) on the Board. Its main long-term political effect was to bring Brown to prominence.
Other chapters.
In addition to Seattle and San Francisco, among the towns and cities that had Cincinnatus chapters were Bellingham, Bremerton, Chehalis, Everett, Kirkland, Spokane, Tacoma, and Wenatchee, all in Washington; and Portland, Oregon.

Jackson Niyomugabo (born 18 April 1988) is a Rwandan Olympic swimmer. He is originally from Kibuye in Rwanda's western region. He grew up swimming in the waters of Lake Kivu on the border between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. His father died early in Jackson's life, and Jackson found strength from his mother who farms the family's small plot of land in the mountains above Lake Kivu.
Lake Kivu is famous for beautiful views and mountaintop islands. Jackson Niyomugabo's humble background did not afford him opportunities for extensive professional training. He learned to swim from reading a book provided to him from a high school teacher. He built endurance and stamina by swimming between the mountain top islands in the lake, and was occasionally granted permission to swim in a tourist hotel in the capital, Kigali.
Jackson Niyomugabo competed in the 2007 World Aquatics Championship in Australia, although he did not win a medal. He represented the Republic of Rwanda in swimming during the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Madisonville is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio.
History.
Madisonville was established in 1809 and originally named Madison after the newly elected James Madison, the fourth president of the United States. Prior to 1809, European-American settlers began to arrive in the territory, mostly from the mid-Atlantic and New England states. In 1826, the post office was named Madisonville, in order to avoid confusion with other towns.
The first permanent setter was Joseph Ward, a sixty-five-year-old American Revolutionary War veteran from New Jersey. Joseph and his two sons, Usual and Israel, came overland by horseback intending to settle in the new outpost of Columbia. Joseph's wife, Phebia, and other sons and daughters traveled by flatboat down the Ohio River to reunite at Columbia.
Seeing the flooding at that location, they decided to go up higher and settled in what was to become Madisonville. Joseph and his sons built the first house, a log cabin, in 1797 along an old Indian trail near what is now Whetsel and Monning Avenue.
In 1830, the population of the village was 284. In 1900, the population of Madisonville was reported to be 3,140. Madisonville was annexed by the City of Cincinnati in 1911.

<doc id="18780840" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18780840" title="Sussex Marble">
Sussex Marble

Sussex Marble is a fossiliferous freshwater limestone material which is prevalent in the Weald Clay of parts of Kent, East Sussex and West Sussex in southeast England. It is also called Petworth Marble, Bethersden Marble or Laughton Stone in relation to villages where it was quarried, and another alternative name is winklestone. It is referred to as "marble" as it polishes very well, although it is not a geologically described one as it has not been subject to metamorphosis. The matrix is made up of the shells of freshwater gastropods and "viviparus" winkles, similar to but larger than those making Purbeck Marble. The pale calcified remains of the shells are in a matrix of darker material. West Sussex has a good concentration of thin layers of Sussex Marble; beds typically measure no more than thick. There are often two beds—the lower formed of smaller-shelled gastropods than the upper—with a layer of calcareous clay between them.
Historical use.
The Weald of Kent, near the Sussex border, was the centre of quarrying activity, as the material was most prevalent there. Yeomen who owned their own farms were usually involved. Bethersden village is surrounded by "small reed-filled and tree-fringed ponds" formed by the filling over time of old marble workings. In the area, the Perpendicular Gothic towers of the parish churches of Biddenden, Headcorn, Smarden and Tenterden, pavements and paths in Staplehurst, and an inn next to Pluckley railway station all use the material.
In the early 19th century, Sussex Marble quarried at Petworth rivalled many of the stones which were routinely imported from the continent, in both beauty and quality. A kind of shell marble occurring in the Wealden clay, its quarrying was concentrated on the Egremont estate at Kirdford and there are accounts of industry at nearby Plaistow. It was used in several chimney pieces at Petworth House, and in Edward the Confessor's Chapel in Westminster Abbey the tombs of Edward III and of Richard II and his Queen are both in "grey Petworth Marble". At Canterbury Cathedral the Archbishop's chair is an entire piece of the stone. Embellishment of the nave of Chichester Cathedral is in both Purbeck and Petworth Marbles; the latter was used for the pillars of the upper triforium which even then showed "some decomposition of the shelly particles". Church fittings such as altars, rails, piers and floors have been made from the material, as have memorial tablets and parts of tombs. Sussex churches with Sussex Marble fonts include St George's at Trotton, St Peter's at Ardingly and St Mary's at West Chiltington. The lychgate at St Mary Magdalene's Church, Bolney, given to the church in 1905, stands on a base of Sussex Marble.
Present day.
As the material is not in regular supply, much restoration of earlier Sussex Marble work takes place using Purbeck Marble, which is considered a more stable stone. An example of this practice occurred as early as 1870, when the font at St Margaret's Church in West Hoathly had to be restored but the original Sussex Marble, quarried in Petworth, had run out.
The industry and workings are long gone although small new rural development around the Surrey/Sussex border occasionally brings up new seams of the stone. The qualities of the material are being rediscovered through British sculptors like Jon Edgar who, after a gap of nearly 200 years, are having to re-discover the ways of working it, its strengths and weaknesses.

Audric del Vilar

Aldric or Audric del Vilar was the twelfth-century lord of Auvillar and a troubadour. According to the "vida" of Marcabru, he raised the young Marcabru. This may in fact be derived by Marcabru's biographer from an exchange of satiric songs betweent he two, beginning with Audric's "Tot a estru" (16b.1), to which Marcabru responded with "Seigner n'Audric" (293.43). Audric may have been originally writing in response to Marcabru's "gap" "D'aisso lau Dieu". The whole exchange revolves around Marcabru's claim that he will accept bread from a fool so long as it lasts. On the other hand, both of Marcabru's pieces, which share Audric's metrical form, may be responses to Audric. Audric introduced the nickname "Pan-Perdut" (Breadless) for Marcabru.

Citizens for East Shore Parks

Citizens for East Shore Parks (CESP) is an American environmental organization that focuses on the acquisition and preservation of parkland in the San Francisco Bay Area. CESP works to protect open space along the East Bay shoreline for natural habitat and recreational purposes through a combination of advocacy, education, and outreach. Since its founding in 1985, CESP has worked to secure approximately of public land, primarily through the creation of the long Eastshore State Park in 2002.
Mission statement.
The mission of Citizens for East Shore Parks (CESP) is to preserve and enhance the natural resources and recreational and educational opportunities of the east shore of San Francisco Bay, creating a necklace of shoreline parks from the Oakland Estuary to the Carquinez Strait.
Organization.
CESP has a twenty-five member volunteer Board of Directors, including prominent community members, environmentalists, and public officials who have a long record of working on behalf of environmental issues in the East Bay. They include Tom Bates, Robert Cheasty, Shirley Dean, Whitney Dotson, Norman La Force, and Sylvia McLaughlin, among others. Most board members also sit on subcommittees addressing specific environmental or operational issues.
Although the scope of its work is large, CESP operates with a very small staff. There is one executive director who manages day-to-day affairs, as well as interns and volunteers.
History.
CESP was founded in 1985 to oppose Santa Fe Railroad’s proposals for large-scale development at the Berkeley and Albany waterfront. Historically, CESP grew from the wider movement among East Bay residents to protect San Francisco Bay and its shoreline from capricious and irresponsible development. A coalition of local environmentalists, public officials, and concerned individuals banded together to form Citizens for the Eastshore State Park, with the original goal of creating a state park that would permanently and strategically preserve the shoreline for public and recreational use.
By 1990, Albany, Berkeley, and Emeryville residents had overwhelmingly approved ballot measures to protect the remaining open space on the shoreline. With its plans stymied, Santa Fe Railroad became interested in selling the land. Citizens for the Eastshore State Park played an important role in the park planning process. CESP helped draft two successful bond measures that would eventually enable the California Department of State Parks and the East Bay Regional Park District to acquire the land and administer the park. Moreover, CESP served as a forum for diverse groups and individuals to agree on a common vision for the shoreline park, as well as an intermediary between the public and public officials.
In December 2002, the California Department of State Parks unanimously approved the Eastshore State Park general plan. The Eastshore State Park opened in 2006, almost forty years after the vision of a shoreline park was first articulated. The long park spans the Berkeley, Oakland, Emeryville, Albany and Richmond waterfronts, and preserves more than of uplands and tidelands—also home to sixteen species of rare, threatened, or endangered wildlife.
In 2004, CESP changed its name from Citizens for the Eastshore State Park to Citizens for East Shore Parks in order to reflect its broader commitment to acquiring and preserving open space in the East Bay.
In 2006, CESP led a successful campaign to preserve the Albany shoreline from Magna Entertainment Corporation’s development efforts. The proposed shopping mall would have split the Eastshore State Park in two.
Leading up to it culmination in 2008, CESP joined with the local groups in Richmond to create a vision to protect the Richmond shoreline for open space, public access, habitat protection and recreation. CESP advocated for the direct acquisition of Breuner Marsh as part of the East Bay Regional Park system. As part of the North Richmond Shoreline Open Space Alliance, CESP urged the East bay Regional Park District to acquire the property. The East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) attempted to purchase the land from the landowner who instead announced intentions to build a development partly in the marsh, with the matter ending up in court finally and in 2008 the Court rule that the acquisition could go forward and put the price at $6.85 million. CESP and other environmental allies encouraged this acquisition to preserve and restore more than of the North Richmond Shoreline.
CESP played a pivotal role in the successful creation of the Tom Bates Regional Sports Complex, opened in 2008. CESP brought its allies together to successfully fight for the creation of a regional sports complex at the shoreline as an adjunct to the Eastshore State Park. CESP (with allies Sierra Club, Golden Gate Audubon and others) persuaded the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) of the advantages in buying a little-used lot on the shoreline from Golden Gate Fields in the middle of the Eastshore State Park. CESP worked to set in motion a massive cooperative effort among the five cities along the Eastshore State Park and the EBRPD, along with the dedicated hard work of many ballfield user groups, to push the project forward and finally to see its opening for play in 2008. The complex was named after CESP Vice President and Mayor of Berkeley Tom Bates, in recognition of his decades of consistent work in helping to create the Eastshore State Park and for his stalwart leadership among the five cites and the EBRPD in bringing this complex to completion.
Current projects.
CESP is currently focusing its efforts on two geographic areas: Eastshore State Park and Richmond.
Eastshore State Park.
CESP continues to support the development and operation of the Eastshore State Park, including habitat restoration and the creation of public amenities. One current project is construction of the long-overdue visitor’s center and park entrance at the proposed Brickyard site in Berkeley. Although a few issues (such as design and cost) remain unresolved, CESP has been working in conjunction with local and state park agencies to provide valued public input for the ongoing planning process.
CESP is involved with various habitat restoration projects. The Eastshore State Park General Plan mentions enhancing and restoring a number of ecosystems and habitat types throughout the park. The Berkeley Meadow is currently undergoing a long-term restoration project that will restore seasonal wetlands and create coastal scrub and native grasslands. The City of Albany and East Bay Regional Park District are undertaking a similar project at the Albany Plateau. Both projects will benefit threatened wildlife, such as the Northern Harrier, White-tailed Kite, and Western Burrowing Owl.
CESP is also staying abreast of developments in the Albany Waterfront Visioning Process. The Albany City Council is considering future alternative land uses for what is now the Golden Gate Fields racetrack, which occupies much of the waterfront, in the event that the racetrack closes. CESP is working with local residents to adopt a plan that would environmentally restore the site and incorporate it into the Eastshore State Park, while also addressing the need for responsible development.
Richmond.
The City of Richmond is currently updating its General Plan, which will determine land use options for the next 30 years. CESP is working to convince the City of Richmond to adopt a General Plan that secures and improves public access to Richmond’s of shoreline. CESP is also involved in a public outreach component designed to educate Richmond residents about the environmental, social, and economic benefits of public parks.
CESP’s vision for the Richmond shoreline consists of three parts. The first concerns the North Richmond Shoreline, which extends from Point Pinole to Wildcat Creek Marsh. Because of its rich ecological diversity and shoreline marshes, CESP calls for this part of the shoreline to be designated as parkland and open space, preventing any further development.
Another area of concern is Point San Pablo Peninsula, which includes Point Molate. The developer Upstream currently has plans to build a large-scale Indian casino and resort on this historic part of the shoreline, with far-reaching implications. The city of Richmond is considering a fast-track handover of the site to the developers for clean-up. CESP supports the creation of parkland along this shoreline rather than a casino complex.
On the South Richmond Shoreline, CESP is mainly concerned with the status of the Zeneca/Cherokee site and University of California's Richmond Field Station. Zeneca is one of the most toxic superfund sites in California. Beyond the immediate goal of achieving a comprehensive clean-up and restoration of the site, CESP opposes Cherokee-Simeon Ventures’ housing development plans for such a site and wants to incorporate the shoreline into the adjacent Eastshore State Park after appropriate clean-up.
Publications.
In 2007, Citizens for East Shore Parks published a brochure, "Our Vision for the North Richmond Shoreline", to make the case for parks and open space in Richmond.
In 2008, CESP began publishing a periodic newsletter entitled "Shore Lines", focusing on developments in the Eastshore State Park and Richmond.
Partnerships.
CESP has partnerships with more than a dozen local environmental organizations and foundations that share some of its basic objectives.

Héctor Feliciano

Hector Feliciano (born 1952) is a Puerto Rican journalist and author whose book ""The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art"" has shed light on an estimated 20,000 works of art plundered by the Nazis; each one is owned by a museum or a collector somewhere.
Early years.
Feliciano was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania of Puertorrican parents (Héctor and Nereida), while his father was concluding his MD residency. He was raised in San Juan, the capital city of Puerto Rico where he received his primary and secondary education, graduating form Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola. During the early part of his youth he became interested in studying art and culture, however his family expected him to follow his father's footsteps and study medicine.
Feliciano moved to Waltham, Massachusetts, and attended Brandeis University, earning in 1974 his Bachelor's degree in History and Art History. Feliciano earned his Masters in the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He then went to Paris and earned a doctorate in literature at the University of Paris while working for the city of Paris cultural affairs bureau.
He began his career as a cultural writer for the Paris bureau of the "Washington Post". In 1988, Feliciano was working on an article for the Paris bureau of the "Los Angeles Times" about a stolen Murillo painting that had been bought by the Louvre, when someone mentioned that 20 percent of the looted art during World War II is still missing. During the process of his reporting he realized that no one had ever asked the looted families about the situation.
Nazi art looting.
During the Third Reich, agents acting on behalf of the ruling Nazi Party of Germany organized the spoliation of art of European countries. The Nazis confiscated artworks from prominent Jewish collectors and from dealers whose galleries were taken over. Ordinary people, too, lost their art treasures when they left them behind in their homes, as they fled or were sent to concentration camps. The plundering occurred from 1933 until the end of World War II, although most of the plundered art was acquired during the war. Many of these items were recovered by the Allies immediately following the war, however many more are still missing.
"The Lost Museum".
Feliciano began the research for his book in 1989, using material from German looting inventories, documents that had been declassified and more than 200 interviews with art dealers, art historians and the surviving relatives of the families who were victimized. At first, Feliciano believed that the families involved would be hesitant to cooperate in his investigation, however the five families whose stories would be the core of the book, the Rothschilds, the Rosenbergs, the Bernheim-Jeunes, the David-Weills and the Schlosses trusted him with their records and their memories and other families welcomed him.
The French government ministries and museums refused to let Feliciano see their records and kept stalling until he was finally permitted to gain access through information requests lodged by the victims' families. Feliciano also had the help of someone from the Ministry of Culture who secretly provided him with documents sent from the Ministry of Culture to the Ministry of Justice which proved that the French museums mingled looted works with their collections. Feliciano had befriended a 92-year-old art dealer by the name of Alfred Daber who remembered all the wartime gossip in regard to the dealings that went on with the looted art. During his investigations Feliciano went to Washington, D.C. to work in the United States National Archives and discovered that Daber himself had been dealing in looted art.
In 1997, Feliciano published his book: "The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art". Feliciano tried to publish his book in the United States and was turned down by at least 30 publishers. He then went to a publishing house in France, where it was picked up almost immediately. In his book he traces the art works looted as they passed through the hands of top German officials, unscrupulous art dealers, and unwitting auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's. He also revealed that the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris was amongst the institutions in France and Switzerland that held works that had been seized from Jewish victims during the war by the Germans (these works are now referred to as Musées Nationaux Récupération or MNRs). 
Feliciano exposed the code utilized by the museum to keep track of the provenance of the works in the collection: "R" referred for "recuperation" and the number following it signified the order in which the work arrived at the museum. Feliciano charged the museum's curators with having "made no huge effort" to find the rightful owners for "thousands of unclaimed works". 
The book, which was first published in French, has since been translated into several other languages. After the book's successful European publication HarperCollins, a U.S. publishing house that had inititally turned it down (amongst 30 others), bought the U.S. publication rights. The book points out also the role of Switzerland, whose legislation is very favourable to dishonest dealers and Russia, which categorically refuses to give back the stolen works of art found in Germany at the end of WW2 to their legitimate owners.
Aftermath.
The French government had to increase efforts to find original owners (or their heirs) of the nearly 2,000 looted worksworks of arts stolen by nazi Germany. A Matisse painting titled "Oriental Woman Seated on Floor," was identified in the Seattle Art Museum as a piece that belonged to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg by someone who read the book. The Rosenberg family then laid claim to the painting. The "Paysage" (pictured), a 1911 Cubist landscape by Albert Gleizes at the Pompidou Center was identified by Hector Feliciano as having been looted by the Nazis from the home of collector Alphonse Kann during World War II. It was returned to the heirs of Alphonse Kann.
Families whose art collections were plundered by the Nazis are reclaiming prized paintings that have been found hanging in museums around the world. Auction houses have also stopped sales of works because their postwar sellers may have been thieves.
Neither Switzerland or Russia did anything in favour of the legitimate owners or their heirs.
Litigation.
In 1999, a French court rejected a claim for $1 million in damages brought by the Wildenstein family against Feliciano, who suggested in his book that the French-Jewish family did business with Nazi officials during Germany's wartime occupation of France. In the book Feliciano claims that the powerful dealer and collector did business with Nazi art dealers before the war and for months after France's occupation by Germany in June 1940. He also said that after Wildenstein went into exile in New York in January 1941, he maintained contacts with a former employee, Roger Duquoy, who ran the Paris gallery until 1944. The three-judge lower court stated the following in reaching their decision:
"The Lost Museum: the Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art," as well as new documents presented to the court, the judges said that "Hector Feliciano had in his hands elements that permitted him to believe that Georges Wildenstein maintained direct and indirect relations with German authorities during the occupation."
The family of the Parisian art dealer Paul Rosenberg recovered paintings by Matisse, Monet, Léger and Bonnard. In 2001, Feliciano sued the Rosenberg family alleging that Mrs. Rosenberg, the widow of Mr. Rosenberg's son, Alexandre had made an oral contract with him promising that she would compensate him for tracking down paintings that were returned to the family in recent years. Feliciano was asking a 17.5 percent of the estimated $39 million value of the paintings as a finders fee, however Mrs. Rosenberg denied she had an oral contract with Feliciano and said he had not been responsible for recovering the paintings. The case was dismissed by Justice Charles E. Ramos, a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan in February 2003.
Later years.
During the 1998-99 academic year, as part of the National Arts Journalism Program, Feliciano was one of fourteen journalists selected for a Journalism Fellowship by Columbia University, in which he specialized in arts and culture. He continued to live in Paris and was the editor in chief of "World Media Network", a newspaper syndicate serving 23 European newspapers. Feliciano worked as the director of the Ministry of Culture and the "Club des Poetes" in Paris before moving to New York City where he writes for "El Pais" and "Clarin".
Feliciano is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at New York University, and has served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled "The Art of the Enemy" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002). Feliciano is currently teaching an honors seminar on religious art at New York University.

West End, Cincinnati

West End is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio, located north-west of downtown, east of Queensgate, west of Over-the-Rhine, and south-east of Fairview. 
The historic West End was largely razed in the 1950s as part of a series of urban renewal projects, including the construction of Interstate 75.
The West End is the location of City West, the largest housing development project in Cincinnati since World War II. The project transformed the once low-income area into mixed-income development. In 1999 many of the blighted, cramped buildings were leveled to make way for new townhomes with ample parking. In 2007, part 1 crimes were down by 30% when compared to 1999.
Controversy erupted in 2005 when plans were announced to open a $15-million "one-stop" social services facility at 800 Bank Street. The project, known as CityLink, would be the largest such facility in Cincinnati. Some argued that it would increase crime and poverty in the West End, decrease property value, and undermine the redevelopment there. Some even accused the city of trying to relocate the poor from the thriving Over-the-Rhine neighborhood to the West End. However, proponents argued that the West End's central location makes it easy for the poor to access. A lawsuit to stop the CityLink project failed, as did the subsequent appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.
Cincinnati's West End neighborhood contains a large collection of historic properties, including the Dayton Street Historic District.

Bernal Heights Summit

Bernal Heights Summit or Bernal Heights Hill is a hill in San Francisco, California the neighborhood of Bernal Heights. Upper elevations are part of Bernal Hill Park, a component of San Francisco Recreation and Parks; a property at the highest elevation is privately owned and houses an equipment building and telecommunications tower, known among the local community as "Sutrito Tower." The park and summit are largely surrounded by Bernal Heights Boulevard.
Ecology.
There are a number of flora and fauna present on Bernal Hill. Wildflowers include such species as the Yellow Mariposa Lily.
Geology.
Bernal Hill, along with the other hills in the San Francisco area, is a folded hill, created by the "wrinkling up" effect of the Pacific plate subducting under the North American plate, when the North American and Pacific plates were converging, around 150 million years ago. Near the summit you will find folded layers of very hard rock called radiolarian chert. It is a sedimentary sillicate rock which gets its sillica content from the shells of microscopic creatures called radiolaria.The red color comes from iron oxide. In between the layers of chert are thinner layers of shale in many different colors from the same red as the surrounding rock to white, green and purple. Other types of rocks and minerals on the hill include serpeninite, jasper and clay.

The Kauai Railway is a former narrow gauge railway company in Hawaii, United States. It was created 1906 and operated a long railroad line with Two foot six inch gauge railways narrow gauge track from Port Allen,to Koloa and Kalaheo on the south coast of the island of Kauai. It did not have a connection to the other common carrier railway on the island, the Ahukini Terminal and Railway, although both were built to the same track gauge. Almost all railway trackage on Kauai was connected together due to an agreement with the U.S. Government to interconnect the common carriers and sugar plantation railways. The government imposed this as a condition before they would agree to improve the port of Nawiliwili for ocean going ships. The line was opened 1907. In 1936 the company name was changed to the Kauai Terminal Company. The last train ran 1947, with rail operations replaced by trucks. The company continues to exist as the present-day Kauai Commercial Company.

He migrated to the frontier of the province of North Carolina with many other Scots-Irish colonists, and became a leader in the Scots-Irish community. He was one of the Presbyterian leaders who obtained a charter for Queen's College (subsequently known as Queen's Museum), which was a forerunner of Queens University of Charlotte. The college was permanently closed in 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, when British troops invaded the area.
When Mecklenburg County was created in 1762, Alexander was appointed as one of the county's first justices of the peace. That same year he became an officer in the local militia. In 1768 he was among the trustees who founded the town of Charlotte, and the following year he was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly.
Before the American Revolution, the Scots-Irish of North Carolina were generally supportive of the British royal governors of the province, which often put them at odds with other colonists. In 1765, Alexander was beaten by squatters while he was attempting to survey land for royal officials. In 1771, Alexander and his militiamen responded to Governor Tryon's call for support in putting down the Regulators, but the Mecklenburg men arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Alamance.
American Revolution and after.
This support for the royal governors ended in the early stages of the American Revolution. After Governor Josiah Martin dissolved the North Carolina Assembly in 1774, Alexander was elected to the first North Carolina Provincial Congress.
In May 1775, Alexander was chosen by his militia company to be a delegate at a meeting held in Charlotte where measures were to be discussed regarding the ongoing dispute between the British Empire and the American colonies. Alexander, who was chairman of the Mecklenburg Committee of Safety, was elected to serve as the meeting's chairman. According to testimony first published many years after the event, the delegates adopted and signed the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence on May 20. If the story is true, the Mecklenburg Declaration preceded the United States Declaration of Independence by more than a year, but the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration is discounted by most modern historians. The meeting also produced (on May 31) the radical Mecklenburg Resolves, the authenticity of which is not questioned, which effectively ended British authority in Mecklenburg County.
Whether Alexander helped draft either of these documents is not known. Based on the traditions surrounding the Mecklenburg Declaration, older histories of North Carolina in the American Revolution portrayed Alexander as a major figure in the local revolutionary movement. According to Converse Clowse, modern academic historians find little documentary evidence to support this traditional view. Alexander's public service clearly indicates that he was trusted by the community, but the degree to which he made major decisions and helped shape public opinion cannot be determined from the surviving contemporary evidence.
Alexander died in Mecklenburg County. He is buried with his wife Dorcas in the graveyard at the Sugar Creek Presbyterian Church.

South Cumminsville, Cincinnati

South Cumminsville is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. It is bordered by Northside, Camp Washington, Millvale, and Fay Apartments.
History.
For years, South Cumminsville was the southern portion of a larger settlement known as Cumminsville. Cumminsville was incorporated in 1865 and annexed into Cincinnati eight years later. In the early 1900s, growth attracted many German Catholics. Cumminsville also attracted a number of African-Americans, who moved to the area of Follett and Dreman avenues. This sub-neighborhood became known as South Cumminsville, according to history books. Boosted by the opening of the Millvale apartments in the 1950s, South Cumminsville evolved into a predominantly African-American community. Many of the newcomers in the northern portions of Cumminsville became to identify themselves with Northside, while South Cumminsville retained its identity.
One of the more grisly aspects of Cumminsville history stems from a rash of unsolved murders that occurred there in the early 1900s. From 1904-1910, five women were savagely slain within a mile of the Spring Grove and Winton Road corner in Cumminsville, earning the district the grisly sobriquet of "the murder zone" and sparking fear that Cincinnati was in the grip of its first serial killer. These five cases remain unsolved, and are detailed in the first chapter of the book "Queen City Gothic", by local author and true crime historian JT. Townsend.
Community organizations and projects.
South Cumminsville is a strong, active community. South Cumminsville United For Better Housing (SCUFBH) continues to look forward to future projects to continue building homeownership in the neighborhood. The South Cumminsville Community Council (SCCC) continues to work to improve the neighborhood. It has a newsletter that goes to each member of the community four times a year and it has been focusing its efforts on community beautification. Twice a year SCCC hosts a neighborhood clean-up day and has been working on teaching the youth about recycling. In 2004, SCCC painted a mural at the neighborhood gateway at Beekman Street and put up banners on the major neighborhood streets. Both of these projects were designed through collaboration between the neighborhood youth and seniors to illustrate the history and beauty of the community. SCCC hopes to continue this theme of neighborhood beautification and community teamwork in future gateway projects.

South Fairmount is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. It contains one of the highest concentrations of Section 8 housing in Hamilton County.
Lick Run Watershed Improvements.
The Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati (MSD) is in the design stage of a stream daylighting project to restore the Lick Run which used to flow between Queen City Avenue and Westwood Avenue. MSD is required to remove 85% of the annual 14 billion gallons of the combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that occur each year in the outdated sewer system during rain events. The largest contributor to the overflows is CSO 5 in the Lick Run Watershed which dumps 1.7 billion gallons of raw sewage into the Mill Creek annually. By separating the storm water from the sanitary sewage most of the rain water can be sent straight into a creek, thus alleviating the watershed from CSOs.
Two plans have been proposed by MSD to solve the issue. The preferred plan is to daylight the stream, allowing the rain water to collect in the restored Lick Run and discharge into the Mill Creek. This option is anticipated to cost approximately $195 million. Some community opposition has been raised for this alternative with a few residents likening it to an "open drainage ditch" and concern about the existing businesses and building stock between the two thoroughfares. 
The alternative "grey" solution would consist of constructing a new 25-foot diameter tunnel to replace the 19.5-foot tunnel currently in place. This alternative would not separate the storm water from the sanitary sewage so MSD would still be responsible for treating the storm water as if it is sewage. This alternative is expected to cost about $312 million.

Hemigrapsus oregonensis

Hemigrapsus oregonensis is a small shore crab of the family Varunidae; it was formerly classified under the family Grapsidae. It is known under several common names, including "yellow shore crab", "hairy shore crab", "green shore crab", "mud-flat crab", and "Oregon shore crab".
Despite its name, the body color of this crab can vary. Often, it has a light grey, green or yellow carapace with small blue/black spots and lighter colored legs with similar spots, but it may be red/brown with green spots. The legs with claws (chelipeds) are usually cream/white with no spots.
This species typically lives in mud flats and can be found in large numbers in the San Francisco Bay, and coastal areas of Oregon and Washington states in the United States. Its diet primarily consists of diatoms and green algae, but it will occasionally eat meat.
Although closely related, the adult "H. oregonensis" is smaller () than the purple shore crab, "H. nudus". It can be distinguished from "H. nudus" by observing the legs and claws – the legs of "H. oregonensis", but not "H. nudus", are covered in many hairs called setae, while the claws of "H. nudus", but not "H. oregonensis", are covered in purple or red spots.

Massey-Harris Model 20

The Massey-Harris Model 20 was a two-plow tractor built by Massey-Harris (later Massey Ferguson) from 1946-1948. Introduced to commemorate Massey's 100th anniversary in 1947, the 20 was virtually identical to the earlier Model 81, which first appeared in 1941. About 8,000 Model 20s were sold, in row crop or standard models, with the choice of gasoline or kerosene (known as tractor vaporising oil, or TVO, in Britain) as fuel. The Model 20 was replaced in 1948 by the Model 22.
Pricing.
With a base price of around C$1450, about C$500 more than the 81, the 20 was competitive with Ford and Ferguson-Brown models of the period. 
Weight.
The bare weight without ballast was 3,000 lb (1,350 kg) (some 700 lb {300 kg} less than the contemporary Model 30, which dramatically outsold it, but about 400 lb {180 kg} more than the earlier 81). 
Engine.
The 124 in3 (2,031 cc) engine inherited from the 81, and the 101 before it, produced 31 hp (23 kW) at the belt, and was manufactured by Continental, like all Massey Harris tractors at the time.
Transmission.
The 20 offered four speeds (against the 30's 5), providing a top speed of 2.5 mph (4 km/h) in First (low) and 13.5 mph (21.6 km/h) in Fourth (high).

The Ongoing Adventures of Rocket Llama

The Ongoing Adventures of Rocket Llama is a webcomic starring "a high-flying llama, a sword-swinging cat, and a rocket as loyal as a cowboy hero's horse." Created by Alex Langley while he was a student at Henderson State University, the comic first appeared in a comic book titled "The Workday Comic".
The Workday Comic.
For The Workday Comic comics anthology, a spin-off of Scott McCloud's "24-Hour Comics", comics creators each wrote and drew their own eight-page stories in eight hours which turned into an ongoing publication. Rocket Llama debuted in one of the first issue's six stories, the first story completed.
Co-presenting with comics author and scholar Danny Fingeroth ("Dazzler", "Spider-Man", "Superman on the Couch") during a Comics Arts Conference panel at 2008's Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, the creators explained how the first Rocket Llama story evolved into a webcomic. Whether despite the original story's childlike art or because of it, the Rocket Llama story proved to be the most popular in the 2007 anthology collection of the eight-hour comics. After comic artist Stephen R. Bissette, an instructor at the Center for Cartoon Studies and comic book artist best known for his work on "Swamp Thing" with Alan Moore, read all of the stories in the first volume of "The Workday Comic", he remarked, "That llama's gonna stick with me."
Debut story.
The full title of Rocket Llama's debut story in "The Workday Comic" No. 1 (spring, 2007) was ""The Ongoing Adventures of Rocket Llama" #112: 'Trouble in Paradise'". The story introduced the taciturn hero Rocket Llama and his talkative sidekick, an anthropomorphic cat named Bartholemew 'Bart' Meowsenhausen, who find themselves stranded on an island after a battle with an enemy called Jetpack Dog. Spherical islanders capture them and then challenge them to combat. A villain named Böwser vön Überdog arrives with Jetpack Dog and, in a sudden "Star Wars" parody, summons a giant robot known as the Super Robot Dog Walker which blasts a volcano to bits. Before it can fire a second blast, Rocket Llama destroys it by getting it to swallow a pot of water and backfire. The story ends with Böwser tied up and the heroes using the giant robot dog head as a boat to get themselves home, with the promise of the next story to be titled, "Yuck! Yukon!"
E-zine.
Following Zuda Comics' style guidelines, Nick Langley redrew the story with a less childlike drawing style in webcomic form for online publication as the flagship title for the website rocketllama.com. The Rocket Llama World Headquarters e-zine has an affiliation of websites featuring webcomics, art, entertainment reviews, and scholarly studies of comics.
With support from university resources, the creators assembled a "herd your nerds" support system of contributors working together. In addition to "The Ongoing Adventures of Rocket Llama", e-zine features from the Rocket Llama Ground Crew include Action Flick Chick movie reviews by G4TV's Next Woman of the Web, cosplayer Katrina Hill; The Action Chick webcomic; Marko's Corner comics, cartoon arts, and podcasts by Marko Head; Reddie Steady comics for college newspapers; "The Workday Comic", the 8-hour comics which spawned Rocket Llama; "You Can't Do That on the Internet" film crossover comics; interviews (e.g., Blair Butler, Dan DiDio, Steve Niles, Seth Green); convention reports; gaming news; blogs; and other articles.
Online comic.
The online story featured a new cover and omitted a one-page gag, a preview for an unrelated "Stealth Potato" comic, which had appeared as an intermission in the middle of the original story. The original story also appeared online as the comic's "ashcan copy."
The authors present the Rocket Llama stories metafictionally as the world's oldest comic book, established in 1916, which they allegedly rediscovered and are adapting into webcomics. "Deep underground, in an archaic vault we searched until we found the fabled tales. As both the current production team behind "The Ongoing Adventures of Rocket Llama" and appreciators of such groundbreaking literature, we have taken it upon ourselves to restore these classic issues to a glory more befitting a modern, digital age."
Although every "issue" is presented with panels and screens in the correct order for each story, the issues are presented out of order as if readers were discovering old issues of a classic comic book in a seemingly haphazard order, however they come to find them. After the redrawn number #112's online publication came the serialized time travel story #136–137, "Time Flies When You're on the Run," appearing one page at a time throughout each week and expanding the cast with characters like the scientist Professor Percival Penguin and cavedogs who joined them by stowing away in the heroes' time rocket during the supposed previous issue. Issue No. 152 followed with "The Tomb of Nosfur-Rattu".
Special "Rocket Llama Says" bonus features appear only in "ashcan" form drawn by the original creator. The only "modern" comic has been a one-page Halloween cartoon, supposedly an excerpt from issue #1110.
Kidjutsu, an all-ages webcomics site which publishes series such as "Inverloch (webcomic)" and "Dandy & Company", publishes completed Rocket Llama issues. Palace in the Sky Publishing also carries the series.
Spin-off comic: The Action Chick.
After website contributor Action Flick Chick Katrina Hill became G4TV's official Next Woman of the Web, she and the Rocket Llama creators spun off her Action Chick avatar which originated with Rocket Llama off into the character's own webcomic "The Action Chick". In the comic, Hill becomes her avatar in the style of James Cameron's "Avatar", with Sigourney Weaver, Richard Crenna, and various Predators appearing as supporting cast in movie parodies and mockups of popular culture.

Heinrich Biltz

Heinrich Biltz (born May 26, 1865 in Berlin, died October 29, 1943 in Breslau) was a German chemist and professor.
Life and career.
Heinrich Biltz was the son of Karl Friedrich Biltz who was a literary scholar and theatre critic His brother Wilhelm Biltz was also a noted chemist.
After his university entrance diploma at the Royal Grammar School (Königliches Wilhelm-Gymnasium) in Berlin in 1885 he firstly began studying chemistry in the Humboldt University of Berlin with August Wilhelm von Hofmann and later in the University of Göttingen with Victor Meyer. In the year 1888 he awarded his doctor in natural science with the continuation of the researches commenced by Victor Meyer on the molecular weight of substances at high temperatures. During this time he determined also the vapour density from Tin (II) chloride and Sulphur.
Since July 8, 1891 he firstly was professor of chemistry in the University of Greifswald and from 1897 succeeded as the Chair of the Department of Inorganic Chemistry in the University of Kiel and continued his research activities on the field of the determination of vapour density. In 1908 he also succeeded in the synthesis of Phenytoin, which was used 30 years later as an effective drug for the control of seizure disorders. From autumn 1911 until his retirement in 1933 he lectured in the newly arranged Albert Ladenburg Institute of the University of Breslau (Wroclaw) with the main emphasis on chemical reactions of organic substances, especially the reactions of Acetylene and Autoxidation. He concentrated his further research activities on the chemistry of Uric Acid. He achieved and proved the complete oxidative degradation of Uric Acid with several oxidising agents.
His work was interrupted when he participated in World War I as reserve officer. After the war he took up his research activities considerably and from time to time in close co-operation with his younger brother Wilhelm Biltz, who was also professor of chemistry, and with further renowned chemists.
The German Chemical Industry established in 1925 the Heinrich-Biltz- Foundation which was destined to support highly skilled students. In honour of the merits of Heinrich Biltz, Walter Hückel issued an obituary in the journal "Chemische Berichte" and annexed a complete bibliography of his work.
He married Freya de la Motte Fouqué, a daughter of a physician in Kiel. This marriage remained childless.

Shattered Horizon

Shattered Horizon is a first-person shooter video game developed and published by Futuremark Games Studio. The game was released on the Steam digital distribution service on 4 November 2009. 
Gameplay.
"Shattered Horizon" is a first-person shooter where players fight in zero gravity surrounded by the broken remains of Earth's orbital infrastructure and billions of tons of rocky debris thrown into orbit by a huge explosion on the Moon.
In "Shattered Horizon", players have complete freedom of movement. They can make full use of the space setting and zero gravity to set up tactics and strategies that would be impossible in games constrained by gravity.
The game's designer states that without gravity players will experience gameplay that is both familiar to fans of the FPS style and yet different from any game they have played before.
Plot.
"Shattered Horizon" is set in 2049. Man is back on the Moon and the companies that took him there are reaping huge profits. Their greed soon leads to the largest mining accident in history. A catastrophic explosion throws billions of tons of rocky debris into near-Earth space, its aftershocks threatening to tear apart the Moon itself.
Fragments of the Moon settle around the Earth and become known as the Arc, named after the dramatic shape they draw across the night sky. With Earth surrounded by debris, there is little chance of rescue or return for the thousands of people stranded in space.
The International Space Agency's (ISA) astronauts and scientists trapped in the battered International Space Station are given the task of apprehending those responsible for the catastrophe. Weapons are among the last supplies sent to the station before the supply route from Earth is cut. The Moon Mining Cooperative (MMC) finds itself facing serious charges after only barely surviving the cataclysm. Cut off from Earth, they see the ISA as a threat to their very existence.
The two sides are drawn into an armed conflict. Desperate battles are fought over strategic locations and the scant supplies from Earth that make it through the shroud of debris. Control of the Arc now means the difference between survival and death in the cold of space.
Development.
"Shattered Horizon" is Futuremark Games Studio's first title. The studio was founded in January 2008 by a company known for its PC benchmarking tools 3DMark and PCMark. The development is self-funded.
The developers of "Shattered Horizon" have stated in interviews that their goal was to "make something that hasn't really been done" and that entering into game development was discussed within the company for long before it was publicly announced.
The game was first shown to press at Games Convention 2008 in Leipzig. GameSpot's first look preview notes that the game has "a really great premise" and that the gameplay "promises to benefit" from said premise. A more advanced build was shown to press at Gamescom 2009, where GameSpot found that "Shattered Horizon is an intriguing online shooter that seems poised to grab attention" and that "the controls in Shattered Horizon are remarkably easy to grasp".
Eurogamer's hands-on preview from the game's closed beta test reported that "Shattered Horizon is intuitively playable and immediately comprehensible". The preview notes an attention to detail and the developer's intent to make the setting true to real space, and concludes that "assuming Futuremark can sustain its developmental momentum, this will be one shooter that should be able to reach a stable orbit around the homeworld of gaming interest."
"Play Magazine" published a detailed preview of the game that praised the game's graphics and ambitious game design: "the lofty goal of representing FPS combat in realistic zero gravity environments has been achieved". The preview made special mention of the game's setting and back story, concluding with a challenge to the developer, "Let’s build a franchise".
In March 2011, the Last Stand pack was made available as downloadable content. This expansion adds in single player and online co-op, as well as a new game mode.
Maps.
There are currently eight maps provided with "Shattered Horizon", four from after the game's release with the Moonrise content pack. These maps are diverse, ranging from the damaged ISS (ISS), to a mining station on an asteroid (Moondust), to a two-faced asteroid harboring an abandoned research station (Flipside), to a sector of the Arc (The Arc). Each map is playable in either the assault, battle, or skirmish mode.
Reception.
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from selected critics, "Shattered Horizon" has received a score of 72/100 which indicates "mixed or average reviews". 
GameSpot rated Shattered Horizon 7.5/10, praising the handling of zero-gravity movement, atmospheric environments and the unique and deep combat mechanics, but citing the system requirements (particularly the requirement of DirectX 10) and the lack of single player game modes, levels and tutorial or bot support as its major setbacks.
Post-launch, developer Futuremark Games Studio addressed some of the common criticisms by releasing several free updates to the game. The Moonrise map pack released February 16, 2010 added four new levels, the Firepower weapons pack released May 5, 2010 introduced new weapons and grenades and the Last Stand pack released March 17, 2011 introduced single player options with bots and a new game mode.

Nabeshima Naoyoshi

Viscount was the 13th and final "daimyō" of Kashima Domain in Hizen Province, Kyūshū, Japan (modern-day Saga Prefecture). Before the Meiji Restoration, his courtesy title was "Bizen no Kami." He became a politician in the Meiji era, and served as the first governor of Okinawa Prefecture.
Biography.
Born in the Kashima Domain in Hizen province, Naoyoshi was the 3rd son of the 10th "daimyō" of Kashima, Nabeshima Naonaga. In 1848, the 13th "daimyō" of Kashima, Nabeshima Naosaga, went into forced retirement under strong pressure from Nabeshima Naomasa due to fiscal mismanagement, and the title went to Naoyoshi. During the early part of his administration, Kashima's financial affairs were so dire that they came to be entirely handled by the main Saga Domain, and in 1851 Naoyoshi even proposed that the domain be abolished and absorbed into Saga. He was opposed by the other branches of the Nabeshima clan (i.e. Hasunoike Domain and Ogi Domain.
In 1853, Kashima Domain had a further financial burden imposed when the Tokugawa Shogunate assigned it responsibility for security during the visit of Russian diplomat Yevfimy Putyatin to Nagasaki as part of Russia’s efforts to end Japan’s national isolation policy and to establish commercial and diplomatic relations.
From 1860, Naoyoshi began secret discussions with representatives of the Imperial court and became a supporter of the movement to overthrow the Tokugawa regime. In 1866 he protected Soejima Taneomi, who was being hunted by the Shogunate. In 1868, with the start of the Boshin War, he pledged Kashima domain in support of the Satchō Alliance and Emperor Meiji.
In June 1869, the title of "daimyō" was abolished, and Naoyoshi was appointed domain governor. However, in 1871, Kashima Domain itself was abolished with the abolition of the han system, and became part of the new Saga Prefecture. Naoyoshi subsequently relocated to Tokyo.
From August 1872 to 1876, Naoyoshi traveled to the United States. On his return, he served as an advisor to Emperor Meiji, and traveled in the retinue of the Emperor to Kyoto in 1877, during the Satsuma Rebellion. From 1878, he was appointed an official tutor to the Emperor under the Imperial Household Ministry.
Following the 1879 abolition of the Ryūkyū Kingdom and its annexation by Japan as Okinawa Prefecture, Naoyoshi was appointed the prefecture's first governor, arriving there aboard the "Tokai-maru" on May 18, 1879
Under his administration, the national public education system began to be implemented in Okinawa, with a particular focus on teaching the standard Japanese language, which very few in the islands could speak at that time. Many schools were established during the period of Naoyoshi's administration, and the prefecture's economic production was increased, particularly in the area of sugar production.
In 1881, Naoyoshi was recalled to Tokyo, and became president of the "Genrōin". With the establishment of the "kazoku" peerage, he became a , and a member of the House of Peers on the establishment of the Diet of Japan in 1890.
In his later years he helped build hospitals and schools in the region of Kashima, which he had once ruled, and was awarded Second Court rank shortly before his death in 1915.

Sultan Mahmud ibn Nizam al-Din Yahya

Sultan Mahmud (c. 1464 – c. 1543) was the last Mihrabanid malik of Sistan, from c. 1495 until c. 1537.
Biography.
Sultan Mahmud was the son of Nizam al-Din Yahya and the sister of the Timurid Sultan Abu Sa'id.
Nizam al-Din Yahya had died in 1480, having lost most of Sistan to the Timurids; his territories were restricted to the mountainous region bordering Baluchistan. The inheritance fell to Sultan Mahmud's half-brother Shams al-Din Muhammad, but the latter quickly proved himself incapable of ruling; as a result Sultan Mahmud ended up assuming effective control of the government. He planned to recapture Sistan and marched on the capital Shahr-i Sistan, but was defeated by the Timurid army and nearly drowned while crossing the Helmand River.
A change in the Timurid leadership of Sistan, combined with local appeals for the Mihrabanids to return, prompted Sultan Mahmud and Shams al-Din Muhammad to try again to reconquer the province. This time they were successful, and the brothers moved into Shahr-i Sistan. The joint administration did not last for long, however, as the local lords and military commanders grew increasingly dissatisfied with Shams al-Din Muhammad. Eventually the latter was deposed and Sultan Mahmud was formally made malik.
Relations with the Uzbeks and Safavids.
In 1507 the Shaybanid Uzbek Muhammad Shaybani put an end to Timurid rule in Khursasan and occupied Herat. Muhammad Shaybani then sent an army under the command of his nephew Shah Mansur Bakhshi to take over Sistan. Sultan Mahmud, following the advice of his advisers, abandoned the capital and made his way to the borderlands near Makran, where it would be difficult for the Uzbeks to engage them. He spent the next two years there waiting for an opportunity to strike against the Uzbeks.
By the autumn of 1510 Sultan Mahmud judged it wise to mount an offensive; crossing the Helmand, his army was able to surprise and defeat the Uzbeks and their local allies. Shah Mansur Bakhshi was killed and the Mihrabanids were able to reoccupy Shahr-i Sistan. At approximately the same time, the Safavids had invaded Khursasan and defeated Muhammad Shaybani and his army. Sultan Mahmud decided to make his submission to the Safavid shah Isma'il and set out for Herat, where the shah was residing. He became a vassal of Isma'il, after which he was eventually allowed to return to Sistan.
As a Safavid vassal, Sultan Mahmud was required to initiate the use of the Shi'a rites in Sistan, a move that was deeply unpopular in the traditionally Sunni province. He also had to accept the presence of a Qizilbash army in Sistan, and of a "wakil", or representative of the shah, named Mir Pir Quli. The "wakil" remained in Sistan for ten years. During this time Sultan Mahmud moved out of Shahr-i Sistan and set himself up in the fortress of Taraqun. A program to repair several other fortresses in the province was also begun.
Last Years.
Local discontent with the Qizilbash and Mir Pir Quli prompted Sultan Mahmud to bribe them to abandon Sistan for the border regions; as a result Safavid influence over Sistan was temporarily lessened. By this time, however, the malik had become tired of ruling. He attempted to transfer power to his son-in-law Malik Yahya but this move failed, and the deaths of several Mihrabanid family members left him without anyone to succeed him. Eventually he gave over effective control of the government to a man of unknown connection with the Mihrabanid family, Amir Muhammad-i Mahmud, and gave himself up to a life of pleasure in Taraqun. These events contributed to a weakening of the central government: robbers became a problem and at least one local official revolted against Mihrabanid rule.
By c. 1537 the Safavid shah Tahmasp decided to gain fuller control over Sistan. He sent a "wakil" to the province and gave him direct control over four districts. Sultan Mahmud disliked these changes and abandoned Sistan for India, where he was received by the Mughal Emperor Humayun and given the governorship of Lahore for five years. At the end of this time he returned to Iran and spent a year at the court of the Safavid Shah in Qazvin, where he died in around 1543. Although there were members of the Mihrabanid family that survived him, Sistan was henceforth controlled by Safavid "wakils".

Wilhelm Biltz

Wilhelm Biltz (born March 8, 1877 in Berlin, died November 13, 1943 in Heidelberg) was a German chemist and scientific editor.
In addition to his scholarly work, Biltz is noted for commanding the principal German tank involved in the first ever tank-on-tank battle in history at the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux.
Life and career.
Wilhelm Biltz was the son of Karl Friedrich Biltz who was a literary scholar and theatre critic. His brother Heinrich Biltz also became a noted chemist.
After his university entrance diploma at the Royal Grammar School (Königliches Wilhelm-Gymnasium) in Berlin in 1895 and influenced by his elder brother Heinrich, he began studying chemistry in the Humboldt University of Berlin, the University of Heidelberg and continued his studies in 1898 with professor Friedrich Wilhelm Semmler in the University of Greifswald where he was awarded his doctorate in natural science with research on the chemistry of Terpenes.
Academic career.
From 1900 he worked as an assistant and from 1903 as an associate professor with Otto Wallach at the University of Göttingen. There he concentrated his work firstly on the determination of vapour density in solutions of inorganic compounds and later he was engaged in researches into the chemistry of colloids. He gained further scientific and practical experiences in the university research institute of Clemens Winkler in analytical and inorganic chemistry and later in Metallurgy in Göttingen with Gustav Tamman. During these years he also investigated the influence of temperature on the properties of non-metallic systems as for example Polysulfides of Rubidium and Caesium by the use of thermal analysis.
At the age of 28, on March 15, 1905 he succeeded on being promoted to professor at the Clausthal University of Technology where he lectured until 1921.
World War I.
His work was interrupted when he participated in World War I. He held the rank of Second lieutenant throughout the war and was honoured with the Iron Cross first class.
His military service is notable for his command of the German A7V tank that took part in first ever tank-versus-tank battle, during the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux in April 1918. During the battle his tank encountered a group of three British Mark IV tanks – two "females tanks", armed only with machine guns and a single "male tank", armed with 6-pound guns.
Both the British female tanks were damaged and retreated, as their machine guns had no effect on Blitz's A7V.
In a running battle that followed, both tanks manoeuvred to avoid the other's fire while lining up on their opponent. Biltz's tank lost the duel – it was hit three times by the British tank and heeled over on its side. The crew abandoned their A7V but five were killed by continued fire from the Mark IV, which went on to engage two more A7V tanks that had appeared on the scene.
Biltz's men were able to recover their damaged tank later.
Post war.
After the war, Biltz continued his academic career. He was appointed as professor and director of the inorganic-chemical institute of the Technical University of Hanover on March 22, 1921. Here he had his the most successful years and he supported young talents as for example Wilhelm Klemm or Werner Fischer.
During his activities as a long-time member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina of Halle and as constant member of the board of the German Bunsen Society he applied his energies for the further development of sciences and research.
In addition to the above memberships he acquired renown as an author of textbooks and some of them he wrote together with his brother Heinrich Biltz. Furthermore he was an academic author of the ‘journal for inorganic and general chemistry’ for many years until his early retirement due to impairment to health.
He never married and remained childless.

Second General Army (Japan)

The was an army group of the Imperial Japanese Army responsible for the defense of western Honshū, Kyūshū and Shikoku during the final stage of Pacific War.
History.
The Second General Army was established on April 8, 1945 with the dissolution of the General Defense Command into the First and Second General Army. It was essentially a home guard and garrison, responsible for civil defense, anti-aircraft defenses, and for organizing guerilla warfare cells in anticipation of the projected Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands in Operation Downfall (or in Japanese terminology). Although its territory encompassed all of western Japan, its primary mission was to ensure the security of southern Kyūshū, which was regarded as the most probable target for invasion. Its forces consisted mostly of poorly trained reservists, conscripted students and home guard militia. 
After the fall of Okinawa, the command of the Second General Army was relocated to Hiroshima. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, most of the military units, logistical arms and command staff of the Second General Army was killed. Survivors regrouped at Ujina Air Base at the outskirts of Hiroshima, where they organized relief efforts and maintained public order in Hiroshima once martial law was proclaimed. However, the atomic bombing ended the Second General Army as an effective military organization for Imperial Japanese Army units in western Japan. Elements remained in place under the American occupation authorities until November 1945 to assist with the demobilization of Japanese troops.

Wali (game)

Wali is a two-player abstract strategy game from Africa. It is unknown specifically which African country the game originates from. Players attempt to form a 3 in-a-row of their pieces, and in doing so capture a piece from their opponent. The game has two phases: Drop Phase and Move Phase. Players first drop as many of their pieces as possible in the Drop Phase, then move them to form 3 in-a-rows which allows them to capture the other player's pieces in the Move Phase. 
The game is closely related to Dara. The main differences is that in Wali that a player cannot drop a piece on the board orthogonally adjacent to one of his or her own piece already on the board. 
Goal.
The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces is the winner. Captures are accomplished by forming 3 in-a-rows of their own pieces. 
Equipment.
A 5 x 6 square grid is used which makes for 30 intersection points. Each player has 12 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other the white pieces. The pieces are played on the intersection points.
Game Play and Rules.
1. The board is empty in the beginning. The pieces are set beside the board. 
2. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. Players alternate their turns. 
3. Drop Phase: Players drop a piece onto a vacant point on the board that is not orthogonally adjacent to a piece of their own already on the board. A player may only drop one piece per turn. Players must continue to drop pieces until they can no longer do so according to the rule. If a player can no longer drop a piece, that player must pass their turn until the other player can no longer drop a piece also. 
4. Move Phase: Both players are only allowed to move their pieces after both players can no longer continue to drop their pieces in the Drop Phase. This may mean that they still have a reserve of their pieces next to the board. "It is uncertain, however, whether the remaining pieces in each player's reserve is ever dropped on the board later."
A piece moves one space orthogonally onto a vacant point on the board. If a player forms a 3 in-a-row with their own pieces, then he or she can remove any one of his opponent's piece from the board. The 3 in-a-row must strictly consist three pieces (no more and no less) in order to allow the player to capture an enemy piece. 
"It seems that 4 or more in-a-rows are allowed in this game even though they do not allow a player to capture an enemy piece. In Dara they are strictly prohibited throughout the game. It is uncertain whether a 3 in-a-row counts in the Drop Phase of the game. In Dara, 3 in-a-rows formed in the Drop Phase do not count, and therefore do not allow a player to capture an enemy piece on the board. It is also uncertain whether a player can capture an enemy piece that is part of a 3 in-a-row itself. In Dara, this is also prohibited. It is also uncertain how many enemy pieces a player can capture if in one move a player forms two or more 3 in-a-rows. In Dara, only one enemy piece is allowed to be captured per turn. Lastly, it is also uncertain whether diagonal 3 in-a-rows count. In Dara they do not count, only orthogonal 3 in-a-rows count."

Siege of Concepcion

During the Siege of Concepcion of the Arauco War, 20,000 warriors of the army of the Mapuche laid siege to the Spanish garrison and civil population in the fortress of Concepcion, Chile.
History.
In early 1564, Spanish governor Pedro de Villagra, was taking measures to protect all the towns and forts he already held against the growing Mapuche revolt and to organize a field army in Concepcion. He knew that one of the Mapuche objectives was to surround Concepcion, and preparations were made to support a long siege. 
Raids by Mapuche bands had made it unsafe for Spaniards to go farther than a league from the city. After a brief fight 3,000 Mapuche in the Itata River valley under Loble defeated the troops of captain Francisco de Vaca coming with reinforcements from Santiago. Meanwhile another 3,000 warriors under Millalelmo defeated the troops coming from Angol under captain, Juan Perez de Zurita, at a crossing of the Andalién River two leagues from Concepcion. Both defeats had reduced the garrison of Concepcion to defensive measures and cut off Concepcion from aid by land. The survivors of the two battles had to retreat to Santiago and were in no condition to break through the investment around Concepcion. 
Meanwhile the caciques Millalelmu and Loble with 20,000 warriors from the area between the Itata and Bio-Bio rivers, had looted and destroyed Spanish estancias in the vicinity of Concepcion, took their herds and then settled down to besiege Concepcion in early February 1564. The Mapuche entered the city, sacking and burning it, the population crowding within the walls of its fortress with its 200 man garrison under governor Pedro de Villagra. The Mapuche then built a fortified camp on heights overlooking the city from which they descended to attack it. 
The siege lasted two months with continuous skirmishes. At the end of March two Spanish ships arrived bringing food that permitted the population to continue the siege for a much longer time. On the other side the Mapuche had used up local sources of food and without pack animals and transport vehicles were finding it difficult to bring in enough to maintain their large force. Also the harvest season was coming and failure to bring in the crops would result in a winter of hunger for their families. With the recent news of the defeat of the Mapuche toqui Illangulién at the Battle of Angol, they were also nervous that their undefended homes might be attacked from Angol or Santiago. On the first of April the Mapuche army raised the siege and dispersed to their homes for the winter.

<doc id="18781548" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18781548" title="Turkish name">
Turkish name

A Turkish name consists of an "ad" (given name; plural "adlar") and a "soyadı" (surname). Turkish names exist in a "full name" format. While there is only one "soyadı" (surname) in the full name, there may be more than one "ad" (given name). The "soyadı" is written as the last element of the full name, after all given names (except that official documents often use the format "Soyadı, Ad Ad").
Given names.
At least one name, often two, rarely more, are given to a person just after he or she is born. Most names are gender-specific (Oğuz strictly for males, Tuğçe only for females) but many modern given names (Deniz, "Sea"; Ülkü, "Ideal" – the noun) are meaningful and are given to newborns of either sex. 
Among the common examples of the many unisex names in Turkey include, Aytaç, Deniz, Derya, Evren, Evrim, Özgür, and Yücel. And unlike English unisex names, most Turkish unisex names have been traditionally used for both genders. However some unisex names are used more for one gender (for example, Derya is used more for girls whereas Özgür is used more for boys). Names are given to babies by their parents and then registered in "The Central Civil Registration System" (MERNIS) while preparing the baby's identity document at the birth registration office of the district's governorship.
Turkish names are often words which have specific meanings in the Turkish language. These names are almost always pure Turkish names that derive from Turkish words. These names may either be modern names or be derived from Turkic mythology. 
Most Turkish names can easily be differentiated from others, except those of other Turkic nations particularly Azerbaijan, especially if they are of pure Turkic origin. The "Law on the Adoption and Implementation of the Turkish Alphabet" of 1928, in force as decreed by article 174 of the Constitution of Turkey, prescribes that only Turkish letters may be used on birth certificates. As the Turkish alphabet has no Q, W or X, many common Kurdish names cannot be officially given unless they are transliterated.
Giving a second name in (romanized) Arabic to signify their religion is distinguishable in Turkey. Ideological concerns of the families also affect naming behaviour. Those Arabic names are the names of important figures in the religion of Islam such as Muhammed, and Ali. Many of these names are Turkified i.e. "Mehmet" (derived from Muhammed).
Surnames.
Until the introduction of the Law on Family Names in 1934, as part of Atatürk's Reforms, most Muslim Turks had no surname. The law required all citizens of Turkey to adopt an official surname. Before that, male Turks used their father's name followed by "-oğlu" ("son of"), or a nickname of the family, before their given name (e.g. Mustafa-oğlu Mehmet, Köselerin Hasan) before the modern era. The Turks who descended from a ruling house used "-zade" ("descendant in the male line") (e.g. Sami Paşazade Mehmet Bey).
The surname ("soyadı", literally "lineage name" or "family name") is an ancestry-based name following a person's given names, used for addressing people or the family. The surname ("soyadı") is a single word according to Turkish law. It is not gender-specific and has no gender-dependent modifications. The "soyadı" is neither patronymic nor matronymic. Surnames in Turkey are patrilineal: they pass in the male line from father to his legal children without any change in form. Turkey has abolished all notions of nobility; thus, there is no noble form or type of surname.
In contemporary Turkish Civil Law, when a man and woman marry, the wife takes her (new) husband's surname, but if she wants, she may continue to use her maiden name in front of her new surname, which is the official family name. When they divorce, the woman returns to her pre-marriage surname. The court may grant a woman the right to keep their ex-husband's surname (or her double surname) after divorcing; the court's decision must consider both the man's and the woman's situations. A woman may have only two surnames due to marriage. Thus, a woman who continues to use double surname after divorcing, cannot take a third surname by marrying again. The child of a family takes the "family name", which is his or her father's surname. A child takes their mother's surname if the mother is not married, or if the father is unknown.
Turkish citizens may change their surnames according to Turkish Civil Law and Turkish Law on Population Services via court decision of "civil court of first instance".

Church End Mill, Great Dunmow

Church End Mill is a grade II listed Tower mill at Great Dunmow, Essex, England which has been converted to residential use.
History.
"Church End Mill" was built by William Redington, a miller from Harlow in 1822 for John Fuller. It incorporated second-hand machinery from a smock mill from an unknown location and the total cost of the mill was £564 10s 6d. In 1840, a new cast iron windshaft and Patent sails were fitted, but the windshaft snapped shortly afterwards and the sails landed on the outbuildings connected with the mill. The mill remained in the ownership of John Fuller until his death in 1887.
The mill did little trade after 1894, and ceased work c1902, the sails being removed then. By 1907 it was being used as a studio and during World War II was used as an observation post, the cap having been removed by then. A new cap was fitted in 1974 by millwright Philip Barrett-Lennard. The mill has been house converted, with no machinery remaining inside.
Description.
"Church End Mill" is a four storey tower mill with a conical cap with a ball finial. The mill had four single Patent sails carried on a cast iron windshaft and was winded by a six bladed fantail. The tower is high to curb level, diameter at base level and diameter at the curb. The brickwork is thick at base level. There was a stage at first floor level. Two pairs of French Burr millstones were driven by wind, with a third pair by steam engine towards the end of the mill’s working life.
As originally built, the mill had an oak windshaft, square at the poll end and long carrying four Common sails with cloths long by wide. The windshaft carried an elm brake wheel diameter with 80 cogs, which drove an elm wallower diameter with 46 cogs, carried on an oak upright shaft long and square. The clasp arm elm great spur wheel was diameter, with 105 cogs. It drove two elm stone nuts of diameter, each having 28 cogs.

Merse (river)

The Merse is an Italian river, a right tributary of the Ombrone. It runs through Tuscany for a distance of about 70 km and is the river of the Val di Merse.
Its sources are near Poggio Croce di Prata and Poggio di Montieri in the range of hills known as the Colline Metallifere. From here it takes a north-easterly direction for the first half of its course before turning sharply to the south-east. At Pontiella it receives from the right the waters of the Farma, a torrent born at Torniella, again in the Colline Metallifere). After a few kilometres the Merse enters the Ombrone at Pian di Rocca which lies half-way between the spa of Bagni di Petriolo to the west and Castiglione del Bosco to the east.
The river has recently suffered from sulphurous pollutants deriving from the old and neglected mine-workings in the upper part of its course. Fish are far less plentiful than in the past, which may be put down to the exploitation of its waters for irrigation during the summer months; nevertheless there are many cyprinids, and pike are also found.
The white mill which gives its name to the Mulino Bianco biscuit manufacturers is located on the upper course of the river: it was constructed in the early 13th century by monks from the nearby abbey of Serena.

Unalaska Island

Unalaska () is an island in the Fox Islands group of the Aleutian Islands in the US state of Alaska located at . The island has a land area of . It measures long and wide. The city of Unalaska, Alaska, covers part of the island and all of neighboring Amaknak Island where the Port of Dutch Harbor is located. The population of the island excluding Amaknak as of the 2000 census was 1,759 residents.
Unalaska is the second-largest island in the Fox Islands group and the Aleutian Islands. The coastline of Unalaska is markedly different in appearance than other major Aleutian Islands, with innumerable inlets and peninsulas. The irregular coastline is broken by three long deep bays, Beaver Inlet, Unalaska Bay, and Makushin Bay, as well as by numerous smaller bays and coves. Unalaska's terrain is rugged and covered with mountains, and during the greater part of the year the higher elevations are covered with snow.
"Unalaska" is the Aleut name for the island. Several theories about its origin exist; the most likely is that the name comes from a corruption of the Russian word "Ounalashka" from the Aleut word for near the mainland, "nawan Alaskax".
History.
The island was discovered by Vitus Bering in 1741. A Russian settlement sprang up in 1759, but four years later it was destroyed by the Aleuts, together with four merchant ships. The massacre claimed the lives of 162 Russian settlers. The survivors managed to hold their own until 1764, when they were rescued by the Russians. This event triggered bloody reprisals against the natives which cost the lives of about 5,000 Aleuts.
The 1788 expedition of Esteban José Martínez and Gonzalo López de Haro explored the coast of Alaska as far as Unalaska Island, marking the farthest west the Spanish ever explored in the region.
Also in 1788, English explorer James Cook visited the island, and spells it Oonalashka in his journal.
In Moscow on May 31, 1988, President Ronald Reagan mentioned the meeting of Americans and Russians on this island in the 19th century as an example of early US-Russian friendship.
On December 8, 2004, the Malaysian cargo ship "Selendang Ayu" ran aground off Unalaska Island, causing a large oil spill.

Leonora (opera)

Leonora, ossia L’amore coniugale ("Leonora or Conjugal Love") is an opera (specifically a "dramma semiserio") in two acts by the Italian composer Ferdinando Paer. The libretto, by Giovanni Schmidt, is based on "Léonore ou L’Amour conjugal" (1794) by Jean-Nicolas Bouilly, which was also the source of Beethoven's "Fidelio". Beethoven himself owned a score of Paer's opera and it is believed to have had some influence on his work. "Leonora" was first performed at the Kleines Kurfürstliches Theater, Dresden on 3 October 1804 with the composer's wife singing the title role. 
Synopsis.
Leonora disguises herself as a man in order to infiltrate the prison where her husband, Florestano, is being held by his enemy, Don Pizarro. She fools the jailer Rocco into giving her a job. When Don Pizarro hears of the imminent arrival of the governor, Don Fernando, he orders Rocco to execute Florestano. Leonora accompanies Rocco to the underground cell where Florestano is being held then threatens the jailer with a pistol until Don Fernando arrives and Florestano is freed.
Performances.
There was a performance given at Schwetzingen in 1976 under Peter Maag. This was recorded live and issued on the MRF label. Soloists were: Carson/Casula/Jerusalem/Frusoni/Stavrù/Luccardi/Tadeo-G (key: leonora/marcellina/fernando/florestano/pizarro/giacchino/rocco). Two years later (1978) Decca made a studio recording, also under Maag: Koszut/Gruberová/van Kesteren/Jerusalem/Orth/Brendel/Tadeo-G with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. This was in stereo and issued in the U.S. as London OSA 13133. The UK première was given by Bampton Classical Opera in 2008, in English.

In project planning, a "slippage" is the act of missing a deadline. It can be an arbitrary milestone put in place to help track progress.
To avoid slippage, one must plan his or her projects (especially research) carefully to avoid delays in schedule. Using Gantt charts and timeline diagrams can help.

Schnoor

Schnoor is the name of a street in the oldest part of the city of Bremen and also a name for the oldest quarter itself. The district owes its name to the old ship trade. The passages between the houses were often associated with occupations or objects: There was an area in which ropes and cables were produced (string = "Schnoor") and a neighboring area, where wire cables and anchor chains were manufactured (wire = "Wieren").
History.
Here are the roots of the Hanseatic city of Bremen. The Schnoor quarter had been the economic centre since early history. Fishermen, craftsmen and traders were the earliest Bremen folk and settled in the 10th century in the vicinity of the river. They built thatched cottages on the little island between the rivers Weser and Balge. It is said that the Weser formerly was a side branch of the Balge.
The first ferry service was established here, and the first bridge crossing the Weser was built around the year 1240. You can find an old wall and parts of a round tower which was erected around 1200, near the so-called "Marterburg".
In the 13th century Franciscan monks had settled and their St. John's church was constructed in the following decades.
Development.
Today the oldest houses date back to the 15th century. Most of them are from the 17th and 18th centuries. While other parts of Bremen developed with plots of about one square kilometre and merchant's villas, the plots in the Schnoor have areas which are just enough for a single houses on 55 square metres. The narrow streets were not suitable for the increase in traffic from the 19th century. The quarter became one of the poorest parts of Bremen, a situation that meant renovations were unaffordable. During the Second World War the Schnoor suffered only slight damage, so that owners of the houses had to pay a "Lastenausgleich" after 1945. But by the mid-1950s the houses were in a pitiable state.
The Senate of the Free Hanseatic Town of Bremen decided in 1959 to rebuild the historic area of the Schnoor. House owners were invited to restore rundown buildings with financial support from the State of Bremen. This development was in contrast to the common practice in many towns and cities in Germany and Europe until the late 1970s.
The situation changed with the "Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites" (1964) so that in 1973 the Schnoor became a historic district under official heritage conservation through the State Monument Authority.
One of the most famous houses which has been preserved in its original state is the "Schifferhaus" in the street of "Stavendamm". Another historic building is the Landherrnamt (1856) which initially housed the authorities administering the State of Bremen. 
The Birgittenkloster (Convent of Saint Birgitta), a small Bridgettine convent founded in October 2002 is located in the Schnoor, as is St. John's Church, a listed building with a history going back to the 14th century.

Gerardo Abad Conde

Gerardo Abad Conde (August 8, 1881 – September 10, 1936) was a Spanish politician and lawyer. Born in Ordes in A Coruña Province he was Minister of the Navy during the Second Republic.
Biography.
He received a master's degree in law and practised it in A Coruña and was the chair for Mercantile Legislation and Maritime legislation in the School of Commerce in the city. In addition, he was director of the Nautical School. Politically, he initially belonged to the Partido Republicano Autónomo of A Coruña, becoming secretary in 1908. However, in the 1920s the party integrated into the Radical Republican Party led by Alejandro Lerroux.
Abad was councilman of his city in several legislatures, occupying the mayorship between the years 1918 - 1919. In 1930, he was involved in the Lestrove Pact where on March 26, 1930, the A Coruña municipality of Lestrove, and political representatives aimed to create a Galician Republican Federation. In the elections to the constituent assembly in La Coruna in 1931, he was not selected; nevertheless, in the elections in Lugo, months later, he became deputy of that province.
In July 1933, he was elected to the Tribunal de Garantías Constitucionales (Court of Constitutional Guarantees). In early 1935, he became Minister of the Navy, and in July 1935, he was elected president of the Patronage for the Seizure of Jesuit Goods. Under his regime in the Ministry of the Navy, from January 23 to April 3, 1935 a plan of naval modernization was elaborated, published in the official newspaper on April 6, 1936. Named the "Plan Abad Conde" it included the construction of 12 torpedo boats, 8 minesweepers, 12 submarines, antisubmarine facilities, and arms and others. It also anticipated the modernization existing units in the Navy, beginning with armor and then updating the cruisers and destroyers. The plan amounted to 450 million pesetas to be put into operation over a five-year period, but due to the economic and politicians of the time was out of the question ".
In August 1935, Abad left the Ministry, becoming a university Professor of Philosophy and Law at the University of La Laguna in Tenerife, but later resigned under pressure.

Elżbieta Pleszczyńska

Elżbieta Pleszczyńska (born 20 March 1933) is a Polish full professor of statistics, activist of disability rights movement.
Biography.
M.Sc in mathematics at University of Warsaw, Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in 1956. She held position at Institute of Mathematics PAS until 1972. She received her Ph.D. in 1965 in the area of discriminant analysis ("Power of Test, and Separability of Hypothesis in Statistical Design of Experiments"). Her habilitation thesis, titled "Trend Estimation Problems in Time Series Analysis", was accepted in 1973. 
In 1967/8 she was visiting researcher in University of Wales (Great Britain), and in 1971/2 in University of Montreal. In 1973 she moved to the Institute of Computer Science, PAS. In 1977, 1979 and 1989 she was awarded by the Polish Academy of Science. In 1981 she visited Italy invited by CNR. In the 1990s she started (together with her team) so called grade data analysis, a science of applying copula and rank methods to problems of correspondence and cluster analysis together with outlier detection. (The adjective "grade" here honors statisticians of the first half of the 20th century, who called cumulative distribution functions in this way.) In 1993 the President of the Republic of Poland awarded Elżbieta Pleszczyńska with the Full Professor title in the area of mathematics. In 2000 she was an invited consultant of the Cambridge University.
In the Institute of Computer Science PAS, she had been leader of the Statistical Data Analysis division for many years. According to the Polish law, professors in PAS must retire at the age of 70. Retirement in 2003, although a bit confusing, didn't stop her scientific and social activity.
Scientific views.
Prof. Pleszczyńska is known for her criticism of the classic statistical approach. Classic parametric methods, like Pearson correlation coefficient, or least squares method produce comparable results only for comparable distribution types (in practice multivariate normal distribution is being assumed). Parametric statistical tests are derived from distribution assumptions. Classic methods fail if the input data contain strong outliers, and interpretation of their results should be different for different distribution types. In practice, the underlying assumptions are often not checked, moreover they are always violated – there is no normal distribution in the real world, because every real variable is limited (for example people cannot be –170 cm or +2 km tall), and the normal distribution implies positive probability density for every real number. In most cases the real distribution is skewed or discrete, which doesn't prevent people from using normal distribution methods. The extend of this violation can be measured, but its maximum accepted level is just a convention, not mathematics. The parametric methods always work out of their conditions of use. However, their results are othen considered valid, which leads to "scientific" validation of false hypothesis. For the reasons mentioned above, Elżbieta Pleszczyńska is a strong advocate of explorative data analysis and non-parametric statistics, like Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, or grade data analysis.
Social work.
Elżbieta Pleszczyńska has cofounded Foundation Supporting Physically Disabled Mathematicians and Computer Specialists in Warsaw (September 1990). For many years she has been the Foundation chairman.
The Foundation under her leadership is mainly interested in professional rehabilitation of physically disabled (not only mathematicians and specialists), based on computer techniques, like telework.
Pleszczyńska has been continuously focusing attention of the public opinion on rights of disable people, in her periodical reports.
Private life.
She has a son – journalist – and two grandchildren. She lives in Warsaw Wola district.

Unfortunately, the child was born with a large body as six-year-old kid and the most terrible is that he has two long fangs. (Phra Rahoo, Thai:พระราหู) The king thinks his wife had an affair with an ogre when Ta Sa-nee confessed that she saw Manee-nate hugging and kissing the staute of an ogre. The king abandoned Manee-nate and Phra Rahoo in the forest. Manee-nate and Phra Rahoo were parted for some times. However, the mother and son met again by the hermit's recusement and the mother found out that her son turned into a different person, a beautiful girl called Chinda Mekhala (Thai: จินดาเมขลา) when winter comes and the girl turned in to a handsome boy, called Phra Pirun (Thai: พระพิรุณ) when the rainy season comes, and when summer comes, Phra Rahoo will appear again. The mother and children were protected by two creatures, Monkey-faced human and a stone giant. Despite their happiness, they still faced several dangerous creatures that all became their enemies.
Meanwhile, Manee-nate returned to the empire and explained everything about the children's power to the king. The king banished Ta Sa-nee and her family from their kingdom after realizing that she had lied to him. During the journey Ta Sa-nee met a magical buffalo-man, CoTun, that fell in love with her and dragged her home with him. Years later, they have a son, Sum See, together. Ta Sa-nee wanted Sum See to avenge her and make CoTun train him. When she complained about their home in the cave, CoTun transformed their cave into a castle to please her and named her his queen. He conjured them servants and soldiers. He sent men out to search for her father and old servants and brought him to live with them. Ta Sa-nee was embarrassed by her husband's true nature and told him to not reveal what he really was. 
As the children grew up, they turns into the handsome and beautiful men and woman. Feeling restless, Pirun leaves the kingdom to travel with his demon companion, Yunk. He met a tree nymph/spirit, Latana, and fell in love with her. They spend some nights in her tree home and he told her about his condition. When Pirun transformed into Chinda Mekhala, due to the change in season, Latana begged her to stay with her so she could be with Pirun. Chinda Mekhala explained to her that she couldn't because there are things that she must do. Latana refuse to listen and used her magic to stop her from leaving, but nothing works as Chinda Mekhala was stronger than her. Feeling sorry for the poor nymph, Chinda Mekhala explains to her once again that she must let them go and wait until its Pirun's season to come out.
In Chinda Mekhala's journey, she ran into two men, who are actually the king of gods and his subject posing as humans. She saves them from bandits and they decide to travel with her for safety.
In another kingdom, two beautiful princesses, Umpon and Upsun, are ordered to chose a husband by their parents. Men were called to the castle to let the princesses look at. While Upsun is happy about the occasion, Umpon hated it. Umpon refused to leave her room, but her mother forced her outside to the balcony to see the men.

Meanwhile, two ogres, father and son disguised themselves as human brothers, heard the news and decided to see how the princesses looked liked. They fell in love with the sisters. The father with Umpon. The son with Upsun. The son enchanted her to throw her flower garland to him. He caught and was taken to the back to prepare for the wedding. When the father attempted to enchant Umpon, she dropped her flower garland and the spell accident hit her aunt instead. Seeing his mistake, the ogre back away into the crowd. Her aunt, who was called an old spinster, came out to find herself a husband to stop people from laughing at her. Hit by the spell, she threw her flower garland at the old ogre, and it landed on his head. Reluctantly, he married her.
Chinda Mekhala having recently transformed into Rahoo a few days before, joined the crowd by accident. Seeing his fangs and ogre nature, Umpon threw her flower garland to him. He caught it without knowing what it meant. Umpon's mother is angry at her for choosing an ogre and sent her to like in a small cabin in the woods. Rahoo was madly in love with Umpon, but kept his distance as she's emotional about her parents abandoning her. 
On Upsun's wedding night, her husband is unable to touch her body. When the sisters were young their parents had prayed to the gods to protect their daughters. From then on the girls have a magical protective spell on them that cause evil men to feel a sensation of burning when they touch the girls. This did not happened to Rahoo because he was Umpon's soul mate and truly loves her.
During their marriage, Umpon disliked Rahoo and treated him poorly. She revealed to her sister that she often felt angry when she saw his face. But her anger slowly dissolves as she began to fall in love with him. It is later revealed that Umpon and Rahoo were lovers in their previous life in heaven. She was angry in at him for leaving her and joining his friends to reincarnate. She reincarnated to be with him, but she still had her emotions of anger at his abandoning her.
During those big fighting between the god, giant, nymph, Evil birds and buffalo creature. Phra Pirun lost tree-nymph wife. She was killed by the Ogre in order to help him. However, Chinda Makeala, Phra Rahoo, Phra Pirun still strong and destroy those evil creature with the help of the Supreme God of heaven and recused their parent from the evil. As now, They can break into the different person. Finally, Piroom meet his new wife named Apsorn Sawan (Thai:อัปสรสวรรค์ ) who is a daughter of a king, Rahoo and his wife, Suwan Ampon (Thai:สุวรรณอัมพร ) start their true happiness as his wife now has pregnant and a last couple is Chinda Makela and the Supreme God of heaven whose can live with each other happily without any separation from another.

Pedro Agustín Girón

Pedro Agustín Girón, 4th Marquis de las Amarilas, Duque of Ahumada (1778–1842) was a Spanish military officer and politician. The son of a general, he fought against the French during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the Napoleonic Wars he became a general officer and again fought the French. In later life he held military and political positions.
Biography.
Born into a noble family in San Sebastián in 1778, Pedro Agustín Girón's father was Jerónimo Girón-Moctezuma, 3rd Marquis de las Amarilas and his mother Isabel de las Casas y Aragorri. He was a tenth generation descendant of Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II. He became an official of the "Guardia Real" and participated in the War of the Pyrenees in the Army of Catalonia, in which his father was a high-ranking general. 
After Emperor Napoleon I of France invaded Spain and overthrew the monarchy, Girón offered his services to the patriotic forces in the Peninsular War (also known as the Spanish War of Independence). He participated in the Battle of Bailén in July 1808 where a French corps was annihilated. Later in the year, he fought at the Battle of Tudela in Navarre. In 1809, he served at the Battle of Uclés and in 1811 at the Battle of Albuera. In 1813, the French forces were driven out of Spain after the Battle of Vitoria, which Girón missed because his troops moved in the direction of Bilbao. On 7 October 1813 during the Battle of the Bidassoa, Girón commanded the two Andalusian divisions of Generals Virues and La Torre. Though the Spanish repeatedly attacked the French defenses on Mont Larrun (905 meters alt.), they failed to capture the position. The Marquess of Wellington praised his allies' performance, writing that the Spanish attacked, "in as good order and with as much spirit as any that I have seen made by any troops." The French abandoned the peak the next day to avoid being trapped. Girón also led the two divisions, with 7,653 soldiers in all, at the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November, where his troops helped take the fortified village of Sare. 
When his father died in 1819, Girón became the 4th Marquis of Amarilas. A moderate liberal in the political plain, after the liberal revolution of 1820, he was named Minister of the War of the Government under Evaristo Pérez de Castro. However he resigned in just a few months because of the opposition of the more radical liberal sector. 
In 1832, in the last years of the reign of Fernando VII, he was designated Commander in chief of Granada. The following year he was bestowed the title Duque de Ahumada. In 1835 he was named Minister of the War again, but was forced to resign after being accused of nepotism. During the last few years of his life he spent many years abroad and traveled, and dedicated his time to study and writing. His memoirs "Memories 1778-1837" offers an insight into his life. He died in 1842.
Pedro's son, Francisco Javier Girón y Ezpeleta, 2nd duque de Ahumada and 5th marqués de las Amarillas, founded the Spanish Guardia Civil in 1844.

Die Schweizer Familie

Die Schweizer Familie ("The Swiss Family") is an opera by the Austrian composer Joseph Weigl. It takes the form of a "Singspiel" in three acts. The libretto, by Ignaz Franz Castelli, is based on the vaudeville "Pauvre Jacques" (1807) by Charles-Augustin de Basson-Pierre und René André Polydore Chazet. The opera was first performed at the Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna on 14 March 1809 and was a great success in German-speaking countries in the early 19th century.
Synopsis.
The Bolls, the Swiss family of the title, have been banished to an unspecified region in the Alps. Their daughter, Emmeline, pines away for love of Jakob, to whom she is secretly engaged. The local count, whose life was saved by Richard Boll, also shows concern for Emmeline's sufferings and with his help Emmeline and Jakob are reunited.
Legacy.
Ignaz Moscheles wrote a set of 12 variations for piano (Op. 5) on the air "Wer hörte wohl jemals mich klagen".

Haworthia fasciata

Haworthia fasciata is a species in the genus "Haworthia". It is sometimes referred to as zebra cactus.
The plants are generally small, less than 10 cm (4 in) high. The triangular shaped leaves are dark green with narrow white crested strips on the outside. At the end of the leaf is a non acute spine. The species has very similar markings to "Haworthia attenuata", both of which are commonly grown as house plants. Flowers appear in summer on the end of an inflorescence.
It is often confused with "Aloe aristata" because of their similar appearance, although "H. fasciata" is ultimately smaller after reaching maturity.

Magnesium hydride

Magnesium hydride is the chemical compound MgH2. It contains 7.66% by weight of hydrogen and has been studied as a potential hydrogen storage medium.
Preparation.
In 1951 preparation from the elements was first reported involving direct hydrogenation of Mg metal at high pressure and temperature (200 atmospheres, 500 °C) with MgI2 catalyst:
Lower temperature production from Mg and H2 using nano crystalline Mg produced in ball mills has been investigated. Other preparations include:
Structure and bonding.
The room temperature form β-MgH2 has a rutile structure. There are two high pressure forms, α-MgH2 with α-PbO2 structure and γ-MgH2. Additionally a non stoichiometric MgH(2-δ) has been characterised, but this appears to exist only for very small particles (bulk MgH2 is essentially stoichiometric, as it can only accommodate very low concentrations of H vacancies). 
The bonding in the rutile form is sometimes described as being covalent in nature rather than purely ionic; charge density determination by synchrotron x-ray diffraction indicates that the magnesium atom is fully ionised and spherical in shape and the hydride ion is elongated.
Molecular forms of magnesium hydride, MgH, MgH2, Mg2H, Mg2H2, Mg2H3, and Mg2H4 molecules identified by their vibrational spectra have been found in matrix isolated samples at below 10 K, formed following laser ablation of magnesium in the presence of hydrogen. The Mg2H4 molecule has a bridged structure analogous to dimeric aluminium hydride, Al2H6.
Reactions.
MgH2 readily reacts with water to form hydrogen gas:
At 300 °C decomposes to produce H2 at 1 bar pressure, the high temperature required is seen as a limitation in the use of MgH2 as a reversible hydrogen storage medium:
Potential use for hydrogen storage.
Its potential as a reversible "storage" medium for hydrogen has led to interest in improving the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction kinetics. This can be partially achieved by doping or by reducing the particle size using ball milling. An alternative approach under investigation is the production of a pumpable slurry of MgH2 which is safe to handle and releases H2 by reaction with water, with reprocessing of the Mg(OH)2 into MgH2.An application (yet to be examined) for a US Patent (US 2010/0163434 A1) [http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=6-nRAAAAEBAJ has been made in respect of a hydrogen energy storage system using laser excitation to assist desorption of hydrogen gas from magnesium hydride.

Santiago Alba y Bonifaz

Santiago Alba Bonifaz (23 December 1872, Zamora – 8 April 1949) was a Spanish politician and lawyer. He served as Minister of the Navy, Minister of Education and Science, Minister of the Interior, Minister of Housing, and Minister of Foreign Affairs during the reign of Alfonso XIII. 
Born to a middle class family with important political connections, he was the son of Obdulia Bonifaz (a relative of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla) and of César Alba García Oyuelos, a prominent Valladolid lawyer. Alba grew up in Valladolid and studied at the university, receiving a law degree. He also began working for the "La Opinión" as editor-in-chief, and later bought the newspaper "El Norte de Castilla" in 1893, where he had also worked as a manager. 
Upon the death of her husband, Alba’s mother inherited an estate in Cantabria, in the town of Noja. When Alba became the first Marquis of Albaicín, the estate became the Palacio del Albaicín. In 1918, after suffering from an accident in which his car crashed into a tree, he spent some time there recuperating.
He married Enriqueta Delibes in 1897 and began his political career in the elections of 1901, as a representative of the party Unión Nacional, earning a seat in the Cortes as deputy for Valladolid province. He won the seat again in the 1903 elections—after switching to the Partido Liberal—but would give up his seat to become Subsecretary of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, and in the elections of 1905, he would again give up his seat in order to become Governor of the Bank of Spain. In succeeding elections, which were held until 1936, he would again be elected deputy representing Valladolid, Granada, or Zamora provinces. From 1933 to 1936, he was President of the Cortes. 
Ministry.
He served as Minister of the Navy from 30 November to 4 December 1906 in the government of Segismundo Moret. He was Minister of Public Education and Belles Artes on two occasions: from 12 March to 31 December 1912 under José Canalejas; and from 22 March to 10 October 1918 under Antonio Maura. 
He was Minister of the Interior on two occasions: from 31 December 1912 to 27 October 1913 and from 9 December to 30 October 1916, both times under the Count of Romanones. 
He served as Minister of Housing from 30 April 1916 to 11 June 1917 under Romanotes and García Prieto, and adopted the ideas of the movement known as Regeneracionismo. He enacted two programs. The first, proposed “in defense of Spanish values,” prohibited the issuing, introduction, and announcement in the Spanish market of debt securities and bonds associated with foreign governments. The second program reformed laws for tenants in Spain. He later presented to the Cortes some 22 projects concerning administrative and financial reorganizations and reforms, tax law reforms, monopolies, and economic development. 
He also successfully enacted a government loan worth billions of pesetas. 
During his second term as Minister of Housing (9 November - 5 December 1918), he concerned himself with food supply and transportation issues caused by the First World War. He proposed some agrarian reforms, but these were not carried out. 
He then served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 7 December 1922 to 15 September 1923 in a new cabinet under García Prieto. 
During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Alba exiled himself to France but returned in Spain in 1930. He refused to serve as head of the government after the fall of Dámaso Berenguer. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, he again exiled himself, this time to Portugal. He returned to Spain in 1945 but no longer involved himself in politics.

<doc id="18782017" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18782017" title="Carangoides ciliarius">
Carangoides ciliarius

Carangoides ciliarius is a dubious species of marine fish in the jack and horse mackerel family, Carangidae. The validity of the species has been questioned by a number of authors, with many concluding it is a synonym of the similar "Carangoides armatus", commonly known as the longfin trevally. However, this synonymy has not been accepted by all authorities, with Fishbase and ITIS both recognising it as a valid species. Like "Carangoides armatus", the species is occasionally referred to as the 'longfin kingfish'.
Taxonomy.
The species, as it is currently recognised, was scientifically described and named by the German naturalist Eduard Rüppell in 1830, based on the holotype specimen taken from Massawa in the Red Sea. Rüppell named the fish "Citula ciliaria", placing the species in what was at the time a valid genus of jacks. As the classification of the carangids was reviewed, "Citula" was synonymised with "Pseudocaranx", with "C. ciliaria" transferred to "Carangoides", and the specific name changed from "ciliaria" to "ciliarius", leading to the currently accepted combination. There is a possibility that Peter Forsskål described and named the species earlier, in 1775, which would make him the correct author under ICZN rules. He named a species "Sciaena armata", but the description has been too vague to make any certain conclusions, and this name is considered a "nomen dubium" that cannot hold priority, and placed in synonymy with "C. ciliarius". 
Georges Cuvier independently renamed the species as "Caranx citula" in 1833, also making reference to the name "Caranx cirrhosus" as a synonym of his new name. This name was apparently coined by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, although never properly published. These two names are considered to be junior synonyms under ICZN naming rules and are no longer valid.
Synonymy with "Carangoides armatus".
There has been extensive confusion in the ichthyological literature between "C. ciliarius" and "C. armatus". Rüppell described both 'species' in the same volume, and a 1973 paper by Margret Smith concluded he merely described both a young and an old individual of the same species. She recommended that "C. ciliarius" be given priority due to the fact it appears first in the book. A similar mistake involving misidentification of age stages apparently occurred in a 1937 analysis of carangids by Yojiro Wakiya, who divided "C. armatus" into four separate species, one of them being "C. ciliarius". The most recent investigation into this taxonomic problem occurred in 1980, when Williams and Venkataramani confirmed synonymy between "C. armatus" and "C. ciliarius", but recommended the name "Carangoides armatus" be kept.
Most modern publications now list "C. ciliarius" as a synonym of "C. armatus", with the last major revision of Indo-Pacific carangids also reaffirming this. Nevertheless, two major taxonomic authorities, Fishbase and ITIS, list the species as valid based on the California Academy of Sciences Catalog of Fishes, which itself comments that it may be synonymous with "Carangoides armatus". This name is occasionally used in non-scientific literature such as fishing publications, although the common name given to the fish, 'longfin kingfish', is also applied to "Carangoides armatus".

Ingolstadt–Kralupy–Litvínov pipeline

The Ingolstadt–Kralupy–Litvínov pipeline (also known as IKL pipeline and MERO pipeline) is a crude oil pipeline in Central Europe. It allows the transport of crude oil from Germany to the Czech oil refineries of Kralupy and Litvínov. The name of the Ingolstadt–Kralupy–Litvínov pipeline is a misnomer, as the pipeline does not start in Ingolstadt and does not run to Kralupy and Litvínov.
History.
Negotiations to construct the Ingolstadt–Kralupy–Litvínov pipeline started in October 1990 and were concluded in 1992. Originally, the pipeline was planned to run from Ingolstadt to Litvínov, but the route was changed to run from Vohburg to Nelahozeves. However, the original name of the pipeline was kept.
Construction of the pipeline started on 1 September 1994 and was completed in December 2005. It was inaugurated on 13 March 1996. It is the main pipeline in the Czech Republic allowing oil supplies other than those of Russian origin. In 2003, the pipeline was modernized by improving remote control systems and increasing capacity.
Route.
The pipeline starts from Vohburg in Germany, where it is connected with the Transalpine Pipeline, and ends at the oil depot in Nelahozeves near Prague in the Czech Republic. The German section of the pipeline is and the Czech section is long.
Technical description.
The pipeline has a diameter of , and the pressure varies from in Vohburg to in Nelahozeves. The capacity of the pipeline is around ten million tonnes per year, of which normally 30% is in use. The additional capacity is reserved for securing oil supplies in case of disruption of Russian supplies through the Druzhba pipeline, as happened in July 2008. The control center, which controls the whole pipeline, is located in Vohburg. The backup control center is located in Nelahozeves.
The tank farm in Vohburg consists of four tanks, with a total capacity of . The tank farm in Nelahozeves, serving the IKL and Druzhba pipelines, consists of ten tanks with a total capacity of .
Operating company.
The pipeline is operated by MERO Pipeline GmbH.

She was New Zealand's first female Olympic athlete and at 15 years 178 days the youngest swimming competitor at the 1920 Olympics. Walrond competed in two events at the Olympics. In the 100 metre freestyle race she came 5th in the final (untimed) after placing 3rd in her heat in a time of 1:21.4. In the 300 metre freestyle race she came 7th (although New Zealand newspapers said she was 6th, and some publications said she did not start due to illness) in the final (untimed) after finishing second in her heat in 5:04.6. This is the only Olympics to have a 300 metres women's freestyle race as it was replaced in 1924 by the 400 metres freestyle. She used the "crawl" style.
Walrond's father, Cecil 'Tui' Walrond, was a noted swimmer who received a Royal Humane Society award for rescuing 11 people from drowning. He accompanied her to the Olympics as chaperone and unofficial team trainer. Violet and her younger sister Edna retired from competitive swimming in 1923 when Violet was 18. She later stated that they retired on orders from their father, as "he felt that we were too much in the public eye". He also forbade them from cutting their long hair short. 
She married Harold Robb in 1933, and died in 1996 aged 91, in Papakura, Auckland.

He founded the newspaper "La Sanidad Civil" in order to vindicate the rights of medical professionals, and were funded by the state. In 1920 he was elected to chair the History of Medicine at the University of Alcala but without success and later distanced himself from university life. From his early 20s he began publishing medical literature and philosophy. His notable works of his first 20 years in the profession are shown below in his works.
Mexico.
In the 1920s he continued his activity in Mexico, in the Mexican capital, where he established his own clinic. He became acquainted with the Hispanic-American way of life and attended many conferences, publishing a multitude of new works and three autobiographical novels "Sol de Levante" (Gerardo Sisniega, México, 1923), "Aventuras Tropicales. En busca del oro verde" (Madrid, 1928) and "Bajo el cielo mejicano"" (Cía. Ibero-Americana de Publicaciones Madrid, 1930). 
His time in Mexico was marred by political unrest and violence. Madero had been assassinated in 1913, Emiliano Zapata in 1919, Pancho Villa in 1923 and Carranza in 1920. Farmers revolts, coup d'etats and crime became the political norm. Obregón was assassinated in 1928 and the Cristero War broke out with the cristeros representing the aspiration of the Mexican Catholics. Such was the mistrust of foreigners during this period, that Albinana was later expelled from the country under Plutarco Elías Calles
Burgos delegate.
Albiñana returned to Spain in Burgos where he was later elected as its delegate in 1934, and reelected in 1936, although by this time his Valencian accent had become mixed with a Mexican accent causing some suspicion. Over time he gained the trust of the people in Burgos, catering to the needs of the neighbourhoods in Burgos and readily answering questions. He brought about a number of infrastructural developments in Burgos including the legal work for the Compañía de Aguas de Burgos (Burgos Water Company), installation of the telephone in Villarcayo and Medina de Pomar, instalación and the creation of Burgos Airport, securing important subsidies and investors to develop the regio.
Assassination and tribute.
He was murdered by militia men when these took over the Carcel Modelo along with other prominent politicians. With the triumph of the pro-Franco side, streets in several localities, mainly in his native Valencia were dedicated to him.

DRG Kleinlokomotive Class II

German "Kleinlokomotiven" (literally: small locomotives) like the DRG Kö II (later: Köf II) were developed as locomotives with a low weight and driving power for light shunting duties. There were two classes, based on engine power. The Class II were engines which developed more than 40 (later 50) PS. 
After tests with several trial locomotives, they were placed in service from 1932 onwards by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) and used on small stations for light shunting and marshalling work. They were intended to make the handling of goods traffic more economical. To do that an appropriately trained controller had to be able to handle shunting duties using the locomotive. Accordingly the locomotive was designed to be robust and easy to operate.
Technology.
Light locomotives mainly used diesel motors (originally classified as "Kö/Köf/Köe" by the DRG), as their source of energy, but there were also versions with Benzolmotors, designated as "Kb/Kbf/Kbe", and with electrical batteries (accumulator cars: "Ks/Ka"), as well as one locomotive with a steam engine. The third letter indicated the type of power transmission. If there wasn't one, the locomotive had a gear system. An "f" stood for an hydraulic drive and an "e" for electric traction motors, that were fed by a generator. Köf, therefore, stood for a light locomotive ("Kleinlok") with diesel ("Öl-(Diesel-)Motor") engine and hydraulic transmission ("Flüssigkeitsgetriebe").
The locomotive is very small and yet of , standard gauge, size, but only fills about half the loading gauge profile. As a result, it can be loaded onto flat wagons. That was necessary, because if it had to move under its own power, its top speed of only would have seriously held up rail traffic. It is driven by a diesel engine, that works through a mechanical gear transmission system and dry clutch. Power is transmitted to the axles using a chain linkage.
The light diesel locomotives were the first German diesel engines that were built in batches by several manufacturers.
They were initially divided into two power groups:
In the DR and DB over 100 new Köf II engines were further developed and built after the war. In the DR over 60 vehicles were produced and referred to as N4 by the manufacturers. These resembled the classical light locomotive very closely, but had a side rod drive. The first real development of the Köf in the GDR was the V15/V23. As in the DB, a decision was made to build a Köf III. This plan was subsequently discarded and replaced by the DR V60 project.
The DB later developed a Köf III with up to . In 1987, the Class 260/261 (up to 1968 called V 60) engines were classified as light locomotives.
The brake effort of the Kö was initially only the weight of the engine driver and the maximum force he could transmit via the brake pedal. With the introduction of new, more powerful motors (up to ) and the corresponding increase in tractive effort this proved far too little; as a result many light locos in the DB and DR were equipped with a compressed-air brake, that could also operated the brakes of attached wagons. In the DB the permitted top speed was raised from where compressed-air brakes had been installed. These locos can be easily recognised by their air reservoirs on the front. Because the open cab gave no real protection from the weather in winter, these were added during the course of main inspections from the late 1950s.
Classifications.
Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft: power category ("Leistungsgruppe") II, Kb/Kö/Köf/Kbf 4001 to 6047
Deutsche Bundesbahn: continued production of Köf II up to Köf 6835
Deutsche Bundesbahn: in 1968 redesignated as Class 321-324
Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany): new models Kö 4002 to 4032
Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany): in 1970 redesignated as Class 100
Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany): in 1973, narrow gauge Kö redesignated as Class 199
Deutsche Bahn AG: in 1992 DR Class 100 redesignated as DBAG Class 310
Preserved Locomotives.
Deutsche Bundesbahn/Deutsche Bahn AG.
In the 1980s numerous Köf IIs were still in service with the DB and DR (some over 50 years old. For a while, DB 323 412 and 323 415 were the oldest locomotives in the Deutsche Bundesbahn), as well as a handful of battery-operated light locos, of classes 381 and 382. Since 1999 no Köf IIs have worked for the Deutsche Bahn AG. However many remain working for other railway companies and societies, both in regular services and as museum locomotives.
East German Deutsche Reichsbahn.
In 1970 the Deutsche Reichsbahn incorporated 378 machines of power category 2 in its EDP classification scheme as Class 100. After German reunification these became Class 310 in the DB AG. Only a few of the DR's light locomotives had hydraulic power transmission; they were grouped into sub-class 100.8. Under the old numbering scheme they were classified as "Köf". Dead man's handles ("Sifa") and radios for marshalling were not common. The Deutsche Reichsbahn converted many Kö to compressed-air brakes, this programme had not been completed when the Berlin Wall came down.
In 1983/84 three DR Kö II were converted to metre gauge working for the Halle industrial railway and the Harz Narrow Gauge Railway. They have been preserved.

Alejandro Agag

Alejandro Tarik Agag Longo was born in Madrid on 18 September 1970 to an Algerian Belgian father Youssef Agag, who was a banker, and a Spanish mother.
Agag graduated in Economics and Business studies from the Colegio Universitario de Estudios Financieros (CUNEF) in Madrid and is fluent in four languages, Spanish, English, French and Italian.
Agag, a Spanish businessman and former politician, is currently based in London as the Chairman of Addax Capital LLP. His present interests lie in the fields of finance, advertising and sports.
Political career.
Agag’s political career began when, at the early age of 18, he became a member of Nuevas Generaciones (NNGG) the youth organization of the main center-right Spanish party Partido Popular, which at the time was in the opposition. Having been actively involved in politics while at University, he quickly moved up the ranks of the youth structure of the party, joining, due to his knowledge of languages, the international relations department.
During that time Agag travelled extensively representing NNGG in organizations such as DEMYC and EYCD, center-right parties from Europe and the world that brought together youth political branches. Agag was elected International Secretary of NNGG at their congress in 1994.
In the same year Agag graduated in economics and was offered the position of Deputy Secretary General of the European People’s Party. An offer that was as a direct result of the election – a few months earlier – of the German Klaus Welle as Secretary General. Welle and Agag met in the youth organizations level, and Welle took Agag with him to the EPP – Agag was 23 at the time. That year, Agag also ran for a seat in the European Parliament, he campaigned in towns and villages in Extremadura; he was not elected at this time.
As deputy secretary general, Agag was in charge of coordinating the different policy working groups within the EPP, and drafting of policy papers to be presented at the congress. As DSG Agag was a member of the EPP Summit, which meets before the European Council meetings and includes all of EPP’s Heads of State and Government.
In 1996 the Center-right won the elections in Spain, and Agag was offered the position to become designated aid of the President of the Government, José María Aznar. The President had three aides, one diplomat, one military and one political (Agag). He was 25 at the time, and spent three years in that position.
In 1999, at 28 years of age, he was elected MEP. He entered the Economic and Monetary affairs commission, focusing in antitrust policy. In 2000 he led the Parliaments report on antitrust policy, and was active in redrafting the present antitrust rules.
Earlier that year he had also been elected Secretary General of the European People's Party, replacing his colleague Klaus Welle. During his mandate as SG the organization expanded to the east of Europe, during that period it incorporated more than 20 new political parties from the region. Later that year, for the first time, the EPP won the European Parliament elections and became the largest political force in Europe.
Agag was also very active in Italy. Making a controversial decision, and against some member parties within the organization, he pushed for the acceptance of Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi’s party, into the EPP. This was of help to Berlusconi, who went on to win the elections in Italy in 2001. That year Agag intervened in the closing campaign rally of Forza Italia in Rome.
In 2000 Agag was elected in Mexico Secretary General of the Christian Democratic International, renamed at that meeting Centrist Democratic International. This global political organization has over 90 member parties from all over the world.
In 2001, Agag made a decision to cease his political activities in order to furtherance a career in business and sporting activities. The following year he was succeeded at the EPP by an old fellow during his times with Aznar: Antonio López-Istúriz
Business career.
In 2002 Agag moved to London and started his own consultancy firm. He has been very active in multiple fields, including Telecoms, Energy, and especially Media. Agag expanded his activities to financial advisory and fund management, forming a company called Addax Capital LLP, which is regulated by the FSA. Agag is currently Chairman of Addax and was joined in 2009 by Ignacio Muñoz Alonso, former CEO of Rothschild Bank in Spain,who worked for Lehman brothers before that.Addax culture is deeply rooted in the values of long standing relationships, trust, discretion and technical excellence.
In 2007, the "Financial Times" named him as one of the 10 "shakers and movers" of the Spanish economy, and he was described as a "political hopeful, economist, banker and indefatigable dealmaker".
Agag is frequently mentioned in the media for his extensive range of contacts, both political and business, from all over the world. The Spanish newspaper ‘El Pais’ once described his Nokia SIM Card as "Priceless".
In 2008, GQ Magazine elected him as the Spanish "Businessman of the Year."
Sports : Formula 1, Formula E, GP2 and Football.
Agag business activity within sports, mainly focuses on motorsport and football. According to the Spanish newspaper ‘El Pais’, Agag, together with Flavio Briatore, acquired very early on the Formula One T.V. rights for Spain. This was achieved via a U.K. based company and played a key role in the huge expansion of Formula One in Spain where television audiences have multiplied over the past few years. Agag is also very heavily involved in the ‘sponsorship’ side of the business, he is said to be behind some of the major deals lately achieved in the sport.
Agag owns the Barwa Addax GP2 Series Team which won the title in 2008 and was runner-up in 2009. He took over the Team from former F1 driver, Adrián Campos, in mid-2007. The team’s main sponsor is the Qatari real estate company, Barwa. Three drivers from Addax, Romain Grosjean, Vitaly Petrov and Lucas di Grassi, have made it to the F1. In 2010, Agag started competing in GP3 with the Addax GP3 Team.
Through his connection within sport, Agag has formed friendships with Flavio Briatore, Bernie Ecclestone and Lakshmi Mittal. Together, they bought the English football club Queens Park Rangers in 2007.
Agag served as Chairman of QPR for a few months during the take-over. Following which he remained in the Club as a shareholder. THE PLAN, as declared by Flavio Briatore, was to get QPR promoted to the English Premier League. A feat that was achieved in 2011.
He is currently promoting the Formula E Championship. The inaugural season will begin on September 2014 and will last till June 2015. Formula E Holdings, whose CEO is Alejandro Agag, has set up races in ten different cities around the world.
Personal life.
On 5 September 2002 Agag married Ana Aznar Botella, the daughter of José María Aznar. The wedding was very much criticized since it was presented as a governmental event despite the fact that neither the bride nor the groom were members of the government and took place at El Escorial in Madrid and was attended by more than a thousand guests, among them the King and Queen of Spain, the Prime Ministers of Italy and the United Kingdom, as well as numerous other prominent politicians and celebrities.
Agag has four children, Alejandro, Rodrigo, Pelayo and Alonso and currently lives in London.

HP 64000

The HP 64000, introduced circa 1980, is a tool for developing hardware and software for products based on commercial microcomputers. The earliest commercial 64000 development systems contain from one to six 64100A Development Stations sharing a hard drive and line printer. This arrangement allowed up to six designers and engineers to use their workstations together, sharing the HPIB instrumentation bus and a hard drive and a line printer. This was an innovative feature of the 64000 development system since other systems of the era used a timesharing system with a single system processor and memory, making for a more expensive and less flexible development system.
Description.
The 64000 system is a complete emulation system consisting of a microprocessor emulator, a memory emulator, a logic analyzer, and a software package that interacts with the integrated hardware to form a complete development tool.
The three interfaces that comprise a 64000 system are as follows:
Examine the functional diagram of the HP 64000 system to the right which illustrates the interaction between various system components.
Microprocessor emulator.
The emulation systems available consists of two subsystems, 1) an external emulation pod which contains the target microprocessor and 2) an internal expansion card called the emulation control board which controls the microprocessor in the pod and interfaces it to the system timing and control signals of the 64100A workstation.
Emulator pods.
These are pods external to the 64100A and 64110 mainframe. The pod is connected to a matching control board in the card cage by 2 sometimes 3 flat cables. 
It may also be connected to a target computer system's processors socket by a 40-pin plug for 8 bit processors or a 64-pin plugin for processors like the 68000 or 68010 64-pin dip socket.
The following is a list of available emulator pods for various target microprocessor systems.
Emulator control board.
The control board which controls the interface to the pods is installed in the 64100A internal card cage. This emulator control board consists of:
The following table of available controller boards lists various target architectures for particular controllers. Given the generalized design features of the 64000 system, some controller boards are compatible with more than one microprocessor family.

Alonso III Fonseca

Alonso III Fonseca (Santiago de Compostela, 1475–1534) was a Galician archbishop and politician. He was archbishop of Santiago de Compostela from 1507, and archbishop of Toledo from 1523. He was a major supporter of the University of Santiago de Compostela. He was the son of the archbishop and Alonso II's concubine María de Ulloa.
His older brother was Diego II de Acevedo, first Count of Andrade. They had different surnames because a younger son (i.e. Alonso III Fonseca) would take the surname of his father (“Fonseca”) and the older son would take the name of his grandmother (the mother of his father the archbishop), which was “Acevedo.”
Early life and career as Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela.
As archbishop, he was forced to confront Condado de Altamira, , because the count was meddling in the affairs of the "Tierras de Santiago", and also put a stop to the injustices committed by the governors there, taking advantage of his close relations with the Spanish monarchy as well as the papacy. He was also involved in lawsuits against the Benedictine monks of San Martín Pinario, during a resurgence of this religious order in Galicia.
He presided over his father’s funeral in 1512, at which Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, known as "The Great Captain", attended, and Fernández de Córdoba symbolically offered his weapons to Saint James the Great ("Santiago") at the funeral.
Political career.
He assumed the leadership of the Galician nobility, who wished to maintain their privileges, and was named by Charles V as a member of the Royal Council. The Galician nobility was not included in the "Cortes" (Legislature) of Santiago and the "Cortes" of A Coruña, and Fonseca led the fight for their inclusion in these legislative bodies. Fonseca presided over an assembly at Melide, whose aims for the Kingdom of Galicia included demands for legislative representation and a new board of trade ("casa de contratación") based at A Coruña. He also served as a mediator in the War of the Germanías.
Archbishop of Toledo.
In 1523, he was named Archbishop of Toledo, and in this position, served as a patron to scholars, artists, and humanists. He baptized Philip II of Spain in May 1527. His main place of residence was at Alcalá de Henares, where he died on February 4, 1534. He was buried at Salamanca.
He had a son, the result of an affair with the noblewoman Juana de Pimentel. Fonseca's son later served the Spanish king and inherited property in Galicia.
Legacy.
The definitive consolidation of the University of Santiago de Compostela comes with Fonseca. Fonseca was an extremely erudite man, a Renaissance man and patron of numerous artists of the time, who was in touch with important thinkers such as Erasmus of Rotterdam. Around 1507 the old Pilgrim's Hospital in Santiago de Compostela was purchased with the aim of transforming it into a university college. The Santiago Alfeo College, today known as the Fonseca College, was also built, which became the centre of the university life till the second half of the 18th century and still remains emblematic in today's university.

William Magennis

William Magennis (18 May 1867 – 30 March 1946) was an Irish politician and university professor. 
Born in Belfast, he was educated at Belvedere College, Dublin, and University College Dublin. In 1893 he was called to the Bar. He was professor of philosophy at Carysfort College and he held the Chair of Metaphysics at University College Dublin.
Political career.
Magennis was first elected to Dáil Éireann as an independent Teachta Dála (TD) for the National University of Ireland constituency at the 1922 general election. He was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD for the same constituency at the 1923 general election.
In 1926, he was one of the founders of a new political party called Clann Éireann. The party advocated the abolition of the Oath of Allegiance to the British King, called for lower taxes and less legislation and was critical of the report of the Boundary Commission. The party attracted little support and it did not win any seats at the June 1927 general election, including the loss of Magennis' seat. He was nominated by the Taoiseach to the 2nd Seanad in 1938 and served as an independent member until his death in 1946.
Views on censorship of films and books.
Speaking during the debate of the 1923 Censorship of Films Act, which was one of the first pieces of significant legislation to be passed by the Irish Free State. Magennis declared: ""Purity of mind and sanity of outlook upon life were long ago regarded as characteristic of our people. The loose views and the vile lowering of values that belong to other races and other peoples were being forced upon our people through the popularity of the cinematograph"".
In 1942 Magennis spoke against the publication of obscene books such as "The Tailor and Ansty", adding that his moral standards "... do not date back to Queen Victoria's days; they date back to Moses. The standards under which we operate go back to 1,500 years or so before Christ. If the Senator cares to accuse us of being old-fashioned, I am pleading guilty: I am so old-fashioned as to take my standards of life and conduct from Mount Sinai and not from Seán This and Seán That, whose books have been banned."
In the ensuing debates it emerged that, while Magennis disapproved of sodomy, he did not know what it was. His opponent Senator Keane pointed out that two men embracing in "Land of Spices" did not amount to sodomy, adding: "I think he might have used something less strong".

Diego de Alvear y Ponce de León

Diego de Alvear y Ponce de León (1749–1830) was a Spanish military commander and politician. 
A grandson of the founder of the "Alvear" wine company of Montilla, he was the father of the Argentine politician Carlos María de Alvear, grandfather of another Argentine politician, Torcuato de Alvear, and great-grandfather of Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, the president of Argentina between 1922 and 1928. 
He took the name of his grandfather, Diego de Alvear y Escalera, the founder of Alvear. Ponce de León belonged, therefore, to an important family of wine growers in Andalusia.
Political and military career in the colonies.
He studied in Jesuit schools, first in Montilla and later at Granada, until the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. After entering the Spanish navy as midshipman (1770), he arrived at the Rio de la Plata in 1774 and fought in the "Sacramento War" (also known as "Ceballos Expedition" 1776-1777). Its name derives from a colonial conflict between Spain and Portugal for control of Colonia del Sacramento in what today is Uruguay, where the Spanish forces were commanded by Pedro de Cevallos. After a favorable resolution to Spanish interests, Charles III created the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata and named general Pedro de Cevallos as viceroy.
It was on this new viceroyalty where Diego de Alvear y Ponce de León lived for almost thirty years. He continued his ascending military career reaching the rank of general and in 1781 wed María Balbastro, with whom he had nine children.
Among the works during this stage in his life, he worked on the delineation of the border between Spanish and Portuguese territories. It was an endeavor started by king Charles III, where political objectives and military ideals where mixed. After the aforementioned colonial conflict, both kingdoms decided to clearly mark the borders of their colonial possessions. Charles III ordered that to accomplish this task, they had to divide the border in five sections to be studied separately. Diego de Alvear received command of the task for one of these sections to be studied, which encompassed the areas around the Paraná and Paraguay rivers. Here he spent 18 years (1782–1800) doing Topography work, botanic studies and preparing reports on the Tupi and Guarani peoples.
Battle of Cabo Santa María.
On August 7, 1804 Diego de Alvear, already a general, embarked in Montevideo en route to Spain in the frigate "Mercedes" carrying with him the riches accumulated after those many years of service in the River Plate area, and also his wife and children. The flotilla, headed for Cádiz, was composed of four frigates commanded by José de Bustamante y Guerra.
On October 5, 1804 on the so-called Battle of Cabo de Santa Maria, near the Portuguese coast of Algarve, the Spanish ships were met by a British flotilla, and even though both countries were at peace after the Treaty of Amiens, they threatened the Spaniards. Diego Alvear and his son Carlos María were called to the flagship "Medea", to serve as interpreters as they spoke English. The incident got out of hand when an intimidating British carronade hit the "Mercedes", which sank, carrying with her Don Diego's riches and the life of his wife and children. The only surviving son was Carlos María, who was with him. Two months later, in December 1804, Spain declared war on Great Britain.
Second marriage and return to Spain.
After the sinking of the "Mercedes", the flotilla was captured and sailed to England where Diego de Alvear was made prisoner, but with honours and privileges. The tragic family loss was not lost on the British to the point that the British government decided to reimburse don Diego part of his economic losses due to the sinking of the "Mercedes".
During his captivity he met, going to mass, the young Irish Luisa Ward, whom he would later marry and have ten children. In December 1805 he returned to Spain and in 1806 arrived in Madrid. As said Diego de Alvear married Luisa on January 20, 1807, in Montilla (Córdoba, Spain). from tommy bergman
Spanish War of Independence and defense of Cádiz.
In August 1807, Alvear was put in charge of the artillery units defending the city of Cádiz, where he would distinguish himself defending the city from the French troops, who had invaded Spain in 1808.
Diego de Alvear organized the city's defenses, having been one of his first successes to get the French Rosilly flotilla, interned in Cádiz Bay until then (as until a month and a half before France had been an ally) surrender on June 1808. Another important task was the reorganization of Cádiz's militias, a corps of two thousand volunteers called the "Distinguished Volunteers of Cádiz".
On March 1810, Diego de Alvear was named military governor of the Isle of León (today San Fernando) and his success at the defense of Cádiz would get him the "Gran Cruz de Hermenegildo" decoration. The writer José de Espronceda would later dedicate a poem to him: "To Don Diego de "Alvearthomas bergman"".
Ferdinand VII reign: fight between liberals and absolutists.
After the War of Independence, Diego de Alvear requested permission to travel to England. The request was accepted and he lived in Great Britain between 1814 and 1817. Upon his return in 1817, he lived as a recluse in Montilla in the family's wine growing business, even though the political events of the country would lead him to actively participate once more. In 1820 Spain instituted the "Trienio Liberal" and in 1821 a series of movements by military forces quartered in Córdoba would try to reinstate absolutist power. Diego de Alvear was opposed to this and organized a volunteer militia in Montilla, resisting the absolutist rebels until the arrival of reinforcements which ended the movement. As an award for his actions, he was named in 1822 Commander of the Montilla Militia and in 1823 he returned to Cádiz.
The restoration of absolutism in 1823 forced him to return to Montilla, be detained and released several times and caused a serious economic loss. He also lost, and had reinstated his titles and honours in several occasions, at the whim of the crown, until 1829 when he finally recuperates all his titles and honors. He died in Madrid, on January 15, 1830.
A man of culture.
Don Diego spoke several languages: Spanish, Latin, English, French, Italian, Portuguese and some Tupí and Guaraní, having learned these two latter ones during his geographic work in the colonial sector he commanded. He also had great mathematical and astronomical knowledge, connected with his military activities in the navy and army artillery and the work he did delimiting the colonial possession borders between Spain and Portugal in the River Plate area.
He wrote several books, including "Descripción de Buenos Aires" ("Descriptions of Buenos Aires") and "Demarcación de los territorios de España y Portugal" ("demarcation between the territories of Spain and Portugal").
Modern times: the finding of the wreck of the "Mercedes".
The wreck of the frigate "Mercedes", whose sinking caused the death of Alvear's first wife and his children, was recently found and salvaged by the treasure hunter company Odyssey Marine Exploration between March and May 2007. This company, using Gibraltar as base, has recovered enormous quantities of silver and gold coins, plus cannon and copper ingots from the wreck. Most of these were sent to the USA by cargo plane from Gibraltar. The Spanish government has sued the company on this issue.

Andrés Amado Reygondaud

Andrés Amado Reygondaud (1886 - 1960) was a Spanish politician and lawyer.
With José Calvo Sotelo he was active in the Ministry of Finance during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, and took the overall leadership of the Ministry. It was Amado Reygondaud who was part of the negotiating committee which made an agreement with the Basque provinces.
During the Spanish Civil War, Amado Reygondaud chaired the Finance Committee of the Technical Board of the State under Francisco Franco and would continue later in his first government, formed on February 1, 1938. He was, in fact, the only survivor of the Technical Board to retain his position or survive the Civil War. Amado worked with Ramón Serrano Súñer in drafting the decree that established the new administrative state in February 1938. However, Amado and Serrano Suñer grew increasingly discontented with Franco's government and showed a clear dislike of the dictator. Serrano claimed the services at the Technical Board of the State were not regarded highly enough and that they were considered "people without merit".

Instax

Instax is a brand of instant still cameras and films marketed by Fujifilm since the late 1990s. There are two formats of Instax film and cameras − the original "wide" format which gives an image approximately 60mm x 99mm, and a "mini" format of 62mm x 46mm.
The films and cameras are based upon the improvements Kodak made to Polaroid's SX-70 instant film system in the instant film cameras it sold in the 1970s and 1980s, namely the ability to expose the film through the rear of the photograph, and the reversal of the order of the dye layers so that development in the blue layer is visible first. As a result of these changes the image does not need to be taken via a reflex mirror in order to reverse the image (as all Polaroid integral film cameras do); and colour balance and tonal range are improved over Polaroid integral instant films. As well Fuji's decision to integrate the pressure plate springs and electrical power sources into the camera bodies rather than the disposable film pack itself helps make the Instax system more economical per exposure than Polaroid's equivalents.
Although Kodak itself ceased production of instant film cameras when it was successfully sued by Polaroid for patent violation, the Instax cameras were made and marketed with Polaroid's permission and as a result could not be officially distributed in certain territories such as the USA, until the original Polaroid patents expired in the mid 1990s. With Polaroid ceasing production of instant films in 2008, the Instax system was the only integral instant film system in production until The Impossible Project launched their own integral film in early 2010. The Instax Mini system is now also marketed by the rights owner of Polaroid as Polaroid 300.

John Wilson (playwright)

John Wilson (1626–1696) was an English playwright and lawyer.
Life and Work.
He was son of Aaron Wilson, a royalist divine, and was born in London in 1627. He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, in 1644, and entered Lincoln's Inn two years later, being called to the bar in 1649. His unswerving support of the royal pretensions recommended him to James, duke of York, through whose influence he became Recorder of Derry about 1681. "His Discourse of Monarchy" (1684), a tract in favour of the succession of the duke of York, was followed (1685) by a "Pindarique" on his coronation. In 1688 he wrote "Jus regium Coronae", a learned defence of James's action in dispensing with the penal statutes. He died in obscurity, due perhaps to his political opinions, in 1696. Wilson was the author of four plays, showing a vigorous and learned wit, and a power of character-drawing that place him rather among the followers of Ben Jonson than with the Restoration dramatists.
"The Cheats" (written in 1662, printed 1664, 1671) was played with great success in 1663. John Lacy found one of his best parts in Scruple, a caricature of a Presbyterian minister of accommodating morality. "Andronicus Comnenius" (1664), a blank verse tragedy, is based on the story of Andronicus Comnenus as told by Peter Heylin in his "Cosmography". It contains a scene between the usurper and the widow of his victim Alexius which follows very closely Shakespeare's treatment of a parallel situation in Richard III. "The Projectors" (1665), a prose comedy of London life, is, like Molière's "The Miser", founded on the Aulularia of Plautus, but there is no evidence that Wilson was acquainted with the French play. "Belphegor, or the Marriage of the Devil; a Tragi-coniedy" (1690), treats of a theme familiar to Elizabethan drama, but Wilson took the subject from the Belphegor attributed to Machiavelli, and alludes also to Straparola's version in the "Notti". He also translated into English Erasmus's "Encomium Moriae" (1668).

He was born in Lucena, in what is now the Province of Córdoba. A cultured and educated man, he held different positions of high importance for the Court, acting as Viceroy of Catalonia from 1642 to 1644, as Ambassador in Rome (1664–1666), and Viceroy of Naples (1666–1671), as well as Commander in chief of Catalonia.
He succeeded in 1670 to the joint titles of 7th Duke of Segorbe, and 8th Duke of Cardona, because of the death of his nephew known usually as Luis Raimundo Folch de Cardona. 
He was brought before the Justice Courts by two females from the family and their husbands, but he died in Madrid before the case was solved, creating some problems afterwards with the numbering of the titles of both Dukedoms since then as apparently he had been too quick claiming "legal", self-appointed, succession to both Dukedoms. 
During his period of ten years in Italy (1662–1672), he amassed a personal library of great value. Being one of the protectors and patrons of Poblet Monastery, he donated his library of approximately 3600 volumes in 1677 in exchange for being able to be buried amongst its venerated figures after his death. He sent back to Naples, from the Poblet Monastery, in 1671, the body of king Alfonso V of Aragon.
He published a book on "Geometria Militar" in 1671.

Exempt charity

An exempt charity is an institution established in England and Wales for charitable purposes which is exempt from registration with, and oversight by, the Charity Commission. 
Exempt charities are largely institutions of further and higher education, universities, student unions, industrial and provident societies, friendly societies, or national museums, that were established by Act of Parliament or by Royal Charter. These organisations are specified in Schedule 2 to the Charities Act 1993.
Historically, they were treated as exempt from supervision because they were considered to be adequately supervised by, or accountable to, some other body or authority, such as Parliament. 
Although outside the jurisdiction of the Charity Commission, they are still subject to the usual legal rules applicable to charities in English law and to the general provisions of the Charities Acts.
The Charities Act 2006 substantially changed the law on exempt charities, introducing the requirement of a "principal regulator" to oversee the compliance of the charity with charity law. The 1993 and 2006 Acts were superseded by the Charities Act 2011, which consolidates previous charity law in the UK.
Named charities.
The following institutions are specifically listed by name as exempt charities by the 1993 Act:

The band, Raymond Matthews (born October 13, 1956), Woody Wright (born October 10, 1957) and Tony King (born June 27, 1957), was put together by Columbia Records producer Larry Strickland after Shenandoah left the label, as an attempt to keep a viable country band on that label. Wright had previously been in another band called Memphis.
Though they enjoyed video success on CMT and TNN as well as touring with Reba McEntire for two seasons, their highest charting radio single, "The Power of Love," peaked at No. 41 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 1992. It was the title track of their debut album, issued that same year on Columbia Records. The trio dissolved shortly after the release of their second album, "Dream Seekers". 
Since disbanding, Tony King joined Brooks & Dunn's backing band and was also briefly engaged to Wynonna Judd, Woody Wright found success as a gospel songwriter, producer and solo artist, while Raymond Matthews returned to his native Alabama and a successful contracting business.

1912–13 South Africa rugby union tour

The 1912–13 South Africa rugby union tour was a collection of friendly rugby union games undertaken by the South Africa national rugby union team against England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and France. The tour also took in several matches against British and Irish club, county and invitational teams. This was the second South African tour of the Northern Hemisphere, after the very successful 1906 tour.
Although not managing to win all the matches on the tour, the Springboks managed to win all five test matches against international opposition. Billy Millar was the tour captain even though he was the last person chosen for the tour and was not the selectors' choice of captain, but they were overruled by the South African Rugby Board. Millar did have the advantage of being one of the few players to have toured Britain in the previous test, but was seen by the hosts as a fiery character and was not as popular with the players or fans as the 1906's tour captain, Paul Roos. The other two members of the squad to have played in the 1906 tour were vice-captain Fred 'Uncle' Dobbin and Doug Morkel.
In the touring party were two sets of brothers; Richard, Freddie and John Luyt and Gerhard and Jack Morkel.

Diego Arias de Miranda

Diego Arias de Miranda (December 1, 1845 – June 28, 1929) was a Spanish politician linked to Christian naturalism. He was minister of justice and navy during the reign of King Alfonso XIII.
A member of the Liberal Party, his political career began with the 1872 election, which resulted in his election in the district of Burgos, even though the proclamation of the First Spanish Republic resulted in a parenthesis in his political activity, and he did not return as a representative until 1886. Since then, he got reelected in every political process until 1903, and in 1904 he passed to the Senate as senator for life. 
He was minister of the Navy from February 9, 1910 to April 3, 1911 in the Canalejas cabinet, and minister of Justice from March 12 and December 31, 1912, in successive governments, presided by Canalejas until his assassination, then García Prieto, and finally the Count of Romanones.
He was a civilian governor, general manager of public works and mayor of Aranda de Duero. In the center of Aranda de Duero, he commissioned a square named in his honor, treating himself with a plaza in whose center he commissioned a statue of himself. His daughter, Josefina Arias de Miranda, married José Martínez de Velasco (1875–1936), founder and leader of the Spanish Agrarian Party, minister of several departments during the Second Republic and mayor of Madrid for 12 years. The son-in-law of Don Diego Arias de Miranda was executed at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.

The IITP Code of Conduct is mostly concerned with non-discrimination, zeal, community, skills, competence, continuous development, consequences, and conflicts of interest., and contains the following 8 tenets:
Membership.
The IITP has an estimated membership of approximately 2,500 individual members, plus around 100 Corporate Partners (businesses who have joined on behalf of their staff) resulting in an estimated representation of over 10,000 ICT professionals.
IITP provides for multiple membership levels depending on a member's stage of career and requirements.
Professional Membership.
Professional membership is for those in the ICT profession who meet certain requirements in terms of experience and qualifications. 
Structure.
The Institute of IT Professionals is a single nationwide non-profit incorporated society.
Within the Institute are five branches based on geographic location, being Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury, Waikato/Bay of Plenty, and Otago/Southland. The IITP also encompasses a number of Specialist Groups in topics such as Software Testing and Computer Security. IITP branches and specialist groups are staffed by volunteers.
The Institute is governed by a National Council made up of the IITP President, Deputy President, and five Councillors, with each councillor being appointed by one of the branches of the Institute.
The Institute maintains a fully staffed operational head office in Wellington and is managed by a Chief Executive who also sits on Council in a non-voting capacity.
Advocacy.
IITP is regarded as the voice of the ICT profession in New Zealand and undertakes significant advocacy on behalf of the profession and wider sector.
IITP is represented on most ICT-related advisory groups, panels and public ICT-related boards in New Zealand, and was a founding member of the Digital Development Council, a body set up by the New Zealand Government to help achieve New Zealand's digital potential.
The Institute is engaged with government (both ministerial and official level), industry and academia and works as a catalyst and conduit for these three important sub-sectors to work together in the interests of the overall ICT Sector, both in the area of ethics and professional practice as well as to solve issues such as the current ICT skills shortage and drop in tertiary ICT enrolments.
IITP also takes an active interest in educational issues and in 2008 completed a detailed analysis of ICT-related NCEA "Achievement Standards" in secondary schools and outlined a number of significant and serious problems with these standards.
The Institute also promotes digital literacy.

EVS Broadcast Equipment

EVS Broadcast Equipment SA manufactures live outside broadcast digital video production systems.
Its recorders have become the dominant standard for broadcasters worldwide. Their XT3 production video servers enable the creation, editing, exchange and playout of audio and video feeds.
The company states that over 5,000 operators of all nationalities now use their applications on a daily basis.
EVS has achieved success in compressed video and audio data processing, and is endeavouring to maintain its market position in the migration from analogue to digital in television networks.
Tapeless television production.
The programming of the television networks consists primarily of broadcasting prerecorded images which, until very recently, were stored on tapes. But "linear editing" (or editing on tape) is being replaced by digital media or "non-linear editing". Today, digital technology on hard disk (non-linear, by definition) is the common alternative. There has been clear confirmation of a migration towards this technology for some years, even though it will still take another 5 to 6 years or so for the hard disk penetration rate to increase from 30% to 70%. Television stations began migrating to tapeless interoperable computer platforms beginning in the late 1990s. Video recorders are rarely used nowadays for live productions. EVS type digital media servers are the norm in live broadcasting.
Company history.
EVS was co-founded in 1994 by Pierre Lhoest and Laurent Minguet. Three years later, the company invested 30% of its capital in private funds, roundabout EUR 4 million.
In 1998, EVS was listed for the first time on the stock exchange with an initial EUR 14.8 quotation per share (at comparable levels) and was valued at EUR 204 million. In that same year, EVS acquired VSE, a hardware subcontractor managed by Michel Counson. In that transaction, VSE received EVS shares for an approximate EUR 4.5 million value.
Since then, EVS has become a major broadcast actor focusing on digital recording technologies for live sport TV production. EVS core products are primarily used in outbroadcasting vans (OB vans) and allow high-quality respectively slow-motion image replay. EVS has revolutionised the professional digital recording by being the first to introduce a hard disk drive in that field, instead of the traditional magnetic tape recording, a business led at that time by Sony and Panasonic.
After establishing itself in outbroadcasting sport production, EVS started using their high value servers to address TV studio production with a full range of products from 2002. That strategic move contributed to a +40% uplift in 2012. Additionally, EVS founded XDC in 2004, a pioneer in high definition cinema broadcasting. Following various acquisitions, XDC was restructured within the Dcinex Group.
In 2001, Laurent Minguet stepped down from his position as a director within the sports division to focus on the digital cinema business. In 2007, he started building his own IMG company, a player in real estates and renewable energies. Three years later, he gave up his position as an EVS director.
From his side, Pierre L’Hoest decided to leave his role as a CEO and director following the board of directors meeting held on September 15 of 2011. In a transitional period, EVS was managed by its board of directors.
In 2012, EVS appoints Joop JANSSEN as CEO.
Awards.
The company and its products have received various international awards:
Offices.
EVS headquarters (administration, production and development) are located in Liège in Belgium.
4 additional development centers are found in: 
EVS has also sales and support offices in: London, Montreal, Los Angeles, New York, Dubai, Mexico, Paris, Munich, Madrid, Brescia, Beijing, Hong Kong, Sydney and Mumbai.

Nowsher Ali Khan Yusufzai (1864–1924) was a Bengali writer and philanthropist.
Nowsher Ali Khan Yusufzai was born in the village of Charan in Tangail. He passed the Entrance examination in 1881 from Pogose School in Dhaka and FA in 1887 from Dhaka College. He studied for the BA examination but unsuccessfully. Nevertheless, it can be said that he was the first Muslim to qualify for FA in Tangail district. While studying for his BA he married Rahimunnesa, a daughter of the zamindar of Pakulla. He was appointed to the post of Sub-Registrar of Pakulla in 1889 and was upgraded to Sub-Deputy Registrar in 1891. He was the first Muslim in this post in Tangail. He retired from his job in 1919.
Nowsher Ali was associated with different social and educational institutions of his locality and of Calcutta. He was also a good speaker. Development of the backward Muslim society was the central point of his thinking. He wrote books in prose and verse. Some of his works worth mentioning are Bangiya Mussalman (1891), Shaishab Kusum (Poem, 1895), Dalil Registrari Shiksa (1897), Uchcha Bangala Shiksabidhi (1901), Notes on Mohammedan Education in Bengal (1903), Mussalman Jatiya Sangit (1909), Sahitya Pratibha (1914), Sahitya Shiksa (1915). Bangiya Mussalman and Notes on Mohammedan Education in Bengal reflect his social consciousness, national feeling, humanity, educational interests, economic and political sense, and earned his a place in society.

Henry Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret

Henry Frederick Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret PC (1735–1826) was a British politician, known as the Honourable Henry Thynne until 1776.
Biography.
He was the second son of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth, and his second wife Louisa, daughter of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville. He was thus the younger brother of Thomas Thynne, 3rd Viscount Weymouth, later Marquess of Bath.
He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA, and in 1753 proceeded MA. In 1769 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Laws.
In 1757, he was encouraged by his friend Lord Gower to enter Parliament for Staffordshire, when that seat became vacant on the death of Gower's uncle, Hon. William Leveson-Gower. In 1761, he was elected for the Herefordshire borough of Weobley, which he represented until 1770.
In 1762, his brother sought an office for him, leading to his appointment as Clerk Comptroller of the Green Cloth (worth £1000 per year). He lost this office when the Grenville government fell in 1765, entering into opposition. After his brother returned to office as Secretary of State in 1767, Thynne was able to return to the Board of Green Cloth in 1768 as Master of the Household, a post worth over £900 that he held until 1771.
He was made a member of the Privy Council in 1770. In 1771 (after his brother had left office, he was given the office of joint Postmaster General, which he held until 1789. This was worth £3000 per year, and he thereupon retired from the House of Commons.
In 1776, he changed his name to Carteret, when he succeeded to Hawnes Park, Bedfordshire on the death of his uncle Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville. He also succeeded him as Bailiff of Jersey, a post (for life) long held by heads of the Carteret family. He was created Baron Carteret, of Hawnes, in 1784, reviving his uncle's second title. He gave up the postmastership in 1789, when his brother became Marquess of Bath.
In 1810, he married his mistress of many years, Eleanor Smart, but there were no children. He lived until 1826, being succeeded as baron by his nephew Lord George Thynne in accordance with a special remainder in the patent when he was created baron.

Sofitel New York Hotel

Sofitel New York is a boutique hotel on West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, owned and managed by the Sofitel corporation. It lies about north of Bryant Park and New York Public Library and next to the New York Yacht Club. The hotel is inspired by French traditions in furnishings and theme, and the hotel staff are bilingual in French and English. Completed in 2000, the , 30-floor, 398-guest room limestone and glass building was awarded the 2000 Emporis Skyscraper Award.
History.
Construction on the hotel began in 1997, and it opened in the year 2000. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was reportedly responsible for funding the project after a design by Brennan Beer Gorman was chosen in an architectural competition which included entries from architects such as Michael Graves & Associates. After construction the building was awarded the 2000 Emporis Skyscraper Award.
Strauss-Khan rape allegation.
On May 14, 2011, a 32-year-old housekeeper at the hotel, an immigrant from Guinea, alleged that IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn attempted to rape her in his hotel room. She had walked into his room as he was having a shower although he had not yet checked out.
Architecture.
Described as "one of midtown's new, glitzy "boutique" hotels," and claiming to offer a "mélange harmonieux du style français et de l'esprit" it is tall with 30 floors and has 398 luxury guest rooms including 52 suites. The architectural design by Brennan Beer Gorman features limestone and glass, with a T-shaped base. The facade was architecturally inspired by Parisian Moderne limestone buildings and according to Frommer's "Guide" exudes "old-world French elegance" far beyond its years of existence as a hotel. The facade is bronze with 3 flying geese above in a large portal.
Ground floor.
The French theme is very strong in the hotel, from the greeting of "Bonjour" or "Bonsoir" in reception to the French restaurant "Gaby" which serves croissants for breakfast and the gift shop selling French perfumery and cosmetics. "Gaby" is Art Deco inspired and is overlooked by head chef Sylvain Harribey. "The New York Times" describes the hotel as "beautifully run", "with a front desk at the far end of a ballroom-sized lobby, tucked away to the side, which gives the entrance a serene quality." The hotel staff are bilingual in both French and English.
In the center of the lobby there is "a 2-story rotunda with a curving staircase, a tall wooden sculpture, and a mural of Central Park." The hotel contains a Grand Ballroom with 2.5-story windows and 8 meeting rooms with a capacity of 10 to 60 people.
Rooms.
Frommer's describes the hotel rooms as follows: "The rooms are spacious and ultra-comfortable, adorned with art from New York and Paris. The lighting is soft and romantic, the walls and windows soundproof. Suites are extra-special, equipped with king beds, two televisions, and pocket doors separating the bedroom from a sitting room. Bathrooms in all rooms are magnificent, with separate showers and soaking tubs." The beds are said to be signature feather “Sobeds” which "offer the ultimate in comfort". The majority of the beds are cream or white or white with maroon trimmings and feature large paintings above the headboards. The bathrooms have Roger & Gallet bath amenities.

Young Griffo

Albert Griffiths (1 January 1871 in Millers Point, Sydney, Australia — 10 December 1927), better known as Young Griffo, was a world featherweight boxing champion.
Professional career.
Griffo turned pro in 1886 and fought primarily in his home land of Australia. He held the Australian featherweight title for many years, and in 1890 challenged Torpedo Billy Murphy for the World Featherweight Title and won in the 15th round after Murphy retired. He defended the title four times before vacating it to fight at a higher weight. His last bout was in 1904.
In a tribute to Griffo, Tommy Sullivan wrote in the 6 March 1916 " Tacoma Daily News": 
Not known as much of a puncher, but his skill was uncanny. He had wonderful headwork, almost inpenetrable defense, dazzling feints, and rapid two-handed methods of attack. The cleverest boxers and hardest punchers were made to look ridiculous when exchanging swats with him. He had a dislike of training and was deemed lazy. There were times he got drunk before a match as the Ike Weir and Tommy Tracy bouts.
Honors.
In 2003, Griffo was inducted into the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame.
Film.
He appeared as himself in the 1895 lost short "Young Griffo vs. Battling Charles Barnett", which at least one source claims is the first film shown for profit.

Better the Devil You Know (album)

Better the Devil You Know is the third album by British pop star Sonia.
Released in May 1993, the album followed Sonia's appearance in the Eurovision Song Contest. The previous year, Sonia had been selected to be the UK representative and she performed all eight songs in the Song for Europe. The 1992 participant Michael Ball had enjoyed great success with his album based on the contest when it reached No.1 in the charts, and Sonia's management were keen to see similar results. "Better the Devil You Know" featured four songs from the contest (the top four placed songs: "A Little Love", "Our World", "So Much of Your Love" and the winner "Better the Devil You Know"). However, the album failed to replicate Ball's success and peaked at No.32 in the charts. The title track however finished a close second in the Contest and reached No.15 on the UK charts.
An earlier single, a cover of the disco hit "Boogie Nights" was also included on the album, while a planned follow-up to the Eurovision song, "Rescue Me" (also a cover) went unreleased. This album marked the end of Sonia's hit-making period, which had lasted since 1989. From this point, Sonia concentrated on TV and stage work, while two more singles and a final album failed to find success.
