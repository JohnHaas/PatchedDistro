Selected Quotes from Critic and Press.
"Influenced by pop culture and social media platforms, Xi Zhang mines material for his art from what he refers to as “twenty-first century DNA”—Facebook, video games, advertisements, and Google searches. He combines an eye-popping palette with traditional oil painting techniques to examine how modern identities and relationships become disjointed in our frenetic, digital world. Zhang’s creations comment on the mind-altering effects of contemporary society’s addiction to technology, echoing the psychedelic art of the 1960s." Denver Art Museum
“Xi’s is a perfect example of an artist who comes from abroad, makes Denver his home and creates new work that really captures that duality of cultures,” Tariana Navas-Nieves, Manager for Cultural Programs at Arts and Venues Denver, KUNC July 18, 2013
"Talk about potential. Xi Zhang  is brimming with it. His solo exhibition, which concludes its  all-too-short run Saturday at  the  Rule Gallery,  would be a notable accomplishment for a veteran artist. But considering that  Zhang  is 23 and just graduated last month from  the  Rocky  Mountain College of Art  + Design  with a bachelor of  fine arts  degree,it's   nothing  short  of   astonishing...This  young  Chinese   artist already possesses an integrated, well-developed and surprisingly mature artistic vision,  which plays  itself out with impressive creativity...Make no mistake. In the exploding Chinese art  scene,Zhang  has everything it takes  to become a major  player." Kyle MacMillan, "Emerging artist  Xi Zhang delves into notion of identity in masses," Denver  Post, May 2, 2008
"Classical  and contemporary. Eastern  philosophy and Western sensibilities. Pixelations and paint. These elements collide in  fascinating, often unexpected ways  in  the smart,  quickly evolving paintings of  26-year-old Xi Zhang,  who  is finishing a master  of  fine arts degree at the University of Colorado a to Boulder...It might seem logical for an artist  so obviously in tune  with  technology to  render  this updated imagery using  a digital medium. but  Zhang likes the  subtlety and  link to  the  past  that  painting provides.He grew  up  looking to the  West  for artistic inspiration (his father was a big fan of abstract expressionism). and  it was only  after he was in this country for a few years that he really  began to  pay attention to traditional  Chinese    painting...Here   and    elsewhere in   his  work,   he   offers   fresh, of-the-moment takes  on  those enduring,  inescapable questions: What   is old and what   is new?  What is  reality and what   is  illusion? " Kyle MacMillan, "Pathmakers  2011: Xi  Zhang  -  Working with tradition, but  adding 21st century twists," The Denver  Post, January 2, 2011
"The scope  of Xi Zhang's work is as expansive as his native China. Although, like his home  here in America, it moves  within a boiling cauldron of pop  culture mixed with  soul  that is,at once, frantic, effortlessly organic and as glossy as an Apple commercial. The effulgence emanating from his mind  into  his fingertips through the  quick-drying acrylic on his canvases makes  us question what it means to be human, to be alive, in this incredible time we find ourselves." Elliot  Riis, "Psychadelic Prospector- Zhang!"- 303  MAGAZINE,  March 2012
"Xi's painted worlds feel hallucinogenic, mysterious and deeply psychological. Xi illustrates his observations on  interpersonal communication. modern technology and  the intimacies of  his childhood in China  with a tremendous amount of  exuberance and intrigue. From  the  basic academic viewpoint. Xi's individual style  breaks  all the  rules:  figures  crash through barriers to float wildly, erotic and esoteric subjects coexist with the  banal haphazardly,geometric  overlays   and  bold  mash-ups of  color  on  frequently metallic-foiled grounds electrify his  surface   treatments. The  overall   effect is  essentially a  cacophony of visual  stimuli-Kirkland meets  Kierkegaard meets  Kerouac-much like the world we all live in today,  and  the  world Xi passionately interprets. It's safe to  say Xi  Zhang,  with the  undying support and enthusiasm of lvar Zeile at  Plus Gallery, has cemented his position among the Nation's leading contemporary  painters in an astonishingly short  amount of time...He is certainly promoting the dawn  of a new age for China as well as contemporary art on a global scale,  but   he  isn't  just  a  cog  in  the  Chinese  Contemporary Art   market to  himself   or  his supporters at Plus Gallery. He's a great  painter.  who  happens to be Chinese.who  has already enriched the  cultural  landscape of  Denver,  and   deserves   our  attention and  support  for yawning at  the  boredom of convention with simple materials like  paint.  paper and canvas. Let's  hope  curators here and  abroad agree. and collect his work  for  all the  right reasons  for many  decades to come." Christopher Fox, lOQ:  Xi Zhang,"  The Denver Dart, March 3, 2012
"The paintings in 11 Ceremonies have an ambitious quality from several perspective Ves. Including technique, subject matter and,most important. a kind  of  visual charisma.  This final characteristic  makes Zhang's works  seem more monumental than they actually are - though they are pretty  large. According  to the artist's written  statement the paintings have to do  with Zhang's interest in social media, but this is hard to see. That's because they are so apparently hand-wrought, and thus seem to be worlds away from the computer and the Internet. so while social media may  be a source, it's possible to ignore this aspect and to focus instead on Zhang's accomplished sense for composition and his striking expertise in putting paint to canvas...Among the many strengths of Zhang's paintings are their elaborately intriguing  surfaces and their strong and widely varied palettes, which differ from canvas to canvas...Zhang·s taste for bold palettes is clear evidence of his origins in Chinese aesthetics. but  he also channels the recent art  history  of figuration in America and Europe.making the resulting works extremely sophisticated on  several levels."Xi Zhang  and  Out  Figured shows provide strong counter-currents to abstraction.." Michael Paglia West word,April 3.2012
"A blend of cultures-Zhang was born in China and moved  to the United States with his family  when he was 19-Zhang has long been interested in dualities: virtual versus real,East  versus West, old  versus new. His trippy paintings  merge  lifelike drawings  of real people  with abstract shapes and colors. And  in exploring a very modern concept-social media-Zhang intentionally uses paint, one of art's oldest mediums." Daliah Singer ·Outside The Lines- The Modernist Xi Zhang; 5280,September 2012
"Xi Zhang -- a traveler to the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design,all the way from Kaifeng, China  •• brought with  him  an almost  uncanny.  fully  formed spirit of contemporary Chinese painting.  This small,tight,color-splashed show at Plus Gallery sealed the deal, reminding us  that  we  had  a  skilled genius in our midst."Susan Froyd  Twelve  Denver  arts flashbacks from 2012, Westword,Dec. 28 2012
"Plus Gallery artist Xi Zhang is off  to Buenos Aires next week for the month long artists residency program URRA.  Zhang's journey to Argentina's one of the first programs supported by Platform  5280 Denver Biennial of the Americas. a major  honor as Xi gets to represent Denver's thriving artistic  community abroad and interact with over 13 artists from around  the world. Zhang is also  the  only  US based artist to be selected for the URRA program this year. so he will also be representing the  country  that recently approved his citizenship." lvar Zeile Plus Gallery Blog,October 2012

Hasratein ("Desires") is an Indian television soap opera that was telecast on Zee TV in the mid 1990s. It is the story of Savi, a woman who leaves her husband and maintains an extra-marital relationship with another married man, with both their spouses being aware of the situation. "Hasratein" was one of the most popular television shows of the 1990s. According to Shubhra Gupta, film and television critic, the popularity of the serial "had made it a catalyst for the discussion of issues of marital discord, in spite of the embarrassment the serial generated for many people."

HMS Vortigern (D37)

HMS "Vortigern" was a V Class destroyer of the Royal Navy. She served in both World Wars, and was sunk in 1942.
Construction and commissioning.
"Vortigern" was ordered from J. Samuel White, of Cowes, Isle of Wight during the First World War under the 1916-17 Programme Build (9th Order), and was laid down on 17 January 1917. She was launched on 5 October 1917 and commissioned on 21 January 1918. She has been the only ship of the Royal Navy so far to be named HMS "Vortigern", after Vortigern, an early British ruler.
Wartime and interwar service.
"Vortigern" served throughout the remaining months of the war, and was redeployed to the Baltic Sea in 1919, later serving with the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. She was eventually placed in reserve, but was reactivated in 1939 in order to take part in the August Fleet Review of the ships of the reserve by HM King George VI.
Second World War.
With the outbreak of war "Vortigern" was deployed with the 17th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Plymouth and tasked with escorting convoys and carrying out anti-submarine patrols in the South Western Approaches and the English Channel. She was engaged in these duties for the rest of 1939. In January 1940 "Vortigern" was nominated to join the 13th Destroyer Flotilla based at Gibraltar. On 13 January, she and HMS "Velox" escorted the outbound convoy OG-14F to Gibraltar. On their arrival on 15 January, both destroyers were detached to join the flotilla. "Vortigern" spent the period between February and June escorting convoys between Britain and Gibraltar.
On 3 July she was present at the attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir (Operation Catapult). On 6 July she formed part of the escort with the ships of the 13th and 8th Destroyer Flotillas for the battlecruiser , the battleship , the aircraft carrier HMS "Ark Royal" and the cruisers HMS "Arethusa" and HMS "Enterprise" for the air attacks on the French battleship "Dunkerque". "Vortigern" then joined the destroyers HMS "Faulknor", "Foxhound", "Fearless", HMS "Forester", "Escort", "Douglas" "Active", "Velox" and "Wrestler" on 8 July as they screened the capital ships preparing for air attacks from HMS "Ark Royal" on Italian targets on Cagliari. The operation was abandoned after the force came under heavy air attacks, and "Vortigern" took passage to Britain on 12 July.
She deployed in August on convoy defence duties in Home waters, covering convoys sailing in the North Western Approaches to and from the Clyde. She was taken in hand in September for a refit, and to be converted into a Short Range Escort. The work lasted until November, and after completing trials "Vortigern" joined the 12th Destroyer Flotilla based at Rosyth, and deployed to escort convoys in the North Sea. On 9 December whilst escorting one convoy, "Vortigern" came under attack by a German seaplane off Aldeburgh. She continued patrols and convoy escort duties all throughout 1941 and into 1942.
Sinking.
"Vortigern" was sunk off Cromer on 15 March, whilst defending a coastal convoy against attack by E-boats. She was torpedoed by the E-boat "S104", and sank with the loss of 110 lives. Only 14 survivors were rescued. Eleven bodies were recovered from the sea by the Cromer lifeboat "H F Bailey" III. The wrecksite is designated as a "Protected Place" under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

Movement of Priests for the Third World

The Movement of Priests for the Third World (Spanish: "Movimiento de Sacerdotes para el Tercer Mundo", MSTM) was a tendency among the Catholic Church in Argentina which aimed at combining reform ideas which followed the Second Vatican Council with a strong political and social participation. Formed mainly by priests active in "villas miserias" (shantytowns) and workers' neighborhoods, the Movement of Priests for the Third World was an important canal for social action between 1967 and 1976, close to Leftwing Peronism and, at times, Marxism. It was also close to the "CGT de los Argentinos", which was strongly active in the 1969 Cordobazo demonstrations against Juan Carlos Onganía's military dictatorship.
Creation.
The CELAM declaration of Medellín (August 1968) tied poverty in the Third World to exploitation by multinational firms of industrialized countries, supporting liberation theology. The Medellín declaration was issued at a time when the Argentine Catholic Church was already in turmoil. Three priests from Buenos Aires, Héctor Botán, Miguel Ramondetti and Rodolfo Ricciardelli had published, a month earlier, the "Manifiesto de los 18 Obispos" (Manifest of the 18 Bishops), which proposed, among other suggestions, the creation of the MSTM. The first encounter took place in May 1968, with the tacit authorization of the bishops Guillermo Bolatti, Enrique Angelelli, Alberto Devoto, Jerónimo Podestá, Jaime de Nevares, Adolfo Tortolo and Vicente Faustino Zazpe, although none of them would associate themselves with the Movement of Priests for the Third World.
Along with laics, the MSTM dedicated itself to social welfare projects, as well as supporting workers' claims, at a time when the military dictatorship of Onganía had suspended the right to strike as well as other political rights. The MSTM's relationship with trade unions lead many of its members to gravitate towards Peronism, and even Socialism. 
In December 1969, more than 20 priests, members of the MSTM, marched on the "Casa Rosada" to present to Onganía a petition pleading him to abandon the eradication plan of "villas miserias".
The same year, the Movement issued a declaration supporting Socialist revolutionary movements, which led to the Catholic hierarchy, through Juan Carlos Aramburu, coadjutor Archbishop of Buenos Aires, to proscribe priests from making political or social declarations.
One of the MSTM statements advocated socialization of the means of production (i.e. abolition of private ownership of the means of production), leading to its condemnation by the Catholic hierarchy.
Internal conflicts and dissolving.
Various political conflicts inside the MTSM, with some advocating a more centralist version of Peronism, others a more horizontal organisation, and yet others supporting Guevarism rather than Peronism, led to a rupture in the movement in its 1973 encounter. Although the priests did not cease individual actions, the MSTM ceased to function as a united front.
Along with the increase in repression during the Dirty War, the movement lost any capacity for action and finally dissolved itself a few years after Juan Perón's death. Although a few of its members left the clergy, in general to marry, the majority remained priests. A 1988 study estimated that 67% of its members had kept their clerical status.

Trade Winds (1938 film)

Trade Winds is a 1938 comedy film distributed by United Artists. It was directed by Tay Garnett, and starred Fredric March and Joan Bennett. The screenplay was written by Dorothy Parker, Alan Campbell and Frank R. Adams, based on story by Tay Garnett.
Plot.
The night that San Francisco socialite Kay Kerrigan has to identify the body of her younger sister in the morgue, she confronts millionaire playboy Thomas Bruhme II in his apartment. Kay blames her sister's suicide on the callous Bruhme, who hands her his gun and blithely tells her to shoot. Enraged and humiliated, Kay shoots at Bruhme's stomach and he falls dead. After Kay hastily leaves, police detective Ben "Homer" Blodgett sees Bruhme's body with a fatal bullet in the back of his head and, finding Kay's handbag, deduces that she is the murderer. When an all-points bulletin is issued for her arrest, Kay drives her car into the bay, making the police believe that she is also a suicide victim. Some time later, in Hawaii, Kay pawns a unique piece of her jewelry, and Police Commissioner Blackton knows that she did not die. Not trusting the bumbling Homer's capacity to track Kay down, the commissioner contacts former policeman Sam Wye, a brilliant detective who specializes in finding, and romancing, women. Sam leaves his creditors and his fuming secretary Jean Livingstone behind and heads for Hawaii, accompanied by Homer. After charming some hairdressers, Sam discovers that Jean changed from blonde to brunette and sailed for Japan. Homer and Sam then search for Kay throughout the Orient. While Homer looks at tobacco shops asking if a woman has purchased Kay's special brand of Egyptian cigarettes, Sam goes to cafes trying to see if a woman has been playing Frédéric Chopin's "Andantino in A Flat Major," Kay's favorite melody, on the piano. When Homer thinks he has found the woman, it turns out to be Jean, who followed Sam to rekindle their old romance and collect a $100,000 reward now being offered by Bruhme's father. Jean also has a photo of Kay and the tip that she is travelling on a British passport as "Mary Holden." On a boat sailing toward Saigon, Sam finally meets Kay, and immediately falls in love with her. He doesn't let her know that he is a detective, and she falls in love with him as well. Now jealous as well as miffed over Sam's attempts to keep her from collecting part of the reward, Jean poses as a missionary's daughter and becomes friendly with Kay herself. She also helps Kay when she thinks that Sam secretly wired for the reward. Travelling from port to port, Jean, who is now very fond of Kay, helps her get away, then when Sam finds them again, she goes with them on a slow boat back to San Francisco after Kay decides that she no longer wants to be a fugitive. In order to help Kay avoid capture from rival police detective George Faulkner, Sam makes Faulkner believe that Jean is Kay, long enough for him to take Kay to a distant island. When Faulkner does track them down, Sam intends to shoot him, but Faulkner wounds him instead and Sam suddenly says that he has captured Kay for the reward. Back in San Francisco, the press calls Sam a "heel" for turning in his sweetheart, and even Homer and Jean, who have fallen in love with each other, think that Sam is a cad. After collecting the reward, Sam buys Bruhme's apartment and invites all of Bruhme's old girl friends to a party. During the party, he reveals to Homer that he has discovered that Kay's gun actually had blanks in it and thinks that Bruhme was killed from behind by a jealous lover. By rigging up a phony radio broadcast, Sam makes the real killer, Mr. Johnson, think that Kay has been found guilty of murder, and coerces him into confessing that he killed Bruhme for having an affair with Mrs. Johnson. Now free from the murder charge, Kay marries Sam, who finally has shaken his image as a cad.
Release.
The film earned a profit of $71,129.

The Alliance for Women in Media, originally the American Women in Radio and Television (AWRT), is a national non-profit organization for female professionals in radio, television, and other electronic media.
Founded in 1951, AWRT currently has several chapters across the United States and has its headquarters McLean, Virginia. Since its founding, AWRT has worked to improve the quality of broadcast programming and the image of women as depicted in radio, television and cable. AWRT's mission is to advance the impact of women in the electronic media and associated industries by educating, advocating and acting as a resource to its members. The organization adopted its present name in 2010.
History.
AWRT was formed in 1951 when the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) discontinued its women's division, the Association of Women Directors (AWD). The NAB Board approved the development of a new organization and offered complete cooperation and assistance until the new organization could work out the details of separate operation. The following year, more than 280 women gathered to approve the structure of the new organization.
In 1960, AWRT established The Foundation of AWRT. The Foundation of AWRT supports educational programs, charitable activities, public service campaigns and scholarships to benefit the public, the electronic media and communication and associated industries.
The Foundation of AWRT annually hosts the Gracie Awards in New York City. Inspired by radio and television star Gracie Allen, the Gracie Awards honor programming made for women, by women, and about women.
In 2010, AWRT announced their name change to the Alliance for Women in Media. Sylvia Strobel, 2010 Chair of the National Board of Directors of American Women in Radio and Television (AWRT) and the Foundation of AWRT, announced at the organization’s Annual Business Meeting on March 6, 2010 that AWRT will now be known as the Alliance for Women in Media. The name change was approved by an overwhelming majority vote of the membership in early 2010. The organization’s leadership began discussing a name change nearly two years ago as a part of its multi-year strategic planning process. A twelve-month roll out of the new name and logo is planned for
both the national organization and its local chapters.
According to the organization, new name:
Advocacy.
Over the past few years, AWRT has worked hard to promote ownership opportunities for women and minorities in the communications industry. AWRT supports the effort to enhance equal employment opportunity for women and minorities in communication effective and efficient. AWRT is also involved in the efforts to improve and diversify telecommunication and media industry ownership.
Publications.
AWRT publishes a quarterly magazine, "Making Waves". Each issue includes articles about the latest in legislation, radio and television, and industry news.

Trimeresurus flavoviridis

Trimeresurus flavoviridis is a venomous pit viper species endemic to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Description.
Growing to an average total length of 4–5 feet (122–152 cm), with a maximum total length of 7.9 feet/242 cm (caught in 2011 at Onna, Okinawa), it is the largest member of its genus. It is slenderly built and gracefully proportioned with a large head. The tail, however, is not prehensile.
Scalation includes 35 (sometimes 31, 33, 37 or 39) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 217-239 ventral scales, 72-95 subcaudal scales, and 7-10 supralabial scales. The crown is covered with small scales.
The color pattern consists of a light olive of brown ground color, overlaid with elongated dark green or brownish blotches. The blotches have yellow edges, sometimes contain yellow spots, and frequently fuse to produce wavy stripes. The belly is whitish with dark coloring along the edges.
Common names.
, Okinawa habu, yellow-green tree viper, , Okinawan habu, Kume Shima habu (for "T. f. tinkhami").
Geographic range.
"Trimeresurus flavoviridis" is found in Japan in the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa and the Amami Islands. The type locality given is "Amakarima Island (one of the Loo-Choo group)" (= Keramashima, Ryukyu Islands).
It is common on the larger volcanic islands, but not present on the smaller coral islands 
Habitat.
Often reported in the transition zone between palm forest and cultivated fields. Found on rock walls and in old tombs and caves.
Behavior.
Terrestrial and mostly nocturnal, it often enters homes and other structures in search of rats and mice. Bold and irritable, it can strike quickly and has a long reach.
Reproduction.
Oviparous, it is one of the few pitvipers that lays eggs. Mating takes place in early spring and up to 18 eggs are laid in mid-summer. The hatchlings, which emerge after an incubation period of 5–6 weeks, are 10 inches (25 cm) in length and look the same as the adults.
Predators.
To reduce the population of "T. flavoviridis" on the island of Okinawa, the small Indian mongoose, "Herpestes javanicus", was introduced in 1910. Although the effects of this introduction have not been studied, in other such cases the negative effects on species of native birds, mammals, and herpetofauna have been a source of concern for wildlife managers.
Venom.
The incidence of snakebite in the Amami Islands is 2 per 1,000 people, which is very high. The venom of this species is of high toxicity, yet the fatality rate is less than 1%. If a bite victim receives medical care promptly, bites are not life-threatening. However, 6-8% do suffer permanent disability.
Brown (1973) gives values of 3.1, 4.3, 3.7, 2.7, 3.7, 3.8 mg/kg IV, 5.1 mg/kg IP and 6.0, 3.5-5.0, 4.5 mg/kg SC for toxicity.
Exploitation.
On the island of Okinawa, this species is heavily collected, primarily for use in habu sake. Actually not sake, but a stronger liquor called awamori, it is alleged to have medicinal properties. The production includes the snakes in the fermentation process and it is sold in bottles that may or may not contain the body of a snake.

University of New Orleans Federal Credit Union

The UNO Federal Credit Union, or UNOFCU, was chartered in 1972 by the National Credit Union Administration
(NCUA) to serve the faculty, staff, and students of the University of New Orleans (UNO). Currently located in New Orleans, Louisiana, it has one branch located on the Lakefront main campus of UNO and serves approximately 4,000 members, with assets of over $20 Million USD. UNOFCU is also a member of the East Orleans Chapter of the Louisiana Credit Union League.
History.
First housed in the Physical Plant Services building of the then Louisiana State University in New Orleans campus, UNOFCU opened as the financial institution to the UNO community. Over the last 35 years, it has moved 3 times: to the campus Administration building, the Math building, and finally to its current home in the Homer L. Hitt Alumni Center in 2003, allowing it to offer drive-up window service alongside its normal lobby service. UNOFCU has also grown to serve not only the students, faculty, and staff, but also contract workers, alumni, and student organizations. Having only one branch, the credit union relies on the CU Service Centers network to help its members who are spread around the country.
UNOFCU received a $299,000 NCUA no-interest loan through its Community Development Revolving Loan Fund after sustaining severe damage during Hurricane Katrina.
Membership.
Eligibility for membership is instant upon becoming a student, alumni, employee, or contract worker of UNO and also extends to the immediate family members of current members. UNOFCU has a policy of "once a member, always a member", meaning that even when an employee leaves the university, he or she is still eligible to remain a member for as long as he or she chooses.
Current Officials.
UNOFCU's Board of Directors and Credit Committee, respectively made up of seven and five officials, are elected by and from the credit union's membership at the annual meetings held every March. The Board then appoints three supervisory committee officials.

Seventh Church of Christ, Scientist (Seattle, Washington)

The former Seventh Church of Christ, Scientist, located at 2555 8th Avenue, West (corner of West Halladay Street) in the Queen Anne Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, is an historic Christian Science church edifice. Built in 1926, it was designed by noted Seattle architect Harlan Thomas in the Neo-Byzantine, Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial styles. It consists of two parts joined together to form an ell: the 2-story main section containing the church auditorium (the term Christian Scientists use instead of sanctuary) and a one story wing containing the Sunday School. The main section is square but each corner has been "flattened to form an irregular octagon.
Due to declining membership and increased costs of maintaining the property, Seventh Church decided to sell the property in the late 1980s, but had no offers until 2006 when a developer offered to buy the property for redevelopment if the church could obtain a demolition permit from the city. The city did issue the permit in February 2007, but when neighbors appealed, a hearing examiner sent the permit back for further review. The property was then put on the Washington Trust for Historic Preservation's list of "Most Endangered Historic Properties" and the Queen Anne Historical Society spearheaded community efforts to find a buyer willing to preserve the property. The Seattle Church of Christ, a congregation of approximately 270, had looked at the property previously but had felt the then $2 million plus price was out its reach. With the price reduced to $1.6 million and Seventh Church agreeing to take a low down payment and to provide short term financing, Seattle Church of Christ was able to close on the property on August 31, 2007.
Seventh Church of Christ, Scientist is now located at 1261 Madison Street in Seattle. Seattle Church of Christ has made short term improvements to shore up the property and has long range plans to restore it.

A Carlebach Minyan is a Jewish prayer service that follows the style of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach and uses the melodies he composed for many prayers. 
These minyanim are distinctive for their emphasis on singing the liturgy, often using Carlebach's original nigunim. According to Rabbi Jonathan Rosenblatt, Carlebach "changed the expectations of the prayer experience from decorous and somber to uplifting and ecstatic as he captivated generations with elemental melodies and stories of miraculous human saintliness, modesty and unselfishness.

Clarke City is a town in the Quebec region of Côte-Nord, located roughly thirty kilometers west of Sept-Îles, on the Sainte-Marguerite River near Route 138. The name of the town originated from the Clarke brothers who established a paper mill there in 1903 to feed their publication house in Toronto. They also built a hydroelectric factory in 1908 and that year, the village was officially founded as the region's first closed city. Also that year, the registers of the Saint-Cœur-de-Marie Parish began, counting some 400 persons in Clarke City.

Active Value Investing

Active Value Investing: Making Money in Range-Bound Markets (Wiley, 2007) is a book written by Vitaliy Katsenelson, and describes a strategy for sideways stock market. In the first part of the book Katsenelson makes an argument that for next dozen years or so the US market will be range-bound. In the second part he provides a strategy for this market. Investors look at stock market as a 11% a year compounding machine, and though this is true for the long-run (a full market cycle, 30 years or longer), in the short run stock market returns are often far above or far below the average. As Katsenelson argues in his book - returns are to large degree a function of starting valuation. High valuation leads to below average returns, low valuations lead to above average returns.
Katsenelson's BusinessWeek video interview and a fairly lengthy article he wrote for John Mauldin's [http://ContrarianEdge.com/2008/04/20/is-it-a-bull-bear-or-cowardly-lion-market/ newsletter describe concepts of Active Value Investing in great detail.

Vitaliy Katsenelson is Chief Investment Officer at Investment Management Associates in Denver. He is an author of "The Little Book of Sideways Markets" (John Wiley & Sons, 2010) and "Active Value Investing: Making Money in Range-Bound Markets" (John Wiley & Sons, 2007). Katsenelson often holds contrarian views that are ahead of his time but that with the passage of time turn into mainstream views:
The Chinese real estate bubble: In articles that appeared in "Foreign Policy" magazine, "The Christian Science Monitor", "Institutional Investor" magazine, and in presentations around the world, including at the Johns Hopkins University / Applied Physics Laboratory Rethinking Seminar Series, and in Chapter 15 of "The Little Book of Sideways Markets", Katsenelson has argued that the Chinese economy is in the midst of an overcapacity bubble of enormous proportions.
Sideways markets: In 2007, in "Active Value Investing: Making Money in Range-Bound Markets", Katsenelson argued that the US stock market will be range-bound for another decade. In 2010 he followed up with another book, "The Little Book of Sideways Markets", this one written for a wider audience, in which he continued to make the argument but changed the term "range-bound market" to "sideways market." Katsenelson also expressed this view in articles he wrote for "Institutional Investor" and John Mauldin's "Thoughts from the Frontline", and in interviews with "Barron's" magazine and CNBC. Katsenelson writes a monthly column, "Inefficient Markets," for "Institutional Investor" magazine.
Japan: Starting in 2008 (and most recently in May 2013, in John Mauldin's "Outside the Box"), Katsenelson has made the case that Japan, after two decades of deflation, would soon reach a tipping point where it would have to either shop its debt outside of Japan or resort to massive quantitative easing. It has of course chosen the latter course.
Vitaliy's books have been translated into Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, German, and Romanian.
Each year in June, Vitaliy hosts VALUEx Vail, an invitation-only conference where serious value investors share ideas and learn from each other's experiences, while enjoying family fun in the gorgeous Colorado Rockies.

Waithood

Waithood (a portmanteau of "wait" and "adulthood") is a period of stagnation in the lives of young unemployed college graduates in the Middle East, India, North Africa, etc. (MENA) region, described as "a kind of prolonged adolescence", and "the bewildering time in which large proportions of Middle Eastern youth spend their best years waiting. It is a phase in which the difficulties youth face in each of these interrelated spheres of life result in a debilitating state of helplessness and dependency. Waithood can be best understood by examining outcomes and linkages across five different sectors: education, employment, housing, credit, and marriage." 
Waithood is applicable only to college educated people who are not compelled to settle in blue collar jobs due to the support from family elders or resources. Waithood is considered to be a difficult and unpleasant period in life; without work, young people are unable to progress in other areas of their development, such as purchasing a home and getting married.

Grand Duchy of the Lagoan Isles

The Grand Duchy of the Lagoan Isles is a micronation based in Britain. It was created in 2005 by school teacher Louis Robert Harold Stephens ("Grand Duke Louis", born 1985) as a class project, and claims as its territory Baffins Pond, in Portsmouth, along with the three tiny islands located within the pond. However, the Grand Duchy does not have a physical presence in, or exercise any authority over the area, and its operations are largely limited to the Internet.
History.
Records of Baffins Farm (including the pond) date back to 1194. Since then it has changed hands several times. In the 19th century it was used by local farmers, and in 1912 it became a public park. In 1938 it was saved from demolition, and sold to the City of Portsmouth. Stephens established the Grand Duchy's putative claim to the pond islands on August 16, 2005, after noticing that they were not specifically mentioned in the 1938 land sale contract. He subsequently sent a letter announcing his claim to Portsmouth council, and released a series of banknotes with an ornithological theme.

Lancashire Union Railway

The Lancashire Union Railway ran between Blackburn and St Helens in Lancashire, England. It was built primarily to carry goods between Blackburn and Garston Dock on the River Mersey, and also to serve collieries in the Wigan area. Most of the line has now closed, except for the St Helens-to-Wigan section that forms part of the main line between Liverpool and the North.
History.
The Lancashire Union Railway (LUR) was authorised by Parliamentary Act of 25 July 1864 to build a line from the Blackbrook branch of the St Helens Railway to Adlington on the Bolton-to-Preston line of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) near Chorley. This connected with existing lines between and St Helens. A further act of 13 July 1868 authorised an extension from to , and vested the section between (on the North Union Railway (NUR) north of Wigan) and (on the LYR near Blackburn) jointly with the LYR.
The whole line between St Helens and Blackburn opened to passengers on 1 December 1869. Most passenger services were local between Blackburn and Wigan. LNWR trains travelled to the station later known as via Chorley and Boar's Head, but LYR trains used an alternative route between Chorley and the station later to become via .
The LUR also built a line, the "Whelley Loop", that bypassed Wigan to the east. It opened in 1869, mainly for freight. Stations at and Amberswood were open for only three months between 1 January and 1 March 1872. Additional connections were made to the NUR's West Coast Main Line north and south of Wigan in 1882 and 1886 respectively, and to other lines radiating from Wigan, thus allowing many trains to bypass Wigan.
The LUR company was vested jointly between the LNWR and LYR from 16 July 1883, until the two parent companies merged on 1 January 1922.
The Blackburn-to-Chorley line closed to passengers on 4 January 1960 and to goods in 1966, although a short section between Cherry Tree and continued until 1968. The Chorley-to-Wigan line also closed to passengers in 1960, and to goods on 25 May 1971. The Whelley Loop survived until 1976. The Wigan-to-St Helens section is still in use as part of the Liverpool to Wigan Line.
Route.
The line began at Blackburn and followed the East Lancashire Line to Cherry Tree where the line branched to Feniscowles; here remnants of the bridge that carried the railway over the A6062 Livesey road can clearly be seen. From here the line is more a less undeveloped minus the fact that gravel and rails are missing, the line carries on where the M65 motorway is now, towards .
The line between Withnell and Brinscall now forms Railway Park. Leaving Brinscall the line ran parallel to Lodge Bank Road and has been built on. At Brinscall Hall there is an old bridge carrying the railway over a footpath which is still intact. The line of the railway is still evident as it passes Wheelton Plantation towards Heapey. Before Heapey the line passes the former ROF Heapey site where there were sidings serving the plant. Heapey Station is now a private residence. The line had another siding which intersected two of the Heapey reservoirs before serving the Heapey Bleachworks; half of the bridge carrying the line over Higher House Lane to the works is still in situ. The line continued under a bridge under Tithe Barn Lane toward the Blackburn-Chorley road (again under an existing bridge) towards the arched viaduct at Botany Bay which carried the line over the Leeds-Liverpool Canal towards Chorley. The viaduct was demolished in 1968 to make way for the M61 motorway.
The line continued past the North Gate estate and past the rear of St. Joseph's Church where it crossed Highfield Road and ran parallel to the Manchester-Preston Line on an embankment (now a footpath). The line headed towards where Friday Street car park now stands where it merged with the main line and entered Chorley station. The LUR uses the main line to Adlington where the line branched off and under the A6 along the Leeds-Liverpool Canal and on to White Bear Station. On leaving the station the line continued parallel to the canal bypassing the town of Blackrod to the east.
The line followed the canal to the station at Red Rock. It continued south and split as it neared Pendlebury Lane. The first route; the Whelley Loop which bypassed Wigan was built to serve collieries and iron works before the loop split at De Trafford junction joining the Manchester-Southport Line just before Hindley railway station to the East and to Amberswood to the West, before re-joining the LUR at Bryn or heading further south to Warrington via the NUR. The second route headed over a viaduct, the 13 Bridges which carried the railway over the River Douglas. The bridges are known locally as the dominoes due to the position and shape of the pillars and are the only parts left standing. After the viaduct the line continued to Boar's Head before connecting with the Blackpool to Liverpool Line. The line then continued through Wigan North Western before heading towards Bryn and before eventually joining the St Helens Railway, and continuing to its southern terminus at .

Grace Golden

Grace Lydia Golden (2 April 1904 – 3 June 1993), was an English illustrator and historian.
Early life.
Grace Golden (Associate of the Royal College of Art) was born to a working-class family in east London. After her education at the City of London School for Girls, she won a scholarship to the Chelsea College of Art, where she studied from 1920-1923. She progressed from there to the Royal College of Art, where she first studied and later taught at from 1926-1927.
Career.
Her career in book illustration began in the early 1930s. She received a small legacy in 1934 which enabled her to work on exhibition pieces. Working in both watercolours and oil paint, she exhibited at the Royal Academy, as well as the Fine Art Society and The Leicester Gallery.
Golden received a commission from The Pilgrim Trust to make illustrations of historic buildings and landmarks during World War II, as well as her work appearing in touring exhibitions.
Later, she worked for the Ministry of Information – painstakingly producing illustrations which were used to aid the reading of educational books. Posters promoting safe working practice were produced from her illustrations, many of which were used to stress the hazards of a mixed sex workforce within wartime manufacturing environments, with slogans such as ‘Keep your mind on the job – and save your knuckles’.
Golden had always been interested in the working life of the Thames. Since she had been a child she had witnessed the lives of the industrious people who were employed near and on the river. She had witnessed much of this life from being the age of 5, when her parents had moved to a five-storey house at the City End of Southwark Bridge. This fascination led to her producing her "Old Bankside" book. Her work also frequently appeared in the "Swift" annual (1957–1961).
Years later, Sam Wanamaker invited Golden to become an honorary archivist to the Bear Gardens Museum project.
Final years.
Grace Golden died on 3 June 1993, aged 89 at the Royal Free Hospital. She had, during her last years, become something of a recluse, having closed herself off from the world around her and living a life of frugality and simplicity. Her work, which was popular with many writers, including Enid Blyton, will be remembered for its attention to detail, which now makes her work of distinctive historical value.
Some of her work is exhibited at the Tate Gallery and The National Archives. At Golders Green Crematorium, London, there is a commemorative plaque to her.

Atlantica Online

Atlantica Online is a free-to-play (F2P) 3D massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by NDOORS Corporation. The game is set in an alternate history Earth, the explorable regions including large parts of the world: Europe, Asia, North America, Africa and the mythical and name-giving continent of Atlantis. The setting is fantasy-themed with elements of steampunk and based upon mythological and historical events.
Gameplay.
The game features a persistent world populated by player-generated characters and Non-player characters (NPCs). The player can choose from eleven different classes - each unique in its abilities and weapons - and customize their appearance. A distinguishing feature of the game is that accompanying the main character are up to eight mercenaries, each one almost as powerful as his or her leader. There are more than 40 different mercenary classes and those not currently following the main character can be stored and exchanged at any time.
In addition to their battle skills, all players may pursue a number of different crafting abilities that are advanced simultaneously to the normal gameplay instead of separately.
The game design puts strong emphasis on the concept of guilds. Guilds can control the various towns on the game map. Strong guilds can found nations and wage war on one another. Guilds and nations offer various benefits to their members such as passive boosts and 'Guild Crafting' where every member of a guild helps to advance a specific crafting process.
Battle in Atlantica Online is rather unusual for the genre as it is turn-based. Representations of hostile parties wander around the landscape; if a player clicks on such a representation, his/her party and the enemy party are transferred to a separate battlefield similar in fashion to battles in console role playing games and remain there until the battle is resolved. The battle system also features a time limit for a player to make their move.
Currently, China has been IP blocked from Atlantica.
Setting.
The world of Atlantica Online features real world locations mixed with mythological and fantasy elements. Countries like Germany and China are represented, with cities like Munich, Moscow, and Sapporo as visitable hubs that offer services like banks, hospitals, the marketplace where players can trade goods with each other and other facilities. Though the locations on the map feature climates similar to their real world counterparts, the architecture is often a generic recreation of well known structure types, such as the cities in Eastern Europe and Japan.
The locations are based on real world locations, but are often geographically out of place and altered for effect. Most of the civilizations represented are anachronistic: Rome is set in the Holy Roman Empire, while Great Britain is independent, the Ottoman Empire reigns in Turkey, Southeast Asia resembles ancient Indian kingdoms before Western colonization and Islamic influence, and North America is caught up in the Industrial Revolution.
On December 18, 2008, the North American continent was added, which features New York as a new explorable city and the United States and Mexico as explorable countries. These contain a few dungeons, but greatly expand the map in Atlantica. Developers have also mentioned the possibility of adding the continents of the Southern Hemisphere, excluding Antarctica.
Mercenaries.
After beginning the game players can recruit mercenaries to join them in their travels. Users can have up to 8 mercenaries fight alongside in battle, and shuffle their lineup as the situation calls for. Mercenaries, like your main character, advance in both level and rank as they get stronger. Currently there are more than 40 different mercenary classes that differ in their skills, preferred method of attack (melee, ranged and magic attacks) and other characteristics.
Original battle system.
The game's original battle system is unusual for its genre in that it uses a turn-based system.
When a player character and an enemy character come into contact with each other on the game map, both parties are transported into an instance where the battle takes place. During battle other players' groups and other monster groups may join in to a maximum of three groups on each side.
In battle, the characters of each party are positioned on a 3x3 grid. The positioning of each mercenary and the main character is determined by the player outside of battle. However, it is possible to modify the positioning by moving the characters around during his/her turn. Using attacks and abilities, the goal is to beat the opponent. The rewards include experience points and loot like the game's virtual currency, various materials, pieces of equipment etc.
The battles require tactical decisions under time pressure.
Tactical battle system.
The Tactical battle system (TBS) is a separate, additional combat system that differs in many respects from the original system. Players and their adversaries are placed in a landscape where moving around characters freely is possible. New decision impacts like the possibility to take cover, different height levels and the movement speed of specific characters are added while certain mechanics of the original combat system are removed.
Player versus player.
Player versus player-combat (PvP) in Atlantica Online happens in two different league systems, the 'Free League' and the later added 'Colosseum League'.
PvP in both Leagues takes place in the Original Battle System.
Nine times per day a league will open and offer the opportunity to fight against other players for one hour. Besides the aspect of fun through fighting intelligent opponents and pitting one's strength against other players the rewards also include experience points, loot and special titles that can be displayed with one's character name.
Every weekend a Weekly Championship is held with greater rewards including a special 'mount' (a steed your main character can ride on and receive bonuses from it).
Every month the Grand Championship determines the best player in PvP across all servers of the region and offers the best rewards.
PvP in Atlantica Online is balanced through several mechanics meant to provide as fair a challenge as possible for the participants. For example, all special abilities are modified and can differ a lot from their PvE versions.
While the Free League is with intent meant to be influenced by the quality of equipment the opponents wear, the Colosseum League in contrast normalizes most attributes to make the 'skill' of both players the strongest impact on the result of a match.
Once per week a special PvP event called 'Spelltower Siege', implemented September 7, 2011, is held that uses the Tactical Battle System and allows players of all regional servers to meet on a battlefield and fight against each other for a strong buff that lasts for a full 7 days until the next Spelltower battle.
Independent dungeons.
A dungeon in Atlantica Online is an instance region that can be opened with a special key and allows up to 3 players to clean the dungeon of enemies for a final reward in addition to the normal loot.
Independent Dungeons, commonly called 'IDs', have a time limit and their setting is usually tied to that of the region the ID is located in. For example, 'Lerna's Labyrinth' in Greece features a story loosely based on the minotaur featured in a poem of Ovid.
The dungeons require a minimum level and are set so that throughout the entire level range there is always at least one suitable dungeon.
New independent dungeons are added to the game frequently.
Guild and nation dungeons (see Community Features) are a special subset of independent dungeons in that they allow a large number of players to enter but only if these belong to the guild or nation that made entry to the dungeon possible by using a key.
Raid dungeons.
On May 30, 2012 the first Raid Dungeon, Labyrinthos, was introduced to Atlantica Online with the 'Elements of War - Incursio' patch.
All raid dungeons use the Tactical Battle System and in contrast to TBS missions no mercenaries are allowed. Up to 10 players can participate in the Labyrinthos raid dungeon, each with his or her main character only. The boss monster is extremely powerful so the fewer players attempt the dungeon the better their gear and coordination has to be.
While other battles in Atlantica Online do not require main characters to fill specific roles as is usual in many other MMORPGs like World of Warcraft the raid dungeons are designed for exactly this purpose. Tanks, healers and damage dealers are necessary to succeed.
With the first part of the major 'Rise of Atlantis' content update, 'Awakening', another raid dungeon called 'Forgotten City' has been introduced on April 17, 2013. Up to 15 players can enter this dungeon.
The third raid dungeon in Atlantica Online is 'Centaur Hero' and was introduced shortly after with the second part of the 'Rise of Atlantis' update ('Ascension') on May 8, 2013.
Missions.
Missions are objective-driven battles that use the Tactical Battle System and are held together by a storyline. All missions belong to a story arc, for instance the ones based on the Trojan Wars or on events surrounding the African legendary hero Mwindo. Every story arc has several missions attached to it.
Missions take place on unique maps that include script events and changing objectives such as escorting or protecting allied NPCs, destroying specific buildings or reaching a point on the map.
In addition to the usual rewards of battling NPCs (experience points and loot) players receive a generous amount of additional experience points and valuable treasure chests for completing a mission successfully.
Entering missions is limited by points that are reset weekly and can be increased on a daily basis by the player.
Missions were first introduced with the Troy story arc on August 17, 2010.
Crafting system.
In difference to many other popular MMORPGs crafting in Atlantica Online happens simultaneously to fighting and is not a separate process. The game features a largely player-driven economy in which looting mobs normally yields inferior results to crafting and the subsequent process of enhancing the results via multiple different means. However, most materials needed for crafting are directly or indirectly acquired by fighting and looting mobs. This makes grinding for the pure value of loot rather inefficient and puts an emphasis on using the loot to craft something.
In contrast to 'drops' (loot) from NPCs the results of crafting can be of a higher quality level than usual.
Jackpot system.
A noteworthy feature distinguishing Atlantica Online from other MMORPGs is the players' ability to gamble the loot obtained in battles with mobs. This 'Jackpot System' adds a layer of unpredictability and chance to the process of gathering materials from mobs. The optional use of the Jackpot 'transmutes' (changes) different materials into a specific type. The outcome is influenced by some internal factors that are not readily available so trial and error is involved in finding a good combination of inputs and outputs. Some useful information has been gathered by the community. Depending on the choice of inputs and output the Jackpot will either generate a net profit or loss. The profit or loss also varies due to a random modifier.
My Home housing system.
'Housing' allows players to purchase a virtual home from a variety of styles and sizes.
Owning a house has multiple advantages for the player:
Housing was introduced on August 17, 2010.
Community features.
Players of Atlantica Online can form guilds and nations. The latter are made up of guilds that have decided to work together.
Being member of a guild and nation offers the player several important advantages:
Other community-focused features include benefits for playing in a group or its larger type, a squad.
There is also a 'referral' system that offers advantages for both referrer and referee player. It is meant to provide new players with an experienced 'mentor' that can help them and answer their questions.
Release.
The international English version, available worldwide, is distributed by the USA subsidiary company NDOORS Interactive, Inc.. A closed beta version was made available to FilePlanet subscribers on July 15, 2008. The first phase of the open beta ended on July 28, 2008; the start of the second phase began on August 7, 2008. On October 30, 2008 at 11a.m. PDT, Atlantica Online ended its beta period and began its official run at 6p.m. PDT on October 30, 2008. NDOORS also launches Atlantica Online Germany, for European players, on the October 21. The closed Beta started on September 1 and ended after a month. The Chinese company The9 has obtained exclusive rights for distributing and operating Atlantica Online in China. Russian localized version open beta test started May 12, 2010 supported by Innova Systems company.
Item Mall.
The Item Mall is a service provided by Nexon. In exchange for paying real money (not a virtual currency) via different possible ways like Paypal, direct debiting system or credit card players can obtain special virtual clothing, mounts, buffs etc.
In compliance with the definition of 'Free to Play' (F2P) using the service is purely voluntary. There are no restrictions on Main or mercenary classes, zones, professions, PvP or PvE content that need paying for to be removed. Most of the goods offered through the Item Mall are tradable for the virtual currency of the game thus enabling players who do not wish to pay real money to buy them as well.
Major content updates.
Atlantica's publisher and developer, NDOORS Interactive, regularly releases new content updates. Non-Korean servers generally receive the updates after the Korean servers. Additionally, while Korean servers receive many smaller updates, NDOORS usually combines the updates into fewer, but larger releases for the international servers. Updates include, for instance, new dungeons, quests, NPCs, skills, mercenaries, outfits, equipment, mounts, and community features while also adjusting the existing game experience such as improving PvP balance and the rate of obtaining experience points or specific loot.
Game Developer's Conference 2009.
At the Game Developers Conference 2009 on March 26, NDOORS announced several major content updates to arrive in 2009.
Troy story arc.
Implemented on August 17, 2010, the Troy Story Arc is a series of 'missions' following the format of the Tactical Battle System (TBS) that was introduced in the same patch. In each mission one or more players take part in a fantasy version of the Trojan War. The rewards include generous amounts of experience points and valuable chests containing loot.
Introduction of Atlantis.
In April 2013, the first part of the major content update 'Rise of Atlantis' was released. May 2013 saw the second part and the third part is scheduled for June 2013.
The update is the most extensive to date, introducing a new continent to explore (mythical Atlantis), new mercenary classes, new equipment, content and several changes to other features of the game.
Reception.
Reception of "Atlantica Online" has been highly positive, receiving a number of awards in 2008. The game is acclaimed for its innovative turn-based battle system and its integration with community features. Danny Gourley of Ten Ton Hammer praised its gameplay, stating "it requires gamers to think a little instead of just mashing buttons". It has been selected as an official game for the Korean Game and Game World Championship for two years in a row (2008, 2009).

Jacob Kielland was a member of the prominent family of Kielland. He was born in Stavanger to Gabriel Schanche Kielland (1760-1821) and his wife Johanna Margaretha (1756-1818), née Bull. He had three older and two younger siblings, but his youngest sister Elisabeth only survived for a month, and the oldest brother Jacob died at the age of 1. His oldest living brother Jens Bull Kielland became a military officer, and his youngest brother Jonas Schanche Kielland became a politician.
Jacob Kielland married Axeliane Christine Zetlitz (1792-1855), daughter of the priest and poet Jens Zetlitz. The couple had five sons and five daughters. Of these children, four died young. Those who survived included:

Jacob Kielland took education from 1802 to 1806, and after that started working in his father's company "Jacob Kielland & Søn". As his father died in 1821, Jacob and Jonas Schanche Kielland took over the company. Jacob Kielland acquired burghership in June 1821. The trade company mainly exported timber, lobsters and atlantic herring. Like many traders they were also involved in shipbuilding, running two shipyards.
Jacob Kielland was also vice consul for the Netherlands in 1815, Hamburg and Prussia in 1821 and the United States in 1830. The latter relation was broken in 1863, shortly before his death. Kielland was also involved in local politics, as a member of Stavanger city council.

Hanksville-Burpee Quarry

Hanksville-Burpee Quarry is the name given a paleontological excavation site approximately wide by long near Hanksville, Utah where scientists have found a large mix of remains of sauropods, trees, freshwater clams, and other species dating between 145 million years ago to 150 million years ago. The mixed assortment of remains deposited in this one location provide a unique opportunity to scientists to study the paleoecology of the area in the late Jurassic period.
In June 2008 following three weeks of excavation, paleontologists from the Burpee Museum of Natural History and Western Illinois University announced major recent discoveries made at the site, including a probable Stegosaurus, four sauropods, and at least two carnivorous dinosaurs. The researchers expressed confidence that future excavations at the site will come to rival those produced from Dinosaur National Monument and the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, two major sources of giant Jurassic reptile remains.
The site is located on federal land overseen by the United States Bureau of Land Management and is part of the Morrison Formation, which is a significant source for the largest known dinosaur remains. Paleogeographic evidence indicates that the Hanksville-Burpee Quarry area was situated at the bend of a large river during time of sediment deposition. Researchers point to the large number of animal remains collected at the single location, and suggest the river bend acted as a trap for carcasses of large animals that died upriver and were carried downstream by high waters.

C4mim is a shorthand for 1-"n"-butyl-3-methylimidazolium salts. These are ionic liquids based on imidazole chemistry. A common example of such is , or 1-"n"-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. These salts are currently of interest in industry due their ability to be infinitely recycled and their amenability to solvation at room temperature, making them excellent green solvents. C4mim is based on the parent compound 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole with one electron removed from the imidazole arene group. The stability of this cation lies in the fact that the resulting electronic vacancy is delocalised across the arene group, albeit unequally so.

Up All Night (30 Rock)

"Up All Night" is the thirteenth episode of NBC's first season of "30 Rock". It was written by the series' creator and executive producer Tina Fey, and was directed by Michael Engler. It first aired on February 8, 2007 in the United States. Guest stars in this episode include Katrina Bowden, Rachel Dratch, Rachel Hamilton, John Lutz, Maulik Pancholy, Keith Powell, Lonny Ross, Isabella Rossellini, Sherri Shepherd, Jason Sudeikis and Mark Zimmerman. Joy Behar appeared as herself in the episode.
This episode focuses on the events of Valentine's Day for the cast and crew of "TGS with Tracy Jordan", a fictional sketch comedy series. Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) receives a mysterious gift; Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) comments that he hates Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski); Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) forgets Valentine's Day, which also happens to be his wife, Paula's (Paula Pell) birthday; Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) divorce from Bianca (Isabella Rossellini) is made official; the writers believe that Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden) has romantic feelings for Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer); and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to spend a night with his wife, Angie Jordan (Sherri Shephard).
Plot.
Jack's wife Bianca asks to finalize their divorce to which Jack agree, demanding various things in their settlement all to which she agrees, and the divorce is set for the next day. It is Valentine's Day, although the "TGS" cast and crew still have to work all night. Frank reveals that he hates Jenna when he always chooses to "kill" Jenna in a game of "Marry, Boff, Kill". Frank believes that Jenna is "phony", and Jenna tries many times to redeem herself with Frank, with reasons such as her participation in Vagina Day: "a charity event founded by a group of celebrities who have for whatever reason never been asked to participate in The Vagina Monologues". Eventually, in her final confrontation with Frank, she farts, but Frank is happy, telling her that that is the first real thing she has done, and the two reconcile. Another game of "Marry, Boff, Kill" leads some of the writers into believing that Cerie (who has been having problems with her fiance Aris) has feelings for Kenneth when she chooses to "boff" him. The writers send the pair off to get candy for the night. Kenneth and Cerie take a walk around Rockefeller Center, and Cerie reveals that she is not attracted to Kenneth but tells him that he can tell the others that the two made out. However, Kenneth fails to convince the writers that he has done so when he shows them a pair of male underpants, which he claims belong to Cerie.
Jack asks Tracy to have a drink with him to celebrate his impending divorce, but Tracy has to leave early to celebrate Valentine's Day with his wife through "role-play". As Jack gets more and more drunk, he reveals that he still has various fantasies about his wife from grabbing one of her breasts to her getting various terminal diseases with him by her bedside. Eventually, he picks up a prostitute (Rachel Dratch), and the two interrupt Tracy and Angie's Valentine's Day at the Soho Grand Hotel. Angie, upset that their Valentine's Day is ruined, demands that Tracy get rid of Jack and the prostitute, so he calls Liz for help. Liz gets Jack and the drunk prostitute out of the hotel, and Liz tells Jack that his relationship with his wife is sick and presents him with a scenario of "Marry, Boff, Kill", all with his wife, causing Jack to say that he wants to do all of the three but promises Liz that he will get over his wife, and the two leave the prostitute in the street. The next day, Jack and Bianca sign the divorce papers, and Bianca begs Jack not to sell the Arby's that he had gotten in their settlement. He promises not to do so, but will let the place shut down and become desolate. The two argue, and the sexual tension between the two escalate, until Bianca tears herself away from Jack and leaves.
Pete has forgotten that it is Valentine's Day, which also happens to be his wife Paula's birthday. He spends the night running around the city to try and find Valentine's Day and birthday presents for his wife, only to lose the balloons that he had bought for his wife. Liz has received a gift of chocolate-covered cherries and flowers from a supposed secret admirer. The "admirer" turns out to be "a law stylist", (Jason Sudeikis) and the gifts turn out to be for his girlfriend, Liz Lemler, who works in the accounting department at "TGS". However, he tells Liz to keep the flowers but asks for a picture of her with the flowers and her ID to prove to his girlfriend that he did indeed get her something for Valentine's Day.
Production.
Jason Sudeikis, who played Floyd in this episode, has appeared in the main cast of "Saturday Night Live". Tina Fey was the head writer on "Saturday Night Live" from 1999 until 2006. Various other cast members of "Saturday Night Live" have appeared on "30 Rock". These cast members include: Rachel Dratch, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Will Forte, Chris Parnell and Molly Shannon. Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of "Saturday Night Live". Alec Baldwin has also hosted "Saturday Night Live" thirteen times, the second highest amount of episodes of any host of the series.
Reception.
"Up All Night" brought in an average of 5.2 million viewers. The episode also achieved a 2.5/6 in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds in the U.S., and the 6 refers to 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S..
Matt Webb Mitovich of "TV Guide" wrote that "it would be nearly impossible to measure up to last week's utterly manic introduction of Prince Gerhardt [Paul Ruebens], so forgive "30 Rock" if this week's outing was 'merely' very amusing at times." He added that compared to Jack's storyline, he "actually wore more grins watching the microscopic B-story with the writers, playing Marry, Boff, Kill." Robert Canning of IGN thought that "the Valentine's Day episode of "30 Rock" gave us a big surprise: a low-key half hour from a show known for being over the top," adding that this was "a pleasant surprise". He said that this episode "proved that ["30 Rock"] could make with the funny no matter what the tone". Canning rated this episode 8.5 out of 10.

Jimmy Dunn (footballer born 1923)

James "Jimmy" Dunn (born 25 November 1923 in Edinburgh) is a Scottish former footballer, who spent the majority of his league career with Wolverhampton Wanderers. He is the son of the Scottish international footballer James Dunn.
Career.
Dunn, raised in Liverpool, joined Wolves as an apprentice in 1941, signing professionally the following year. The start of his official league career was delayed due to World War II - though he made 100 unofficial wartime appearances - and the 1946/47 season found him limited to just three appearances.
He broke through in the following campaign and was also a regular player in the next season, which saw him win the 1949 FA Cup. A back injury sidelined him for most of the 1949/50 season, but he recovered to feature strongly during the next two years. He eventually left Molineux to join Derby County in 1953 for £15,000.
After suffering relegation to the third tier with Derby in 1955, he dropped into the non-league with Worcester City, and later also played for Runcorn.
Upon retiring from the game, he ran a pub in Penn, West Midlands before qualifying as a physiotherapist. In this role, he became a trainer at West Bromwich Albion in 1963 and was on the bench at the 1967 League Cup and 1968 FA Cup finals. After leaving the club, he ran his own clinic in Edgbaston, a gym in Birmingham and also worked as a 'rep' in Dudley.

PollyVote

The PollyVote project uses the high-profile application of predicting U.S. presidential election results to demonstrate advances in forecasting research. The project is run by political science professors and forecasting experts, one of which is J. Scott Armstrong. All procedures, data, and results are fully disclosed and freely available online.
The project started in March 2004 to demonstrate the benefits of combining forecasts. In averaging forecasts within and across different forecasting methods, the combined PollyVote forecast provided highly accurate predictions of the two-party popular vote shares for the last three U.S. presidential elections.
History.
The PollyVote was created in March 2004 by marketing and forecasting expert J. Scott Armstrong and political science professors Alfred Cuzán and Randall Jones. The goal at that time was to apply the combination principle in forecasting to predict President Bush's share of the two-party popular vote (omitting minor candidates) in the 2004 presidential election. 
Until Election Day in November of the same year, the researchers collected data from 268 polls, 10 quantitative models, and 246 daily market prices from the Iowa Electronic Markets vote-share market. In each of the last three months prior to the election, they also administered a survey with a panel of 17 experts on US politics, asking them for their predictions. 
The forecasts were first combined within each component method by averaging recent polls, the IEM prediction market forecasts from the previous week, and averaging the predictions of the quantitative models. Then, the researchers averaged the forecasts across the four component methods. The resulting forecast was named the PollyVote. From March to November, the forecasts were initially updated weekly, and then, twice a week. The forecasts were published at the Political Forecasting Special Interest Group at forprin.com.
In 2007, Andreas Graefe joined the PollyVote team and helped to launch the PollyVote.com website prior to the 2008 U.S. presidential election. For predicting the 2008 election, the general structure of the PollyVote remained unchanged; the PollyVote combined forecasts within and across the same four component methods as in 2004. However, some changes were made at the level of the component methods. Instead of averaging recent polls themselves, the PollyVote team used the RCP poll average by RealClearPolitics as the polls component. In addition, the advantage of the leading candidate was discounted (or damped) using the approach suggested by Jim Campbell. The first PollyVote forecast for the 2008 election was published in August 2007, 14 months prior to Election Day, and was updated daily.
For forecasting the 2012 election, a fifth component called "index models" was added to the PollyVote. This component captured information from quantitative models that use a different method and rely on different information than the traditional political economy models. In particular, the index models capture information about the campaign, such as the candidates' perceived issue-handling competence, their leadership skills, their biographies or the influence of other factors such as whether the incumbent government faced some scandal. The first forecast for the 2012 election was published on January 1, 2011, almost two years prior to Election Day. As in 2008, the forecasts were updated daily, or whenever new information became available.
In 2013, the PollyVote was launched in Germany to predict the German federal election of the same year.
Method.
The PollyVote demonstrates the benefits of combining forecasts by averaging predictions within and across several component methods. In its application for the U.S. presidential election, the PollyVote is currently based on five component methods: polls, prediction markets, expert’ judgment, political economy models, and index models. The PollyVote predicts the share of the popular two-party vote achieved by the candidate of the incumbent party.
Accuracy of the PollyVote.
The PollyVote published forecasts prior to each of the three U.S. presidential elections, the 2006 U.S. House of Representatives election, and the 2013 German federal election. In addition, one analysis tested how a the PollyVote would have performed for the three elections from 1992 to 2000. As expected, the application of the forecasting principles has led to accurate forecasts. Surprisingly, however, across the three U.S. Presidential elections, the forecast error was always lower than the error of each component methods. Comparisons have also been made with other methods. For example, forecasts of the 2012 election were also substantially more accurate than the closely watched forecasts from Nate Silver’s model at FiveThirtyEight.com.
2004 U.S. presidential election.
The 2004 PollyVote was launched in March 2004 and forecast a victory for President Bush over the 8 months that it was making forecasts. The final forecast published on the morning of the election predicted that President would receive 51.5% of the popular two-party vote, an error of 0.3 percentage points.
2008 U.S. presidential election.
The 2008 PollyVote was launched in August 2007 and forecast a victory for Barack Obama over the 14 months that it was making daily forecasts. On Election Eve, it predicted that Obama would receive 53.0% of the popular two-party vote, an error of 0.7 percentage points.
2012 U.S. presidential election.
The 2012 PollyVote was launched in January 2011 and forecast a victory for President Obama over the 22 months that it was making daily forecasts. On Election Eve, it predicted that Obama would receive 51.0% of the popular two-party vote, an error of 0.9 percentage points.
2006 US House of Representatives election.
PollyVote predicted the outcome of the 2006 U.S. House of Representatives Elections, forecasting that the Republicans would lose 23 seats, and thus, their majority in the House. The Republicans lost 30 seats and the House majority in those elections.
Perception.
The results of the PollyVote project are regularly published in the academic community. Prior to the past elections, forecasts were published in Foresight – The International Journal of Applied Forecasting and the New Scientist. Analyses of the accuracy of the PollyVote were published in the International Journal of Forecasting and PS: Political Science & Politics. In addition, scholars have referenced the PollyVote as a benchmark when assessing the validity of U.S. presidential election forecasts.
To date, the PollyVote predictions have been rarely cited in the popular press. In their IJF paper, the PollyVote team discusses several reasons why this might be the case: (1) people have difficulties to understand the benefits of combining, (2) people wrongly believe that they can identify the best forecast, and (3) people think that the method of calculating averages is too simple. Another possible reason is that the PollyVote predictions are very stable and rarely change, whereas election observers and journalists are interested in excitement and newsworthiness.

15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze M. 15

The 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze M. 15 was a heavy howitzer used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. Austrian and Czech guns were taken into Wehrmacht service after the Anschluss and the occupation of Czechoslovakia as the 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze 15(t) or (ö).
The M. 15 was adapted from a fortress turret howitzer design to throw the same ammunition as the schwere Feldhaubitze M. 14 some further. It didn't normally breakdown for transport, but could be disassembled into four loads for transport in mountainous areas.
The first five weapons were delivered in the first half of 1916. A total of 57 barrels and 56 carriages were completed by the end of the war.
The Finns purchased twenty weapons after the end of the Winter War. They arrived on the SS "Widor" on 9 October 1940. They were initially issued to Heavy Artillery Battalions 21, 22 and 28. They were unpopular with the field artillery as they were thought to be too heavy and were withdrawn from field duty during the Continuation War. Some went to equip the Maaselkä Fortification Artillery Battalions.

Symphony No. 38 (Haydn)

The Symphony No. 38 in C major, Hoboken I/38, is an early and festive symphony by Joseph Haydn. The symphony was composed some time between 1765 and 1769. Because of the virtuosic oboe parts in the final two movements, its been suggested that the work's composition may have coincided with the employ of the oboist Vittorino Colombazzo in the fall of 1768. The symphony is popularly called the Echo Symphony, a nickname that, like all other named Haydn symphonies, did not originate with the composer.
Nickname (Echo).
It is typically referred to as the "Echo" Symphony because of the use of mimicry motif (or echo) in the cadential phrasing of the second movement. The echo effect is created by scoring the leading line for unmuted first violins and the response from muted second violins.
This innovation in scoring expands upon an earlier common baroque practice of cadential phrase-repetition.
Movements.
The work is scored for two oboes, bassoon, two horns, trumpets, timpani and strings with continuo. There are four movements:
The "Echo" slow movement is scored for strings only.
The trio of the minuet contains a virtuosic solo oboe part that spans the entire range of the instrument and contains leaps of almost two octaves.
The finale is another showpiece for the solo oboe which includes virtuosic display, notes held fermata and a spot for a cadenza. It's not in typical concerto form, but is a mixture between concerto and sonata forms.
Its been suggested that the first two movements were composed before Haydn knew of the engagement with the soloist Colombazzo as they have a completely different character than the two oboe-centric movements that round up the work.

Morphological gradient

In mathematical morphology and digital image processing, a morphological gradient is the difference between the dilation and the erosion of a given image. It is an image where each pixel value (typically non-negative) indicates the contrast intensity in the close neighborhood of that pixel. It is useful for edge detection and segmentation applications.
Mathematical definition and types.
Let formula_1 be a grayscale image, mapping points from a Euclidean space or discrete grid "E" (such as "R"2 or "Z"2) into the real line. Let formula_2 be a grayscale structuring element. Usually, "b" is symmetric and has short-support, e.g., 
Then, the morphological gradient of "f" is given by:
where formula_5 and formula_6 denote the dilation and the erosion, respectively.
An internal gradient is given by:
and an external gradient is given by:
The internal and external gradients are "thinner" than the gradient, but the gradient peaks are located "on" the edges, whereas the internal and external ones are located at each side of the edges. Notice that formula_9.
If formula_10, then all the three gradients have non-negative values at all pixels.

Shamakhi dancers

__NOTOC__
The Shamakhi dancers (Azerbaijani: "Şamaxı rəqqasələri") were the principal dancers of the entertainment groups that existed in Shamakhi (Azerbaijan) up to the late 19th century. These groups worked similarly to tawaifs.
Russian painter Grigory Gagarin who lived in the Caucasus in 1840–1855 depicted the Shamakhi dancers in a series of paintings, in which he referred to them as "bayaderki" (баядерки; sg. "bayaderka" – баядерка; originally the Portuguese term "balliadera" borrowed into Russian and other European languages via French ("bayadère") and initially used to refer to the devadasi.)
The extant documents regarding the Shamakhi dancers, and dances, are very limited. In literature, Shamakhi dancers are referred to in Comte de Gobineau's novel "The dancing girl of Shamakha and other Asiatic tales".
"The Dancer of Shamakha" recounts the life of Armenian dancer Armen Ohanian, her education as a dancer, her childhood in Russia, and her travels in Iran and Egypt. It was published in French as "La Danseuse de Shamakha" in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by Rose Wilder. After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles. She eventually moved to Mexico. She is the author of some 15 publications including autobiographical volumes and books on culture and politics.

Description.
Chiropsoides quadrigatus is a transparent jellyfish with up to 8 flat, white colored white tentacles coming from each of four hand shaped pedalia. Dr. Jamie Seymour suggests that flat tentacles are made for catching fish, while round tentacles are made for catching prawn-like creatures. The jellyfish has a diameter of about 7.9 inches at maturity and possibly larger. Chiropsoides quadrigatus has eight leaf-shaped gonads.
Distribution.
Although the distribution of Chiropsoides quadrigatus is widely debated, the best records suggest that they range in the Indo Pacific Ocean, Western Atlantic, and possibly regions of the Indian Ocean. 
Taxonomy.
Chiropsoides quadrigatus is a nomen dubium species, meaning a species commonly in doubt and debate. Although it best resides in Genus Chiropsoides, a new genus may soon be necessary.
Sting.
Chiropsoides quadrigatus has a vicious sting that is dangerous to all people. The sting can lead to cardiac arrest and is very painful. People are stung in Okinawa every year by these jellyfish which are known as Habu-Kurage in that region.

Marihuana (novel)

Marihuana is a 1941 novella by Cornell Woolrich, published under the pen-name William Irish. The story is about a man who goes on a murder spree after being exposed to marijuana for the first time.
Plot.
King Turner is in a deep funk after his wife, Eleanor, left him. He's fallen in with a pair of reprobates, Bill Evans and Wash Gordon, who are more interested in him as the butt of their jokes than as a friend. One night they drag King and a girl named Vinnie to a "ranch"—a sort of speakeasy where people smoke "grass".
After getting high, King hallucinates that Vinnie is his ex-wife and begins chasing her around the room. Bill hands him a knife as a lark and tells him to "pin her down." King does exactly that and then flees the room. He finds a sleeping bouncer and steals the man's gun. Before he can leave the ranch, a couple police officers arrive, but King manages to sneak past them.
King evades pursuit and hides out in the phone booth of a candy store. While there, a police officer enters and walks towards the store's proprietor to buy a numbers ticket, but King, paranoid from the marijuana, thinks the officer is there to arrest him, and responds by gunning the man down. King flees the store and heads to the hotel where his ex-wife is living.
Eleanor agrees to talk with King in her room. After hearing his story, she tries to calm him down but with little effect. She convinces him to let her order some sandwiches and coffee from room service. On the phone, she tells the clerk that she wants her order fixed "just like the other night," referring to the fact that she'd had sleeping powder added to her coffee to help with insomnia.
But before the order can arrive, King grows paranoid that Eleanor has betrayed him to the police. When he thinks room service is taking too long, King shoots Eleanor and flees the room. With nowhere else to go, he heads back to his apartment, where the police are waiting for him. King escapes onto the ledge of the building. Detective Spillane, the officer in charge of catching him, follows him out, but before he can save him, King jumps to his death.
The book ends with a final twist—back in her apartment Vinnie is alive and well, telling a friend about the gag she, Bill and Wash had pulled on King. Bill had only handed King a butter knife, and when King stabbed her, Vinnie took a ketchup-soaked piece of bread and squeezed it to simulate blood. Vinnie is completely unaware of subsequent events and thinks the whole situation hilarious, though her friend has doubts. The story ends with Detective Spillane arriving and Vinnie's friend thinking, "He's either a bill collector or a plainclothesman ... or maybe a little of both."
Portrayal of Police Officers.
Detective Spillane appears throughout the story as a competent officer who is simply one step behind King, and genuinely wants to help him. However the rest of the police force does not fare so well. When the two officers arrive at the ranch, the proprietor lets them in without making any effort to hide the illicit behavior inside, indicating that the officers are on the take. Likewise, the officer King shoots was attempting to purchase an illegal numbers ticket from the owner of the candy store.
Depiction of Marijuana.
Woolrich's depiction of marijuana is in keeping with popular views of the time which saw the drug as causing "insanity, criminality, and death," according to Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger In his efforts to circumscribe marijuana use, Anslinger disseminated stories based on the trope of "marijuana-crime-insanity", such as allegedly evidenced by the Victor Licata case in which the 21-year-old murdered his family with an axe. (Licata was schizophrenic with homicidal tendencies; there is no evidence that marijuana was a factor in the killings.) 
Inhaling marijuana smoke initially makes King lethargic and he loses all sense of time—something that continues throughout the story as he thinks several days have gone by despite it being the same night; his murder of Eleanor is prompted by his insistence that a half hour has passed since she ordered room service, when in fact it was only five minutes. King and his friends also experience munchies which causes Bill to raid the ranch's kitchen for food; King later notes that "the hempseeds create a false, insatiable appetite." King's lethargy soon turns to hallucinations and paranoia, which causes him to embark upon his murder spree.
Though King and his friends are all middle class, they travel to Hell's Kitchen, an area that had been a center for bootleggers during Prohibition. The "ranch" operates similarly to a speakeasy—the proprietor bribes local police officers, visitors leave their cars several blocks away so as not to draw attention to the ranch, and a bouncer guards the door, inspecting each person through a peephole before letting them enter. Peculiarly, Woolrich has the ranch operate as a buffet, with each visitor paying a cover charge in exchange for an unlimited amount of marijuana.
The term "ranch" is Woolrich's own invention, derived from the slang term for marijuana, "grass." Characters also refer to it as "reefer," though they always describe the joints as cigarettes.
Publication history.
"Marijuana" first appeared in the May 3, 1941 edition of Detective Fiction Weekly. Dell later published it as volume 11 of their 10 Cent Book line. Like the other books of this series, original editions are now collectors' items that can sell for more than $100.

Sin at-tamyiz (the "age of discernment") refers to the age at which a child is able to care for him or herself, no longer requiring adult assistance to eat, dress, or clean themselves. Although it is generally seen as varying individually, Abu Hanifah, founder of the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, states that it is nine years for a girl and seven for a boy. Following divorce, Islamic fiqh generally proscribes that the mother maintains sole custody of a child prior to this age.

The Dark Knight (video game)

The Dark Knight is a cancelled action video game loosely based on the film of the same name. The game was unofficially announced in the summer of 2007 to be developed by Pandemic Studios as an open world Batman game.
The game was confirmed, albeit unofficially, on July 17, 2008 by actor Gary Oldman during an interview with G4's Kristin Adams. In his interview on GameTrailers, Oldman said he knew an awful lot of effort had gone into getting Batman's gliding abilities to feel suitably smooth and fluid for "The Dark Knight" game. Oldman, who reprised his role as Lt. Jim Gordon, did not name a developer in the interview but anonymous sources reported that "The Dark Knight" was a secret project of Pandemic Studios and EA.
Despite prior speculation, no further announcements were made regarding production of the game, even upon the DVD and Blu-ray Disc release of the films on December 9, 2008 in the United States. According to a "Newsweek" article, the lack of a game at the same time of the movie's release may have cost an estimated $101 million in missed revenue. EA and Pandemic Studios had announced that the game would come out on PlayStation 3 console. Pandemic Brisbane, who were responsible for developing this game, has since been shut down and the project cancelled.

<doc id="18585887" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18585887" title="Presidency armies">
Presidency armies

The presidency armies were the armies of the three presidencies of the East India Company's rule in India, later the forces of the British Crown in India. The presidency armies were named after the presidencies: the Bengal Army, the Madras Army and the Bombay Army. Initially, only Europeans served as commissioned or non-commissioned officers. In time, Indian Army units were garrisoned from Peshawar in the north, to Sind in the west, and to Rangoon in the east. The army was engaged in the wars to extend British control in India (the Mysore, Maratha and Sikh wars) and beyond (the Burma, Afghan and Opium wars, and the Expedition to Abyssinia).
The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the Company until the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when the Crown took over the Company and its three armies. In 1895 the three presidency armies were merged into a united Indian Army.
Origin.
The origin of the British Indian Army and subsequently the army of independent India lies in the origins of the Presidency Armies which preceded them. The first purely Indian troops employed by the British were watchmen employed in each of the Presidencies of the British East India Company to protect their trading stations. These were all placed in 1748 under one Commander-in-Chief, Major-General Stringer Lawrence who is regarded as the "Father of the Indian Army".
From the mid-eighteenth century, the East India Company began to maintain armies at each of its three main stations, or Presidencies of British India, at Calcutta (Bengal), Madras and Bombay. The Bengal Army, Madras Army, and Bombay Army were quite distinct, each with its own Regiments and cadre of European officers. All three armies contained European regiments in which both the officers and men were Europeans, as well as a larger number of ‘Native’ regiments, in which the officers were Europeans and the other ranks were Indians. They included Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry regiments, so historical sources refer to the Bengal/Madras/Bombay Artillery/Cavalry/Infantry (the latter often termed ‘Native Infantry’ or ‘N.I.’).
From the mid-eighteenth century onwards, the Crown began to dispatch regiments of the regular British Army to India, to reinforce the Company’s armies. These troops are often referred to as ‘H.M.’s Regiments’ or ‘Royal regiments’.
By 1824, the size of the combined armies of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay was about 200,000 and had at least 170 sepoy and 16 European regiments.
Regimental organisation.
In 1757, Robert Clive came up with the idea of sepoy battalions for the Bengal Presidency, which were to be armed, dressed and trained as the red coats and commanded by a nucleus of British officers. The Madras Army followed suit with six battalions in 1759 followed by the Bombay Army in 1767. Recruitment in all cases was done locally amongst single castes, from specific communities, villages and families. 
Regular cavalry regiments were raised in 1784 of which only three survived the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Irregular cavalry were raised based on the indigenous system of raising cavalry by rulers of Indian states called the "silladar" system. Irregular cavalry regiments had very few British officers. In addition, native artillery and pioneers (referred 
to later as sappers and miners) were also raised.
Between 1796 and 1804, a regimental system on two battalion basis was introduced. The battalions were only theoretically linked together and shared no "esprit-de-corps". The number of British officers went up to 22 per battalion which led to the diminished importance of native officers. The control by the Regimental commander was excessive and exasperating to its battalions and the system was reverted in 1824 with units being formed into single battalion regiments with numbering as per their seniority of raising.
After 1857.
Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the consequent abolition of the East India Company, its European regiments were amalgamated in 1860 with the British Army, but its ‘Native’ regiments were not. The three separate Presidency Armies therefore continued to exist, and their European officers continued to be listed as members of the Bengal, Madras or Bombay Army rather than the British Army. However, the Presidency Armies began to be described collectively as the Indian Army. Another change resulting from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was that henceforward artillery was confined to the British Army. 
In 1895, the separate Presidency Armies were at last abolished and a fully unified Indian Army came into being. As before, its British officers were not members of the British Army, though as young subalterns they did serve for a year with a British Army regiment as part of their training before taking up permanent commissions with their Indian Army regiment.

Felice della Rovere

Felice della Rovere (c. 1483 – September 27, 1536), also known as Madonna Felice, was an illegitimate daughter of Pope Julius II and was one of the most powerful women of the Italian Renaissance. Through the influence of her father, including an arranged marriage to Gian Giordano Orsini, she wielded extraordinary wealth and influence both within and beyond the Roman Curia. In particular, she negotiated a peace between Julius II and the Queen of France.
Della Rovere's mother was Lucrezia Normanni, from an ancient Roman family, for whom Julius II had arranged a marriage to Bernardino de Cupis, a "majordomo" in the della Rovere household. Giovanni Domenico de Cupis, the son of Normanni and de Cupis, was elevated to a cardinal by Leo X. There is limited documentary evidence that della Rovere was married at 14, and was widowed shortly afterward. According to Murphy, della Rovere "de facto" filled "the role that she knew would have been hers had she been born a boy, that of cardinal nipote".
Julius II, who had apparently previously attempted to arrange strategic marriages for his daughter, did not attend her nuptials when she finally consented to marry Gian Giordano Orsini (more than twenty years her senior) at the age of 23. Subsequently, financial records, secondary sources, documents in the Orsini archives, and letters to and from Felice indicate that she exercised considerable influence over not only Julius II, but his Medici successors Pope Leo X and Pope Clement VII, although not the Dutch outsider Pope Adrian VI.
At some point after her marriage, Felice apparently reconciled with her father and received a gift of 9,000 ducats. With these funds, she purchased a castle, Palo, from which she exported wheat with great financial success, often to the Vatican itself.
After the death of Gian Giordano in 1517, Felice gained control of the extensive Orsini financial assets, as the terms of her marriage contract to Orsini had also provided for any future son of hers to take precedence over Napoleone and the other children from Orsini's previous marriage). Felice begot two sons, Francesco and Girolamo, choosing the second as the heir to the Orsini fortune (and thus ensuring a rivalry with Napoleone), as well as two daughters, Giulia and Clarice; another child died during infancy. Following the Sack of Rome (1527), the long-running rivalry between her son Girolamo Orsini and her stepson, Napoleone Orsini, intensified.
Her descendants married into the Sforza, Borghese, and Boncompagni-Ludovisi families.

Bombay Army

The Bombay Army was the army of the Bombay Presidency, one of the three presidencies of the British India within the British Empire.
The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the East India Company until the Government of India Act 1858 (passed in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857) transferred all three presidencies to the direct authority of the British Crown.
In 1895 all three presidency armies were merged into the Indian Army.
History.
The Bombay Army originates from its European Regiment which was formed from independent companies in 1662. The Bombay Army was heavily involved in the defeat of Tipu Sultan of Mysore in 1799 and also took part in later campaigns such as the First Anglo-Afghan War between 1839 and 1842. Only two Bombay Army battalions rebelled during the Indian Mutiny.
In 1895 the three separate Presidency Armies were abolished and the Army of India was divided into four commands, each commanded by a lieutenant-general. These comprised Madras (including Burma), Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal and Bombay (including Aden).
Composition.
Prestigious units of the Bombay Army include the Bombay Grenadiers (now called the Grenadiers) raised in 1784 from grenadier companies of existing regiments, and the Maratha Light Infantry.
Commanders in Chief.

Madras Army

The Madras Army was the army of the Presidency of Madras, one of the three presidencies of the British India within the British Empire.
The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the East India Company until the Government of India Act 1858 (passed in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857) transferred all three presidencies to the direct authority of the British Crown.
In 1903 all three presidency armies were merged into the Indian Army.
Establishment and early history.
The Madras Army of the Honourable East India Company came into being through the need to protect the Company's commercial interests. These were mostly untrained guards, with only some bearing arms. The French attack and capture of Madras in 1746 forced the British hand. In 1757, a hundred years before Mangal Pandey came on the scene, the British decided to raise well-trained military units to conduct operations, conquer territory, and force allegiance from local rulers. 
The loosely organised military units were later combined into battalions with Indian officers commanding local troops. One of the first major actions fought by these troops was in the battle of Wandiwash in 1760. The troops were highly praised for their steadiness under fire. Earlier a good part of the force was sent to Bengal under young Clive, who made history and a personal fortune after the Battle of Plassey.
The Madras Army officers were in the early years very conscious of the soldiers' local customs, caste rituals, dress, and social hierarchy. Some leading landowners joined the Madras Army, one of whom is recorded as Mootoo (Muthu) Nayak from the nobility in Madura. As the army expanded and new officers came in, mostly from Company sources, the leadership style and care of the men changed for the worse. The most famous incident in the Madras Army was the Vellore mutiny. Looting was an organised activity among the East India Company officers. Lord Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was in the Seringapatnam battle. In keeping with the times, he laid down the share of every officer and sepoy from the loot that was organised after Tipu was killed. The defeat of Hyder Ali and the death of Tipu with the most widespread looting of Seringapatnam rankled with Indians at all levels. After Tipu Sultan was killed, his two sons were held in British custody in Vellore Fort.
In the 1830s the Madras Army was concerned with internal security and support for the civil administration. This was a multi-ethnic army in which the British officers were encouraged to learn and speak Asian languages. In 1832-1833 the Madras Army put down a rebellion in the Visakhapatnam district: the superior discipline and training of the Madras Army produced a victory for them.
Under the British Raj.
Post-1857 history.
The Army of the Madras Presidency remained almost unaffected by the Indian Rebellion of 1857. By contrast with the larger Bengal Army where all but twelve (out of eighty-four) infantry and cavalry regiments either mutinied or were disbanded, all fifty-two regiments of Madras Native Infantry remained loyal and passed into the new Indian Army when direct British Crown rule replaced that of the Honourable East India Company. Four regiments of Madras Light Cavalry and the Madras Artillery batteries did however disappear in the post-Mutiny reorganisation of all three of the Presidency Armies. The Madras Fusiliers (a regiment of European infantry recruited by the East India Company for service in India) was transferred to the regular British Army.
End of the separate Madras Army.
In 1895 the three separate Presidency Armies were abolished and the Army of India was divided into four commands, each commanded by a lieutenant-general. These comprised Madras (including Burma), Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal and Bombay (including Aden).
Disbanding of Madras infantry regiments.
While the Madras Army remained in existence as a separate entity until 1895, twelve of the Madras Native Infantry regiments were disbanded between 1862 and 1864. A further eight went in 1882, three between 1902 and 1904, two in 1907 and four in 1922. The remainder were disbanded between 1923 and 1933, leaving the highly regarded Madras Sappers and Miners as the only Madrasi unit in the Indian Army until a new Madras Regiment was raised in 1942, during World War II. Both of these regiments continue to exist in the modern Indian Army.
The gradual phasing out of Madrasi recruitment for the Indian Army in the late 19th century, in favour of Sikhs, Rajputs, Dogras and Punjabi Mussalmans, was justified by General Sir Frederick Roberts on the grounds that long periods of peace and inactivity in Southern India had rendered the Madras infantry soldier inferior to the Martial Races of the North. The military historians John Keegan and Philip Mason have however pointed out that under the "watertight" Presidency Army system, Madras regiments had little opportunity of active service on the North-West Frontier. As a result the more ambitious and capable British officers of the Indian Army opted for service with Punjabi and other northern units and the overall efficiency of the Madras Army suffered accordingly.

1798 – The First Year of Liberty

1798 – The First Year of Liberty is an album of traditional Irish songs relating to the 1798 rebellion by the United Irishmen. All songs are sung by Frank Harte and some are accompanied on bouzouki, guitar and occasional bodhrán by Donal Lunny. 
The album was released in 1998 to commemorate the bicentenary of the events and is accompanied by a detailed booklet about the rebellion and each of the songs on the album.
'The booklet, as well as containing a concise account of the rising, has biographies of all the leaders of the 1798 rebellion, and a handsome cover illustration. It has a substantial bibliography for those seeking further enlightenment, and it makes a useful complement to the more orthodox histories thereby listed. In fact, it tells us what orthodox histories do not tell us; what those who suffered made of the events of 1798.'

Alfred Prunier

Alfred Prunier (1848, in Yerville, France – 1925) was a French chef and restaurant owner.
In 1872, Prunier and his wife, Catherine, opened a Parisian restaurant that bore his name in the French capital (today the restaurant operates under the name "Goumard.") His restaurant, specialized in seafood and grilled entrées. The quality of the cuisine, the service, and the interior decor quickly made the restaurant a success. Famous writers such as Oscar Wilde, actors such as Sarah Bernhardt, politicians such as Clemenceau, and aristocrats including Russian royalty were regularly seen there.
Prunier's son, Émile, opened another Prunier restaurant on the avenue Victor Hugo in Paris in 1924, which attracted writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. After his death in 1925, his daughter, Simone, took up the business and opened a third restaurant in London. The second restaurant still operates, but the London restaurant closed in 1976.

<doc id="18586131" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18586131" title="Co-training">
Co-training

Co-training is a machine learning algorithm used when there are only small amounts of labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data. One of its uses is in text mining for search engines. It was introduced by Avrim Blum and Tom Mitchell in 1998.
Algorithm design.
Co-training is a semi-supervised learning technique that requires two "views" of the data. It assumes that each example is described using two different feature sets that provide different, complementary information about the instance. Ideally, the two views are conditionally independent (i.e., the two feature sets of each instance are conditionally independent given the class) and each view is sufficient (i.e., the class of an instance can be accurately predicted from each view alone). Co-training first learns a separate classifier for each view using any labeled examples. The most confident predictions of each classifier on the unlabeled data are then used to iteratively construct additional labeled training data.
The original co-training paper described experiments using co-training to classify web pages into "academic course home page" or not; the classifier correctly categorized 95% of 788 web pages with only 12 labeled web pages as examples. The paper has been cited over 1000 times, and received the 10 years Best Paper Award at the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2008), a renowned computer science conference.
Krogel and Scheffer showed in 2004 that co-training is only beneficial if the data sets used in classification are independent. Co-training can only work if one of the classifiers correctly labels a piece of data that the other classifier previously misclassified. If both classifiers agree on all the unlabeled data, i.e. they are not independent, labeling the data does not create new information. When they applied co-training to problems in functional genomics, co-training worsened the results as the dependence of the classifiers was greater than 60%.
Uses.
Co-training has been used to classify web pages using the text on the page as one view and the anchor text of hyperlinks on other pages that point to the page as the other view. Simply put, the text in a hyperlink on one page can give information about the page it links to. Co-training can work on "unlabeled" text that has not already been classified or tagged, which is typical for the text appearing on web pages and in emails. According to Tom Mitchell, "The features that describe a page are the words on the page and the links that point to that page. The co-training models utilize both classifiers to determine the likelihood that a page will contain data relevant to the search criteria." Text on websites can judge the relevance of link classifiers, hence the term "co-training". Mitchell claims that other search algorithms are 86% accurate, whereas co-training is 96% accurate.
Co-training was used on FlipDog.com, a job search site, and by the U.S. Department of Labor, for a directory of continuing and distance education. It has been used in many other applications, including statistical parsing and visual detection.

1979: Shortly after the Iranian Revolution, Iraqi vice president Saddam Hussein fears the increasing influence of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, as well as Iraqi president Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr's proposed union with Syria. Saddam instigates the overthrow of President al-Bakr. After being appointed president, Saddam orders his half-brother, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, to initiate a bloody purge of the Ba'ath Party leadership in order to wipe out "traitors". Saddam himself executes his closest friend and ally, Adnan Hamdani, as a show of strength. The Islamic Dawa Party rocks Baghdad with a series of terrorist attacks while Saddam is on a hunting trip in Tikrit with his wife Sajida Talfah and son Uday.
Saddam attempts to maintain good relations with the United States as he declares war on Iran. Meanwhile, he begins an affair with married school teacher Samira Shahbandar. Saddam orders the execution of two Iraqi generals after a military defeat at Khorramshahr, and turns against Barzan following the death of their mother; this puts the arranged marriage of Raghad, Saddam's daughter, and Mohammed, Barzan's son, in jeopardy. After Saddam survives an assassination attempt in the Dawa stronghold of Dujail, Barzan fears for his own life and razes the city in retribution. Saddam exiles Barzan to Switzerland and marries Raghad to Hussein Kamel al-Majid, forming an alliance with the al-Majid clan. Hussein Kamel takes over Barzan's post and becomes the new leader of the Special Republican Guard.
Part II.
1988: As the war with Iran ends, an unstable Uday fires a gun in a Baghdad nightclub. Meanwhile, Saddam declares victory over Iran, even though Iraq has suffered heavy losses and is facing bankruptcy; the Iraqi economy is also being hampered by Kuwait, which is over-producing oil and driving down its price. Sajida learns that Saddam has married Samira as a second wife, and blames his trusted valet, Kamel Hana Gegeo, for assisting their affair. Uday almost kills the valet for the sake of his mother's honour, sparing him only so that he can control him when he succeeds his father. Hussein Kamel attempts to rise within the regime's inner circle by sowing mistrust between Saddam and Adnan. Saddam's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, travels to an OPEC meeting in Geneva and reveals that Kuwait has been slant drilling into Iraqi oil fields, demanding that the Kuwaitis cease. 
Saddam's new marriage to Samira leaves Uday fearful that the couple's presumptive children will jeopardize his status as Saddam's heir. Uday confronts Kamel Hana at a late-night party and beats him to death to the horror of witnesses. After having Uday arrested, Saddam nearly kills his first-born son in his cell. Adnan questions Uday's abilities as Iraq's future leader, but is not supported by Hussein Kamel, who continues to gain Saddam's trust. Not long after, Adnan is killed in a suspicious helicopter explosion. Sajida confronts Saddam about her brother's death, but he dismisses her with claims that it was merely an accident. 
1990-1991: Saddam meets with April Glaspie, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and takes her statement of "no opinion" as giving him tacit approval to invade Kuwait. However, President George H.W. Bush immediately decries the action and organizes an international coalition to drive out Saddam's forces. Saddam refuses to back down, and is forced to move between safe-houses as the First Gulf War commences with the U.S.-led bombing of Baghdad. The Iraqi Army is quickly forced into retreat as the coalition unleashes its ground offensive. However, the U.S. declares a ceasefire and withdraws from the Iraqi border, leaving Saddam defiant.
Part III.
1995: The Gulf War has left Iraq economically crippled. The United Nations refuses to lift sanctions unless the government agrees to dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Saddam states he has nothing to hide, resulting in a stand-off between him and the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector, Rolf Ekeus. Saddam is more preoccupied with tracing his roots than with the U.N. stand-off, and ignores his other son, Qusay, when he tries to warn his father about Uday's erratic behaviour. Instead, Saddam presents a family tree purportedly proving a familial relation to the prophet Muhammad. Qusay is clearly worried about his father's state of mind, but quietly leaves him to his devices. 
The rivalry between General Hussein Kamel and Uday spirals out of control, as the heir apparent pelts the general with food at a dinner with Saddam's closest allies. The frustrated Hussein Kamel states his disillusionment with Saddam's regime, which allows the spoiled Uday to run wild with impunity. His patience finally ends when Uday hijacks a shipment of medical supplies intended for Hussein Kamel's brother, Saddam Kamel. The brothers discuss Hussein Kamel's plan to cooperate with Ekeus and the CIA, hoping that he will be installed as Iraq's new president after Saddam is overthrown.
During a holiday celebrating Iraq's "victory" over Iran, the Kamel brothers cross the border to Jordan with their wives, Raghad and Rana Hussein. The women, Saddam's daughters, warn their husbands of the potential consequences should Saddam discover their absences. Meanwhile, at a holiday party, Uday rapes a waitress. Qusay realises that his sisters are missing and notifies Saddam. In Jordan, King Hussein grants the self-exiled group asylum just as Saddam declares them traitors in Iraq. 
Hussein Kamel plans to oust Saddam with Western support, and to reveal state secrets once installed as president. His plans are undermined when Saddam decides to reveal the information himself. Kamel becomes increasingly isolated in Jordan, and begins to lose the support of the king and the CIA. Saddam has Sajida to talk their daughters into coming back to Iraq, promising her that they will be safe upon their return. He also offers a pardon to the Kamel brothers. Believing he will be forgiven, and disturbed by his increasing loss of social status, Hussein Kamel and the others return despite warnings from Raghad and Rana. 
Once they return to Baghdad, Hussein and Saddam Kamel are humiliated by Uday and Qusay, who force them to divorce their wives and strip them of their Iraqi uniforms and ranks. However, they allow them to return to their family home, while Raghad and Rana go to their mother's house. Saddam Hussein then tells General Ali Hassan al-Majid that the honor of the al-Majid clan will be tainted as long as the pair go unpunished. Ali subsequently surrounds the brothers' house with troops, offering the brothers weapons so that they can die fighting. In a pitched battle, Hussein and Saddam Kamel are killed.
Part IV.
2003: Saddam, along with Uday, Qusay and Aziz, watch television reports of the unfolding Second Gulf War. Qusay seizes Saddam's money from the Central Bank of Iraq on his father's orders. Meanwhile, Saddam orders his troops, particularly those from the Special Republican Guard, to fiercely resist the U.S.-led coalition forces. During a meeting with his sons in a Baghdad restaurant, Saddam advises Qusay to take care of Uday, who is commanding the Fedayeen Saddam paramilitary force. 
On 9 April, Saddam is forced from power as U.S. forces take over Baghdad. As U.S. troops begin manhunts for high-ranking regime members, Saddam flees to rural Tikrit and goes underground with his loyal confidants. He phones Samira from a call box and tells her to leave for Lebanon. Saddam hides out in a rustic building with his remaining bodyguards. He befriends Ahmed, a lively local boy who initially does not know his identity. Saddam broadcasts messages from his hideout insisting that the Iraqi people continue to resist the U.S. occupation. Meanwhile, Sajida and her family anxiously watch news coverage of the war.
Uday, Qusay and Qusay's son Mustapha take refuge at a house in Mosul. Uday wishes to flee, but Qusay contemptuously refuses. Saddam is informed that there is a monetary reward for his family's betrayal, but he insists that they will not be caught. However, the owner of Uday and Qusay's safehouse betrays them to the Americans, and the 101st Airborne Division surround the building. After refusing to give themselves up, and exchanging fire with the troops, the Americans fire a rocket at their position and all three are killed. Sajida is distressed to learns of her sons' deaths from TV news.
After being informed of the deaths, Saddam secretly visits the graves of his sons and grandson, laying Iraqi flags on them. He continues trying to rally the Iraqi people against U.S. forces, saying that his fallen sons are heroes of "jihad". Saddam's bodyguards build a tunnel where the former dictator can hide, but one of them is captured by U.S. troops when he visits his girlfriend. Saddam decides to move elsewhere, but Ahmed warns him of U.S. patrols. He offers to hide Saddam, but the former president refuses to involve him. In Operation Red Dawn, Saddam is captured and taken into custody.
2006: Saddam is placed on trial for crimes against humanity and is sentenced to death by hanging for the Dujail Massacre.
Reception.
Reviews.
The first episode was very widely reviewed in the UK. "The Independent" newspaper described the drama as ""The Sopranos" with Scud missiles", adding that it was good entertainment but that it seemed to gloss over early US and British support for Saddam's regime. Nancy Banks Smith of "The Guardian" also compared it to "The Sopranos" ("without the jokes"), but judged it to be "an extraordinarily ambitious attempt and it succeeds very well". Tim Teeman in "The Times" described it as "convincing and chilling... It was soap (the feeling of "Dallas" was heightened by the late-1970s/early-1980s tacky glam: check out Saddam's glass lift), it was reality, it was cheeky and it was terrifying." Serena Davis of "The Daily Telegraph" objected to some "clunking" expository dialogue explaining political events, but was impressed that "Naor's towering version of the dictator envisioned him as both adept family schemer and political giant."
Ratings.
United States.

Stream Cliff Farm

Stream Cliff Farm, also called the Stream Cliff Herb Farms, is a historic farm located in southern Jennings County, Indiana, USA, near the village of Commiskey. It was visited by John Hunt Morgan during his cavalry march through Indiana on July 11, 1863. , it is the oldest herb farm in Indiana. It opens from April to December.
James Harmon came to the land in 1821, as it was a land grant owed to his father due to his service in the American Revolutionary War some forty years prior. The brick farmhouse on the property was built in the 1820s or 1830s, and is still used as the family's residence; its builder made the brick for the house himself. The main body of John Hunt Morgan's forces traveled by the farm on July 11, 1863. Afterwards, before 1863 was over, Harmon died and his property went to a local Methodist church. It was from this church that the farm was passed down through five generations to the current owner and her husband. Indiana's John Hunt Morgan Heritage Trail passes by the farm on its west side. The classroom building on the property was built in 1868 to house railroad workers.
The farm has been in the same family for five generations, sometimes passing down the female line. The current owner Betty Manning, whose great-grandfather bought the property, and her husband opened Stream Cliff Farm for visitors for nearly 35 years. Originally, it only sold "handmade crafts", but later switched to focus on herbs and perennials.
Among the facilities at Stream Cliff Farm are a winery, three arts and crafts shops, and a general store. The winery first opened in 2007, and calls its tasting room General Morgan's Tasting Room, after John Hunt Morgan. The impetus to open the winery was due to the owner's husband being told to drink red wine by his cardiologist. There is also a garden for visitors to stroll through. A small restaurant at the place, called the Twigs & Sprigs Tearoom, is a tearoom uses the herbs and edible flowers grown at the farm in each entree, and specializes in soups and sandwiches.

The Black Swan (1954 book)

The Black Swan (in German, "Die Betrogene: Erzählung") is a German novella written by Thomas Mann, first published in 1954.
A period work, it takes place in Düsseldorf, Germany, in the late 1920s.
Plot summary.
Rosalie, a 50 year old widow, finds her youthful manner diminished by the "organic phenomena of her time of life," or menopause. She lives with her adult, but unmarried, daughter and an adolescent son all of who juxtapose youth and her "superannuated" purpose in life.
The family hires a young, American-born man to tutor for her son. Rosalie is strongly attracted to him and is soon infatuated. Her abnegating daughter disapproves more strongly now of her still socializing mother. Then, seemingly miraculously, Rosalie's menopause reverses. Where her vitality, and sexual awareness would be in decline, she is in a heightened state of sexual awareness including the return of menstrual bleeding.
Rosalie plans a family trip and declares her intentions and availability to the young man. They plan a liaison in the Rhine castle "Schloss Benrath", but it never takes place, however. She is found dead of a hemorrhage caused by a metastatic tumor in her uterus.
The surgeons' commentary include a discussion on the possible causes of Rosalie's newfound youth. Cancer was an obvious cause of her tumor, but one doctor supposes that it could have been the yearning for love and her altered or re-awakened erotic personality that stimulated her ovaries thereby causing the cancerous growth.
Themes.
Thomas Mann was 78 years old when he wrote the novella. The setting for the story and Europe in transition after the First World War creates the old-fashioned and modern age comparisons which are developed strongly in the characters of Rosalie's family. The graphic descriptions in female biology, symbolic and overt sexuality and death create a dark picture for life's twilight. He revisits mortality and like Death in Venice, of 1912, comments on societal attitudes and age. As in that work, Rosalie dies before any interest is consummated.
Cultural Impact.
It stands as one of the first works to bring hard medicine into popular culture.

NGC 3190

NGC 3190 is a spiral galaxy with tightly wound arms and lying in the constellation Leo. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 3190 is member of Hickson 44 galaxy group, estimated at around 80 million light years away, and consisting of four galaxies in a tight group - NGC 3193 is fairly featureless, NGC 3187 is a dim but striking spiral galaxy and NGC 3185 has a barred spiral structure with an outer ring.
In 2002 two supernovae were observed in the galaxy. A Brazilian amateur astronomer Paulo Cacella detected one supernova in the southeastern part in March 2002 (SN 2002bo), and then an Italian team, while studying the first one, detected a second supernova (SN 2002cv) on the other side two months later.
In 2012 Apple Inc used a blue tinted image of NGC 3190 as their desktop image for their release of OS X Mountain Lion.

Carnett's sign

In medicine, Carnett's sign is a finding on clinical examination in which (acute) abdominal pain remains unchanged or increases when the muscles of the abdominal wall are tensed. For this part of the abdominal examination, the patient can be asked to lift the head and shoulders from the examination table to tense the abdominal muscles. An alternative is to ask the patient to raise both legs with straight knees.
A positive test increases the likelihood that the abdominal wall and not the abdominal cavity is the source of the pain (for example, due to rectus sheath hematoma instead of appendicitis). A negative Carnett's sign is said to occur when the abdominal pain decreases when the patient is asked to lift the head; this points to an intra-abdominal cause of the pain.
History.
This test was first described by John B. Carnett in 1926. The first clear description of anterior abdominal wall pain arising from structures other than the underlying viscera was Cyriax in 1919. Cyriax considered that pain could be mimicked by lesions that arose from the vertebra, ribs or other associated structure or that they were the result of direct irritation of intercostal nerves. By identifying conditions such as alterations in the normal vertebral curves, minor subluxation of vertebral bodies and pressure on the peripheral portions of the intercostal nerves, he was able to employ various mechanical treatments to correct the abnormalities and relieve his patients’ symptoms. Despite this paper little attention was paid to this problem until Carnett developed his simple clinical test. Carnett thought that lower abdominal pain was commonly caused by the lower six thoracic nerves and wanted to be able to distinguish this origin from that arising from the viscera.
Differential diagnosis.
The differential diagnosis of a positive Carnett's test includes hernias, nerve entrapment syndrome, irritation of intercostal nerve roots, anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment, rib-tip syndrome, myofascial pain, trigger points and rectus sheath hematomas. 
All abdominal wall hernias may be associated with pain and Carnett's test may be useful in their evaluation. The hernias of the anterior abdominal wall include: epigastric hernias, umbilical hernias, spigelian hernias and incisional hernias. Those of the groin include: direct inguinal hernia, indirect inguinal hernia, femoral hernia and sports hernia. Those of the pelvic wall include: sciatic hernia, obturator hernia and perineal hernia. The support hernias include: vault prolapse, enterocele, cystocele, rectocele and uterine decensus. Although most hernias can be detected clinically with the presence of a lump with an expansile cough impulse some may be difficult to detect either because they are small or because the patient is obese. In cases where the diagnosis is suspected but clinically unconfirmed, additional investigation using radiography or ultrasonography may be helpful. Herniography, in which contrast medium is introduced into the peritoneal cavity, has been successfully used to reveal previously unsuspected inguinal hernias in patients with groin pain of uncertain origin and to detect impalpable interparietal lesions such as Spigelian hernias.
Rib tip syndrome is characterized by pain along the costal margin and is caused by hypermobility of the eighth, ninth and tenth ribs. These ribs do not articulate with the sternum but instead are bound to each other by a thin band of fibrous tissue. If this fibrous attachment becomes divided, the rib(s) may ride up and irritate the intercostal nerve(s) causing pain. Clinically the patient may be aware of a snapping or clicking sensation as the ribs move relative to one another. The clinician can reproduce the symptoms by hooking his or her fingers under the costal margin and pulling upwards. Relief can be provided by anesthetizing the relevant intercostal nerve with local anesthetic. If symptoms persist, rib tip resection may be necessary.
Spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma arises from rupture of the epigastric vessels. The patient usually presents with a sudden well-localized abdominal pain associated with a tender nonpulsatile abdominal mass, usually in the lower abdomen. There is frequently a plausible precipitating factor such as local trauma, a bout of coughing or anticoagulant therapy. The diagnosis can be confirmed on ultrasound examination and a conservative approach to treatment can be adopted provided that the hematoma does not enlarge. Carnett's test may be diagnostic in this setting.

Komuz languages

Nilo-Saharan specialists have vacillated on a genealogical relationship between the Koman and Gumuz languages of Ethiopia and (South) Sudan, a relationship called Komuz. Greenberg (1963) had included Gumuz in the Koman language family. Bender (1989, 1991) classified them together in a distant relationship he called Komuz, but by 1996 he had reversed himself, though he kept both groups in core Nilo-Saharan. Dimmendaal (2008) kept them together, though expressed doubts over whether they belonged in Nilo-Saharan, later referring to Gumuz as an isolate (2011). Ahland (2010, 2012), on the basis of new Gumuz data, resurrected the hypothesis. Blench (2010) independently came to the same conclusion and suggested that the Shabo language might be a third, outlying branch. The classification of Shabo is difficult because of a strong Koman influence on the language that is independent of any genealogical relationship between them. Schnoebelen (2009), however, sees Shabo as a likely isolate.
Languages.
Shabo is included per Blench (2010).

Desire in the Dust

Desire in the Dust is a 1960 film made by 20th Century Fox, directed by William F. Claxton, and produced by Robert L. Lippert. The film stars Raymond Burr, Martha Hyer and Joan Bennett. The screenplay was written by Charles Lang, based on a novel by Harry Whittington.
Plot.
Lonnie Wilson (Ken Scott), the son of a sharecropper, Zuba Wilson (Douglas Fowley), returns to his small southern hometown of Clinton, Louisiana after spending six years on the chain-gang for killing Colonel Ben Marquand's son, Davey, in an automobile accident. He revives his love affair with Melinda Marquand (Martha Hyer), who is now Mrs. Melinda Thomas, having married Dr. Ned Thomas (Brett Halsey) while Lonnie was serving time in her place for the accident she caused.
Somewhat miffed about all this, Lonnie incites Dr. Ned about his wife's infidelity, which Dr. Ned verifies when he catches Lonnie and Melinda in a semi-torrid embrace in Colonel Marquand's hunting lodge. Melinda, looking for an explanation, shoots and wounds Lonnie to defend her innocence by claiming she was being raped.
Colonel Marquand (Raymond Burr), who had bribed Lonnie to take the blame for his daughter, uses her story to have Sheriff Wheaton (Kelly Thordsen) kill Lonnie, thereby putting an end to all this mess. Mrs. Marquand (Joan Bennett) eventually faces Davey's death and realizes that she witnessed Melinda run down her little brother.
Peter Marquand (Jack Ging) and Ned return to the lodge and inform Otis that the charges against Lonnie are all lies. Exonerated, Lonnie gives Zuba the deed to the farm, and the old man dances in delight, thrilled to finally own his land.
Production.
Raymond Burr was already three years into "Perry Mason" when he decided to return to his movie-villain roots with "Desire in the Dust".

On the Other Hand, Death

On the Other Hand, Death is a 2008 gay-themed mystery film. It is the third film adaptation of a Richard Stevenson novel featuring fictional detective Donald Strachey. The film was screened at several LGBT film festivals, including the New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Film Festival, 2008 before going into rotation on the here! television network.
Plot.
Private Investigator Donald Strachey is under the impression he is tailing an unfaithful housewife for evidence that she is cheating on her husband, but it turns out that the "housewife" is actually an undercover cop who promptly arrests him. After six hours of questioning the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife. Most of the info on file at Strachey Investigations about this mystery client is fake. Meanwhile, at the home of Dorothy 'Dot' Fisher and her partner Edith Strong, Dorothy chases out a vandal after he breaks into their home and spray paints homophobic graffiti on their wall. The next day, Andrew McWhirter, close friend of Fisher and Strong—and Timmy Callhan's former boyfriend—introduce Donald and Timmy to the lesbian couple after a contentious school board meeting at which Dorothy, a guidance counselor at the school, is placed on paid leave due to objections from a homophobic parent whose gay son Derek has been counseled by Fisher. The two are invited by the middle-aged women and houseguest Andrew back to their home in Hollis, but the socialization is interrupted when the returning vandal throws a brick through the window. Strachey chases him back to his car, but the license plate is obscured by mud.
The following day, Kenny gives Don pictures he obtained of the mysterious "client", and his e-mail address, the one piece of info he offered about himself that is at least a marginal lead. With no other pressing cases, Strachey returns to Hollis, investigating motives for the vandalism. Dorothy suspects the homophobic Joey Deems, who attends the school he works at, but his father Carl tells Donald that he believes the motive is more likely a resentful backlash against Fisher's decision not to sell her house to Millipond Realty, who wants to build a large mall along Moon Road, the street the Deems, Dot & Edith, and other residents, who all received offers on their properties, live on.
Strachey manages to discover a connection between Millipond and Colter Investigations, a rival P.I. firm. That night, after an abortive attempt by Andrew to seduce Donald, close to the Fisher home, a fire breaks out inside their barn. Upon investigation, Donald also discovers a body in the barn, which later turns out to be that of Leo Colter, the head of the aforementioned P.I. firm. Strachey sneaks into the Colter offices and purloins some sensitive files. Later, he exchanges the faux client's e-mail address for a copy of the autopsy report on Colter's body, courtesy of Bailey.
In Hollis, a distraught Derek visits Dorothy in a desperate plea for help, but his father Jonas arrives, and informs Fisher she can now expect to have her position with the school fully terminated. Donald discusses the results of the autopsy report with Dorothy and warns her that he suspects foul play, and that Dorothy may have to contend with even more than the loss of her job and the barrage of vandalism and arson. Strachey's visit is cut short by a call from Kenny, who has been tailing Santer as part of his field experience requirements. He discovers that Santer has been having coffee with the same mysterious "client" that hired Donald to track her under false pretenses. Donald returns to Albany in time to observe both participants in the coffee date going their separate ways. Kenny manages to stick with Santer, but Strachey's attempts to tail the mystery man are derailed by one of his former disgruntled clients. Coming up with a Plan B, Donald joins Kenny at Sturgis Development, which was Santer's destination. She is working undercover, investigating allegations of fraud. She tells him his mystery client's name—Peter Garritty, who is also in the real estate business.
Sensing that things aren't adding up, Donald interrupts a lunch date between Tim and his former flame, outright accusing Andrew of being involved in the shady dealings he's uncovered. A defensive McWhirter denies knowing Garritty, and shoots back that Donald is still pissed for the pass Andrew made earlier. Tim, who was unaware of the incident until now, runs out of his office, but Donald assures him that the attraction—and "action" the previous night—weren't mutual, and that he doesn't even trust McWhirter, let alone like him.
Back in Hollis, Strachey presses Dorothy on the lack of records about "Edith Strong" before 1972. Later, Strachey talks to "Edith" alone; she breaks down and confesses the details of her past to him. Her birth name was Laura Whitaker. As a young woman, she, like Dorothy, was an activist. During an attempt to protest the Vietnam War, a planned bombing of an empty courthouse went terribly wrong, accidentally killing a close friend of Laura's. Furthermore, Edith/Laura knows that Joey Deems has been vandalizing her and Dorothy's home—because she asked him to do it. Not too long ago, a man called her and threatened to expose her to the police and Dorothy if she failed to convince her stubborn partner to sell their home. Later, Edith finds out that Dorothy has already known about her past as Laura for some time now, and it changed nothing as far as Dot's feelings for her or their relationship was concerned. Dot suddenly yells for help, letting Strachey know that Andrew has apparently been kidnapped, as per a video clip e-mailed to her showing him being held hostage and ending with a demand for a $500,000 ransom. Strachey, with Santer's assistance, arranges for Sturgis to buy out Dot and Edith's home at the steeply overvalued price of half a million dollars, which would enable the couple to meet the ransom demand.
Strachey then breaks into Garritty's office, uncovering a much broader conspiracy that is appearing to link all the players he has met so far in some way, one centered on various parties outmaneuvering each other until the winner is able to cash in on the lucrative deal to sell all the properties along Moon Road—a deal worth a total of $40 million—but his research is interrupted by Garritty's arrival. Strachey surprises Garritty and persuades him to answer many of his questions, but this is also interrupted—by gunshots fired by an unknown assailant. Garritty uses the distraction to evade further interrogation by the P.I.
After another session with Carl Deems in which he is more forthcoming about his frustration with Fisher's resistance to the Moon Road real estate deal, blocking his ambition to sell his own property, Donald discovers Carl's clearly closeted son Joey being intimate with his openly gay classmate Derek. Joey confesses to vandalizing Dorothy's house, but truthfully denies being involved with the later fire, let alone Colter's murder.
Game time arrives. As the midnight deadline for the ransom money approaches, Santer arrives at Dot and Edith's place with the money in cash, courtesy of Sturgis. Strachey catches Santer off guard, tricking her into admitting (with a nearby Garritty listening) that she plans to cut him out the profitable real estate deal. Garritty emerges from hiding amongst the bushes, objecting to the ad hoc ruse, after which Santer reveals herself as an undercover cop. Strachey then confronts her with his knowledge of her attempt on Garritty's life hours earlier, as well as her murdering of Colter. The P.I. then exposes Andrew's collusion with Garritty as well, having unearthed that the kidnapping was entirely staged, leading McWhirter, who is also hiding nearby, to show himself. The greedy Santer and Garritty, both armed, shoot each other, leaving McWhirter to take the cash. Strachey chases him into the barn and confronts him for hurting Dot and Edith—he was the mystery blackmailer. McWhirter gets the drop on Strachey and is about to shoot him, but Dot is close by, and hits him from behind with a softball bat.
The next day Donald finally breaks through to Jonas by showing him autopsy pictures of teen suicides, warning him that Derek could wind up the same way without his help. Strachey gives him a card for The Trevor Project, which Jonas rejected as a recruiting tool for homosexuals when Dot referred Derek to it earlier, but now accepts as a valid source of psychological assistance, leading him and his son to reconcile and likely avoiding the fate Donald warned of. Back home, as Donald and Tim put this latest case behind them, they discuss Dot's reinstatement to her position at the school and a plea bargain that should make it so the worst Edith will have to endure is a year of house arrest, which she will get through fine with Dot by her side.
Continuity.
The setting for much of this film, Hollis, is a fictional town presumably located 20–25 miles from Albany. In the original novel the movie was adapted from, Moon Road was located in West Albany (which is not actually part of Albany proper). Hollis is meant to be a modern-day rural town that is meant to hold onto the conservative social conditions (which would have been found in the mid-1990s), combined with the sense of declining population and industry actually found in reality in West Albany which was ripe for the investment deal that made up the bulk of the premise the story's plot hinges on.

Sign of the Cross (novel)

Sign of the Cross was the second novel by "New York Times" bestselling author Chris Kuzneski. First published in October 2006 by Penguin Group (USA), the religious thriller followed the exploits of Jonathon Payne and David Jones, who have been featured in all of Kuzneski's thrillers. It also introduced the character of Nick Dial, who has appeared in every Kuzneski novel since.
The book was endorsed by several notable authors, including Clive Cussler, Nelson DeMille, Steve Berry, James Rollins, and Tess Gerritsen.
Penguin UK released the British version in April 2007, and the book climbed to #11 on the British bestseller list. The foreign rights to "Sign of the Cross" have sold in more than fifteen languages.
Plot summary.
Jonathon Payne and David "D.J." Jones are recruited to find Dr. Charles Boyd, an archeologist who recently found the Catacombs of Orvieto, the safe haven for the popes of the Middle Ages. While Boyd avoids pursuit, a series of victims turn up dead, people who were tortured and crucified like Jesus Christ on his final day. All the incidents are interconnected, but it’s up to Payne and Jones to figure out the common thread and why they were selected to solve the puzzle.
Book Reviews.
From "Publishers Weekly" — “Kuzneski knows what fans of the genre want: compelling and well-researched history, high-tech 21st-century sleuthing, and a lot of action.”
From Crime Squad (United Kingdom) — “In "Sign of the Cross", Chris Kuzneski has created an entirely original world-view and tells us an extraordinary tale with one hell of a sting to it. He writes like a dream and his thriller style is nigh on flawless. Indeed, the author has created a page-turning style that older thriller pros would give up serious appendages to perfect.”
From Clive Cussler — “Harrowing, but always suspenseful, "Sign of the Cross" makes you wish it would never end.”
From Nelson DeMille — “Chris Kuzneski is a remarkable new writer, who completely understands what makes for a good story: action, sex, suspense, humor, and great characters.”

Jimmy Murphy (song)

'Jimmy Murphy' also known as 'Little Jimmy Murphy' is a song, possibly of music-hall origin, referencing the 1798 rebellion, which occurred largely in Wexford. 
According to research by Roly Brown: 'There are three versions; from Jack Barnard and a Mr J Thomas, both noted by Cecil Sharp; and a version sent to Sharp which was supplied by a Dr John Taylor who recorded it from 'a soldier'.
Each version is quite different, some not referencing the rebellion at all, but all versions sharing the distinctive nonsense refrain and a final verse stating that Jimmy Murphy was hung for courting ladies as opposed to sheep stealing.
According to Frank Harte '...it has been suggested to me that the reference in the last verse to Kate Whelan:
Now Jimmy Murphy was hanged not for sheep stealing
But for courting a pretty girl and her name was Kate Whelan
could be interpreted as a reference to Ireland as Cathleen ni Houlihan.'
'When I first heard this song, sung by Sean Óg O'Thuama many years ago, it had only three verses and that most peculiar chorus. A friend of mine, Luke Cheevers, in true traditional fashion wrote several verses, which I believe enhance the song, and expand the story.'Frank Harte

Plot.
Injured and out of shape, "Hurricane" Harry Joplin is unhappy about not being accepted for World War II duty by the Navy and unhappier still when the New York Titans decline to offer him a new contract, suggesting he become a coach instead. Harry refuses to believe his football days are over.
While his wife Kathy supports the family, Harry spends time with his son, Willie, teaching him football. But while battling his depression, Harry becomes attracted to Dee Shane, who persuades him to become an entertainer, telling his old football stories on stage. Harry thinks he's a natural for that, but flops before a big audience and proceeds to go on a three-day drinking binge.
Kathy begins seeing another man, Gordon, and it appears Harry has lost her. He tries wrestling to make a living, but his heart isn't in it. His old football coach gives Harry a last shot in a big game against the Navy, but he plays poorly and is benched. Harry asks if he can remain on the sideline for the sake of his son in the bleachers. When the war-depleted team runs out of healthy bodies, though, Harry is needed again and scores a touchdown.
Delighted to win the game and his wife back, Harry is willing to accept a coaching job now. But before he can, an admiral who saw the football game offers to gladly induct a man fit enough to sink the Navy on this field of battle.

In 1946, mechanic Nick Tacony began selling and servicing sewing machines from the basement of his home. In the 1950s, he expanded his business by wholesaling sewing parts, accessories and other merchandise to retailers in the Midwest. 
Over the next two decades, the business grew with the acquisition of two important competitors on the East Coast. Each added to the Tacony network of distribution centers and increased the organization’s customer base.
After completing his college degree in business administration and four years in the United States Air Force, Ken Tacony joined his father's business in 1970. He became CEO in 1984 and has overseen the company's growth into one of the largest American distributors of sewing machines, ceiling fans, vacuum cleaners, and commercial floor care products.

Symphony No. 37 (Haydn)

The Symphony No. 37 in C major, Hob. I/37, is a symphony by Joseph Haydn. The numbering is misleading, as it is one of Haydn's earliest symphonies. A copy of the score at Český Krumlov is dated 1758.
Movements.
The work is scored for two oboes, bassoon, two horns, trumpets, timpani and strings with continuo. It is possible the trumpet and timpani parts were added later.
The work is in four movements:
The work is one of the few symphonies of the Classical era to place the Minuet second (others include Haydn's 32nd and 44th, and his brother Michael's 15th and 16th).
Similarities have been drawn between the 2/4 opening movement and the 2/4 finale to Georg von Reutter's "Servizio di tavola" in C major from 1757. The two knew each other because Reutter was the director of music in St. Stephen's Cathedral where Haydn sang as a child.
The slow movement is very similar to the slow movement in one of Haydn's earliest piano sonatas, Hob. XVI:Es2.

Street network

A street network is a system of interconnecting lines and points that represent a system of streets or roads for a given area. A street network provides the foundation for network analysis; for example, finding the best route or creating service areas.
They greatly affect in-town movement and traffic. Street networks can become very complex in cities. Street networks are very often localized, because there is little non-highway transportation from town to town. The U.S. Highway System is like a street network, but it is national, and consists of highways instead of streets and roads.

Bill C-27 (39th Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)

Bill C-27 was proposed legislation that would have changed to Canadian laws to help prevent identity theft. A bilingual copy of the Bill is available on the Parliament of Canadas website. The bill was never passed, as it died on the order paper when Stephen Harper's government prorogued parliament in December 2008.
Proposed legislation.
Official document.
An official document was defined as follow in the Bill: "For the purposes of this section, "identity document" means a Social Insurance Number card, a driver’s licence, a health insurance card, a birth certificate, a passport as defined in subsection 57(5), a document that simplifies the process of entry into Canada, a certificate of citizenship, a document indicating immigration status in Canada or a certificate of Indian status, issued or purported to be issued by a department or agency of the federal or a provincial government, or any similar document issued or purported to be issued by a foreign government." The bill did not include debit cards and credit cards. For someone to possess someone else's official document, they would have had to have the document owner's permission or provide a valid reason. Valid include genealogical research and administration of justice.
Credit cards and debit cards.
Possessing, using, and trafficking are at the same level, without colour of right. It is not legal to possess someone else's credit card. It is not legal to possess any material that can copy or falsify credit cards. This bill would have made illegal all devices used to copy credit card data, something that was not clearly defined in previous bills.
Mail.
Mail provides another avenue for identity theft. Businesses and governments send mail containing cheques, credit cards, bank statements, and other important information. Even personal letters can contain information potentially useful to identity thieves. To protect the public, bill C-27 would have clarified the definition of identity theft. Absconding with correctly delivered mail "after it is delivered but before it is in the possession of the addressee or of a person who may reasonably be considered to be authorized by the addressee to receive mail" is considered stealing. Before, the definition ended where the mail is delivered. It was unclear whether "deliver" meant the post office put the mail in the mailbox or the intended recipient had it in their hands. This revision would have removed the ambiguity.
Forging documents.
The bill stated that people should not accept or use any document as genuine when it seems forged. A person should not make available any document they suspect are forgeries. Regardless of intent, it is a crime to make it available. Basically, one cannot claim, "People are free to do what they want with a forged document."
The bill stated that using, buying, exporting, importing, repairing any device that is used to build forged documents is unlawful. One needs an authorization, or a lawful excuse.
New content.
Identity theft and identity fraud.
Identity information is any and all data that that could be used to identify a person. Such information can be in the form of name, date of birth, signature, credit card number, debit card number, SIN, or other information. The bill also would have included other identifiers such as biological identifiers, DNA, fingerprint, retinal image, iris image, and voice print. Early in 2008, the Province of British Columbia began testing the use of such biometrics in a new enhanced drivers license.
Bill C-27 defined identity theft as the following: "Everyone commits an offence who transmits, makes available, distributes, sells or offers for sale another person’s identity information, or has it in their possession for any of those purposes, knowing or believing that or being reckless as to whether the information will be used to commit an indictable offence that includes fraud, deceit or falsehood as an element of the offence."
The bill stated that a trial would occur in the province in which the allegation has happened, or, if the accused is not in that province, the trial cannot happen without the approval of the Attorney General of that province.
Identity fraud had a different definition:
"03. (1) Everyone commits an offence who fraudulently personates any person, living or dead,
This included impersonating someone by using identity information, including impresonating someone on social networking web sites.

<doc id="18587056" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18587056" title="Visual hierarchy">
Visual hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is the order in which the human eye perceives what it sees. This order is created by the visual contrast between forms in a field of perception. Objects with highest contrast to their surroundings are recognized first by the human mind. The term visual hierarchy is used most frequently in the discourse of the visual arts fields, notably so within the field of graphic design.
Theory.
The concept of visual hierarchy is based in Gestalt psychological theory, an early 20th-century German theory that proposes that the human brain has innate organizing tendencies that “structure individual elements, shapes or forms into a coherent, organized whole.” The German word Gestalt translates into “form,” “pattern,” or “shape” in English. When an element in a visual field disconnects from the ‘whole’ created by the brain’s perceptual organization, it “stands out” to the viewer. The shapes that disconnect most severely from their surroundings stand out the most.
Physical characteristics.
The brain disassociates objects from one another based upon the differences between their physical characteristics. These characteristics fall into four categories: color, size, alignment, and character. The category of color encompasses the hue, saturation, value, and perceived texture of forms. Size describes the surface area of a form. Alignment is the arrangement of forms with respect to their direction, orientation, or pattern. Character is the rectilinearity and curvilinearity of forms. Forms that have differences in these characteristics contrast each other.
Application.
Visual hierarchy is an important concept in the field of graphic design, a field that specializes in visual organization. Designers attempt to control visual hierarchy to guide the eye to information in a specific order for a specific purpose. One could compare visual hierarchy in graphic design to grammatical structure in writing in terms of the importance of each principle to these fields.
Examples.
Fluorescent color contrasts highly against most naturally occurring colors. Fluorescent substances achieve this contrast by emitting light. Forms of this type of color are almost always high in visual hierarchy. Tennis balls are fluorescent green for the perceptual ease of players, match officials, and spectators.
Camouflage patterns diminish the contrast between themselves and their surroundings. Camouflage describes a form that mimics the physical characteristics of its environment. These patterns are difficult and sometimes impossible to perceive. Certain animals and military forces have both developed their own camouflaged patterns as mechanisms of defense.

Stop (Omar Naber song)

"Stop" was the Slovene entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, sung by Omar Naber and performed in Slovenian, despite its English title and the fact that there are two different English lyrics. 
There are two different orchestrations of the song, which were recorded, the version used at the Eurovision was the later version. Both orchestrations were used for both Slovenian and English versions, however the English lyrics were changed for the newer orchestration. Hence why there are two sets of English but only one Slovenian set.
A year later, the song was rerecorded, some sources say it was in Croatian, others say it is Serbian. Due to the similarities in both languages, it is difficult for non-speakers of the languages to be certain. Only the later Eurovision orchestration was used for this version. 
On the night of the semi-final, the song performed twenty-third, following Ireland's Donna and Joseph McCaul with "Love?" and preceding Denmark's Jakob Sveistrup and "Talking to You". At the close of voting, it had received 69 points, placing twelfth in a field of twenty five, failing to reach the final, and relegating Slovenia to the semi-final in the next contest for another year.
It was succeeded as Slovene representative at the 2006 contest by Anžej Dežan with "Mr Nobody".

Smith Estate (Los Angeles)

The Smith Estate, also known as El Mio (Spanish: ""mine"" or ""my place""), is a historic Victorian house perched on a hilltop in the Highland Park section of Los Angeles, California. The street, El Mio, is named after the house, which is how the Smith family referred to it during their residence there. Built in 1887, the house was designed in the Queen Anne style by an unknown architect. It has been the residence of a judge who wrote books on occultism, the head of the Los Angeles Railway, and a deputy mayor, and the shooting location for the cult films "Spider Baby," "Silent Scream" and "Insidious: Chapter 2.". It has also been declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Occupants of the home.
Judge Hatch.
The house was built for Judge David Patterson Hatch (1846–1912). While the National Register indicates the house was built in 1890, a newspaper article from July 1887 reported that the house was already under construction:"The frame of Judge Hatch's $10,000 residence, which is to overlook the beautiful Highland Park when completed, has now been raised and the owner is pressing the workmen to their greatest endeavors to get it completed."
Hatch became a judge in 1880 and gained fame presiding over the Perkins-Baldwin case—a breach of marriage promise case against Lucky Baldwin, a gold prospector who became one of the wealthiest men in Los Angeles and founded Santa Anita Park on his estate. The jury awarded the plaintiff $75,000—at the time "the highest amount of damages in the history of the bar of California." ("The case was followed daily by the press, and a search of the "Los Angeles Times" archives reveals more than 50 articles reporting on the contents of Lucky Baldwin's love letters and every other detail of the case. Some of the more colorful and breathless headlines from the case are included below.") In 1886, Hatch left the bench and became the senior member of the Los Angeles law firm of Hatch, Lloyd & Hunt. Hatch also became known nationally as a writer on philosophy and the occult, with works including "Scientific Occultism", "The Twentieth Century Christ", "The Blood of the Gods", "Text Book of Christian Hermit Philosophers" and the novel "El Reschid" (one of a series of books written under "the Hindoo name of Karishka"). When he died in 1912, the "Times" called him "a remarkable man" who was "exceptionally versed in the deep philosophies of life" and who had "obtained a deep knowledge of universal laws, which, although natural to himself, appeared as mysticism to those who had not followed his great mental strides."
Smith family.
Though Judge Hatch was the original occupant, the house was acquired by Charles Warren Smith in the mid or late 1890s and remained in the Smith family until the early 1960s. For this reason it became known as the Smith Estate. Charles Smith was a railroad man who was at various times the first vice president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, the receiver of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad and the general manager of the Pasadena and Los Angeles Electric Railway Company. In 1900, Henry Huntington named Smith, described as "an old-time employe (sic) of the Southern Pacific, having been with the road in its early days," as the superintendent of the Los Angeles Railway's streetcar lines. At the time of his retirement, the "Los Angeles Times" reported: "Manager Smith has earned a rest, if any one has, from years of arduous toil as the manager of great transportation properties."
During the Smiths' occupancy, the home became known for its parties. In 1901, the Smiths held a Fourth of July party at the home, which the "Los Angeles Times" described as follows:"From 8:30 until 12 o'clock dancing was enjoyed at the home of Misses Smith. The music room was decorated with pepper boughs and roses and streamers of red, white and blue ribbon hung from the center chandelier to the sides of the room. Punch was served on the side veranda, which was decorated in roses." And in June 1904, Mrs. Smith hosted a Japanese tea at the house featuring Japanese music, tea served by Japanese girls, stereoscopic views of Japan, and an address by a woman who had lived 12 years in Japan. The tea was a fundraiser, and the admission was 25 cents. One long-time Highland Park resident in the 1930s recalled the Smith house as one of the first in the area: "There were few homes in our section of Highland Park then. The C.W. Smith house which pointed an architectural finger from its hill top, a beacon for lost souls who traveled out that far ... A few other dwellings there were, but these were the landmarks." The Smiths' son, Stanley Quay Smith, married Clara Maurer in 1911, and lived at the house until his death at age 72 in 1958. According to his obituary, he had lived at the family's landmark home since 1895.
Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Gage.
Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Michael Gage bought the house in 1988 for $515,000. At the time, the "Los Angeles Times" noted that Gage was an ardent preservationist and he and his wife, Lacey, had both fallen in love with the home. The "Times" noted that the house, built on a hilltop with four bedrooms and maids' quarters, had a view of Gage's office at Los Angeles City Hall." Gage was credited in the late 1980s with reviving the political pulse of Mayor Tom Bradley's administration.
Current ownership.
As of 2008, the house had been owned for approximately eleven years by Tim and Mari Parker. The Parkers have maintained the property in impeccable condition. It is one of the best-preserved Victorian homes in Los Angeles.
On film.
In 1964, Jack Hill shot the horror comedy cult film "Spider Baby" (also known as "Attack of the Liver Eaters") at the Smith Estate. A short clip from the film showing a full view of the estate and the front porch can be viewed on YouTube.com. In 2007, writer/director Hill recalled: "We did a documentary for the DVD where I went back to the house and showed where we shot this, where we shot that. Today, of course, it's been remodeled and people are living there and it's probably worth a couple of million."
"Silent Scream" was also shot at this location. The exterior of the house can be viewed in the opening ten minutes of the film.
Insidious: Chapter 2 was shot extensively at El Mio, and the home is featured - inside and out - as one of the film's major locations.
Historic designation.
The house was declared a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #142) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 1975, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Mr Nobody (Anžej Dežan song)

"Mr Nobody" was the Slovene entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, sung by Anžej Dežan in English.
On the night of the semi-final, the song performed third, following Bulgaria's Mariana Popova with "Let Me Cry" and preceding Andorra's Jenny and "Sense tu". At the close of voting, it had received 49 points, placing sixteenth in a field of twenty three, failing to reach the final, and relegating Slovenia to the semi-final for the third successive year.
It was succeeded as Slovene representative at the 2007 contest by Alenka Gotar with "Cvet z juga".
A Slovene version of the song was performed by Dežan at EMA, the Slovene selection for Eurovision, titled "Plan B".

"I Still Love H.E.R." is a song by J-Hip-hop group, Teriyaki Boyz released as the first single from their studio album "Serious Japanese". The single was produced by and featured American rap artist Kanye West. The track references the 1994 single "I Used to Love H.E.R.," a classic rap song which tragically personified Hip-hop as a woman and former love interest, made by West's label mate Common.

The music video for "I Still Love H.E.R." is essentially a parody of the popular video sharing site YouTube. The video is in fact a video clip, apparently uploaded onto TeriyakiTube, of the Teriyaki Boyz and Kanye West performing the song. The live-action portion of the music video is intercut with still-frame animated scenes of West's mascot Dropout Bear along with cartoon versions of Verbal, Wise, Ilmari, and Ryo-Z in a red convertible trying to woo an attractive woman. The clip ends with H.E.R. hopping into the car and riding off with Dropout and the Teriyaki Boyz before transiting to a black scene which lists the two options "share" or "watch again."

Arthur Lessac

Arthur Lessac (September 9, 1909 – April 7, 2011) was the creator of Lessac Kinesensic Training for the voice and body. Lessac’s voice text teaches the “feeling process” for discovering vocal sensation in the body for developing tonal clarity, articulation, and for better connecting to text and the rhythms of speech. 
Development of ideas.
He first studied voice as a student on scholarship at the Eastman School of Music where he graduated in 1936. Lessac’s big break into the professional performance scene occurred with "Pins and Needles" in 1937, a production written and performed by members in the cultural program of the International Ladies Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU). Lessac taught his ideas of feeling sensation to the amateur performers and helped them develop their voices and bodies. Lessac’s next Broadway job came in 1939 with a group of European refugees needing accent elimination for their show "From Vienna". Lessac taught the cast how to feel and enjoy the sensations of the consonants. When the show opened, famed critic Brooks Atkinson wrote the cast spoke better English than those for whom English is their native language.
Lessac pursued his interest in health and wellness with voice and movement and gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Voice-Speech Clinical Therapy from New York University in 1941. Four years later he founded the National Academy of Vocal Arts (NAVA) and taught there until 1950. He further developed the feeling process of voice and movement studies with his 21 teachers.In 1951 he continued discovering the benefits of his work when he taught voice in the Stella Adler Theatre Studio for one year, furthering his explorations of voice and movement for actors. In the same year Lessac began his 20 year tenure with the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Lessac was in charge of teaching the students seeking ordination how to deliver sermons with good speech, voice and enthusiasm. Instead of simply reading the sermons from the weekly scrolls, Lessac taught them how to commune with the text and inspire their audiences through their vocal delivery.
Several important events happened during his time with the Jewish Theological Seminary. First, Lessac earned a Master of Arts degree in Voice-Speech Clinical Therapy from New York University in 1953 and worked with speech therapy patients at Bellevue Hospital throughout the 1950s. Lessac continued his studies in neurology and anatomy as he helped patients regain sensation in their faces and mouths through vocal explorations. Lessac helped patients with a myriad of afflictions ranging from stuttering to gaining mobility in parts of the face lacking nerve action due to Bell’s Palsy. Lessac's work on employing the spirit toward the benefit of a healthy voice developed. By focusing on what a patient could do (and not focusing on disability or lack), patients became empowered in their abilities, engaged their spirits in therapy. Moreover, Lessac’s work reiterated the importance of allowing the pleasure of feeling vocal vibration or body’s energy guide one towards optimal expression and wellness. 
Professional development.
Lessac’s work with actors changed with the publication of his book in 1960. Famed directors Elia Kazan and Robert Whitehead appointed Lessac as teacher of voice, speech, singing and dialects for their historic repertory company at the Lincoln Center in 1962. Here Lessac worked with two of the top teachers in acting and dance, Robert Lewis and Anna Sokolow. Although the company only lasted one season, working with the most respected theatre professionals at the time reveals how much of an impact his work made on the theatre community. 
In the summer of 1969, the theatre program at the State University of New York (SUNY) in Binghamton hired Lessac as full professor with immediate tenure with the mandate to develop the undergraduate and MFA acting program. The summer after his first year, he began teaching intensive workshops over 8 weeks that included all the tenets of his voice and body work. The intensives continue today each summer over 4 weeks and are taught by his master teachers of the work. Lessac left SUNY in 1981 as Professor Emeritus, but continued teaching in training programs all over the United States, Puerto Rico, Germany, Yugoslavia, South Africa, and Mexico. Lessac’s teachers and disciples felt the urgency of maintaining the pedagogical practices of the work plus the desire to expand kinesensic research into new terrain. They founded the Lessac Institute in 1998 and developed an examination for teaching certification in 2000. The Lessac Institute now has dozens of certified trainers in sixteen states as well as trainers in South Africa, Germany, Belgium, and England. In addition, there are dozens of practitioners on track for certification.
Software.
Lessac's work is the basis for a new software for text-to-speech technology being developed by Lessac Technologies, Inc. (LTI) of West Newton, Massachusetts.

Fraternities and sororities in North America

Fraternities and sororities (from the Latin words ' and ', meaning "brother" and "sister" respectively) are fraternal social organizations for undergraduate students. The term refers mainly to such organizations at colleges and universities in the United States, although it is also applied to analogous European groups also known as corporations. Similar, but less common, organizations also exist for secondary school students. In modern usage, the term "Greek letter organization" is often synonymous in the United States, with the terms "fraternity" and "sorority".
Typically, Greek letter organizations are gender-based initiatory organizations. Membership is typically considered active during the undergraduate years only, although a notable exception to this rule are historically black, Latino, Asian, and multicultural organizations, in which active membership continues, and into which members are often initiated long after the completion of their undergraduate degrees. As with Freemasonry, Greek letter organizations may sometimes be considered mutual aid societies, providing academic and social activities. Some groups also maintain a chapter house, providing residential and dining facilities for members.
Terminology.
In modern usage, the term "Greek letter organization" has become synonymous with the North American fraternity and sorority. The term "fraternity", often colloquially shortened to "frat" (though use of such term may be derogatory in some contexts), typically refers to an all-male group, while the term "sorority", created for Gamma Phi Beta by Dr. Frank Smalley, typically refers to an all-female group such as Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Phi, Pi Beta Phi, Sigma Kappa, Phi Mu, and Chi Omega. Additionally, some groups that define themselves as "fraternities" may be mixed-sex, such as Alpha Phi Omega, Phi Sigma Pi, Alpha Delta Phi Society, Psi Upsilon, Kappa Kappa Psi or Mu Phi Epsilon; the same is true of groups that define themselves as "sororities", such as Tau Beta Sigma. Due to the ambiguous nature of the terms "fraternity" and "sorority" with respect to gender, and due to the inaccuracy and potentially sexist nature of the use "fraternity" to describe aforementioned organizations, it has become commonplace to use the synonym "Greek letter organization", since the vast majority of fraternities and sororities identify themselves using Greek letters. A recent example of this is the usage of the terms "(historically) Black Greek letter organizations" (BGLOs) and "Latino Greek letter organizations" (LGOs) within the literature. However, since most of those organizations that do "not" identify themselves using Greek letters are structured similarly to and share other several common characteristics with those that do identify themselves using Greek letters, all of these organizations are still considered to be "Greek letter organizations". All this said, the public at large and most members of fraternities and sororities still use the traditional terms ("fraternity" and "sorority"), to refer to all-male and all-female groups, respectively. Coeducational service fraternities and academic honors organizations (despite sharing a common history, as well as a common naming scheme, with modern fraternities and sororities) tend to be referred to more specifically. "Greek letter organization" tends to be used in "formal" contexts, but rarely in popular discourse.
The term social fraternity is used to differentiate four-year, undergraduate, and frequently residential groups from other organizations, many of which also have Greek-letter names, such as honor societies, academic societies, or service fraternities and sororities.
History and development.
Beginnings.
The Phi Beta Kappa Society, founded on December 5, 1776, at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, is generally recognized as the first Greek-letter student society in North America. It was founded by John Heath, who had failed at admission to the two existing "Latin"-letter fraternities at the College, the F.H.C. Society (nicknamed as backronym the "Flat Hat Club") and the P.D.A. Society (nicknamed "Please Don't Ask"). The main developments associated with Phi Beta Kappa are the use of Greek-letter initials as a society name and the establishment of branches or "chapters" at different campuses, following the pattern set by Masonic lodges.
The Greek letters () come from the motto ("," "Philosophy is the helmsman of life"), now officially translated as "Philosophy is the guide of life". Greek was chosen as the language for the motto due generally to classical education at the time, and specifically because Heath "was the best Greek scholar in college." One official historian of the society, William T. Hastings, and some others believe that the society was originally known by the Latin name "Societas Philosophiae" (Philosophical Society), and that the name Phi Beta Kappa became the society name over time. This use of Greek letters was briefly preceded by the use of "Latin" letters, notably the F.H.C. Society drawing its name from its secret motto, presumed to be "Fraternitas, Humanitas, et Cognitio," or "Fraternitas Humanitas Cognitioque." (These are two renderings of "brotherhood, humanity, and knowledge.")
However, Phi Beta Kappa was very different from a typical college fraternity of today, in that the membership was generally restricted to upperclassmen, if not seniors; and men initiated as students remained active in the society after becoming members of the faculty of the host university. The annual Phi Beta Kappa exercises at Yale were public literary exercises, with as many or more faculty members of the society than undergraduate.
As Phi Beta Kappa developed, it became an influential association of faculty and select students on several college campuses, with membership becoming more of an honor and less of social selection. Many came to see the increasing influence of the society as undemocratic and contrary to the free flow of intellectual ideas in American academia. As a curious side effect of anti-masonic controversy in the early Republic, the secrets of Phi Beta Kappa were published in the appendix to a book in 1831. After that time, Phi Beta Kappa ceased to be a social fraternity in any real sense and is now only an honorary society, though prominent and respected.
Chi Phi was established at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey on December 24, 1824 on the principles of Truth, Honor, and Personal Integrity. However, shortly after the founding the Chi Phi Society (which included both faculty and student members) became inactive. Some 30 years later the name and traditions of the group were unearthed and adopted by a second organization founded at Princeton in 1854, but not as a direct outgrowth of the original organization. This was acknowledged formally by Chi Phi's national president A. Holley Rudd, at the public ceremonies in 1924 celebrating the Centennial of the original group. Two other organizations of the same name merged with it to create the modern Chi Phi Fraternity in 1874. It is also possible that other college organizations with Greek letter names may have existed prior to 1825 without having a direct influence on the future history of the fraternity system.
Union College in Schenectady, New York became the "mother" of the existing college fraternity movement with the establishment of the Kappa Alpha Society on November 26, 1825, an outgrowth of an organization called the Philosophers that was founded a year earlier as a literary society. Kappa Alpha possessed most of the distinctive elements of a modern fraternity, and was clearly the model that inspired the development of other societies according to Baird's Manual, the definitive reference work on fraternities. (The Kappa Alpha Society is distinct from the southern Kappa Alpha Order.) Kappa Alpha's founders adopted many of Phi Beta Kappa's practices, but made their organization an exclusively student group, adopted a much more elaborate ritual and doubled as a literary society. Its example encouraged the formation of two competitors on campus; the Sigma Phi Society formed in March 1827, followed by Delta Phi in November. These three are generally called the Union Triad.
The fraternity system becomes "national".
Sigma Phi was the first fraternity to expand "nationally" when it opened a second chapter at Hamilton College in 1831. That and an effort by The Kappa Alpha Society to enter Hamilton led to the formation of Alpha Delta Phi in 1832. Delta Upsilon, the first non-secret (originally anti-secret), fraternity was founded at Williams College in Massachusetts in 1834, following the establishment of chapters of Kappa Alpha and Sigma Phi in 1833 and 1834, respectively. Beta Theta Pi was founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in August 1839 in response to the chartering of the new chapter of Alpha Delta Phi. Kappa Kappa Kappa, the nation's oldest local fraternity was founded in 1842 at Dartmouth College. Delta Kappa Epsilon was founded in June 1844 at Yale College, followed by Alpha Sigma Phi in December 1845. Phi Delta Theta (1848) and Sigma Chi (1855) were founded at Miami University. Along with Beta Theta Pi, these three fraternities have been called the Miami Triad. Also, around that time the Jefferson Duo was formed at Jefferson college in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, consisting of Phi Gamma Delta (1848) and Phi Kappa Psi (1852). Although this is a duo, it is recorded along with the other triads formed at the time. Union College continued its role as the "Mother of Fraternities" with the founding of Psi Upsilon (1833), Chi Psi (1841) and Theta Delta Chi (1847). With this second "triad", Union College can lay claim to the foundation of nearly half of the thirteen oldest fraternities in the country. Delta Tau Delta was founded in 1858 at Bethany College in Bethany, Virginia (modern day West Virginia). It later absorbed a southern fraternity known as Rainbow Fraternity due to declining membership in the south following the Civil War.
The Mystical 7 was founded at Wesleyan University in 1837, and established the first chapters in the South, at Emory in 1841, and elsewhere. Sigma Alpha Epsilon was founded at the University of Alabama in 1856, and it is the only fraternity founded in the Antebellum South that still operates., Then in 1847, Phi Alpha Pi was founded at Olivet College (Michigan), and it remains the oldest house on campus. Phi Alpha Pi is the brother house to Iota Kappa Omicron
Growth was then mainly stunted by the Civil War. Theta Xi, founded at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York on April 29, 1864, is the only fraternity to be established during the War. However, following the War, the system as a whole underwent strong growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, both in the number of organizations founded and chapters of existing organizations established. This was aided, in part, by the reopening of schools and the return of veterans as students. Alpha Tau Omega was the first Fraternity founded after the Civil War, and it also was the first Fraternity to be founded as a national organization, not local or regional.
Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Rho Psi, Phi Sigma Nu, Zeta Beta Tau, and Alif Laam Meem - Alpha Lambda Mu (as a national fraternity) were founded as the first fraternities for African-American, Latino-American, Asian-American, Native American, Jewish, and Muslim students, respectively.
Greek letters.
The names of North American fraternities and sororities generally consist of two or three Greek letters, often the initials of a Greek motto, which may be secret. For example: Phi Beta Kappa (Society), from phi (φ) + beta (β) + kappa (κ), initials of the society's Greek motto, "φιλοσοφια βιου κυβερνητης" ("philosophia biou kybernētēs"), meaning "philosophy is the guide of life".
Fraternities and sororities are referred to by the encompassing term "Greek letter organization" and described by the adjective "Greek", as seen in phrases such as "Greek community", "Greek system", "Greek life", or members as "Greeks". An individual fraternity or sorority is often called a "Greek house" or simply "house," terms that may be misleading, since it could be taken to refer to a chapter's physical property, whereas many fraternities and sororities do not have a chapter house. "Chapter" and "organization" are used in these contexts, with the latter referring to the group as a collective entity, and the former referring to a specific division of such entity, though not all fraternities and sororities have multiple chapters.
The use of Greek letters started with Phi Beta Kappa, then a social fraternity and today an honor society, at the College of William & Mary. Several groups, however, do not use Greek letters. Examples include Acacia, FarmHouse, and Triangle, as well as final clubs, eating clubs, secret societies at some Ivy League colleges, such as Skull and Bones at Yale and the military affiliated fraternity the National Society of Pershing Rifles. Alpha Epsilon Pi uses Greek letters for its North American chapters but Hebrew letters for its Israeli chapters, with the Herzliya IDC chapter designated "Aleph", and the Hebrew University chapter "Bet". The name of Alif Laam Meem - Alpha Lambda Mu is derived from an ayah of the Quran which contains only three Arabic letters: Alif (ا), Laam (ل), and Meem (م), hence "Alif Laam Meem" (2:1). The meaning of this ayah (verse) is unknown. The fraternity is named after those three Arabic letters in addition to their formal Greek equivalents: Alpha, Lambda and Mu.
Types of Greek letter organizations.
Most Greek letter organizations are social organizations, presenting themselves as societies to help their members better themselves in a social setting.
A variety of Greek letter organizations are distinguished from social groups by their function. They can be specifically organized for service to the community, for professional advancement, or for scholastic achievement.
Certain organizations were established for specific religious or ethnic groups, while others focus on numerous qualifications. For example, Phi Sigma Pi, the only national honor fraternity, stresses both academic achievement and leadership in the community. Some social organizations are expressly Christian, such as Alpha Chi Rho (founded as Christian, presently non-exclusive). Jewish fraternities, such as Alpha Epsilon Pi, Zeta Beta Tau, and Sigma Alpha Mu (historically Jewish, but has been non-sectarian since the 1950s) were established, in part, in response to restrictive clauses that existed in many social fraternities' laws barring Jewish membership, which were removed in the mid-20th century. A controversy remains between the idea of creating supportive communities for distinct groups on the one hand and the intent to create non-discriminatory communities on the other.
There are also organizations with a cultural or multicultural emphasis. For example, Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi, both African American Fraternities, were established at Cornell University in 1906 and Indiana University – Bloomington in 1911, respectively, the first Chinese fraternity, established at Cornell in 1916, and Sigma Iota, the first Hispanic fraternity, established at Louisiana State University in 1904. The latter later merged with other Hispanic fraternities and organizations around the nation to form Phi Iota Alpha, the oldest Latino fraternity in existence, in 1931. The Phi Sigma Alpha fraternity in Puerto Rico can also trace its roots back to Sigma Iota. There are now 20 Latino fraternities in the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations. A distinct set of black fraternities and sororities also exists, although black students are not barred from non-black organizations and there are black members of non-black organizations. Non African-American students are also not barred from predominately African American fraternities and sororities.
Organizations designed for particular class years do exist, but are usually categorized separately from other types of Greek letter organizations. While these were once common in older institutions in the Northeast, the only surviving underclass society is Theta Nu Epsilon, which is specifically for sophomores. Many senior class societies also survive, and they are often simply referred to as Secret Societies.
Competition and cooperation.
Early fraternal societies were very competitive for members, for academic honors, and for any other benefit or gain. Some of this competition was seen as divisive on college campuses. Today there is still competition, but that competition is intended to be within limits, and for nobler purposes, such as charitable fundraising. Often, organizations compete in various sporting events. There is also a greater emphasis on interfraternity cooperation. The single greatest effort along these lines was the creation of the National Interfraternity Council, now the North American Interfraternity Conference, a century ago, which was intended to minimize conflicts, destructive competition, and encourage student members to recognize members of other fraternities and sororities as people who share common interests. The National Panhellenic Conference regulations has similar goals to unite national sororities.
Structure and organization.
Most Greek letter organizations were originally organized on one campus. An organization that has only one established chapter is a "local." A local can authorize chapters of the same name at other campuses. After the first authorized chapter, a local is considered a "national," even if it only has two chapters. Over the past 180 years, North America has accrued several large national organizations with hundreds of chapters. Two or more nationals can also merge, and some of the larger nationals were created this way. Several national fraternities are international, which usually means they have chapters in Canada.
A local organization can petition one of the existing national organizations and be absorbed into their organization dropping all ties to the former local organization. Recently this has become the preferred method for expansion within national organizations because the members have already formed a bond and presence on campus but are changing their name, ritual, and structure.
The central business offices of the organizations are also commonly referred to as "Nationals". Nationals may place certain requirements on individual chapters to standardize rituals and policies regarding membership, housing, finances, or behavior. These policies are generally codified in a constitution and bylaws. Greek letter organizations may once have been governed by the original chapter, but virtually all have adopted some version of governance with executive officers who report to a board of trustees, and 'legislative' body consisting of periodic conventions of delegates from all the chapters.
Rituals and symbols.
Most Greek letter organizations maintain traditions, sometimes accompanied by secret rituals, which are generally symbolic in nature. They include an initiation ceremony, and may also include passwords, songs, and handshakes. For example, writer Julian Hawthorne, the son of Nathaniel Hawthorne, wrote (in his posthumously published "Memoirs") of an ironic coincidence surrounding his fraternal initiation:
I was initiated into a college secret society—a couple of hours of grotesque and good-humored rodomontade and horseplay, in which I cooperated as in a kind of pleasant nightmare, confident, even when branded with a red-hot iron or doused head-over heels in boiling oil, that it would come out all right. The neophyte is effectively blindfolded during the proceedings, and at last, still sightless, I was led down flights of steps into a silent crypt, and helped into a coffin, where I was to stay until the Resurrection...Thus it was that just as my father passed from this earth, I was lying in a coffin during my initiation into Delta Kappa Epsilon.
Meetings of active members are generally kept private and not discussed without formal approval of the chapter as a whole.
For organizations with Greek letters composing their name, these letters are the initials of a motto (such as Delta Upsilon), a set of virtues (such as Alpha Kappa Lambda), or the history of its organization (such as Phi Tau).
Greek letter organizations often have a number of distinctive emblems, such as colors, flags, flowers, in addition to a badge (or pin), coat of arms, and/or seal. An open motto (indicating that the organization has a "secret motto" as well) is used to express the unique ideals of a fraternity or sorority.
Pins or badges.
Pins have become increasingly popular to collect, even by individuals who never were members. Groups such as the Fraternity Pin Collector Society have collected thousands of pins worth tens of thousands of dollars in individual collections while organizations such as Kappa Kappa Gamma's "Keepers of the Key" work to reunite lost or stolen badges with their original owners.
According to , the primary fraternal jewelers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were D. L. Auld Co. of Columbus, L.G. Balfour Company of Attleboro, Mass., Burr, Patterson and Co. of Detroit, Upmeyer Company of Milwaukee, A. H. Fetting Co. of Baltimore, Hoover and Smith Co. of Philadelphia, O. C. Lanphear of Galesburg, Ill., Miller Jewelry Co. of Cincinnati, J. F. Newman of New York, Edward Roehm of Detroit, and Wright, Kay and Co. of Detroit. Currently the most widely used jewelers are Herff Jones and Jostens. Jewelers' initials and stampings are typically found on the back of pins along with the member name and/or chapter information. The history of fraternal jewelers is important when determining age of non-dated jewelry pieces.
Since fraternity and sorority pins are used as the primary symbols for societies, licensing and marketing concerns have developed. As a result, many of the larger organizations have had to put a legal team on retainer as consultants.
Coat of arms.
Fraternities and Sororities have coat of arms that represent the familial aspect of brotherhood and sisterhood. The greatest representation of fraternal coat of arms is found in yearbooks and chapter publications from 1890 to 1925. Engravings were made of coat of arms and tipped into the yearbooks, often later removed and framed. Sizes range from a square inch to a full page layout. Many of these engravings were signed, creating a period art form.
Fraternal coat of arms engravings were typically made by cutting lines in metal or wood for the purpose of printing reproduction. The earliest known engravings printed on paper in this fashion date back to the 16th century. Much of the engravings done in the 19th century were metal engravings where the image was carved into a piece of steel or iron. In the early 20th century, it became more common to use photo-engraving, or photogravure to print the coat of arms.
Believing in their beginnings in Greek tradition, Alpha Omicron Pi is the only Greek organization that does not have a coat of arms, and instead uses a Jacqueminot rose as their symbol. A coat of arms is a medieval or masonic tradition, and therefore has no roots in the Greek tradition.
Objects.
Apparel such as shirts, pants, bags, canteens, jewelry and key chains are often worn by members with their Greek letters on them. These shirts and other articles may later be used for a pass-down ceremony between seniors and fellow members. Seniors may choose to pass down some or all of the clothing they own that is associated with the sorority. Some of the shirts are ten or more years old and in some chapters, girls will compete for them. In those chapters, generally members feel it is an honor to have older artifacts. At some institutions, it is considered inappropriate and may be prohibited to wear apparel with the society's name when the member is consuming alcohol. It is considered disrespectful to have their letters on when drinking, regardless of their age. Also, it is generally taboo for non-members to wear any apparel with a group's letters.
Membership pins are not worn at all times. Some organizations limit pin-wearing to times of professional or business dress, also known as "Pin Attire".
Chapter houses.
Unique among most campus organizations, members of social Greek letter organizations often live together in a large house or distinct part of the university dormitories. This can help emphasize the "bonds of brotherhood or sisterhood" and provide a place of meeting for the members of the organization as well as alumni. For reasons of cost, liability, and stability, housing is usually owned or overseen by an alumni corporation or the organization's national headquarters. As a result, some houses have visitor restrictions, and some national organizations restrict or prohibit alcohol on the premises.
At some colleges where chapters do not have residential houses for the general membership, they may still have chapter houses where meals are served for their membership and guests.
Joining.
The process of joining a Greek letter organization varies from organization to organization. Organizations governed by the National Panhellenic Conference or the North-American Interfraternity Conference commonly begin their process with a formal recruitment period, often called "rush week," or formal recruitment, which usually consists of events and activities designed for members and potential members to learn about each other and the organization. At the end of the formal recruitment period, organizations give "bids", or invitations to membership. Most organizations have a period of "pledgeship" before extending full membership. Some organizations have changed the name of pledgeship due to negative connotations to the process (such as calling pledges "Zobes" or "new members"), or have given up the process in favor of other joining requirements. Upon completion of the pledgeship and all its requirements, the active members will invite the pledges to be initiated and become full members. Initiation often includes secret ceremonies and rituals. Organizations governed by the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), or the National Multicultural Greek Council (NMGC) have very different recruitment processes. The fraternities and sororities associated with these councils often do not participate in a typical recruitment process nor do they host a rush week. Instead interested students must formally express their interest to a member, or more often than not, members of the particular organization they are interested in.
Requirements may be imposed on those wishing to pledge either by the school or the organization itself, often including a minimum grade point average, wearing a pledge pin, learning about the history and structure of the organization, and performing public service. When a school places an age or tenure requirement on joining, this is called "deferred recruitment", as joining is deferred for a semester or year. The pledgeship period also serves as a probationary period in which both the organization and the pledge decide if they are compatible and will have a fulfilling experience.
Controversy and criticism.
Impact on members.
A 1996 study examined the cognitive effects of fraternity/sorority affiliation during the first year of college. Statistical controls were made for individual pre-college ability and academic motivation as well as gender, ethnicity, age, credit hours taken, work responsibilities, and other factors. Data showed that men who were members of fraternities had significantly lower end-of-first-year reading comprehension, mathematics, critical thinking, and composite achievement than their peers who were not affiliated with a Greek organization. Sorority membership also had a negative effect on cognitive development. However, only the effects for reading comprehension and composite achievement were significant and the magnitude of the negative influence tended to be smaller for women than for men.
A follow-up study in 2006 by the same researchers and using similar sampling techniques and controls showed that negative effects of fraternity/sorority affiliation were much less pronounced during the second and third year of college than during the first year of college. On objective, standardized measures of cognitive skills, the effects of Greek affiliation continued to be negative for both men and women, but they were substantially smaller in magnitude and only one could be considered statistically significant (a negative effect for fraternity membership on end-of-third-year reading comprehension). The study also included self-reported measures of students’ cognitive growth. For men, fraternity membership continued to exert small negative effects in the second and third years of college, but only one was statistically significant. For women the impacts of sorority membership on self-reported gains were just the opposite. In both the second and third years of college, sorority membership exerted small positive effects on all self-reported gains measures, several of which reached statistical significance.
George D. Kuh, Ernest T. Pascarella, and Henry Wechsler used research from the National Study of Student Learning (NSSL) and concluded that “fraternities are indifferent to academic values and seem to short-change the education of many members.”
A 2006 study which was published in the "American Journal of Economics and Sociology" found that fraternity and sorority members suffered from 1 to 10 percent lower cumulative GPAs (Grade Point Average) than non-affiliated students. This negative effect was most pronounced for small fraternities and weakest for sororities. Further impact was demonstrated by a study in the Journal of College Student Development, which surveyed college men, both fraternity/sorority-affiliated and non-affiliated, from freshman year to senior year and tested their scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The study shows that affiliated men have significantly higher self-esteem then their non-affiliated counterparts.
Hazing issues.
Hazing is the harassment of new members as a rite of passage, by giving them meaningless, difficult, dangerous or humiliating tasks to perform, exposing them to ridicule, or playing practical jokes on them. It is a crime in 44 states, and most educational institutions have their own definitions of, and prohibitions against, hazing, many required by state statutes.
Fraternities and sororities are commonly associated with paddling of members, especially new members or pledges, as part of their hazing rituals.
Due to the nature of hazing and the secretive nature of Greek letter organizations, hazing is largely underreported. Most, if not all, hazing activities take place during pledge (or "interest") activities.
Exclusionary nature.
Some colleges and universities have banned Greek letter organizations with the justification that they are, by their very structure, set up to be elitist and exclusionary. The most famous, and oldest ban was at Princeton , though Princeton has now had fraternities since the 1980s. Oberlin College banned "secret societies" (fraternities and sororities) in 1847, and the prohibition continues to the present. Quaker universities such as Guilford College and Earlham College often ban fraternities and sororities because they are seen as a violation of the Quaker principle of equality.
Fraternities have been banned in recent times from Williams College, Bowdoin College, Middlebury College, and Amherst College.
Stanford University banned sororities in 1944, but not fraternities. They were restored in 1977 under Title IX. The Yeshiva University administration enforce a strict ban, and non-recognition of fraternities citing their exclusionary nature. The University of Victoria also held a ban until a controversial repeal in 2010, which has paved the way for the university's first fraternity (Delta Kappa Epsilon) and sorority (Kappa Beta Gamma). Fraternities do not require recognition by a university.
North American Greek letter organizations in other regions.
North American Greek letter organizations (NAGLO) are present almost exclusively in the United States and the English-speaking universities of Canada, with a minority of organizations having chapters elsewhere, such as the Caribbean, Africa, and some in France there have also been temporary accommodations. Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, a prominent historically African-American Sorority, currently has chapters in the Virgin Islands and Bermuda. There was a brief chapter of Chi Phi at Edinburgh, Scotland during the American Civil War to accommodate Southern students studying abroad, and another for American servicemen who were still college students during World War II, but there has been no real export of the system to Europe.
Sororities.
The Independent Order of Odd Fellows, also known as the three link fraternity, was the first organization to form a woman's auxiliary when it formed the Daughters of Rebekah in 1851 but the term sorority was not yet coined during that time. However, many of the first societies for women were not modeled as fraternities, but were woman's versions of the common Latin literary societies. The Adelphean Society (now Alpha Delta Pi) was established in 1851 at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia. The Philomathean Society (now Phi Mu) was founded at Wesleyan College a year later in 1852. The Adelphean Society and the Philomathean Society did not take on their modern Greek names (Alpha Delta Pi and Phi Mu, respectively) until 1904 when they expanded beyond the Wesleyan campus. They are now often referred to as the Macon Magnolias. Many aspects of Alpha Delta Pi and Phi Mu (such as the stars and hands on their badges and the mascot of the lion) are similar due to the fact that while at Wesleyan a founder of Alpha Delta Pi, Eugenia Tucker Fitzgerald, and Phi Mu's Mary Ann DuPont (Lines) were roommates.
On April 28, 1867, I.C. Sorosis (later known by its original Greek motto Pi Beta Phi) was founded at Monmouth College, in Monmouth, Illinois. It is the first sorority founded on the model of the men's fraternity. A year later it established a second chapter at Iowa Wesleyan College. Three years later on October 13, 1870, Kappa Kappa Gamma was founded. These two fraternities were later known as the Monmouth Duo.
On January 27, 1870, Kappa Alpha Theta was formed at DePauw University as the first Greek Lettered Fraternity known among women.
In the mid-19th century, previously all-male universities began to admit women, and many women students felt it was in their best interest to band together. The first collegiate women formed woman's fraternities in an effort to counteract the widespread opposition to their presence . Others disagree with this agonistic historical view.
Alpha Delta Pi was the first sorority, founded in 1851 at Wesleyan College. The earliest organizations were founded as "women's fraternities" or "fraternities for women;" the term "sorority" was coined by professor Frank Smalley in 1874, in reference to the Greek organization, Gamma Phi Beta being established at Syracuse University. Kappa Kappa Gamma (1870) and Pi Beta Phi (1867), known as "The Monmouth Duo", were both founded at Monmouth College in Monmouth, Illinois. Alpha Phi was established at Syracuse University first, in 1872. Along with Alpha Gamma Delta, these three sororities make up the Syracuse Triad. The first organization to adopt the word "sorority" was Gamma Phi Beta, established on November 11, 1874 at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. In 1873, Delta Gamma was founded at the Lewis School for Girls in Oxford, Mississippi. In 1874, Sigma Kappa was also founded in Waterville, Maine at Colby College. Also founded at DePauw University, was Alpha Chi Omega in 1885. Delta Delta Delta was founded at Boston University in 1888. Like Pi Beta Phi, Tri Delta was modeled after the men's fraternity. In 1893, Alpha Xi Delta was founded at Lombard College in Galesburg, Illinois. Just a few years later, Chi Omega Fraternity was founded April 5, 1895 at the University of Arkansas. January 2, 1897, Alpha Omicron Pi was founded at Barnard College of Columbia University. Later in 1897 Kappa Delta was founded in Farmville, Virginia at Longwood University. A year later, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Zeta Tau Alpha followed by Alpha Sigma Alpha were founded, also at Longwood and are called the Farmville Four. After, Alpha Sigma Tau was founded in 1899.
Alpha Kappa Alpha, Lambda Theta Alpha, Alpha Pi Omega were founded as the first sororities by and for African-American, Latina-American, and Native American members respectively. Theta Phi Alpha fraternity was founded in 1912 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to women of the Catholic faith. Theta Phi is now open to members of all race and religion. In 1913, at Hunter College, New York, Phi Sigma Sigma became the first non-denominational sorority, allowing any woman, regardless of race, religion, or economic background into membership.
A number of sororities have been founded at the graduate school level. In 1917, at New York University School of Law five female law students founded Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority. Currently active collegiate membership is only open to undergraduates. Although, this year a colony was started by the name of Alpha Sigma Alpha. This year's members and new recruits will be named founding members when the colony becomes initiated into a "Chapter" later this year.
In North America, there are certain sororities that are considered bigger in Southern states just like certain sororities are bigger in the Northern states.
High school fraternities and sororities.
High school fraternities and sororities (or secondary school fraternities and sororities), are social organizations for high school-aged students.
Torch and Dagger (later Omega Eta Tau) was the first such organization and was established in Council Bluffs, Iowa in 1859. The movement more generally developed in the 1870s with Gamma Sigma, Alpha Zeta and Alpha Phi, all closely modeled on college fraternities in their areas. Some of these early groups were discussed in the early editions of "Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities" under the heading "Academic Societies". In 1913, "American Secondary School Fraternities" by J. Ward Brown, provided a detailed history of these organizations. By that time there were at least 57 national fraternities and 21 national sororities. Some like Gamma Delta Psi, Gamma Eta Kappa, Delta Sigma, Delta Sigma Nu, Lambda Sigma, Sigma Phi Upsilon and Phi Sigma Chi were spread broadly across the entire country, but most were regional in nature given the difficulty for high school students to travel. Typical of those that survive are Phi Kappa, limited to around 50 chapters in the deep south (with five still active) and Omega Gamma Delta with more than 100 chapters in the northeast (two still active) and a couple of chapters further afield. In addition there were an enormous number of local fraternities scattered around the country.
Another 15 nationals were founded after this period including several that still exist. But starting around 1910, a strong anti-fraternity movement among high school administrators took a heavy toll on such organizations in many parts of the country. A reduced level of interest by high school students themselves since 1970, has brought the number down even further.
The largest such organizations are Aleph Zadik Aleph with around 250 chapters and Sigma Alpha Rho (SAR) with more than 100. Both of these have the advantage of being sponsored by Jewish community groups and are more than simple fraternities. Beyond that, Gamma Eta Kappa, Delta Sigma, Phi Lambda Epsilon and Theta Phi all had more than 75 chapters over the years, with Omega Gamma Delta and Phi Sigma Kappa having more than 100 each.
Several nationals also had chapters in Canada and, in recent years, a whole class of similar fraternities has emerged in the Philippines, many of them outgrowths of sponsoring college organizations.
The fraternity tradition still has pockets of interest. Beyond Aleph Zadik Aleph, Sigma Alpha Rho, Omega Gamma Delta and Phi Kappa, there are similar groups such as the Order of DeMolay sponsored by the Masons. Alpha Omega Theta of New York still exists, though not in high schools, ΕΣAΔΕ is in Barcelona, The Lounge operates in Saginaw, Michigan; Phi Eta Sigma and Zeta Mu Gamma are located in Puerto Rico; Sigma Nu Xi is on the mainland United States. Sigma Delta Chi is an active sorority that was established in Alabama and continues today with several different chapters throughout Alabama, Tennessee and Florida. Although these are analogous societies, they are considered wholly different and unrelated societies. The Sub Deb Club, also known as "Sigma Delta Chi" was chartered in Athens, Alabama, in 1965, as a service and social sorority for young ladies who are students at Athens High School; Sub Deb Clubs or local chapters can be found in neighboring towns such as Decatur, Hunstville, Florence, Sheffield, Russellville, and Pulaski, Tennessee. Theta Phi Delta was the second high school sorority founded in Durham, North Carolina in 1996 and was incorporated in 2004. Fox Theta Delta, is a Philippines fraternity, founded in Butuan City in 1977, and claiming a somewhat tenuous connection with an American organization in Michigan.
Other countries.
Other countries have similar institutions; in German-speaking countries (including the non-German linguistic regions of Switzerland) these are significantly older, and fall under the umbrella term of Studentenverbindung, including the Burschenschaften, Landsmannschaften, Corps, Turnerschaften, Sängerschaften, Catholic Corporations (such as the German CV), Wingolf, Christian Corporations (such as the Schweizerischer Studentenverein) and Ferialverbindungen.
In Belgium there are student clubs similar to the German Studentenverbindungen, however they are not the same. The main differences being that clubs do not own a clubhouse with dorms but rather have a bar where they regularly meet and there is no fencing. The largest clubs are based around a specific academic course or a collection of them, the others usually are based on regional origins of the students and the others are simply a group of friends or patrons of the same bar.
In the United Kingdom, there are a limited number of student dining clubs, which are similar to American eating clubs which were later eclipsed by Greek societies. Some, such as the well-known Bullingdon Club at Oxford University, are socially exclusive due to being prohibitively expensive. Several secret societies exist, the most famous being the Cambridge Apostles, also known as the Cambridge Conversazione Society.
In Portugal, there are also fraternities, especially in Coimbra, the city with the oldest university in the country and one of the oldest in Europe. These houses, called "Repúblicas", are independent, protected by law, and run by students. They first appeared in 1309 when King D. Dinis first ordered to build student housing for the recently founded University of Coimbra, in 1290. The name, translating to "Republic", represents the house spirit: every member of the house participates in the household tasks and decisions are made unanimously. There are 27 Republics in Coimbra, 3 in Lisbon and 1 in Oporto. Republicas are also found in Brazil, like at the Federal University of Ouro Preto in Ouro Preto, in the state of Minas Gerais, and at the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA) in Lavras' City, also in the state of Minas Gerais.
In Sweden and Finland, there are similar student institutions in called Nations. At the oldest Nordic universities, the Nations have existed since the late 16th and early 17th centuries, inspired by the German Landsmannschaften. The universities in Uppsala, Lund, and Helsinki have the oldest Nations. Since the beginning, the Nations have been social gatherings for students that came from the same parts of the country, and they are also named after parts of Sweden and Finland. Their main purpose has always been to provide support to out-of-town students in various ways, even financial help. Nations have also been founded at younger universities like the ones in Umeå and Linköping. It has been mandatory for students attending the universities of Uppsala and Lund to be members of nations until the autumn of 2010. After the mandatory membership was abolished by the parliament the Nations of Sweden are now contemplating founding a League of Nations to help further connections between Nations and universities.
In France there is no such exclusive student organisation. In most schools or University there is a Student office (BDE, Bureau des Élèves) that is elected by student to organise student life and activities. It often organize bonding activities for the newcomers of the school called integration.

Dominion of British West Florida

The Dominion of British West Florida is a separatist micronation founded in 2005 "on an eccentric interpretation of actual historic events" and based in the Gulf coast region of the United States. It claims the territory of the 18th century colony of West Florida, which has since been subsumed into the US states of Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
The Dominion claims to be "striving for Dominion Status as a Commonwealth Realm, on a par with Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and The Bahamas.". The organization is neither acknowledged by any government nor exercises any authority over its claimed territory, and activities are largely limited to the internet.
History.
The micronation was founded in November 2005 in order to "reassert Britain's rights" over the region, by an individual identified on the micronation's website only as "Robert VII, Duke of Florida" The website asserts that Duke Robert "inherited the Peerage of the Dominion" in 1969, and "accepted the position of Governor General" in 1994. The micronation has issued cinderella stamps and has minted several base metal coins produced by Jorge Vidal and issued in denominations based on pre-decimal pounds.
The founders of the micronation assert that the US annexation was illegal, because control of the region had actually defaulted to the United Kingdom in 1808, upon the removal from office of King Charles IV of Spain, thus invalidating the Treaty of Paris and the US annexation to which it gave rise. This interpretation of historic events is not supported by any mainstream historian.

Francesco Maria Nocchieri

Francesco Maria Nocchieri, born in Ancona, was a seventeenth-century Italian sculptor of minor reputation active in Rome, where he spent time in the large studio of Bernini. He worked largely as a restorer of antiquities. He was among the many Roman sculptors patronised by Christina, Queen of Sweden in her retirement in Rome; for Christina he executed an "Apollo" (1680) to complement a set of Roman sculptures of Muses that had been found at Hadrian's Villa, which were doubtless restored by Nocchieri; the "Apollo" is now at La Granja de San Ildefonso. The largest collection of Nocchieri's sculptures today are in the Gardens of Aranjuez, Madrid.
A terracotta "bozzetto" at the Ashmolean Museum represents "Apollo holding his lyre, attentive to the Muses".

Style battling

Style battling is a rising art form originating in New York City, where young designers go head to head, live on stage to create fashion outfits in less than 5 minutes, from vintage material and unusual items. 
In a standard Style battling event, 8 designers or design teams compete in one-on-one battles through three knockout rounds (the round of eight, the semi-finals, and the final), designing on professional models, who then walk the catwalk. A panel of style VIP judges and/or the audience determine the winner of each battle based on three criteria: innovation, performance, and It-factor. 
The first national tour of this sport/art--called STYLE WARS: The Style Battle Championships--hit NYC, LA, San Francisco, Chicago, and Miami, in the fall of 2007. A Grand Finale in NYC in May 2008 crowned Miami designer Karelle Levy (of the krelwear label) as the first US Style Wars champion. 
(Denver's Style Wars winner was Project Runway runner-up Mondo Guerra.) The second US Tour took place in fall 2009. STYLE WARS 'style battles' have been staged in worldwide, in cities including Buenos Aires, London, Johannesburg, and Singapore.
House of Diehl are considered the originators of Style Battling, and are the owners of the STYLE WARS(tm) property.
Tag lines for this event include 'the 8-Mile of Style' and 'WWD meets WWF.'

Friendly Fires (album)

Friendly Fires is the debut album from British band Friendly Fires. It was released in the UK on 1 September 2008 where it reached a peak of number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. All tracks were produced by Ed Macfarlane apart from the first track, "Jump in the Pool", which was produced by Paul Epworth. The album was re-released on 31 August 2009 with the addition of five highly sought after remixes of the album's original tracks, plus three new tracks: "Bored of Each Other", "Relationships" and "Kiss of Life", the latter of which was also produced by Paul Epworth.
Reception.
"Friendly Fires" originally debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 38 on 13 September 2008. The following week, the album fell to number 88, before falling out of the Top 100 the week after. The album re-entered the Top 100 on two occasions, firstly at number 75 on 1 November 2008 and then again at number 95 on 21 December 2008, where it remained within the Top 100 for four consecutive weeks.
On 16 May 2009, the album re-entered the Top 100 once more at number 89, where it slowly began to climb the chart, eventually reaching number 37 on 6 June 2009. The album then slowly fell, before climbing to number 36 on 1 August 2009, weeks before the re-release of the album, due to being short-listed for the Mercury Prize of 2009.
The album was re-released in its deluxe format on 31 August 2009, and after falling to number 66, jumped to a new peak position of number 21 on 12 September 2009, where it remained on the chart for 3 more weeks before falling out of the Top 100.

Gacyclidine

Gacyclidine (GK-11) is a psychoactive drug which acts as a dissociative via functioning as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It is closely related to phencyclidine (PCP), and specifically, is a derivative of tenocyclidine (TCP).
Synthesis.
The condensation of 2-methylcyclohexanone (I) with 2-thienyllithium (II) or 2-thienylmagnesium bromide (III) gives cyclohexanol (IV) as a diastereomeric mixture, which was treated with sodium azide (NaN3) in trichloroacetic acid to yield the azide (V). The reduction of (V) with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) or Raney nickel in isopropanol affords the corresponding amine (VI), preferentially with the "cis"-configuration. Finally, this compound is condensed with 1,5-dibromopentane (VII) by means of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) in acetonitrile to provide the target compound as a diastereomeric mixture.

Jacob Stumm

Jacob Stumm (26 August 1853 – 23 January 1921) was an Australian politician. Born in Frankfurt am Main in Germany, he migrated to Australia as a child and was educated at state schools in Toowoomba before becoming a Hansard reporter, a journalist and the proprietor of the "Gympie Times". He also invested in dairying and gold mining. Stumm used his newspaper to campaign against the sitting member for Gympie, Andrew Fisher (who later became Labor's second Prime Minister of Australia), accusing Fisher of being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti-Catholic. He defeated Fisher and in 1896 was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as the member for Gympie, a position he held until 1899. In 1913, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Liberal member for the new seat of Lilley. His retirement in 1917 was partly due to his German birth. After his retirement he invested in newspapers, mining and horse racing. Stumm died in 1921.

Alberto Castillo (pitcher)

Alberto Castillo Betancourt (born July 5, 1975) is a former Cuban professional baseball pitcher.
Amateur career.
Castillo played for Cuba in the 1993 World Junior Championships in Windsor, Ontario, at which time he defected.
Professional career.
Giants and Yankees.
After being selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 1994 amateur draft, Castillo began his career in the Giants organization as a first baseman, although he did pitch a few times that season for the Everett Giants. After playing first base exclusively in 1995, he was converted to a full-time pitcher the following year.
He spent two more seasons in the Giants system, playing for the Bellingham Giants in 1996 and the San Jose Giants in 1997. That offseason, he was traded by the Giants to the New York Yankees in November 1997 as part of a package for Charlie Hayes. Castillo spent just one season, 1998, in the Yankees' farm system, splitting the season between the Greensboro Bats and Tampa Yankees.
Northern League.
The Yankees released Castillo in January 1999, and he was signed by the Chicago White Sox. The White Sox released Castillo during spring training, and he spent the 1999 season with the Schaumburg Flyers of the independent Northern League. In 2000, Castillo was brought to spring training by the San Diego Padres, but they, too, released him, and Castillo returned to the Flyers.
Atlantic League.
After the 2000 season, Castillo was signed by the Tampa Bay Rays, but he missed the entire 2001 season, and was released before the beginning of the 2002 season. He returned to the independent leagues, signing with the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 2003, he was again invited to spring training by an MLB team, this time the St. Louis Cardinals. Once again, however, he was released before the season began, and he returned to the Bears.
In 2004, Castillo found himself without a major league team in the spring for the first time. He started the 2004 season with the Atlantic City Surf of the Atlantic League, then played for the Tuneros de San Luis Potosí of the Mexican League. After missing 2005 due to elbow surgery, Castillo played for the Atlantic League's Road Warriors in 2006 and the beginning of 2007. He finished 2007 with the Camden Riversharks.
Baltimore Orioles.
Castillo finally returned to affiliated baseball when he was signed to a minor league contract by the Baltimore Orioles in 2008. He began that season with the Baltimore Orioles' Triple-A affiliate, the Norfolk Tides, before making his major league debut on April 28, 2008 in the 13th inning against the Chicago White Sox, he faced one batter and picked up the win. He spent the rest of the season with the Orioles, appearing in 28 games.
Castillo split the 2009 season between the Orioles and Norfolk, and began 2010 with the Tides as well. Castillo was recalled to the majors shortly thereafter, but on June 10 Castillo was designated for assignment to make room on the Orioles' roster for Jake Arrieta. He was then returned to Norfolk, where he finished the season. He was granted free agency on October 5, 2010. He was re-signed by the Orioles to a minor league contract in December 2010. After appearing in 20 games for Norfolk, he was granted free agency on June 15, 2011.
Arizona Diamondbacks.
On June 18, 2011 the Arizona Diamondbacks signed Castillo to a minor league deal. He had his contract purchased on June 28. He appeared in 17 games with a 2.31 ERA for the Diamondbacks and then became a free agent on October 21.
Los Angeles Dodgers.
He signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2012 season. On March 18 he was released.

Chancellor's Residence (University of Pittsburgh)

The Chancellor's Residence at the University of Pittsburgh is a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark in Shadyside just east of the main Oakland campus approximately one half mile from the center of campus at the Cathedral of Learning and adjacent to the rear property of the University Child Development Center on the Oakland-Shadyside border in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Architecture.
The residence is the former Harvey Childs house built by Peabody & Stearns in 1896. It is an example of Colonial Revival, with the gambrel roof especially suggestive of New England Colonial. However, the home also incorporates some details reminiscent of Philadelphia's Georgian-style Mount Pleasant mansion. The structure overcomes what was at the time an architectural problem of including a porch that Pittsburghers wanted, but preventing the porch from obscuring the facade toward the street. The design of this house worked around this problem by placing the porch to the side of the house, balanced by a porte-cochere. A renovation designed by Landmark Design Associates later enclosed the porch at the Chancellor's Residence.
History.
Harvey Childs, the original owner for whom the residence is sometimes named, was one of the three Pittsburgh citizens that played a role in the origins of the Allegheny Observatory and thus the early years of University's Department of Astronomy and Physics. He also served as a trustee to the university, then called the Western University of Pennsylvania, from 1863 to 1876. The residence was also the home of John F. Casey, a University of Pittsburgh Trustee until his death in 1948. The home was given to the university to serve as a residence for its chancellor in 1966 by Leon Falk, Jr. who served as vice chairman of the university's Board of Trustees. Pitt's previous chancellor's residence was on Morehead Heights in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and was sold to the Catholic Institute of Pittsburgh proceeding Falk's gift.

Palladists

Palladists is a name for an alleged Theistic Satanist society or member of that society. The name Palladian comes from Pallas and refers to wisdom and learning. It is of no relation to the palladian style of Andrea Palladio.
History.
In 1891 Léo Taxil (Gabriel Jogand-Pagès) and Adolphe Ricoux claimed to have discovered a Palladian Society. An 1892 French book "Le Diable au XIXe siècle" (The Devil in the 19th Century", 1892), written by "Dr. Bataille" (actually Jogand-Pagès himself) alleged that Palladists were Satanists based in Charleston, South Carolina headed by the American Freemason Albert Pike and created by the Italian liberal patriot and author, Giuseppe Mazzini.
Arthur Edward Waite, debunking the existence of the group in "Devil-Worship in France, or The Question of Lucifer", ch. II: "The Mask of Masonry" (London, 1896), reports that according to "the works of Domenico Margiotta and Dr Bataille" that "The Order of Palladium founded in Paris 20 May 1737 or Sovereign Council of Wisdom" was a "Masonic diabolic order". Dr. Bataille asserted that women would supposedly be initiated as "Companions of Penelope". According to Dr. Bataille, the society had two orders, "Adelph" and "Companion of Ulysses", however the society was broken up by French law enforcement a few years after its foundation. 
A supposed Diana Vaughan published "Confessions of an Ex-Palladist" in 1895. On April 19, 1897 Léo Taxil called a press conference at which, he claimed, he would introduce Diana Vaughan to the press. At the conference instead he announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were fictitious. He thanked the Catholic clergy for their assistance in giving publicity to his wild claims.
Media.
The Palladists are the name of the Greenwich Village Satanist society in Val Lewton's film "The Seventh Victim".
The Palladists play a major role in the latter part of Umberto Eco's novel The Prague Cemetery (2011).

Eleanor Saffran

Eleanor M. Saffran (1938-2002) was a researcher in the field of Cognitive Neuropsychology. Her interest in Neuropsychology began at the Baltimore City hospitals of Johns Hopkins University, where her research unit focussed on neurological patients with language or cognitive impairments. In papers published between 1976 and 1982, Dr. Saffran spelled out the methodological tenets of “cognitive neuropsychology” exemplified in her studies of aphasia, Alexia (acquired dyslexia), Auditory verbal agnosia, and short-term memory impairment.
Career.
In 1980, Eleanor joined the Neurology Department of Temple University and established the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. Here she built an interdisciplinary research group composed of neurologists, psychologists, and speech-language pathologists. Under her leadership, this group extended the cognitive neuropsychological approach to the analysis of neurological disorders of perception, visual attention, and semantics.
These years also marked the continuation of her longstanding collaboration with Myrna Schwartz of Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute (part of the Einstein Healthcare Network) which began in Baltimore in 1975. An innovative aspect of their research was its emphasis on application of language theory to diagnosis and treatment of language disorders. This model was embraced by other researchers of language and remains a standard approach in aphasia research today. As the field of cognitive neuropsychology matured, Eleanor became recognized as one of its most influential practitioners. In 1989, her grant on the psycholinguistic analysis of language disorders was awarded the Claude Pepper Award of Excellence by the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders.
In 1991, Eleanor was appointed as Professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Temple University. She continued teaching her courses even after progression of a degenerative condition had weakened her speaking voice and use of her hands. Her contributions to research were recognized posthumously when she was awarded the Temple University Faculty Research Award for excellence in research in 2003.
Legacy.
Longtime colleague Nadine Martin, Associate Professor of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Temple University, started working with Dr. Eleanor M. Saffran in 1982 and then completed her Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology at Temple University in 1987. Today she continues Dr. Saffran's tradition of scholarship and mentorship as Director of the Eleanor M. Saffran Center for Cognitive Neuroscience.
Her daughter Jenny Saffran has also pursued a career in research in cognitive science. Currently she leads the Infant Learning Laboratory at University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Ibaraki dialect

The Ibaraki dialect (Shinjitai: 茨城弁, Kyujitai: 茨城辯 "Ibaraki-ben") is a Japanese dialect spoken in Ibaraki Prefecture.
Ibaraki-ben is characterized by "dakuten" insertion, effecting a voiced syllable. For example, "byōki" (病気 "illness") becomes something like "byōgi". By contraries, "g" sometimes becomes "k" and "b" sometimes becomes "p". For example, "yugata"(夕方 "evening") is pronunciated as "yukada" and "zabuton"(座布団"cushion") is pronunciated as "zapton" by some speakers. Another characteristic of the dialect in many areas is a decreased distinction between "i" and "e" sounds, so that "iro enpitsu" (色鉛筆 "colored pencil") becomes "ero inpitsu" among many speakers.
The final particles -"ppe", -"be", and -"he" are perhaps most well-known. They derive from literary "beshi" (now "beki" in standard Japanese). The pitch accent of the Ibaraki dialect is also fairly different from standard Japanese, typically rising at the end of statements and falling in questions.

<doc id="18587447" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18587447" title="Tokyo dialect">
Tokyo dialect

Overview.
Traditional dialects in downtown Tokyo are generally classified in two groups, and . The Yamanote dialect is characteristic of the old upper-class from the Yamanote area. Standard Japanese was based on the Yamanote dialect during the Meiji period. The Shitamachi dialect is a more working-class dialect, and it preserves features of Edo Chōnin (Edokko) speech, so also called . Tokyo style rakugo is typically played in the Shitamachi dialect. One can compare Yamanote dialect and Shitamachi dialect to the British RP and Cockney in English.
The origin of the Tokyo dialect dates back to Tokugawa Ieyasu's establishment of Edo. This, in part, caused large groups of people, speaking a range of dialects, to migrate across the country. The Kyoto dialect was the de facto standard of the time and strongly influenced the Edo dialect in the early Edo period; the dialect grew inside the largest city in Japan and became the new de facto standard Japanese in the late Edo period. Because of its unique history, especially in relation to the Kyoto dialect, Tokyo is a language island in the Kantō region. For example, traditional Kanto dialects have been characterized by the use of volitional and presumptive suffix -"be", which is rarely used in Tokyo.
Phonology.
The Shitamachi dialect is primarily known for its lack of distinction between some phonemes which are considered wholly distinct in standard Japanese. Most famous is the neutralization of and , so that "shiohigari" ("shellfish gathering") becomes "shioshigari" and "shichi" ("seven") becomes "hichi". Another famous one is the fronting of to , so that Shinjuku becomes "Shinjiku" and "shujutsu" ("operation") becomes "shijitsu".
Another notable trait is the monophthongization of to in the Shitamachi dialect. For example, "hidoi" ("terrible") become "shidee" and "taihen da" ("It's serious") become "teehen da". This feature is inherited in standard Japanese as informal masculine speech like "wakan'nee" (< "wakaranai" "I don't know") and "sugee" (< "sugoi" "great").
In addition, is realized as a trill , when conveying a vulgar nuance in Shitamachi speech. In informal speech, intervocalic is often changed to or sokuon such as "okaerinasai" becomes "okaen'nasai" ("welcome back home") and "sō suru to" becomes "sō sutto" ("then, and so").
Pitch accent.
A few words are pronounced different pitch accent between Yamanote and Shitamachi. The following words are typical examples.
Grammar.
Most of the grammatical features of the Tokyo dialect are identical to the colloquial form of standard Japanese like examples mentioned in "Colloquial contractions" in the article "Japanese grammar". Noticeable earmarks of the Tokyo dialect include the frequent use of interjectory particle "sa", which is roughly analogous to "like" as used in American English slang; "tsū" (common style) and "tee" (Shitamachi style) in place of "to iu" ("to say" or "is called"); the frequent use of emphasis sentence-final particle "dai" or "dee" in Shitamachi, which is famous for a typical Shitamachi verbal shot "teyandee!" (< "o itte iyagaru n dai!", "What are you talking about!?").
Historically, Kanto dialects lacked "keigo" (honorific speech). However, because of its connection with Kyoto and urbanize with stratified society, the Tokyo dialect now has a refined keigo system. The Yamanote dialect is primarily known for an extreme use of keigo and the keigo copula "zamasu" or "zāmasu", sometimes "zansu", derived from "gozaimasu". The feminine courtesy imperative mood "asobase" or "asubase" is also a well-known keigo word from the traditional Tokyo dialect. For example, "Won't you please wait for me?" translates to for "o-machi kudasai" in standard Japanese, and "o-machi asobase" in traditional Tokyo dialect.
Vocabulary.
Though it also includes a few distinctive words, today it is largely indistinguishable from the standard speech of Tokyo other than the phonemic difference. Famous Shitamachi words are a swearword "berabōme!" or "beranmee!" (masculine Shitamachi speech is commonly known as "Beranmee kuchō" or "Beranmee tone"), "atabō" for "atarimae" meaning "of course" and an emphasis prefix "o + sokuon" such as "oppajimeru" for "hajimeru" meaning "to start" and so on. "Atashi" is a feminine first person pronoun in standard Japanese, but in Shitamachi dialect, it is often used by both men and women.
New Tokyo dialect.
Traditional Tokyo dialects are now barely used as most families living in Tokyo speak standard Japanese. The distinction between Shitamachi and Yamanote is now almost extinct.
Historically, many people flocked to Tokyo from other regions, and sometimes brought their dialects into Tokyo with them. For example, "jan" (じゃん), which is a contraction of "ja nai ka" ("isn't that right?") came from the eastern Chūbu and Kanagawa dialectsm and "chigakatta", which is a non-standard form of "chigatta" ("it was different") came from the Fukushima and Tochigi dialects.

CLOUD

Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets or the CLOUD is an experiment being run at CERN by Jasper Kirkby to investigate the microphysics between galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and aerosols under controlled conditions. The experiment began operation in November 2009.
The experiment consists of a 3 m diameter aerosol chamber which is exposed to an adjustable particle beam that simulates GCRs at any altitude or latitude. The chamber is filled with air, water vapour, selected trace gases and can be operated at any temperature or pressure found in the atmosphere. UV illumination allows photolytic reaction. The chamber contains an electric field cage to control the drift of small ions and charged aerosols.
CERN posted a 2009 progress report on the CLOUD project. J. Kirkby (2009) reviews developments in the CERN CLOUD project and planned tests. He describes cloud nucleation mechanisms which appear energetically favourable and depend on GCRs.
On 24 August 2011, preliminary research published in the journal Nature showed there was a connection between Cosmic Rays and aerosol nucleation. Kirkby went on to say in the definitive CERN press Release "Ion‐enhancement is particularly pronounced in the cool temperatures of the mid‐troposphere and above, where CLOUD has found that sulphuric acid and water vapour can nucleate without the need for additional vapours. This result leaves open the possibility that cosmic rays could also influence climate. However, it is premature to conclude that cosmic rays have a significant influence on climate until the additional nucleating vapours have been identified, their ion enhancement measured, and the ultimate effects on clouds have been confirmed.

Sarmin () is a town in northwestern Syria, administratively part of the Idlib Governorate, located 15 kilometers southeast of Idlib. It has an altitude of about 390 meters. Nearby localities include Binnish to the north, Talhiyah to the northeast, Iffis to the east, Saraqib to the southeast and al-Nayrab to the south. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Sarmin had a population of 14,530 in the 2004 census. It is the only locality in the Sarmin "nahiyah" ("subdistrict"). Its inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims.
History.
Medieval period.
Sarmin was the site of a major military confrontation between the Crusaders and the Seljuk Turks. In the thirteenth century the town was celebrated, though small, and the inhabitants were Ismalites, according to Yaqut al-Hamawi. The Ayyubid ruler of Hama and scholar Abu'l-Fida described Sarmin as a town with much land and dependencies, with very fertile soil. The town had no walls, and a Jami mosque. In 1355 Sarmin was visited by Ibn Batutah, who wrote of the abundance of trees, mostly olives, growing there. Soap-making was much practiced, and their "Brick Soap" was exported to Damascus and Cairo. In addition, a perfumed soap, coloured red and yellow, was produced. Cotton products were also made. At this time there was a fine mosque in Sarmin, with nine domes.
Syrian civil war.
It has been shelled during the Syrian civil war, with one of its mosques being severely damaged.

<doc id="18587504" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18587504" title="Lithium titanate">
Lithium titanate

Lithium titanate (full name lithium metatitanate) is a compound containing lithium and titanium. It is an off-white powder at room temperature and has the chemical formula Li2TiO3.
It is the anode component of the fast recharging Lithium-titanate battery. It is also used as an additive in porcelain enamels and ceramic insulating bodies based on titanates. It is preferred as a flux due to its stability.
Crystallization.
The most common crystallization of Li2TiO3 is a monoclinic system. A monoclinic system of crystallization is defined as three unequal axes with one oblique intersection.
The stable monoclinic polymorph is also known as β-Li2TiO3. Additionally a high temperature cubic phase exhibiting solid-solution type behavior is referred to as γ-Li2TiO3 and is known to form reversibly above temperatures in the range 1150°-1250°C. A metastable cubic phase, isostructural with γ-Li2TiO3 is referred to as α-Li2TiO3 and is known to form from low temperature synthesis procedures and transforms to the stable β phase at temperatures around 400°C. 
Uses in sintering.
The sintering process is taking a powder, putting it into a mold and heating it to below its melting point. Sintering is based on atomic diffusion, the atoms in the powder particle diffuse into surrounding particles eventually forming a solid or porous material.
It has been discovered that Li2TiO3 powders have a high purity and good sintering ability.
Uses as a cathode.
Molten carbonate fuel cells.
Lithium titanate is used as a cathode in layer one of a double layer cathode for molten carbonate fuel cells. These fuel cells have two material layers, layer 1 and layer 2, which allow for the production of high power molten carbonate fuel cells that work more efficiently.
Lithium ion batteries.
Li2TiO3 is used in the cathode of some lithium-ion batteries, along with an aqueous binder and a conducting agent. Li2TiO3 is used because it is capable of stabilizing the high capacity cathode conducting agents; LiMO2 (M=Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni). Li2TiO3 and the conduction agents (LiMO2) are layered in order to create the cathode material. These layers allow for the occurrence of lithium diffusion.
Lithium-titanate battery.
The lithium-titanate battery is a rechargeable battery that is much faster to charge than other lithium-ion batteries. It differs from other lithium-ion batteries because it uses lithium-titanate on the anode surface rather than carbon. This is advantageous because it does not create an SEI layer (Solid Electrolyte Interface), which acts as a barrier to the ingress and egress of Li-ion to and from the anode. This allows lithium-titanate batteries to be recharged more quickly and provide higher currents when necessary. A disadvantage of the lithium-titanate battery is a much lower capacity and voltage than the conventional lithium-ion battery. The lithium-titanate battery is currently being used in battery electric vehicles and other specialist applications.
Synthesis of lithium titanate breeder powder.
Li2TiO3 powder is most commonly prepared by the mixing of Lithium carbonate, Ti-nitrate solution, and citric acid followed by calcination, compaction, and sintering. The nanocrystalline material created is used as a breeder powder due to its high purity and activity.
Tritium breeding.
Fusion reactions in ITER are fueled by tritium and deuterium. Tritium resources are extremely limited, currently estimated at twenty kilos. Lithium can be used as a solid breeder material of tritium in the blanket of fusion reactions in ITER. Tritium is produced by the neutrons leaving the plasma and interacting with lithium in the blanket. Li2TiO3 along with Li4SiO4 are attractive as tritium breeding materials because they exhibit high tritium release, low activation, and chemical stability.
Lithium titanate aerogel.
In order to advance the lithium ion battery, lithium titanate aerogel (of composition Li4Ti5O12) is currently being investigated as an effective anode material.

Stackhat

The Stackhat, originally designed as a generic sport safety helmet by CIG (Commonwealth Industrial Gases, now BOC) and then developed by Rosebank, was a bicycle helmet widely available in Australia in the 1980s. Due to government regulations and promotion by various State governments, the sturdy bright orange Stackhat had a near monopoly on bicycle helmets in the country for teenagers and children. Its distinctive design, initial release in a bright orange colour, ubiquitous ownership in the 1980s, and fast disappearance in the 1990s, have combined to make "The Stackhat" a defining symbol of the 1980s for Australians. While the variety of helmet colours expanded throughout the years, the design did not.
Background.
Australia was the first country to introduce national standards for bicycle helmet safety. The Stackhat was one of the first helmets to meet that proposed standard and was promoted heavily by State governments. An imaginative and colourful television campaign featuring Molly Meldrum riding through an early computer-generated model of the Sydney Harbour Bridge also cemented the helmet in popular imagination.
Appearance.
The sturdy Stackhat was designed to emphasise safety over aerodynamics. Its appearance was more like something a crash test dummy would wear than an elite cyclist. This aesthetic was a selling point for the various governments promoting the device to safety-conscious parents.
The Stackhat is designed to protect the skull and temple and is light, comfortable, colourful and streamlined. The 'hi-tech' graphics are designed to appeal to the youth market. Made from impact-modified and shock absorbent expanded polystyrene it is designed for use in sporting and leisure activities including cycling, cricket, equestrian and skiing.
The Stackhat is significant as it was one of the first helmets designed in Australia to comply with the Australian Standard 2063.
The helmet was initially only available in orange but after several years other colours, including black, white and pink became available.
Naming.
The Stackhat derives its name from the verb "to stack", which means "to crash".
Cultural references.
References to the Stackhat in Australian popular culture include The Red Paintings' 2004 song "The World's About to End, Don't Forget to Wear Your Stackhat" and Rosie Burgess's 2010 song "Stackhat".

Temple Beth Israel () was a synagogue located at 905 College Avenue in Niagara Falls, New York. Founded in 1898 and formally incorporated in 1905 as an Orthodox synagogue, it hired its first rabbi in 1916, and joined the Conservative movement in 1931.
The congregation moved to its most recent building in 1967, and soon afterwards membership peaked at over 180 families, but by 2008 had been reduced to 50. From 2005 to 2007 the synagogue was repeatedly targeted by vandals; after some of these incidents a federal investigation was started and two people were arrested, convicted, and sentenced.
Samuel Porrath served as rabbi from 1931 to 1934, and, though employed elsewhere, would subsequently often serve as interim rabbi; he was appointed "rabbi emeritus" in 1968. Melvin Kieffer was the congregation's longest serving rabbi, from 1947 to 1957. Haim Cassorla, Beth Israel's last rabbi, served from 1988 to 1995. In the 2000s, its president was Dr. Lawrence Wolfgang. In May 2011 the congregation stated it would disband by the end of the year.
Early history.
Founded in Niagara Falls in 1898, Temple Beth Israel formally incorporated in 1905, when it was granted a charter by the State of New York, and purchased land for $1,600 ($ today) on Cedar Avenue. Construction of a building did not start until 1911, when the cornerstone was laid. At the time the congregation had 33 members. The building was completed in 1912 at a cost of approximately $12,000 ($ today) of which half was borrowed as a mortgage. Jacob Schiff, the New York City philanthropist, donated $250 towards the costs. Annual dues averaged around $17 ($ today).
In its early years Beth Israel could not afford a rabbi, Sunday School, or Hebrew school; High Holiday services were run by guest rabbis, and the rabbi of Niagara Falls' Temple Beth El would help out. In 1915 Beth Israel started providing Hebrew school classes, and in 1916 hired its first full-time rabbi, Moses Abramson, who served until 1918. Subsequent rabbis were Abraham Helfman (1919–1922), Israel Holtzman (1923–1924), and Alter Abelson (1925–1926).
During Abelson's final year at Beth Israel the congregation opened a permanently organized Sunday School; prior to that classes had not been "on a steady or permanently organized basis". Abelson was followed by Jacob Landy (1927–1928) and Isser Muskat (1928–1930).
1930s, 40s, and 50s.
Though the synagogue had always called itself Orthodox, it also had liberal leanings, and in 1931 it affiliated itself with the United Synagogue of America (now United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism). That year Beth Israel hired Samuel I. Porrath as rabbi, a position he would hold until 1935. Porrath subsequently moved away from Niagara Falls, but would eventually return. Though employed elsewhere (including Temple Beth El in Buffalo, New York, and Niagara University, where he chaired the Institute of Transportation, Travel and Tourism), he would often serve as Beth Israel's interim rabbi when the congregation was between permanent rabbis. A founder of Niagara County Community College, Porrath was appointed Beth Israel's "Rabbi Emeritus" in 1968, and died in 1989.
After Porrath, Beth Israel went through another series of short-tenured rabbis: Jacob Friedman (1936–1937), Herman Glatt (1938–1940), and Mordecai Waxman (1941–1942). Waxman would subsequently serve as an Army chaplain in World War II, go on to become a prominent rabbi in the Conservative movement, and serve as rabbi of Temple Israel of Great Neck, New York from 1947 to his death in 2002. Waxman was followed by Simon Shoop (1942–1943), Philip Miller (1943–1944), and Jay Kaufman (1945–1946).
The congregation began work on an addition to the synagogue in 1947, which it completed in 1948. The total cost was $30,000, of which $20,000 was raised, and $10,000 borrowed.
In 1947 Beth Israel also hired Melvin Kieffer; he served until 1957, the synagogue's longest serving rabbi, and during his tenure, in 1955, Beth Israel's mortgage was finally paid off. Kieffer was followed by Seymour Schorr, who was hired in 1958.
New building.
By 1965 the congregation had approximately 175 families, and had outgrown its building on Cedar Avenue, which had inadequate facilities, and too few (and unsafe) classrooms. In 1961 Beth Israel had acquired from the New York Power Authority of land at College Avenue and Madison Avenue, valued at approximately $100,000, in exchange for of land the Authority needed in Beth Israel's cemetery. Funds were raised for a new building, and in 1966 construction began on facilities on College Avenue. The work was completed in time for High Holiday services to be held there in 1967.
That year Schorr asked to be released from his contract, and was replaced by Morris A. Cohen for 6 months, and then Samuel Porrath, who came out of retirement to assist. In 1968 Yosel I. Dick was hired as rabbi; he would serve until 1971. Membership peaked at over 180 families soon after the move to the new building.
Decline.
During the 1970s Niagara Falls had entered a long economic downturn: plants run by major employers closed, and the city's population dropped by over 40 percent. Jewish employees were laid off when the plants closed, and many Jewish businesses moved or went out of business. Jewish families left the area, and synagogue membership declined. During this period Israel Zimmerman was rabbi from 1972–1975, and Lawrence Pinsker, a graduate of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, from 1976 to 1980.
Jerome Kestenbaum joined as rabbi in 1981, and, feeling that the mortgage was a drain on the congregation, in 1982 he and synagogue president Samuel Wineburgh asked Jack A. Gellman to head a campaign to retire it. The original mortgage for the new building had been $350,000, and by 1982 the balance remaining was $42,000. The campaign was a success, and a mortgage burning dinner was held in October of that year.
Kestenbaum was replaced by Bruce Adler in 1983; Adler had just been ordained at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. He served for a year, moving to Beth Israel Synagogue of Hamilton, Ohio. In 1985 Kestenbaum returned, serving until 1986, when he was replaced by David Harary.
Haim Cassorla replaced Harary in 1988; when he left, in 1995, the congregation could not afford to hire a replacement. Dr. Laurence Boxer acted in place of a rabbi, without remuneration, conducting all services and grave-side rituals. By 1998 Beth Israel's membership had dropped to 65 families, and by 2008 membership was 50 families. In the 2000s, Beth Israel's president was Dr. Lawrence Wolfgang.
From 1978 on the temple held an annual fundraising dinner which, by 2011, typically raised $10,000. In May of that year the congregation stated it would donate all proceeds of the 2011 fundraising dinner to the Catholic Mount Saint Mary's Hospital in Lewiston, and disband by the end of the year. The members bestowed the annual fundraising event on the hospital's foundation.
Targeted by vandals.
In 1992 swastikas and the words "white power" were found on synagogue's door, which was urinated on, and in 1997 vandals started a fire outside the building. However, a more sustained set of attacks started in 2005 and escalated in the summer and fall of 2006. Incidents occurred on a near-daily basis, and included urinating on the synagogue's doors and carving swastikas into them: a "skateboard club" named "DNA" had apparently claimed the Temple's property as its own "turf", and refused to leave. A federal investigation involving a Joint Terrorism Task Force agent and local police was begun when the message "Kill the Jews" was duct-taped to the building's door on January 12, 2007. The investigation was hampered because witnesses were afraid to speak, in fear of retaliation.
In February 2007 two people, one a juvenile, were arrested and charged in connection with the incidents. The suspects initially pleaded not guilty, but in early June were offered a plea bargain, and later that month Shawn M. Blount pleaded guilty to the vandalism. In August he was sentenced to one to three years in prison, and a co-defendant, who also pleaded guilty, was sentenced as a youthful offender to one year in Niagara County Jail. At the synagogue's annual "Friends of Temple Beth Israel" dinner it honored that year the police officers and attorneys who prosecuted the perpetrators, and honored the following year the parish council president of St. Teresa Catholic Church and the founders of the Niagara Falls Human Rights Commission for helping raise awareness of the crimes.

Congregation Beth Israel (New Orleans)

Congregation Beth Israel () is a Modern Orthodox synagogue located in Louisiana. Founded in 1903 or 1904, though tracing its roots back to 1857, it is the oldest Orthodox congregation in the New Orleans region. Originally located on Carondelet Street in New Orleans' Central City, it constructed and moved to a building at 7000 Canal Boulevard in Lakeview, New Orleans in 1971.
At one time the largest Orthodox congregation in the Southern United States, its membership was over 500 families in the 1960s, but fell to under 200 by 2005. That year its Canal Boulevard building was severely flooded by the 2005 New Orleans levee failure disaster during Hurricane Katrina. Despite attempts to save them, all seven of its Torah scrolls were destroyed, as were over 3,000 prayer-books. The building suffered further flooding damage caused by the theft of copper air-conditioning tubing in 2007.
In the wake of Katrina another 50 member families left New Orleans, including the rabbi's. The congregation began sharing space with Gates of Prayer, a Reform synagogue in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. By 2009, the congregation had purchased land from Gates of Prayer, and intended to build a new synagogue next to it.
The congregation shared space in Gates of Prayer's building from 2010 until August 2012, when a new building was dedicated at 4004 West Esplanade Avenue in Metairie. The rabbi is Uri Topolsky.
History.
Beth Israel is the oldest Orthodox congregation in the New Orleans region, and its most prominent. Though it was founded as early as 1903, it traces its roots back to much older synagogues. In the mid-19th century New Orleans had a number of small Orthodox congregations of Eastern European Jews, generally "structured along nationalistic lines". These included a synagogue of Galitzianer Jews (Chevra Thilim), and two of Lithuanian Jews, (one—Chevra Mikve Israel—following the non-Hassidic liturgy, the other—Anshe Sfard—following the Hassidic liturgy). In 1857, a congregation consisting primarily of Prussian Jews from Posen organized as Tememe Derech, "The Right Way". As they followed the Polish rite, they were known as "The Polish Congregation".
Tememe Derech built a synagogue in the 500 block of Carondelet Street in the Central City section of New Orleans in 1867. It was the sole Orthodox congregation to construct its own building; only a minority of New Orleans' Jews were Orthodox, and other congregations rented space or met in members' homes. Tememe Derech's membership, however, never exceeded 50, and in 1903 or 1904 the synagogue disbanded, and merged with a number of other small Orthodox congregations and a burial society to form Beth Israel. Services were initially held in rented quarters in the same 500 block of Carondelet Street.
In 1905, Beth Israel purchased the home of New Orleans' former mayor Joseph A. Shakspeare at 1610 Carondelet Street. Funds for the new acquisition came from both the Orthodox and Reform communities of New Orleans. After remodeling the building, the congregation began holding services there, in time for the 1906 High Holy Days. Membership grew quickly; by 1910 Beth Israel was the second-largest Jewish congregation in the city, with 180 member families, and by 1914 that number had grown to 250 families. By 1918, however, membership had fallen to 175 families. That year the synagogues income was $6,000 (today $).
Moses Hyman Goldberg was the congregation's first rabbi, but within a year he moved to Chevra Thilim. Goldberg served as New Orleans' "mohel" until his death in 1940.
Beth Israel rebuilt its synagogue at the Carondelet Street location in 1924. The new building was designed by Emil Weil, a noted Southern architect, particularly of Jewish religious buildings. He designed other New Orleans' synagogues, including the Touro Synagogue and the Anshe Sfard, as well as other non-religious buildings throughout Louisiana. Beth Israel's new Byzantine Revival building, with its seating capacity of 1,200, reflected "the growing economic and social confidence of the membership": it had "beautiful" stained-glass windows, a "magnificent" imported European chandelier, and "hand-carved Stars of David in the ceiling". The building was dedicated on September 12, and a Boston rabbi, Henry Raphael Gold, was a guest speaker. He was so impressed that he stayed on, becoming Beth Israel's rabbi.
In 1926 Beth Israel built the "Menorah Institute" Talmud Torah building on Euterpe Street, adjoining the Carondelet synagogue. The school, which served as an Orthodox alternative to the existing Communal Hebrew School, comprised a nursery school, a Hebrew school, and a Sunday school. The building also housed Beth Israel's offices, and the "Little Shul" ("shul" is the Yiddish word for synagogue), where services were held twice a day.
The congregation leased land for burials in the Chevra Thilim Cemetery on Canal Street, a site that had been used by Tememe Derech as early as 1860, and which was shared with several other congregations. In the 1930s Beth Israel purchased its own cemetery on Frenchmen Street.
Uri Miller joined Beth Israel as rabbi in 1935, a post he would hold through the early 1940s. He was president of the Hebrew Theological College Alumni from 1936 to 1938, and of its successor the Rabbinical Council of America from 1946 to 1948.
During Miller's tenure the synagogue's neighborhood began to deteriorate. Members started moving uptown, and the congregation embarked on a search for a new location. In 1963 Beth Israel purchased a block of land at 7000 Canal Boulevard at Walker Street in the Lakeview neighborhood. It moved into its new larger building there in 1971.
From 1914 through World War II Beth Israel described itself the "largest Orthodox congregation in the South", and in the 1960s it had 500 member families. By 2005, however, that number had been reduced to fewer than 200. Nevertheless, Beth Israel still held services twice a day, the only synagogue in New Orleans to do so.
Hurricane Katrina and aftermath.
As a result of the Federal levee failure disaster, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after attempts were made to save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.
Despite Leider's efforts, all seven Torah scrolls were unsalvageable, and had to be buried. They had initially been buried in her backyard by Rebecca Heggelund, Beth Israel's non-Jewish secretary, who first received them after their rescue, and were subsequently re-buried next to the grave of Beth Israel's "gabbai" Meyer Lachoff. Lachoff had died just after Katrina, but could not be buried in New Orleans until months later.
In addition to losing all of its Torah scrolls, Beth Israel lost all its furniture, and over 3,000 "siddurs" and "mahzors", and almost all of its members' homes were flooded, forcing them to move. The congregation did, however, receive assistance in replacing some of its assets; the Orthodox Union immediately sent Beth Israel 50 ArtScroll "siddurs", and Brith Shalom Beth Israel Congregation of Charleston, South Carolina, and Congregation Shaare Zedek Sons of Abraham of Providence, Rhode Island each donated Torahs. Hayley Fields, a 14-year-old from Los Angeles, heard of Beth Israel's difficult circumstances, and with the support of her mother, spearheaded a fund-raising drive, selling 3,500 watches. $18,000 was ultimately raised to buy a Torah, which was dedicated in August, 2006, two days before the first anniversary of the hurricane. At that ceremony the National Council of Young Israel also donated 150 new Artscoll "mahzor"s, in time for the High Holy Days.
In the wake of Katrina 50 families that were members of Beth Israel left New Orleans, and gave up membership in the congregation. These included Rabbi Schiff and his family. After the flood Beth Israel's board of directors informed Schiff, who had joined they synagogue in April 2002, that it would not be able to meet its contractual obligations and pay him past December. Schiff and his family had also lost their home and much of their possessions, and had been living in Memphis. Schiff resigned effective November 1, 2005, citing this loss, and the lack of a functioning Jewish Day School in the area for his children.
Soon after the flood, Beth Israel received an offer to temporarily use space from Congregation Gates of Prayer, a Reform synagogue in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. The congregation began holding weekly services and renting office space there.
In 2006 it was unclear if Beth Israel, which had already been in difficult financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, to a depth of three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.
Recent events.
In 2007, the congregation began some joint programming with Anshe Sefard, New Orleans' only other remaining Orthodox synagogue, and in the summer hired Uri Topolsky as its new rabbi. A graduate of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Topolsky had previously served as the associate rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, and had been one of 21 rabbis arrested at the United Nations during an April 2007 sit-in demanding that Iran be expelled from the U.N.
To help attract new members, in the summer Topolsky started a recruitment campaign, placing an advertisement in the New York newspaper "The Jewish Week", and re-designing Beth Israel's website. The campaign's tagline was "If you believe in the ability to destroy, you can believe in the ability to rebuild", a saying of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, and by the end of October ten new members had joined. However, while all New Orleans synagogues lost membership after Katrina, as of 2007, Beth Israel was the only New Orleans synagogue that had not re-opened in its former location.
Topolsky and Gates of Prayer's rabbi Robert Loewy also began learning together on Fridays, and the two congregations started scheduling joint programs. Though these programs were generally secular in nature (e.g. "Israeli film series, Hebrew literacy programs and Jewish history classes"), they also tried to co-ordinate some religious programs to the extent that ritual differences would permit. For example, for the pre-Rosh Hashanah "selichot" service they held a joint concert, then worshiped separately.
Beth Israel started "The Minyan Project" in 2008, an effort to attract 10 (see "minyan") new Orthodox families to New Orleans. The families were given "generous financial assistance", and in return had to "commit to providing community service, from maintaining the eruv enclosure that's due to be completed within the month to assisting in kosher supervision at a local supermarket." According to Topolsky, with the move of four new families to the area, New Orleans likely had proportionately the fastest growing Modern Orthodox community in the United States. In April of that year the Orthodox Union gave the congregation $235,000 towards a new building. At the time, Beth Israel had 80 member families, and 80 "associate member" families (families who belonged to other synagogues as well).
By 2009, the congregation had decided to erect a new synagogue on land it had purchased from Gates of Prayer, part of the lot on which the Gates of Prayer synagogue stood. For the 2009 High Holy Days, Topolsky planned to launch a capital campaign to raise $1 million towards the construction of the building.
Beth Israel shared the Gates of Prayer building at 4000 West Esplanade Avenue in Metairie from 2010 until the construction and dedication of a new synagogue. The rabbi is Uri Topolosky.

Dornier Aerodyne

The Dornier Aerodyne was the designation of an unmanned "wingless" VTOL aircraft. Conceived by Alexander Lippisch, it was developed and built by Dornier on behalf of the Federal German Ministry of Defense. Lippisch was part of the team. The first flight took place on 18 September 1972. The development ended on 30 November 1972 after successful hovering-flight testing with the aircraft. Experimentation did not continue due to lack of interest in the "Bundeswehr" (German Armed Forces), and/or the desire to undertake plans for manned helicopters.
Description.
The principle behind the Aerodyne is the combination of lift and thrust production in a single construction unit and flow channel, i.e. a ducted fan. Flaps at the end of the fan divert the outflowing air to produce lift, thrust, or a combination of both. As a result, the Aerodyne could be steered and flown in the entire range between hovering and full-forward flight.
For forward flight, the Aerodyne had a conventional tail unit at the rear, which allowed for pitch and yaw control. The equipment was unmanned and operated by remote control.
It was intended to be a land- or ship-supported drone (UAV) for aerial reconnaissance.

1949 San Francisco 49ers season

The 1949 AAFC season was the final season before the league folded and comprised only twelve games instead of the previously standard fourteen. The 49ers, in their fourth season, were unable to improve on the previous season's output of 12–2, only posting a record of 9–3, however, they were able to make their first playoff appearance. This was due to the league taking a different format, in which the top four teams played a tournament to determine the champion.
The 49ers, with the second seed, played the third-seeded New York Yankees (8–4). With their 17–7 victory over the Yankees, the 49ers moved on to play the Cleveland Browns in the league championship. The 49ers ended up losing 21–7. Until the 2013 Super Bowl, it is the only time the 49ers lost a league title game.

Sisters of the Gion

The film won 1937 Kinema Junpo Award for the best film (director Kenji Mizoguchi) and an award in Vienna in 1998.
Plot.
The story centers around two sisters (Umekichi and Omocha), who are geisha, living in an okiya of their own in the licensed pleasure district of Gion, Kyoto. The two women have very different outlooks on relationships with men. Umekichi, the elder sister, is the ideal geisha; she grew up going to dance and music lessons, wears kimono, and has a strong sense of giri, or loyalty, to her patron. Umekichi’s younger sister, Omocha, was educated in public schools and wears western clothing, except when she is working as a geisha. Unlike Umekichi, Omocha doesn’t trust men and believes that they will only use geisha and then abandon them without a care. Thus, she uses men to her own advantage. In doing so she is willing to manipulate and lie to her customers.
Umekichi’s patron in the movie is a newly bankrupt businessman named Shimbei Furusawa, who Umekichi takes care of after he loses his house and business. Omocha does not believe that her sister should support Shimbei, that doing so will prevent her from providing for herself by finding a new patron, and that she owes him nothing as, in her view, he has received more than he has given in the past. Omocha finds her sister a new patron and, one day when Umekichi is out, gives Shimbei some money to return to his wife in the country and tells him that her sister no longer wants him around. He takes the money but, rather than leaving, spends it drinking and takes up residence with his former clerk.
Omocha also attempts to find a patron for herself and appears to be successful in gaining the attention of the owner of a kimono/cloth shop. However, in the process of helping her sister Omocha has previously taken advantage of the owner’s clerk, who has stolen from the shop to provide a kimono for Umekichi and been found out.
Umekichi throws over her new patron when she learns of Omocha's deception of Shimbei from the kimono shop clerk, and returns to him. The clerk is discovered at Omocha's okiya by the shop owner and dismissed. He seeks his revenge on his former employer by informing his wife of her husband's infidelity, and then exacts his revenge on Omocha by abducting her in a car and injuring her grievously by throwing her from it.
Omocha and Umekichi have conflicting outlooks on men and the role of geisha, but ultimately they are both defeated at the end of the film. Umekichi is abandoned by her bankrupt patron Shimbei when he is given the chance to manage a factory in the country where his wife has retired, and ends up caring for Omocha after her hospitalization for her injuries. Omocha curses the very existence of the geisha and the sexual subjugation involved. This tragic ending largely confirms Omocha's jaundiced view of the role of the geisha in a male dominated society, in a film that is surprisingly feminist for its time and place.

Eliza Ridgely

Eliza Eichelberger Ridgely (February 10, 1803 – December 20, 1867) was an American heiress, traveler, arbiter of fashion, and mistress of Hampton, the Ridgely plantation north of Towson, Maryland. She is the Lady with a Harp of Thomas Sully's portrait, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.
Background.
Eliza Ridgely was the only child of Nicholas Greenbury Ridgely (1770–1829), a rich wine merchant of Baltimore, who married her mother, Elisabeth Eichelberger, on July 30, 1801. Elizabeth had been born on December 6, 1783, at Baltimore, the daughter of Johann Martin Eichelberger and his wife Elizabeth Welsh, and died on February 10, 1803, aged nineteen years and two months, a few hours after the birth of her only daughter. Nicholas Ridgely died in 1829 and is buried in the cemetery at Hampton. 
Life.
Eliza Ridgely was an heiress who became a foreign traveler and an arbiter of fashion. She met and befriended the Marquis de Lafayette during his United States tour of 1824–1825 and stayed in contact with him for the rest of his life. Some of his letters to her have survived, including an invitation to visit La Grange, his country estate in France—a visit which took place in 1834—and his congratulations on her marriage.
On January 8, 1828, Eliza Ridgely married John Carnan Ridgely (1790–1867). He was the son of Charles Carnan Ridgely of Hampton Mansion, and his father had served as Governor of the state of Maryland from 1815 to 1818. 
John Carnan Ridgely was the grandson of John Carnan who married Achsah Ridgely. Achsah's brother, Charles Ridgely III (d. 1790), the builder of the Hampton plantation being childless as his end neared, willed that his sister's progeny should take the Ridgely name to inherit his vast estates. Thus, John Carnan Ridgely was, in fact, a fifth cousin of Eliza Eichelberger Ridgely. 
On the death of Charles Carnan Ridgely in July 1829, his estate of some was divided, John Carnan Ridgely inheriting the main house and .
Eliza Ridgely thus became the third mistress of Hampton, a great house which when built in 1790 had been the largest private residence in the United States.
With John Carnan Ridgely, she had five children:
Eliza Ridgely had a serious approach to financial affairs. The daughter of a merchant, she had married into a family which recorded the smallest transaction, and she kept careful accounts of all her expenditure, even noting the nine and a half cents she paid for a piece of ribbon. As well as her personal spending, her accounts also show her expenses in ensuring that the Hampton slaves were clothed and shod, a major undertaking. She also recorded her subscriptions, such as those to the Baltimore Humane Impartial Society from 1849 to 1854 and her donations to a Widows Asylum between 1849 and 1851.
Eliza Ridgely ordered church services for her slaves in the attic of the Hampton carriage house. The services were taken by a white minister, Mr Galbraith, until he was dismissed for marrying a woman believed to have African blood. Ridgely herself oversaw funerals and weddings in the house's great hall. One of Ridgely's grandsons, the diplomat Henry White, recalled that she "...was very particular in having what she was pleased to describe (and which I then believed to be) 'marriages', performed by a clergyman, between the negro servants, when so inclined: not realizing – certainly I did not at the time – that slaves were unable to perform any civil act, being mere chattels". Ridgely's daughter Eliza recorded having taught a group of slave children the Lord's Prayer.
Eliza Ridgely was an avid gardener, and in the 1830s and 1840s she improved the gardens and enhanced the landscape at Hampton, planting exotic trees such as the Lebanon Cedar which still stands on the house's south lawn. She is said to have brought this herself as a seedling from Europe, carrying it in a shoebox. She and her husband bought furniture for the house which reflected the classical influences already indulged there. In 1839, the landscape gardener Henry Winthrop Sargent found that Hampton's venerable appearance and foreign air "...quite disturb one's ideas of republican America".
Lady with a Harp.
Thomas Sully's painting "Lady with a Harp" "(pictured)" is a portrait of Eliza Ridgely done in 1818, when she was only fifteen, showing her wearing an Empire satin gown with a draped shawl as she plucks the strings of a pedal harp. It was commissioned by her father, Nicholas Greenbury Ridgely, who at the same time was himself painted by Sully. Eliza really did play the harp, and her surviving bills and receipts include those for music lessons and for the repair of her harp in the years 1820 to 1826. Whether her arms were as long and her figure as slender as they were painted is uncertain. Sully later commented on all his work "From long experience, I know that resemblance in a portrait is essential; but no fault will be found with the artist (at least by the sitter) if he improve the appearance."
The painting was kept at Hampton from the 1820s until 1945, when it was sold to the National Gallery of Art. After David Finley, director of the gallery, had acquired "Lady with a Harp" he became an advocate for the preservation of Hampton. He helped to arrange a deal under which the Ridgelys sold the house to Ailsa Mellon Bruce's Avalon Foundation, which in 1948 gave it to the National Park Service.
There is now a copy of the painting at Hampton.
Surviving papers of Eliza Ridgely.
A number of financial records kept by Eliza Ridgely have been preserved:
Other surviving manuscripts include letters Eliza Ridgely wrote to her daughter Eliza (known as 'Didy') between May 8 and July 12, 1858, a commonplace book of poetry she kept before her marriage, and letters she received from her friend Lafayette, her son Charles at Harvard and her daughter Eliza traveling in Europe.

Remacemide

Remacemide is a drug which acts as a low-affinity NMDA antagonist with sodium channel blocking properties. It has been studied for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease.
Because remacemide has only a modest effect on seizure frequency and causes dizziness, it is no longer believed that remacemide will be an effective treatment for epilepsy. Although no such statement has been made about remacemide's potential for treating stroke, Huntington's, or Parkinson's, remacemide is no longer being developed for these conditions.
Remacemide is also known as remacemide hydrochloride, (±)-2-amino-"N"-(1-methyl-1,2-diphenylethyl)-acetamide hydrochloride, or FPL 12924AA.
Mechanism of action.
Remacemide binds weakly and noncompetitively to the ionic channel site of the NMDA receptor complex. Remacemide binds both allosterically and in the channel. 
However, because remacemide binds so weakly to NMDAR, much of remacemide's "in vivo" effect against excitotoxicity is thought to be caused by its metabolic transformation to the more potent desglycine derivative FPL 12495. That is, remacemide may actually act as a prodrug to deliver the active metabolite FPL 12495 to the central nervous system.
Epilepsy.
Generalized Absence Epilepsy.
In a well validated and described genetic model of absence epilepsy, rats of the WAG/Rij strain, remacemide and its metabolite FPL 12495 were found to have a common for glutamate antagonist usual effect on the number of spike/wave dischargesEEG, the drugs decrease spike/wave dischanges dose dependently. However, in contrast to most other glutamate antagonists, FPL 12495 increased the duration of the spike-wave discharges.
Enantiomers of Remacemide.
The stereoisomer of remacemide is of equal potency to the racemic mixture in preventing maximal electroshock seizures when administered orally to rats, while the (+)stereoisomer is less potent.
Metabolites of Remacemide.
FPL 12495.
Much of remacemide's effect "in vivo" is thought to be caused by the desglycine derivative FPL 12495 (±).
FPL 12495 (±) binds specifically and non-competitively to NMDAR. Its effect on maximal electroconvulsive shock is more potent than remacemide. The (FPL 12859) is even more potent than the racemic mixture, while the R isomer is less potent than the racemate.
FPL 12495 is sometimes referred to as ARL 12495AA.
Other metabolites.
FPL 15053.
FPL 15053 is the "N"-hydroxy-desglycinate of remacemide, and exhibits modest binding to NMDAR and modest effects on convulsions and mortality in test mice and rats.
FPL 14331 and FPL 14465.
FPL 14331 and FPL 14465 are the "p"-hydroxy-desglycinates of remacemide, and they exhibit some efficacy against maximal electroconvulsive shock after i.p. and i.v. dosing.
FPL 15455.
FPL 15455 is an oxoacetate matabolite of remacemide, but has no demonstrated biological activity.
FPL 14991 and FPL 14981.
FPL 14991 and FPL 14981 are both "β"-Miydroxy-desglycinates of remacemide, and they display modest efficacy against maximal electroconvulsive shock in mice. However FPL 14981 and not FPL 14991 prevents NMDLA-induced convulsions and mortality in mice.
FPL 13592 and FPL 15112.
The hydroxy-methyl derivative of remacemide (FPL 13592) and its desglycinate (FPL 15112) prevents electric shock-induced convulsions only after i.v. administration; only the desglycine derivative binds to NMDAR.
FPL 14467.
FPL 14467 ("p"-dihydroxy-desglycine) is inactive "in vivo" and weak in binding NMDAR.
Pharmacodynamics.
The values for 50% displacement of were 68 µM for remacemide and 0.48 µM for FPL 12495AA.
Comparisons to other anticonvulsants.
Preclinical trials in mice showed that remacemide has a lower efficacy than some commercial anticonvulsants and a higher efficacy than others. The median effective dose (ED50) value for oral administration of remacemide was 33 mg/kg (compare to phenytoin = 11, phenobarbital = 20, carbamazepine = 13 and valproate = 631).
Pharmacokinetics.
Crossing the Blood–Brain Barrier.
The brain uptake index (BUI), a measure of a drug's ability to pass the blood–brain barrier that involves the injection of radiolabeled test and reference substances into the common carotid artery of anesthetized animals, for remacemide is 51 ± 0.9 SD.
Adverse effects.
Lack of adverse effects.
Unlike many other treatments for epilepsy, remacemide does not appear to impair cognitive performance or driving performance in humans, although the evidence for effects on cognitive performance in animals has been mixed. 
Remacemide is not a sedative. Despite acting on the same site as phencyclidine (PCP), remacemide is not addictive and is unlikely to cause a drug-abuse problem.
Toxicity.
Remacemide is 
The median toxic dose of remacemide for neural impairment tests in mice is 5.6 mg/kg.
Its estimated median lethal dose is about 927.3 mg/kg in mice.
It has a favorable therapeutic index of 28.1 in mice.
Drug interactions.
Remacemide and Levodopa.
Remacemide delays the absorption of levodopa (300 mg of remacemide one hour before levodopa treatment delays mean time to peak levodopa plasma concentration by 20%) but not its total absorption (area-under-the-curve for levodopa plasma concentration was unchanged).
Remacemide and Sodium Valproate.
Remacemide does not interact with sodium valproate, a treatment for epilepsy.
Remacemide and Carbamazepine.
Ramacemide does interact with carbamazepine. Remacemide inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine, while carbamazepine induces the metabolism of remacemide and FPL 12495.
Completed Clinical Trials.
Parkinson's Disease.
Phase I.
Study of Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between Remacemide And Levodopa.
The first clinical study of remacemide in Parkinson's patients was SPIRAL (Study of Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between Remacemide And Levodopa), a small short-term trial which evaluated whether remacemide affected circulating plasma levdopa concentrations in Parkinson's patients. The purpose of this evaluation was to help guide the interpretation of future clinical trials. As the study found that remacemide delayed levodopa absorption somewhat but did not change average levdopa levels over time, it was concluded that the effect of remacemide on plasma levodopa levels was unlikely to be an important factor in interpreting later clinical studies of remacemide with levdopa-treated patients. The study was begun in 1997 and the results published in 1999.
Phase II.
Remacemide As Monotherapy in Parkinson's Disease.
The RAMP (Remacemide As Monotherapy in Parkinson's Disease) study was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of remacemide as monotherapy in patients with early Parkinson's disease. Two hundred patients with early Parkinson's disease who were not yet receiving levodopa or dopamine agonists were randomized to receive either remacemide 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg, or matching placebo daily for 5 weeks. Remacemide was found to be safe, with no serious adverse events occurring. It was also well tolerated, with the only dosage not well tolerated the 600 mg daily dose administered twice daily. Common side-effects were nausea and dizziness. However, there was no evidence of improvement in Parkinson's disease signs or symptoms associated with remacemide monotherapy. The study was begun in 1997 and the results published in 2000.
Remacemide Salts.
Remacemide is most commonly synthesized as the salt remacemide hydrochloride. However, there has been some investigation into other remacemide salts and their crystals, as different remacemide salts might taste more pleasant or have a solubility more suitable for a pediatric suspension formulation.
Drug development history.
Current status.
Remacemide is an experimental drug most recently being developed by the British multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. However, there has been little news of its progress since 2000. A few sources indicate that its development has been discontinued.
Changing hands.
Remacemide was one of the last drugs under development by the now-defunct English pharmaceutical company Fisons. In 1995, it was acquired along with most of Fisons' research and development operations by the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra, which in 1999 merged with the British company Zeneca to form AstraZeneca. In 2000, AstraZeneca considered possibly licensing out remacemide to some other pharmaceutical company, but there has been little news about remacemide since then. Remacemide's development may have been discontinued in July 2001.
Discovery and Development under Fisons.
In 1990, researchers at Fisons found that remacemide acted as an anticonvulsant in mice and rats 
. Because of remacemide's potential as a neuroprotective agent through preventing glutamate toxicity, it was soon also under investigation as a treatment for Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease.
Continuing Trials under Astra.
By 1995, when Astra acquired remacemide, it was already in Phase IIb clinical development as an anti-epileptic drug and Phase I clinical development as a treatment for Huntington's
Planned Trials and Submissions under AstraZeneca.
By 1998, when Astra announced its merger with Zeneca, remacemide had progressed to Phase III trials for epilepsy and Phase II trials for Parkinson's disease, and Astra was also investigating its potential for treating neuropathic pain
In 1999, after the merger, AstraZeneca reported that they were investigating remacemide for its neuroprotective effects, and that they planned regulatory submissions for Huntington's Disease in 2001 and for Parkinson's disease and epilepsy in 2003.
Remacemide, under the trade name Ecovia, was designated an orphan drug for the treatment of Huntington's Disease by the FDA in March 2000.
Remacemide was last mentioned in AstraZeneca's reports on its R&D pipeline in 2000, when it was in Phase III clinical trials for remacemide in the treatment of Huntington's disease and Phase II for treatment of Parkinson's disease. At that time, the submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA and the Marketing Authorization Application to the CHMP was projected for Huntington's in 2001 and for Parkinson's after 2003, but there has been no news of such submission. In this report, it was also noted that remacemide was "under strategic review and a potential candidate for licensing activity" (see this external article about drug licensing.)
Current news.
There are no clinical trials of remacemide in progress, according to the Huntington Study Group, and the Parkinson Study Group.
Availability.
Remacemide is an experimental drug not available to the public and not currently undergoing clinical trials. It is available for research purposes from Tocris Bioscience, under license from AstraZeneca.

Battery Weed

Battery Weed is a substantial three-tiered 19th century fortification guarding the Narrows, the main approach from the Atlantic Ocean to New York City. Located on the Staten Island waterfront on the west shore of the Narrows directly across from Fort Hamilton and the now-destroyed Fort Lafayette on Long Island, the fort was intended to protect New York from attack by sea.
Originally named Fort Richmond, the trapezoidal structure was designed by General Joseph G. Totten, the U.S. Army's Chief of Engineers, and was built between 1845 and 1861. It was renamed for fallen Civil War General Stephen Weed in 1863. Fort Tompkins was built on the bluff above Battery Weed to protect its landward face. Together, these fortifications later collectively became called Fort Wadsworth.
In 1903, a small lighthouse was built atop Battery Weed. Its light was visible for . When the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1965 the lighthouse became obsolete. Dark for many years, it was restored and converted to solar power by volunteers in 2005.
Fort Wadsworth was an active military base until 1994, operated by the U.S. Navy for its final few years. In 1995, Battery Weed, along with the rest of Fort Wadsworth, was transferred to the care of the National Park Service as part of Gateway National Recreation Area. Battery Weed's interior is open to the public on park ranger escorted tours only, although its exterior can be viewed at all times.

Charles Russell (Australian politician)

Charles Wilfred Russell (24 April 1907 – 21 October 1977) was an Australian politician, pastoralist and right wing activist who served briefly in both the Queensland and federal parliaments. Initially a member of the Country Party, he later became one of its key critics and campaigned actively against it in the 1950s and 1960s. His successful court action invalidating the Queensland government's stock levy in 1977, in the last year of his life, was one of his most significant achievements.
Early life.
Russell was born at Willambi, Manilla, near Tamworth in New South Wales. He was the fourth of five children, and the only surviving son, born to grazier Wilfred Adams Russell (who served in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland 1926–32) and his wife Millicent, daughter of pastoralist Charles Baldwin. The family moved to Queensland in 1910, settling at Dalmally station near Roma. In 1923, Wilfred acquired Jimbour, a property in the Darling Downs built by Sir Joshua Bell. Charles was educated at Cranbrook School in Sydney, and later worked as a jackeroo on his father's western Queensland sheep stations. In 1930 he became manager of Nardoo station in Cunnamulla.
Local politics and advocacy.
Wilfred Russell died in 1932, and Charles inherited the family properties. Elected to Wambo Shire Council in 1932, he was a prominent spokesman for the wool industry and advocated the construction of all-weather roads. He joined the board of Sturmfels Primary Producers' Co-operative Association in 1937 and was influential in arranging its merger with the Queensland Primary Producers' Co-operative Association.
In 1934, Russell travelled to the United States, where he learned to fly and acquired his first aeroplane, a Beechcraft Staggerwing. He enlisted as an airman pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force on 10 February 1941, and by May was a flight lieutenant, serving as an instructor at training schools around Australia until his transfer to the RAAF Reserve on 28 February 1944.
Family.
On 27 July 1944 at St John's Anglican Cathedral in Brisbane Charles Russell married Hilary Maude Newton, daughter of pastoralist Frank Newton. Together they had one daughter and four sons, one of whom is David Russell QC, barrister and politician
State and federal politics.
In 1936, Russell had helped to found the Queensland Country Party, and contested the Legislative Assembly of Queensland seats of Warrego in 1938 and Dalby in 1944. In 1947, the beneficiary of a campaign organised by James Killen, Russell was elected to the seat of Dalby, and focused on transport, land settlement, decentralisation and rural industries. He described the atmosphere of the Parliament as "friendly" but was frustrated in Opposition, leading to his decision to transfer to federal politics. He was endorsed as the Country Party's candidate for the seat of Maranoa at the 1949 federal election and was easily elected.
Disillusioned by the federal party's inability to act on its election promises, Russell resigned from the parliamentary party on 7 October 1950 when the government refused to raise the exchange rate and imposed a tax on wool. He sat on the cross benches for the rest of his term and contested the 1951 federal election as an independent. He polled 29.9% of the vote behind Labor's candidate, Alfred Dohring, and the official Country candidate, Wilfred Brimblecombe. His preferences ensured Brimblecombe's victory over Dohring.
Later life.
Russell was expelled by the Country Party after the election and applied to join the Liberal Party, but was rejected. He was a candidate for the Senate in the 1953 Senate only election as third on a ticket headed by Sir Raphael Cilento. He attempted to regain Maranoa at the 1954 election and came third with 17.4%. The absence of a Labor candidate for Maranoa at the 1955 election gave him 43.7% of the vote, finishing with 48.9% of the two-candidate preferred vote. He later contested the Queensland state seat of Condamine in 1972.
Russell's wealth and prominent connexions allowed him to continue to campaign for his beliefs. He continued to challenge both the Country Party and the Menzies Government, losing a High Court appeal against the validity of the federal wool tax in 1965 but successfully invalidating the Queensland government's stock levy in 1977.
Russell's views placed him on the right of the political spectrum. He was devoted to anti-socialism and the British Empire, and was associated with several other men who were disaffected with the major political parties, including Cilento, George Griffiths and economist Colin Clark. Russell and Cilento formed the short-lived Australian Democratic Party during the 1950s, and in the 1960s he was a leader in the Basic Industries Group and held membership of the Federal Inland Development Organisation. Although he had links with the Australian League of Rights, he did not join the League as he was opposed to its espousal of Social Credit theories. He joined the Workers Party (later the Progress Party) in the 1970s.
Russell and his wife Hilary co-wrote a book on their property in 1955, "Jimbour: Its History and Development"; Jimbour House was classified by the National Trust of Queensland and became a popular entertainment venue. Russell published his autobiography, "Country Crisis", in 1976.
Russell died at Dalby Hospital of a cerebral haemorrhage on 20 October 1977, a day after he collapsed while speaking at a meeting of the Maranoa branch of the Progress Party. He was survived by his wife, their daughter and their four sons. He was cremated.

Lymphatic disease

Lymphatic disease is a class of disorders which directly affect the components of the lymphatic system.
Examples include Castleman's disease and lymphedema.
Diseases and disorder
Hodgkin's Disease/Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a type of cancer of the lymphatic system. It can start almost any where in the body. It's believed to be caused by HIV, Epstein-Barr Syndrome, age and family history. Symptoms include weight loss, fever, swollen lymph nodes, night sweats, itchy skin, fatigue, chest pain, coughing and/or trouble swallowing.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Lymphoma is a usually malignant cancer. It's caused by the body producing too many abnormal white blood cells. It is not the same as Hodgkin's Disease. Symptoms usually include painless, enlarged lymph node or nodes in the neck, weakness, fever, weight loss, and anemia.
Lymphadenitis is an infection of the lymph nodes usually caused by a virus, bacteria or fungi. Symptoms include redness and/or swelling around the lymph node.
Lymphangitis
Lymphangitis is an inflammation of the lymph vessels. Symptoms usually include swelling, redness, warmth, pain and/or red streaking around the affected area.
Lymphedema
Lymphedema is the chronic pooling of lymph fluid in the tissue. It usually starts in the feet or lower legs. It's also a side-effect of some surgical procedures.
Lymphocytosis
Lymphocytosis is a high lymphocyte count. It can be caused by an infection, blood cancer, lymphoma, or autoimmune disorders that are accompanied by chronic swelling.

Mi-parti is an orchestral work by Polish composer Witold Lutosławski, composed 1975 - 1976 to a commission from the City of Amsterdam for the Concertgebouw Orchestra. The name broadly means "in two equal but different parts", referring to the treatment of the material rather than the large-scale structure of the piece.
First performance: October 22 X 1976, Rotterdam, Concertgebouw Orkest, the composer conducting.
Analysis.
The fifteen-minute piece starts off with ethereal, sliding string textures. A cantilena played by the bass clarinet slowly rises from the lowest registers. Other woodwind instruments soon join in, playing motives reminiscent of bird-song. An orchestral flourish, complete with brass, leads the music into the agitated second half (akin to a development section). The brass take on a more prominent role, and the previous ethereal textures are now replaced by rigorous rhythms in traditional notation. The music builds up to a powerful climax, incorporating Lutosławski's trademark semi-aleatoric techniques. The tension is subsequently released and the music reverts to ethereal beauty: divided strings slowly climb up to the highest registers, and the piece ends with soft repercussions from celesta, harp, and timpani.
Instrumentation.
The work calls for a large orchestra made up as follows:

Transfusion associated circulatory overload

In transfusion medicine, Transfusion associated circulatory overload (known as TACO) is a blood transfusion condition that occurs due to a rapid transfusion of a large volume of blood.
Symptoms.
The primary symptoms of TACO are dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema, and rapid increase of blood pressure.
Occurrence.
It is difficult to determine the incidence of TACO, but its incidence is estimated at about one in every 100 to 10,000 transfusions. The risk increases with patients over the age of 60 and patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, or anemia.
Prevention.
Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload is easily prevented by closely monitoring patients receiving transfusions and transfusing smaller volumes of blood at a slower rate.
Differentiation from TRALI.
While both are related to transfusion medicine and both are important, TACO differs from Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) in part by having longer hospital stays and increased morbidity.
The hypotension seen with TRALI and the hypertension seen with TACO provides a clinical differentiation of the two.

Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mandaphia

Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mandaphia, situated in Mandaphia town of Chittorgarh district of Rajasthan, is one of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas which are set up all over India. It is a part of the system of gifted education. The objectives of the scheme were to provide good quality modern education to the talented children predominantly of rural areas, without regard to their family's socioeconomic condition.

Reservation.
Seats are reserved for the children of rural areas. At least 75% of the seats of district are filled by candidates selected from rural areas and remaining seats are filled from the urban areas of the district. Reservation of seats in favour of children belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is also provided in proportion to their population in the concerned district. These reservations are interchangeable and over and above the candidates selected under open merit. Efforts are made to ensure that one-third of the total seats are filled up by girls.

William Shakespeare Burton

William Shakespeare Burton (1 June 1824 – 26 January 1916) was an English genre and historical painter of the Victorian era. He is now remembered mainly for "The Wounded Cavalier" (1855).
To paint his most famous work, Burton was said to have dug a hole in the ground to stand in, so that he could paint the grass and ferns at eye level. The work shows a scene from the English Civil War: a Cavalier courier has been ambushed and wounded, and is comforted by a Puritan maiden. Her jealous suitor, carrying a large Bible, looks on. 
The painting was shown at the Royal Academy show of 1856, through a strange set of circumstances. Burton's picture was reportedly left in a remote room with its face turned to the wall (by porters who, Burton believed, had not been sufficiently bribed). Academician A. S. Cope found the picture, brought it to the hanging committee's attention, and even withdrew one of his own works from the show to make room for Burton's, which was hung next to William Holman Hunt's "The Scapegoat".
"The Wounded Cavalier" was the artist's single flirtation with the Pre-Raphaelite movement of the 1850s; in later years Burton mainly devoted himself to painting religious subjects.
Burton's grandfather was a printer, and his father was William Evans Burton, a comic actor and playwright who found popular success in the United States — while leaving his wife and son behind in London, with little money. An only child, the younger Burton worked at copying prints as a teenager. The dramatist and critic Tom Taylor was his sponsor and patron. Taylor helped the teen find work at the magazine "Punch", a job designing capitals for illustrations (which provided much-needed income).
W. S. Burton was educated at King's College and the Royal Academy School. At the latter institution he won a gold medal in 1852 for a painting on the subject of Samson and Delilah. Though plagued by poor health and personal difficulties, Burton remained active as a painter into his eighties. His wife Mina Elizabeth Burton was the author of a novel titled "Ruling the Planets" (1891).

Geisha in Rivalry

, also translated under the title of "Rivalry", is a novel. "Rivalry: A Geisha’s Tale" was first published in Japanese in 1918 and was first translated into English in 1963. The author, Nagai Kafu, a Japanese novelist, was born in 1879 and died in 1959. Kafu was an editor of literary magazines before investigating Tokyo’s geisha world and writing novels. "Rivalry" is set in the early twentieth century (it begins around 1912) in Tokyo’s Shimbashi geisha district. "Rivalry" aims to capture the lives of Shimbashi geisha at a historically popular time for geisha.
Plot summary.
"Rivalry" begins with the return of the story’s protagonist, Komayo, to the geisha world. Having left the pleasure quarters to live in the countryside, she returns several years later because her husband has died, leaving her to fend for herself. She decides that she would rather relive her days as a geisha than to live as a peasant. Upon her return, she is reunited with a lover from her past, Yoshioka. The two had spent time together before Yoshioka left the country to study abroad. Yoshioka feels a rekindled desire for Komayo and calls for her often to spend much of her time with him attending events. Soon he suggests that he should become her danna. Although Komayo would be glad to have the financial support, she shies away from his proposal. Komayo and Yoshioka go on a weeklong vacation to hot spring resorts, but Yoshioka has to leave early, unexpectedly. Komayo stays and runs into Segawa, a man whom she desires instantly. After a brief, unforgettable affair, Komayo returns to Tokyo.
At the Kabuki theater Yoshioka overhears a conversation about the love affair between Komayo and Segawa. He seeks revenge by becoming involved with Kikuchiyo, a promiscuous geisha from Komayo’s okiya. As the novel progresses Komayo discovers that Yoshioka betrayed her. She’s hurt but pursues her relationship with Segawa with renewed determination. Segawa does not reciprocate the same devotion as Komayo. After a performance, Yoshioka’s first mistress, Rikiji, seeks her revenge on Komayo by introducing Segawa to a wealthy former geisha, Kimiryu. This new geisha’s financial situation pleases Segawa’s mother who never approved of Komayo.
The novel concludes with Komayo alone. The man who offered to support her and the man she loved have left her for other geisha. The mother of her okiya dies and her husband, Old Gozan, recognizes his inability to continue the house on his own; he passes it on to Komayo. She realizes that the geisha okiya means a lot to her. Gozan’s offer adds a glimmer of hope for Komayo with a life running the household herself.
Background information.
Female entertainers in Japan emerged during the 7th and 13th century. They performed for the nobility. During the Edo period prostitution was legal and was mostly within walled in districts such as Yoshiwara, which were licensed by the Tokugawa Shogunate, known as the pleasure quarters. In the 17th century, high-class courtesans known as "oiran", or men working as geisha, would perform at parties. During the 18th century, dancing women called "odoriko" became popular and began entertaining men at banquets in unlicensed districts. From this time on, the word geisha referred to women entertainers.
After the Meiji Restoration the government passed a law liberating prostitutes and geisha. This caused many controversies because the distinction between the two can be unclear. To clarify, the government intervened and stated that geisha were more refined than prostitutes; geisha were expected to be single and if they decided to marry then they had to drop their professions. They were not prostitutes, did not prepare food, and could not be considered wives. They performed at business banquets and were encouraged to have a "danna" for financial support but that commitment remained optional. Later, greater misunderstandings between geisha and prostitution emerged from the aftermath of WWII when the U.S. occupied Japan. Prostitutes hired to serve American GIs starting calling themselves geisha, which blurred the conceptual line.
Themes.
Nagai Kafu’s "Rivalry" tells the tale of a geisha walking the fine line between companionship and love. Throughout the novel, it becomes evident that a geisha should never fall in love, for she will surely be taken advantage of if she does. Kafu stresses that men are unreliable and that their intentions are never as they seem. It is hard for a geisha who is so dependent on men not to eventually fall in love, but it is this detachment in itself that will ultimately lead to her independence. She must use her power over men to get what she wants and keep her emotions in check. "Rivalry" shows a woman’s struggle to balance the geisha life with her desire for independence.
