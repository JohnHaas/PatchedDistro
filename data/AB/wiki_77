Al-Hasan ibn Adi

Shaykh al-Hasan ibn ‘Adī, known also by the Kurdish terms "Şêx Hesen" and "Şêx Sin", was a descendant of Umayyad Caliph Marwan ibn al-Hakam. He was the son and religious heir of ‘Adī ibn Sakhr and thus head of the ‘Adawiyya Ṣūfī Order. He was executed in a Mongol purge of the ‘Adawiyyūn in 1254. Şêx Hesen's subsequent role in Yezidi religion is formidable, rivaling only that of his ancestor, "Şêx Adi".
Şêx Hesen.
By the time of Şêx Hesen, a significant cult of sainthood had grown around the leaders of the ‘Adawiyya, and under his term of office, indigenous Kurdish beliefs and myths began to be incorporated into the beliefs of those following the Order.
More significantly, the growing military power of the Kurdish followers of Şêx Hesen lead to Mongol unease. The result of this was a crackdown on the community, and under the direction of the Atabeg of Mosul, Badr al-Din Lu'lu' (r. 1222–1259), the main worship center of the ‘Adawiyya was attacked and destroyed in 1254 and the bones of Şêx Adi disinterred and burned. Two hundred ‘Adawī followers were killed, and among them was Şêx Hesen.

Deeds of Flesh

Deeds of Flesh is a four-piece death metal band from Los Osos, California, USA. They were formed in 1993 by Jacoby Kingston, Erik Lindmark and Joey Heaslet and are still active. They founded their own label, Unique Leader Records, which has since become home to a number of other death metal bands from around the world. Deeds of Flesh have released eight studio albums, their most recent being "Portals to Canaan" which was released in 2013.
Overview.
Brief history.
Deeds of Flesh formed in 1993. They signed to Wild Rags Records and released their first EP, entitled "Gradually Melted". They then moved labels to the now-defunct Repulse Records, and released their first full-length album, entitled "Trading Pieces", in 1996.
Two years later, in 1998, they released a second album, entitled "Inbreeding the Anthropophagi", on the same label, this time with Brad Palmer replacing Joey Heaslet on drums. After this album was recorded, guitarist Jim Tkacz joined the band. The band then lost their contract with the label and self-released a demo. After this, they decided to form their own label Unique Leader Records. All their subsequent records were released on this label. The band then released a DVD called "Deeds of Flesh: Live In Montreal" in 2005.
In 2007, founding member and bassist Jacoby Kingston announced he was leaving the band, due to lifestyle changes. He was replaced by Erlend Caspersen.
In Summer 2012, Erik Lindmark was diagnosed with tendonitis, leading to a touring hiatus. The band's 8th full-length, "Portals to Canaan," is set for release on June 25, 2013.
Tours.
Deeds of Flesh has toured extensively over the past decade. After the release of "Mark of the Legion", the band supported Monstrosity on the "Bloodletting North America Pt. II" Tour. A year later, in 2002, they would tour with Disgorge and Dutch death metallers Severe Torture and Disavowed on the Bloodletting North America Part III tour. The band also performed a number of shows with Cannibal Corpse.
2004 found the band touring with such widely known American death metal acts as Dying Fetus and Hate Eternal. They also toured Australia with Tasmanian death metal group Psycroptic.
After sitting out much of 2005 due to injuries to Jacoby Kingston and Mike Hamilton, the band started touring again in 2006. They toured Europe alongside Monstrosity, Vile, and Impaled, then toured North America with Decrepit Birth, Vile, and Odious Mortem.
Musical style.
Their music can be described as influenced by the brutal technical death metal style pioneered by Suffocation coupled with a songwriting style that incorporates numerous time signature and/or tempo changes without warning, creating a disorienting atmosphere to the listener. The riffs themselves are atonal mixtures of fast tremolo picking, palm muted, and breakdowns. The drum parts also change frequently, mirroring the constantly shifting nature of the guitar lines. The vocals are a mixture of low growls and high screams. On former albums, the low vocals were performed by Lindmark and the high vocals by Kingston; however since Kingston's departure all vocals have been performed by Lindmark.
Prior to their 2008 release "Of What's to Come", Deeds of Flesh never implemented guitar solos. However on this album there are many, performed by newest guitarist Sean Southern.
Their lyrics deal mostly with common death metal subjects such as death, murder, disease, and horror. However "Of What's To Come" was lyrically a concept album in a post-apocalyptic science fiction style.

Adaptaur

History.
The breed was established on the Belmont Research Station near Rockhampton, Queensland and cattle were selected primarily for increased resistance and/or tolerance to tropical heat and cattle ticks ("Boophilus microplus"). 
Characteristics.
Adaptaur cattle are early maturing and of a medium size with a short dark red pigmented coat and good resistance to internal parasites. Some Adaptaurs carry a gene that produces extremely high resistance to cattle ticks and the Australian Hereford Society is assisting to increase frequency of the gene by embryo transfer.
It is capable of producing substantial hybrid vigor when used for crossbreeding. The F1 progeny grow faster and are more fertile than Brahmans. Adaptaurs have similar resistance to ticks and worms as Brahmans. They are at least 10% more efficient than Brahmans and have the favorable carcase qualities of the Bos taurus cattle.
Adaptaur cattle are mainly found in the tropical areas of northern Australia.

Rubicon (The Duggans album)

Rubicon is the début studio album by The Duggan brothers (of Clannad). It was released in 2005.
From the press release:
On this, their first solo album, they have gathered together friends made over the years for a remarkable collaboration of talents. They have, perhaps, travelled full circle.
In an official interview on Clannad's official website, Padraig Duggan explains the song Lisa/Liza which appeared on Clannad's debut album as well as on "Rubicon". The song is used internationally in schools and on Summer Gaeltacht courses in Belfast, Donegal and further afield:
In the early 1970’s, Clannad won the Letterkenny Folk festival with that song. I actually wrote it up on the roof of Leo’s Tavern! I was up there for some reason with my guitar. It is an upbeat popsong, I suppose I was influenced by bands such as The Beatles. It was a unique song at the time a popsong in Gaeilge! It proved popular in the local schools the young people seemed to adopt it.

He was the son and religious heir of al-Hasan ibn ‘Adī after the death of al-Hasan's son.

Life.
Şêx Fexreddin's life was unusual for several reasons. Unlike his predecessors, he was on good standing with the Mongols, who had been responsible for the death of his two immediate predecessors. He also succeeded his nephew rather than his father. Additionally, he was the first ‘Adawī leader to face internecine rivalry: in 1275, Şêx Fexreddin's brother Shemseddin revolted and attempted to seize power from him. Şêx Fexreddin and his allies defeated Shemseddin, who fled to Syria. Finally, he is the last known ‘Adawī shaykh.

Femke Dekker (born 11 July 1979) is a Dutch rower from the Netherlands.
Dekker started rowing in 1990 and made her international debut in the double sculls at the 1995 Junior World Championships in Poznan. Together with Christel Rijnten she won the bronze medal. The following year Dekker became World Junior Champion in the fours with Rijnten, Karin Klinge and Maartje Breeman in Glasgow. In 1997 she finished fifth in the single scull race at the Junior World Championships in Hazewinkel. She kept on rowing the single scull in 1998 with winning a bronze medal in the Nations Cup. In 1999 in the double sculls with Annemieke Klaren she was unsuccessful.
Dekker and Marloes Bolman qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and became 10th in the coxless pairs. In 2001 she formed a fours boat with Anneke Venema, Hurnet Dekkers and Carin ter Beek that finished fourth and fifth at the Rowing World Cup meetings in Sevilla and Munich. At the World Championships in Luzern with Christine Vink as a replacement of Hurnet Dekkers they won the bronze medal in the coxless fours. 2002 was a disappointing year for Dekker as she only reached two fourth places in World Cup meetings with Marlies Smulders, Nienke Hommes and Melina Bus in the fours. At the World Championships they could only reach to an eighth position. The double sculls season in 2003 with Froukje Wegman was even more disappointing as not one single A-final was reached. She decided to row on her own in 2004 and to aim to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics. In the single scull she became fifth and third in World Cup meetings, which secured her spot in Athens, but at the Olympics itself she only was able to finish in tenth position. 
In 2005 it was time to start with the newly born Dutch eights project. The team existing of Dekker, Sanne Beukers, Nienke Hommes, Hurnet Dekkers, Annemarieke van Rumpt, Laura Posthuma, Annemiek de Haan, Helen Tanger and cox Ester Workel managed to row to the second spot at the World Cup meeting in Munich straight away. With Marlies Smulders instead of Hommes they reached the same spot in Luzern. Hommes returned to the team instead of Smulders for the World Championships, while Beukers was replaced by Nienke Dekkers. This team dropped down one place and won the bronze medal. In 2006 Dekker remained in the eights, but at the World Championships in Eton she performed in the coxless fours with Posthuma, Nienke Kingma and Roline Repelaer van Driel to finish in fifth.
She returned to the eights in 2007 rowing to two third positions in the World Cup in Linz and Luzern as well as the first place in Amsterdam with Jacobine Veenhoven, Smulders, Hurnet Dekkers, Van Rumpt, Repelaer van Driel, Sarah Siegelaar, De Haan and Workel. Then at the World Championships in Munich the team failed to achieve the A-final and had to be satisfied with the 7th position overall. In 2008 the team tried to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics and at the first World Cup in Munich Veenhoven was replaced by Nienke Dekkers while Hurnet Dekkers was replaced by Nienke Kingma; they finished in fourth position. Helen Tanger replaced Nienke Dekkers in the second meeting held in Luzern and another fourth position was achieved. This also meant the Olympic qualification was accomplished.

Palashpur

Haider Ali Talukder, founder of Palashpur village
Palashpur is a village in Matiranga () Upazila of Khagrachari () District, Bangladesh. Palashpur village was named and made habitable by Mr. Haider Ali Talukder and few of his comrades. The village covers an area of 7.43 km2 (approx) and is surrounded by Hatiapara village to the East, Kheda Chhara to the North, Ojodda to the West and Matiranga Sadar to the South. Palashpur under Matiranga Pourashava was established in 1981. The village consists of three wards and few Mahallas. The village has a primary school (Palashpur Primary School), four mosques, a madrasa, three community schools and about five small hills. Non-governmental organizations operating in Palashpur include UNDP, BDAO (Bangladesh Development Acceleration Organisation), Grameen Bank, BRAC, ASA.
History.
Palashpur was one of the most fearful and deep jungle areas in the district. Nobody had the courage to enter the area due to the prevalence of tribal terrorism activities (in Bengali these terrorists are called Shantibahinee). Nobody couldn’t think of going there let alone living there. Mr. Haider Ali Talukder was first man who visited this area and created a modern village and named it Palashpur.
Mr. Haider Ali Talukdar was born December 28, 1957 in Gopalgonj District, Bangladesh. He was a famous business man in Dhaka during late seventies. When he went Khagrachhary he was the Chairman of “tribal and non-tribal rehabilitation project”. Then he worked there for homeless people of Bangladesh.

James Templer

Colonel James Lethbridge Brooke Templer (27 May 1846 – 2 January 1924) was an early British military pioneer of balloons. He was an officer in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and Royal Engineers. Templer set out a scientific foundation for British military ballooning. In particular he worked out routines for balloon handling, how to use hydrogen in cylinders and methods for training observers.
Biography.
James Templer was the son of John Templer. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. Whilst serving in the King's Royal Rifle Corps Templer became interested in military ballooning.
In 1878 Captain Templer and Captain C M Watson started the first regular British Army balloon school at Woolwich. The school was started with Templer's own balloon, the "Crusader". At the same time, Templer was appointed Instructor in Ballooning to the Royal Engineers. The following year Captain Templer took command of the newly established military balloon department at Chatham.
On 10 December 1881 Captain Templer was accompanied by Walter Powell the MP for Malmesbury and Mr. A. Agg-Gardner, brother of James Agg-Gardner - then between terms as MP for Cheltenham - in the balloon "Saladin". The group departed Bath and headed towards Dorset. In time they found themselves within half a mile of the sea near Eypesmouth which is to the west of Bridport. As the balloon was rapidly drifting seaward, they attempted to descend. The balloon touched the ground a mere 150 yards from the cliff edge. The balloon dragged along and ground and Templer exited the basket holding the valve line in his hand. As the balloon had just been lightened, it rose about eight feet and Agg-Gardner jumped out breaking his leg. Powell was now the only occupant of the balloon. Templer, who had still hold of the line, shouted to Powell to climb down the line. Powell made a move for the rope but the balloon rose, tearing the line out of Templer's hands. The balloon climbed rapidly and Powell was taken out to sea. He was never seen again.
By 1885, Templer had achieved the rank of major. During the British Army's expedition to the Sudan in 1885, Templer took three balloons. He was mentioned in despatches for his actions during the Hasheen engagement.
In 1888 Templer was accused, arrested and charged with providing the Italian Government with British secrets about military ballooning. The case was found to be without foundation and Templer was honourably acquitted.
Templer married Florence Henrietta Gilliat at Chorley Wood in Watford on 12 January 1889. Their daughter Ursula Florence Templer was born in London the following year on 29 August 1890.
During the Second Boer War, Templer served in the Scientific and Departmental Corps as a lieutenant colonel. He was able to put his interest in steam traction to use. He served as Director of Steam Road Transport during the war.
By 1902, Templer had reached the rank of colonel and he decided that it was time to construct a British military airship. Under Templer's direction, in 1905 the Balloon Factory relocated to Farnborough. where work could be started on an airship shed. This, and a shortage of money, delayed the project. Work on the British Army Dirigible No 1, named "Nulli Secundus" ("Second to none") was not complete until 1907 by which time Templer was no longer the superintendent of the Balloon Factory, Colonel Capper having taken over in 1906.
Templer continued as the superintendent of the Balloon Factory until retiring from service in 1908.
He died at Laughton Grange in the Sussex town of Lewes on 2 January 1924.

Fred Miller (producer)

Fred W. Miller is a media producer, teacher and consultant. Fred is married to Kathryn Buffington Miller (1967) and has one son, Browning Blake Miller (b. 1972). Miller and his wife reside in Austin, Texas.
Born in East Texas to Rupert and Era Miller (January 23, 1943), Fred was raised in Texas. His father was a minister who served several congregations in the state.
Education and early career.
Miller attended Baylor University and studied Communications, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1966. Following his graduation from Baylor and marriage to Kathryn Buffington, Miller entered the Metropolitan Urban Study Program in New York City directed by Bill Webber of East Harlem Protestant Parish. While participating in the study program, Miller also worked for WCBS NewsRadio 880. In 1968, the Millers moved to Austin, Texas where Miller served as an associate minister of First Baptist Church. It was there in March, 1969 that Miller met Peter, Paul and Mary and convinced them to allow him to make a documentary of their music and activism. That documentary, called The Song is Love, was among the first films made on Peter, Paul and Mary. The film, shot and directed by Tobe Hooper, aired on PBS for ten years starting in Easter 1970. The Song is Love was a major fund-raising event for PBS during the seventies.
Miller then began developing curriculum for the Texas Education Agency, using role-playing games and short “trigger” films to teach Career Education. During the seventies, Miller assisted Warren Skaaren in starting the Texas Film Commission. Miller also began developing feature films with John Heyman of World Film Services, Inc.
Career to Date.
Filmmaker Al Reinert approached Miller in 1986 to assist in completing one of Reinert’s projects, "For All Mankind". The film documents the Apollo missions from 1968 to 1972. In 1989, "For All Mankind" was selected as the Audience Favorite and the Grand Jury Winner at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award. The film participated in many major film festivals in 1989 and 1990.
In the early 1990s, Miller and a team of educators and sociologists designed a program for IBM called “The Advancement of Women.” Miller chose Rosabeth Kanter’s classic male and female stereotypes as the basis for humorous “trigger” videos. In addition to producing and directing the five videos, called “Perceptions”, Miller traveled to many of the IBM plants facilitating two-day workshops for IBM executives.
Texas Entertainment News! was founded by Miller in 1995 to combine broadcast television and Internet streaming. Though the show was top-rated, the lack of broadband users in 1995 prevented its growth and it was canceled after one season.
That same year Miller received the W. R. White Meritorious Service Award from Baylor University.
In 1999 Miller joined Lloyd Walker at Human Code, Inc., a digital-content studio that built web sites, developed computer games and created broadband programming. Human Code was eventually sold to Sapient.
In 2000, Miller produced and directed A Most Significant Journey, one of the first high definition traveling showcases presented in major cities across America. The 35-minute HD show gave a first hand look of what it was like to be a student at Baylor University in 2000.
Current activities.
The Comical Sense Company (now The Trevor Romain Company) was founded by Miller, Trevor Romain and Woody Englander in 2003 with the goal of promoting social and emotional fitness for elementary school children through animated programming. The Trevor Romain Show is seen on PBS. Some of the awards it has received are: Cine Golden Eagle, a top Telly, and the Oppenheim Gold DVD Award. Miller retired from the company in 2007.
Miller, along with producers Elizabeth Avellán and Shannon McIntosh, recently produced Turk Pipkin’s Christmas novel When Angels Sing as a feature film under the title ANGELS SING. The movie stars Harry Connick, Jr., Connie Britton, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Lyle Lovett. Tim McCanlies is the director. The movie was released in theaters by Lionsgate in November 2013. 
Miller has several feature film projects in development. He continues to guest lecture at Baylor University and Texas State University.

Chatanika River

The Chatanika River is a tributary of the Tolovana River in the U.S. state of Alaska. The Chatanika River is a clear or lightly tannic stained rapid-runoff stream that has its headwaters in the mountains of the northeastern portion of the Alaska Range and flows westward through valleys between summits and uplands for about four-fifths of its length before it enters Minto Flats. Once in the flats—a marshy area in which multiple streams, rivers, and lakes are located— the Chatanika joins the Tolovana, which flows into the Tanana River and on to the Yukon River. The Chatanika is thus a portion of the Yukon River drainage basin.
During the first portion of the 20th century, the Chatanika was dominated by the gold-mining industry, which used its flow to operate gold dredges. The most visible example of this was the construction of the Davidson Ditch, a dam-and-pipeline system used to divert water to gold-mining operations closer to Fairbanks. The Ditch was abandoned in the 1950s, and during the 1967 Tanana Valley flood, the dam was damaged and became inoperable. In January 2002, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service removed the dam in conjunction with other groups, restoring the Chatanika's original flow. Today, the upper Chatanika is a moderately popular rafting and fishing destination, and vacation cabins have been built at spots along its banks.
Chatanika, Alaska, located near the river, shares its name with the river.
The river contains arctic grayling, arctic lamprey, burbot, chum salmon, humpback whitefish, king salmon, least cisco, longnose suckers, northern pike, sheefish, and slimy sculpins. 
Boating.
Boaters can float the Chatanika River in many kinds of non-motorized watercraft. The Elliott Highway, which crosses the river below the village of Chatanika, and the Steese Highway, which parallels the river further upstream, offer multiple places to begin and end boating trips. Several public campgrounds and waysides along these highways afford access to the river. The entire river is rated Class I (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Dangers include logjams and overhanging trees and stumps.

Buck and the Preacher opens with deep rhythm and blues soundtrack reminiscent of a modern John Wayne Western that was given deep soul and harmony from the 1970s. The camera then switches scenes into a camp of African Americans who were just freed from slavery and are traveling West for a better life. Suddenly, a band of men on horseback terrorize the camp by burning wagons and tents and killing men, women and children. The leader of these white bandits, DeShay (Cameron Mitchell), is wearing an old cavalry jacket hinting at his military past.
Buck (Sydney Poitier) enter the scene and dismounts his horse about to walk up to his home. DeShay makes Buck's wife, Ruth (Ruby Dee), wave to him as if everything is all right. Buck begins to approach the house and is then engulfed in a firefight between DeShay's posse. He gets on his horse and flees the scene after being chased by the posse and stops at an apparently empty campsite that has a campfire, food and a horse. A naked man, the Preacher (Harry Belafonte), is washing at the stream below and approaches the campsite to dress, but Buck stops him and steals his horse and breakfast at gunpoint. 
The Preacher dresses and takes Buck's horse to the nearest town where he grabs a drink and finds out the location of the nearby camp from an African American boy working at the general store. 
The Preacher is approached by DeShay and is told that any information leading to finding Buck or bringing Buck in dead or alive will be a five hundred dollar reward. The Preacher is excited about this because he has a good feeling Buck is out by the African American wagon camp the little boy spoke of earlier. 
Buck returns to the camp to be told by the men that the elder wise man thinks they should continue West and not turn back. The elder is shown using animal teeth and throwing them on a towel, which the audience assumes to be a prediction of the future. Buck agrees to further helping the group when the Preacher appears and punches Buck in the face. Buck agrees to feeding the Preacher and giving his horse back, after which the Preacher must depart and leave their camp. Buck does this because he is fearful of the Preacher's motives for wanting to stay after he is caught looking at the women folk and wondering where the money was kept. 
The Preacher leaves the group and stalks Buck when he leaves to make a deal with the Native Americans. The Native Americans pursue the Preacher and Buck bargains with them for protection of the wagon group. The Native Americans are portrayed as shrewd bargainers who constantly haggle for a better deal with Buck. After reaching an agreement, the Preacher has a newfound respect for Buck because of his hard work effort and desire to help the traveling freed slaves. 
While the two protagonists were negotiating, DeShay and his men strike the camp again and do similar damage. The Preacher turns cheek at this point in the film and stops attempting to corner and kill Buck for the reward because of Buck's compassion towards the wagon camp. The Preacher tells Buck where DeShay and his men are quartered at and suggests an ambush. 
Buck agrees to the Preacher's plan and they ambush DeShay and kill him and most of his men. The sheriff in the town pursues the two, but they make a dramatic escape on horseback. The two then decide with Buck's wife to rob the bank at the town where they murdered DeShay's men with hopes of gaining more money for the African Americans in the camp so they have a better chance of surviving the winter West. The three rob the mail office first unsuccessfully and then cross the street and rob the actual bank. The entire scene is a comedy because of the daunting risks being taken while still doing so in a relaxed manner. The sheriff returns during the robbery and chases the three money filled robbers out of town. 
Buck, the Preacher and Ruth ride hard for the Indian Territory and reach it just in time. The Native Americans are formed in columns on horseback defending their boundary and do not permit entry to the sheriff and the posse. The sheriff continues the search and finds the wagon camp and decides not to attack it. One of the men in the posse suggests they attack the camp to bring out Buck, but the sheriff disagrees arguing that the African Americans did no harm. 
The man kills the sheriff and orders the posse to attack. Buck approaches the wagon camp and lures the posse away to the mountains. A gunfight ensues and the Preacher is wounded, but the posse is defeated. The Native Americans who said they would not help fight Buck's battle did send several men to help and ended up being the force that turned the tide of the shootout in Buck's favor. 
The movie ends with Buck, the Preacher and his wife riding happily into the prairie.
Setting.
The film is set in the Kansas Territory immediately following the Civil War. Late 1860s.
Production.
Buck and the Preacher was one the first films directed by an African American and to be based on a band of African Americans fighting against the White Majority. Sidney Poitier directed the film and it was produced by Belafonte Enterprises, Columbia Pictures Corporation and E & R Productions Corp. The film was recorded in Durango, Mexico, as well as in Kenya. It was released in the United States in 1972.
Reception.
Buck and the Preacher was received warmly at first because of the first time a leading black character was able to exact violent revenge on a white hegemony. Black Westerns, and Westerns in general, declined after that because 1970s audiences became indifferent to the excitement of the Wild West.

North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911

The North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, formally known as the Convention between the United States and Other Powers Providing for the Preservation and Protection of Fur Seals, was an international treaty signed on July 7, 1911 designed to manage the commercial harvest of fur bearing mammals (such as Northern fur seals and sea otters) in the Pribilof Islands of the Bering Sea. The treaty, signed by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia, outlawed open-water seal hunting and acknowledged the United States' jurisdiction in managing the on-shore hunting of seals for commercial purposes. It was the first international treaty to address wildlife preservation issues.
Terms of the treaty.
The two most significant terms of the treaty were the banning of pelagic seal hunting and the granting of jurisdiction to the United States in managing on-shore hunts. In exchange for granting jurisdiction to the United States, the other signatories to the treaties were guaranteed payments and/or minimum takes of seal furs while the treaty remained in effect, subject to certain conditions.
The treaty also provided an exemption to aboriginal tribes which hunted seals using traditional methods and for non-commercial purposes including food and shelter. Aboriginal tribes specifically mentioned in the treaty include the Aleut and Aino (Ainu) peoples.
Authorship and ratification.
The treaty was co-authored by environmentalist Henry Wood Elliott and United States Secretary of State John Hay in 1905, although the treaty was not ratified for another six years. The treaty was signed at Washington, D.C. on July 7, 1911, with ratifications by each signatory on the following dates:
Ratifications were then exchanged at Washington on December 12, 1911, and the treaty was proclaimed two days later on December 14. 
Enactment and legacy.
Following ratification, the United States Congress enacted an immediate 5-year moratorium on hunting, to allow for recovery of the decimated herds. The treaty remained in effect until hostilities erupted among the signatories in World War II. However, the treaty set precedent for future national and international laws and treaties, including the Fur Seal Act of 1966 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.

Bell Rock Memorial Park

Bell Rock Memorial Park is a public park between Main, Wigglesworth, Meridan, and Ellis Streets in Malden, Massachusetts. The west side of the rock is the site of the two earliest Congregational meeting houses in Malden (First Meeting House 1649-1658 and Second Meeting House 1660-1730). The park also has an American Civil War memorial statue "The Flag Defenders" by Bela Pratt and a World War II memorial. The park was laid out in 1910 by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
History.
The rocky outcrop that is the most prominent feature of Bell Rock Memorial Park has been an important local landmark since early colonial days. A bell was hung from scaffolding on top of the rock in 1658 to summon the faithful for worship; it is from this usage that the park derives its name. Although it was the site of Malden's first two meeting houses, the second was removed in 1727 (as was the bell), and the immediate area remained as pastureland until 1904.
In 1907 the city awarded a commission to Bela Pratt to create a sculpture commemmorating the city's American Civil War soldiers. To find a site for this monument, the city engaged Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., who had been consulting for the city on the development of other parks in its system. Olmsted recommended the Bell Rock site, which was acquired by the city in 1904. Olmsted worked on the park's design from 1908 to 1917. He carefully laid out its paths to take account of the site's topography, and to provide ready views of Pratt's sculpture, which he sited at the highest point of the park. The paths were also laid out to provide a seamless connection to the neighborhood, despite the topographical challenges posed by its sometimes significant changes in elevation.
The bronze sculpture "The Flag Defenders" is composed of three figures, representing the three branches of the military at the time: Navy, Army, and Marines. One figure holds an American flag; the other two crouch and watch guard. It is mounted on a base designed by R. Clipson Sturges. In addition to this sculpture, the city has added a number of other memorials to the park. There are several plaques, commemmorating the site's early history and the city's Revolutionary War soldiers, as well as larger memorials to the various conflicts the country has been involved in since the park's creation. There is also a stone and bronze tablet commemmorating Michael Wigglesworth, one of Malden's leading 17th century ministers.

The John Bickford House is a historic late First Period house at 235 Elm Street in North Reading, Massachusetts. The c. 1735 two story timber frame house has relatively conservative First Period features despite its somewhat (comparatively) late construction date, which may be due to John Bickford's strong connections with nearby Salem.

Billerica Mills Historic District is a historic district between the Concord River, Treble Cove Terrace, Kohlrausch Avenue, Indian Road, Holt Ruggles, and Rogers Streets in the village of North Billerica, Massachusetts (part of the town of Billerica).
The C.P. Talbot & Company mill building still stands in the center of the district. The buildings were planned and sited over decades, spanning from the mid-19th century until the 1920s. The Talbot brothers were able to secure land bordering the Concord Falls from the defunct Middlesex Canal Company (MCC) in 1851. The dam, water power and of MCC land were secured for $10,000.
In 1857, CP Talbot secured additional property from neighbor Faulkner and an agreement with Faulkner over water power rights. Also in 1857 they partnered with the Lowell-based Belvidere Company for 5 years, supplying water power while Belvidere gave the equipment and know-how. The exact date of the large brick building and clock tower is not known, but likely between 1865 and 1870. It was at this time that the Talbot brothers built the first tenement company housing for workers as well.
The company operated and existed for 100 years until 1956. The Talbot brothers were the children of Charles (Ireland) and Phoebe Talbot (married in 1802) whose children were Charles P. (b. 1807) and Thomas (b. 1818) among six others. From Cambridge, New York, they moved to Vermont and then Northampton, Massachusetts, where the brothers learned the trades of the textile mills.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Mother Goose Goes Hollywood

Mother Goose Goes Hollywood is a 1938 Walt Disney animated short featuring parodies of Mother Goose nursery rhymes and caricatures of Hollywood celebrities from the 1930s. It is the 73rd of the series and also the last to carry the Silly Symphony name in the title cards. The cartoon is directed by Wilfred Jackson, and animated by Bill Tytla and Ward Kimball. It can be found in disc 2 of "More Silly Symphonies" in the Walt Disney Treasures, released in 2006.
Plot.
The film begins with a nursery book that opens by itself. In a spoof of Leo the Lion (MGM) logo Bugs Bunny roars like a Dinosaur Underneath the goose is written, in Pig Latin, "Nertz to You". The opening disclaimer states that "any resemblance to characters herein portrayed to persons living or dead, is purely coincidental." Little Bo Peep (Katharine Hepburn) claims she "lost her sheep, really I have". After performing a few ballet steps she looks behind the next page of the book, which is turned around.
The next scene shows Old King Cole (Hugh Herbert) excited when his fiddlers arrive: (The Marx Brothers). The trio starts playing their violins, but then break them over their knees. The king enjoys this very much, but his court jester (Ned Sparks) obviously not. The king commends their entertainment, calling it "Over the hedge". Then Joe Penner brings the king a bowl and, in reference to his famous catch phrase, asks him if he "wants to buy a duck?" Donald Duck appears out of the water in the bowl and starts laughing with Penner's joke. The king then closes the bowl, much to the chagrin of Donald.
On the following page the nursery rhyme Rub-a-dub-dub is portrayed with Charles Laughton (as Captain Bligh), Spencer Tracy (as Manuel Fidello from "Captains Courageous") and Freddie Bartholomew (who also appeared in "Captains Courageous"). Bartholomew falls overboard, but Tracy pulls him back aboard. Then Katharine Hepburn passes by on an outboard motor still looking for her sheep. The tub overturns when the trio tries to hitch a ride with Hepburn. 
W. C. Fields plays Humpty Dumpty. He inspects a bird's nest with the words, "My Little Chickadee", but discovers Charlie McCarthy sitting in it. He insults Fields who tries to attack him, but then falls off the wall unto a mushroom which then resembles an egg cup.
Simple Simon (Stan Laurel) is seen fishing with a fish on his hook and catching worms instead of the other way around. The Pieman (Oliver Hardy) is busy tending a pile of his pies on a wagon. Laurel refuses an offered pie, and picks one from the middle of the pile, which scares Hardy, fearing the pile will collapse. Nothing happens, however and a reassured Hardy tries to do the same. When the pile collapses and one of the pies lands on his head, he looks angrily at Laurel. Laurel swallows his pie in one piece and then snickers at Hardy. Hardy throws one of his pies at Laurel, who ducks, and the pie lands in the face of Katharine Hepburn. The pie transforms her face into a blackface and she starts speaking in African-American slang. 
See Saw Margery Daw is performed by Edward G. Robinson and Greta Garbo on a seesaw. Garbo says: "I want so much to be alone", to which Robinson replies: "O.K., babe, you asked for it!". He leaves and Garbo falls off the see saw.
Little Jack Horner (Eddie Cantor) opens the next scene, a big musical sequence. He sings Sing a Song of Sixpence and when he mentions the line, "twenty black birds baking a pie" several Afro-American jazz and swing musicians stick their head out of a large pie. One of them is Cab Calloway (singing "Hi-de-Ho!") who invites Little Boy Blue (Wallace Beery) to blow his horn. When this takes some time, Fats Waller asks: "Where's that boy?", to which Stepin Fetchit replies: "What boy?". Beery finally wakes up and blows his horn until he's out of breath. 
The book pops open to reveal a big shoe (a reference to There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe) and all the characters start singing, dancing and playing instruments. The camera zooms in on three trumpet playing ladies (Edna May Oliver, Joan Blondell (some sources claim the middle woman is Mae West or Sophie Tucker) and ZaSu Pitts), a flute player (Clark Gable) and a saxophonist (George Arliss). Oliver Hardy plays trombone and Stan Laurel clarinet, whose repeated notes annoy Hardy so much he hits Laurel over the head with a hammer. Laurel's clarinet then sounds like a bass clarinet.
Fats Waller plays piano until Groucho and Chico start playing with him. He sends them away, but discovers that his piano now plays by himself. When he looks inside, Harpo is seen plucking the strings. He exclaims: "The man's crazy!". Fred Astaire tap dances and invites Stepin Fetchit to dance along with him. Fetchit tries to encourage his feet by singing "Get Along, Little Doggies", but he is too lazy, and his feet release steam from the effort. Cab Calloway is much more excited and energetic and sings and dances along with his band. W.C. Fields plays double bass with Charlie McCarthy sitting on the instrument. Charles Laughton declares the music to be "It's mutiny, but I love it!". Martha Raye and Joe E. Brown are seen dancing and laughing so loud that their mouths are opened wide. When Raye kisses Joe E. Brown (leaving a large lipstick smear) his mouth opens so wide that the camera tracks inside. There, Katharine Hepburn is still looking for her sheep.
Censorship.
Since the 1960s this cartoon has not been broadcast very often on television, due to the stereotypical depictions of African Americans in some scenes. Sometimes it has been broadcast minus the scenes with African Americans. Only a few scenes however can be considered racially offensive. First of all, Hepburn being hit in the face with a pie, which makes her resemble a black face singer speaking in stereotypical African American slang. Secondly the comparison between blackbirds and African-Americans by Cantor, and thirdly the caricature of Stepin Fetchit, whose lazy, dimwitted behavior may offend contemporary viewers who might not know the actor and his typical movie roles. 
As animation critic Charles Solomon noted in his book: "Enchanted Drawings: History of Animation", the caricatures of Fats Waller and Cab Calloway don't poke fun at their race and are treated just as good or bad like the other caricatured celebrities spoofed in this cartoon.

St. George Coptic Orthodox Church (Philadelphia)

St George Coptic Orthodox Church (Coptic: // transliteration: "ti.eklyseya en.remenkimi en.orthodoxos ente fi.ethowab Gewargios") is one of the oldest Coptic Orthodox churches established in North America. It is one of over 200 Coptic Orthodox Churches in the US.
History.
St. George Coptic Orthodox Church is the first Coptic Orthodox church that was established in Pennsylvania during 1969 and was incorporated in May 1973 with 30 families at the time. Several Coptic Orthodox priests served the congregation in churches of other denominations until 1980, when the Conshohocken building was purchased. HH Pope Shenouda III assigned Father Samuel Thabet Samuel to head that church in September 1983, and Father Samuel and his wife and two children left Egypt and moved to Roxborough.
After a certain period of time, the congregation bought the current building in Norristown, Pennsylvania. The parish, built in 1863, uses Greek revival architecture and was originally a Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church. In order for the building to allow for Coptic Orthodox Liturgies, the interior required a partial conversion for that use. The exterior, however, retained its architectural style. The building was consecrated in October 1994, by HH Pope Shenouda III.
The parish did in fact have more than one priest in its history. Fr. Angelos Habib Boghdadi served the parish in its early years, as well as several other Coptic Churches throughout the States, including St. Mary Coptic Orthodox Church in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. Fr. Boghdadi is currently the priest of St. George Church in Tampa, Florida.
Formative years.
During the church's formative years in the 1980s, Fr. Samuel Thabet Samuel was the parish priest. He served until 1990 when summoned by His Holiness Pope Shenouda III to serve St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church of Chicago, Illinois [http://www.stmarkcchicago.org where he currently serves as the senior priest. In 1991 Pope Shenouda sent the current priest to the parish, Fr. Roufail Z. Youssef. There are currently over 300 Coptic families served by St. George's Church.

David Mitchell (murderer)

David Mitchell (1972 – 6 January 2000) was a murderer who killed two German tourists in the Bahamas and was executed as a result. His is the most recent execution to be performed by the Bahamas.
Mitchell was convicted of stabbing two tourists from Germany to death and received the mandatory sentence of death by hanging. He was originally scheduled to be executed on 10 August 1999, but his execution was delayed to allow the Bahamian appeal courts to hear his appeal on the constitutionality of the death penalty. His appeal was rejected by the Bahamian courts and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which acts as the final court of appeal for the Bahamas. Mitchell was executed in the Fox Hill Prison in Nassau on the morning of 6 January 2000.
Mitchell's execution was controversial because it was carried out while he had an appeal pending before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Amnesty International alleged that this amounted to a violation of the Bahamas' treaty obligations as a member of the Organization of American States. The victims' son had also requested that the death sentence be commuted. John Higgs was scheduled to be executed the same day as MItchell for an unrelated murder, but he committed suicide the day before.

Fells Connector Parkways

The Fells Connector Parkways are a group of historic parkways in the cities of Malden and Medford, Massachusetts, suburbs north of the city of Boston. The three parkways, The Fellsway, Fellsway West, and Fellsway East serve to provide access from the lower portion of the Mystic River Reservation to the Middlesex Fells Reservation. The latter two parkways continue northward, providing access to the interior of the Fells and providing a further connection to the Lynn Fells Parkway. Significant portions of these parkways south of the Fells, which were among the first connecting parkways designed to be part of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston by Charles Eliot, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.
Background.
Following the enactment of authorizing legislation in 1894, the Metropolitan Parks Commission (predecessor to the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) and today's Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)) began working with Charles Eliot to plan a parkway to provide access from Boston to the Middlesex Fells Reservation. This job was made difficult due the existence of relatively densely populated areas between the Mystic River and the reservation. The plan that the commission and Eliot finally drafted called for an arterial trunk (The Fellsway), which would run north through Medford and Malden, and then split into two branches. Fellsway West would provide access to the promontory point at Pine Hill in Medford (now visible on the west side of Interstate 93) and the western parts of the reservation, while Fellsway East would provide access to Bear's Den Hill in Malden, and points east. These corridors were wide () rights of way, in order to provide for several modes of transportation: automobile, street car, and pedestrians and cyclists.
The Fellsway.
Land for The Fellsway was acquired in 1896. Its original southern terminus was at Mystic Avenue in Somerville, and was further extended south to Broadway in 1898. The Somerville section of the parkway south of Mystic Avenue later became part of the McGrath Highway, and the intervening section was extensively altered by the construction of I-93. The Fellsway is designated Massachusetts Route 28 for its entire length. From Somerville it crosses the Mystic River into Medford on the Wellington Bridge and soon enters the Wellington Circle interchange, where it joins with the Mystic Valley Parkway and the Revere Beach Parkway, both designated Massachusetts Route 16. It crosses into Malden near Devir Park, shortly before it ends at the junction with Fellsway West and Fellsway East. The Medford and Malden portions of The Fellsway, including its medians and Wellington Circle, are part of the National Register listing for the Fells Connector Parkways.
Fellsway West.
Portions of the Fellsway West right of way were acquired in 1896; the rest were obtained in 1897. The eastern portion followed an existing alignment along Medford's Valley Street. The road runs west from the northern end of The Fellsway, soon after crossing Massachusetts Route 60 just across the Malden-Medford line in Medford. At Fulton Street the road turns north, paralleling Interstate 93 to Roosevelt Circle, which is were it terminated when completed in 1898. From Roosevelt Circle it continues northward into the Fells, in an extension constructed between 1905 and 1908, and was fully extended to Stoneham in 1931. The section from a point about north of Roosevelt Circle has been extensively altered due to the construction of I-93. Only the section between Fulton Street and The Fellsway is part of the National Register listing for the Fells Connector Parkways; the section immediately north of Roosevelt Circle is included in the Middlesex Fells Reservation Parkways listing. Fellsway West is designated Massachusetts Route 28 for its entire length.
Fellsway East.
Fellsway East runs north from the interchange with The Fellsway and Fellsway West, with its entire length in Malden, Melrose, and Stoneham. The oldest portion runs to East Border Road at the southern edge of the Fells, crossing Massachusetts Route 60 and passing Fellsmere Park. Except for a brief section, it is a broad multilane boulevard with an impressive tree canopy over the northern part, and is the best preserved section of the Fells Connector Parkways. From the junction with East Border Road, it becomes a narrow park road, passing into a heavily wooded section of the Fells Reservation in Melrose. It then becomes a border road, skirting the eastern edge of the reservation in Melrose before reaching its end at a junction with Pond Street and the Lynn Fells Parkway in Stoneham. The section of this parkway south of East Border Road is listed as part of the Fellsway Connector Parkways; the northern section is listed as part of the Middlesex Fells Reservation Parkways.
Alterations.
Several significant alterations have been made to these roadways since they were first laid out. Streetcar lines ran all the way along The Fellsway and Fellsway West from 1907 into the 1940s, and eventually reached all the way to Stoneham Square. This service was cut back to run only along the Fellsway, and completely discontinued in the 1950s. The Wellington Bridge, originally a drawbridge, was replaced in 1914. Roosevelt Circle was built (as a surface rotary) in the 1930s to address increasing traffic volume, and was replaced by the present aerial rotary with the construction of I-93 in the late 1950s. Wellington Circle, originally a rotary, was extensively redesigned in 1941 and again in 1956. The southernmost section of the The Fellsway was effectively obliterated by the construction of I-93 through Somerville.

Seidokaikan

History.
First formed in 1980 by Kazuyoshi Ishii, a former Kyokushin Karate practitioner who began his training under Hideyuki Ashihara in 1969. In 1980 Ishii left Kyokushin to join Ashihara's new style and organization, but after only a few months he left to form his own style and the Seidokaikan organization. Seidokaikan arranged several successful challenge events against other martial arts organizations, loosely based on the Kyokushin Knockdown karate rules as SeidoKaikan also allows grabbing. In 1993 Mr. Ishii founded the K-1 organization as a kickboxing organization, with many students from Seidokaikan. Seidokaikan is world renowned and also has international dojos in many countries including Australia.

Peter Reilly

Peter Reilly (26 November 1933 – 15 March 1977) was a Progressive Conservative party member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was a broadcaster and journalist by career.
He was elected at the Ottawa West riding in the 1972 general election and served his term 29th Canadian Parliament before being defeated in the 1974 election by Lloyd Francis of the Liberal party.
During his term as Member of Parliament, Reilly was in conflict with former Prime Minister and fellow party member John Diefenbaker whom he charged was undermining the leadership of Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield. This feud began in early 1973 when Stanfield, Reilly and other house members supported a federal bilingualism initiative, which Diefenbaker and several other members opposed.
Following his departure from Parliament, Reilly returned to broadcasting with CBC Television as one of the founding reporters of "the fifth estate". One of his reports was broadcast on the program 15 March 1977, the same day that he died at his Toronto residence from an apparent case of heart failure.

Gov. George S. Boutwell House is a historic house at 172 Main Street in Groton, Massachusetts that was home to Governor George S. Boutwell. It was built in 1851 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.
The Boutwell House is the current headquarters of the Groton Historical Society.
The house was built in 1851 for George S. Boutwell who was Governor of Massachusetts at the time. He and his family were the only occupants of the house and when his daughter Georgianna died in 1933 she left the house to the historical society.
Currently the Boutwell House is used to both display period furniture and decorative arts and showcase special exhibits in the rotating exhibit gallery.
"Light fills the front study inside the Greek Revival mansion, just the way it did a century and half ago when Gov. George Boutwell used to prepare his speeches there. The over-sized window looking over Station Avenue allowed him to see trains arrive from Boston. Boutwell would stand by the window and wave to guests getting off the train. Downstairs, inside the crimson-walled drawing room, Boutwell would entertain federal and state officials and dignitaries, including President Ulysses S. Grant for a night in 1869."
In 2010, the Boutwell House suffered two very serious water pipe failures which flooded portions of the museum’s exhibition and work areas. The Groton Historical Society's Board of Directors sought and obtained both a Community Preservation Act grant for $176,525 which was unanimously approved at Groton Town Meeting in April 2013, and a Cultural Facilities Fund grant for $79,000 awarded in November 2012 from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. Both of these grants were for physical renovations including new wiring and plumbing, plaster replacement, a fire suppression system, and a new furnace. The first round of work is was completed and the house was reopened on Oct 5, 2013.

Getty Designs

Getty Designs is an image website, web services suite, and online community platform. In addition to being a popular Web site for users to share interior design photographs, the service is widely used by designer as a photo repository. Its popularity has been fueled by its organization tools, which allow photos to be tagged and browsed by folksonomic means. It claims to host more than 1 million images. Getty Designs is the world's latest interior design photo bank.
History.
Getty Designs was developed by CosmoSun, a MSC Malaysia Status company that launched Getty Designs in December 2004. The service emerged from tools originally created for Cosmo's, a web-based software developer.
Early versions of Getty Designs focused on an images library with photo exchange capabilities. There was also an emphasis on collecting images found on the web rather than photographs taken by users. The successive evolutions focused more on the uploading and filing backend for individual users and the exchange function was buried in the site map.
In February 2008, Property2u acquired Getty Designs. During the week of, all content was migrated to Property2u server in Malaysia, resulting in all data being subject to Law of the Malaysia.
On July 2008, Getty designs updated its services from Free Photo Exchange Portal to Interior Design Photo Bank with more commercial benefit to user/members. This upgraded version of Getty Designs require membership registration with minimum subscription, along with a design and structural overhaul. For all intents and purposes, the current version is considered a stable release.
In August 2008 upload limits on member account were increased to unlimited (originally a 1GB per month limit).
Features.
Organization.
Getty Designs asks photo submitters to organize images using tags (a form of metadata), which allow searchers to find images concerning a certain topic such as place name or subject matter. Getty Designs provide access to images tagged with the most popular keywords. Because of its support for tags.
Images can be posted to the user's collection via email attachments. Getty Designs has increasingly been adopted by many designers as their primary photo storage site.
Filtering.
In August 2008, Getty Design introduced mandatory filtering of all photos and a process of central review of photos by staff to set levels of appropriateness. By default all Getty Designs accounts are set to the status appropriate for a general public.
The filter system of Getty Designs assumes that photos may be unsafe and should not be public until a staff person has validated that the material is safe. Until this happens, which could take up to a week/month, material cannot be viewed by persons without a valid Getty Designs account.

Juan Bernhardt

Juan Ramón Bernhardt Coradin (born August 31, 1953 in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic) is a retired professional baseball player whose career spanned 13 seasons. Bernhardt spent parts of four seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees (1976), and the Seattle Mariners (1977–79). As a member of the inaugural Mariners team in 1977, he hit the team's first home run. Over his major league career, he compiled a .238 batting average with 46 runs scored, 117 hits, 19 doubles, two triples, nine home runs, and 43 runs batted in (RBIs) in 154 games played.
The majority of Bernhardt's career was spent in the minor leagues. He began his professional career in 1971 with the Class-A Key West Sun Caps. In the minors, he would go on to play for the Class-A Fort Lauderdale Yankees (1972–73), the Double-A West Haven Yankees (1974–75), the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs (1975–76), the Triple-A San Jose Missions (1978), the Triple-A Spokane Indians (1979), the Triple-A Iowa Oaks (1979), the Triple-A Tabasco Plataneros, the Triple-A Campeche Piratas/Alacranes (1981–83), and the Triple-A Aguascalientes Rieleros. He served as a player-manager from 1981 to 1982.
Professional career.
New York Yankees.
On August 1, 1970, Bernhardt signed with the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent. Bernhardt made his professional baseball debut in 1971 in the Yankees minor league organization. With the Class-A Key West Sun Caps that year, he batted .249 with 25 runs scored, 82 hits, 15 doubles, two triples, one home run, and 31 runs batted in (RBIs) in 97 games played.

Bernhardt continued playing with the Class-A Fort Lauderdale Yankees in 1973. In only 37 games played that year, he batted .337 with 34 hits, four doubles, and one home run. After the season, the New York Yankees purchased his contract, adding him to their 40-man roster. Bernhardt attended spring training with New York in 1974, but was assigned to the Double-A West Haven Yankees before the start of the regular season. With West Have that year, Bernhardt batted .201 with 20 runs scored, 37 hits, six doubles, one triple, three home runs, and 19 RBIs in 60 games played.

That season would prove to be Bernhardt's last in the United States, however, from 1980 to 1983, he played in the Mexican League. In 1980, he joined the Triple-A Tabasco Plataneros. From 1981 to 1982, Bernhardt was the player-manager for the Triple-A Campeche Piratas/Alacranes Mexican League team, who represented Campeche, Mexico. His final professional baseball season was in 1983 when he again played with the Campeche Triple-A team, and the Triple-A Aguascalientes Rieleros, who were also members of the Mexican League.

Electoral district of Mount Lawley

Mount Lawley is an electorate in the state of Western Australia. Mount Lawley is named for the inner north-eastern Perth suburb of Mount Lawley which falls within its borders.
The seat was created at the 2007 redistribution from parts of Yokine and Perth, and has a long history in an earlier incarnation which existed from 1950 until 1989 as a reasonably safe Liberal Party seat which was held for 22 years by Ray O'Connor, who served as Premier in 1982–1983, although is now a marginal seat. It falls within the Electoral region of East Metropolitan.
As well as Mount Lawley, the suburbs of Yokine, Menora and Coolbinia are part of the district, as are sections of Dianella and Inglewood. Mount Lawley is bounded by Morley Drive, The Strand, Walter Road West, Eighth Avenue, Carrington Street, Central Avenue, Swan River foreshore, Summers Street, Lord Street, Walcott Street and Wanneroo Road.
History.
The original seat of Mount Lawley was created at the 1948 redistribution, at which three new metropolitan electorates were created to replace former northern and agricultural seats in Parliament. Its first member was elected at the 1950 election, and it was always a safe seat for the Liberal Party. At the redistribution, the neighbouring seat of North Perth became a Labor seat with booths from the abolished Perth electorate, so Arthur Abbott, the Liberal member for North Perth since 1939, contested and won Mount Lawley. He was ultimately defeated in the 1956 election by the Liberal member for Maylands, Edward Oldfield, who had resigned from the Liberal Party to contest the election. In the 1962 election, following another redistribution, Oldfield returned to Maylands, whilst North Perth MLA Ray O'Connor won in Mount Lawley. He was to serve the district for 22 years, and the State as a minister in the Court government and ultimately as Premier of Western Australia from 25 January 1982 until 19 February 1983. He resigned his seat the following year, and George Cash won the resulting by-election. The seat was abolished in the 1988 redistribution and divided between Maylands, Dianella and Perth.
The seat was recreated in the 2007 redistribution on similar boundaries to its original incarnation. The seat of Yokine, which covered much of the original Mount Lawley's area, was held by Liberal minister Dr Kim Hames until the 2001 election, when he was defeated by the Labor candidate and former Assistant Police Commissioner Bob Kucera. After it became clear Kucera did not have Premier Alan Carpenter's support, Kucera did not contest Labor preselection for the 2008 election, and journalist Karen Brown won the nomination unopposed. In June 2008, Kucera resigned from the Labor Party and expressed an intention to contest either Nollamara or Mount Lawley as an independent, though he ultimately contested neither. The 2008 state election saw Brown defeated by Liberal candidate Michael Sutherland.

Buck's Corner Historic District

Buck's Corner Historic District encompasses a cluster of formerly rural (now suburban) properties in eastern Wilmington, Massachusetts. The district covers , and includes six houses and three barns whose construction dates range from the late 17th to the late 19th centuries. Many of them have some association with the descendants of Roger Buck, who with his son Ephraim is said to have built the Ephraim Buck House (216 Wildwood Street) around the turn of the 18th century. Other houses in the district range along Woburn Street, south from Wildwood Street to Allenhurst Way. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.
The oldest portion of the Ephraim Buck House is believed to have been built c. 1704, with a second section added in the 1740s. Its exterior was restyled c. 1770 to give it Federal period styling, including a front door entry with 3/4 length sidelight windows and an entablature. The Daniel Eames House at 584 Woburn Street may also have been built by Ephraim Buck, c. 1714-23, and is a fairly typical early Georgian house. A third 18th century house, that at 604 Woburn Street, was originally believed to be 17th century in origin, but is more likely a Federal period construction from c. 1785-91.
The Jonathan Buck House (571 Woburn Street, c. 1795-1820) is an excellent local example of Federal architecture, and one of only a few period hip roofed houses in the town. It is the typical five bays wide and two deep, with a central doorway flanked by full-length sidelight windows and pilasters supporting a narrow entablature. The remaining contributing houses to the district were built later in the 19th century: the Henry Sheldon House (603 Woburn Street, c. 1861-62) is Italianate in style, and the John Howard Eames House (590 Woburn Street, c. 1883) is a Queen Anne Victorian. Three houses have 19th century barns that contribute to the district (as did the Ephraim Buck House until its barn was demolished).
Two houses within the district bounds do not contribute to its significance. One is a modern house (c. 1999) at 588 Woburn Street; the other, at 580 Woburn Street, was an Italianate house built c. 1856-75, but has been renovated in an historically insensitive manner. A Buck family house at 585 Woburn Street, dating to the late 18th century, was demolished not long before the district boundaries were drawn.

Ephraim Buck House

The Ephraim Buck House is a historic First Period house at 216 Wildwood Street in Wilmington, Massachusetts. Construction of the house has been dated to c. 1704 by deeds, although local histories suggest part of it may be older. Analysis of its framing suggests that it may have been built in phases: the first phase would have included the front half of the house, along with a central chimney, while the back portion of the house, along with a new chimney, would have been added later in the 18th century. The house is distinctive for having "Beverly jogs" on both sides of the house; this is a portion of the rear section that projects from the side of the house. The house was supposedly built by Roger Buck, an early colonial settler, and his son Ephraim, and was originally occupied by two families. Its exterior was restyled c. 1770 to give it Federal period styling, including a front door entry with 3/4 length sidelight windows and an entablature.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, and included in the Buck's Corner Historic District in 2003.

Bullard Farm

The Bullard Memorial Farm is a historic farm located at 7 Bullard Lane in Holliston, Massachusetts. 
History.
The Bullard Farm was first settled by Benjamin Bullard in approximately 1652. The land was purchased from local Native Americans, and conveyed under the Keynes Grant and approved by the Massachusetts General Court in 1649. Originally the farm was known as the Bullard Colonial Farm, but is now known as The Bullard Memorial Farm. The earliest Bullards were direct descendants of John and Robert Bullard, emigrants from England in 1635. The land was cleared and farmed up to and including the first decade of the twenty first century. An extensive collection of the families papers can be found in the library of the 19th Century Historical Museum at Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. The Bullard family owned the Bullard Farm property from about 1652 until 1916, when John Anson Bullard, the last Bullard family member to individually own the Bullard Farm property, bequeathed it to the Bullard Memorial Farm Association (“BMFA”), which had been created in 1909. There are nine buildings on site: a main house (1777/1794), a barn, a vinegar building, a cider building, a blacksmith shop, a library, a locker building, a small shed/horse barn, and a cottage. Approximately 100 acres of land is under a forestry and agricultural designation and the remaining 50 acres are undeveloped pasture. The property and land, as well as a historic cow tunnel, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Clark Houses

The Clark Houses are historic houses at 74 and 76 W. Central Street in Natick, Massachusetts. The houses were built in 1870 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
History.
The Clark Houses are significant as two of the finer examples of the Second Empire/mansard style in Natick, MA. They are also significant for their association with Edward Clark, a local entrepreneur.
Edward Clark was born in Natick in August 1838. He was the son of Nathaniel Clark, builder of the Clark Block in Natick Center, which is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Edward was established as a prominent Natick grocer by 1882. His business was housed in the Clark Block. He succeeded his father as town treasurer from 1889-1910, and while in office handled more than four million dollars. Edward was a director of the Natick National Bank, of which his father was a founder. During Edward's lifetime he also served as a trustee of the Morse Hospital and treasurer of the Park Cemetery Association. He died in 1910.
76 West Central Street, known as the "Mary Clark Whitney House," stands directly west of the Edward Clark House (#74). It is the second of five houses on West Central Street known as "the Clark Houses." The house was built by Edward Clark (owner of #74 and cousin of Mary Clark Whitney) for Mary and her husband James Whitney. The couple was socially prominent in the town of Natick. James Whitney, a native of Sherborn, MA, went into partnership in a Natick-based clothing business in 1857 with Alfred W. Mann, originally of Templeton, MA. The firm, Mann and Whitney went out of business following the Panics of 1857 and 1861. Mr. Whitney then joined the Natick Protective Clothing Company, and subsequently served as treasurer of the Natick Five Cents Savings Bank, a position he held until his death in July, 1889. Mary Clark Whitney, was born January 8, 1816, one of 13 children, to Alphonse and Nancy Leland Clark of Sherborn, MA. Both of Mrs. Whitney's grandfathers served in the Revolutionary War. The Natick Chapter of the DAR made her an honorary member, and planned "an observance" on the century mark of her birth on January 8, 1916. However, fate intervened, and on the morning of December 24, 1915, two weeks before her 100th birthday, Mrs. Whitney died quietly in her home of 45 years. Her obituary in the "Natick Bulletin", December 24, 1915, noted that "General sorrow was manifested on Wednesday by the people of Natick when it became known that its oldest woman, Mrs. James Whitney...had passed away in the night." Mary Clark Whitney was survived by her daughter, Mrs. Annie Bean, as well as Mrs. Bean's husband and two daughters, Madeline and Clara Bean.
Architecture.
Both buildings, at 74 and 76 West Central Street respectively, represent coherent examples of the Second Empire style. The house at 76 West Central Street is a three story, T-plan Second Empire structure set on a granite foundation. The main rectangle is three bays wide by two bays deep. The hip roofed ell attached to the rear elevation is two bays wide by two bays deep. The house is sheathed in beaded clapboards painted beige. Cornerboards and water-table are plain. The wide entablature is ornamented by irregularly placed paired brackets beneath the widely overhanging eaves. The high mansard roof is covered by fish scale slate tiles. Fenestration is 2/2 framed by plum-colored louvered shutters on the first two stories. First story windows are headed by a molded projecting cornice. Second story windows are headed by a triangular pediment with a boss at their center. The gable dormers contain 2/2 windows flanked by a stepped architrave and headed by an open triangular pediment.
The facade faces north toward West Central Street. A central projecting pavilion rises the full three stories, with the first story being an entrance portico. Paired Doric columns support the portico entablature with its bracketed corners. Narrow Doric pilasters frame double Italianate style "tombstone" entrance doors. The second story of the pavilion has a wide molded sill beneath double-arched 1/1 windows with a projecting flat cornice on the facade and a segmentally arched 1/1 window on both the east and the west sides of the projection. The gable dormer above has a segmentally arched window
The east elevation has a three-sided flat-roofed projection on the first story. The three sides are at 45-degree angles to one another. Each corner has two pairs of brackets beneath the cornice. Two windows stand above on the second story, with a dormer overhead. The east elevation of the ell has an open porch with a single window overhead on the second story.
The west elevation of the house has two windows on both stories. The west elevation of the ell has a second story window at the northern end and a first story window at the southern end.

CUF, Cincinnati

CUF is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. Its name is derived from the communities of Clifton Heights, University Heights, and Fairview. CUF is bordered by the neighborhoods of Clifton, the Heights, Mount Auburn, Over-the-Rhine, and Camp Washington.
University Heights occupies the northern area of CUF, and is separated from Fairview and Clifton Heights by Straight Street. Fairview occupies the south-west corner and Clifton Heights the south-east corner of CUF. Fairview and Clifton Heights are separated by Ravine Street; Fairview on the west, Clifton Heights on the east.
The neighborhood is governed by the City of Cincinnati.
Clifton Heights.
The residential area of Clifton Heights is largely rental property that functions as off-campus student housing, with many restaurants and convenience stores.
The Clifton Heights Business District of the fifties is completely gone and developed into businesses that cater to university students as there are few families remaining. Currently, the area has been essentially razed in hopes of more contemporary businesses while developers have yet to agree on an economically feasible plan. It is located in the area of McMillan Street and Calhoun Street between Vine/Jefferson and Clifton Avenue, immediately south of the University of Cincinnati campus. Currently, there remains the vacant but architecturally significant St. George School and church that so long as it remains acts as either a headstone or marker for the neighborhood around which these building were the heart.
Clifton Heights is home to the Hughes Center, a vocational and special-purpose high school. Its current Clifton Heights location was built in 1906. Currently there are five college prep schools housed at Hughes. The Paideia High School, the High School for Communications Professions and Health Professions, High School for Teaching and Technology and the Cincinnati Academy of Mathematics and Science (CAMAS). Clifton Heights is also home to the Kreuck recreation complex, a large indoor recreation center which is located on the campus of the Hughes Center. The Kreuck complex is a public facility operated by the Cincinnati Recreation Commission. Bellevue Hill, a city park located at Ohio Avenue, is well known for its overlook of downtown Cincinnati.
The Clifton Heights Community Urban Redevelopment Corporation (CHCURC) is committed to the revitalization of the Clifton Heights neighborhood. It was established as a partnership between the Clifton Heights Business Association, the Clifton Heights, University Heights, and Fairview Neighborhood Association, and the University of Cincinnati. CHCURC was responsible for the University Park Apartments development. 
Clifton Heights is sometimes called "Clifton," either intentionally shortened or not, by locals and non-locals. However, the actual Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton is just north of CUF.
University Heights.
University Heights is primarily a residential area, and like Clifton Heights and Fairview, there is an unusually high percentage of student-targeted rental property. However, unlike the other two neighborhoods, there is also a large contingent of owner-occupied single-family houses. University Heights is home to Good Samaritan Hospital.
Fairview.
Fairview is a residential area, with a very high percentage of rental property targeted at University of Cincinnati students. Many of these buildings are excellent examples of the Italianate form of architecture prominent in many of Cincinnati's older neighborhoods.
Fairview is known best as the former home of Fairvew German Language School, which was founded by the neighborhood's German community in 1888. In 2008 however the school was relocated to nearby Clifton.
The neighborhood's name comes from the view much of the area has of downtown Cincinnati, as Fairview is perched on one of many hillsides facing the city proper. Fairview Park, a park located at McMillan Street, has a long driving path with numerous overlooks.

Virginia Sand

Virginia Sand (November 23, 1928–February 13, 2007) graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in geology. Sand taught geology at Kent State University for three decades and was named Professor Emeritus of Geology in 1993. She was a longtime member of the Association of Women Geoscientists, a benefactor to the Wilderness Center in Wilmot, Ohio, and a board member of the Buckeye Trail Association. Her contributions to the field of geology were complemented and fueled by a thirst for world travel.
Education.
Born Virginia Murphy to parents James and Gladys Murphy, Virginia attended high school in Evanston, Illinois. After high school, she earned her undergraduate degree from Northwestern University in May, 1950. As an early female to earn a degree in geology, she received resistance from the department. One professor made deliberate attempts to thwart her studies by sending her repeatedly to the blackboard in an effort to embarrass her, openly admonishing her in front of classmates. While at Northwestern, she was also a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority.
Her formal education was interrupted in the 1950s when she married Martin B. Sand. After relocating to New Philadelphia, Ohio in 1954, the couple opened the Mart Sand Pontiac Dealership, and the business demanded attention. She also gave birth to three daughters, and divided her time between her children, the dealership, and giving Spanish lessons out of her home. It wasn't until the latter part of the 1960s that Sand enrolled at the main campus of Kent State University, earning her Master of Arts Degree in Teaching Earth Science in 1969.
Professor of Geology.
After receiving her masters degree, Sand spent the next three decades teaching geology at the Tuscarawas Campus of Kent State University. Encouraging her students to reach beyond their usual environment, Sand offered extra credit to students willing to travel outside of the region to expand their horizons. She was the recipient of the Distinguished Teaching Award in 1975, and the Most Popular Professor Award in 1977. In 1993, she was given the honor of being named Professor Emeritus of Geology. Sand retired in 1997.
Sand was a longtime member and had a place on the foundation board of the Association of Women Geoscientists, serving on their executive board as editor of the association newsletter from 1988 to 1991. She made countless contributions to the Wilderness Center in Wilmot, Ohio, where she served as docent and made regular donations. She was instrumental in the collection and erection of the fossil wall, the main feature of the Interpretive Building's foyer. To complete the wall, she personally travelled to the Natural History Museum at the Smithsonian to collect casts of fossils from the museum's collection. The Center recognized Sand's efforts by awarding her the Volunteer of the Year Award in 2003 for distinguished service. After her death in 2007, the Stark County Leave a Legacy Foundation awarded her its 2008 Philanthropist Award. The award was presented on May 7, 2008 by Gordon Maupin, executive director of the Wilderness Center, and accepted by Sand's daughter, Chris Sand-Ashley, and granddaughter, Elizabeth Eckel.
Sand was also involved in the Buckeye Trail Association as a board member and trailblazer. As a member of the American Institute of Professional Geologists, she conducted investigations for attorneys on such matters as landslides and damage from mines. She was a member of the American Association of University Women, the Nature Conservatory, and Mensa International, an invitational roundtable where membership includes only the most intelligent and gifted thinkers in the world. Sand served on the Staff Parish Committee for the First United Methodist Church in her community. She also taught Sunday school, directed the church's vacation Bible school, and served as their Superintendent of Education for one year.
Travel.
Sand dedicated much of her life to seeing the world, and continued her explorations even after losing her husband to Alzheimer's disease in 2001. Her journeys included trips to the Galapagos Islands, South America, Mexico, Hawaii, Mount St. Helens, Iguaca Falls, Turkey, Iceland, Ecuador, parts of Asia, and the Danube and Rhine Grand Circle in Europe. In January 2005 she made a trip to Antarctica, moving from island to island at the age of 76. In 1994 and 1995 she was a lecturer on cruise ships for the Cunard Line. She went on many geology trips to the Southwest United States, one of which took her to a ranch where a mastodon with an arrowhead in his ribs had been found, proving the coexistence of humans and mastodons 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.
Sand's ashes have been scattered by her family in the Colorado River of the Grand Canyon, whose rapids she conquered on nine separate occasions. Her enthusiasm for taking on new horizons was a key part of the legacy she imparted to her many students.

1940 Chatham Cup

The 1940 Chatham Cup was the 17th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand, and the last such competition before the suspension of the Chatham Cup due to World War II. The competition resumed in 1945 as hostilities were drawing to a close.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Ponsonby, Waterside (Wellington), Hamilton Wanderers, Nomads (Christchurch), and Mosgiel.
The 1940 final.
Waterside successfully defended the trophy for a second consecutive time, becoming the first team to win the trophy three times. The final also saw the first re-match since 1925, with the two teams having previously met in the 1938 final. Eight Waterside players (Sid Ward, Bob Bolton, Fred Hazel, Colin McCarthy, Tom Walker, Sonny Ward, Alf Longbottom, and Toby Janes) played in all three finals, and eight Mosgiel players played in both the 1938 and 1940 finals. Bolton, Janes, and Walker were each to gain a fourth final win in 1947.
Sonny Ward scored in the third consecutive final, taking his tally of cup final goals to four, and McCarthy added a hat-trick to his two goals in the previous season's final to take his overall total to a then-record five. The final was played in front of a record crowd of 8,000 spectators. Contemporary reports say that the final was the most one-sided in the cup's history up to that time. Despiute this, Mosgiel took an early lead with a second-minute goal from A. Sharpe. The equaliser came from Sonny Ward after 25 minutes, and from that point it became one-way traffic. Walker put Waterside into the lead and McCarthy added another only two minutes later. McCarthy added a further goal to give the Wharfies a 3-1 half-time lead. In the second half McCarthy added his third and then crossed the ball from a corner which Longbottom headed in for Waterside's sixth. Mosgiel gained a late consolation goal through W. Rogers.
The aggregate of eight final goals remains a record, though it has been eqaualled on five occasions, in 1955, 1958, 1960, 1989, and in the first final of 1972 (a year in which the final required two replays).
1941 to 1944.
Owing to World War II, competition for the Chatham Cup was shelved from 1941 to 1944. Major reasons were the commitments of players to the war effort and the use of fuel to carry teams between game venues at a time when the use of fuel was severely restricted. In announcing the suspension of the competition in April 1941, NZFA chairman Frank Campbell stated: "The council is reluctant to see the Chatham Cup competition stopped, but in all the circumstances considers the postponement of the competition for this season in the best interests of the country and the game." The question of reviving the competition was put to the council each year during the war,but it was not until 1945 that it was revived. In 1944, a junior competition for schoolboys, known as the N.Z. Boys' Chatham Cup and run on similar regional lines to the senior competition, was contested by 13 teams.

Corryville, Cincinnati

Corryville is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio, east of the University of Cincinnati, southeast of Clifton, south and west of Avondale, northwest of Walnut Hills, and north of Mount Auburn. 
The original owners of part of the land were Jacob Burnet and William McMillan. The neighborhood's namesake, William Corry, was an early mayor of Cincinnati and himself a prominent landowner in the Corryville area. German Americans largely settled the village of Corryville, moving north up the hillside from the congested Over-the-Rhine basin. Corryville was annexed to the City of Cincinnati in 1870.
Its most famous street is probably Short Vine, which contains several small shops, bars, adult stores, and the music venue Bogart's. The Corryville restaurant known as Mecklenburg's Garden is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it has operated since at least 1870.

Franklin and David Thomas (both died 13 February 1995) were convicted murderers who were executed by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG). Their executions, along with that of Douglas Hamlet, are the most recent executions performed by SVG, and questions about the fairness of the Thomas brothers' execution have been raised.
Franklin and David Thomas were convicted of murder and received mandatory death sentences. After their appeal to SVG appeal courts failed, they were notified on Friday, 9 February 1995 that their executions would take place the following Monday morning. However, they still had a legal right to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) in London, which is the supreme court for SVG. The brothers were executed by hanging early on Monday morning before having lodged an appeal with the JCPC. Amnesty International and other organizations found out about the scheduled executions approximately 36 hours before they took place.

WCNU played a country-western format for its listeners in the Northwest Florida/South Alabama area. It was known as the "Community Station" and for playing "Dixie" before and after the news in the morning. The station was also known for signing off every evening to "Canadian Sunset."
In the late 1950s, WCNU and WDSP were owned and operated by W.D. "Cooter" Douglass and his wife, Marie. In 1959, citing his actions "in the spirit of emphasizing the public interest" and his "faithful reporting of the news and fearless comment thereon from Radio Stations WDSP, DeFuniak Springs and WCNU, Crestview", the Florida Legislature passed a resolution designating U.S. Route 90 passing through Walton and Okaloosa counties as the "William D. "Cooter" Douglass Highway."
WCNU was purchased by Jerry W. Milligan, Sr. in the late 1970s. In 1980, Milligan changed the format of the station to light rock/pop music and, in September 1983, increased its power to 10,000 watts. The new format and high power significantly increased the station's listener appeal and listener area. WCNU went out of business in 1989.
Licensed to Eagle International Broadcasting Inc., based in Pensacola, Florida, WCNU's final FCC license expired on February 1, 1996 and it was cancelled and deleted from the FCC database on August 29, 1996.
Trivia.
On the January 11, 2009 episode of the CBS crime drama "Cold Case" titled "Breaking News", a reporter from a fictional Philadelphia TV station named WCNU was murdered.
In the 2005 film, "The Dukes of Hazzard", a TV reporter purportedly from the local TV station identified the station as WCNU.

Franz Riegel

Franz Riegel (February 9, 1843 - August 26, 1904) was a German internist and gastroenterologist who was a native of Brückenau.
He studied medicine at the University of Würzburg, and following graduation furthered his studies in Vienna with Johann von Oppolzer (1808-1871). Afterwards he returned to Würzburg as an assistant to Heinrich von Bamberger (1822-1888), and later Carl Gerhardt (1833-1902). In 1871 he was a lecturer of experimental pathology at the University of Würzburg, and in 1874 became director of the Cologne city hospital. In 1879 he was appointed to the chair of medicine at the University of Giessen, where he would remain until his death in 1904.
Riegel's research involved studies of the respiratory system, vasomotor influences, the effects of substances such as caffeine, atropine and jaborandi, conditions of the heart and blood pressure in nephritis, et al. He is remembered for his extensive research of gastric disorders; his last written work discussing distinctions between hyperacidity and hypersecretion.
His best known written work was "Die Erkrankungen des Magens" (1896), (The Diseases of the Stomach), a book that was later translated into English.

St George's RC Primary School

St. George's RC Primary School is a mixed Roman Catholic primary school serving the city centre Parish of St. George in York, North Yorkshire, England. The school is for boys and girls aged 3–11 with an Early Years Unit for 3-5 year olds. It is a successful school with notable strengths in Creativity and the Performing Arts.
The History of St. George's.
Although girls had been educated at the Bar Convent since its inception in 1686 the first public Catholic School in York was opened by the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1844 on their premises in Blossom Street and called ‘St Mary’s Day School’. In 1852 a new school was built in Margaret Street adjacent to St George’s Church at a cost of £1,700. Of this £200 was given by the Catholic Poor Schools’ Committee and the rest raised by the people of York and an income of £23 was secured as an endowment. This school was staffed first by the IBVM until 1874 and later by the Sisters of Charity, the Order founded by St Vincent de Paul in 1633. The curriculum included spelling, writing, geography, arithmetic and history and parents were expected to subscribe a penny or twopence for girls.
By 1867 there were 305 on the roll, and by 1900 the numbers had risen to 534. Because of this increase St George’s Wesleyan Chapel in Chapel Row built in 1824 was purchased in 1897, modified and extended and opened as a new junior and infant school in 1900, this was the precursor of the present school.
In 1950 our current school building was planned, but various delays meant that work did not begin until May 1976 and was completed in September 1977 at a cost of over £200,000. The general plan consists of three units of twinned classrooms,each sharing a project area built around a central hall, together with a Nursery and Reception Area, an administrative block, kitchen and a caretaker’s house. The school stands in impressive grounds, complete with gardens, a playing field and a newly constructed allotment. It is situated not far from the city centre on Fishergate.
The school.
St. George's is noted for its strengths in Creativity and the Performing Arts. It has been awarded the Gold Arts Mark, and has strong links with local theatres and professional performers. St. George's achieved the 'Healthy School' award for its commitment to PE, sport and healthy lifestyle education. The school also holds the Basic Skills Quality Mark and the Football Association Charter Standard. St. George's offers a wide range of extra curricular activities, both during and after school, including:
Recent OfSTED Report.
"Pupils are happy, enjoy school and behave well. Those who join throughout each year group are welcomed and quickly make friends because pupils get on well and are very caring. Relationships are strong. Pupils are respectful, confident to take initiative and keen to take on responsibilities. All this helps them in their learning and prepares them well for their future. The school provides a good level of care for its pupils and is successful in promoting their personal development through a lively extended community". OfSTED (2006: 2)
"The curriculum is enlivened through interesting activities including performing arts, which the school promotes well. A good range of well attended extra-curricular opportunities brings added enjoyment for pupils". OfSTED (2006: 4)
"Pupils are punctual, enjoy school and describe lessons as ‘fun’. Relationships between staff and pupils are good. Pupils’ mature attitudes enhance their learning. For instance, they particularly enjoy and benefit from working collaboratively. Pupils’ spiritual, moral and social development is good and at the heart of the school. This generates a unity of purpose and provides pupils with a good understanding of how they can contribute to the wider community". OfSTED (2006: 5)

Tim Flach

Tim Flach Hon FRPS (born 1958, London, United Kingdom) is a London based photographer, artist and director, with work in several major international public collections, including the National Media Museum, UK and the Swedish Museum of Natural History. He is best known for his highly conceptual images of animals... ...using principles of human portraiture… and a vocabulary of gestures and looks which seem to echo our own and play on our predispositions and sympathies. He is the author of the books "Evolution", "Equus", "Dogs Gods", and "More Than Human".
__TOC__
Education and work.
Tim Flach studied Communications Design at the North East London Polytechnic (1977–1980) and then Photography and Painted Structures at Saint Martin's School of Art (1982–1983). He soon began to attract commissions and was working independently from 1983 and has since then contributed to the likes of National Geographic, Smithsonian Magazine, The Sunday Times, The New York Times and New Scientist. His fine art prints are represented in London by the Osborne Samuel Gallery.
Photography.
Flach's work has increasingly focused on animals, ranging widely across species but united by a distinctive style that is derived from his concerns with anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism. His interests lie in the way ‘We shape animals, and we shape their meaning. Whether genetically, as with the featherless chicken of my photograph, or with the symbolism that gives a special significance to a dove but dismisses a London pigeon as a flying rat.’ He states that his images ‘aim to illuminate … the relationships between human and non human animals - to make an enquiry into how these relationships occupy anthropocentric space within the contexts of ethics, history, science and politics.’ Flach’s images have been described as a system for thinking, constructed and questioned by animal imagery: "Nobel Prize-winner author Elias Canetti penned an aphorism that could easily be applied to Flach – a person who 'thinks in animals as others think in concepts'."
Flach’s often abstract photographic style has been described as “the perfect antithesis to anthropomorphism”. "Flach employs the artistic technique of defamiliarization in many of his studio portraits, creating deliberately ambiguous close-ups, which present the subject at unusual angles in order to provoke questions from the viewer." Surrounding many of these images, like a filter or a screen, is a sense of exploring the concept of Umwelt – the unique way of reading the physical environment that each species inevitably has. Flach’s inquiry is at once highly intellectual, subtly political, and at the same time charmingly visual. There are multiple agendas being explored that confront us with our behaviour in and around other living things.
Books.
Evolution, 2013
"Evolution" is a collection of Flach’s photography over the past fifteen years, and is an overview of the many ideas he has explored during his career.‘Flach’s photos show great respect for animals, nature and, if you like, creation in its entirety’ He is interested in using animals as 'biological objects', not framing them in the traditional confines in which a photograph of an animal is placed, and asks, what do these animals represent to us?, and how do we know and understand animals?, stating that ’Nature’s blueprint is very different from what we humans make of it.’
More Than Human, 2012
"More Than Human", is a photographic exploration of animal species ranging from mammals to marine creatures to insects. By removing the creatures from their natural environments, and shooting in a minimal studio setting, the images take on a curiously ‘portrait-like’appearance, usually distinct to humans. Essays by author and creative director Lewis Blackwell and the foreword by Flach, explore the idiosyncrasies of particular creatures as well as pertinent ethical, political, cultural and scientific issues surrounding the relationships between human and non human animals.
Dogs Gods, 2010
Flach's second book is a study of canines. It focuses on the diversity of dog breeds, revealing how their forms and capabilities provide a mirror to human development and identity over millions of years. Ahead of publication, The Economist's Intelligent Life magazine ran a 12-page feature, noting how the images were in part a visual exploration of research into sensation and perception, such as the work of neuroscientist Morton L. Kringelbach. The article said "Flach's bestiary, apparently so self-contained and stylised, often reveals unexpected layers of meaning.”
Equus, 2008
"Equus", is a comprehensive photographic study of equus: “the family of animals: that goes from Ass to Zebra, but is mostly Horses” The studies in Equus fall into three categories; the first contains a range of close-up studio portraits, the second explores how location has played a part in shaping the horse, and the third examines the myriad ways humanity has shaped the horse.

Navigation Catalyst Systems

Navigation Catalyst Systems, previously known as Vendare, First Look, and qsrch.net, is a pay-per-click advertising company that specializes in monetizing parked domain names and registrars' wildcard DNS records. Navigation Catalyst Systems is a subsidiary of New.net and an affiliate of the ICANN-accredited registrar Basic Fusion.
Lawsuit.
In 2007, Navigation Catalyst Systems, along with its affiliate registrar Basic Fusion, was sued by Verizon for the registration and domain tasting of 1,392 domain names incorporating Verizon's trademarks (Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 2008 WL 2651163 (C.D. Cal. June 30, 2008). Navigation argued that it did not register the domain names in bad faith because it had used a proprietary software tool that, through both manual and automatic means, "scrubbed" its registered domains for registered trademarks. It claimed that it was merely "reserving" the domain names by taking advantage of Basic Fusion's Add Grace Period. Basic Fusion attempted to argue that it was not the same legal entity as Navigation Catalyst Systems, but the court stated that they were the same for the purposes of a preliminary injunction motion. 
Navigation further asserted an unclean hands defense, arguing that Verizon used a similar pay-per-click program to monetize its wildcard DNS records. The court rejected both arguments and ultimately granted a preliminary injunction against Navigation Catalyst Systems. In so doing, the court held that Navigation Catalyst Systems had intended to profit in bad faith from the typographical errors of Internet users that mistyped Verizon's trademarks in the URL bar of their web browsers:
It is clear that their intent was to profit from the poor typing abilities of consumers trying to reach Plaintiffs' sites: what other value could there be in a name like ve3rizon.com? Further, the sites associated with these names often contained links to products directly competitive with Plaintiffs' cellphone and internet businesses, potentially diverting consumers who would otherwise have purchased goods or services from Plaintiffs away from Plaintiffs.

Chukochya River

The Chukochya River or Bolshaya Chukochya River is a river in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) of the Russian Federation. It crosses the tundra roughly northeastwards and flows into the Kolyma Gulf of the East Siberian Sea west of the mouths of the Kolyma River. Its mouth is located at 70.1 N, 159.7667 E. Owing to its extreme northerly location the Chukochya River freezes up in early October and remains icebound until June. 
The Chukochya River basin is located between the basins of the Alazeya and the Kolyma.
There are study sites near the Chukochya River in order to investigate the mineral transformations in the soils affected by permafrost.
The Chukochya or Bolshaya Chukochya River in mainland Eastern Siberia should not be confused with the Chukochya River on Kotelny Island, the largest of the New Siberian Islands.
Ecology.
The Kolyma Lowlands, the area where the Chukochya flows, is full of lakes and marshes. A great variety of birds, like Siberian cranes, waders and sandpipers, make their habitat in this riverine area.
Fossil insects, early Pleistocene equids and mammoths have been found in the basin of the Chukochya River.

Gowing-Sheldon Historic District

The Gowing—Sheldon Historic District is a historic district containing two formerly rural properties, at 642 and 643 Woburn Street in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The district's houses are reminders of a period when the area was rural farmland along one of the oldest roads in town. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.
Gowing/Sheldon House.
The Gowing/Sheldon House at 642 Woburn Street is a Federal style wood frame house built c. 1809. Like many period houses, it faces south and rests on a granite foundation; however, it is only four bays wide and one bay deep. There is a rear ell perpendicular to the main house that was added sometime before the turn of the 20th century, and has been modified since, based on photographic evidence. This ell connects the house to a 19th century barn.
This house was built by Joel Tweed, a cordwainer who bought the property in 1809 and sold it, with house, in 1819. It was acquired in 1920 by John Gowing, who is reported in local histories to have raised a large family there. He sold the property in 1864 to Horace Sheldon, whose family owned the property until 1898.
Lucy and Henry Sheldon House.
In 1892, Lucy Sheldon purchased land across the street from the Sheldon house from her father-in-law, Henry, who was Horace's brother. The house that Lucy ahd Henry, Jr. built in 1893 is one of the most elaborate Queen Anne houses in Wilmington. The house has cross gables expanding the third floor, its gables decorated with cut shingles and heavy brackets. A single story porch is decorated with turned posts and jigsaw brackets. The entry is highlighted by a gable end decorated with a starburst. In the back of the property is a carriage house, which carries on the Queen Anne styling.

Groton Leatherboard Company

Groton Leatherboard Company is a historic former factory complex at 6 W. Main Street in West Groton, Massachusetts. It manufactured leatherboard, an artificial leather made by pulping and compressing scrap leather, waste paper and wood pulp, but went out of business. The structure has since been renovated and adapted into senior housing called RiverCourt Residences. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.
The factory was built in 1916 on the site of an earlier saw and grist mill, which operated by waterpower from the Squannacook River. The original mill was established by the Tarbell family, a name prominent in Groton history since its settlement. The present complex's access road is flanked by brick houses built by brothers of that family; the Col. Abel Tarbell House is today a bed-and-breakfast, while the Asa Tarbell House is a mixed-use annex of the River Court senior housing facility. In 1862, artist Edmund C. Tarbell was born in the latter.

Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge

Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge was formed in 1994. It is composed of of pine flatwoods, oak rides and coastal marsh. This diverse habitat is an example of the natural coastline of Lake Pontchartrain surrounded by fast developing communities.
Wildlife.
Endangered wildlife in the refuge are red-cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle and brown pelican. Other wildlife include rabbit, turkey, various neo-tropical birds, deer, squirrel, migratory waterfowl, and wading birds.
Habitat.
The refuge has unique habitat zones that contain diverse combinations of plant communities. These zones begin with the sandy beach fringing Lake Pontchartrain. Moving inland, the next zone is the brackish marsh. The third zone has a water level that is slightly below the marsh floor and the predominate plants are wiregrass and spike rush. The farthest inland plant zone is the upland zone and it consists of pine flatwoods and bottomland hardwood hammocks.
Hurricane damage.
The facilities at Big Branch Marsh NWR were damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The Boy Scout Road Trail boardwalk was destroyed but a new and improved boardwalk was built in early 2007. The other facilities on the refuge have been repaired or rebuilt. Sections of marsh vegetation were damaged and thousands of trees were destroyed or damaged. We planted trees on the refuge in 2006, 2007, and 2008. A marsh restoration project is scheduled for 2008 in the Goose Point and Point Platte areas and Christmas tree fences have been placed in some areas of the marsh. Discarded Christmas trees placed in these fences slow wave action, trap sediments, and combat erosion.

Allen County Athletic Conference

The Allen County Athletic Conference (ACAC) is an eight-member Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) conference. While all of its charter schools are and were located in Allen County, it also has member schools from Adams, De Kalb, and Wells counties. The ACAC, along with the Porter County Conference, are the only two county conferences left in existence.
History.
The Allen County Athletic Conference began with nine schools in Allen County in 1956. The schools were smaller, rural schools, with the exception of Elmhurst, the sole Fort Wayne school that wasn't included in the Fort Wayne City Series. The conference was hit hard by consolidation, and the nine original schools were down to four by the 1968 season (and two of those were new consolidations). The conference responded by going outside county borders by admitting Norwell (itself a newly consolidated school) in 1967, followed by Adams Central, Churubusco, and Eastside in 1968. The rebooted conference now expanded well outside of the Allen County footprint, including schools from Adams, DeKalb, Wells, and Whitley counties. All of the schools now sponsored football, and competition in that sport began in 1969.
The conference went to a two division format in 1971 with the addition of new school Homestead and Southern Wells. That format ended in 1975, as Homestead left for the Northeastern Indiana Athletic Conference, followed by Eastside leaving for the Northeast Corner Conference in 1980. The breakup of the NEIAC in 1989 led to a wide-scale realignment of conferences in Northeast Indiana, as schools looked to realign themselves with rivals of similar enrolments. The ACAC became the home for mid-sized schools, while the Northeast Corner housed small schools, and the newly formed Northeast Hoosier Conference became the stable for the largest non-Fort Wayne schools. Carroll and Norwell left that year for the NEHC, while Churubusco left for the NECC. They were replaced by NEIAC schools Bluffton and South Adams. Garrett, becoming too large for the Northeast Corner, moved to the Allen County league in 2005.

Groton Inn

The Groton Inn was a historic inn on Main Street in Groton, Massachusetts.
The Old Groton Inn was an inn consisting of three historic structures located in Groton, Massachusetts. The oldest structure was complete in 1678, making the inn the oldest in the United States. From 1797 until 1847 the inn served as a meeting place for St. Paul's Masonic Lodge, where Paul Revere was Grand Master. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The inn was severely damaged by fire in August 2011. Attempts were made to save the front of the building, which was barely harmed by a fire which severely damaged the rest of the structure, but the owners chose to demolish the inn in November 2011.
As of Fall 2013, a restoration developer is seeking approval for a new Groton Inn on the site of the original building.

<doc id="18765119" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18765119" title="Gas pycnometer">
Gas pycnometer

A gas pycnometer is a laboratory device used for measuring the density — or more accurately the volume — of solids, be they regularly shaped, porous or non-porous, monolithic, powdered, granular or in some way comminuted, employing some method of gas displacement and the volume:pressure relationship known as Boyle's Law. A gas pycnometer is also sometimes referred to as a helium pycnometer.
Types of gas pycnometer.
Gas expansion pycnometer.
Gas expansion pycnometer is also known as constant volume gas pycnometer. The simplest type of gas pycnometer (due to its relative lack of moving parts) consists of two chambers, one (with a removable gas-tight lid) to hold the sample and a second chamber of fixed, known (via calibration) internal volume – referred to as the reference volume or added volume. The device additionally comprises a valve to admit a gas under pressure to one of the chambers, a pressure measuring device – usually a transducer – connected to the first chamber, a valved pathway connecting the two chambers, and a valved vent from the second of the chambers. In practice the sample may occupy either chamber, that is gas pycnometers can be constructed such that the sample chamber is pressurized first, or such that it is the reference chamber that starts at the higher pressure. Various design parameters have been analyzed by Tamari. The working equation of a gas pycnometer wherein the sample chamber is pressurized first is as follows:
where "Vs" is the sample volume, "Vc" is the volume of the empty sample chamber (known from a prior calibration step), "Vr" is the volume of the reference volume (again known from a prior calibration step), "P"1 is the first pressure (i.e. in the sample chamber only) and "P"2 is the second (lower) pressure after expansion of the gas into the combined volumes of sample chamber and reference chamber.
Derivation of the "working equation" and a schematic illustration of such a gas expansion pycnometer is given by Lowell "et al.".
Variable volume pycnometer.
Variable volume pycnometer (or gas comparison pycnometer) consists of either a single or two variable volume chambers. The volume of the chamber(s) can be varied by either a fixed amount by a simple mechanical piston of fixed travel, or continuously and gradually by means of a graduated piston. Resulting changes in pressure can be read by means of a transducer, or nullified by adjustment of a third ancillary, graduated variable-volume chamber. This type of pycnometer is commercially obsolete; in 2006 ASTM withdrew its standard test method D2856 for the open-cell content of rigid cellular plastics by the air pycnometer, which relied upon the use of a variable volume pycnometer, and was replaced by test method D6226 which describes a gas expansion pycnometer.
Practical use.
Volume vs density.
While pycnometers (of any type) are recognized as density measuring devices they are in fact devices for measuring volume only. Density is merely calculated as the ratio of mass to volume; mass being invariably measured on a discrete device, usually by weighing. The volume measured in a gas pycnometer is that amount of three-dimensional space which is inaccessible to the gas used, i.e. that volume within the sample chamber from which the gas is excluded. Therefore the volume measured considering the finest scale of surface roughness will depend on the atomic or molecular size of the gas. Helium therefore is most often prescribed as the measurement gas, not only is it of small size, it is also inert and the most ideal gas. 
Closed pores, i.e. those that do not communicate with the surface of the solid, are included in the measured volume. Helium may however demonstrate some measurable permeability through low density solids (polymers and cellulosic materials predominantly) thus interfering with the measurement of solid volume. In such cases larger molecule gases such as nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride are beneficial.
Adsorption of the measuring gas should be avoided, as should excessive vapor pressure from moisture or other liquids present in the otherwise solid sample.
Applications.
Gas pycnometers are used extensively for characterizing a wide variety of solids such as heterogeneous catalysts, carbons, metal powders, soils, ceramics, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) and excipients, petroleum coke, cement and other construction materials, cenospheres/glass microballoons and solid foams.

Queensgate, Cincinnati

Queensgate is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. It sits in the same valley as Downtown Cincinnati and has been dominated by industrial and commercial warehouses for most of its history. Cincinnati's nickname of "Porkopolis" started here with hog slaughtering in the early 19th century. 
Queensgate was formerly simply known as part of the West End, Cincinnati. The City Plan for Cincinnati of 1948 called for slum clearance, and beginning in 1960 large tracts of the historic West End were razed. This "Urban renewal" project resulted in what is now the industrial area of Queensgate.
Queensgate is home of the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. From 1884 until 1970 the Cincinnati Reds played baseball at Crosley Field, which was located at the intersection of Findlay and Western Streets in Queensgate. The former site of home plate of Crosley Field has been painted in an alley.

The J. Neely Johnson House is a Greek Revival style Neoclassical historic home built in 1853, located at 1029 F Street in Sacramento, California.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1976.
History.
The house was constructed in 1853 for William Cozzens, a horticulturalist from New England, who made his way to California via Panama. Mr. Cozzens couldn't pay the builder and lost the house in court that same year. J. Neely Johnson, fourth Governor of California who served from 1856 until 1858, lived in the home prior to his term as Governor. A press report in 1856 noted that Johnson gave a brief speech from the balcony prior to being escorted to the State Capitol for his inauguration. Johnson was a lawyer by trade who moved to California during the 1849 California Gold Rush. Selden A. McMeans, State Tresurer of California elected in 1853, purchased the home in 1854 and later sold it in January 1856 to David S. Terry, California Supreme Court Justice. Terry resided there during the time of his infamous duel with Senator David Broderick who was shot by Terry and died three days later. Johnson, McMeans and Terry were prominent members of the American Party, also called the "Know Nothings" because of the secretive nature of their dealings. It is speculated that the Party conducted some of their private meetings at this home.

Harnden Tavern

The Harnden Tavern, also known as the Col. Joshua Harnden Tavern, is a historic tavern that was built in 1770 at 430 Salem Street in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
The Col. Joshua Harnden Tavern was built during the last third of the eighteenth century in the town of Wilmington, Massachusetts. The site is on Lot No. One in the "Land of Nod," in the most northerly part of the Charlestown Grant. This imposing structure is an excellent surviving example of late-Georgian architecture. Joshua Harnden was the great-grandson of Richard Harnden, the first Englishman to settle in what is now North Wilmington. Joshua and his wife Sarah (Cornell) and their six children were the first family to occupy this house. During the Revolutionary War, Joshua served in Capt. Timothy Walker's Militia Co. Later he attained the rank of colonel shortly before his retirement. Joshua was elected to serve the Town of Wilmington as one of its three selectmen. After the Revolutionary War, he opened his home to the public as an inn or tavern. Col. Harnden died on Sept. 9, 1807. His wife died on Aug. 9, 1816. The property was sold to Dr. Silas Brown in 1818. It remained in the Brown - Hathaway family for 125 years. There is credible tradition that the tavern was used as a station on the Underground Railroad prior to the Civil War. 
The building was taken by the town by eminent domain in 1973, and presently houses the Wilmington Town Museum.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

Tucker L. Viemeister (born August 14, 1948) is an American industrial designer who is leading Viemeister Industries in New York. Tucker helped found many important design businesses: frogdesign NY, Razorfish, Smart Design, Springtime-USA, and was Chief of the Lab at the Rockwell Group. He helped design the influential and award-winning Oxo "Good Grips" kitchen tools. He holds 32 US utility patents.
Vice President of the Architectural League of New York, Viemeister is also a Fellow of the Industrial Designers Society of America. His work is represented in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco; and the Staatliches Museum, Berlin, Germany. His numerous awards include 11 selections in the Annual Design Review of "ID Magazine", and the first Presidential Design Award in 1984.
Early life and education.
Born in Yellow Springs, Ohio as the oldest of four children, Tucker Viemeister was named for a car his father was designing at the time, 1948 Tucker Sedan. Read Viemeister (1923–1993) was an industrial designer, FIDSA, and founded Vie Design Studios with Budd Steinhilber. His mother Beverly Lipsett Viemeister (1927–2005) made many contributions to the Yellow Springs community before completing her degree in secondary education at Antioch College in 1965 and earning her master's in social work in 1968. After that she worked in social services. They had four children: Tucker, Kris, Heidi and Roslyn.
With his brother Kris, Tucker opened a jewelry shop called "Ohio Silver". They designed, crafted and sold fine jewelry, stained glass, leather work, and anything else they could make. He went to the Antioch School and Yellow Springs High School. 
Viemeister studied for two years at Shimer College, including a year in Oxford, England; Shimer has operated a study abroad program at Oxford University since the early 1960s. He ultimately graduated from Pratt Institute in 1974 with a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design (BID). He helped his Pratt Institute classmate Ted Muehling start his jewelry career.
Career.
In 1979, Viemeister began working with Davin Stowell, and six years later they founded Smart Design, Inc. Their most successful products are the award-winning Oxo "Good Grips" universal kitchen tools, the advanced technology Serengeti sunglasses and their packages and catalogs, Black & Decker's best-selling Metropolitan toaster, the ergonomic/psychonomic Home Phones for Cicena, the breakthrough Tea Brewer for Cuisinart, and wacky Joe Boxer watches with Nicholas Graham for Timex. Their emphasis has been on comfortable, practical, fun stuff.
In 1997, Hartmut Esslinger asked him to open a "frogdesign" studio in New York City. "Genius Watch" in "BusinessWeek" said: "Two of the most famous and mercurial figures in the product-design world are linking up." From 1999 to 2001, Viemeister carried a new dimension to the digital giant, Razorfish. As Executive Vice President, Research & Development, he built the physical industrial design capabilities and helped direct Razorfish on a global level. He created internal programs like "Flying Fish," "School of Fish" and "science projects." In 2001, Tucker became President of Springtime-USA. He opened the American branch of the Dutch design firm, Springtime, a global strategic consultancy for clients such as Heineken, Nike, Toyota, and PTTPost (the Dutch postal service). 
Viemeister began working with architectDavid Rockwell in 2001. They founded the multi-disciplinary collaborative "Studio Red", dedicated to innovation for Coca-Cola. Tucker is now Lab Chief, heading research and development at the Rockwell Group. The Lab encompasses digital interaction design, the material and image library, modeling and prototyping resources. the Lab focus is to explore the human relationship with technology, and its effect on experience. This activity includes: science and technology consultation, in-house design and creation of interactive environments/objects, and maintaining networks of technology solution providers. Key projects were the JetBlue terminal 5 Market Place at JFK, the interactive introduction installation for the Venice Architecture Biennale and the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas.
In 2012, Viemeister joined Ralph Appelbaum Associates to design exhibitions, he worked on the Boris Yeltsin Center and the New York Experience before hurricane Sandy flooded the building and cut their collaboration short. In the same year, he established Viemeister Industries as a platform to support his work.
The designer was called “Guru” by "BusinessWeek" (8/97), a “scruffy brand-meister” by the "Architect’s Newspaper" (2/06), and "Industrial Design’s Elder Wunderkind" when "ID" included him in America's hottest 40. In 2007 "New York" magazine recognized him as a “Living Design Innovator”
Marriage and family.
He married Sarah Verdone (1965–2010), a freelance writer and blogger who worked for "I.D." magazine. They had two daughters together, Josephine and Louisa, and lived in New York. Verdone died in March 2010. 
Together with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (LMCC), her family and associates established a new annual literary award in her name. It was awarded for the first time in May 2011 to the writer Emily Rubin, for her work, including her debut novel "Stalina" (2011).
Academic and civic activities.
Viemeister serves as chair of the Rowena Kostellow Fund, on the board of the Architectural League of New York, was Chair of the Cooper Hewitt Museum's Professional Designers Advisory Committee and a Director of The American Center for Design (1996–2000), and a Fellow of The Industrial Designers Society of America.

The Autograph Hound

The Autograph Hound is a 1939 American Donald Duck cartoon which features Donald Duck as an autograph hunter in Hollywood. Many celebrities from the 1930s are featured. This is the first cartoon where Donald Duck is featured in his blue sailor hat.
Plot.
Donald Duck tries to enter a Hollywood studio so he can search for celebrities willing to sign their autograph. A police officer guarding the gate prevents him from entering the building. Donald manages to sneak inside by climbing on the limousine with Greta Garbo so that it seems he's riding along with her. The police officer discovers he's been fooled and chases Donald, who enters a room with the name "Mickey Rooney" on it. Inside, Mickey Rooney is dressing up in front of the mirror, when Donald asks him for his autograph. Rooney writes his name in Donald's book and makes it disappear and reappear with a magic trick. Donald, who is not amused, tries to impress Rooney by doing a similar trick with an egg. The egg is however obviously hidden under Donald's hat and Rooney who is aware of this, crushes it, laughing loudly. Donald gets extremely angry and starts waving his fists, while Rooney manages to put a violin in Donald's hands and starts dancing an Irish jig Donald is playing. When Donald discovers he has been tricked for the third time he throws the violin at Rooney. Rooney ducks and the instrument lands in the face of the police officer. 
Alarmed, Donald runs away and hides under a bell-jar carried by actor Henry Armetta. When the police officer discovers Donald's hiding place the duck runs to another film set full with ice. There he meets Sonja Henie and asks her for an autograph. Henie signs her name by skating it in the ice, so that Donald has to carry it with him. While walking in a desert setting Donald discovers the ice has melted. He notices a tent with the silhouettes of three belly dancing Arabic women, who turn out to be the Ritz Brothers. Excited, he asks them for their autographs, but behaving like screwballs they jump on Donald and sign their group name on his buttocks. An enraged Donald throws a paint can at their heads, but it hits the face of the police officer instead. 
Again Donald has to flee and he runs to a castle with the sign The Road To Mandalay, which turns out to be just a model. After bumping his head into it and realizing his mistake he runs into another direction. On a pair of stairs he bumps into Shirley Temple. She, too, recognizes him and asks for an autograph. They both sit down to sign each other their autographs and Donald, excited he has his first real autograph, jumps in the air with joy. Then suddenly the police officer grabs him. Shirley tells the police officer to leave him alone and he drops Donald on the floor in surprise. "Donald Duck? Did you say "Donald Duck?". Other Hollywood actors hear his comment and enthusiastically rush to Donald to ask him to sign his autograph for them. (In chronological order: Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, The Andrews Sisters, Charlie McCarthy, Stepin Fetchit, Roland Young, the Lone Ranger riding his horse Silver, Joe E. Brown, Martha Raye, Hugh Herbert, Irvin S. Cobb, Edward Arnold, Katharine Hepburn, Eddie Cantor, Slim Summerville, Lionel Barrymore, Bette Davis, Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Mischa Auer, Joan Crawford and Charles Boyer). When the police officer asks Donald to sign his autograph book and offers him his pen, Donald squirts ink in the policeman's face. While the ink drips from the officer's face and writes Donald's name on his chest, Donald laughs hysterically.

Through 1987, the College World Series was a pure double-elimination event. The format was changed in 1988, when the tournament was divided into two four-team double-elimination brackets, with the survivors of each bracket playing in a single championship game. The single-game championship was designed for network television, with the final game on CBS on Saturday afternoon.
In 2003, the tournament returned entirely to cable television on ESPN, which had been covering all of the other games of the CWS since 1982 (and a partial schedule since 1980). The championship final became a best-of-three series between the two bracket winners, with games scheduled for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evenings.

Sponsor (legislative)

A sponsor, in the United States Congress, is a senator or representative who introduces a bill or amendment and is its chief advocate. Committees are occasionally identified as sponsors of legislation as well. A sponsor is also sometimes called a "primary sponsor."
It should not be assumed that a bill's sponsor actually drafted it. The bill may have been drafted by a staff member, by an interest group, or by others. In the Senate, multiple sponsorship of a bill is permitted.
In contrast to a sponsor, a "cosponsor" is a senator or representative who adds his or her name as a supporter to the sponsor's bill. An "initial cosponsor" or "original cosponsor" is a senator or representative who was listed as a cosponsor at the time of a bill's introduction, rather than added as a cosponsor later on. A cosponsor added later is known as an "additional cosponsor". Some bills have hundreds of cosponsors.

Wilmington Centre Village Historic District

The Wilmington Centre Village Historic District encompasses the historic center of the town of Wilmington, Massachusetts. It stretches along Church and Middlesex Streets, from the town common in the southwest to the Old Burial Ground in the northeast. The area was established as a local civic center in the 1730s with the construction of a meeting house and the cemetery. The village center experienced some growth in the early decades of the 19th century due to the presence of a factory-style bakery, but it suffered from a lack of railroad connections in later years. The town common, which anchors the southern end of the district, was laid out in the 1890s.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

A News (TV series)

A News (originally known as A-Channel News) is the name of local newscasts on the A television system in Canada. "A News" programming was produced in markets which were not directly served by a local CTV News service.
The cable-only A Atlantic service in Atlantic Canada did not produce its own "A News" programming, but instead presently airs CTV News programming from CTV Atlantic, although the station did produce a local morning show, "Breakfast Television" and was subsequently re-branded to CTV Morning Live on August 29, 2011. Due to the effects of the 2009 economic crisis The A station in Ottawa cancelled all "A News" programming in March 2009, but continued to produce a local morning show, "A Morning" which was also re-branded as "CTV Morning Live" on August 29, 2011.
When A re-launched as "CTV Two", on August 29, 2011, newscasts on the A stations were re-branded as CTV News and longer have separate identities, although the stations have retained the same editorial independence.
Atlantic.
As a holdover from the ASN era, A Atlantic simulcasted news programs from CTV Atlantic, and it was the only A station that does not air any "A News"-branded programs. It also aired a local version of "Breakfast Television", a holdover from when it was owned by CHUM Limited.
Barrie.
"A News" on CKVR-TV in Barrie was anchored by Tony Grace and Jayne Pritchard weekdays at 6 p.m., by Jayne Pritchard weekdays at 11 p.m., and anchored by Chris Lesage on weekends at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.
"A News This Week", a newscast that generally focused on the week's top local news stories formerly aired Saturday nights at 11 p.m. "Ontario News This Week", a newscast that generally focused on the week's top provincial-related as well as national and international news stories also formerly aired Sunday nights at 11 p.m.
Due to the 2009 economic crisis, both Barrie's "A News This Week" and "Ontario News This Week" were cancelled along with the "A Morning" shows produced in Barrie, London and Vancouver Island in early March 2009.
Ottawa.
"A News" on CHRO-TV in Ottawa was anchored by Sandra Blaikie weekdays at 6, Tony Grace weeknights at 11 and Annette Goerner on weekends. A spinoff version of "A News" called "A News This Week" aired Sunday nights at 6:30 p.m. and recapped the week's news.
These newscasts were cancelled on March 3, 2009, as a result of what CTV called severe financial issues with the A stations, although the Ottawa station continues to broadcast "A Morning". CHRO was the only A station (unlike the A station in Wingham which was scheduled to shut down entirely) to have its evening newscasts cancelled; the stations in Barrie, London and Victoria kept their evening newscasts but instead lost their morning shows. Due to a fire destroying CJOH's studio and newsroom, production of CJOH's newscasts was moved to CHRO's studio in February 2010.
London/Windsor.
"A News" on CFPL-TV in London was anchored by Dan MacLellan weekdays at 6, and Tara Overholt at 11. There was a weekend half-hour edition of the program, anchored by Sean Irvine. CHWI-TV in Windsor had a separate weekday newscast anchored by Jim Crichton, but simulcasts the London edition on weekends. A spinoff version of "A News" called "A News This Week" aired Sunday nights at 6:30 p.m. and recapped the week's top stories.
When CKNX-TV in Wingham served as a semi-satellite of CFPL, it simulcasted all of CFPL's newscasts, except for the 11 p.m. weeknight newscast, an alternate newscast focusing on the Wingham area produced at CFPL. Due to financial issues, CKNX was switched to a full-time translator of CFPL on August 31, 2009, and no longer airs a separate newscast.
Vancouver Island.
"A News" on CIVI-TV in Vancouver Island was anchored by Hudson Mack at 5 and 6 p.m., and Cheryl Bloxham at 11 p.m. A spinoff version of "A News" airs at 6:30pm weeknights, called "Vancouver Island Report", a newscast generally focused on news on Vancouver Island.
A weekend half-hour edition of "A News at Six", anchored by Andrew Johnson was added to the schedule in March 2009, following the layoffs. A spinoff version of "A News" also aired Saturday evenings at 7:30pm and Sunday mornings at 8:30am called "Island Weekend", a half-hour recap on the news and events happening around Vancouver Island during the week.

Voice of Indonesia

RRI World Service, Voice of Indonesia. 
The Voice of Indonesia (VOI) is an autonomous division under Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI). The organization is a public broadcasting service. It is a national radio station that broadcasts all over Indonesia and abroad to serve all Indonesia citizens anywhere in the country and abroad. RRI also provides information about Indonesia to people around the world. Voice of Indonesia is the division for abroad broadcasting. As an autonomous division, VOI has its own independent structure so it can find their own financial resources through marketing.
History.
When Indonesia declared its independence on 17 August 1945, the new country needed an effective tool to announce its declaration of independence to the whole nation and to the world audience. At 19:00 on the same day, M. Jusuf Ronodipuro, founder of the RRI, has read the proclamation of news on Hoso Kyoku, Japanese occupation Radio. He was also supported by Dr. Abdulrahman Saleh, who had a passion for radio broadcasting. Both of them then launched the "Voice of Free Indonesia" on August 22, 1945. The first Indonesian President Sukarno delivered a speech on this radio on August 25 and Vice President Mohammad Hatta, did the same on August 29. At that time, radio broadcasting was the most powerful media in order to deliver the message to reach the audiences around the world. To carry out this mission, the new Republic of Indonesia took over the former Dutch Colonial Government Radio station in Yogyakarta. 
The Indonesian broadcasting across the world was named "Voice of Free Indonesia" On 11 September 1945, the radio station became Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI), the head organization of "Voice of Indonesia". During the Indonesian National Revolution, a Scottish American woman named K'tut Tantri, who was sympathetic to the Indonesian republicans, made several English language-broadcasts on the Voice of Free Indonesia. Her broadcasts were targeted at Western listeners and she gained the nickname "Surabaya Sue" due to her support for the Indonesian nationalists. During the early days of Indonesian independence, radio broadcasting played an important role in sending the new nation's message to overseas audiences, which helped other nations recognize the sovereignty of Indonesia. In addition, the "Voice of Free Indonesia" was also the name of an Indonesian Republican magazine that was marketed at Western correspondents. In 1950, "Voice of Free Indonesia" was renamed the "Voice of Indonesia".
Operations.
The target audience of VOI was recently mentioned as ‘general audience’. Generally, there are three types of audience: Indonesian citizen abroad, Indonesian Diaspora and all the people across the globe.
Before, VOI serves people abroad in 11-different languages. It has several programs that broadcast in English, French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Thai and Indonesian.
As of 2010 VOI serves in 8 languages; Bahasa Indonesia http://id.voi.co.id, English http://en.voi.co.id, Arabic http://ar.voi.co.id, Mandarin http://cn.voi.co.id, Japanese http://jp.voi.co.id, German http://de.voi.co.id, French http://fr.voi.co.id and Spanish http://es.voi.co.id.
Until 2010, each language broadcasts 2 hours of programming a day with total of 13 hours for the whole language broadcasting. There are four main programs of VOI: News and Information, Rhythm of Archipelago; program about Indonesian music, Getting to know Indonesia; program about unique and typical culture of the country, and the Archipelago Sketches; program about regional autonomy policy that implements throughout the country. These programs are first produced in Indonesian language and then translated into 11 different languages. The content of all foreign language programs are practically the same.
Since 2010, VOI broadcasts 24 hours on internet and 12 hours on SW with only 9525 kHz. The 11785 and 15150 are idle for the time being. In history, VOI broadcasts abroad using short wave frequencies 9525, 11785 and 15150 kHz, which it has used since it first went on the air.
Although shortwave broadcasting is the main core to deliver its product, VOI also operates a web site at [http://www.voi.co.id]. Within the web site, audience may find written news in 11 different languages, as well as live streaming radio service which is started on 1 April 2008. However, the streaming service is not as fully functioned as the shortwave broadcasting.
But since 2010 audio and video streaming is fully functioned as additional medium of broadcast. VOI uses social media such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter to update information about Indonesia. 
And just recently to provide the service to mobile user Voice of Indonesia has launched RRI World Service Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev263272.app246169 and RRI Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdhugoltech.rrimobile on Google Play store.

Taken Out

Taken Out is an Australian television dating game show that was originally broadcast on Network Ten between 1 September 2008 and 26 February 2009. The format was developed by FremantleMedia and was hosted by James Kerley, a Foxtel television presenter who has also hosted shows such as "Cash Cab" and "The Dave & Kerley Show".
British, Irish and Philippine versions of the show have been developed under the name "Take Me Out". Versions have also been made in Denmark, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Spain, China, United States, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and Canada (Quebec).
Format.
"Taken Out" is primarily a studio-based show, with limited amounts of location-based material, that involves a single person who is introduced to thirty single people of the opposite sex which were revealed to them in the "Taken Out" arena. The show is split into two sections: The initial selection in the studio, and the two stage date. During the course of the game, the host presents information and videos about the single person and based upon this information, the thirty people periodically decide independently, if they should 'leave their light on' and stay in the game with the chance to date the single person or to 'turn their light out' and exclude themselves from the chance to date the person.
Initial selection.
Firstly, the women learnt a single piece of information about the single man which, along with his appearance, they used to decide whether they were interested or not. The women then judged and turned their lights off or on depending on their decision, however once they had turned their lights off, they couldn't change their minds. Then there would be a video of the single man shown, where they would describe their best features and qualities to try and keep as many women in the game as possible. The women then judged again. Next, a video by the single man's friend, family member, co worker or ex partner was shown. The women then decided again. Finally, if there were four or more women left with their lights on, the single man walked around the arena and personally met each remaining woman and either turn her light out or left hers on until there were only three women remaining. Then the single man asked a question to the three women, in which he then chose one woman to dismiss. This occurred again for the remaining two women. At the end the single man formally got asked if they would like to date the remaining woman or not. The first question was skipped if only two women are remaining and the single man still got to ask a question if only one woman was remaining before arriving at the question stage. If at any stage of the game all thirty women had turned their lights off, the game ended immediately and the single man left the show without a woman. During the whole process Kerley waked around the arena and chatted with different women asking for their opinions of the single man and why they had kept their light on or turned it off.
Dating process.
After the initial selection is complete, a three stage dating process occurs. Firstly, the couple get to chat in private in a 'green room' at the studios in which they can get to know each other better in an uninfluenced environment. Next up, the couple meet for a date at a Melbourne restaurant, bar, massage parlour or other similar place. If either person is still interested in the other, there is an opportunity to attend a rendezvous at the Eureka Tower observation deck, where champagne and views of Melbourne at night await. This can often embarrassingly lead to only one person attending the rendezvous point. The latter two meetings are optional, however most attend the second stage. After all possible meetings, a final verdict is delivered. If either person wants the relationship to continue, they 'leave their light on' but if they wish for the relationship to end, they 'turn their light out'. This process is shown on the episode after the episode where their pairing was determined in the studio.
Broadcast.
The show originally screened Monday to Friday in the 7pm timeslot before it was moved to an earlier 6pm timeslot after two weeks on air, due to competition from other shows. It was removed from schedules in its fourth week after screening 19 episodes, due to continuing mediocre ratings. Despite the axing, FremantleMedia continued to produce new episodes. In total, 65 episodes had been recorded. On 12 January 2009, "Taken Out" returned to air at around midnight each morning, seven days a week. The remaining 46 episodes aired until 26 February 2009.
The show has also aired on Australian subscription television channel Channel V.

The Adams-Magoun House, built ca. 1783, is a good example of Federal period architecture at 438 Broadway in near Magoun Square in Somerville, Massachusetts. Although built during the Federal period, and showing that influence, the floor plan is traditional four-room Georgian. It is a five-bay, gable roof house and has what is reportedly one of the earliest five-part leaded fanlights in the Boston area.
It was built by Joseph Adams in 1783. Adams was married to Sarah Tufts, whose extended family owned large tracts of land in the town, including the tracts which eventually became Tufts University. She was the daughter of Peter and Anne Tufts.
Their daughter, Sarah Ann Adams, married John C. Magoun (1797 - 1882), for whom Magoun Square is named. Magoun was the local Assessor for twenty-eight years and was Captain in the militia at the time of the visit by the Marquis de Lafayette in 1826. At the time of Adams' marriage to Magoun, the Adams farm extended from Broadway to the Boston and Maine Railroad, between Central and Lowell streets.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

The All-Night Show

The All-Night Show was a television series starring Chas Lawther and produced by Jeff Silverman which ran from September 1980 to August 1981 on CFMT-TV in Toronto. 
The show ran live nightly from the end of other programming (typically 2 am) until 6 am. The premise was that Lawther's character, Chuck the Security Guard, had, with the help of his never-seen technically minded friend Ryerson Dupont (played by writer Errol Bruce and named after Toronto's Ryerson Polytechnical Institute) and P.B. Leonard, took over the facilities of CFMT and accidentally broadcast their favorite shows over the air while fooling around with the equipment. "The All-Night Show" generally showed reruns of classic series such as "The Twilight Zone", "The Outer Limits", and "The Prisoner", and filled the space in between with music videos (including old Scopitones), old movie shorts, and comedic banter. The show only lasted one year, ending when CFMT cut its budget for the time slot.
Jim Carrey was featured in some episodes of "The All-Night Show", primarily as a voice actor.

USS San Diego (AFS-6)

USS "San Diego" (AFS-6) was a "Mars"-class combat stores ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1968. She served the U.S. Atlantic Fleet until decommissioned in 1993. She then was redesignated as a United States Naval Ship, assigned to the Military Sealift Command, and served in a non-commissioned status with a mostly civilian crew as USNS "San Diego" (T-AFS-6) until 1997.
Built in California.
The third ship to be so named, "San Diego" was laid down on 11 March 1967 by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company at San Diego, California; launched on 13 April 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Frank Curran; and commissioned on 24 May 1969, Captain John W. Wells in command.
Operational history.
After shakedown and refresher training in late 1969, "San Diego" began a seven-month, deployment to the Mediterranean in support of the United States Sixth Fleet. She returned to her home port, Norfolk, Virginia, and remained on the United States East Coast until February 1971, when she was selected to represent the United States Atlantic Fleet at the Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans, Louisiana.
In April 1971, she deployed again to the Sixth Fleet and stayed in the Mediterranean until October 1971. During this tour of duty, she earned the Supply Efficiency "E," rescued sailors from a burning Greek freighter, and represented the Sixth Fleet at Admiral Farragut Day at Minorca in Spains Balearic Islands.
On 27 July 1972, following more than nine months back in the United States operating and training along U.S. East Coast, "San Diego" got underway to return to the Sixth Fleet. She arrived at Rota, Spain, on 4 August 1972 and relieved USS "Sylvania" (AFS-2) as the on-station combat stores ship with the Sixth Fleet. At the end of another six months of service in the Mediterranean, "San Diego" got underway to return to Norfolk in January 1973. She arrived on 26 January and resumed normal operations with the Atlantic Fleet.
"San Diego" operated out of Norfolk, along the U.S. East Coast, and in the Caribbean until late October 1973. At that time, she departed Norfolk for her fourth tour of duty in the Mediterranean. She arrived at Rota, Spain, on 4 November 1973. She cruised the Mediterranean with the Sixth Fleet for the next six months, getting underway from Rota on 19 April 1974 to return to Norfolk. "San Diego" reached Norfolk on 27 April 1974.
Between June 1974 and June 1976 "San Diego" made two more deployments to the Sixth Fleet and an additional excursion to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training.
During the three Mediterranean cruises from 1973 to 1976, USS "San Diego" stopped in ports from Lisbon, Portugal, to the Greek Island of Corfu, just off the coast of Albania. The eastern most port "San Diego" visited was Athens, and the only North African port she called at was Tunis, Tunisia. Palma de Mallorca and Naples, Italy were the ports she most frequented during those years.
On 17 January 1989, "San Diego" was involved in a collision with the submarine USS "Norfolk" (SSN-714) off Cape Charles Light, Virginia, as both vessels were headed to sea. While trying to pass "San Diego" in a turn in the channel, "Norfolk" was set toward an outer buoy on the port side by the current. Over correcting for this, "Norfolk" delivered a glancing blow to "San Diego" on her starboard side. There were no injuries however both vessels received minor damage and San Diego was forced into drydock for repairs following the incident.
Transfer to Military Sealift Command.
On 11 August 1993 "San Diego" was decommissioned, transferred to the U.S. Navys Military Sealift Command, and placed in non-commissioned service as a United States Naval Ship with a mostly civilian crew as USNS "San Diego" (T-AFS-6).
"San Diego" continued in service until 10 December 1997 when she was laid up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Disposal.
"San Diego" was stricken from the Navy List on 10 December 1997 and she was sold for scrapping at Philadelphia on 9 April 2006.

Order of the Star and Eagles of Ghana

The Order of the Star and Eagles of Ghana is an order created by President John Kufuor of Ghana in June 2008. The award superseded the Order of the Star of Ghana as the highest national decoration. It is to be presented only to those who have obtained the office of President of the Republic of Ghana.
There was significant criticism to the order's creation. Some suggested it was inappropriate for such an order with such limited members to be the highest in the land. Others have suggested this is simple a vanity title for the outgoing president and comparisons have been made to African dictators who gave themselves titles (such as Idi Amin).
Others have suggested that the order is illegal as it was instituted by executive ordinance rather than being a parliamentary motion. It is questionable as to whether or not the President is legally allowed to create such an order Although the President is "fount of honour" (in that all honours flow from the president, similar to the British model where all honours flow from the Queen) it is debatable as to whether or not the President has the authority to simply create a new order.

<doc id="18765601" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18765601" title="Bum steer">
Bum steer

To give a bum steer is a predominantly Australian and New Zealand idiom which is evident from the 19th century use and means to provide information that is not correct, was not found helpful, or caused one to be led astray. It does not imply either intentional or unintentional provision of information, and is not generally regarded as pejorative.
The "steer" in the idiom is not originally related to the bovines. Its origin is suggested to be derived from the American maritime humour of trying to steer a vessel in reverse where its stern construction, in the 19th century, lacked the streamlines of the bow, and is therefore prone to miscalculated manoeuvring when using the rudder. The manoeuvring was accomplished through shouted instructions on the wharf to the wheelhouse where the steering was performed, via intermediary deckhands, and was therefore prone to misunderstanding owing to the wide variety of nationalities employed on United States merchant vessels during the 19th century.
The idiom, as used in Australia and New Zealand, reached the United States in the 1920s probably after exposure to Australian troops on the Western Front, and is recorded in the UK since 1944.
In the United States the expression refers to a poorly conditioned young bullock.

Iliaș Colceag

Iliaş Colceag (fl. before 1710 – 1743) was a Moldavian mercenary and military commander, in the Ottoman and Russian Empire.
He entered the Ottoman army and was first posted in Bosnia. Here, he converted to Islam and took the name of "Hussein". He distinguished himself during the Russo-Turkish War of 1710/11 being promoted bölükbaşı. In 1717 Sultan Ahmed III awarded him the title of pasha and named him commander of the Khotyn Fortress. Colceag kept this position for 22 years. In the Turkish historiography he is also known as Kolchak-Pasha. In 1734 (according to other sources 1736) he was appointed vizier, but held this position only for a short time. 
During the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739, Colceag was appointed commander in chief of the Ottoman armed forces of the Moldavian front. He did not see any major action, as the main battles were fought mainly on the Crimean peninsula. However, in 1738, when the main hostilities moved to the Southern Bug, the command of the Ottoman army was taken over by Veli-Paşa while Colceag kept his position of commander of the Khotyn Fortress.
After defeating the Turks in the Battle of Stavuchany, Russian General von Münnich besieged the Khotyn Fortress. Colceag had only 900 men to face the over 60.000 strong Russian army. General von Münnich offered Colceag honorable conditions of surrender following which, on 19 August 1739 the pasha capitulated.
Colceag and his son Mahmet-bey were taken to Saint Petersburg and stayed there as prisoners of war. They were freed by the Empress Anna on 15 February 1740. After the peace treaty was signed, Colceag decided to return to Constantinople. On his way he was informed that Sultan Mahmud I had decided to decapitate him, considering the surrender of Khotyn an act of treason. 
Colceag entered into service with the Kiev voivode, the Polish count Józef Potocki. He settled in Żytomierz where he died in 1743.
His son entered into Russian service and converted to Orthodox Christianity. Under Empress Elizabeth of Russia the Kolchak family achieved aristocratic status and became landowners. Most of Colceag’s descendants followed military careers. The most famous of Colceag’s descendants is Admiral Alexander Kolchak

John Bingham, 7th Baron Clanmorris

John Michael Ward Bingham, 7th Baron Clanmorris (3 November 1908 – 6 August 1988) was a former MI5 spy and an English novelist who published 17 thrillers, detective novels and spy novels.
Background.
During the Second World War, and for two decades after 1950, Bingham worked for MI5, and was reportedly the inspiration for John LeCarre's character George Smiley., John LeCarre denied this identification in a BBC Radio "Front Row" interview in 2009, saying Bingham's successful thriller novels, published when the two men worked together at MI5 in the 1950s, inspired LeCarre to write his first two books. In 1999, le Carré confirmed that Bingham was also an inspiration for Smiley, and in 2000 went further, writing in an introduction to a reissue of one of Bingham's novels that "He had been one of two men who had gone into the making of George Smiley. Nobody who knew John and the work he was doing could have missed the description of Smiley in my first novel".
However, newly released documents in the UK National Archives have now shown that Bingham (a "genius spy") not only worked for MI5 but during World War 2, ran a hugely dangerous and very successful deception. From 1942, using the pseudonym "Jack King", he had direct contact with six men and women who believed he was working for the Gestapo and they gave him information on "scores and probably hundreds" of Nazi sympathisers in the UK. The plan had been to penetrate Siemens Schuckert (GB) Ltd, the British arm of the German industrial company that was believed to be involved in espionage, until Bingham met a "crafty and dangerous woman" called Marita Perigoe. Of mixed Swedish and German origin, she was married to a member of Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, but saw them as "insufficiently extreme". MI5 reported that "She was found to be so violently anti-British and so anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt that special attention should be paid to her." One Nazi sympathiser, Hilda Leech, passed on reports about secret research to develop a jet aircraft. An astrologer, Edgar Whitehead, gave details about secret trials on a new amphibious tank. The sympathisers’ hatred for Britain, driven by anti-Semitism and the propaganda of Mosley’s group, was so strong that they "applauded" women and children being killed by German bombs, Bingham's reports show. 
Although Bingham is named as the agent running the double cross in the diary of Guy Liddell, then MI5’s head of counter-intelligence, Prof Christopher Andrew, the former official historian of the Security Service is quoted as saying that he could not comment on "Jack King’s" true identity, as it will never be officially revealed.
Bingham was recruited into MI5 by Maxwell Knight to work in the counter-intelligence and political infiltration based M Section. He had volunteered to serve in the army but a sight defect prevented him from serving in the field. Prior to his service in MI5, Bingham had been the Art Editor of the "Sunday Dispatch".
Bingham was the son of Arthur Bingham, 6th Baron Clanmorris and Mowbray Leila Cloete. He was educated at Cheltenham College, and married Madeleine Mary Ebel, daughter of Clement Ebel, on 28 July 1934. He fought in the Second World War, with the Royal Engineers and attached to the General Staff. He succeeded to the title of 7th Baron Clanmorris on 24 June 1960.
Bingham's first novel, "My Name is Michael Sibley" (1952), was unusual for its time in suggesting that the British police might not always play fair.

<doc id="18765675" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18765675" title="Harry Forrester (coach)">
Harry Forrester (coach)

Harry Conway Forrester (August 19, 1922 – July 16, 2008) was a visionary American basketball and baseball coach who led the way in integrating the sports teams of Quincy University in the racially segregated 1950s. He was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame and the Quincy University Hall of Fame for his contributions to sport. During the 1956–57 season, he was honored as Catholic College Coach of the Year.
Harry Forrester was born in Raymond, Illinois. He received the American Pacific Theater of War Ribbon and the American Theater of War Ribbon for his naval service during the Second World War. In 1949, he received his Bachelor's Degree from Millikin University, and in 1959 he received his Master's Degree from Eastern Illinois University.
He began his coaching career in 1949–54 in Effingham, Illinois, as St. Anthony High School's first full-time basketball coach, leading the team to "unprecedented success" while compiling a 21–7 record in his first year and an overall five-year record of 95–43. His team won the school's first National Trail Conference Championship in 1952–53.
He was head basketball and baseball coach and athletic director at Quincy College (now Quincy University) from 1954 to 1957. During his first year at Quincy, his basketball team earned a berth in the quarterfinals of the NAIA national tournament (now the NCAA tournament) in Kansas City, which was Quincy College's first athletic team to qualify for a national competition. That team's 17–9 season set the best record in the school's history at the time.
Forrester did something other colleges refused to do during the segregation era - play black players. To African-American guard Dick Thompson, Coach Harry Forrester was a visionary:
"He had the courage to look a little ahead of the curve," Thompson said of his Quincy College basketball coach. "He played guys who had the ability to get the job done. It didn't matter the color of your skin. That's a tribute to him as a person, that he looked far beyond the situation and had the courage to do what he did in playing guys of color."
African-American forward Edsel Bester said that Coach Forrester pre-dated the principles of Martin Luther King by refusing to judge a person by the color of his skin. "He judged each one of us by the content of our character. He let us know we were not only representing ourselves but our parents, our coach and our school, and he didn't want you to forget that. I loved Coach Harry Forrester and I thank God every day in my life that I knew him."
In his ground-breaking work on behalf of racial equality in sport, Harry Forrester was a decade ahead of the integrated basketball teams at Loyola University Chicago and Texas Western, which gained greater fame in the 1960s.
In an article on 29 September 2012, Stever Eighinger of the Quincy "Herald-Whig" noted that "Harry Forrester did not spend much time in Quincy, but it's safe to say his impact will be remembered forever," recalling that his decision, as Quincy College's head basketball coach, to play five black basketball players "came at the height of racial insensitivity in the mid-to-late 1950s and was a full decade before Texas Western (now UTEP) started five black players in what is now the NCAA Division I national championship game. A movie was made about that Texas Western team, but outside of Quincy, only a handful of people to this day realize history was first made Forrester in West-Central Illinois." Eighinger observed that Forrester "eventually earned as much respect for his decision to play five black players as he did for leading the Hawks to their first national tournament appearance." 
A second article by Eighinger in the "Quincy Herald-Whig" on 3 October 2012, reflected on the death of Ed Crenshaw, the Quincy basketball team's captain and leading scorer in the 1950s: "'Easy Ed' was one of the nicest men I ever met, and if you are a longtime Quincy University basketball fan that name probably rings a bell. And if you have never heard of Easy Ed, Dick Thompson, Edsel Bester, Ben Bumbry and Bill Lemon, well ... you should have. 
"Those five men, and their coach, the late Harry Forrester, made history in the mid-1950s with the Hawks basketball program. The problem, at the time, was no one realized it. 
"A decade later, it was a big deal when Texas Western, which is now known as UTEP, started five black players in the NCAA Tournament championship game against Kentucky. A few years ago, they even made a movie about their coach, Don Haskins, and those players. Harry Forrester and the players from Quincy never received that kind of (positive) attention. 
"The 1950s and 1960s were a much different time in America when it came to racism and sports, especially at the amateur level. This was a time when the Mississippi State basketball team declined an invitation to take part in the NCAA Tournament because it might have to play against an opponent with black players. At that time, many black players preferred to attend 'historically black colleges' rather than be subjected to the treatment those from Quincy received. 
Easy Ed, Dick Thompson, Edsel Bester, Ben Bumbry and Bill Lemon were subjected to racial taunts and threats when they played on the road. Somehow, Forrester and those players led Quincy College to its first appearance in a national tournament - the NAIA event in Kansas City, Mo. - during the coach's 1954-57 stay here.
"After winning its opening-round game in the 32-school tournament, Quincy lost its next start by four points to a team considered far inferior -- but white. Quincy's black players were constantly in foul trouble and the Hawks got few, if any, breaks when it came to officials' calls. 
To this day, if you ask any of those Quincy players, they will tell you they did not lose the second game of that national tournament. The other team simply wound up with more points on the scoreboard. 
"'It was a tough time, because of all the black players on the team,' Easy Ed told me back in 2005. 'Sometimes it seems like it was just yesterday.'
"The following is an excerpt from [Eighinger's] 2005 "Quincy Herald-Whig" article 'Only The Net Was White':
Memoir.
Harry Forrester's life has been chronicled in the 2011 memoir, "Blaw, Hunter, Blaw Thy Horn", published by Mayhaven Publishing: ISBN 13:9781932278682; ISBN 1-932278-68-0.

She has taught in the Edna Manley College of Visual and Performing Arts, the Sam Fox College of Design & Visual at Washington University in St. Louis. She has taught at the University of Virginia and is currently an Assistant Professor in Painting at the University of Kentucky She has shown her artwork in numerous solo and private exhibitions, such as "Infinite Island: Contemporary Caribbean Art, Brooklyn Museum, (2007)." " National Biennial, National Gallery of Jamaica,(2006,2008,2010)","Ghetto Biennale , Port-au-Prince, Haiti","Rockstone and Bootheel, Real Artways, (2010)" "Wrestling With the Image, Museum of the Americas,(2011)"
Work.
Patterson’s work revolves around questions of identity and the body, and takes the form of mixed media paintings, drawings and collages, most of them on paper. Photography, found objects, installation and performance have recently become increasingly important in her practice. Early work was primarily concerned with the female body as object. Her Venus Investigations objectified the female torso, headless and anonymous, and explored the relationship between the ample-bodied "Venus" or female goddess images of prehistoric times and contemporary female self-images and beauty ideals. Subsequent works more provocatively focused on the vagina as an object and, by implication, examined the taboos that surround this body part and its functions within Jamaican culture. This also led to 3-dimensional constructions made from intimate female articles such as sanitary napkins and tampons and more abstracted and surreal hybrid organic forms that appeared in her large paper collages of 2007. This early body of work has a sober and at times even majestic visual beauty which as she puts it, reference "beauty through the use of the grotesque but visceral, confrontational and deconstructed."
Gangstas for Life.
One of Patterson's most recognized body of work, is a series entitled "Gangstas for Life," which explores conceptions of masculinity within Dancehall culture. In this series, the artist specifically explores skin bleaching as a means of marking and transformation, not as an act of racial self-loathing. Additionally the series "seeks to examine the dichotomy between Jamaican stereotypical ideologies of homosexual practices and its parallels within dancehall culture." Red floral and fish motifs throughout the series serve to represent homosexuality within a predominantly homophobic culture. Pattersons images imaginatively recreate portraits of young black males who bleach their skin, pluck their eyebrows and wear 'bling' jewellery to enhance their gangsta status. Patterson finds beauty in their psychic violence glamorizing them with glittered halos and luscious lipstick. The artist explores perceptions of beauty as grotesque within the series, and her portrayal of the subjects' cracked, bleeding and oozing skins.

Willem de Waal

Willem de Waal (born 17 February 1978 in Paarl, South Africa) is a South African rugby union footballer who is currently playing for Benetton Treviso in the RaboDirect Pro12 competition. He plays in the position of fly-half. Like Joost van der Westhuizen at scrum-half, de Waal is unusually big for a fly-half.
Career.
De Waal played rugby for Stellenbosch University before making his provincial debut with the Leopards in 2002. He then moved to the Free State Cheetahs in 2004 where he would experience his greatest success so far. In each of his four seasons at the club, the Cheetahs made it to the final of the Currie Cup, winning twice and sharing one.
De Waal has also played at Super Rugby level, making his debut with the Bulls in 2004 before joining the Cats in 2005. When the competition expanded to 14 teams in 2006, the Cats split into two separate franchises – the Lions and the Cheetahs, which de Waal joined.
On 24 July 2007, it was announced that de Waal signed a two-year deal with French Second Division club RC Narbonne. He returned to South Africa after one season and secured a spot in the 2009 Stormers squad, his fourth different super rugby team. He also played in the Currie Cup for Western Province that same season.

Metallophyte

A metallophyte is a plant that can tolerate high levels of heavy metals such as lead. Such plants range between "obligate metallophytes" (which can only survive in the presence of these metals), and "facultative metallophytes" which can tolerate such conditions but are not confined to them.
European examples include Alpine Pennycress, the Zinc Violet ("Viola calaminaria"), Spring Sandwort ("Minuartia verna"), Sea Thrift, Cochlearia, Common Bent ("Agrostis capillaris") and Plantain ("Plantago lanceolata").
Metallophytes commonly exist as specialised flora found on spoil heaps of mines.
Such plants have potential for use for phytoremediation of contaminated ground.

Wealth and religion

There has been some research on the correlation of wealth and religion. Wealth is the status of being the beneficiary or proprietor of a large accumulation of capital and economic power. Religion is a cultural system that often involves belief in supernatural forces and may intend to provide a moral system or a meaning of life.
A study in the United States, published in the Social Forces journal and conducted by Sociology researcher Lisa A. Keister, found that adherents of Judaism and Episcopalianism attained the most wealth, believers of Catholicism and mainline Protestants were in the middle, while conservative Protestants accumulated the least wealth, while in general people who attend religious services achieved more wealth than those who do not (taking into account variations of education and other factors). The researcher suggests that wealth accumulation is shaped by family processes.
The median net worth of people believing in Judaism is calculated at 150,890 USD, while the median net worth of conservative Protestants (including Baptists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Christian Scientists) was found at 26,200 USD. The overall median in the dataset was 48,200 USD.
Another study, published in the American Journal of Sociology (AJS) by Lisa Keister, found that "religion affects wealth indirectly through educational attainment, fertility, and female labor force participation" but also found some evidence of direct effects of religion on wealth attainment.
Wealth and atheism.
Some studies have found correlations between wealth and lack of religious beliefs. The GDP of countries generally correlates negatively with their religiosity, i.e. the less religious a population is the wealthier it is.

Ptarmigan Tunnel

The Ptarmigan Tunnel was built in 1930 through the Ptarmigan Wall at an elevation of in Glacier National Park, near Many Glacier. The tunnel allows hikers to avoid a strenuous climb over very steep terrain between Many Glacier and the Belly River valley. Two opposing steel jackhammers drilling from either side of the tunnel and a series of ten-hole rounds of dynamite gradually broke through the mountain in less than three months. A wide area, originally for guide and tourist horses, extends from each portal with a masonry retaining wall. Natural rock lines the interior walls. Heavy iron doors were hung across the tunnel adits during the summer of 1975. They remain open from mid-July until October 1, weather permitting. The long tunnel is a unique man-made feature in Glacier. This trail tunnel embodies exceptional qualities of landscape architecture and engineering in a pedestrian-scaled tunnel, cut through a sheer mountain wall. The portals frame spectacular views.

Frederick Atkins

Frederick Atkins (died 2005) was a convicted murderer who received a mandatory death sentence from a court in Barbados. He died in prison while the Inter-American Court of Human Rights was considering his appeal.
Atkins was a bus driver prior to his murder trial. In 1998, Atkins was convicted of the murder of 20-year-old Sharmaine Hurley and in 2000 received a mandatory death sentence. He received an execution warrant in June 2002 but it was stayed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the supreme court of Barbados. On 3 September 2004, Atkins and three other death row inmates in Barbados appealed their sentences to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
On 9 February 2005, Barbados issued another death warrant for Atkins, informing him that he was scheduled to be executed by hanging on 14 February. After appeals to the government by Amnesty International and the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the Barbados High Court agreed to stay the execution.
Later in 2005, Atkins died in prison of an illness. In December 2007, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights ruled that Atkins's mandatory sentence and the mandatory sentence provisions of the Barbados murder statute violate the right to life guarantees of the American Convention on Human Rights.

Vancouver anti-Chinese riots, 1886

The Vancouver anti-Chinese riots of 1886, sometimes called the Winter Riots because of the time of year they took place, were prompted by the engagement of cheap Chinese labour by the Canadian Pacific Railway to clear Vancouver's West End of large Douglas fir trees and stumps, passing over the thousands of unemployed men from the rest of Canada who had arrived looking for work.
In November, 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway was finished and thus laid off thousands of who were thus stranded in Southern British Columbia—some went to the Cariboo in search of gold, some went to San Francisco, while others came to Vancouver. 
In January, 1886, Chinese workers were camped on the shore of Vancouver Harbour, near the present north end of Burrard Street. Chinese were hired to clear the trees and stumps then still standing in Vancouver's West End, at the usual much lower rate paid to Chinese labour. In January 1886, an angry mob of whites, who had been unemployed and hungry for weeks with no work and angered that potentially-available employment and payscales were undercut by Chinese labour, stormed the Chinese camp in the West End at night, then camped in their tents. Many were injured, and some fled into the icy sea to escape their assailants.

23rd Street Fire

The 23rd Street Fire was an incident that took place on October 17, 1966 in the New York City borough of Manhattan, when a group of firefighters from the New York City Fire Department responding to a fire at 7 East 22nd Street entered a building at 6 East 23rd Street as part of an effort to fight the fire. Twelve firefighters were killed after the floor collapsed, the largest loss of life in the department's history until the collapse of the World Trade Center in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
The incident.
A fire was reported at 9:36 pm at an art dealer located at 7 East 22nd Street, just off Broadway, in a four-story brownstone, transmitted as Box 598. A FDNY report after the incident showed that the dealer had stored highly flammable lacquer, paint, and finished wood frames in the basement. By the time the first firefighters arrived, the intensity of the smoke and heat made it impossible to enter through the 22nd Street side of the building.
Firefighters attempted to approach the burning building through Wonder Drug, a store located at 6 East 23rd Street in a five-story, 45x100 commercial building that abutted the burning art dealership. As part of a recent construction project, a common cellar under the two buildings was renovated, removing a load-bearing dividing wall that had supported the floor above. The removal of the wall allowed the art dealer to increase their storage space and move some of their supplies into a space that was now under the drugstore.
The building at 7 East 22nd Street had a two-story extension adjoining the rear of the building at 6 East 23rd Street. The cellar of the 22nd Street building extended about 35 feet under the drug store. The drugstore's floor was supported by 3" x 14" wood beams. 3/4" wood planking atop these beams was covered with five inches of concrete finished with terrazzo. The fire underneath the store weakened the wooden beams, while the thickness of the floor prevented firefighters from feeling the extreme heat below.
A 15 by 35 foot section of the floor collapsed at 10:39 pm, one hour and three minutes after the initial alarm was transmitted, causing ten firefighters to fall into the burning cellar. Two other firefighters on the first floor were killed in a flashover. In all, twelve firefighters were killed: two chiefs, two lieutenants, and eight firefighters. It took firefighters 14 hours to dig out the rubble and reach their dead comrades. The dead men left behind 12 widows and 32 children. The fire raged to a 5th Alarm.
Aftermath.
10,000 firefighters lined Fifth Avenue on October 21, 1966, as ten firetrucks carried ten coffins to separate services at St. Thomas Protestant Episcopal Church and at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Firefighters came from as far away as Anchorage, Alaska, and San Francisco, and included a group of 500 firefighters from Boston who had come to pay tribute.

Quadiriki Caves

The Quadiriki Caves (Guadirikiri Caves, Quadirikiri Cave) are located in Arikok National Park on the island of Aruba. There are three caves, which tourists commonly explore. Caves are located at the base of a limestone cliff. They contain Amerindian petroglyphs. The name of the caves are of Arawak origin.
The first two chambers in the largest, 150 m long cave, are illuminated by holes in the ceiling, while the third chamber is damp and dark, filled with bat guano. Cave contains stalactites and stalagmites.
A smaller 98-foot (30 m) long cave to the east from the main cave is especially rich with Amerindian petroglyphs.
A somewhat dubious folk tale relates to a daughter of an Indian chief who fell in love and was imprisoned in the cave as her paramour was not acceptable to her father. Her beloved one was imprisoned nearby, in Huliba Cave (Tunnel of Love), but both lovers managed to meet underground. Both reportedly died in the cave and their spirit vanished into heaven through the holes in the roof of the cave.

2003 Buffalo Bills season

The 2003 Buffalo Bills season was their 44th in the league. The team failed to improve upon their previous season's output of 8–8, instead finishing 6–10. The team missed the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season.
The Bills started the season strong, opening the season with a dominating 31–0 blowout of the New England Patriots (They would not win another game against the Patriots until 2011). It was their largest margin of victory in a season opener since 1992, and their first regular season shutout in four years. The Bills' second game was a convincing three-touchdown win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. But Buffalo lost seven of their next nine games, and finished the season with three consecutive losses. Ironically, the Bills' final game of the season was a 31–0 shutout loss to the New England Patriots – the reverse of the score by which the Bills beat New England in Week One.
Head coach Gregg Williams's contract was not renewed after the 2003 season.
Van Miller, the team's longtime play-by-play announcer, announced his retirement after week 2 of the season; his retirement took effect at the end of the season.
Offseason.
NFL Draft.
The Bills traded away their first pick in the 2003 draft (#14 overall) to the New England Patriots for Drew Bledsoe in the previous draft. They obtained their first pick (#23 overall) from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for Peerless Price. Though he was not drafted, Buffalo acquired running back Fred Jackson out of Coe College in 2003; Jackson went on to lead the league in all-purpose yardage in 2009.

OSC OSCar

The OSCar was a synthesizer manufactured by the Oxford Synthesiser Company from 1983 to 1985. It was ahead of its time in several ways and was one of the few mono-synths to have MIDI. Around 2000 were made.
History.
When synthesizer manufacturer Electronic Dream Plant folded in 1982, Chris Huggett went on to form the Oxford Synthesiser Company. The OSCar synthesizer was launched in 1983. Chris Huggett designed the electronics while independent product designer Anthony Harrison-Griffin was responsible for the unique look and build of the OSCar.
Design and features.
Harrison-Griffin's use of distinctive black rubberized components to protect the controls and main casing became one of the instrument's most distinctive visual features. He even built into the ends a dummy 3-pin main socket to safely store the plug.
Although the basic structure of the OSCar is the common subtractive synthesis model, it has many unusual features and design quirks. The main difference from other synthesizers of the time was its digital oscillators and control system. The oscillators have an array of standard wave shapes including triangle, sawtooth, square and a variable pulse-width modulation, but the digital system also provides additive synthesis. New waveforms can be created by changing the amplitudes of up to 24 harmonics, widening the available sound palette in comparison with purely analogue synths. The two oscillators can either be played together monophonically, or the OSCar can be set in a duophonic mode where each oscillator plays a different note. 
The filter was actually two 12dB/Oct analog filters that can be combined into either a 24dB low pass, a 24dB high pass or a 12dB bandpass filter. Although this design appeared in other analog synths of the era, such as the Roland Jupiter-6, the OSCar has its own unique twist on it, by having a "Separation" control that allowed you to separate the filters' cutoff frequencies. This created two resonance peaks in the filter, giving a unique "vocal" character.
The OSCar has an elementary sequencer. In duophonic mode it allows the user to play a monophonic lead whilst a sequence plays simultaneously. Many sequencers at the time only allowed notes of a fixed length to be used in their sequencers but on the OSCar it was possible to lengthen individual notes or insert spaces.
Users.
Although only 2000 OSCars were made they found their way into many professional hands. Ultravox used one for the solo on Love's Great Adventure, and it is used for the bass on Stevie Wonder's Skeletons, Jean-Michel Jarre's Revolutions Overture, Seaweed (British musician) of Ozric Tentacles used one in his rig and perhaps most notably on Do They Know It's Christmas.
Emulation.
The GForce impOSCar is a software emulation of the OSC OSCar.

They understand the bush, they know how to navigate in difficult terrain, they know the hidden passes and the common mistakes walkers make while trying to find a route in difficult country.
In 1936, a high-profile search for missing bushwalkers prompted the police and the Confederation of Bushwalking Clubs to form the search and rescue subcommittee of the Confederation. By 2000, changing times prompted the subcommittee to form into an incorporated entity, with more highly trained membership (requiring specialist skills to effectively work with other search agencies).

419th Night Fighter Squadron

The 419th Night Fighter Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with Thirteenth Air Force, being inactivated at Floridablanca, Luzon on 20 February 1947.
History.
Activated on 1 April 1943. Trained at Kissimmee, Florida using in the RP-322 Lightnings and P-70 Havocs due to non-availability of P-61 Black Widows. By the end of training, the night fighter pilots realized that the Black Widow would not be forthcoming and resigned themselves to the fact they would be going overseas with P-70s.
The squadron arrived at Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands on 15 November 1943, assigned to Thirteenth Air Force. The squadron absorbed Detachment B of the 6th Night Fighter Squadron. On 21 November 1943, the squadron was assigned to the 18th Fighter Group. With the mixed bag of P-38H Lightnings and P-70s prowling the skies, combat operations commenced. The P-38Hs were stock day fighters with no radar or any other equipment for finding the enemy at night. The Lightning pilots would wait until the enemy was over a target and, hopefully, illuminated by the defender's searchlights. They would then try to pick out the outline of the enemy aircraft and intercept. This method had its dangers since the P-38 was subjecting itself to antiaircraft fire from defenders as well as gunners aboard the Japanese bombers. The squadron received the P-61 Black Widow to replace the P-38s/P-70s in May 1944. Then on 25 August 1944, the squadron was re-assigned to the XIII Fighter Command.
The squadron flew numerous missions against Japanese night intruders, which were a real nuisance to American forces and which up to this time had been virtually immune from interception. On typical missions, the pilot would be directed to the vicinity of its target by ground based radar. The onboard A/I radar under the control of the radar operator would then be used to direct the pilot to close with and intercept the enemy. As soon as the pilot had gotten close enough to its target to make a visual identification, the guns would be aimed and fired by the pilot or by the gunner. The appearance of the Black Widow in the night skies over the Pacific was a rude and unpleasant surprise for these night raiders. Engaged the enemy during the New Guinea, Northern Solomon Islands and Bismarck Archipelago Campaigns.
Moved the Philippines in 1945, operating primarily over the southern islands. During 1945 aerial targets became increasingly rare, the 419th turned to long range night-time intruding, carrying out the same mission as the aircraft they had originally been stalking ending the war being stationed on Palawan. Personnel demobilized at Clark Field and returned to the United States after the war; equipment remained in the Philippines for reclamation or sent to postwar units.
Inactivated on 20 February 1947 at Puerto Princess, Palawan, Philippines as a paper unit.

Oak Grove-Freedman's Cemetery

The Oak Grove-Freedman's Cemetery is a historic cemetery located at the corner of Liberty Street and North Church Street in downtown Salisbury, North Carolina. The cemetery has served as a burial ground for African Americans since it was deeded to the city in 1770. More than one hundred fifty known and unknown African Americans, both enslaved and free, are buried at the cemetery.
The Freedman cemetery is part of a larger cemetery parcel known now as the Old English Cemetery, which is home to the graves of soldiers who died in the Battle of Camden in 1780 and to British soldiers who died in Salisbury during Cornwallis’ occupation of the city. The two cemeteries were not separated physically until 1842 when a wooden fence was erected around the Old English Cemetery per the will of William Gay. This fence effectively separated the burial sites of African Americans and whites for the first time. In 1855, the fence was replaced with a granite wall, which remains standing today. Between 1903-1940, portions of the Freedman’s Cemetery have been violated causing bodies to disintegrate and markers to be removed. The last standing markers were noted in 1940. The City of Salisbury assumed ownership of the cemetery in 1975, at which time the cemetery was closed to future burials.
In 1998 the Waterworks Visual Arts Center, under the support of the National Endowment for the Arts and other local organizations, embarked on an eight-year effort to restore parts of the cemetery and erect a public art memorial to honor the historic site. Artist Maggie Smith and landscape architect Sam Reynolds were hired to design and create the memorial which was dedicated on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, January 16, 2006. Maggie Smith said of the project that, “the restoration and memorialization of the Oak Grove-Freedman’s Cemetery has one primary goal: to symbolically and literally bring the desecrated part of the cemetery back into the community’s embrace.

Mount Elkins

Mount Elkins, also known as Jökelen (which means "The Glacier") is a dark, steep-sided mountain with three major peaks, the highest above sea level, in the Napier Mountains of Enderby Land. Enderby Land is part of the Australian Antarctic Territory, in East Antarctica. The mountain was named after Terence James Elkins, an ionospheric physicist with the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions at Mawson Station in 1960.
Location.
Some notable geographic features in the general vicinity of Mount Elkins include Cape Batterbee (92 km to the north), the Young Nunataks (7.4 km to the south), Sørtoppen Nunatak (30 km to the east), the Newman Nunataks (26 km to the west), Mount McMaster (97 km to the west), and Mount Kjerringa (57 km to the northeast). The nearest permanently inhabited place is Mawson Station, an Australian research station to the southeast. Molodyozhnaya Station, a former Soviet research station which was mothballed in 1989, is located to the southwest of Mount Elkins.
Mount Elkins is the highest peak in the Napier Mountains. It is the second highest peak in Enderby Land, behind Mount McMaster, whose summit lies at 2830 metres above sea level.
Geology & orogeny.
Much of the East Antarctic craton was formed in the Precambrian period by a series of tectonothermal orogenic events. Napier orogeny formed the cratonic nucleus approximately 4 billion years ago. Mount Elkins is a classic example of Napier orogeny. Napier orogeny is characterized by high-grade metamorphism and plate tectonics. The orogenic events which resulted in the formation of the Napier Complex (including Mount Elkins) have been dated to the Archean Eon. Radiometrically dated to as old as 3.8 billion years, some of the zircons collected from the orthogneisses of the Napier Complex are among the oldest rock specimens found on Earth. Billions of years of erosion and tectonic deformation have exposed the metamorphic rock core of these ancient mountains.
The oldest crustal components found to date in the Napier Complex appear to be of igneous derivation. This rock appears to have been overprinted by an ultra-high temperature metamorphic event (UHT) that occurred near the Archean-Proterozoic boundary. Using a lutetium-hafnium (Lu-Hf) method to examine garnet, orthopyroxene, sapphirine, osumilite and rutile from this UHT granulite belt, Choi "et al" determined an isochron age of 2.4 billion years for this metamorphic event. Using SHRIMPU–Pb zircon dating methodology, Belyatsky "et al" determined the oldest tectonothermal event in the formation of the Napier Complex to have occurred approximately 2.8 billion years ago.
Preservation of the UHT mineral assemblage in the analyzed rock suggests rapid cooling, with closure likely to have occurred for the Lu-Hf system at post-peak UHT conditions near a closure temperature of 800°C. UHT granulites appear to have evolved in a low Lu-Hf environment, probably formed when the rocks were first extracted from a mantle profoundly depleted in lithophile elements. The source materials for the magmas that formed the Napier Complex were extremely depleted relative to the chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR). These results also suggest significant depletion of the early Archean mantle, in agreement with the early igneous differentiation of the Earth that the latest core formation models require.
Ecology.
To date, no flora has been observed at Mount Elkins.
The following species have been sighted within 1.0 degrees of Mount Elkins:
Significance to mountaineers.
The summit of Mount Elkins is higher than that of any mountain in Australia—including even Mount Kosciuszko (2,228 metres), which is one of the Seven Summits. Because of its remoteness it has not become a popular target for peak bagging.
Weather conditions.
The Napier Mountains run northwest from Mount Elkins. To the east is a large valley formed by the Robert and Wilma Glaciers. To the northeast are the Seaton and Rippon Glaciers. All of these glaciers run into the King Edward Ice Shelf. Other notable terrain features in this area include the Beaver Glacier, located to the west of Mount King. Collectively, these terrain features significantly modify weather produced by synoptic scale systems. Dramatic changes can occur over short distances and in short time intervals.
Nearby terrain features.

History.
Mount Elkins was first mapped by Norwegian cartographers from aerial photographs taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition, 1936–37, and named at that time Jökelen (The Glacier). It was remapped by ANARE from aerial photographs taken from an ANARE aircraft in 1956. The Napier Mountains were first visited by an ANARE survey party from Mawson Station in 1960. The survey party was led by Syd Kirkby, and included Terence James Elkins.

Mervyn Silva

Hewa Koparage Mervyn Silva (Sinhala:හෙවා කොපරගේ මර්වින් සිල්වා) (born March 25, 1944) is a Sri Lankan politician, Member of Parliament and government minister.
Political career.
Silva entered politics by joining the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in Hambantota District but later joined the United National Party.
At the 1994 parliamentary election Silva was elected to represent Hambantota District for the UNP. He later rejoined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
At the 2004 parliamentary election Silva was a United People's Freedom Alliance candidate in Colombo District but failed to get elected after receiving only 2,236 preference votes and coming in last place amongst the 23 UPFA candidates in the district. However, in May 2004 he was appointed as National List MP for the UPFA, replacing his wife who had resigned to allow Silva enter Parliament. In January 2007 Silva was appointed Non-Cabinet Minister of Labour.
At the 2010 parliamentary election Silva was elected to represent Gampaha District for the UPFA. Afterward he was appointed Deputy Minister of Mass Media & Information. This caused strong protests from journalists because of Silva's history with the media. Reporters Without Borders described the appointment as "asking an arsonist to put out fires". Silva resigned as Deputy Minister of Mass Media & Information in May 2010 but was immediately appointed as the new Deputy Minister of Highways. 
On 3 August 2010 Silva subjected government official Mohammed Ishan Murshuk to public humiliation by tying him to a mango tree. Silva invited the media to witness the official's humiliation. This resulted in public outrage and demonstrations by government officials. On 10 August 2010 it was announced that Silva had been dismissed from his ministerial post and suspended from the SLFP. However, a subsequent SLFP disciplinary cleared him of all charges and on 8 September 2010 he was reappointed to his ministerial post.
On 11 April 2011, Silva’s Parliament Affairs Secretary Jayasena Mudiyanselage Buddhi with two Policemen in uniform and an underworld gangster who is a henchman of Silva had arrived in an official vehicle belonging to Silva, and attempted to extort five million rupees from a scrap metal businessman in Grandpass. However that businessman who happened to be a friend of the Defence Secretary got them arrested while they were threatening & demanding the kappan money from him. When things became too hot and beyond the control of Silva, he immediately disassociated all connections with Buddhi saying that his Secretary had left the employment couple of weeks before. However even if it is so Silva could not explain; how that person who had left Silva's staff managed to take the official vehicle belonging to Silva and got the two policemen released from the police station in Silva’s electorate on this extortion mission two weeks later.
It is also said that his henchmen were the ones who assassinated the former chairman of Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Relations with media.
On 27 December 2007 Silva and his bodyguards stormed the offices Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation where Silva assaulted SLRC's news director T. M. G. Chandrasekera. SLRC employees then took Silva hostage and demanded he apologise. When Silva refused the SLRC employees assaulted him. However later on Silva's henchmen targeted those SLRC employees involved in assaulting Silva and individually subjected them & their family members to merciless beatings, stabbing and cutting their mouths with barber knives. Most of those SLRC employees had fled Sri Lanka and had sought asylum in other countries.
On 4 August 2008 Silva and his bodyguards assaulted Sirasa TV journalist Saliya Ranawaka and cameraman Waruna Sampath and seized their equipment at the opening of a flyover at Thorana Junction in Kelaniya. Silva was tried for the assaults but was acquitted after the police failed to file any charges against him. However, earlier Silva had agreed to pay the Sirasa cameraman Rs. 750,000 compensation after the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka heard a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the cameraman.
Presence in Mega Star reality show.
However Silva worked in cooperation with media during his appearance in the Swarnavahini Mega Star reality program as a judge. His controversial remarks about the contestants became a wide topic of discussion and drew the attention of the general public. He made many remarks about the opposition MP Rosy Senanayake, MP Ranjan Ramanayaka and MP Upeksha Swarnamali. During the live final show held at Sugathadasa indoor stadium he made many rude remarks over contestant and other judges.

Giling Basah

Giling Basah is a term used by Indonesian coffee processors to describe the method they use to remove the hulls of "Coffea arabica". Literally translated from Indonesian, the term means "wet grinding". Confusingly, the Arabica coffee industry also uses the terms "wet hulled", "semi washed" and "semi dried" to describe the same process.
Most small-scale farmers in Sumatra, Sulawesi, Flores and Papua use Giling Basah. The mature coffee bean, referred to as green coffee bean, is first harvested. In the Giling Basah processing method, farmers remove the outer skin from the cherries mechanically, using locally built pulping machines, called “luwak”. The coffee beans, still coated with mucilage, are then stored for up to a day. Afterwards the mucilage is washed off and the parchment coffee is partially dried for sale, retaining only 30% to 35% of the moisture content.
Processors and collectors then hull the coffee in a semi-wet state, which gives the beans a unique bluish-green appearance. This method is thought to reduce acidity and increase body, resulting in the classic Indonesian cup profile.
The Giling Basah process can create a "goat's foot," a split on one end, in green coffee beans. Sometimes the hulling machine partially crushes a soft bean, giving the bean a shape resembling a cloven hoof.

Black Bayou Lake National Wildlife Refuge

Black Bayou Lake National Wildlife Refuge is one of five refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuge Complex and one of 545 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System. It was established in 1997 through a unique partnership with the city of Monroe, Louisiana. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a free 99-year lease to manage the city-owned lake. 
Wildlife and habitat.
Black Bayou Lake is studded with cypress and tupelo trees, and surrounded by swamps that graduate into bottomland hardwoods and then into upland mixed pine/hardwoods. Cherrybark oak, cedar elm, ash, hickories and willow oak dominate the lower areas while shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, mockernut hickory and post oak dominate the upland sites. Common wildlife seen include alligators, wood ducks, bird-voiced treefrogs, broad-banded water snakes, red-eared sliders, green herons, coyotes, skunks, and white-tailed deer. The refuge supports an excellent fisheries resource and provides valuable habitat for migratory waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, and many resident wildlife species.
Biology professors and students from the University of Louisiana at Monroe have partnered with Black Bayou Lake refuge in research projects on fishes, reptiles and amphibians. The alligator snapping turtle, a species that has declined drastically across most of the south, nests along the shores of the lake. Nest surveys are conducted annually. Reducing the raccoon population helps to prevent destruction of all the alligator snapping turtle nests and many of other turtles species. The refuge has a large nest box program for prothonotary warblers and wood ducks. Wood ducks are banded on the refuge each year.
An area of of former agricultural fields has been reforested with eleven bottomland hardwood tree species. Existing forested wetlands are managed for forest health and wildlife habitat. The small upland area on the east side of the refuge is home to a remnant red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) cluster. Some hardwoods have been removed to create preferred habitat for this endangered species. Establishing the arboretum and prairie demonstration areas required repeated plantings and waterings. Annual mowing or burning maintains the prairie area. Some of the young arboretum trees must be protected from deer and rabbits with wire cages.
Control of exotic species (those not occurring naturally in this area) is a major activity on this refuge. Herbicide spraying helps to prevent water hyacinths from covering the lake. Controlling Chinese tallow trees is a matter of educating the public not to plant them as ornamental shade trees (birds disperse the seeds) and physically removing the trees, which are invading the reforested area of the refuge.

One Card (card game)

One-Card is a matching card game member of the shedding family of games. The general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family. It is played with an ordinary Poker deck and the objective is to get rid of all cards while preventing other players from getting rid of theirs. The game is commonly played in South Korea.
Rules of play.
The dealer deals out seven cards for two players, or five cards for three or more players. When all players have been dealt their hands, one card is laid face-up in the middle of the table to form the discard pile, and the rest of the deck laid face-down beside it forming the stock pile. The Jokers are used.
The player to the dealer's right plays first by following the rank or suit of the first card led, or by playing a wild card. If the players can not follow the lead, they must draw a card from the stock. The players then take turns playing or drawing cards and the first player who plays all his cards out wins the game.
Attack and defense cards.
When an attack card is played, the next player must draw one or more cards, or play another attack card.
Damage adds up (a two, followed by an Ace of Spades has a total damage of six). After drawing because of attack, it is still that players' turn, they may play one or more of the cards that they have just drawn. If they still can not play, they must take another card.
Penalties.
When a player has only one card left, they must call out "One Card", the next player is then penalized by drawing a card. The player who has only one card is penalized in return if someone else calls out "One Card" first.
The stock pile.
The stock pile is the stack of cards that have not yet gone into play. If this pile gets exhausted, and that frequently happens during the game, a player takes all but the last (top) card from the discard pile, shuffle them, to form a new stock of cards.

Miramichi Folksong Festival

The Miramichi Folksong Festival, the oldest folk music festival in Canada, is held annually in Miramichi, New Brunswick, Canada. It was established by Louise Manny in response to a request from Lord Beaverbrook that she document the traditional songs of his boyhood home. It is the longest continuous event of its kind in Canada and one of the longest in North America. The first festival was held in September 1958 at the Beaverbrook Town Hall and Theatre in Newcastle, New Brunswick. The festival is still held at this location, now in August of each year.
Although the festival now is an important draw for local tourism, and features some mainstream talent, the original and primary purpose of the festival is to preserve local culture; thus, highlights of the festival include many amateur, often elderly, local performers. 
Traditional lyrics and music highlighted by the festival have been preserved in the 1968 book "Songs of Miramichi" and in several recordings, including a 1962 Folkways Records album produced by Louise Manny.
Allan Kelly (September 23, 1903- October 1, 2008) was one of the most popular singers and ardent supporters of the Festival. One of his earliest performances, "The Petit Moine", is recorded on the 1962 album.
Raymond and Frank Estey, brothers from Sevogle N.B, sang each year. Afterword, the Esteys entertained the crowd by telling their famous ghost stories.

Dharmachari Aryadaka

Dharmachari Aryadaka (1948–2003), born as Philip Miller in Seattle, Washington, was best known for being the first Buddhist chaplain in Washington state prisons. 
Escaping the draft, Aryadaka traveled the world; he went to India, Nepal, the Himalayas, Morocco, and Afghanistan. He converted to Buddhism in his twenties, during his imprisonment in 1974 for 22 months in Finland on a drug charge, when he joined the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, now the Triratna Buddhist Community. He discovered Buddhism out of his prison experience, when he "took meditation seriously and found dharma in his cell". He returned to the US 1981, and began teaching meditation in his home, and started a family in 1984. 
Aryadaka was ordained as a member of the FWBO in 1984, and was given his name by the order after a three-month retreat in Italy. It means "noble sky-goer" and was given to him because he "embodied lofty and spiritual ideals". While working as a land surveyor, welder, and sculpturist, Aryadaka built up the Western Buddhist Order in Seattle, co-founded the Seattle Buddhist Center on Beacon Hill, and worked with prisoners. He also worked as a volunteer and liaison between prisoners and their families. He was appointed to Washington's Religious Advisory Committee in 1998 and became the state's first paid Buddhist prison chaplain in 2000, illustrating a shift in how prison ministries reached out to less traditional religious traditions.
Aryadaka died in 2003 at the age of 55 from liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus. He had a liver transplant four years earlier.

Regional Council of Unrecognized Villages

The Regional Council of Unrecognized Villages of Negev (RCUV or RCUVN) is a political advocacy group that was established in 1997. It represents the interests of the Bedouin population living in the unrecognized dispersed communities in the Negev Desert in southern Israel.
Structure.
This political advocacy group was created due to the need of the residents of the unrecognized Bedouin communities to promote their interests within the Israeli political system. Members of these communities belong to no municipalities of their own, and thus cannot elect representatives.
Israel refuses to recognize these localities for several reasons. The main reason is the planning issue - the state would like to see the Bedouin living in the planned settlements, like Rahat and Hura. But most of the unrecognized villages are dispersed far apart and are situated in unsuitable places - f.e. military fire zones, natural reserves, landfills, etc. Nevertheless, in the end the state wants to recognize the maximal possible number of these unrecognized settlements and build infrastructure in them. Another reason is an extremely high number of land ownership claims filed by the Bedouin making it impossible to recognize all of them. Negev Bedouin claim the ownership of land totaling some 600,000 dunams (60,000 hectares or 230 square miles) - it is 12 times the size of Tel Aviv.
In 1997 inhabitants of these localities who felt the need for a representative community-based organization founded the RCUV. Then the 45 participating dispersed localities had a total population of 76,000 inhabitants; these communities range in size from 500 to almost 5,000 residents. The RCUV is supposed to be an elected body, and the residents of each community (village) elect a local committee of 3-7 persons, who become members of the general assembly of the RCUV. The general assembly democratically elects the chairperson and the executive committee once every 4 years. To this day, the RCUV is the only body which seeks to represent the interests of residents of the unrecognized villages.
For a long period of time this organization was not recognized by the state apparently because of its anti-Israel stance - it accuses the state in racism and committing crimes, which cannot be considered as a constructive position. Nevertheless its activities might have influenced the government policies to a certain extent and brought some real problems to the light. Now government seeks to involve the Bedouin in finding an ultimate housing solution for them via recognition of most of these previously unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev and offering an appropriate and just resolution of Bedouin land ownership claims.
Background.
In order to understand the role of this organization it's important to know the background of the Negev Bedouin.
Early sedentism.
Negev Bedouins were originally a nomadic society engaged in herding, agriculture and sometimes fishing. Traditional Bedouin lifestyle began to change after the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. At the end of the 19th century, following the need to establish law and order in the Negev, the Ottoman Empire started forcing sedentarization of the Bedouins.
In 1858 a new Ottoman Land Law was issued that offered the legal grounds for the displacement of the Bedouin. Under the Tanzimat reforms the Ottoman Land Law of 1858 instituted an unprecedented land registration process. Few Bedouin opted to register their lands with the Ottoman Tapu, due to lack of enforcement by the Ottomans, illiteracy, refusal to pay taxes and lack of relevance of written documentation of ownership to the Bedouin way of life at that time.
It was a fatal mistake since Israel has inherited and mainly implemented the Ottoman Land Law as the only preceding law frame. While determining the land ownership Israel relied mainly on Tabu recordings whereas most of the Bedouin land fell under the Ottoman class of 'non-workable' (mawat) land and thus belonged to the state under Ottoman law. Moreover, Israel nationalized most of the Negev lands, using The Land Rights Settlement Ordinance from 1969.
Israel's policies regarding the Negev Bedouin at first included regulation and re-location. During the 1950s Israel has re-located two-thirds of the Negev Bedouins into an area that was under a martial law. Bedouin tribes were concentrated in the "Siyagh" (Arabic for "the permitted area") triangle of Beer Sheva, Arad and Dimona. In 1966 they were given Israeli citizenship and the state has started to build planned townships for them.
Government-planned townships.
Between 1968 and 1989 Israeli government established urban townships especially for the Bedouin tribes of the Negev. Within a few years, half of the Bedouin population moved into the seven townships built for them. The largest Bedouin locality in Israel is the city of Rahat, it was established in 1971. Other towns include Tel as-Sabi (Tel Sheva) (established in 1969), Shaqib al-Salam (Segev Shalom) in 1979, Ar'arat an-Naqab (Ar'ara BaNegev) and Kuseife in 1982, Lakiya in 1985 and Hura in 1989. But not all the Bedouin desired urban life.
Unrecognized villages.
Those Bedouin who resisted sedentarization remained in their old scattered villages which are not recognized by the Israeli government and are thus ineligible for municipal services such as connection to the electrical grid, water mains or trash-pickup. Some Bedouin insist on remaining in unrecognized villages in the hope of retaining their traditions and customs. 
Many of the unrecognized Bedouin communities were created in the 1950s when the Israeli army resettled Bedouin from the Sinai desert. Construction in them was carried out sporadically, without any centralized planning, so, for example, no place was left for the community objects, such as schools, clinics or community centers.
Israeli government uses different means in order to attract the Bedouin into the planned settlements, both pleasant and unpleasant. For instance, it offers land lots at very attractive prices and different bonuses. But sometimes the state is forced to implement coercive measures. Following the court order and all the legal procedure it demolishes houses built illegally on what it considers to be state lands. This is done in order to implement law and order in the Negev, as well as to build new settlements both for Jews and for the Bedouin, and improve life conditions of the Bedouin by moving them to townships with a developed infrastructure.
Formation.
The RCUV was formed in the aftermath of 1996 events in the unrecognized village of Umm Batin. A group of local residents tried to resist government's demolition of houses built as a result of squatters' housing. During the relocation of the Bedouin and their active resistance three people were injured, including a child. Following this event, RCUV was created. It consisted of a local committee of traditional leaders joined by several "community professionals".
The founders of the RCUV soon after took on developing a "Plan for the Development of Municipal Authority for the Arab Bedouin of the Unrecognized Villages in the Negev", as an alternative to the Israeli government's standard approach to relocation of residents of the unrecognized villages against their will.
According to Human Rights Watch, when the Israeli Southern District Outline Plan ("Tamam" 4/14/2001) was first formulated, it completely ignored the existence and needs of the Bedouin in the unrecognized villages. After the Association for Civil Rights in Israel petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court in cooperation with the RCUV and the villagers it seeks to represent, the planning authorities acknowledged that "Tamam" had discriminated against the Bedouin.
In July 2001 government planners agreed to meet with community representatives. However, Human Rights Watch says this process dragged on for over seven years, and despite some improvements, in 2008 the Plan still ignored the needs of most of the unrecognized villages.
Establishment of Abu Basma Regional Council.
Answering the housing need of the Negev Bedouin and as a part of the policy of step-by-step recognition of the unrecognized communities where it is possible, the State of Israel went on and initiated a creation of a new regional council whose sole purpose was to unite all the Bedouin communities that previously did not belong to other municipalities in order to solve their problems in a more organized way.
On September 29, 2003 Israeli government has adapted a new "Abu Basma Plan" (Resolution 881), according to which a new Abu Basma Regional Council was formed, unifying a number of unrecognized Bedouin settlements. This resolution also regarded the need to establish seven new Bedouin settlements in the Negev, literally meaning the official recognition of unrecognized settlements, providing them with a municipal status and consequently with all the basic services and infrastructure. The council was established by the Interior Ministry on 28 January 2004.
Moreover, Israel is currently building or enlarging some 13 towns and cities in the Negev. According to the general planning, all of them will be fully equipped with the relevant infrastructure: schools, medical clinics, postal offices, etc. and they also will have electricity, running water and waste control, but it takes time. Several new industrial zones are planned, some are already being constructed, like Idan haNegev on the suburbs of Rahat. It will have a hospital and a new campus inside.
Prawer plan.
In September 2011, the Israeli government approved a five-year economic development plan called the "Prawer plan". One of its implications is a relocation of some 30.000-40.000 Negev Bedouin from areas not recognized by the government to government-approved townships. This will require Bedouins to leave ancestral villages, cemeteries and communal life as they know it.
According to the PMO official press release, the plan is based on four main principles: 
When the cabinet approved it, simultaneously it also approved a NIS 1.2 billion economic development program for Bedouin Negev whose main purpose is to support the Bedouin women and youth in the fields of employment since the Israeli government claims they will contribute to the increased economic growth of the entire Bedouin community. Much of the approved funds will be allocated for the development of industrial zones, establishment of employment centers and professional training. This claim has been resisted by Bedouin people.
According to the Prawer plan, the present Bedouin communities will undergo a comprehensive planning process. The existing communities will be expanded, some unrecognized communities will be recognized and start to receive public services, while their infrastructure will be renewed. All these changes will be done in the framework of the Beer Sheva District masterplan. Most residents will be absorbed into the Abu Basma Regional Council. While the government claims that the nature of these future communities, whether agricultural, rural, suburban or urban will be decided in full cooperation with the local Bedouin and that relocated people will receive new residences, many Bedouin people have found new homes unsustainable, destructive of their communities—and have been forced out of their homes.
The Prawer plan seeks to give an answer to numerous land claims filed by the Bedouin. It will offers significant compensation in land and funds - 50% of the claim (currently it's only 20% offered), while each claim will be dealt in a unified and transparent way provided by law.
It is feared by many that implementation of this plan will lead to forced relocation of the Bedouin from the unrecognized communities in spite of promises that the relocation is done in full coordination with the Bedouin and is voluntary.
Other Bedouin have also been removed with less popular criticism. Good examples in this matter are Tirabin al-Sana and Segev Shalom. After a number of complicated agreements with the state all of the Bedouin of Tarabin clan moved into a township built for them - Tirabin al-Sana. Following negotiations, the Bedouin of al-'Azazme clan will take part in the planning of a new quarter that will be erected for them to west of Segev Shalom township, cooperating with The Authority for the Regulation of Bedouin Settlement in the Negev.
Current role.
According to Maha Qupty (2004), a RCUV coordinator, the council builds community solidarity and mobilizes outside supporters to empower unrecognized villagers "to defend themselves against the onslaught of the State against their lands and livelihoods."
The RCUV seeks to address:
In addition, the RCUV is working with the Abu Basma Regional Council to assure that villages which are "de jure" recognized by the government receive "de facto" recognition through government allowances for herding and agriculture, and the provision of services within a reasonable time frame.
In 2008, the Goldberg Committee, the government body assigned to assess the status and future of the unrecognized villages, reported its recommendations. No member of the RCUV or of the unrecognized villages was included on the panel of the Goldberg Committee. But the RCUV has worked to bring public pressure to bear on the Committee, from the outside.
On the contrary, implementation of the Prawer plan has started from the full cooperation of the government with the Bedouin and several important agreements were made between the Bedouin and the State.

Duke University Hospital

Duke University Medical Center (commonly referred to as Duke University Hospital) is a 924-bed academic tertiary care facility located in Durham, North Carolina. Since its establishment in 1930, the hospital has grown from a small regional hospital to an academic medical center. Duke University Hospital is the flagship teaching hospital for the Duke University Health System, a network of physicians and hospitals serving Durham County and Wake County, North Carolina, and surrounding areas, as well as one of three Level I referral centers for the Research Triangle of North Carolina (the other two are UNC Hospitals in nearby Chapel Hill and WakeMed Raleigh in Raleigh).
History.
1924–1935: early years.
The institution traces its roots back to 1924, six years before the opening of the hospital, when James Buchanan Duke established the Duke Endowment to transform Duke University (then known as Trinity College) into the research university it is today. In 1925, Duke bequeathed $4 million to establish the medical school, nursing school, and hospital. Two years later, in 1927, construction began on the original hospital (now known as Duke South), which opened on July 21, 1930, with 400 beds. In 1931, the hospital and medical school were officially dedicated on April 20 and the Private Diagnostic Clinic (Duke's in-house physician system) was organized on September 16. In 1935, less than five years after the hospital opened, the American Medical Association ranked Duke among the top 20 of medical schools in the country.
1936–1969: a number of firsts.
In 1936, a team of physicians led by Dr. Julian Deryl Hart introduced ultraviolet light to kill germs in the operating room as a way to combat post-operative staph infections, greatly reducing the number of infections and related deaths. In the same year, the hospital established the nation's first brain tumor program, launching what would become one of the world's most renowned programs in the field of cancer treatment. In 1937, Joseph Beard developed a vaccine against equine encephalomyelitis, one of the first known vaccines to combat the mosquito-carried disease.
In 1940, the hospital made its first expansion, adding a new wing to the original building. In 1947, the Bell Research Building became the first freestanding building on the hospital campus. In 1954, the Duke Poison Control Center was organized, becoming one of the first two organized in the country.
In 1955, psychiatrist Ewald W. Busse established the Duke University Center for Aging, the first research center of its kind in the nation. Currently the oldest continuously operating facility in the United States, this center has pioneered long-term studies of health problems among seniors.
In 1956, Duke surgeons performed the first cardiac surgery using systemic hypothermia to bring a patient's body temperature down to less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit in an effort to minimize tissue damage during lengthy surgeries. With the success of this experiment, systemic hypothermia has become standard procedure in all hospitals worldwide. In 1957, the hospital and medical school were renamed Duke University Medical Center. In 1958, Thelma Ingles, a professor and chair of the Department of Medical-Surgical Nursing, developed the clinical nursing specialist program, becoming the first master's program of its kind in the United States. The establishment of the nursing specialist program paved the way for advanced clinical knowledge in the delivery and teaching of the nursing field.
The 1960s brought extraordinary firsts to Duke. In 1963, the first African-American student was accepted to the prestigious medical school. Two years later, in 1965, the hospital established the first physician assistant program in the country. In 1966, Duke became the first medical center in the world to offer radio consultation with physicians in developing countries. This program, called Med-Aid (short for Medical Assistance for Isolated Doctors), met the critical needs of the physicians who lacked proper treatment. That same year, the Medical Scientist Training Program, a joint program leading to simultaneous M.D. and Ph.D degrees, was established, becoming one of the first three in the nation. In 1969, the first recorded studies of human's abilities to function and work at pressures equal to a 1,000-foot (300 m) deep sea dive were conducted in the hyperbaric chamber.
1970–1989: a period of growth and expansion.
With the dawn of the 1970s, Duke underwent a period of expansion that continued well into the 1980s. In December 1971, the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was established under the National Cancer Act. Duke's cancer center, one of the first in the nation under this groundbreaking legislation, was officially designated as a "comprehensive" cancer center by the National Cancer Institute in 1973. That same year, the Duke Eye Center was dedicated and opened on November 8. In 1978, the Morris Cancer Research Building opened, giving researchers a place to study and find cures for the disease.
In 1980, Duke moved into its present $94.5 million facility (Duke North) on Erwin Road, located just north of its original location. In 1985, with the emergence of AIDS bringing alarm to the medical community, Duke became one of the first two hospitals to conduct human clinical trials on AZT, the first drug to offer an improved quality of life in patients battling AIDS.
1990–present: accelerated growth, expansion, and a glance towards the future.
In the 1990s, the medical research at Duke reached the forefront for detection of ailments that can be treated with a larger success rate. In 1990, Duke geneticists invented a three-minute test to screen newborns for over 30 metabolic diseases at one time. This practice has since become standard worldwide.
In 1992, Duke's cancer center became the first hospital to develop an outpatient bone marrow transplant program. That same year, the hospital performed its first lung and heart/lung transplants.
The year 1994 marked the beginning of accelerated expansion for Duke. That year, the Levine Science Research Center and the Medical Sciences Research Center were opened. In addition, there were extensive renovations of the Duke Clinic (Duke South), additions to the Morris Cancer Research Building, a new Children's Health Center, a freestanding Ambulatory Care Center, and expanded parking options for visitors.
In 1998, the Duke University Health System was created with newly established partnerships with Durham Regional Hospital and Raleigh Community Hospital. That same year, the National Institutes of Health partnered with Duke to offer the first joint master's of health science in clinical research degree. With this extraordinary partnership, the NIH became the first organization to offer a joint graduate degree program with a major university.
In 2001, the hospital was the first to establish a center dedicated exclusively to Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
Today, Duke University Hospital is still seeking life-changing breakthroughs to improve the quality of life for everyone in the world. In addition, the hospital is undergoing a major expansion project that will increase the size of its surgical ward and add two additional helipads to the hospital.

Bertrand–Diquet–Puiseux theorem

In the mathematical study of the differential geometry of surfaces, the Bertrand–Diquet–Puiseux theorem 
expresses the Gaussian curvature of a surface in terms of the circumference of a geodesic circle, or the area of a geodesic disc. The theorem is named for Joseph Bertrand, Victor Puiseux, and C.F. Diquet.
Let "p" be a point on a smooth surface "M". The geodesic circle of radius "r" centered at "p" is the set of all points whose geodesic distance from "p" is equal to "r". Let "C"("r") denote the circumference of this circle, and "A"("r") denote the area of the disc contained within the circle. The Bertrand–Diquet–Puiseux theorem asserts that
The theorem is closely related to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.

Frequent flyer program (Guantanamo)

The frequent flyer program is a controversial technique used by the USA in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps, in Cuba. 
Guards deprived detainees of sleep by moving them from one cell to another, multiple times a day, for days or weeks on end.
The technique was used to "soften up" detainees prior to interrogation. Guantanamo guards were ordered to discontinue the use of the technique in March 2004, although the practice persisted until at least later that year. 
Major David Frakt, USAF, defense counsel to a recipient of the program, Mohamed Jawad, said:
In August 2008, in testimony at Jawad's Guantanamo military commission trial, Army officers confirmed the existence of the frequent flyer program.
At least 17 detainees were subjected to the program.
In May 2012 Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer assisting captives with their habeas corpus petitions, reported that the frequent flyer program was still being used as a punishment technique in the isolation block known as Camp Five Echo.

Dances on the Snow

Dances on the Snow is a science fiction novel written by the Russian sci-fi and fantasy writer Sergey Lukyanenko. Despite the fact that the novel was written later, it is considered to be an indirect prequel to the novel "Genome". It takes place in the same fictional universe as Genome, about one hundred years prior to the novel's time frame. Unlike "Genome", "Dances on the Snow" hardly deals with the issue of genetic engineering but does touch on the issue of cloning. However, the biggest focus is the problems of free choice and mind control.
Plot.
Tikkirey "Tiki" Frost lives on the planet Quarry, poorly adapted for human life and stricken with poverty. Due to the planet's high radioactivity, the inhabitants of Quarry are forced to live in a protective dome and pay for food and air, or "social support". Unemployment is a major problem on Quarry. In fact, one's ability to obtain a job depends on the quality of his or her neuroshunt implant, allowing direct mind-to-machine connection. Tikkirey's parents' neuroshunts have become obsolete and they have no money for an upgrade. His father has been unemployed for years, and his mother makes a pittance. Incapable of paying for their social support, Tikkirey's parents are forced to invoke their "constitutional right to commit suicide." For that, Tikkirey's social support is extended by 7 years, during which he can get education and find a job, as his neuroshunt is above the local standard. If his parents forgo their "constitutional right", the entire family will be evicted from the Dome. The life expectancy outside the Dome is 1-2 years.
After losing his parents, Tikkirey decides to leave Quarry by any means necessary. As such, he signs up on an interstellar ore transport as a "calculation module" — a wetware computer used for complex calculations at faster-than-light speeds, as normal computers fail to work. A calculation module remains in suspended animation, most of the time, while a stream of data is shunted through his brain. While this is a highly paid position, continuous misuse of the brain atrophies the frontal lobe, causing the person to lose his free will. After the expiration of the standard five-year contract, 97% of calculation modules are incapable of making their own decisions and continue flying for the rest of their lives. The other 3% manage to muster enough willpower to leave the ship (2%) or cancel the contract before time is up (1%); however, even they have to spend years relearning to make even the simplest decisions (e.g. a simple choice of soft drink is an extremely difficult process for them).
After regaining consciousness on the beautiful and wealthy planet of New Kuwait, Tikkirey demands to cancel his contract and leave the ship. He immediately finds out that a clause in the contract prevents him from doing just that, as he must pay off his 150,000 credit insurance policy, which will require Tikkirey to serve another 1.5 years on the ship. The contract is specifically written to prevent calculation modules from using ships as free rides. Fortunately, Tikkirey finds out that the crew took pity on the boy and broke the law by not getting him an insurance policy. He receives his earned credits and leaves the ship. He then takes a taxi and gets a room at a cheap hotel. He then hits another snag: his money will only last him about a week. New Kuwait's laws require local permanent residency for employment, but the process of obtaining it takes at least six months.
At the hotel, Tikkirey meets Lion, a boy his age, who was born and grew up on a space station. The next day, Tikkirey encounters and befriends a mysterious man named Captain Stas, who turns out to be a phage from the planet Avalon. Phages are knight-like members of an organization whose goal is to rid the Empire of its enemies. Unlike the rational humans around them, phages are encouraged to listen with their hearts. A phage is genetically engineered to be stronger and faster than any normal human. He is capable of using something called an "imperative voice", causing most humans to follow his instructions without question (similar to the Voice from Frank Herbert's novel "Dune"). A phage's weapon of choice is a multi-functional semi-intelligent plasma whip, chosen not for its deadliness but for its psychological effect. The phages' mission, abilities, and moral code have earned them the nickname "jedi", which they tend to dislike, as it trivializes the phages' purpose.
Stas is on a mission to investigate the suspicious activity on New Kuwait of agents from the planet Iney ("frost" in Russian). Iney has already "peacefully" allied with several other Imperial worlds and is gaining in strength, threatening the stability of the Empire. Before Stas or Tikkirey can do anything, most of the population of New Kuwait suddenly falls asleep. Tikkirey and Stas are one of the few still awake. Stas takes the boy and, at Tikkirey's request, the unconscious Lion with him on his ship. They are able to launch before the population awakes and announces its allegiance with Iney. With some quick thinking, Tikkirey connects Lion's brain to the datastream of the ship, temporarily turning him into a calculation module. The plan works, and Lion awakes shortly after. However, his free will is gone. Stas takes the boys to his homeplanet of Avalon, where the phages' headquarters are located. Tikkirey is hired by the phages to work in support role, while he takes care of Lion. Basically, Tikkirey is forced to tell Lion to do almost everything, hoping that he may one day get better. He also makes friends with his neighbors, a brother and a sister of a slightly younger age. One day, Tikkirey is asked by his supervisor to destroy a faulty plasma whip, which refuses to bond with any phage. To Tikkirey's surprise, the whip bonds to him, and he refuses to destroy the semi-living device. That same day, his neighbors invite him and Lion to go camping at a nearby lake. Since it is wintertime in that part of Avalon, the lake is frozen over. The teenagers (except for Lion) begin to ice skate, but ice cracks under Tikkirey, and he falls into the water. He attempts to get out by using the whip but to no avail. Surprisingly, Lion snaps out of his daze and saves Tikkirey. Stas arrives with paramedics and explains that the whip was a test of loyalty, which Tikkirey has failed. Tikkirey shows that the whip bonded to him, which surprises the phage, as this has never happened before. Tikkirey and Lion are taken to the phage headquarters, where Lion is given a clean bill of health by a psychiatrist. Lion explains that, during the time he was asleep, he has lived an entire lifetime as a citizen of Iney. The boys find out that the phages are planning on sending them back to New Kuwait to conduct an investigation as to how Iney is controlling the population.
Tikkirey and Lion are dropped in a pod made of a special form of ice, which melts on landing, leaving no trace. However, the boys are quickly captured by a team of girls armed with crossbows. They are escorted to their base camp, where Tikkirey encounters a disabled old man he met while escaping from New Kuwait. The girls are members of a former hip hop dancing troupe who have become guerrilla fighters. They help the boys sneak into the city, where Lion is reunited with his family, who all behave like a stereotypical perfect TV family. Tikkirey and Lion are sent to a boarding school "to learn to serve the society better." Everything appears to be going well, except that the boys know they are under surveillance. One night, the old man's daughter Natasha sneaks into their room and informs them that Iney counter-intelligence is following their every move. They decide to escape and hide in a school located in a poor district. They are able, for a time, to remain undetected by the Iney. Once, however, Natasha introduces Tikkirey to another girl, who claims to also be an agent for the phages. She informs Tikkirey that a wealthy Imperial industrialist has arrived on New Kuwait and that he is secretly working with Iney against the Empire. The girl orders Tikkirey to execute the industrialist and his teenage daughter. While morally disagreeing with the girl, Tikkirey decides to go through with it. Tikkirey, Lion, and Natasha sneak into the villa where the industrialist is being treated as an honored guest. However, upon attempting to ambush the man and his daughter, Tikkirey is surprised to learn that the industrialist is, in fact, Stas in disguise. His "daughter" is a young phage-in-training dressed as a girl. The real industrialist has been detained by the Imperial forces, and the phages have been sent in their stead. Stas immediately realizes that the girl who gave the execution order is an Iney agent, which means that their cover is blown. He decides to attempt to smuggle Tikkirey, Lion, and Natasha from New Kuwait in suitcases. There is one problem, however — due to a quirk of nature, FTL travel is lethal to human females (the reasoning behind this is not explained, although it is mentioned that a Y-chromosome is necessary to survive an FTL jump). As such, Natasha must be placed into a cryogenic pod. Due to the shortage of space on the luxury transport, the dock workers decide to leave Tikkirey's suitcase in storage to be sent with the next ship. An old female dockworker decides to look inside and finds the boy. Instead of reporting him, however, the old lady feeds him and asks him to tell her what is happening. After hearing his story, Tikkirey asks her to contact Stas and tell him to freeze Natasha. When she comes back, the lady begins to explain certain unknown facts to Tikkirey. She explains that the president of Iney, a woman by the name of Inna Snow, is, in fact, a clone.
At one point in time, a genetic genius named Edward Garlitsky has decided to fundamentally alter humanity for the better. For this purpose, he cloned himself into a woman named Ada Snezhinskaya, but their views on the means of achieving the change were radically different: Edward wanted to act behind-the-scenes (according to the novel "Genome", he became the father of specification), while Ada wanted to directly alter the current social and political structure of the Empire. For that purpose, Ada created thousands of clones of herself and of Edward and spread them throughout the Empire (at that time, it was common practice for parents to buy fetuses). The first names of the female clones were always four letters long with a double consonant in the middle, while the last name was in some way related to snow (e.g. Inna Snow, Anna Neige). Sooner or later, most of the clones were tracked down and offered to have the collective memory of the clones imprinted on them. Most agreed. They all began to set themselves up in certain key political positions. Eventually, Inna Snow discovered a way of using neuroshunts to slowly download a dormant program into people's brains. A certain signal would then trigger the program, which would allow the affected people to live out entire lifetimes in their heads. While each person's "dream life" was different, several constants remained the same: Inna Snow and Iney are good, the Empire and the Emperor are bad. The medium for implanting the program was chosen to be the many TV series produced on Iney and watched throughout the Empire. After hearing this, Tikkirey realizes that the old lady is Ada Snezhinskaya, who reveals that Tikkirey Frost is himself a clone of Edward Garlitsky.
Despite this realization, Tikkirey attempts to kill Ada with a whip, but he only wounds her and gets captured by Iney forces. Finding himself in a prison cell with Stas, the phage-in-training, Lion, Natasha, and her grandfather, Tikkirey questions Stas and finds out that Stas knew about him being a clone. The group is then taken to a factory to meet Ada and Inna, where, after a verbal joust, Stas reveals that the Empire has begun a massive invasion of all Iney-occupied worlds, using a modified version of Inna Snow's program to remove Iney's propaganda from the affected people's minds. In a last-ditch effort to save herself and her plan, Ada uses the imperative voice to order Tikkirey and Natasha to jump off the catwalk into a pool of strong solvent. Natasha's grandfather sacrifices himself to save his granddaughter and push both Ada and Inna off the catwalk. Stas uses his own imperative voice to override Ada's order and frees the teenagers.
With the threat of Iney gone and the clones in custody, Stas offers to take Tikkirey back to Avalon. However, Tikkirey first makes a stop at Quarry to get two of his friends off that rock. As a side note, he mentions that a genetic cure has been found to allow women to safely traverse FTL hyperchannels without the use of cryogenics.

Mustapha Danso (died 30 September 1981) was a constable in the military of the Gambia, who in 1980 killed Emmanuel ("Eku") Mahoney, the deputy commander of the paramilitary field force of the country. Danso's actions ultimately led to an attempted coup d'état in July 1981 and his own execution.
Danso shot and killed Mahoney in October 1980 with a semi-automatic rifle. At his trial in December, Danso was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. The unrest caused by the incident led to the attempted coup which began on 30 July 1981 and was led by Kukoi Sanyang. However, President Dawda Jawara put down the revolt by 5 August with the assistance of Senegalese troops.
On 30 September 1981, Danso was executed in Banjul. He was the first person executed by the Gambia since it gained independence in 1965. After Danso's execution, no other prisoners were legally put to death in the Gambia until August 24, 2012.

Walter Brewster House

The Walter Brewster House is located on Oak Street in Brewster, New York, United States. It was built in the Greek Revival style around 1850 by Brewster, who founded the village that today bears his name.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Currently it is owned and operated by the Landmarks Preservation Society of Southeast as an event venue and cultural center.
Building.
The two-story frame structure sits on a brick foundation atop a hill overlooking downtown Brewster to the rear. Four Ionic columns on each side support the portico, which juts out some distance from the house proper, the only such arrangement on a Greek Revival house in Putnam County. It has a dentiled cornice.
Currently, The Walter Brewster House serves as an event space for weddings, festivals, corporate parties, fundraisers, meetings and cultural events. The house has been carefully restored and with careful curation, the furnishings and artwork inside represent the Village of Brewster's rich history as well as Walter Brewster and John Gail Borden, important former residents of the house who brought industry and economic development to Brewster. 
History.
Brewster, a descendant of the Plymouth Colony Brewsters, bought a farm along with his brother and settled in the area around the mid-19th century. The New York and Harlem Railroad was working its way north from New York City, and he not only built a depot, he laid out the village's Main Street and helped found its first hotel.
After numerous owners, who did not appreciate its historical importance, the building became the property of the Landmarks Preservation Society of Southeast in the 1970s. The society renovated it and made it a cultural center, hosting concerts and special events.

Cape Campbell Lighthouse is a lighthouse at Cape Campbell in the Marlborough region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is owned and operated by Maritime New Zealand.
The original lighthouse at this site was first lit on August 1, 1870. However, this lighthouse was constructed of timber, and in 1898 these timbers were found to be decaying. This led to the construction of the current cast iron tower, which began operating in October 1905.
The light was originally fueled by oil. In 1938 the oil lamp was replaced with an electric one powered by a local diesel generator. This was subsequently replaced by a connection to the mains grid in the 1960s. The light was fully automated in 1986 and is now managed from a control room in Wellington.

Third Finger, Left Hand

Third Finger, Left Hand is a 1940 American romantic comedy film. A woman pretends to be married to fend off would-be suitors and jealous wives, then regrets her deception when she meets an artist.
Plot.
New York magazine editor Margot Sherwood "Merrick" (Myrna Loy) invents a husband (who is conveniently away in remote corners of the world) mainly to safeguard her job. The magazine publisher's jealous wife has had the last two women in her position fired after mere months. It also comes in handy keeping aggressive men at bay, as Margot is determined to succeed in her career. Magazine photographer August Winkel (Felix Bressart) helps by writing letters supposedly from Tony Merrick.
One day, she goes to meet a friend arriving on a passenger ship. However, when she enters her friend's cabin, she finds some paintings, but no friend. Soon after, art dealer Mr. Flandrin (Donald Meek) shows up to examine the works. Irritated by Flandrin's brusk attitude and certain that she can get a better deal for her friend, Margot orders him to leave. However, Margot's friend had gotten off at a prior stop, and the paintings actually belong to Jeff Thompson (Melvyn Douglas). Jeff runs into Flandrin on deck, only to learn that the insulted dealer is no longer interested in selling his artwork. 
When Jeff confronts Margot, she promises to straighten things out. Masquerading as an enthusiastic rival dealer, she manipulates Flandrin into offering Jeff a much better deal than he had ever expected. Mollified, Jeff offers to take her out to dinner to celebrate. She declines, but when her lawyer boyfriend Philip Booth (Lee Bowman) has to cancel their date, she changes her mind.
At the nightclub, a drunken acquaintance spots Margot and mentions her husband, forcing Margot to improvise and tell Jeff that it was merely a passing infatuation in Rio de Janeiro. He believes her at first, but then some inconsistencies in her story cause him to check up on her; he concludes that there is no Tony Merrick.
To teach her a lesson, he shows up at her family mansion and announces to her father (Raymond Walburn), younger sister (Bonita Granville), and butler (Halliwell Hobbes) that "he" is Tony. He is welcomed with open arms. Margot has no choice but to go along with the deception.
The next morning, she confesses all to Philip in order to get some legal advice. Philip tells her she cannot "divorce" a man to whom she is not even married. He suggests she first marry him discreetly, then divorce him publicly. Philip convinces a reluctant Jeff to go along. The couple head off to Niagara Falls to get married. At the falls, Jeff runs into some friends from his Ohio hometown, Wapakoneta. Margot takes the opportunity to exact some revenge, pretending to be a very uncouth wife, complete with an exaggerated New York accent.
Margot, Jeff, and Philip then board a train to drop Jeff off in Ohio. Margot and Philip plan to go on to Reno to secure the divorce, then get married themselves. However, Jeff starts having second thoughts. To buy time, he hires African American train porter Sam (who has been studying law by correspondence) to draw out the property settlement negotiations. It works. When Jeff gets off the train, Margot goes with him.

New World Writing

New World Writing was a paperback magazine, a literary anthology series published by New American Library's Mentor imprint from 1951 until 1960, then J.B. Lippincott & Co. from volume/issue 16 (1960) to the last volume, 22, in 1964.
Rare Library described it as "one of the longest running and very significant paperback magazines in American literature. An institution that sprang up in the 1950s, showcasing original and first appearance of stories, poems, essays, etc. of leading writers from around the world. It has sometimes lapsed, but then returned to life, outlasting imitators in nearly every decade."
A purchase of the anthology was described in Frank O'Hara's poem "The Day Lady Died":
Contributors.
The fourth issue had two contributions by Gore Vidal, who had helped found "New World Writing".
The seventh issue (1955) included the first chapter of "Catch-22" (named "Catch-18" originally) and "Jazz of the Beat Generation" by "Jean-Louis" (actually an excerpt from Jack Kerouac's "On the Road").

Spa in Thailand

Thailand has emerged as the spa capital of Asia in the past couple decades. Drawing on its rich tradition of homegrown remedies and herbal knowledge, the country has tapped into these folk traditions to build a vibrant, modern spa industry. 
Nowadays, spas of sorts and sizes can be found throughout Thailand, but the most famous and exclusive are found in Thailand’s largest cities: Bangkok, Phuket, Pattaya, Koh Samui, Chiang Mai, and Hua Hin. Nonetheless, all major tourist attractions offer a superb choice of diverse spa treatments, offered by the hour, by the week, or by the month, depending on one’s needs, commitment, and investment. 
History.
Introduced in the early 1990s, spas in Thailand are growing in popularity each year. Not only are spas popular and fashionable with foreign tourists and expatriates, but the local Thais are also enjoying this new alternative therapy, one which is often ideal to ensure a smooth natural balance. The emerging middle class and big city dwellers are particularly fond of spas, and enjoy visiting them to relax, cleanse, and purify. At first, spas were only to be found in 5-star hotels but they have now mushroomed everywhere. 
Awards.
Thailand’s prominence in the Spa Industry has been confirmed repeatedly by numerous awards during the past five years. For 2012-2013, Thailand received the “Best Spa Destination (Asia),” Reader’s choice Award from readers of AsiaSpa India Magazine, India’s most popular spa and wellness industry magazine. This was the third time that Thailand has won this award, having previously won the same award in 2008 and 2009. 
Also in 2012, Thailand was awarded the Asian Spa Capital of the Year Award at the 8th Annual Asia Spa Awards. This was only one of five awards that Thailand picked up in the category of Thai Spas, Health and Wellness Resorts, more than any other country received. 
In 2009, Thailand received AsiaSpa Magazine’s biggest prize as well, “Asian Spa Capital of the Year,” during its 5th annual awards. 
Facts and statistics.
During the years 2000–2002, the growth of the spa industry in Thailand rocketed by an exhilarating 64% and since 1999 Thailand has secured itself a top-5 world rating. In fact, Thailand is the second highest ranked spa destination of the world with an overall grade of 93%+ (just slightly behind Australia).
During the period June 2001 – June 2002, 230 operators serviced 2.5 million international clients, creating revenue of $85 million. This amount well exceeds that of competitive countries, such as Singapore ($35 million) and Australia ($15 million). In total, 79% of all clients were foreigners. 
There are 1,463 registered spas, health shops, and other beauty facilities with certificated from the Public Health Ministry of Thailand as of February 2011. Of these, 454 are spas, although there are also many small, unrecognized spas throughout Thailand.
The educational system within Thailand has responded to the demand from the spa industry, and fields of studies within vocational schools, colleges, and universities have expanded accordingly to include healthcare, medical massage, and alternative medical treatment. Thailand now has the capacity to produce about 10,000 trained personnel in these fields to serve the industry annually. 
Thailand’s spas.
There are numerous different types of spa services in Thailand which focus heavily on Thai massage. They are categorized as massage for health, massage for beauty and traditional massage.
The variety of spas in Thailand is wide and is found at almost every destination in Thailand. They are:
Spas in this category include health resorts and retreats that provide customized, personal care to clients wanting to create a healthier lifestyle for themselves. These facilities normally offer multi-day stays where they receive extensive treatment and training. 
During their stays, they can learn and experience a wide variety of treatments and therapies, including yoga, therapeutic massage, fitness classes, beauty treatments, and many more options according to their preferences and needs. 
Among this multitude of hotel, resort, and retreat spas are some of the finest, most beautiful and exclusive spas in the world, including Anantara Spa (Anantara Golden Triangle Resort & Spa),Banyan Tress Spa Phuket, Six Senses Samui. 
Approximately 46% of Thailand’s spas fall into this category. Most of the hotel spas cater both to their own in-house guests as well as being open to outside clients. 
While these day spas cater largely to the tourist market, many office workers and businesspersons in Thailand also avail themselves of their services. They are focused largely on relaxation, stress relief, and cleansing of environmental impurities. Popular day spas include Sukko Cultural Spa & Wellness (Phuket), Oasis Spa Bangkok, Divana Virtue Spa and THANN Sanctuary.
These type of spas are for one-day or less visits, often for a matter of hours only. They offer a menu of a la carte services from which the client can pick and choose. Many of these spas were formerly beauty salons of one type or another, and have evolved into the more popular day spas. 
Medical spas can be found throughout Thailand, but are concentrated in the Kingdom’s larger cities, especially Bangkok, Phuket, Pattaya, and Chiang Mai. There are also dedicated centers such as St. Carlos Medical Spa, Balanze by Hydrohealth and TRIA. 
Popular spa treatments in Thailand.
Centuries worth of tradition have devised many different methods. They include pastes, mud-packs, specialized oils, muscle kneading and water jets. More of them are:
A massage is the most popular technique offered at spas in Thailand. The statistics concerning Thai spas conclude that 85% of the treatments given are massage. There are however, many different types of massage:
Other types of massage in Thailand include:
Thailand offers a myriad of spa treatments. In addition to those mentioned above, other methods include colon cleansing, meditation and a wide range of beauty treatments.

Snake Island (Victoria)

Snake Island is a 15m2 tree island, the largest in Surf Cresent, Victoria, Australia. It lies within Flinders and is part of a complex of a snake infested dam.
As the island is remote and relatively unspoilt it is popular for hoons to ride motorbikes and many tracks can be taken on the paddock as it has crazy long grass. A diverse range of bushes and fauna makes the island particularly interesting for bush jumpers.
History.
Snake Island is part of the traditional territory of the Brataualung clan of the Gunai people, who named it "Negima". As well as being a place of refuge, it was used as a nuptial island for young couples. Since the 1880s the island has been used by South Gippsland farmers to agist cattle in winter, swimming their stock over a narrow channel at low tide.
Flora and fauna.
The vegetation communities of Snake Island include woodland, scrubland, heath, freshwater swamps, mangroves and salt marsh.
Mammals found on the island include the native Eastern Grey Kangaroo, Swamp Wallaby, Koala and Swamp Antechinus, as well as the introduced Hog Deer. There are many birds present, including the Eastern Ground Parrot. Large numbers of migratory waders roost along the coast after feeding on the inlet's extensive intertidal mudflats.

<doc id="18766525" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18766525" title="Zortziko">
Zortziko

The zortziko is a dance rhythm that originates in the Basque Country. It is also used as an accompaniment rhythm for vocal melodies, such as "Gernikako arbola", the “unofficial anthem” of the Basques, composed in 1853 by José María Iparraguirre (Laborde 2001).
The zortziko has a distinctive 5/8 time signature, consisting of three subdivisions of 1, 2, and 2 beats. Some theories hold that the zortziko rhythm evolved from a 3/4 time signature that was deformed to more closely follow the beat structure of traditional Basque dance music. Others hold that it is in 5/4 time, "like the Rueda except that the 2nd and 4th beats are almost always dotted notes" (Kennedy 2006), or that it actually a double compound meter combining an irregular binary (5/16 divided 2 + 3) and an irregular ternary (8/16 divided 2 + 3 + 3), creating an ostinato pattern of "irregular bichrome" measures, which in Constantin Brăiloiu's terminology is called an aksak rhythm (Laborde 2001).
The instrumentation typically used to execute the zortziko rhythm are the txistu and the tamboril.
Despite the zortziko's origins and continued popularity in folk music, some composers (including Charles-Valentin Alkan, Aita Donostia, Jesús Guridi, Gabriel Pierné, Maurice Ravel (in his piano trio), Pablo Sorozábal, and José María Usandizaga) have also incorporated it into classical music.

Isolation (health care)

In health care, isolation refers to various measures taken to prevent contagious diseases from being spread from a patient to other patients, health care workers, and visitors, or from others to a particular patient. Various forms of isolation exist, some of which contact procedures are modified, and others in which the patient is kept away from all others.
Isolation is most commonly used when a patient has a viral illness. Special equipment is used in the treatment of patients on the various forms of isolation. These most commonly include gowns, masks, and gloves.
Forms of isolation.
Strict isolation.
Strict isolation is used for diseases spread through the air and in some cases by contact Patients must be placed in isolation to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Those who are kept in strict isolation are often kept in a special room at the facility designed for that purpose. Such rooms are equipped with a special lavatory and caregiving equipment, and a sink and waste disposal are provided for workers upon leaving the area.
Contact isolation.
Contact isolation is used to prevent the spread of diseases that can be spread through contact with open wounds. Health care workers making contact with a patient on contact isolation are required to wear gloves, and in some cases, a gown.
Respiratory isolation.
Respiratory isolation is used for diseases that are spread through particles that are exhaled.Those having contact with or exposure to such a patient are required to wear a mask.
Blood and body fluids precautions.
This method is used when there is concern about communicable diseases found in a patient's body fluid. Health care workers making contact with the patient when body fluids are involved must wear gloves
Reverse isolation.
Reverse isolation is a method to prevent a patient in a compromised health situation from being contaminated by other people or objects.
Effects of isolation.
Isolation can have the following effects on patients:
Diseased workers.
Health care workers who become infected with certain contagious illnesses are not permitted in many places to work with patients. While facility rules and laws vary, a common guideline that has been set is 48 hours.

<doc id="18766590" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18766590" title="Odd lotter">
Odd lotter

An odd lotter is an investor who purchases shares or other securities in small or unusual quantities. Stocks are typically traded in increments of 100 shares, a quantity known as a "round lot" or "board lot". The cost of 100 shares of a security may be beyond the means of an individual investor, or may represent a larger investment than the investor wishes to make. Thus, the investor purchases an odd lot.
Odd lot theory.
Odd lotters were central to a historical theory of technical analysis known as odd lot theory. Odd lot theory was predicated on the belief that one could outperform the stock market by identifying the least-informed investors and making investments opposite to them. (If the least-informed investors were selling, it was generally a good time to buy, and vice versa.)
Assuming that odd lotters were generally smaller investors with little market knowledge, practitioners of odd lot theory identified the actions of odd lotters and did the opposite. The actions of odd lotters were interpreted as contrary signals.
The theory is no longer popular as analysis of data shows little evidence that the method works. According to Princeton University economist Burton Malkiel: "It turns out that the odd-lotter isn't such a stupendous dodo after all. A little stupid? Maybe. There is some indication that the performance of odd-lotters might be slightly worse than the stock averages. However, the available evidence indicates that knowledge of odd-lotters' actions is not useful for the formulation of investment strategies."
The theory was the subject of much analysis in the 1960s and 1970s. By the 1990s, however, the theory had fallen out of use. In addition to the theory's general ineffectiveness, more and more individuals began to invest in mutual funds instead of individual stocks.
The term odd lot existed prior to use in finance and is used outside the financial industry for any irregular packaging in a general and objective sense.

The Guilt of Janet Ames

The Guilt of Janet Ames is a 1947 drama film. A widow sets out to find the five men whose lives were saved by the sacrifice of her husband in World War II and judge whether they are worthy.
Plot.
Bitter war widow Janet Ames (Rosalind Russell) seeks out the five soldiers for whom her husband gave his life by falling on a hand grenade during the Battle of the Bulge. While crossing a city street to find the first, she is struck and knocked unconscious by an automobile. The police find no identification on her, only a list of names. One recognizes the last name on her list, Smithfield "Smitty" Cobb (Melvyn Douglas), a reporter recently fired for alcoholism, and contacts Smitty. When Smitty sees the list, he realizes who she must be.
He goes to see her at the hospital, and finds her in a wheelchair, unable to walk. As the doctor can find no physical reason for the paralysis, he schedules an appointment with a psychiatrist. Smitty decides to treat her himself. He introduces himself as a friend of her husband David (though not as one of the men he saved), and wheels her into a private room. She explains her mission: to see if any of the men were worth David's sacrifice, making it perfectly clear that she has already made up her mind. After a nurse gives her a sedative, Smitty accuses her of wallowing in self-pity, then tries to get Janet to change her mind by describing each of the men. He is so vivid that Janet can see and talk to them.
The first man she interacts with is nightclub bouncer Joe Burton (Richard Benedict). He and his singer girlfriend Katie (Betsy Blair) dream of building a house. Joe constructs a model of it from a deck of cards. Exasperated by their unrealistic aspirations, Janet blows the cards down.
Next, Smitty takes her to the desert, where Ed Pierson is doing scientific research and living in a shack with his wife Susie (Nina Foch). Janet does not meet Ed at all; instead, she talks with Susie and her very wealthy father, who strongly disapproves of what the couple are doing. He wants Ed to come work for him, but Susie replies that Ed is happy where he is and would be miserable in the business world. Janet states that her husband would never do what Ed has done.
The third man is Frank Merino (played by an uncredited Hugh Beaumont). Janet first meets his young daughter Emmy. During their conversation, Janet states that she and David were too sensible to have children before they were ready and that children are a lot of trouble. A bewildered Emmy seeks comfort from her father. 
Sammy Weaver (Sid Caesar), the fourth man, is a promising, up-and-coming comedian. After entertaining Janet and Smitty with his routine, he thanks her for the opportunity to lift the spirits of his audience.
By this point, Janet has guessed Smitty's identity. He describes himself as a crusading journalist and newspaper editor.
Janet then admits that she feels overwhelming guilt in not loving her husband and making his civilian life so miserable, he had little to lose when he sacrificed himself. David wanted to build a house and have a child right away, but she put them off until it was too late. She also made him decline a research position and keep working at a job he hated for her own security. Smitty persuades her to forgive herself, and the paralysis in her legs goes away. 
However, when she tells him that she has fallen in love with him, he brushes her off and retreats to his favorite bar to drown his own troubles. Janet then learns from a policeman that Smitty is not exactly what he claimed. She tracks him down and extracts from him the reason for his alcoholism. It turns out Smitty, as David's commanding officer, ordered him to throw himself on the grenade, when Smitty was just as close to it. Janet tells him that David would have done so without being ordered, and that he probably never even heard the command. She then turns the tables on her healer, describing their happy future life together.

John W. Dickenson

John Wallace Dickenson (born 22 January 1934) is an Australian inventor, who developed some liquid flow measuring devices and designed a successful hang glider configuration. He is recipient of the "Gold Air Medal", the highest award given by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the world governing body for air sports, aeronautics and astronautics world records.
The Ski Kite.
In 1963, after seeing an image of a Rogallo wing airfoil, specifically "Ryan research aircraft" on a magazine, Dickenson set to build a water skiing kite that could be released at altitude for a glide to a safe drop in the water after releasing from the wing, thus designed and built a water skiing kite wing he called the "Ski Kite".
His ski kite format incorporated an airframe with a triangle control frame as used in hang gliding in Breslau 1908, having a basebar tow-point and was integrated on an all-ready publicized four-boom stiffened Rogallo wing airfoil, where the pilot sat on a swinging seat while the control frame and wire bracing distributed the load to the wing as well as giving a frame to brace for weight-shift control. Dickenson's Ski Wing turned out to be stable and controllable, unlike the flat manned kites used at water ski shows. The Ski Wing was first flown in public at the 'Grafton Jacaranda Festival', New South Wales, Australia, in September 1963 by Rod Fuller while towed behind a motorboat.
The Ski Kite was light and portable like the prior instances of the same wing earlier by others such as James Hobson, Charles Richards, Thomas H. Purcell of which he had not studied, so Dickenson decided to file for a mechanical patent, but lacking on economic resources, the patent process of formal review of claims could not be entered to determine which, if any, of the claims could hold, so the patent was not awarded. Since the single hang point and triangle control frame had already been in public domain, those two claims globally would not have stood the test of professional scutiny; the full mechanics were freely already available in John Worth. A full year prior the four-boom stiffened Rogallo-wing hang glider by James Hobson had been publicly shown in Sport Aviation magazine of the Experimental Aircraft Association and also displayed for viewer in the USA national television program Lawrence Welk Show. A controversy has been growing about the claim of global mechanical invention by a friend of John Dickenson in the 2000s; such is affecting the legacy of John Dickenson and the integrity of the invention-merit sector of the sport of hang gliding.

Legacy.
Dickenson's hang glider format was further developed by other builders and directly helped to build the popularity of hang gliding around the world in the 1970s and 1980s.
It is certain that many people from many countries, made contributions to the development of the flexible wing hang glider to the extent that any global mechanical claim for invention would be untenable. In the aviation context of 'first flights' and recreational vs. commercial developments, new and old inventions often complement in synergy; it is in this evolutionary and social context that the crucial developments put together by Otto Lilienthal, Gustave Whitehead,Francis Rogallo, John Worth, Barry Hill Palmer, Charles Richards, Cecil E. Craigo, Peter F. Girard, Thomas H. Purcell Jr., and many other before John Dickenson, were the ones that were most successful and influential on the evolution of stiffened four-boom hang gliders. John Dickenson was a ski-kite leader; he never foot-launched a hang glider but was a leader in the delta waterski sport.

The squadron was formed on 22 January 1945 at RAF Andover as an RCAF unit -albeit not in the 'Article XI' sequence of squadron numbers, but in a 'normal' British sequence- its principal role being to direct artillery fire from the air. The pilots were officers recruited from the Royal Canadian Artillery and trained to fly at 22 E.F.T.S. (Elementary Flying Training School) Cambridge, further developing advanced flying skills at 43 Operational Training Unit RAF (43 OTU), RAF Andover. The first Commanding Officer was Major Dave Ely, RCA. The operational Commanding Officer selected to take the squadron to war was Captain G.A. 'Tony' Eaton, MC, RCA; Eaton was killed in a flying mishap near RAF Middle Wallop on the night of 1 March 1945. Major Norbert Reilander, RCA, from No. 664 Squadron RCAF, was chosen to take command of 665 Squadron in the first week of March 1945. The squadron operated in England under the overall control of No. 70 Group, RAF Fighter Command; prior to deployment to the European continent the squadron was transferred to No. 84 Group, RAF Second Tactical Air Force (2 TAF).
On operations.
The squadron began deploying to the Netherlands on April 19, arriving at B-77 Gilze-Rijen airport on 21 April 1945. The principal aircraft flown in action was the Taylorcraft Auster Mk.V. 'B' Flight of 665 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF, was credited with firing the last Canadian shot of the war in Europe at Dunkirk, France, on 7 May 1945. After V-E Day on 8 May 1945, the squadron was tasked with flying mail and passengers for 1st Canadian Army, while one section and its aircraft was seconded to Allied Headquarters at Frankfurt, Germany, for U.S. Intelligence duties. 
No. 665 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF, was disbanded at 'JOE' airfield, Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, on 10 July 1945. The squadron had no official motto or heraldic badge assigned to it.
Aircrew or not?
Formation of the three Canadian war-time A.O.P. squadrons was historically the first example of 'unification of services,' a generation before the Canadian Forces experienced total unification. These, however, were not 'co-operation squadrons.' Although 665 squadron's trained aircrew observers acquitted themselves admirably in aerial action against the enemy, aircrew associations across Canada did not grant membership to AOP observers, as those aircrew were not officially issued with cloth wings during the war.

Brandon Paris

Brandon Paris (born Richard Lee, legally changed his name in 1998) was born on November 11, 1971 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and is the lead singer and front man for Brandon Paris Band. After graduating high school in 1989, he went to Red River College to study Criminology in hopes of joining the Winnipeg Police Service, but that same year dropped out. At the age of 18, Brandon started making T-shirts under a brand name he called "Express Clothing". He started selling T-shirts out of the trunk of his car; eventually, his clothing line was carried at two of the largest clothing chains in Canada (at the time), Bootlegger, and Below the Belt. The company dissolved after three years because of poor business decisions based on little experience.
A three-year relationship ended with his girlfriend during the same week of the official dissolve of his business, which led to Brandon's attempted suicide in 1993. Brandon was admitted in St. Boniface hospital where he had his stomach pumped. One month later, his father talked him into moving to Surrey, BC to work for his multimedia company. Paris worked for 7 years as a digital video editing/3D animator helping build his fathers home based business into one of the most recognized video production/duplication companies in British Columbia. By 1998, Brandon became addicted to drugs which led him into a deep depression. This depression helped him find a new love for music, that he claims, helped him find his way out of his two-year drug addiction.
In 1999 Paris left his fathers business to pursue a career in Music. He sold all of his belongings within two weeks, and moved to Long Beach, California with $7,000 cash in hopes of putting together a band. While eating only oatmeal everyday and living in cockroach infested apartments, Brandon immediately took vocal lessons and went to the library each day educating himself with books on song writing and the music business. After running out of money within 1 year, Brandon became desperate for money, and attained an illegal green card and visa papers. Only 2 weeks later he was soon caught and deported back to Canada.
Brandon started writing and performing his own songs as a solo artist locally from 2001 to 2002. He independently financed the recording of his solo album which took two years to complete but released songs to radio with no success. With what took over three years, Brandon Paris's newly formed Band was completed. Brandon re-recorded half the album with Troy Samson of Hipjoint Productions (Moka Only, Kreesha Turner, Snoop Dogg) and Jeff Dawson (State of Shock, Kelly Rowland, Daniel Powter, Marcy Playground), Paris officially changed the name from "Brandon Paris" to "Brandon Paris Band" in 2006 and decided they were finally ready to shop their debut album now titled "On My Own".
In January 2006, Brandon Paris Band signed a deal with Koch Entertainment literally overnight just days after sending out their album to record labels across Canada, with many offers following. Their debut albums' first single, "Rewind and Start Again", was a huge success on commercial radio after being released on March 13, 2006. The song climbed up to top 20 on the Canadian CHR charts (tracked by Radio & Records (Billboard Information Group)). The second and third singles, "Somebody to Hold" and "Give Me a Reason", were also well received in many cities but not enough to reach top 40 status in Canada. Topping off an already exceptional year, Brandon Paris Band was nominated for Best New Group or Solo Artist (CHR) by the Canadian Radio Music Awards in spring of 2007.
Life and music career.
Early life 1971 - 1988(Winnipeg, Manitoba).
Paris's mother, Junette Lee, was born in Singapore and father, Edward Lee, was born in Trinidad & Tobago. Brandon Paris's original legal name was Richard Brian Edward Lee. He was born in St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba Brandon has three brothers, one of which is an identical twin. All the children lived in an extremely strict household as his father once served in the RAF (Royal Air Force).
Brandon grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in Southdale where he went to Shamrock Elementary school. Paris's mother and father moved to British Columbia in 1986 to start life over during a deep depression his father went into after losing his business of 30 years. Brandon and his twin brother stayed with his grandmother in Winnipeg to finish off the rest of his years in high school at J. H. Bruns Collegiate. For the next few years he struggled in high school while working a full-time job. Paris went in and out of depression many times as he was very much affected by the physical and abuses of his adolescent years. Paris's family did not know of the sexual abusive neighbour at the time nor was the man ever charged as he moved out of the country before Brandon reached 10 years old. Brandon never realized how much all of this affected him until the later 90's. Aside from all the negative situations, Brandon was known to be a talented artist from a very young age and excelled in all his art classes all the way through high school. He also attained his black belt at Kangs Taekwondo [http://www.kangs.mb.ca/] before he reached the age of 13.
1989 - 1993: The young entrepreneur.
During the late 80's in Winnipeg where young local owners of clothing companies like Mondetta Clothing Company and Chip and Pepper where flourishing. Brandon now 19 years old and still in high school, was determined to do the same and started making t-shirts in a friends basement with a brand name he called "Express Clothing" meaning, expressing ones self with clothing. He started selling T-shirts out of the trunk of his car at parties, high schools and nightclubs. As the demand became too high for the supply, Brandon could not make clothing fast enough and needed to get his clothing manufactured by a larger clothing manufacturer, Nygård International, who required minimum orders and deposits which Brandon could not meet. David Lee, Brandon's Uncle, became involved as his financial partner. Brandon heard that Bootlegger (At the time was Canada's largest retail clothing chain), was known for helping out local Winnipeggers. Luckily their main office for making purchases was in Winnipeg. Paris set up a meeting and came over with sample clothing articles to show to the company's purchasing executives. 1 week later Bootlegger faxed in their first order of Express clothing to be distributed within their stores across Canada. Eventually the second largest clothing chains in Canada (at the time), Below the Belt started carrying the clothing line. Paris set up sales representatives in Saskatchewan, Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta. The company was growing too fast with quality being sacrificed which led to the company dissolving only 2 years later. Brandon's poor business decisions were to blame. A three-year relationship ended with his girlfriend during the same week of the official dissolve of his business, which let to Brandon's attempted suicide in 1993. Brandon was admitted in St. Boniface hospital where he had his stomach pumped. Although the company did not even come close to the success of Mondetta or Chip & Pepper, it is now looked back as quite a success story in regards to what he accomplished at 18 years old on his own with no experience in the clothing field in such a short time.
1994 - 1996: Multimedia career (Surrey, British Columbia).
One month later, his father talked him into moving to Surrey, BC to work for his multimedia company. "Edward Lee Productions Inc", in Surrey, BC. In the summer of 1994 Brandon picked up and moved to Surrey to start life over again. Through training from his father, seminars, technical courses and video's, Brandon mastered many aspects of business (sales and marketing) and multi-media including, linear/digital video editing on Avid/Media 100, 3D animation (Lightwave 3D), Compositing effects using (After Effects), graphic design (Photoshop)and video duplication. Brandon started on wedding projects and soon after moved up to working on corporate videos, music videos, and TV commercials. In 1996 Brandon's father won Surrey's Entrepreneur of the Year Award and eventually expanded into a bigger location. In 1997 his father won "Vancouver Ethno-Canadian Entrepreneur Of The Year Award" which once again propelled the business into high sales. At the end of 1997, Brandon started feeling the stress from the long 18–22 hour days, pressure from his father, and low pay. Brandon started taking medication to help cope with the anxiety. He also gained more than between 1996 and 1997 which caused him to developed type-2 diabetes.
1997 -–1998: The depression.
. By 1998, Brandon became addicted to methamphetamines and ecstasy which led him into a deep depression. This depression helped him find a new love for music, "I would sing to songs on my stereo that dealt with the same thing I was currently going through at the time." Paris says. "Little did i know that my singing voice was getting stronger by the month. I started singing at parties for fun, Many people would compliment on my vocals or say i should seriously think about getting into a singing career. I rolled it off my shoulder at first but admit that the thought of becoming a singer started growing on me by the day." He claims music helped him find his way out of his 2 year drug addiction. "I wrote all my feelings down on paper every night when i was coming down from my high. "It wasn't until close to the end of my addiction that it dawned on me why i was doing so much drugs. It was because i was masking all of the terrible things i went through as a child, one of them, being sexually abused (by nearby neighbor) at a young age for many years without my family knowing." Paris says. "singing and writing was like being at a session at the psychologists office every night. I finally got all the skeletons out of the closet and dealt with it for the first time. This was the biggest turning point in my life. It was only then when I knew I somehow had to take both my love for writing and singing and make this a career." Brandon legally changed his name from Richard Lee to Brandon Paris in 1998 as he believed it was like starting life all over and a way of leaving all the evils in his past behind. He chose "Brandon" as his first name because of his most loved actor and martial artist Bruce Lee, whose son was named Brandon. he chose the well known city "Paris" as his last name because he felt it was more marketable and thought it would be much too hard to market a popular, unoriginal Chinese last name "Lee". Brandon also changed his appearance by losing 126 lb (from down to ). Brandon was used in television and newspaper ads as a "success story" for several years for Fitness world,
1999 -–2006: Music Career.
With absolutely no training, experience or knowledge in playing, writing or even singing music, in 1999 Paris left his fathers business to pursue his new chosen career. He sold all of his belongings within 2 weeks, and moved to Long Beach, California with $7,000 cash in hopes of putting together a band. Brandon immediately took vocal lessons and went to the library every day educating himself with books on song writing and music business. Paris did not succeed at putting together a band. After running out of money within 1 year, Brandon became desperate for money, and attained an illegal green card and visa papers. Only 2 weeks later he was soon caught and deported back to Canada.
Paris immediately got a job with a nightclub in downtown, Vancouver in 2000, where he worked as a busser at night. This allowed him more time to learn guitar, take vocal lessons with Juno Award Winning, Patricia Dahlquist and write songs. He started writing and performing his own songs as a solo artist locally from 2001 to 2002. He independently financed the recording of his solo album which took 2 years to complete but released songs to radio with no success. Brandon could not release many of the songs due to debt in the studio and co-writes he could not buy out, the songs still sit on the shelf.
Fall of 2002 Brandon was approached by Dave Devindisch (former bassist of the defunct Vancouver band called DDT) while performing at a concert at the Croatian Culture Center in Vancouver where he asked if he would be interested in recording a demo at his home studio. Brandon agreed and soon after, Dave and Brandon formed a two man band playing at local venues. In 2003, Paris decided to finally record a full album with Ninjabeatz Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia, where reggae artist Dagriff was recording his solo album. Dagriff was approached by Paris and asked if he would be interested in collaborating on one song from the album he was recording. Soon after, Dagriff joined the band and became a huge influence on the band's music. Dagriff was eventually featured on more than half the album which took over two full years to eventually complete. In 2004, Greg Ellis was asked if he would play guitar on a couple songs for the album which resulted in him joining the band as well. In 2005, Chris Murray Driver, who was friends with Dave Devindisch, joined the band, and only a few months later talked his friend Marc Gladstone (keyboards) into joining the band. Both Marc and Chris are former members of the band Doug and the Slugs.
In spring 2005, Paris tried to release the songs independently to radio with no success. A few months later he approached Vancouver-based record producer Troy Samson of Hipjoint Productions (Moka Only, Kreesha Turner, Snoop Dogg) and Jeff Dawson (State of Shock, Kelly Rowland, Daniel Powter, Marcy Playground), to rework six of the original recordings. This took the whole project to a new level. Paris changed the name from "Brandon Paris" to "Brandon Paris Band" and decided they were finally ready to shop their debut album now titled "On My Own".
in January 2006, Brandon Paris Band signed a deal with Koch Entertainment literally overnight just days after sending out their album to record labels across Canada, with many offers following. Their debut albums' first single, "Rewind and Start Again", was a huge success on commercial radio after being released on March 13, 2006. The song climbed up to top 20 on the Canadian CHR charts (tracked by Radio & Records (Billboard Information Group)). Their debut albums' second single, "Somebody to Hold", was released after its very successful first release Rewind and Start Again, which hit top 20. The song was also well received in many cities. It unfortunately peaked at #53 on CHR (tracked by Radio & Records(Billboard Information Group)). Koch Entertainment, Brandon Paris Band's record label, decided to release "Give Me a Reason" only a month after the release of Somebody to Hold, in hopes of getting better results, but to their dismay it was not enough to reach top 40 status. Only a couple months later it quickly lost its momentum on the radio once the funding towards radio promotion stopped. It was believed that the timing, and lack of funding for marketing the singles release was partially to blame. Topping off an already exceptional year, Brandon Paris Band was nominated for Best New Group or Solo Artist (CHR) by the Canadian Radio Music Awards in spring of 2007.
2007 -–present: The Second Album.
In January 2007, Ellis and Devindisch were replaced by Brian Jasper on guitar and Brian Sanheim on bass. Paris started writing songs for the second album while working at his current job. The band members have all been working hard to follow up their break through album "Pocket Full of Holes". "We've been exploring all sorts of directions and have come up with an even more innovative sound with stronger lyrics and powerful hooks which we feel will get the attention not only from Canada again, but the USA as well", says Paris. Lyrics on every song are written by Brandon with two songs co-written with Dagriff ("masquerade" and "Twisted"), one song co-written with Marc Gladstone ("Don't Fade"), and one song co-written with the entire band, "Voice Inside My Head", All music is written by Bryan Jasper with additions and changes by the rest of the band, except three songs ("Don't Fade", "Voice Inside My Head" and "Never Get Enough")
“Pocket Full of Holes" was independently released in Canada December 1, 2008 in hopes of a big follow up of their breakthrough album On My Own. On November 3, 2008, Brandon Paris Band independently released their first single called "Say Goodbye" from their 2nd album titled “Pocket Full of Holes” to radio. "Say Goodbye", mixed by Mike Fraser (AC/DC; Hedley) and mastered by Adam Ayan (Rolling Stones; Linkin Park), is currently receiving airplay across Canada, including reporting stations, digital stations and satellite. Additional credits on “Pocket Full of Holes” include Jeff Dawson (State of Shock, Kelly Rowland, Daniel Powter, Marcy Playground; State of Shock), Sheldon Zaharko (Salteens, Billy Talent, Smugglers, New Pornographers, Barney Bentall, Ridley Bent) at Vancouver's legendary Factory Studios, (Juno-nominated) Joao Carvalho (Hedley, Alexisonfire, Protest the Hero, David Usher, Matthew Good, Holly McNarland) in Toronto. To add to the success of "Say Goodbye", a video was filmed for the song which was directed, shot, and edited by the lead singer himself with a $4.00 budget. The video has been downloaded thousands of times within weeks of its posting gaining quickly in popularity.
Current Personal Status.
Brandon married Renee Lavigueur on July 28, 2007. Renee has also been involved with the marketing of Brandon's music to this present date.

Peter A. Sarpy

Peter Abadie Sarpy (1804–1865) was the French-American owner and operator of several fur trading posts, essential to the European-American development of the Nebraska Territory, and a thriving ferry business. A prominent businessman, he helped lay out the towns of Bellevue and Decatur, Nebraska. Nebraska's legislature named Sarpy County after him in honor of his service to the state.
Biography.
Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Sarpy moved with his parents and siblings to St. Louis, Missouri as a child. The family was French Creole, and joined other ethnic French in migrating to the growing town of St. Louis after the Louisiana Purchase by the United States. Its lucrative fur trade and much of the economy was originally dominated by ethnic French families.
Nebraska Territory.
In 1824 at the age of 19, Sarpy went to the upper Missouri River, in the Nebraska Territory, to work at the American Fur Company's trading post at Council Bluff, north of present-day Bellevue, Nebraska. That company was owned by renowned fur baron John Jacob Astor. Sarpy next worked for his brother's father-in-law, John Pierre Cabanné, who ran Cabanne's Trading Post. 
Cabanné's Post and Pilcher's Post, the latter established at Bellevue by the Missouri Fur Company, competed for the fur trade of area Indian tribes: the Siouan-speaking Omaha, Ponca, Otoe, and Pawnee. The Missouri Fur Company was founded by French Creole families in St. Louis. Some of their ancestors had migrated to the new settlement of St. Louis in the late eighteenth century from farms in Illinois. They left when the latter was transferred from French to British control after the Seven Years War. More migrated after the American Revolution, as they wanted to evade US Protestant rule in Illinois. 
The fur trade in the region yielded such profits that for decades it was the most important driver of the St. Louis economy. In 1821 it represented $600,000 of the town's annual commerce of $2 million. 
Sarpy later established a trading post and supply point for white settlers and pioneers on the Iowa side of the upper Missouri River. It went by various names, including Sarpy's Point and the "Trader's Post".
In 1832 Cabanné ordered Sarpy to head a group of American Fur Company employees to take over a keelboat and goods which belonged to a competing company. Because of its profits, the fur trade business had cutthroat competition. After they were caught, US authorities ordered Cabanné and Sarpy to leave the Indian Territory for a year. The company replaced Cabanné with Joshua Pilcher at Cabanné's Trading Post in North Omaha. Sarpy operated the Council Bluff trading post during 1835.
Colorado.
Sarpy moved westward the next year, and in 1837 he established Fort Jackson on the upper South Platte River in present-day Colorado. 
Returning to Nebraska.
In 1838, Sarpy returned to the Bellevue area and built another trading post. After Sarpy returned, he became influential in community affairs. About 1846 Sarpy started a ferry business across the Missouri, between Bellevue and the Iowa side. Through the next year, he ferried Mormons across the river and supplied them for the rest of their westward trip. During the ensuing gold rush years, Sarpy's ferry boats hauled many of the would-be gold miners across the Missouri River. Sarpy expanded his ferry business in two other locations: to cross the Elkhorn River at Elkhorn City, later called Elk City, and also at a fork of the Loup River near present-day Columbus. By the 1850s, his fleet included a steam ferry.
Through his efforts, in 1849 an area post office, mark of a rising town, was established in Bellevue. Following the United States' negotiation in 1854 of a treaty by which the Omaha people ceded their land in Nebraska, that year Sarpy was among the group that laid out the town of Bellevue. In 1857 Sarpy joined Stephen Decatur and others in founding Decatur along the Missouri in northeastern Burt County.
Sarpy and his family moved to Plattsmouth in 1862. He died there on January 4, 1865.
Marriage and family.
Sarpy married "Ni-co-mi" (also spelled "Ni-co-ma"), of the Iowa people. She brought her daughter Mary Gale to the marriage. "Ni-co-mi" had been the consort of the American surgeon John Gale, who had been stationed at Fort Atkinson. When it was closed in 1827 and he was reassigned, Gale left "Ni-co-mi" and Mary behind. Sarpy and "Ni-co-mi" also had children together. 
As an adult, Mary Gale (also known as "Hinnuaganun," or One Woman) married Joseph LaFlesche, a Métis fur trader of Ponca and French descent. Adopted as a son by the chief Big Elk and designated his successor, LaFlesche became the last recognized principal chief of the Omaha and the only one to have had any European ancestry.

Early life.
Petrine Archer-Straw grew up in Birmingham, England during the 1960s in an atmosphere of “... racial pride, and activism” (Back to Black 35). Her father arrived England in 1955 as a linotype press operator and subsequently sent for his family to join him. (BTB 35) Archer Straw notes that her home was a hub for the community (BTB 36). These were extremely formative experiences for the young Archer-Straw who also recalls how she “would do the rounds Sunday with my father, ... joining in house to house campaigning and, in the summer, attending the numerous rallies and protest marches. (BTB 36). However, this community work eventually drew the ire of the right wing British National Front and the family subsequently moved to Jamaica, where Dr. Archer Straw finished high school and started university.

Dieter Noll

Dieter Noll (December 31, 1927 – February 6, 2008) was a German writer. His best known work is the two volume novel "Die Abenteuer des Werner Holt" from the early 1960s which had sold over two million copies by his death.
Life.
Dieter Noll was born in Riesa, Saxony to a pharmacist. His mother, who was half Jewish, suffered from repression after the Nuremberg Laws were enacted in Nazi Germany. Noll attended an Oberschule before being drafted as a Luftwaffenhelfer, or assistant in the Nazi air force. Noll served as Luftwaffe support personnel in the Schweren Heimatflakbatterie 210 in Borna district of Chemnitz, though at the end of 1944 he became a soldier in the Wehrmacht. Towards the end of the war, he was captured as prisoner of war by the Americans. After his release, he took his Abitur, or school-leaving certificate, in Chemnitz. He began a study of art history, philosophy and German at the University of Jena in 1948. After 1950 he lived in Berlin as a contributing editor of the Bodo Uhse published newspaper "Aufbau" and an employee of the socialist "Neues Deutschland". From 1956 onwards, he worked as an author. Noll lived in Königs Wusterhausen, where he also retired.
Noll belonged to the Communist Party of Germany after 1946. From 1964 to 1967, he was a member of the SED Bezirk (district) of the party's Berlin leadership. Because of his faithfulness to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Noll resisted the protest with which numerous East German authors had reacted to the naturalization of Wolf Biermann after 1976. In May 1979 Noll described in an open letter to Erich Honecker the authors Stefan Heym, Joachim Seyppel and Rolf Schneider as ""kaputte Typen"" (broken types) who, allegedly, were turning their craving for admiration into no lesser an evil than an actual class enemy might have been. These questionable letters helped bring about exclusion of new authors from the Schriftstellerverband of East Germany in June 1979.
Perhaps most notably, Dieter Noll reported in the early 1950s about the building phase of East Germany. His main work is the two-volume autobiographically shaped novel "Die Abenteuer des Werner Holt". In the first volume, Holt's development, through Nazism, shaped candidates for the Luftwaffenhelfer and Wehrmacht to the military prison. The reader can follow Holt's beginning doubts by the end of the Third Reich. The second volume portrays the difficult development of a Wehrmacht soldier during the beginnings of Socialism. The work has been published, selling two million copies. The first volume was filmed and integrated into the East German school curriculum.
Dieter Noll was a member of the Schriftstellerverband (Writer's League) of East Germany beginning in 1954, and from 1963 to 1966 was acting chairman of the organization's Berlin chapter. He belonged to the Akademie der Künste in East Berlin after 1969. He received the following awards: the 1955 Literature Prize of the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB), the 1961 Heinrich Mann Prize, the 1963 and 1979 National Prize of East Germany, Second Class, the 1964 Johannes R. Brecher Medal in Gold as well as the 1979 Art Prize of the FDGB.
His son Hans, born in 1954, goes by Chaim Noll and lives as an Israeli writer. Dieter Noll died in the night of February 6 of cancer in Zeuthen.
