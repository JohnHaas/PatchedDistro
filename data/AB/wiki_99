SPAWN

SPAWN, the Salmon Protection and Watershed Network, is a project of the Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN), a United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit environmental organization.
SPAWN's stated mission is to "protect endangered salmon in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed and the environment on which we all depend." SPAWN uses a multi-faceted approach to accomplish their mission including grassroots action, habitat restoration, policy development, research and monitoring, citizen training, environmental education, strategic litigation, and collaboration with other organizations and agencies.
Lagunitas Creek Watershed.
The Lagunitas Creek Watershed in Marin County, California has been identified as the most important spawning and rearing habitat for wild coho salmon left in California. Coho in the Central California Evolutionarily Significant Unit (CCCESU) are a Federal and State listed Endangered Species considered to be "in imminent danger of extinction."
Despite having the best run of wild coho left in the State, estimated at up to 30 percent of the State’s total in 2007, only on average 500 adult salmon currently return each year to spawn here. The Lagunitas Creek Watershed is also important habitat for federally listed steelhead and California freshwater shrimp.
SPAWN performs its work with the assistance of volunteer and pro bono contributions. Many dedicated individuals in the San Geronimo Valley, Marin County, and the greater San Francisco Bay Area have made a lasting impact on the accomplishments and history of SPAWN.
History.
The seeds of SPAWN, the Salmon Protection And Watershed Network, were planted when biologist Todd Steiner, the founder, discovered migrating coho salmon stuck at Roy’s Dam in 1997 on the San Geronimo Valley Golf Course, unable to migrate upstream to spawn and complete their amazing life history. Steiner contacted the media to expose the plight of these recently listed endangered species and contacting National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) asking for an emergency permit to move the fish above the crumbling dam obstruction. 
That night on the news, the plight of the salmon was beamed into Bay Area homes on five TV stations. Steiner set up his young son’s painting easel at Roy’s Dam with a hastily written petition asking for government action, as hundreds of people came forward to witness the spectacle first hand, sign the petition, and offer help. Residents, the general public, NGOs and government agencies came together to fix the immediate problem and Roy’s Dam was transformed into Roy’s Pools.
SPAWN has grown from an all-volunteer organization to one with a full-time staff who coordinate the work of hundreds of volunteers and interns. In 1999 SPAWN was incorporated as a program under the umbrella of the non-profit 501(c)(3) environmental organization Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN).
Programs.
SPAWN drives seven active programs and campaigns that focus on protecting endangered salmon and the Lagunitas Creek Watershed. These include habitat restoration, fish rescue, citizen training, creek monitoring, creek walks, land acquisition and water conservation.
Habitat restoration.
Each year SPAWN volunteers contribute many hundreds of hours towards restoring streamside habitat in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed. Volunteers work to plant native trees and understory plants, and remove invasive species. In 2005 SPAWN launched a community-based native plant nursery program that serves to grow thousands of native plants to support local restoration programs and provide plants to landowners living along stream corridors in the San Geronimo Valley.
Fish rescue.
SPAWN’s fish rescue program focuses on fish relocation efforts within the San Geronimo Valley in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed. Streams are surveyed and as it becomes apparent that pools will dry completely, and based on previous years observations at known sites, relocation efforts begin. Relocation usually begins in June but can start as early as April depending on creek flows and rainfall. Over 15,000 juvenile coho and steelhead have been saved from imminent mortality since this effort began in 1999. Rescue and relocation efforts take place under State and Federal permits.
Citizen training.
SPAWN organizes and facilitates a number of citizen training programs that includes a Creek Naturalist Training, native plant collection and propagation, salmon seminar series, spawning salmon surveying and water quality monitoring.
Creek monitoring.
SPAWN oversees a number of creek monitoring programs including water quality monitoring, out-migrant salmon smolt monitoring, and spawning salmon monitoring. Each year SPAWN also responds to many calls from concerned citizens about problems or emergencies on their property or at large. Staff and volunteers respond to these calls and help refer problems to the appropriate agencies if necessary or find ways to prevent or repair the problem.
Creek walks.
During the winter season (Nov-Jan) SPAWN organizes weekly creek walks in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed for the public to view spawning salmon and provide education on watershed management issues. The walks are led by volunteer Naturalists that are trained through SPAWN’s annual Creek Naturalist Training Program each October.
Land acquisition.
SPAWN’s land acquisition program is focused on efforts to protect riparian habitat along the Lagunitas Creek Watershed from increased development. SPAWN is promoting the creation of a land conservancy to protect the riparian habitat through land acquisition and conservation easements on private parcels along the watershed.
Water conservation.
SPAWN’s water conservation program is focused on reducing the impacts of stormwater runoff on local streams and ensuring adequate in stream flow and spawning and rearing habitat for coho salmon and steelhead in the Lagunitas Creek. In partnership with the Marin Community Foundation, SPAWN recently launched a community-based program, the Marin County Stormwater Catchment & Water Conservation Initiative, to provide technical support, cost-share support and incentives to landowners who reduce runoff from their properties using roof-water harvesting techniques.
Accomplishments.
Since SPAWN’s beginnings in 1996 the program has achieved a number of accomplishments:

Héctor Timerman

Héctor Marcos Timerman (born December 16, 1953) is a Jewish- Argentine journalist, sociologist, political and human rights activist, diplomat, and current Argentine Minister of Foreign Relations.
Life and times.
Timerman was born in Buenos Aires to Risha (née Mindlin) and Jacobo Timerman.
He was named editor-in-chief of "La Tarde" in 1976, and steered the daily in support of the newly installed dictatorship. His father's April 15, 1977, kidnapping prompted Héctor Timerman to become active in the defense of human rights, however, and in 1978, was exiled in New York, where, in 1981, he co-founded Americas Watch, the western hemisphere chapter of Human Rights Watch. He later served in the board of directors of the Fund for Free Expression, a press freedom advocacy group based in London.
Timerman earned a master's degree in international relations at Columbia University in 1981, and wrote extensively as a columnist for the "New York Times", "Los Angeles Times", "Newsweek", and "The Nation". Returning to Argentina in 1989, he founded two news magazines, "Tres Puntos" and "Debate", and became a regular contributor to "Noticias" and "Ámbito Financiero". He also hosted a television news interview program, "Diálogos con Opinión". Timerman was an early adherent to Congresswoman Elisa Carrió's center-left ARI. Following elections in 2003, however, he became a close supporter of President Néstor Kirchner.
Timerman remained active in human rights advocacy. He served as a director of the Buenos Aires office of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights from 2002 to 2004, and was President of the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience. Timerman was the first witness to give testimony in the trial of Christian von Wernich, a former Buenos Aires Province Police chaplain convicted of complicity in numerous dictatorship-era murders and tortures (including that of his father).
President Kirchner appointed Timerman Consul General in New York in July 2004, and in December 2007, he was named Argentine Ambassador to the United States. Differences between President Cristina Kirchner and Foreign Relations Minister Jorge Taiana, and an incident in which she called his loyalty into question reportedly led to Taiana's June 18, 2010 resignation; his replacement by Héctor Timerman was announced the same day.
In 2011, he penned a letter to his Bolivian counterpart that was diplomatically correct, but strongly worded. Timerman expressed it was a "grave incident" that the Iranian Defence Secretary Mr. Ahmad Vahidi was given a State Visit to Bolivia, whereas Argentina considers Mr Vahidi to be a wanted suspect. Vahidi left the country. In 2012, he expressed that Prince William's RAF search and rescue uniform during his service on the Falkland Islands was "that of a conqueror".
In 2013 Timerman walked away from a member of the Falkland Islands parliament and refused to accept a letter. Timerman claimed "We have been trying to find a peaceful solution for 180 years. I think the fanatics are not in Buenos Aires" despite Argentina invading the Falkland Islands in 1982.

I'm Outta Time

"I'm Outta Time" is a song by English rock band Oasis, featured on their seventh studio album, "Dig Out Your Soul". The second single from the album, succeeding "The Shock of the Lightning", "I'm Outta Time" was written by lead vocalist Liam Gallagher and released on 1 December 2008.
Composition.
The song bears similarity, in style, to John Lennon's work in the early 1970s. The piano which features on the track partly emulates that of Lennon's "Jealous Guy", with the three octave jumps in C major. The song also has a backing piano part similar in content to that of The Beatles' "A Day in the Life", which also contains a three octave jump in C major. Liam jokingly claims that it took him nine years to write the song. However, in a different interview Liam Gallagher claimed that he wrote the song "While sitting on the end of my bed".
The song features a short speech sample from John Lennon taken from one of his last interviews in 1980. The speech sample says: "As Churchill said, it's every Englishman's inalienable right to live where the hell he likes. What's it going to do, vanish? Is it not going to be there when I get back?".
Reception.
The song has been noted as one of the highlights of the album by fans, as well as the band themselves, with guitarist Noel Gallagher labelling it "deceptively brilliant". It has also been praised by music critics, with "NME" calling it a return to form, and comparing it to the music of Oasis-admired rock band The Beatles.
It charted at number 12 in the UK Singles Chart – the first Oasis single to miss the top ten since 1994, ending the band's streak of 22 consecutive top tens. It spent only two weeks in the UK top 75, the least ever by any Oasis single. Although only peaking at number 48 in France, the song spent a total of 28 weeks in the French Singles Chart, the most ever by any Oasis single.
Music video.
The music video for "I'm Outta Time" was released in November 2008. Filmed in black and white, it shows Liam Gallagher, the only band member to appear in the clip, on a "surreal journey through a moon-lit English landscape". At the end of the video, Liam is filmed in a close-up profile shot lying down. This bears resemblance to the back cover artwork for John Lennon's album "Imagine". It also resembles the cover of Lennon's 1973 album "Mind Games".
Covers.
The song was covered by singer Lily Allen on BBC's Live Lounge on 2 December 2009.

Domnall mac Muirecáin

Domnall mac Muirecáin (died 884) was a King of Leinster of the Uí Fáeláin sept of the Uí Dúnlainge branch of the Laigin. This sept had their royal seat at Naas in the eastern part of the Liffey plain, Airthir Liphi. He was the son of Muirecán mac Diarmata (died 863), a previous king.
There is much confusion in the king lists during this period for Leinster. Francis John Byrne suggests that the root of this apparent confusion lay in the fact that the Uí Dúnlainge kings exercised little real authority due to the aggressions of their western neighbour Cerball mac Dúnlainge (died 888), King of Osraige. Cerball, while unable to install himself as king of Leinster, was able to prevent any rival king exercising real power there. 
Domnall would have succeeded his father as head of the Uí Fáeláin sept in 863. His predecessor as King of Leinster, Ailill mac Dúnlainge of the Uí Muiredaig sept had died in 871, however Muiredach mac Brain (died 885) of the Uí Dúnchada sept is associated with the Leinster forces in association with events in 870 and 875. According to the "Chronicum Scotorum" and other Irish annals, Domnall assumed the kingship of Leinster in 880. This would place his effective reign in 880-884. 
In 874 the high king Áed Findliath (died 879) had invaded Leinster in an attempt to impose his authority and he plundered the country and burned churches including Cell Ausili. In 880 the new High King Flann Sinna (died 916) attacked Leinster and took hostages imposing his authority.
In 884 Domnall was killed by his own associates. His brother Cerball mac Muirecáin (died 909) became King of Leinster in 885.

Dabinett

Dabinett is a variety of apple, customarily used in Somerset for making cider. 
History.
Dabinett probably dates from the early 1900s, when it was found by William Dabinett growing as a wilding (a natural seedling) in a hedge at Middle Lambrook, South Petherton, Somerset. The exact genetic makeup of Dabinett is unknown, though one 'parent' was probably the Chisel Jersey apple, a similar late "bittersweet" variety. The variety became very popular and was widely planted across the south-west of England.
A seedling of this variety, known as Black Dabinett, also locally known as "Tommy Rodford", arose at Kingsbury Episcopi near Martock. It is similar to Dabinett proper but is purplish in colour and generally more vigorous.
Characteristics.
Classed as a "bittersweet" cider apple, Dabinett has small, yellow-green fruit flecked with red, usually harvested in November in the United Kingdom. The flesh is greenish and aromatic. The tree has a relatively small and spreading habit; it has a high resistance to apple scab.
The fruit is of sufficient quality to make a single varietal cider, and a number of commercial cider manufacturers produce ciders made solely or primarily with Dabinett apples, including The Tricky Cider Co, Thatchers and Sheppy's.

Winnona Park Historic District

Winnona Park is a historic neighborhood in the southeast corner of the Atlanta, Georgia suburb of Decatur. It is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places,
Winnona Park is located south of downtown Decatur; west of the Village of Avondale Estates, Georgia and the Forest Hills subdivision; and east of Decatur's Oakhurst community. It primarily consists of residences, but is also known as the home of Columbia Theological Seminary. Its rough boundaries are Mimosa Drive and the Decatur city limits on the south; East College Avenue and the railroad tracks on the north; South Candler Street on the west; and South Columbia Avenue on the east. In addition, the commercial buildings on the east side of South Columbia Ave. at East College Ave. have historically been part of this community. This commercial cluster historically housed the neighborhood pharmacy, gas station and barbershop.
The early families of Winnona Park also have historic links to Agnes Scott College, which adjoins Winnona Park on the northeast. However, the "South Candler Street—Agnes Scott College Historic District" is listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places. The City of Decatur has also designated South Candler Street - Agnes Scott College as a local historic district. Bounded by East College Ave., South McDonough St, South Candler St., East Hill St. and East Davis St., it is no longer considered part of Winnona Park.
In addition, the Forrest Hills community east of South Columbia Avenue is located in unincorporated DeKalb County, and is not considered part of Winnona Park. However, the City of Decatur announced in 2008 that they were considering the annexation of Forrest Hills.
History.
Winnona Park contained farms and estates in the 19th century. “Winnona” is named for the Winn family, who came to DeKalb County, Georgia in the first half of the 19th Century. James J. Winn was a clergyman and a surgeon in the C.S.A. His son-in-law, George Bucher Scott, began the development of Winnona Park. The 1868 farmhouse of another early settler, James C. Avary, still remains on South Columbia Drive. The "Avary-Fulton House", named after the Avary and Fulton families (that constructed and later purchased the home, respectively), was part of a farm that listed 19 slaves in the 1860 census.
During the U.S. Civil War, Union troops first occupied Decatur in July 1864. An 1864 map of Decatur shows Union trenches along East College Avenue, from South Columbia to Adams Street, just south of the railroad tracks. This gave the Union troops strategic control of the rail line. The Union troops, under General Schofield, were driven north through Decatur to the cemetery by Confederate troops under General Wheeler. However, the city fell again to the Union again shortly before the Battle of Atlanta.
The North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, purchased a small farm on the east side of South Columbia Drive in 1873 and relocated from Norcross, Georgia. By the start of the 20th century, 125 boys and girls lived at the "Decatur Orphans' Home" (as it was then known). The campus is presently known as the "United Methodist Children's Home".
The development of Winnona Park as a residential area began in the early 20th century. George B. Scott, a member of the Scott family that founded Agnes Scott College and Scottdale Mills, purchased the property from Dr. James Avary and began developing it.
The earliest business district began at East College and South Candler.", In 1913, Joseph Hughey operated a drug store, which was across the railroad tracks from Decatur’s train depot. (This location now houses Farmstead 303.) In 1923, the Winnona Park Elementary School was constructed; the original school building is still used by the City of Decatur Schools and is the centerpiece of the community.
Architecture.
Winnona Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its late 19th- and early 20th-century American Movement buildings. It contains numerous architectural styles, including craftsman bungalows, Georgian Revival and English Country. Prominent architect Leila Ross Wilburn designed homes on Avery Street. Notable residences include:
Churches.
Winnona Park religious congregations include:
Transportation.
Winnona Park is near major transportation arteries, but has a limited number of roads connecting it to downtown Decatur due to the east-west rail line.

Blanket training

Blanket training is an approach used to train toddlers and pre-schoolers to attain self-discipline. Proponents believe that with consistent training, the child will acquire an ability to play contentedly and quietly by her/himself for an extended period of time. 
A parent designates a certain amount of time (usually 15–45 minutes, depending on the age of the child) that a child must sit by him/herself on a blanket on the floor. The child is not permitted to leave the perimeter of the blanket, and may play quietly with a toy while seated on the blanket. The desired outcome is that after daily training in this manner, eventually the child will sit and play quietly on the blanket whenever and wherever the child is asked to do so. 
The blanket training method may result in negative developmental outcomes. A child's cognitive skills are just developing at this age and by restricting a child from movement, exploration physically and mentally, and vocalizing their feelings will severely inhibit a child's developmental process. Blanket training is not a recommended form of self-discipline. 
Known practitioners of the practice include the Duggars

James Bertram (Carnegie secretary)

James Bertram (1872–1934) was the personal secretary of Andrew Carnegie, the industrialist and philanthropist, from 1897-1914. Bertram also served the Carnegie Corporation of New York from its inception in 1911 as secretary and trustee until his death in 1934. He thus continued to have an important role in Carnegie's philanthropic projects after Carnegie's death in 1919.
Early life.
Bertram was born near Edinburgh, the Scottish capital. His first position was with a railway company in Edinburgh. He emigrated to South Africa, where he continued to work in the railway industry. He returned to Scotland for health reasons in 1897, and was recruited by Andrew Carnegie, who had recently acquired a Scottish home, Skibo Castle.
Activities in the USA.
In the USA Bertram took a close interest in the new Carnegie libraries, commenting on the architectural plans submitted by applicants. Bertram's interventions discouraged extravagant architectural features and encouraged adherence to published guidelines. Bertram also involved himself with grants for pipe organs, and other projects. Booker T. Washington's published correspondence gives details of how Bertram acted as an intermediary between Carnegie and the recipients of his largesse.

NUT Motorcycles was a British motorcycle manufacturer founded in Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1912 by Hugh Mason and Jock Hall, who had previously been making motorcycles since 1906 under a badge based on Mason's initials, HM, and later under the name of Jesmond and Bercley. By 1913 their racing motorcycles were competing successfully in the Isle of Man TT races and Hugh Mason's JAP engined NUT motorcycle won the 1913 Junior TT by just 46 seconds. Originally based on JAP and Villiers engines, NUT began to build their own V-twin sports machines. Following further racing success Mason and Hall moved to larger premises but the company could not survive the First World War and was declared bankrupt. The business was bought by Robert Ellis who restarted in 1921 as Hugh Mason and Company, but it foundered in 1922. Between 1923 and 1933 they continued to make motorcycles under the NUT name but in 1933 the company closed for good.

Sheriff of Nottingham

The Sheriff of Nottingham is an important figure in the legend of Robin Hood. The holder of the office of Nottingham's Sheriff, it is his task to capture outlaws such as Robin Hood, either to ensure the safety of trade routes through Sherwood Forest, or to keep them from poaching the King's deer. In some stories, the Sheriff of Nottingham is portrayed as having a lecherous desire for Robin Hood's lady, Maid Marian. He is widely considered to be the principal villain of the Robin Hood stories, appearing frequently alongside such enemies of Robin Hood as Sir Guy of Gisbourne or Prince John (though rarely both).
The legends are generally set far from Nottingham, this fits the historical position of High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests (from 1068 until 1568). In the film "", the Sheriff's influence has grown so great he attempts to take control of the throne, due to his power outside the region of Nottingham.
In some versions, the Sheriff is more a cowardly schemer while his assistant, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, is a more competent and determined physical threat to Robin. In other versions, the Sheriff answers to Prince John, who is the main villain.
The historical sheriff upon which the stories are based may have been William de Wendenal, Roger de Laci, or William Brewer.

Legia Poznań

Legia Poznań (full name "Sport Club Legia Poznań") is a defunct Polish football club from Poznań. Founded in 1922, Legia was the second strongest team in the city of Poznań, behind Warta Poznań. Its team was nine times champion of Poznan’s A-Class Regional League (see: Lower Level Football Leagues in Interwar Poland) - in 1927, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933,1934, 1934/1935, 1937/1938 and in 1938/1939. Despite these successes, Legia never managed to win promotion to the Ekstraklasa. It was closest in the 1939 qualifying games, when it faced three opponents - Śląsk Świętochłowice, Junak Drohobycz and Śmigły Wilno. However, the outbreak of World War II cut these games.
After the war, the new, Communist government of Poland did not favor prewar teams, and Legia, as well as Warta, were sidelined, and replaced with Lech Poznan. Legia Poznan ceased to exist in 1949.

Thomas Hancock (inventor)

Thomas Hancock (8 May 1786 – 26 March 1865), elder brother of inventor Walter Hancock, was an English inventor who founded the British rubber industry. He invented the masticator, a machine that shredded rubber scraps and which allowed rubber to be recycled after being formed into blocks or sheets.
Early life.
Hancock was born in 1786 in Marlborough, Wiltshire, and little is known about his early life. His father was a cabinet maker and it is possible that Thomas Hancock was trained in the same trade: in 1815 he is recorded as being in partnership with his brother, Walter, in London, as a coach builder.
Career.
Hancock's interest in rubber seems to have sprung from a desire to make waterproof fabrics to protect the passengers on his coaches. By 1819 he had begun to experiment with making rubber solutions. In 1820 he patented fastenings for gloves, suspenders, shoes and stockings; in the process of creating these early elastic fabrics, Hancock found himself wasting large amounts of rubber. He invented a machine to shred the waste rubber, his "Pickling machine" (or "masticator" as it is now known). He called it by the deceptive name of "Pickling" because he initially chose not to patent it, instead preferring to rely on secrecy.
In 1820, Hancock rented a factory in Goswell Road, London, where he worked raw rubber with the machines he had invented. His machines produced a warm mass of homogeneous rubber that could then be shaped and mixed with other materials, and was more easily dissolved than raw rubber. The prototype of his masticator was operated by one man and could only hold ; it was a wooden machine with a hollow cylinder studded with metal "teeth", with an inner studded core that was hand-cranked. By 1821 he had produced a two-man machine that held , and by 1841, he had created a machine that could process up to of rubber at a time.
Hancock experimented with rubber solutions and in 1825 patented a process of making artificial leather using rubber solution and a variety of fibers. His choice of solvents, coal oil and turpentine, was probably influenced by Charles Macintosh’s 1823 patent. In the same year he began working with Macintosh to manufacture his "double textured" fabric.
By 1830 it was obvious to everyone concerned that Hancock’s leather solution, prepared with his masticated rubber, was better than Macintosh's. The two inventors merged their companies and began more fully cooperating, constructing, for example, an automatic spreading machine to replace the paint brushes previously used by Macintosh.
In 1834, Hancock’s London factory burned down and Macintosh had already closed his Glasgow factory. The work was moved to Manchester where, in 1838, another fire destroyed that factory. A new factory was soon built and business continued as before, even though Macintosh’s 1823 patent had expired in 1837. It was only in 1837 that Hancock finally patented both his masticator and spreader (UK patent 7,344).
Although the Mackintosh style of coat has become generic (abbreviated as mac or mack), the company that Macintosh and Hancock established lives on as Mackintosh and continues to make rubberized Mackintosh coats using the same techniques and procedures pioneered by the two inventors.
Vulcanisation.
On 21 November 1843, Hancock took out a patent for the vulcanisation of rubber using sulphur, 8 weeks before Charles Goodyear in the US (30 January 1844). He mentioned in his "Personal Narrative" that his friend William Brockendon invented the word vulcanisation from the God Vulcan of Roman mythology. Hancock did not credit himself with discovering the reaction of sulphur with rubber; he instead said that in 1842 Brockendon had showed him some American rubber samples which had been treated with sulphur.
Brockendon later said in an affidavit that he never heard or knew of Hancock analysing the Goodyear samples, a claim Hancock verifies in his "Personal Narrative", where he claimed he had been experimenting with sulphur for many years himself. A number of chemists also swore that even if he had analysed Goodyear’s material, this would not have given him enough information to duplicate the process. Alexander Parkes, inventor of the "cold cure" process (vulcanization of fabrics using sulphur chloride in a carbon disulphide solution), claimed that both Hancock and Brockendon admitted to him that their experiments on the Goodyear samples had enabled them to understand what he had done.
The firm had large display stands at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1857 Hancock published the story of his life’s work as "The Origin and Progress of the Caoutchouc or India-Rubber Industry in England". 
Death.
He died 26 March 1865, at Stoke Newington.

<doc id="18831419" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18831419" title="Alaska Communications System">
Alaska Communications System

The Alaska Communications System (ACS), also known as the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS), was a system of cables and telegraph lines authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1900 and constructed by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The communications lines were to serve both military and civilian needs in the territory of Alaska. By 1904, ACS comprised some of undersea cable, 1,400 plus miles of land lines, and a wireless segment across at least . On May 15, 1936 WAMCATS was renamed the U.S. Army Alaska Communications System. The Alaska Communications System remained under the control of the Army Signal Corps until 1962 when it was taken over by the U.S. Air Force.
The Army Signal Corps (which develops, tests, provides, and manages communications and information systems support for the command and control of all the U.S. armed forces) connected military posts with each other and with the continental United States. This system of thousands of miles of suspended landlines and submarine cable included the first successful long-distance radio operation in the world. The telegraph was also the first major contribution to Alaskan infrastructure provided by the U.S. federal government, marking the beginning of the government's central role in the development of Alaska. 
At the start of the 20th century, when the United States was committing American troops to military engagements around the world, the incredible work of the Signal Corps in Alaska worked to make sure military communications could flow. An important message, such as General MacArthur's World War II demand for the surrender of the Japanese was received and automatically recorded as printed text and parallel punched holes on paper tape and could then be relayed on to other stations.
The ACS also provided a vital lifeline - sometimes quite literally - to the many remote and almost inaccessible communities across Alaska: it enabled the icebound city of Nome to alert the outside world about a diphtheria outbreak which led to the successful 1925 serum run to Nome.
History.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Alaska was a cold and inhospitable place where travel, let alone news, took a month or more to happen. In 1870, Alaska had just recently been sold to America by the Russian Empire. In the U.S.A. that year, the U.S. Army Signal Corps began to establish isolated forts (meteorological stations) throughout the Western territories. These stations were usually not much more than cold, lonely huts manned by a single telegraph operator or soldier. 
In 1900 the Congress appropriated nearly a half a million dollars for the purpose of establishing a land and underwater communications system connecting the various military posts in Alaska with the rest of the United States.
The communications system was operated by signal soldiers assigned to the depot companies at the various forts around Alaska. WAMCATS soldiers reported directly to the Chief Signal Officer of the United States Army. 
Wired telephone poles eventually were put in place in Alaska, however they were not too reliable. One of the problems was that heavy snow and ice typical in Alaska, would cause the telephone poles to fall over, breaking the connections. During the winter there might be six feet of frozen snow that could topple poles. Laying cable underwater would solve part of that problem, and would also help the military with ship to shore communications.
The first submarine telegraph cable laid by the United States Signal Corps was in the Philippines in 1899. Soon thereafter, underwater cable was first laid in Alaska in 1900, when the vessel CS Orizaba connected Unalakik to St. Michael and St. Michael to Safety Island, Cape Nome.
Between 1900 and 1905, Army soldiers of the 59th Signal Battalion (also known as the "Voice of the Arctic") constructed a telegraph line linking the U.S. Army posts across Alaska with each other, including a wireless system crossing Norton Sound on the west coast of Alaska. In 1903 an underwater cable between Sitka, Alaska and Seattle, Washington was also laid, allowing rapid communication between Alaska and the lower continental U.S. 
By 1918, the 1st Signal Service Company was activated at Valdez, Alaska and 2nd Signal Service Company at Fort Gibbon to operate WAMCATS in Alaska. The 2nd Signal Service Company was not formally inactivated until 1927. 
The vessel CS Dellwood undertook the laying of a new submarine cable in 1924 between Seattle and Alaska with a post at Ketchikan.
From 1931 the Army Signal Corps did not own a cable ship and so the system deteriorated until the beginning of World War II in 1941.
The first submarine telephone cables were laid in 1956 with CS's Albert J. Myer and Basil O. Lenoir undertaking the work. The cable came ashore at around intervals.
The ACS was eventually transferred to the Air Force in July 1962.

Scarborough is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia.
The district is a coastal electorate based in the northern suburbs of Perth and is named for the suburb of Scarborough. It also includes the suburbs of Doubleview, Innaloo, Osborne Park, and parts of the suburbs of City Beach, Karrinyup, and Trigg.
Politically, the district is a marginal one. Based on the results of the 2005 state election, the seat was created with a Liberal Party majority of 52.4% to 47.6% versus the Labor Party.
History.
Scarborough was first created at the 1972 redistribution, and was first contested at the 1974 election. Although typically a Liberal-held seat, it was won by the Labor Party at the 1983 and 1986 elections. The district was abolished at the 1996 election, largely replaced by the seat of Innaloo. Innaloo continued in the same trend as its predecessor, being won by Labor candidate John Quigley at the 2001 election before being abolished at the 2003 redistribution.
A new seat called Scarborough was created for the 2008 state election when the number of metropolitan seats was increased in accordance with the new one vote one value legislation. Scarborough was formed from the territory of two existing electorates: the southern end of Carine and the northern end of Churchlands.

Theodore C. "Ted" Weill (July 25, 1925 – November 20, 2009) was the nominee for President of the United States of the Reform Party of the United States of America in the 2008 election. He was nominated at the party's national convention on July 20, 2008 in Dallas, Texas.
During a 2009 interview with Monmouth University's school newspaper, Weill expressed interest in running again in 2012, but he died at his home on November 20, 2009.
Early life.
Weill, a graduate of Michigan State University, was also a decorated World War II veteran, who earned four Battle Stars and served aboard the . He was also a Boy Scout instructor. He was invited to the White House Conference on Small Business three times; in 1980, 1985, and 1990.
Political background.
In the 1990s, Weill founded the Independent Party of Mississippi. In 1997, the Independent Party of Mississippi became the official state affiliate of the national Reform Party and renamed itself the Mississippi Reform Party.
Weill was the chairman of the Mississippi Reform Party and a Reform Party National Committeeman.
In 1996, Weill ran for a United States Senate seat from Mississippi finishing third with 2% of the vote (13,600 votes).
In 2000, Weill endorsed Natural Law Party candidate John Hagelin instead of Pat Buchanan.
In 2004, Weill campaigned for the Reform Party's 2004 presidential nomination, but withdrew his candidacy after Ralph Nader announced his intention to seek the party's nomination. Weill ultimately endorsed Nader and contributed thousands of dollars to his political campaigns. 
During his acceptance speech at the 2004 Reform Party National Convention in 
Irving, Texas, Ralph Nader thanked Weill for his support.
2008 presidential campaign.
At the Reform Party's 2008 national convention, Frank McEnulty of California, the 2008 presidential candidate of the New American Independent Party, was nominated to be Weill's vice-presidential running-mate. However, the party could not announce the results of the national convention on its web site until October, due to a court order obtained by another faction of the party. The rebel faction also prevented Weill from appearing on the ballot in any of the states in which the party retained access, excluding Mississippi. 
Therefore, the Weill/McEnulty ticket appeared on the ballot in only Mississippi and received only 470 votes in that state. He also received write-in votes in Alabama.
Legacy.
Weill died in November 2009. His former running-mate, Frank McEnulty, stated:
"Ted truly believed in trying to do what was best for the country and it is what had driven him to spend so much time, money and effort on his campaign and in support of the Reform Party."

Runic Games

Runic Games is a Seattle-based American computer game company formed by Travis Baldree (creator of "Fate"), Max Schaefer and Erich Schaefer (co-founders of Blizzard North, of Diablo fame), Peter Hu, and the Flagship Studios Seattle team responsible for "Mythos". It is a subsidiary of Perfect World Co., Ltd. In 2009, the company released "Torchlight", a single-player action role-playing game. They released a sequel, "Torchlight II", on September 20th, 2012. It was at this time the developers revealed they were no longer pursuing plans to create an MMO in the "Torchlight" universe.
History.
Runic Games was founded in August 2008 by Travis Baldree, Max Schaefer, Erich Schaefer and Peter Hu. The company formed specifically for the purpose of keeping the "Mythos" team together to develop a new action RPG video game as a "spiritual successor" to their previous project. Following the dissolution of Flagship Studios in 2008, all 14 members of the Seattle team that developed "Mythos" signed onto Runic Games.
Full production on the game started around November 2008, meaning that the game's total development period was approximately 11 months. At the 2009 Game Developers Conference some members of the Runic Games team were present with an early version of their single-player game, at which point it was revealed that the title would be "Torchlight". One notable addition to the staff was Matt Uelmen, composer for Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo series. As of mid-2009, the company employed no fewer than 26 people.
Gamasutra named Runic Games one of its "Top 5 Developers" of 2009 for the studio's ability to create the "highly-polished" "Torchlight" in only 11 months. The company was also praised for its responsiveness to its player community, citing one particular incident:
Following the 2009 release of "Torchlight", the studio shifted to the production of a sequel "Torchlight II". 
In 2010, Perfect World Entertainment, Inc. bought an $8.4 million majority stake in Runic Games.

"Torchlight" (2009).
Runic Games' first product is "Torchlight", a single-player action role-playing game published by Perfect World Entertainment, Inc. and Encore, Inc, and released for Windows on October 27, 2009. The fantasy-themed game is set in the fictional town of Torchlight and the expansive caverns and dungeons nearby, which adventurers explore to collect valuable loot and battle hordes of monsters. Following the initial digital distribution release, Encore, Inc published a Windows retail box version in January 2010, a port for Mac OS X was developed by World Domination Industries and released through Steam in May 2010, and it was released for the Xbox 360 via XBLA on March 9, 2011. The game was met with a generally positive critical reception, holding a Metacritic score of 83 based on 57 reviews.
"Torchlight II" (2012).
Runic Games announced "Torchlight II", a sequel that features multiplayer co-op. The company decided to develop the sequel to "give players what they're asking for" in terms of a multiplayer experience, while serving as an intermediate step toward their planned MMORPG. Torchlight II was released on September 20, 2012.
Though not listed anywhere in their marketing materials, Torchlight II requires a Runic Games account to play in Internet Multiplayer games.

Henry the Middle, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg

Henry the Middle, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1468–19 February 1532) was Prince of Lüneburg from 1486 to 1520.
Life.
Henry of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the son of Otto V of Lüneburg and Anna of Nassau, was born in 1468. In 1486, Henry took control of Lüneburg from his mother, who had been regent since the death of Henry’s grandfather, Frederick II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Henry’s reign was marked by the complications relating to the Hildesheim Prince-Bishopric Feud. Henry was on the side of the bishop, and was against the nobility of Hildesheim and the Welfs of Brunswick. In 1519, Henry was victorious in the Battle of Soltau, though the intervention of the newly elected Emperor Charles V transformed the victory achieved on the battlefield into a defeat. Henry was on the side of the French during the election, and so earned the enmity of Charles V. Henry’s two eldest sons became regents of the country, and Henry went into exile at the French king’s court. Henry returned in 1527 during the beginning of the Reformation in Lüneberg, and tried to regain control of the land with help from those opposed to the Reformation. His attempt failed, and Henry returned to France, only to return in 1530. He spent his last days in the princely house in Lüneberg, which had been given to him by his eldest son. After the death of his first wife, Margaret of Saxony, Henry married, unequally, Anna von Campe. He was buried in the abbey of Wienhausen. Today, his gravestone can still be seen.

The Institut des molécules et de la matière condensée de Lille - IMMCL Chevreul ( Institute for molecules and condensed matter in Lille) is a physics and chemistry research institute. It is a member of the Université Lille Nord de France.
Background history.
Academic researches in chemistry in Lille started in the early days of the 19th century, with Charles Frédéric Kuhlmann's innovations on sulfuric acid production and researches on using platinum catalysis for industrial production of nitric acid from ammonia (from 1823 to 1833).
The faculty of sciences of Lille was however formally established in 1854 only, with a chemist as its first dean (Louis Pasteur). Hence, academic and applied researches in chemistry, catalysis, and later molecular physics, were boosted from the 19th century onwards and further developed in the 20th and 21st centuries, both in fundamental research and applied research thanks to industry applications.
Research labs.
IMMCL research laboratories are accredited as French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) laboratories.
The different laboratories of the institute include :

<doc id="18831839" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18831839" title="Sichuan takin">
Sichuan takin

The Sichuan takin or Tibetan takin ("Budorcas taxicolor tibetana") is a subspecies of takin (goat-antelope). Budorcas from Greek bous ("ox" or "cow") and dorkas ("gazelle"); taxicolor from Latin taxus ("badger") and color ("hue") referring to badger-like coloration Listed as a vulnerable species, the Sichuan takin is native to Tibet and the provinces of Sichuan, Gansu and Xinjiang in the People's Republic of China.
Taxonomy.
It can be differentiated from its close cousin, the golden takin, largely by its coat color among other morphological differences, in addition to a different range of habitat. The takin used to be considered closely related to the Arctic muskox. Physical similarities have now been found to be due to convergent evolution and not through a common ancestor. DNA sequencing recently revealed various sheep are close relatives (goats, tahrs, sheep, bharal, Barbary sheep).
Habitat.
Takin inhabit the same dense bamboo forests as the better known giant panda. Sichuan takins live in these dense thickets and bamboo groves, in family groups of up to 30 individuals. 
Despite being large, stocky and relatively slow moving, the Sichuan takin is quite agile in maneuvering its rocky habitat with often steep and challenging slopes. The inaccessibility of the takin’s mountainous habitat has meant that there is little information on this species’ behavior and ecology; specifically on their distribution and population size. 
Species Threats.
Although considered a national treasure of China with the highest legal protection, the Sichuan takin is threatened by ongoing poaching and habitat destruction. The highest need for this species is further scientific knowledge to allow production of a valid long-term conservation and management plan. The principal threats to its survival include poaching by hunters for food and fur. This has led to their decline in the wild. A reliable count of the species has not been fully undertaken, but it may have indirectly benefited from the protections accorded to the giant panda and other species. 
Behavior and Ecology.
Takins have adaptations that help them stay warm and dry during the bitter cold of winter in the Himalayan Mountains. A thick, secondary coat is grown to keep out the chill. The large, moose-like snout has large sinus cavities to warm up the air a takin inhales before it gets to the lungs. Without this adaptation, takins would lose a large amount of body heat just by breathing. Yet another protection is their oily skin. Although they have no skin glands, their skin secretes an oily, bitter-tasting substance that acts as a natural raincoat in storms and fog. Streaks of this oily stuff can be seen where takins rub. They also have an odor that smells like a strange combination of horse and musk.
Takins eat in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, and they rest when they are not feeding. Since they live at altitudes above 14,000 feet (4,300 meters), they feed on many kinds of alpine and deciduous plants and evergreens. When it comes to food, takins eat almost any vegetation within reach. This includes the tough leaves of evergreen rhododendrons and oaks, willow and pine bark, bamboo leaves, and a variety of new-growth leaves and herbs. They can easily stand on their hind legs, front legs propped against a tree, to reach for higher vegetation if they need to.
Herding and Migration.
Each spring, takins gather in large herds and migrate up the mountains to the tree line. As cooler weather approaches and food becomes scarce, the takins move down to forested valleys. As they move up, down, or across the mountains, takins use the same routes over and over. This creates a series of well-worn paths through the dense growths of bamboo and rhododendrons that lead to their natural salt licks and grazing areas.
The size of a takin herd changes with the seasons: during spring and early summer, herds can number up to 300 animals; during cooler months, when food is less plentiful, the large herds break up into smaller groups of 10 to 35 takins as they head down the mountain. Herds are made up of adult females (called cows), kids (which is what takin young are called), subadults, and young males. Older males, called bulls, are generally solitary except during the "rut," or mating season, in late summer.
Reproduction.
The cows give birth to a single kid in early spring.Within three days of its birth, a takin kid is able to follow its mother through most types of terrain. This is very important if predators are nearby or if the herd needs to travel a long distance for food.
Natural Enemies.
Because of their large, powerful bodies and impressive horns, takins have few natural enemies other than bears or wolves. They are generally slow moving but can react quickly if angered or frightened. When needed, a takin can leap nimbly from rock to rock. If a takin senses danger, it warns the others with a loud "cough" that sends the herd running for cover. Takins can also make an intimidating roar or bellow.

Bhutan takin

The Bhutan Takin ("Budorcas taxicolor whitei") is a vulnerable subspecies of Takin native to Bhutan, North Eastern India, Western part of China, and Tibet. The main threats to the Bhutan Takin are hunting and habitat loss.
Range, behavior, and habitat.
In Bhutan, Takin are found in bamboo forests at altitudes of , where they eat grass, buds and leaves. Takin are diurnal, active in the day, resting in the heat on particularly sunny days. Takin gather in small herds in winter and herds of up to a hundred individuals in the summer; in winter, they move to lower elevations and split into smaller herds of 10-50 individuals, mostly in the Gasa District. As is often seen in bison, old males are often solitary.
A study of the Bhutan Takin's seasonal movement and habitat use has been conducted by Jigme Dorji National Park staff which is thought to be the stronghold of the species in Bhutan. An earlier study of its diet on its summer range showed that the takin is a generalist browser foraging on numerous shrubs and forbs.
In China, the species is known to inhabit from south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River on the southern-facing side of the eastern Himalayas, to the westerly bend of the river. In India it occurs in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim.
In captivity.
Several Takin are kept captive in the Motithang Takin Preserve in Thimphu, where they can be hand-fed by tourists and are obese as a result. His Majesty the Fourth King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, ordered the captive Takin released in the 1980s but after they wandered the streets of Thimphu for several weeks, they were recaptured and placed back into captivity.

220th Military Police Brigade

The 220th Military Police Brigade is a military police brigade of the United States Army, headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It is an Active Component/Reserve Component formation of the U.S. Army Reserve.
First activated in 1959, the brigade was a part of the reserves for the first 40 years of its existence, and never participated in any conflicts or wars of the 20th century. Its headquarters moved around several places until coming to Gaithersburg in 1970, where it has remained ever since. The brigade was activated into the active duty force for one year from early 2003 until early 2004 to participate in the initial invasion and occupation of Iraq, Operation Iraqi Freedom. After this deployment, the brigade was again placed in reserve and has since commanded units in readiness exercises for other large U.S. combat formations preparing to deploy in support of U.S. operations worldwide.
Organization.
The 220th Military Police Brigade is headquartered at the Major General Benjamin L. Hunton Memorial United States Army Reserve Center at 8791 Snouffer School Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland, which also serves as the headquarters of the U.S. Army Reserve Legal Command. 
As a reserve unit, the formation is not in existence on a permanent basis, but is instead only called upon when needed. The brigade's Headquarters and Headquarters Company is located in Gaithersburg, and it commands two other reserve military police battalions. These are the 336th Military Police Battalion and the 400th Military Police Battalion. The brigade commands numerous smaller company sized reserve military police units throughout the country. These units deploy to foreign theaters of operations with the brigade when it is called upon, and they also deploy to various installations throughout the United States when needed for participation in training and readiness exercises.
History.
The unit was first constituted on 3 April 1959 in the Army Reserve as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 220th Military Police Group before being activated on 25 May of that year in Washington, D. C.. On 23 July 1960, the location of the group's headquarters was changed to Rockville, Maryland. The group remained in the reserves throughout the Vietnam War, and was never called upon to serve in the Vietnam theater of operations, as active duty military police groups were already being organized in the theater and additional, reserve commands were not needed. As such, the group received no campaign participation credit for the conflict.
Ten years later, on 17 April 1970, the location of the group headquarters was again changed to Gaithersburg, Maryland where it is presently located. It received a shoulder sleeve insignia on 24 July 1972 and a distinctive unit insignia on 27 September 1972. 
The group was reorganized and redesignated on 10 December 1971 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 220th Military Police Brigade, allowing it to command a larger number of military police units. On 16 April 1980 the brigade's command element was again reorganized as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 220th Military Police Brigade. Prior to the Iraq War, the brigade remained on reserve status, prepared to deploy if needed, but it was never called upon for any contingency operations or conflicts, as other active duty military police commands, primarily the 16th Military Police Brigade, were called upon to be deployed instead. By 1999, after 40 years of existence, the brigade had yet to be deployed to a foreign theater of operations or participate in any conflicts or contingencies.
The brigade saw only a single activation into active duty service, at the start of the Iraq War. It was ordered into active military service on 10 February 2003 at Gaithersburg, Maryland as part of the U.S. Military's mobilization in preparation for Operation Iraqi Freedom. Some 13,800 reserve component Military Police were called into active duty for the invasion, including the Headquarters of the 220th as well as the 800th Military Police Brigade. Overall, over 57,000 reserve and national guard troops were called into active duty service for the invasion. The brigade assumed command of other reserve and national guard military police units during the operation, including company sized units from Virginia, New York, Illinois, Kansas and Texas The brigade was, in turn, subordinate to the 377th Theater Support Command. During its tour, the Brigade suffered five casualties; three soldiers killed in combat, and two soldiers killed in vehicle accidents. The brigade served in Iraq for a year before returning to the United States in early 2004. It was relieved from active military service on 21 April 2004 and reverted to reserve status once again. The brigade is an "AC/RC" (Active Component / Reserve Component) formation. 
Since 2005, the brigade has provided detachment and company sized units to active duty combat brigades for use in exercises at the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana. These exercises were highly varied in nature, and primarily aimed at training those units for future deployment to Iraq. One such unit was the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, which the brigade provided several company sized units to during their training exercises.
Honors.
Unit decorations.
The brigade has never received a unit decoration from the United States military.

George Washington Memorial Park (Jackson, Wyoming)

George Washington Memorial Park is located at the center of Jackson, Wyoming. More generally known as "Town Square", the park is notable for its elk-antler arches at each corner of the park, collected from the nearby National Elk Refuge by Boy Scouts and periodically rebuilt. The square originally existed as an open space in the center of town that was made into a park in 1934. The park center also contains a stone memorial to John Colter.
The Town Square originated as an open space in the middle of Jackson where no buildings had yet been built, surrounded by more developed blocks in the sparsely-settled street grid of the town. The area was used as a commons area by people and occasionally as a thoroughfare for migrating elk. In 1917 the town graded the surrounding street and obtained title to most of the land, using excess material from the grading to even out depressions in the square's surface. In 1924 the town undertook further improvements to the area, now called "the little park in the center of the town." The initiative yielded further grading. A few trees were planted, and were then indifferently maintained.
With the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of George Washington approaching in 1932, the state of Wyoming cooperated with Congress to prepare memorials throughout the state. The Wyoming plan was to establish a George Washington Memorial Park in as many communities as possible. The Town Square was designated the George Washington Memorial Park for Jackson in 1932. The organizing committee, which included Olaus Murie raised the requisite $150 in public donations to landscape the park. Plantings were not ready until 1933. However, labor shortages remained a problem, and little work was accomplished. Jackson applied for and received $3092 from the New Deal Civil Works Administration, which allowed the town to organize a land transfer allowing the sole building on the square property, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Hall, to move to another site. Altogether, more than $6000 in CWA funds were expended, just before the CWA was closed down in 1934.
In short order the Square became the center of Jackson's civic life. A memorial to John Colter was placed in the center of the park in 1939. In 1953 the local Rotary Club built an arch of elk antlers at the southwest corner of the park. Arches were erected at the remaining corners in 1966, 1967 and 1969.
In 1959 a house originally built by Charles Wort was moved onto the square, becoming known as the "Stage Stop." The move was unpopular and possibly illegal, but the building remained until 1995 when it was given the Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, whose grandfather had used the building as a law office. A modern replacement was built in its stead. It was not until 1976 that a plaque was placed in the park for the United States Bicentennial naming the park "George Washington Memorial Park." Stone facings were added to the antler arches the same year.

Bezoar ibex

The bezoar ibex ("Capra hircus aegagrus") is a vulnerable subspecies of wild goat, native to Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iraq, Iran, Russia and Turkey. It has been extirpated from Lebanon. They were also introduced to the Florida Mountains of New Mexico. The bezoar goat is found in the mountains of Asia Minor and across the Middle East. It is also found on some Aegean Islands and in Crete where it is accepted that the goats constitute relict populations of very early domestic animals that were taken to the Mediterranean islands during the prehistoric period and now live as feral populations. The bezoar goat, if not the sole progenitor of the modern domestic goat, was at least its main progenitor.
The archaeological evidence traces goat domestication as far back as ca. 10,500 year Before Present and DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years BP.

In 2004, Kovalenko was appointed as Director of the Second Department of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was appointed as Ambassador of Russia to Georgia on 11 July 2006. On August 29, 2008, Georgia ordered all Russian diplomats to leave the country. Kovalenko left Tbilisi on 30 September with 22 Russian diplomats on an airplane to Moscow.
Kovalenko speaks Russian, Arabic, Belarusian and French.
September 2007 controversy.
On September 24, 2007, the former Russian ambassador to Georgia, Vyacheslav Kovalenko, became embroiled in a controversy over his statement at a televised informal meeting with Georgian intellectuals organized by the Tbilisi-based Russian-Georgian Friendship Union in which he referred to the Georgian people as a "dying-out nation", and announced to the Georgians that they will soon become extinct in the face of globalization while Russia is "a large country, a huge country. It can digest this. You, the Georgians, will fail to digest this."
The statements sparked public outrage in Georgia, and Kovalenko was summoned by Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for explanations while the opposition factions in the Parliament of Georgia demanded the withdrawal of Kovalenko from Georgia. Georgian Parliamentary Chairperson, Nino Burjanadze, responded to the ambassador’s prediction: "Maybe, certain forces in Russia really want to see the extinction of Georgian nation, but this will not happen… I would advise Mr. Kovalenko to think about Russia and its demographic problems and we will ourselves take care of Georgian problems, including the demographic ones."

Avro 533 Manchester

The Avro 533 Manchester was a First World War-era twin-engine biplane photo-reconnaissance and bomber aircraft designed and manufactured by Avro.
Design and development.
Designed as a twin-engine bomber and photo-reconnaissance aircraft, the Avro 533 was a development of the earlier 523 and 529A. Originally designated as the Avro 529B, the new 320 hp (240 kW) ABC Dragonfly I nine-cylinder engine was specified, but with a redesign in July 1918, the type number was subsequently changed to Avro 533. When the original engines were not available, the 300 hp (220 kW) Siddeley Puma engine was substituted on the second prototype in November 1918, this acquiring a new designation, the Avro 533A Manchester Mk II, and first flying in December that year. An American 400 hp (300 kW) Liberty engine was also proposed as an alternate engine.
Operational history.
The Avro 533A Manchester Mk II flew for the first time in December 1918 with flight testing continuing with No. 186 Development Squadron. By March 1919, Avro sent the first prototype to Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham Heath for official trials before its eventual return to the Avro factory at Hamble. The aircraft was a large, and mainly conventional design of wooden and fabric construction typical of the time. Open cockpits were retained, although later modifications were planned for passenger compartments in the interior.
In December 1919, the second prototype received its Dragonfly I engines, becoming the Avro 533A Manchester Mk I. Other than the different engines, there were few differences between the two types, other than the Mk I having a slightly reduced lower wing surface, and enlarged tail fin and rudder to correct control problems indicated in testing. Flight testing also indicated a lower performance than anticipated which resulted in Avro reconsidering the type's further trials, and eventually led to the abandoning of the third prototype, which was never fitted with engines.
In March 1919, Avro proposed a passenger airliner, the Avro 537 that would be adapted from the earlier bomber version. The plans were ultimately abandoned and all the Type 533 prototypes were scrapped.

Sindh ibex

The Sindh ibex or Turkman wild goat ("Capra aegagrus blythi") is a vulnerable species of wild goat commonly native to southern Pakistan.
Description.
Sindh ibex are rather stocky animals with thick-set bodies and strong limbs terminating in broad hooves. Female and young males, till their second winter, are yellowish-brown varying to reddish-grey with a darker brown mid-dorsal line extending from between the shoulders to the base of the tail. Mature males are spectacularly beautiful, with long sweeping scimitar shaped horns over 102 cm (40 in) in length and almost silver white bodies offset by a sooty grey chest, throat and face. The extent of white hairs in the hind neck and body region of males increases with age. The hair in summer coat is short and coarse and even in adult males is more reddish-buff in colour. Males have short beards, but females lack any beard. The belly and outside of the lower limbs, beard and forepart of the face vary from black to deep chestnut-brown in mature males. There is also a conspicuous black stripe in adult males, running from the withers down the front of the shoulders and merging with the black chest. Older males have a dark face pattern. The horns are strongly keeled in front, sweeping upwards and outwards with the tips generally diverging. The population estimate of Sindh ibex in kirthar national park is around 13,000.
Natural history.
This wild goat is gregarious, and if undisturbed will congregate in fairly large herds. The older male associate with such herds but generally keep together, often on the periphery of the main band. Where disturbed, they are much more wary and ascend into inaccessible crags very early in the morning, emerging again just before dusk. During the hottest part of the year, they lie up more extensively during the day and may graze a considerable part of the night. Wild goats have a wonderful sense of balance and can make a standing leap 1.75 m (5–6 ft) upwards on a seemingly vertical rock surface. They appear almost slow and deliberate when traversing rock faces but can slide without injury down almost perpendicular rock faces with drops as much as 4–6 m. When challenging another male these wild goats frequently stand up on their hind legs and at the same time bend their head to one side before charging forward and clashing their horns.

Warrant sale

A warrant sale was a statutory means of collecting debts in Scotland until 2001. Legal procedure for warrant sales was governed by the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987. The practice was controversial, those who opposed it were concerned that it affected the poorest section of society who genuinely were unable to pay a debt, others claimed the legislation was needed to ensure people paid their debts.
It became a contentious political issue in the late 1980s, when Scottish councils used the legislation against an ever-increasing number of Community Charge defaulters. This involved councils applying for a warrant from the local court to collect the money owed by non-payers. Sheriff officers (private companies, even though their title suggests they are court employees) were the choice of the local authorities to collect the outstanding debts. Under the 1987 act, the debt collectors were permitted to enter a debtor's home and poind (put a value on) items, which would be subject to a later, public, sale under warrant (warrant sale).
The practice was abolished when Tommy Sheridan, MSP, of the Scottish Socialist Party, introduced a private member's bill in 2001, and the Scottish Parliament voted to remove the legislation from Scots law under the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001.

Bodmin manumissions

The Bodmin manumissions or Bodmin Gospels is a manuscript containing writing in Latin, Saxon and Cornish which is thus of interest to language scholars.
Recorded in the Old Cornish language, in the margins of a book of the Gospels, are the names and details of slaves freed in Bodmin (the then principal town of Cornwall, an important religious centre) during the 9th or 10th centuries. There is also an Old Cornish Vocabulary, an English – Latin vocabulary from around AD 1000 to which was added about a century later a Cornish translation. Some 961 Cornish words are recorded, ranging from celestial bodies, through church and craft occupations, to plants and animals.
This, it is believed, is the only original record relating to Cornwall, or its Bishopric, which predates the Norman Conquest. The volume is in quarto, of rather an oblong form, and is very neatly written, though evidently by a scribe not well informed, or of great learning, even for those times. The entries seem to be contemporaneous with the manumissions which they record. The practice of manumitting slaves in the church, as recorded in the entries, appears to have existed from the early 4th century.

Old Administrative Area Historic District

The Old Administrative Area Historic District, also known as Beaver Creek, is the former headquarters area of Grand Teton National Park. The complex of five houses, three warehouses and an administrative building were designed in the National Park Service rustic style between 1934 and 1939 and were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Public Works Administration. As part of the Mission 66 program, the park headquarters were relocated to Moose, Wyoming in the 1960s.
The site was planned by Keith Matson of the National Park Service. The houses are oriented so that they enjoy a view of Grand Teton from their front porches. The interiors of the buildings have been substantially remodeled over time to accommodate changing tastes, expectations and functions and are not considered historically significant, while the exteriors remain well preserved and substantially unaltered.
The buildings include the park superintendent's house, five houses with garages, the old park administration building, and three warehouses.
The location was the site of the Stewart Ranger Station, which was expanded to become the park headquarters.
The Beaver Creek district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1990.

Electoral district of Innaloo

Innaloo was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia from 1996 to 2005 that had 24,311 electors on roll.
The district was based in the northern suburbs of Perth, and named for the suburb of Innaloo. It also included all or parts of the suburbs of Balcatta, Doubleview, Gwelup, Karrinyup, Osborne Park, Scarborough, Stirling and Trigg.
History.
Innaloo was created in the 1994 redistribution, essentially replacing the abolished seat of Scarborough and incorporating part of the former Glendalough, and was first contested at the 1996 state election. Hence, Innaloo was contested, and won, by incumbent Scarborough MP George Strickland. 
Innaloo, as with Scarborough before it, was a seat generally seen as a Liberal seat, but winnable by Labor at elections where Labor received well over 50% of the overall two-party preferred votes. This occurred in 1983 and 1986, and again in 2001.
Innaloo was abolished just two terms after its creation, taking effect at the 2005 election. Its territory was divided between the existing seats of Carine and Churchlands, and the new seat of Balcatta. Sitting MP John Quigley opted to contest the new seat of Mindarie in the outer northern suburbs of Perth.

Khetagurovo

Khetagurovo (, "khet’agurovi"; ) is a 150-house village in South Ossetia, "de facto" independent partially recognized republic in the South Caucasus, formerly the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. The village has been controlled by the South Ossetian forces since the armed clashes with the Georgian troops in 1991/1992.
2008 South Ossetia War.
Khetagurovo is situated 5 kilometers west of Tskhinvali, capital of South Ossetia. On the west and south, it borders 3 Georgian villages Nuli, Avnevi and Didmuha. As can be seen on satellite images, Khetagorovo had four Ossetian defense positions outside the village in the south and southwest in direct 1-2 kilometer sight of Georgian defense positions at Avnevi and Didmuha. The strategic importance of Khetagorogo was due to its position at the road connecting Georgian-controlled parts of south-western South Ossetia with Tskhinvali and giving access (2 kilometers north-east) to the only Ossetian-controlled road that connected Tskhinvali with Russia through South Ossetian town of Java.
During the 2008 Battle for Tskhinvali, the village was assaulted, on the night from 7 to 8 of August, by the Georgian government troops. The Georgian side accused the Ossetian militias of using the village as their base for shelling of the nearby villages earlier in August 2008 while South Ossetians claimed that Georgians had been shelling Khetagurovo from Avnevi"
According to the then-de facto South Ossetian prime-minister Yuri Morozov, Khetagurovo was badly damaged by Georgian troops. According to the Regnum News Agency, villagers said "Georgian forces burned down a church while terrified civilians perished inside". The report also said "Georgian soldiers kidnapped, raped and tortured young girls of Khetagurovo, Georgian tanks ran people down". A journalist of Reuters claimed that on August 8, Georgian troops killed eight people and badly damaged the village.
The Georgian government admitted that Khetagurovo was the "only village that sustained severe damage due to the location of substantial amounts of military equipment and forces around the village", but rejected claims about cruel or degrading treatment of the civilian population after the Georgian forces' seizure of the area.
The Human Rights Watch (HRW) fact-finding mission reported the "indiscriminate fire" by the Georgian troops and shelling of the village by multiple-launch rocket system "Grad" and tanks. According to HRW, at least four civilians died as a result of Georgian attack. But none of the villagers interviewed by it "complained about cruel or degrading treatment by Georgian servicemen, who searched the houses looking for remaining militias and arms."

Hugh McFarland

Hugh McFarland (born 1950, Carlisle, Cumbria, UK) is the author of the controversial work 'Freemasonry Inside Out'.
Although listed as an 'anti-Mason' on the authoritative Masonicinfo that he is not actually anti-masonic in the usual sense of the word but has rather undertaken a sociological and psychological study of Freemasonry based on his personal observations of over 20 years membership, academic background in behavioral sciences and knowledge of hypnosis gained from a tutor of Paul McKenna.
He claims his initial motivation was not to reveal any of the so-called secrets or to criticize individual masons but to understand why, after leaving Freemasonry following a near-fatal accident, the Masonic Oath still had such a hold on him. As the Oath forbade writing about the ritual, putting pen to paper helped break its spell. In reflecting on his previous membership and following new avenues of research, he became concerned that the ritual cleverly concealed aspects of manipulation and conditioning and that it was masons themselves that were the victims and not the unsuspecting general public as is commonly believed.
Initially he published his observations in an eBook called "Hoodwinked - How I Slipped the Freemason's Grip" which received mainly negative comments from contributors to the newsgroup 'alt.freemasonry'.
McFarland claims that criticism of his position on Freemasonry is not related to what he has written but are mainly personal attacks for writing a free guide for other eBook authors on the benefits of using the US library system as a way of promoting their work - see article.
In 2007, together with John Hamill, Curator and Librarian of the Grand Lodge of England, and others, he featured on a DVD called 'Freemasons: Behind the Craft' - see review on IMDB. Following the success of the DVD, it is anticipated that a hard copy print version of 'Freemasonry Inside Out' will be published soon.

Craig McAllister

Craig McAllister (born 28 June 1980 in Glasgow) is a Scottish footballer who plays for Conference South club Eastleigh as a striker. 
McAllister started his career with Eastleigh as a youth player. He moved to Basingstoke Town towards the end of 2001–02, making his debut in March 2002. McAllister spent three seasons there, making 112 appearances, scoring 66 goals before moving up the national league system to Conference National club Stevenage Borough where he made six appearances, having loan spells at Eastleigh in 2004 and Gravesend & Northfleet in 2004–05. He joined Woking in 2005, spending two full seasons there, and making over 100 appearances. He had a short spell with Grays Athletic, being sent out on loan to Rushden & Diamonds and then another short spell at Oxford United, all during the 2007–08 season. After leaving Oxford in 2008, he took a step up to the Football League for the first time in his career, signing for Exeter City. He went on to score seven goals in his first season, but was loaned out to Barnet and Rotherham United in his second and was eventually released by the club in May 2010. McAllister then dropped back down to non-League football, joining Crawley Town where he played at Old Trafford; his team was defeated 1–0 by Manchester United in their FA Cup fifth round tie. He rejected a new contract from Crawley at the end of the 2010–11 season, subsequently joining Newport County.
McAllister won his first major honour in 2011, helping Crawley Town win the Conference Premier for the first time in their history.
Career.
Non-League.
Born in Glasgow, McAllister started his career in non-League football at Eastleigh in 2001. He later moved to Basingstoke Town. He made his debut in March 2002, scoring in a 1–1 draw with Hampton & Richmond Borough. He played ten games in the 2001–02 season, scoring three goals. He started the 2002–03 season with a goal on the opening day, as Basingstoke drew 2–2 with Aylesbury United. In November, McAllister scored two hat-tricks in two games, the first of which helped Basingstoke to a 3–1 win over Bishops Stortford, and the second helped his side to a 3–0 win over Braintree Town. He finished 2002–03 with 35 goals from 47 games. McAllister's success continued into 2003–04, where he scored another 28 goals in 35 appearances. This success earned him a trial with Queens Park Rangers in the Football League Championship, just one level down from the Premier League. 
After scoring 66 times in 112 games for Basingstoke Town, he moved to the Conference National outfit Stevenage on a bosman transfer in May 2004. He made his debut for Stevenage as a substitute, as they beat Crawley Town, 1–0. After struggling to get in the starting line-up for Stevenage, he was sent out on loan to his former club, Eastleigh, where he scored six goals in four games. In December 2004, he was loaned out for the second time in that season, moving to Gravesend & Northfleet, where he made debut in a 1–0 defeat by Hereford United. In the second minute of Gravesend's 1–1 draw with Crawley Town, he scored the first goal of this loan. He scored his second and last goal of this loan just two days later, which helped his team to a 2–2 draw with Accrington Stanley, before he returned to his parent club, Stevenage, in January 2005. At the end of 2004–05, he left Stevenage having only played 11 games in all competitions, with one goal. 
Before the start of 2005–06 he signed for Woking on a permanent deal. He made his debut in August 2005, starting in a 2–1 defeat by Kidderminster Harriers. McAllister finished his debut season with thirteen goals, eight of which were in the league. McAllister scored his first brace for Woking in September 2006, as he helped his side to overcome Forest Green Rovers, 3–2, away from home. After scoring 18 goals in 2006–07, he attracted interest from several Conference sides and in May 2007 he signed for Grays Athletic. After making his debut for Grays Athletic in a 0–0 draw with Torquay United in August 2007, he played only another eight times, scoring one goal against Droylsden, before being sent out on loan to league rivals Rushden & Diamonds in October. He returned from the loan in January 2008, having only scored one goal, against Oxford United, who he then signed for on his return to Grays. Having joined Oxford on a contract until the end of the 2007–08 season, McAllister made his debut for the club in a 4–0 win over Altrincham; he scored 22 minutes into the game. He made another 16 appearances, scoring one more goal, before leaving at the end of the season.
Exeter City.
He completed a move to Football League Two side Exeter City in summer 2008, signing for the first time for a club in the Football League. He made his first team debut in August 2008, in a home match against Southampton, in the League Cup. Exeter lost the game 3–1. It took until December for McAllister to score his first competitive for the club, when he scored to help Exeter to a 2–1 win over Lincoln City. He then scored another two goals later that month, in a 4–1 win over north-west club Rochdale. He added just another two goals to his tally in January 2009, both in Exeter's 2–1 win over Dagenham & Redbridge. The remainder of the 2008–09 season saw him only add two more goals, against Macclesfield Town and Darlington, both in the space of a month. After only making five appearances for Exeter in 2009–10, he joined Barnet on loan in November 2009. McAllister, still without a goal in 2009–10, couldn't get on the scoresheet in the three games he played for Barnet, and he returned to Exeter in January. In March, still having not played for Exeter since his return from Barnet, he signed an emergency one-month loan deal at Rotherham United. He made his debut for Rotherham in their 1–0 away win over Dagenham & Redbridge. After another seven games and still no goals, he returned to Exeter only to be released in May, along with eight other team-mates.
Return to non-League.
Following his release from Exeter City, McAllister moved back to non-League, signing for Conference Premier outfit Crawley Town on a one-year contract, in June 2008. He made his debut in August, when his side lost 1–0 to Grimsby Town. Ten days later he scored his first goal in a Crawley shirt, scoring the second in a 2–1 win over newly promoted Bath City. Just four days later, he scored two goals as Crawley beat Hayes & Yeading United, 3–0, away from home. In February 2011, McAllister started in Crawley Town's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Manchester United at Old Trafford, which Crawley 1–0. At the end of the 2010–11 season, after Crawley gained promotion to the Football League, McAllister was released after he rejected a new deal.
McAllister signed for Newport County in May 2011, deciding to stay in non-League football. He signed for Newport after their manager, Anthony Hudson, had earlier stated, "We are on the verge of two massive additions to the squad, who will take the club in the direction that we want to go."
After failing to find the net in 26 games for Newport County he joined Conference rivals Luton Town on loan until the end of the 2011-12 season. He scored his first goal in over a year against Ebbsfleet United on 17 April 2012. In June 2012 McAllister rejoined Eastleigh.
Style of play.
McAllister plays as a striker, he is "an explosive front man", and is described as a "targetman" because of his height. His time at Basingstoke Town was described as "prolific" due to the number of goals he scored. While at Exeter City, manager Paul Tisdale described him as "excellent", and said that McAllister and fellow Exeter City striker Richard Logan had a good partnership together after McAllister scored a hat-trick for the reserve team.
On signing for Luton Town manager Gary Brabin described McAllister as "adaptable in any role...he works hard, he's strong and he chips in with his fair share of goals."
Personal life.
After his move to Oxford United in January 2008, he stated that the reason for the move was so that he could be closer to his family home in Southampton. On his arrival at Exeter City in July 2008, he moved into a house with fellow Exeter forward, Ben Watson. McAllister stated that it would make a huge difference living near the training ground, instead of travelling long distances to get to training and matches.

Clara van Spaerwoude

Clara Jansdochter van Spaerwoude (sometimes written Sparwoude) (ca. 1530 – 4 August 1615) was a Dutch noblewoman of Delft who is chiefly remembered for her great wealth and various charitable funds from her estate. The most famous of these granted a sum of money to each of her relatives and their descendants upon their marriage, and was in continuous operation until 1922, when the monies were liquidated by the Dutch government.
Life and legacy.
Clara was the daughter of Jan Heyndrixzn. (1477–1552) a goldsmith of Delft, and his second wife Willemtgen Willemsdr (1495–1564). In 1556 she married Arent Vranckenzn. van der Meer (died 1596), a high-ranking city official and burgemeester in Delft. Following her death on 4 August 1615, she was interred on 8 August in the Oude Kerk in Delft, where her prominent tomb is visible still.
As Clara and her husband had no children together, upon her death she donated her considerable riches to various charitable projects, including a fund for "poor relations", typically interpreted as meaning all descendants of her elder half-brother Adriaan and younger half-sister Maritgen. A payment was made to each relation upon their wedding.
Originally a considerable sum of money, the amount paid dwindled over the centuries as a result of inflation and the increasing number of "relations." In the early 20th century the Dutch government retained an official whose only task was maintaining the pedigree of Clara van Spaerwoude's family and disbursing the funds to qualifying relatives.
By the 1920s the fund still held half a million guilders, but the payment per relation had dwindled to the equivalent of €11.35. In 1922 the Dutch government passed a law liquidating the balance of the fund and dispensing it among the poorest 10% of adult van Spaerwoude relations.

USS Pontotoc (AG-94)

USS "Pontotoc" (AK-206/AG-94/AVS-7) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship acquired by the U.S. Navy shortly before the end of World War II. She was configured to carry aviation parts and spares, and to issue them to the U.S. Pacific Fleet and activities as needed.
Constructed at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin.
"Pontotoc" (AVS–7), an aviation supply ship, was laid down as M. C. Hull 2160 by Leatham D. Smith Shipbuilding Co., Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. 15 January 1944; classified "AK-206" on 25 February 1944; launched 2 July 1944; acquired from the U.S. Maritime Commission on a loan-charter basis 28 February 1945; reclassified "AG–94" on 12 March 1945; and commissioned 22 March 1945, Lt. Comdr. C. W. Lockard in command.
World War II-related service.
After shakedown, "Pontotoc" transited the Panama Canal and arrived Pearl Harbor 18 April 1945. Reclassified as "AVS-7" effective 25 May, "Pontotoc" steamed for the Philippine Islands, reporting for duty 8 July at Guiuan, Samar, Philippine Islands. She provided aviation stores on station in the Philippines through the end of hostilities.
Post-war inactivation.
"Pontotoc" then proceeded to the 12th Naval District. She decommissioned and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) 26 April at San Francisco, California. Struck from the Navy List 8 May 1946, she was sold in 1947 to the French firm Messageries Maritimes, and renamed "MV Taurus". In 1960 she was sold again and renamed "MV Tadjera".

<doc id="18832275" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18832275" title="Drug eruption">
Drug eruption

In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin. Most drug-induced cutaneous reactions are mild and disappear when the offending drug is withdrawn. Drugs can also cause hair and nail changes, affect the mucous membranes, or cause itching without outward skin changes.
Diagnosis.
Drug eruptions are diagnosed mainly from the medical history and clinical examination. However, they can mimic a wide range of other conditions, thus delaying diagnosis (for example, in drug-induced lupus erythematosus, or the acne-like rash caused by erlotinib). A skin biopsy, blood tests or immunological tests can also be useful. If the causative agent can not be withdrawn, the symptoms should be relieved as much as possible.
It is estimated that 2—3 percent of hospitalised patients are affected by a drug eruption, and that serious drug eruptions occur in around 1 in 1000 patients.
Classification.
The drug eruption can be an expected adverse effect or an unexpected effect (idiosyncratic). 
Some of the most severe and life-threatening examples of drug eruptions are erythema multiforme, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, DRESS syndrome, erythroderma and exanthematous pustulosis.
By appearance.
The most common type of eruption is a morbilliform (resembling measles) or erythematous rash, but the appearance may also be urticarial, papulosquamous, pustular, purpuric, bullous (with blisters) or lichenoid. Angioedema can also be drug-induced (most notably, by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors).
By mechanism.
The underlying mechanism can be immunological (such as in drug allergies) or non-immunological (for example, in photodermatitis or as a side effect of anticoagulants). A fixed drug eruption is the term for a drug eruption that occurs in the same skin area every time the person is exposed to the drug. Eruptions can occur frequently with a certain drug (for example, with phenytoin), or be very rare (for example, Sweet's syndrome following the administration of colony-stimulating factors).
By drug.
The culprit can be both a prescription drug or an over-the-counter medication. 
Examples of common drugs causing drug eruptions are antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs, sulfa drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), biopharmaceuticals, chemotherapy agents, anticonvulsants, and psychotropic drugs. Common examples include photodermatitis due to local NSAIDs (such as piroxicam) or due to antibiotics (such as minocycline), and the rash following ampicillin in cases of mononucleosis.

Septimal tritone

A septimal tritone is a tritone (about one half of an octave) that involves the factor seven. 
There are two that are inverses. The lesser septimal tritone (also Huygens' tritone) is the musical interval with ratio 7:5 (582.51 cents). The greater septimal tritone (also Euler's tritone), is an interval with ratio 10:7 (617.49 cents). They are also known as the sub-fifth and super-fourth, or subminor fifth and supermajor fourth, respectively.
The difference between these two is the septimal sixth tone (50:49, 34.98 cents) .
The lesser septimal tritone is the most consonant tritone when measured by combination tones, harmonic entropy, and period length.

Lucille Ball Little Theatre of Jamestown is a community theatre company located in Jamestown, New York. It evolved from the Jamestown Players Club and was established as a non-profit corporation in 1936 with the name Little Theatre of Jamestown. The company has its own theatre on East Second St. in Jamestown which it purchased in 1968. Both the company and its theatre were renamed the Lucille Ball Little Theatre of Jamestown in 1991 to honor the actress Lucille Ball, Jamestown's most famous resident. Ball got her acting start with the company's precursor The Players Club and returned in 1945 to perform in a series of skits with the company in Chautauqua's Smith-Wilkes Hall. Throughout her life, she would send the company cash donations as well as costumes from her television and film career. One of her donations, a costume from the film "Gone With the Wind" is still used by the company.
Current theatre.
The company's current home, located at 18 East Second St. in Jamestown, began its life in 1881 as Allen's Opera House. Its proprietor, Abner E. Allen, sold the theatre to Charles Samuels in 1898 when it became known as Samuels Opera House. It was then acquired by the MA Shea Corporation in 1919 and in 1925 was extensively and elegantly refurbished in a Spanish style, which can still be seen in its facade. The Shea Theatre was initially used for vaudeville performances but with the decline of the genre it was turned into a cinema. By the early 1960s the cinema had closed and the building was derelict. It was purchased in 1968 by the Little Theatre of Jamestown, and new theatre was built inside the shell of the old one. Officially renamed the Lucille Ball Little Theatre in 1991, it has a seating capacity of 450, a full stage with a fly system, and a small lobby.

Battle of Huanucopampa

After the disastrous battle of Chimborazo, the expected victor of the war, Huáscar, had been deeply humiliated, his army routed and forced to withdraw to the south, shadowed by a contingent of the northerners sent by Atahualpa under the command of generals Chalcuchimac and Quizquiz, possibly as well Rumiñahui. Huáscar himself split his army along the border in three divisions, one main division commanded by Uampa Yupanqui with troops from Kuntisuyu and from the south, planning to cross the Cotabambas river. Another army was led by Guanca Auqui, Agua Panti, Paca Yupanqui and a third led by Huáscar himself (taking command personally for the first time) and his brothers Tito Atauchi and Topa Atao.The armies met at the plains close to Huanuco, when Huáscar ordered Uampa Yupanqui to take battle with the followers. Initially the battle was reportedly succeful for the Huáscaran troops, with Atahualpa's captain Tomay Rima killed in battle, upon when Huáscar launched a massive assault with all his soldiers. The battle allegedly lasted for an entire day and ended inconclusive, as Chalcuchima and Quizquiz pulled back upon night towards a hill nearby. Huáscar ordered his warriors to burn the grass, causing massive losses among the Atahualpan forces. Instead of pressing this attack, however, Huáscar chose to retreat safely to the south across the river, ordering his brother Topa Atao to fortify a pass carrying the main route to the nearby Inca capital of Cuzco. Once again followed by the army of Quizquiz and Chalcuchima, the latter managed to envelop and destroy the forces of Topa Atao. Permanently losing his possible outlets for advantage, Huáscar was himself defeated and captured at Quipaipan in April, 1532.

Water resources management in Colombia

There is a long and well established framework for water resources management in Colombia. The Environment Ministry and up to 33 Regional Authorities (the first one was created in 1954), are in charge of water resources management and policies at the national and regional and watershed level, respectively. Other sectoral ministries are in charge of water demand for energy, water supply and sanitation and water for irrigation. 
Water resources availability per capita in Colombia was 45,408 cubic meters in 2007, way above the world’s average of 8,209 in the same year and is particularly prone to flooding and landslides. Climate Change is expected to highly affect highland Andean ecosystems, especially moorlands, due to increase in temperatures and aquifer-based freshwater supplies in insular and coastal areas due to sea level increases and saline intrusion. 
Despite the developed legal and institutional framework for water resources management in Colombia, many challenges remain, including: (i) the consideration of water as an abundant resource affect the implementation of certain policies; (ii) fragmentation on water resources management responsibilities and lack of a consistent national strategy; (iii) some lack of coordination between the Environmental Ministry and the Regional Authorities; (iv) lack of capacities at the regional level; (v) governability challenges due to social and environmental issues such as deforestation, illegal crops, urban sprawl…etc.
Water management history and recent developments.
During the 20th Century, Colombian Government focused on increasing knowledge on natural resources as well as developing law and institutions to regulate their uses. For example, in 1952, the Government created the Division for Natural Resources, under the Environment Ministry, aimed at managing land, forestry and fisheries. In 1953, the Government enacted the Decree 1371, also known as the Sanitation Code, which included general rules to control residual water. 
In 1954, the Government, following the model based on the Tennessee Valley Authority, established in the US in 1933, created the Cauca Regional Authority with the objective of managing land and water resources in a multisectoral and integrated way. For the next 50 years, up to 33 Regional Authorities (Corporaciones Autonomas Regionales –CARs) will be created all over Colombia each of them representing the highest authority for natural resources management, including water resources, within their territory and being an integral part of the National Environmental System in Colombia. 
In 1968, the government created the National Institute of Renewable Natural Resources and Environment (INDERENA), encompassing the Division for Natural Resources and the Magdalena and Sinu Regional Authorities. During the 1970s, there was an intense institutional development with the creation of numerous sectoral entities such as the Meteorological Service in charge of analyzing meteorological and hydrological data, the Geographic Institute Agustin Godazzi in charge of land management, INGEOMINAS in charge of groundwater resources management, and Colombian Agricultural Institute in charge of assessing the environmental impacts of fertilizers and pesticides, among others. In addition, Regional Authorities advanced environmental tasks related to water and forestry management. For example, the Regional Authority of Cali and Yumbo was the first regional authority with the equipment and regulation necessary to control industrial discharges on water bodies.
In addition, the government together with INDERENA and the Food and Agriculture Organization collaborated during the 1970s in the creating of the National Code for Renewable Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, also known as the Natural Resources Code, which was finally enacted with Decree 2811 of 1974.
During the 1980s, Natural Resources Code and the 1979 National Sanitation Law were developed through numerous regulations such as the Watershed Decree 2857 of 1981, Atmospheric Releases Decrees 02 of 1982 and 2200 of 1983, and the Water Quality Decree 1594 of 1984.
The new constitution of 1991 included 49 articles for environmental and natural resources protection and was considered for some experts as the “Environmental Constitution.” Finally, Law 99 of 1993 established the current institutional framework in Colombia, in particular it: (i) turned the INDERENA into the Ministry of Environment (ii) created the National Environmental System (iii) established the Regional Authorities as the institutions in charge of implementing national policies and regulations; (iv) finally, included five research institutions into the National Environmental System, namely: 
Water resource base.
Surface and groundwater resources.
According to FAO, Colombia has an annual average rainfall of 3,000mm, with an annual volume of 3,425 cubic kilometers (km3). About 61% of which, or 2,113 km3, represent annual run off. According to IDEAM, 40% of water supply is needed to maintain ecosystems and preserve them from impacts threatening water availability. 
There are five drainage basins in Colombia, which main characteristics are summarized below. 
Key Characteristics of the Drainage Basins
"Source": FAO 
According to the Environment Ministry, groundwater resources have not been sufficiently documented in Colombia. There are studies reflecting potential groundwater resources in areas were groundwater is currently being used which represents only 15% of Colombia’s territory.
Storage capacity and infrastructure.
According to FAO, Colombia has 90 small dams with a total storage capacity of 3.4 km3 and 26 large dams (with a storage capacity of more than 25hm3) with a total capacity of 9.1 km3. Colombia also has about 1,500 lakes with a storage capacity of 8 km3.
Water quality.
The gradual decrease in Colombia's water quality is due to the release of untreated effluents from agriculture, urban settlements and industries. According to Orlando and Arias, there is not a national water quality inventory but rather regional and sporadic studies. For instance the National Planning Division, in a study of 1989 and 1993, estimated that the level of organic material discharged in Colombian water resources is 9,000 BOD per day, of which 4,000 are discharged solely by the agricultural sector. 
Water resources management by sector.
Drinking water and sanitation.
Water supply and sanitation in Colombia has been improved in many ways over the past decades. Between 1990 and 2004, access to sanitation increased from 82% to 86%, but access to water increased only slightly from 92% to 93%.In particular, coverage in rural areas lags behind. Furthermore, despite improvements, the quality of water and sanitation services remains inadequate. For example, only 72% of those receiving public services receive water of potable quality and in 2006 only 25% of the wastewater generated in the country underwent any kind of treatment.
Irrigation and drainage.
In 1991, Colombia had 750,513 hectares (ha) of irrigation or 11.4% of the total agricultural area (6.6 million ha). Public investment accounts for 287,454 ha, or 38% of irrigated area, while private investment accounts for the remaining 62%. Most of the irrigated areas are located in the warm center, Magdalena and Cauca Valleys, and the northeast near Venezuela’s border and along the Caribbean coast. Cauca and Tolimas Valleys have 40% of irrigated land. 
Hydropower.
The electricity sector in Colombia is dominated by large hydropower generation (81% of production) and thermal generation (19%). Despite the country’s large potential in new renewable energy technologies (mainly wind, solar and biomass), this potential has been barely tapped. A 2001 law designed to promote alternative energies lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as feed-in tariffs, and has had little impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with Panama, which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.
An interesting characteristic of the Colombian electricity sector (as well as of its water sector) is a system of cross-subsidies from users living in areas considered as being relatively affluent, and from users consuming higher amounts of electricity, to those living in areas considered as being poor and to those who use less electricity.
The electricity sector has been unbundled into generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization since sector reforms carried out in 1994. About half the generation capacity is privately owned. Private participation in electricity distribution is much lower.
Legal and institutional framework.
Legal framework.
The water resources management legal framework consists of the following laws and regulations, presented in chronological order: 
Institutional framework.
The Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development, is in charge of environmental management in Colombia at the national level. The Ministry formulates water resources management policies and regulations including pollution standards and charge fees. It also manages protected areas and grants licenses to infrastructure projects.
The Corporaciones Autónomas Regionales (CARs) are the institutions in charge of implementing national policies and regulations as well as managing natural resources and promote sustainable development within their boundaries. CARs are public institutions consisting on public and private territorial entities (NGOS, businesses, communities) sharing the same biogeography, hydro-geographic and geopolitical area as well as representatives of the Ministry and Presidency at the national level. They are administrative and financially independent, although they receive resources form the national government. CARs financial resources consist mainly on environmental taxes generated within their jurisdiction. There are currently 33 CARs in Colombia.
Finally, the Instituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia, y Estudios Ambientales (IDEAM) operates the national hydrological and meteorological network. The Decree No. 1729 of 2002 established two main responsibilities for IDEAM: (i) establishing criteria to classify and prioritize river basins; and (ii) creating a technical and scientific guide aimed at helping CARs in the creation of Watershed Ordering Plans. The guide was published in 2004 and IDEAM together with the Environment Ministry is in the process of creating a second part which will monitor the implementation of WRM in pilot river basins.
Government strategy.
In 2002, Colombian government issued the Decree 1729 aimed at establishing water resource management at the river basin level including a timeframe and financial resources available for the elaboration of Watershed Ordering Plans (Planes Integrales de Ordenamiento y Manejo de Microcuencas – PIOM). IDEAM was responsible for elaborating a guide to inform river basing planning which was published on 2004. CARs are in charge of formulating and approving this plan in accordance with the steps included in IDEAM’s technical guide, which are: Readiness, Diagnostic, Prospective, Formulation, Execution and Monitoring and Evaluation. CARs are granted with the responsibility to grant permits including water use and pollution, as well as submit to the municipal authorities’ restrictions for land use. 
International agreements.
The Amazon Cooperation Treaty, signed in 1978 by Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela, aims at promoting sustainable use of natural resources, including water, in the Amazon Basin
On 25 June 2005, after the approval of a US$ 700,000 grant by the Global Environment Fund the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, the General Secretariat of the Organization of American States and the United Nations Development Program agreed to sign the Integrated and Sustainable Management of Transboundary Water Resources in the Amazon River Basin Considering Climate Variability and Change Project. The project aims to strengthen the institutional framework for planning and executing, in a coordinated and coherent manner, activities for the protection and sustainable management of water resources in the Amazon Basin in the face of impacts caused by human action and ongoing climatic changes being experienced in the Basin.
Water pricing.
Water use charges were established in Law 99 of 1993 and defined in Decree 155 of 2004. Water use charges have two components, minimum and regional. The minimum is established every year by the Ministry of Environment. The regional component consist of a number of elements such as water availability, socio-economic aspects, investment needed, opportunity cost and is established every year by the local CAR, who also collect the fee and have to be invested in the watershed according to the PIOM. Water use charges for the volume of water abstraction to all users who are granted water concessions. 
Environmental issues.
Water related risks.
Erosion is a natural phenomenon which can be aggravated by manmade situations increasing risks produced by landslides, flood, avalanches, mudfloods…etc. Erosion impact are usually severe on dry areas, due to lack of vegetation. In Colombia, areas such as Cúcuta, Villa de Leyva, Tatacoa dessert in Huila, Chicamocha canyon, La Guajira, Valle de Tenza, Valle Medio del Patía are especially vulnerable. 
The Magdalena System, oriental valleys and Atratoa and Magdalena basins, delta waterways such as the Arauca, Grande de Santa Marta, and the Grande de Lorica wetland and the Mojana and Momposina areas are especially prone to floods and river overflow. 
Potential climate change impacts.
According to the first national communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Colombia is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Highland Andean ecosystems, especially moorlands, are expected to be seriously affected by increase in temperature which has recorded a net increase of 0.2-0.3 degrees Celsius per decade during the period 1961-1990 – according to the Meteorological, Hydrological and Environmental Studies Institute—and is expected to continue to do so by the Meteorological Research Institute of Japan. Hydrological temperature changes would result in a loss of biodiversity and the services attached to those such as water supply, basin regulation and hydropower.
In addition, the National University of Colombia analyzed possible impacts of a doubling of the carbon dioxide emissions between the years 2050 to 2080 and projects a sea level rise of 2 to 5mm per year. Sea level increases will likely cause saline intrusion into aquifer-based freshwater supplies in insular and coastal areas. Freshwater systems and their biological diversity will be severely affected. Moreover, prognostic modeling of small islands has identified major land loss if no action is taken. For example, in San Andres Island, the first National Communications estimated a loss of 17% of land area, including most of the coastal zone by 2060 (50 cm increase in sea level).
Ongoing programs and initiatives.
In 2006, the World Bank contributed US$5.4 million, out of a total of US$14.9 million, for the creation of an Integrated National Adaptation Project to support Colombia's efforts to define and implement specific pilot adaptation measures and policy options to meet the anticipated impacts from climate change. These efforts will be focused on high mountain ecosystems, insular areas and on human health concerns related to the expansion of areas for vectors linked to malaria and dengue, as identified as priority areas in the National Communications and other studies.
In June 2008, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a loan for US$100,000 for a project “Biodiversity and Climate Change: mainstreaming biodiversity conservation through avoided deforestation in the Andean-Amazon piedmont of Colombia.” The project aims at developing methodologies and supporting pilot demonstrations on how to reliably measure carbon stored in standing forests. These efforts will enable national and local institutions to apply the methodology and implement mitigating measures to lower deforestation rates along the Pasto-Mocoa road, southern Colombia, in order to generate carbon credits for these mitigating actions.

Kieran Djilali

Kieran Stephen Larbi Allen-Djilali (born 22 January 1991), more commonly known as Kieran Djilali, is an English footballer who plays as a midfielder for League of Ireland side Sligo Rovers.
Club career.
Crystal Palace and loans.
Born in Lambeth, London, Djilali came through the academy at Crystal Palace, going on trial with Manchester United in mid-2007. He made his Palace debut at 17, followed quickly by a string of first-team appearances in which he impressed. A year later he moved to League Two side Chesterfield, where he scored his first career goal in a game against Darlington on 21 November 2009.
He returned to Crystal Palace following his loan spell on 12 January 2010, and scored his first goal for Palace against Doncaster Rovers on 27 February 2010. He began the following season in Palace's first team but dropped out as manager George Burley sought to bring in more experienced players. In February, he returned to table-topping Chesterfield for a second loan spell, helping them to win the League Two title. When his contract at parent club Crystal Palace expired, he opted to leave Selhurst Park in the summer of 2011 to seek more game time.
AFC Wimbledon.
In July 2011, Djilali played on trial for Scunthorpe United, but ended up signing for League Two club AFC Wimbledon on 26 August. On 3 September, he made his debut for the club, against Port Vale. On 10 March 2012, he scored his first goal for the club, against Dagenham & Redbridge. In May 2012, Djilali was released from the club as his contract expired.
Portsmouth.
On 16 August 2012, Djilali signed a one-month contract with League One side Portsmouth. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Bournemouth on the opening day of the League One season, but was released after just two weeks due to Portsmouth's tight wage budget, with manager Michael Appleton putting Djilali's release down to his lack of fitness.
Return to AFC Wimbledon.
On 16 November 2012, Djilali re-signed for AFC Wimbledon on a short-term deal. Manager Neal Ardley said of the move: "Kieran has been with us for a month now. He has trained well and showed a very good attitude. He has the potential to play at a higher level but first he needs to prove himself with us. With the busy winter period coming on, we thought we should augment the squad and take the chance to have a good look at him in competitive action." Djilali was released by AFC Wimbledon on 31 January 2013.
Sligo Rovers.
In March 2013, Djilali signed a contract with League of Ireland champions Sligo Rovers. He made his debut on 8 March, against Derry City. On 18 March, he scored his first goal for Sligo, against Bray Wanderers.

Kansas Court of Appeals

The Kansas Court of Appeals is the intermediate-level appellate court for the U.S. state of Kansas.
History.
The Kansas Legislature crated the first Kansas Court of Appeals in 1895, to help the Kansas Supreme Court with an increasingly heavy caseload. The original statute that created the court contained a sunset provision that allowed the court to expire in 1901. The Court of Appeals was reestablished permanently in 1977 as a seven member appellate court—expanded to ten judges in 1987, then later to twelve.
Jurisdiction.
The Court of Appeals hears all appeals from orders of the State Corporation Commission, original actions in habeas corpus, and all appeals from the state district courts in both civil and criminal cases (except those that may be appealed directly to the Kansas Supreme Court).
Procedures.
Kansas Court of Appeals judges sit in panels of three at locations throughout the state, but most frequently at the primary courtroom in the Kansas Judicial Center in Topeka. The court also has the power to review matters "en banc". Each panel typically rules on approximately 30 appeals over a two-day period every month. Decisions of the Court of Appeals are filed weekly, usually on Friday mornings.
There is no right to an appeal from the judgments of the Court of Appeals. Parties who lose their appeal in the Court of Appeals may petition the Kansas Supreme Court to review the decision, but the justices are not required to do so.
Judges.
Court of Appeals judges are appointed to four-year terms by the Governor of Kansas, with confirmation by the Kansas Senate. Until 2013, the Governor would appoint a justice from a list of qualified individuals submitted to him by the Kansas Supreme Court Nominating Commission. The Kansas Supreme Court is responsible for selecting the chief judge of the court.
As of 2013, the judges on the court are:

Trumpet Concerto (Leopold Mozart)

Leopold Mozart's Trumpet Concerto in D major was completed in 1762, and is now "popular with trumpeters." The work is in two movements:
Besides the solo trumpet in D, the concerto is scored for two horns in D and strings. Only the first movement provides room for a cadenza; the Gábor Darvas edition published by Editio Musica gives an 8-measure cadenza which requires no ledger lines but consistently involves small note values. In fact, in regards to range, the concerto is "cautious."
Discography.
Nikolaus Harnoncourt with Vienna Concentus Musicus chooses this Trumpet Concerto to cap off a disc of music by the composer's son, which includes the Bassoon Concerto K. 191.. 
It can also be found on CDs with trumpet concertos by other composers, such as George Vosburgh's recording with the Seattle Symphony and Gerard Schwarz, which includes Joseph Haydn's Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major, Johann Nepomuk Hummel's Trumpet Concerto in E major and Georg Philipp Telemann's Trumpet Concerto in D major. The Naxos Records album "The Art of the Baroque Trumpet", Volume 1, with Niklas Eklund, groups Mozart's Concerto with Baroque trumpet concertos such as the aforementioned Telemann, and adds Molter, Purcell, Fasch and Handel. Eklund wrote his own cadenza for the first movement. Miroslav Kejmar also includes it in his "Famous Trumpet Concerti" album, which besides Joseph Haydn's is all Baroque. On Telarc, Rolf Smedvig with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra conducted by Jahja Ling plays Mozart's Concerto as well as Telemann's and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2.

<doc id="18832458" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18832458" title="Wehali">
Wehali

Wehali ("Wehale", "Waihali", "Veale") is the name of a traditional kingdom at the southern coast of Central Timor, now in the Republic of Indonesia. It is often mentioned together with its neighbouring sister kingdom, as Wewiku-Wehali (Waiwiku-Wehale). Wehali held a position of ritual seniority among the many small Timorese kingdoms.
Geography and society.
Wehali is centred at the village of Laran, situated on a fertile plain which is well suited for varied agriculture. It belongs to the South Tetun-speaking area, which is also known as Belu. The southern Tetun have a matrilineal system. At the apex of the political system stood a "great lord" (Nai Bot) who held the title of Maromak Oan ("son of God"), and this title has given by Dutch Colony. His task was ritually passive, in a symbolic sense "female", and he kept an executive "male" regent or assistant by his side, the Liurai ("surpassing the land").
History.
According to oral tradition Wehali was the first land that appeared from the waters which once covered the earth, which made it the centre or origin of the world from a Timorese perspective. Other traditions mention a migration from Sina Mutin Malaka (Chinese White Malacca) in ancient times. The historical background of this is not clear, but the account of Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan expedition, who visited Timor in 1522, confirms the importance of the Wewiku-Wehali kingdom. In the seventeenth century the ruler of Wehali was described as "an emperor, whom all the kings on the island adhere to with tribute, as being their sovereign". He entertained friendly contacts with the Muslim kingdom of Makassar, but his power was checked by devastating invasions by the Portuguese in 1642 and 1665. Wehali was now brought inside the Portuguese sphere of power but appears to have had limited contact with its colonial suzerain.
Dutch East India Company.
The Portuguese grip over western Timor receded greatly after 1749, and the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC), which had hitherto been confined to Kupang, expanded its sphere of power over large parts of the island. During the 1750s Wehali approached the VOC, and in 1756 the Liurai Jacinto Correia signed a contract with the Dutch diplomat Johannes Andreas Paravicini. According to this contract the Liurai was the overlord over a large number of Timorese kingdoms, including Dirma, Laclo, Luca, Viqueque, Corara and Banibani. The Dutch hoped that the contract would automatically include most of East Timor in their sphere of power, but the ritual rather than executive authority of Wehali was insufficient for this. In effect, Wehali vacillated between the Dutch and Portuguese sides for the next century.
Partition and later colonial rule.
A colonial borderline on Timor was finally agreed on in 1859, which left Wehali on the Dutch side. A Dutch official was posted in Atapupu on the north coast of Belu in 1862, but the south coast was not surveyed by the colonial authorities before 1898. Brief military clashes took place in 1900 and 1906. The Dutch proceeded to restructure the administrative divisions of Belu in 1915-16, trying to use traditional rulers as zelfbestuurders (rajas under colonial surveillance). The Maromak Oan, Baria Nahak, died in 1925, and the Dutch unsuccessfully tried to use his nephew Seran Nahak as Raja of Belu in 1925-30. After the achievement of independence for Indonesia in 1949, the traditional forms of governance were phased out, but the traditional elite groups still retain an amount of local importance.

Quo Vadis is a 2001 Polish film directed by Jerzy Kawalerowicz based on the book of the same title by Henryk Sienkiewicz. It was Poland's submission to the 74th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not nominated.
Plot.
The central plot in the movie revolves around the love of a Roman patrician, Marcus Vinicius, towards a Christian girl (coming from the territory of modern-day Poland) set against the backdrop of the persecutions against Christians during the reign of Nero.
In the beginning, Lygia, a Christian and hostage of Rome, becomes the object of Vinicius' love but she refuses his advances. Vinicius' friend Petronius tries to manipulate Nero, who has authority over all Roman hostages, to give Lygia to Vinicius, but Lygia is taken into hiding by Christians. Marcus Vinicius decides to find her and force her to be his wife. He goes to a Christian meeting along with Croton, a gladiator, to find her. After following her from the meeting, Marcus tries to take her, but Ursus, a strong man and friend of Lygia, kills Croton. Marcus himself is wounded in the fight, but is taken care of by Lygia and the Christians. Seeing their kindness he begins to convert to Christianity, and Lygia accepts him.
Rome catches fire while the emperor, Nero, is away. Nero returns and sings to the crowd, but they become angry. At the suggestion of Nero's wife, the Christians are blamed for the fire, providing a long series of cruel spectacles to appease the crowd. In one of the spectacles, Ursus faces a bull carrying Lygia on its back. Ursus wins and, with the crowd and guards in approval, Nero lets them live.
Nero kills himself, and Vinicius and Lygia leave Rome.

History of Brunswick, Georgia

The recorded History of Brunswick, Georgia dates to 1738, when a plantation was established along the Turtle River. By 1789, the city was recognized by President George Washington as having been one of five original ports of entry for the American colonies. In 1797, Burnswick's prominence was further recognized when it became the county seat of Glynn County, a status it retains to this day. During the later stages of the Civil War, with the approach of the Union Army, much of the city was abandoned and burned. Economic prosperity eventually returned, when a large lumber mill was constructed in the area. By the late 19th-century, despite yellow fever epidemics and occasional hurricanes, business in Brunwick was thriving, due to port business for cotton, lumber, naval stores, and oysters. During this period, Brunswick also enjoyed a tourist trade, stimulated by nearby Jekyll Island, which had become a posh, exclusive getaway for some of the era's most influential people. World War I stimulated ship building activity in Brunswick. But it was not until World War II that the economy boomed, when 16,000 workers were employed to produce ninety-nine Liberty ships and "Knot" ships. During the war, Brunswick's Glynco Naval Air Station was, for a time, the largest blimp base in the world. Since the end of World War II, the city has enjoyed a period of moderate economic activity, centered on its deep natural port, which is the western-most harbor on the eastern seaboard. In recent years, in recognition of a thriving local enterprise, Brunswick has declared itself to be the "Shrimp Capital of the World".
Early colonization.
As early as 1738, the area's first English settler, Mark Carr, a captain in General James Oglethorpe's Marine Boat Company, established his plantation along the Turtle River (at an area known as Plug Point). In 1771, the Royal Province of Georgia purchased Carr's fields and laid out the town of Brunswick in the grid style following Oglethorpe's Savannah Plan. Brunswick obtained its name from the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Germany, the ancestral home of King George II of Great Britain.
In 1789, George Washington proclaimed Brunswick one of the five original ports of entry for the colonies. Because of this notion, the city began to prosper, and in 1797, the Georgia General Assembly in Louisville transferred the county seat of Glynn County from Frederica on St. Simons Island to Brunswick.
Commerce and expansion.
Little development occurred in the town during the thirty years after its designation as the county seat. Records show that Glynn Academy, the first public building, was built in 1819; it closed four years later due to lack of attendance. The school soon re-opened, however, and in 1840, a new building was erected on Hillsborough Square, the present location of Glynn Academy. In 1826, the Georgia General Assembly granted title to much of the undeveloped town to Urbanus Dart and William R. Davis. Soon after the title was granted, Brunswick had a courthouse, a jail, and about thirty houses and stores. Along with the founder of the Brunswick and Florida Railroad, Thomas Butler King of St. Simons Island, Dart and Davis formed a company to construct a canal north to the Altamaha River, connecting the natural port with interior plantations.
In 1836, the Oglethorpe House hotel was built; two years later, a newspaper was started and a new bank opened. But the panic of 1837 caused cotton and timber prices to plummet and languished the progress of the canal and railroad projects. The Cotton Crash of 1839 only put the city in further jeopardy.
Following a period of recession, the Altamaha-Brunswick Canal opened in 1854, followed by the railroad in 1856. Brunswick received its second charter that very year and was officially incorporated as a city on February 22, 1856. In 1860, the city had a population of 468, a weekly newspaper, a bank, and a sawmill.
American Civil War.
During the Civil War, the Confederate States Army burned the St. Simons Island Lighthouse as they left to keep it from falling into Union hands. In Brunswick, wharves as well as the Oglethorpe House (which would have made an ideal headquarters or hospital for the Union Army) were burned. When the city was ordered to evacuate, most of the citizens fled to nearby Waynesville. The canal and railroad ceased operation, and Brunswick was abandoned.
After suffering from post-war depression into the 1870s, in 1874, one of the nation's largest lumber mills began operation on St. Simons Island, leading to the return of economic prosperity. Canals and rivers gave way to rail traffic as the Brunswick & Albany and Macon & Brunswick railroads connected Georgia to the Port of Brunswick.
Late 19th century.
In 1878, poet and native Georgian Sidney Lanier wrote his world-famous poem "The Marshes of Glynn" based on the salt marshes that lie in Glynn County as he sought relief from tuberculosis in Brunswick's climate. The Sidney Lanier Bridge, which spans across the marshes, is named in his honor. There is a historical marker overlooking the marshes of Glynn commemorating Lanier and the poem, and a live oak tree near the marker is named the Sidney Lanier Oak.
The December 1888 issue of Harper's Weekly predicted that "Brunswick by the Sea" was destined to become the winter Newport. Jekyll Island had become a posh, exclusive getaway for some of the era's most influential people. Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers, and Goodyears escaped to Brunswick and the Golden Isles to hunt, fish, and mingle. People flocked to the breathtaking Oglethorpe Hotel once it opened its doors in 1888.
In 1893, a yellow fever epidemic compounded the troubles brought by worldwide depression. Two hurricanes, one in 1893 and one in 1898, and their resulting storm surge flooded the city. However, the city quickly recovered because of the ever-expanding port business for cotton, lumber, naval stores, and oysters.
The World Wars.
Wooden and concrete ships designed to repel mines were built in Brunswick for World War I. A large gunpowder and munitions plant was built to the northwest of town, but it was not completed before the war ended.
During World War II, German U-boats threatened the coast of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. Blimps became a common site as they patrolled the coastal areas. During the war, blimps from Brunswick's Glynco Naval Air Station, at the time the largest blimp base in the world, safely escorted almost 100,000 ships without a single vessel lost to enemy submarines.
Liberty ships.
In World War II, Brunswick boomed as over 16,000 workers of the J. A. Jones Construction Company produced ninety-nine Liberty ships and "Knot" ships (Type C1-M ships which were designed for short coastal runs, and most often named for knots) for the U.S. Maritime Commission to transport matériel to the European and Pacific Theatres.
The first ship was the SS "James M. Wayne" (named after James Moore Wayne), whose keel was laid on July 6, 1942 and was launched on March 13, 1943. The last ship was the SS "Coastal Ranger", whose keel was laid on June 7, 1945 and launched on August 25, 1945. The first six ships took 305 to 331 days each to complete, but soon production ramped up and most of the remaining ships were built in about two months, bringing the average down to 89 days each. By November 1943, about four ships were launched per month. The SS "William F. Jerman" was completed in only 34 days in November and December 1944. Six ships could be under construction in slipways at one time.
In December 1944, the United States Navy requested six ships from each shipyard. The workers guaranteed the delivery of not six, but "seven" ships. For the first eleven months of 1944, an average of 4.27 ships were launched per month. Up to this point the shipyard had never produced more than five ships in a calendar month, except for August 1944, in which six ships were launched. However, the first ship of August 1944 was launched on August 1 and the last one on August 31, and only three ships had been launched in July and only four ships were launched in September. So a ship that might well have been launched in July was actually launched on August 1. The workers fulfilled their promise of completing seven ships in December 1944 by working overtime, including working on Christmas Day. Apart from the ships launched in December 1944, only one ship was completed in under 43 days. With the extra work, all of the ships launched this month were completed in 34 to 42 days (which included the SS "William F. Jerman" mentioned above).
Furthermore, the workers asked that they not be paid for their extra work. Each worker endorsed their time-and-a-half paycheck over to the government. They never produced more than five ships in a calendar month again, although a full five ships had been launched in the previous month of November and five more were launched the next month, January 1945. By March 1945 production of ships started to decline. The last ship launched was the SS "Coastal Ranger", launched on August 25, 1945, shortly after the war ended.
Most of the Liberty ships from Brunswick were assigned to U.S. shipping companies and most of them were named after famous Americans (starting with U.S. Supreme Court Justices from the South). However, numbers 19, 29, and 31–40 went to Great Britain (Ministry of War Transport) under the Supplemental Defense Appropriations Act of 1941 "(see Lend-Lease)" and were given one-word names starting with "Sam" (e.g. "Samdee"). Number 73 went to the Norwegian government.
An iron cut-away scale model (approximately 1:20) of a Liberty ship had been built for employee training. Sometime after the end of World War II this was put on display in Brunswick at the end of F. J. Torras Causeway near the shipyards. It was not maintained, however, and after twenty years it rusted badly and was scrapped. In 1987, efforts began to build and display a new model. This scale model was unveiled on August 23, 1991 in Mary Ross Park. It is very similar to the original scale model except that it is not cut away to reveal the inner decks. A new park (called "Liberty Ship Park") is currently under construction near the site of the original Sidney Lanier Bridge and the model is to be moved there.
1991 plane crash.
An Atlantic Southeast Airlines Embraer EMB 120 plane crashed in Brunswick on April 5, 1991 due to propeller control failure. The crash claimed the lives of all twenty-three people on board, including former U.S. Senator John Tower of Texas and astronaut Sonny Carter.
2007 Murder.
6-year-old Christopher Barrios Jr., was raped and murdered on March 8, 2007. Peggy Edenfield, David Edenfield and George Edenfield where all accused of the murder.
Modern-day.
Today Brunswick is home to a thriving port, the deepest natural port in the area. As the western-most harbor on the eastern seaboard, as well as the proclaimed "Shrimp Capital of the World," Brunswick bustles with activity. The city is also home to Hercules, one of the oldest and most important yellow-pine chemical plants in the world. Rich-SeaPak Corporation and King and Prince Seafood are also based in the area. The Georgia Ports Authority Mayor's Point and Marine Point Terminals, as well as the Colonel's Island Bulk Facility attract business from around the world.
Brunswick's Old Town residential and commercial district is the largest small town, urban National Register of Historic Places district in Georgia. Downtown is undergoing a revitalization through the National Main Street Program, preserving and showcasing its distinctive historic structures. Annual events such as the Old Town Tour of Homes, Concerts in the Square, the Brunswick Stewbilee, and HarborFest encourage visitors to discover the charms of Brunswick's parks and gracious homes.

<doc id="18832531" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18832531" title="18p-">
18p-

18p- is a genetic condition caused by a deletion of all or part of the short arm (the p arm) of chromosome 18. It occurs in about 1 of every 40,000 births.
Nomenclature.
The preferred terminology for this condition is 18p-. In the past, it has been referred to as partial monosomy 18p and, rarely, as “de Grouchy syndrome, type 1".
Genetic Basis.
18p- describes a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 18. About half of the people with deletions have a breakpoint at the centromere.
Diagnosis.
Suspicion of a chromosome abnormality is typically raised due to the presence of developmental delays or birth defects. Diagnosis of 18p- is usually made via a blood sample. A routine chromosome analysis, or karyotype, is usually used to make the initial diagnosis, although it may also be made by microarray analysis. Increasingly, microarray analysis is also being used to clarify breakpoints. Prenatal diagnosis is possible via amniocentesis of chorionic villus sampling.
Clinical Description.
18p- causes a wide range of medical and developmental concerns. There is significant variation in severity. This variation is due to the variability of the deletion size and breakpoints.
Congenital Anomalies.
About 10-15% of individuals with 18p- have holoprosencephaly.
Approximately 10% of people with 18p- have a congenital heart anomaly. There does not appear to be a specific type of heart defect associated with a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 18. Septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, dextrocardia, and coarctation of the aorta have all been reported in infants with 18p-.
Neurologic.
Hypotonia is frequently seen in the 18p- population. Seizures, though uncommon, have been reported in people with 18p-. Dystonia has also been diagnosed in a small minority of young adults with 18p-. Also, tethered cord has been reported in a few people with 18p-.
MRI Abnormalities.
In some children without “classic” holoprosencephaly, microforms of holoprosencephaly may be noted on MRI, including missing olfactory tracts and bulbs and absent or hypoplastic corpus callosum.
Vision.
ptosis is quite common among people with 18p-. In many cases, surgical correction is required. Refractive errors, such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism, are also prevalent. Strabismus has been reported in infants and children with 18p-. Nystagmus is also present in a minority of individuals.
Ear and Sinus Infections.
Children with 18p- have an increased incidence of ear infections, often requiring the placement of PE tubes.
Hearing.
Conductive hearing loss may occur due to otitis media.
Gastrointestinal.
Chronic constipation is a frequent complaint in the 18p- population. Other abdominal abnormalities that have been reported include inguinal hernias; malrotation of the gut; and abnormalities of the spleen.
Genitourinary.
Genitourinary abnormalities are not common in 18p-. There have been a few cases of small penis and cryptorchidism in males and uterine abnormalities in females.
Orthopedics.
There have been several orthopedic concerns identified in individuals with 18p-. These include pes planus, clubfoot, scoliosis and/or kyphosis, pectus abnormalities, cubitus valgus, congenital hip dysplasia, spina bifida occulta, and genu valgus.
Endocrinology.
Growth hormone deficiency has been reported in several individuals with 18p-, though not at the same frequency as in the distal 18q- population. Panhypopituitarism and hypothyroidism have each been diagnosed in a handful of individuals
Psychiatry.
There is an increased incidence of psychiatric conditions within the distal 18p- population. In one study, 2 of 3 people with 18p- had an anxiety disorder, 1 of 3 had a communication disorder, and 1 of 3 had a motor skills disorders, and 1 of 3 had a stereotypic movement disorder. Additional research with a larger number of subjects is necessary to confirm these findings.
Cognition and adaptive skills.
Cognitive ability in individuals with 18p- varies widely, with most falling in the mild to moderate range of impairment, though there have been some reports of people with impairment in the severe to profound range. These individuals may have had holoprosencephaly, which is frequently associated with severe impairment.
Speech deficits are quite common within this population. Frequently, expressive speech lags behind other developmental parameters.
Dysmorphology.
Common facial features include a flat and broad nasal bridge; epicanthic folds; wide mouth; short philtrum; everted lower lip; small and slightly receding chin during childhood. The ears may be low-set and posteriorly rotated. The posterior hairline may be low.
Treatment.
At present, treatment for 18p- is symptomatic, meaning that the focus is on treating the signs and symptoms of the conditions as they arise. To ensure early diagnosis and treatment, it is suggested that people with 18p- undergo routine screenings for hearing and vision problems.
Current Research.
Currently, research is focusing on identifying the role of the genes on 18p in causing the signs and symptoms associated with deletions of 18p. This will ultimately enable predictive genotyping.
TGIF-Mutations and deletions of this gene have been associated with holoprosencephaly. Penetrance is incomplete, meaning that a deletion of one copy of this gene is not in and of itself sufficient to cause holoprosencephaly. Ten to fifteen percent of people with 18p- have holoprosencephaly, suggesting that other genetic and environmental facts play a role in the etiology of holoprosencephaly in these individuals.

Ephedra foliata, with the common name shrubby horsetail, is a species of "Ephedra".
The plant is native to Western Asia, the Middle East, and Central Asia, from Egypt to Iran and India. 
"Ephedra foliata" was originally described by Pierre Edmond Boissier, later validly published by Carl Anton von Meyer in 1846, and placed in section "Pseudobaccatae" (=sect. "Ephedra"), "tribe" "Scandentes" by Otto Stapf in 1889. In 1996 Robert A. Price classified "E. foliata" in section "Ephedra" without recognizing a tribe.

Edouard Wah

Edouard King Fong Wah (b. 1938, Port-au-Prince, Haiti; – d. September 30, 2003, Port-au-Prince, Haiti), better known as Edouard Wah, was a renowned Haitian painter.
Early life.
Wah was born and raised in the country's capital city of Port-au-Prince. Wah was of mixed ancestry: his father was a Chinese immigrant and his mother was a black Haitian. At the age of seven, while attending one of the best parochial schools of the capital, he received his first formal instruction in perspective and anatomy. To further enhance his natural abilities, his father had him tutored by one of Haiti's premier art teachers during that era.
A few years later, Wah began utilizing mediums he hadn't had much practice with before, notably oil, on canvas and masonite. Early in his career, he deviated from his original "naif" style characteristic of Haitian art to experiment with classical era painting. After experimenting and subsequently mastering these styles, he ultimately settled for the modern eclectic style which he then identified himself with, despite the fact that it was introduced to him in the latter part of his artistic career.
Years in Port-au-Prince.
In 1952, Wah and his younger brother Bernard studied at Foyer des Arts Plastiques school in Port-au-Prince, picking up new techniques with such Haitian experts as Petion Savin, Dieudonne Cedor, Wilson Jolicoeur, Luckner Lazard and many others. Aside from painting, Wah's other interests included acting which he took up as a side job to his artistic career.
In 1963, Wah decided to found a cultural center "Calfou", also in Port-au-Prince as a means of allowing people to experience Haitian culture, notably the arts and music. During that same year, he and his brother were commissioned by the Haitian government to restore the murals in the bicentennial section of the city, which encompassed certain other cultural centers and public buildings in the capital.
Legacy.
In 1971, during the peak of the Duvalier regime, he emigrated to the United States, relocating to Philadelphia where he would reside for the next thirteen years. On one of many visits to his homeland, Edouard King Fong Wah died on September 27, 2003 in his beloved country of Haiti.

Sir Thomas Salusbury, 2nd Baronet

Sir Thomas Salusbury, 2nd Baronet (March 1612 – 1643) was a Welsh poet, politician and soldier, who supported King Charles I in English Civil War and was a colonel of a Royalist regiment.
Life.
Salusbury was born in March 1612, the eldest son of Sir Henry Salusbury of Lleweni, the first of the Salusbury Baronets. After spending some time at Jesus College, Oxford without taking a degree, he entered the Inner Temple in November 1631 but left in July 1632 on the death of his father to take control of the family estate at Lleweni Hall, Denbighshire.
He was a member of the commission of the peace for Flintshire and Denbighshire, Wales and was elected to the common council of the Denbigh corporation in 1632. He was MP for Denbighshire in the Short Parliament of 1640, but said little; his relative Sir Thomas Myddleton succeeded him in the Long Parliament.
During the English Civil War he was on the side of Charles I, becoming colonel of a royalist regiment from north Wales. His efforts on behalf of the King led to the House of Commons calling him a traitor. He fought at the Battle of Edgehill and was awarded an honorary DCL Oxford degree by the King a few days later. He fell ill at Worcester and died, being buried in the family vault at Whitchurch on 13 July 1643.
Poetry.
Salusbury was regarded as a noted poet, but only "The History of Joseph" was published when he was alive (in 1636), although there are manuscripts of other poems and dramatic works. Anthony Wood (1632–1695) wrote that "having a natural geny to poetry and romance", he became "a most noted poet of his time"; but his only known production is "The History of Joseph" (London, 1636, 4to), "a very rare poem" and a "scarce volume", dedicated to Lady Myddelton or Middleton, fourth wife and widow of the author's grandfather, Sir Thomas Myddelton, as an acknowledgment of her care for him in his youth. Among the commendatory verses printed at the beginning are some by two kinsmen of the author (John Salusbury senior and junior respectively), the latter most probably being of Bachegraig, Flintshire, and an ancestor of Mrs. Piozzi.
Family.
He was survived by wife, Hester (daughter of Sir Edward Tyrrell of Thornton, Buckinghamshire), and by his son and heir, Thomas.

Purgatory (drama)

Purgatory is a drama by the Irish writer William Butler Yeats. It was first presented in at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, on 19 August 1938, a few months before Yeats' death.
Story.
It tells a family saga of decline and fall through its two remaining members: an Old Man (the father) and a Boy (his sixteen year old son). It is set outside the former family home, which the Old Man's father had drunkenly burned down, leading him to kill his father as the building perished. The Boy is skeptical about tales of his family's former grandeur, and is repelled by the Old Man's story of losing his own mother as she gave birth to him, and the decline subsequent events wrought on the family. Tonight, the Old Man tells the Boy, is the anniversary of his mother's wedding night. This was the night on which he was conceived after a bout of drunken carousing by his father, and thus when his mother's fate was sealed. At this point a ghostly figure appears illuminated in a window of the wrecked house. In an attempt to wrest his mother's soul from purgatory, he suddenly stabs and kills the Boy. However it appears to be in vain: approaching hoof beats of his ghostly father returning to the bridal bed signal that no spirits have left the place, and the grim cycle begins again.
Background.
Yeats had been strongly influenced by Japanese Noh theatre in the later years of his life (via Ezra Pound), and Yeats' use of the spirits of the Old Man's parents as a metaphor for the family's decline and of death and rebirth is Noh's clearest influence on the drama. Similarly, the sparseness of the setting, the use of only two characters and the play's relative brevity (conventionally lasting well under an hour) are more immediate influences. However the story itself affected Yeats even more profoundly. As he wrote "Purgatory" he admitted in a letter that the scenario troubled him:
I have a one-act play in my head, a scene of tragic intensity... I am so afraid of that dream. My recent work has greater strangeness and I think greater intensity than anything I have done. I never remember the dream so deep.
Critical reception.
Always seen as a grim tale, "Purgatory" received (and continues to receive) mixed responses. Several critics ignore the Noh influence and see in the Old Man's murder of the Boy an exercise in eugenics and as such perceive the conclusion as somewhat tendentious. T. S. Eliot took a similar line, attacking the play's title from a Christian perspective, arguing that murder does not sit with any notion of purgation.
Operas.
Gordon Crosse.
The English composer Gordon Crosse set Yeats' drama as a one-act opera. Premièred at the 1966 Cheltenham International Festival, it includes virtually all of Yeats' original text. It also retains the minimalism of the play, and the spiritual element, but Crosse avoids using Japanese musical motifs associated with Noh, unlike Benjamin Britten, whose contemporaneous parables beginning with "Curlew River" are more obviously musically inspired by Noh. Two additional operatic settings include one by Hugo Weisgall written in 1958, and Mark Lanz Weiser's setting (1990) premièring at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore in 1991.
Ed Di Lello.
Ed Di Lello composed, orchestrated, conducted and staged "Purgatory" as an opera on a double bill with Yeats' "The Cat and the Moon" produced by Philip Meister and Maurice Edwards at The Cubiculo in New York City in March 1974. An unreleased recording of Purgatory is found in the Billy Rose Collection of the New York Public Library. A television version of "Purgatory" was featured on University Broadcast Lab on WNYC-TV in 1974.

Yellow Dog (Variety)

Gula Hund (English title: Yellow Dog) is a Swedish variety show that had its première the 5 July 1964 on Chinateatern in Stockholm. It was written by Hans Alfredsson and Tage Danielsson and directed by Tage. Both of the writers starred in various roles.
It was the second of "three dog-revues" (so called because they all have "dog" in their name). The first one being "Gröna Hund" (Green Dog) and the third and last one was "Svea hund".
Overview.
The show also starred Monica Zetterlund, Birgitta Andersson, Lissi Alandh, Sonya Hedenbratt, Gösta Ekman, Mille Schmidt, Stefan Böhm, Arild Eriksen, Gals and Pals and Gunnar Svenssons kvartett.
The show was built up by sketches and songs, often with satirical humour. Among the more famous sketches are "Flykten från Ålderdomshemmet" (The escape from the Old Folks Home) in which Hans Alfredsson played a senile old man, the ""Pitt"" number, where Birgitta Andersson took her husband, played by Gösta Ekman, to the doctor because he couldn't stop saying the word pitt (Swedish slang for penis) and the "Mahatma Ekman" number, in which Gösta Ekman portrayed a kind of guru who claimed that we "have to be friends with the things" only to have every object on stage work against him in a slapstick number.
The show also contained a number between Tage Danielsson and Lissi Alandh called "I Friska Naturn" (In The Healthy Nature) also known as Nature Morte. Dressed in 18th-century style clothing they sing a song about a picnic they have in the nature who has been destroyed by toxic and different kinds of pollution, among them a Nuclear Powerplant. Later in his life, Tage would become a spokesperson against pollution in general and Nuclear Power in particular.
It was filmed for television in 1966 and has since then been released on DVD and it is considered a Hasseåtage classic.
A shortened, English version called ""Yellow Dog"" was shown as Sweden's contribution to Montreux in 1965 were it created both a stir and a lot of raised eyebrows when it was shown.

Adelswärd (noble family)

Adelswärd was a Swedish noble family, introduced at Riddarhuset as noble family number 1707, which consists of two lines, related through female line.
The first line, called the Hultman line, is descended from Lars Hemmingsson (ca 1610-1688), tradesman in Norrköping. He is also male-line ancestor of the Swedish noble family Carlsköld. He was married 7 November 1641 in Norrköping to Maria Hansdotter (buried 2 March 1684 in Norrköping). Their son was the tradesman in Norrköping, Lorents Hultman (ca 1660-1702), who first was married 6 December 1685 in Norrköping to Johanna Bröms (born 15 January 1668, dead 19 March 1696), and then married ca 1698 to Margareta Karlsdotter (born 18 January 1680 in Norrköping, dead 2 January 1753 in Stockholm.
In his first marriage, he had the son Johan Hultman (born 8 November 1690 in Norrköping, dead 26 July 1729 at Forsmark in Forsmark), who was a rittmeister and was ennobled 20 December 1719 in Stockholm by Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden, together with his so-called "brother-in-law" (actually his cousin by marriage) Leonhard Keijser (see below). They were introduced at Riddarhuset 1720 as noble family number 1707. Johan Hultman, ennobled Adelswärd's wife Altea Silfverström (1700-1765), was daughter of Johan Silfverström (1660-1710) and Altea de Besche (born 1670), who in turn was daughter of Georg de Besche, ennobled de Besche (1641-1711) and Althea Bothler (1646-1704) (see below). Johan Hultman's (ennobled Adelswärd) son with Altea Silfverström, the titular governor Johan Adelswärd (1718-1785) was created a Swedish Baron 1770, and is the first member of the Baronial family Adelswärd.
Leonard Hultman's son in his second marriage, Karl Hultman, was ennobled Carlsköld.
The second line, called the Keijser line, is descended from the rittmeister Leonhard Keijser (born 1687 in Karlstad, dead 24 January 1756 at Länsö, Börstil, Uppland), who was ennobled, as mentioned above, with Johan Hultman 20 December 1719. His wife, Altéa Fredrika Meijer (dead 1759 or 1760), was a daughter of the tradesman in Liège, Conrad Meijer, and Anna Katarina de Besche, who in turn was daughter of Georg de Besche, ennobled de Besche (1641-1711) and Althea Bothler (1646-1704) (see above). The Keijser line became extinct with its founder.

HW Virginis

HW Virginis, abbreviated HW Vir, is an eclipsing binary system (of the Algol type) approximately 590 light-years away (based on the stellar properties and magnitudes: the Hipparcos trigonometric parallax measurement has too high an error value to be useful) in the constellation of Virgo. The system comprises an eclipsing B-type subdwarf star and red dwarf star. The two stars orbit each other every 0.116795 days.
Planetary system.
In addition, the system has two substellar companions in orbit around the binary: the inner companion HW Virginis c has a mass at least 8.47 times the mass of Jupiter and takes just over 9 years to complete an orbit. The outer companion HW virginis b takes 15.8 years to complete an orbit and has a mass at least 19.2 times Jupiter's mass. According to the definition used by the International Astronomical Union's Working Group on Extrasolar Planets, the inner companion would be classified as a planet, while the outer companion would be classified as a brown dwarf. However the discoverers note that the orbital configuration suggests that the objects formed as planets in a disc, and the formation of planets above the deuterium fusion limit has been predicted by computer models of giant planet formation.

Fabien Lefèvre (born 18 June 1982 in Orléans) is a United States slalom canoeist who has competed since the late 1980s. Fabien competed for France until 2013 when he became a resident of the United States. Competing in two Summer Olympics, he won two medals in the K-1 event with a silver in 2008 and a bronze in 2004.
Lefèvre also won thirteen medals at the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships with six golds (K-1: 2002, 2003; C-2 team: 2010, 2011; K-1 team: 2005, 2006), five silvers (C-2: 2010, 2011; K-1: 2005, K-1 team: 2010, 2011), and two bronzes (K-1 team: 2002, K-1: 2011).
He is the overall World Cup champion in K-1 from 2002. He also won two bronze medals at the European Championships in the K-1 team event.
Career.
Fabien Lefevre began kayaking at the age of 5. At the age of 20, he won the K-1 event at the 2002 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships in Bourg-Saint-Maurice. He backed up this result by winning the 2002 World Cup title. One year later he was able to defend the K-1 world title in Augsburg.
These victories made him the favorite for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. However, he was only able to capture bronze after touching a gate in both semifinal and final run. He recorded the fastest running time but the 4 penalty seconds pushed him down to third.
At the 2005 World Championships in Penrith, New South Wales he won a silver medal in the K-1 event, losing only to Fabian Dörfler. He won the K-1 team title, however, together with Benoît Peschier and Julien Billaut. He won the K-1 team gold again in 2006, this time joined by Julien Billaut and Boris Neveu. He finished 5th in the individual event in 2006 in a race where two winners were declared by the ICF jury (Julien Billaut and Stefano Cipressi).
In 2007 a serious wrist injury prevented him from taking part at the World Championships in Foz do Iguaçu, won by his compatriot Sébastien Combot.
He regained his place in the French team in 2008 and won the selection for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by defeating the reigning Olympic champion Benoît Peschier at the French trials. Lefèvre was third after the semifinal run and improved to silver medal position in the final. Benjamin Boukpeti, a friend of Lefèvre, won the first Olympic medal for Togo with a bronze, while Alexander Grimm took gold.
In late 2008, inspired by Michael Phelps, he decided to take up the double canoe discipline (C2) together with Denis Gargaud Chanut, while continuing to race in single kayak (K1) with the ambition to appear in both categories at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Lefèvre failed to medal at the 2009 World Championships in La Seu d'Urgell in either category though. The extreme fatigue he felt after the races made him doubt his project.
However, he continued in both categories in 2010 and ended the year with a silver medal in the C-2 event at the World Championships in Tacen. He also added a gold medal in the C-2 team event and a silver in the K-1 team event. A year later at the 2011 World Championships in Bratislava he made history by becoming the first slalom canoeist to win 4 medals at the same Championships.
The success, however, was followed by a disappointment in 2012 after failing to qualify for the Olympics in London in either category.

Electoral district of Ocean Reef

The Electoral district of Ocean Reef is a Legislative Assembly electorate in the state of Western Australia. The district is named for the outer northern Perth suburb of Ocean Reef which falls within its borders.
History.
Ocean Reef was created at the 2007 redistribution out of most of the Mindarie electorate and parts of Joondalup and Hillarys. Its creation reflected both the growth of the City of Wanneroo region which now required three full electorates (Wanneroo, Mindarie and Girrawheen), and the increase in the number of metropolitan seats in accordance with the new one vote one value legislation. 
Geography.
Ocean Reef extends from the Wanneroo-Joondalup coastal boundary southwards, taking in the suburbs of Burns Beach, Iluka, Kallaroo, Kinross, Mullaloo, Ocean Reef and most of Currambine.
In the redistribution of 2011, the suburb of Mindarie was moved from the district of Mindarie into the district of Ocean Reef, effective at the 2013 election. The district of Mindarie was renamed Butler as a result.

Trinidad Rapid Railway

The Trinidad Rapid Railway was a proposed passenger railway system in Trinidad and Tobago.
Project.
On April 11 2008 the TriniTrain consortium of Alstom Transport SA, Alstom T&T Ltd, Bouygues Construction and RATP Développement announced it had been selected by the government to plan and build two new passenger railway lines in Trinidad. WSP was advising the government on the routes.
In a meeting with Prime Minister Patrick Manning on 28 April 2009, Minister of Works & Transport, Colm Imbert said construction of the Trinidad Rapid Railway would commence in mid-2010, with the first train rolling out of the capital city approximately 36 to 39 months later as detailed by the National Infrastructure Development Company Limited (NIDCO).
In September 2010, the project was scrapped.
Lines.
The lines were planned to be constructed simultaneously in five sections, Westmoorings through Port of Spain to St Augustine, St Augustine to Arima, and Arima to Sangre Grande, Port of Spain to Chaguanas, and Chaguanas to San Fernando.
Consultants hired by the government investigated the alternative of taking the railway underground because of the expense of the acquisition of land, building elevated platforms and the congestion at the interchange taking traffic in and out of the capital.

Edgar Stillman Kelley

Edgar Stillman Kelley (April 14, 1857 – November 12, 1944) was an American composer, conductor, teacher, and writer on music. He is sometimes associated with the Indianist movement in American music.
Life.
Kelley was of New England stock, his ancestors having come to America from England before 1650. He himself was born in Sparta, Wisconsin. His mother was from a musical family, and herself was skilled in music; she became his first teacher. Kelley's own college career was interrupted by bouts of poor health. He was a talented artist and writer, but he decided to devote his life to music after a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's music for "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Consequently, he traveled to Chicago at 17, there to study with Clarence Eddy and Napoleon Ledochowski. Two years later he went to Stuttgart, where he studied organ, piano, and composition. His teachers there were Frederich Finck, Wilhelm Krüger, Wilhelm Speidel, and Max Seifriz. His friendship with Edward MacDowell began in Stuttgart, and later Kelley worked at the MacDowell Colony.
Kelley graduated from the conservatory in Stuttgart in 1880, and performed around Europe for a time with a number of orchestras. Upon his return to the United States, he came west to San Francisco, where he worked as a church organist and was a music critic for the "Examiner". He also became active as a composer, writing incidental music for a production of "Macbeth" that garnered him much attention. An interest in theater drew him to New York City in 1886, and there he married Jessie Gregg on July 23, 1891; the two then returned to California for four more years, during which time Kelley composed, conducted, lectured, and taught. In 1896 the couple returned to New York, where Edgar was hired to conduct an operetta company. He also taught, at the New York College of Music and New York University, and in 1901 replaced Horatio Parker for a year at Yale when the latter went on sabbatical. The following year saw the Kelleys move to Berlin, and for eight years they lived and worked in Europe, lecturing, teaching, conducting, and performing in an attempt to expand European interest in American music. Kelley, though, wished to spend more time composing, and in 1910 took a post at the Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, where he would remain until his death.
Kelley and his wife divided their time between the Western College and the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music; Kelley taught composition there, and later served as dean of the Department of Composition and Orchestration. Among his pupils was C. Hugo Grimm, who would himself later lead the department. His wife lectured there as well. The couple retired in 1934 but continued to travel while maintaining a house in Oxford. Kelley died in Oxford in 1944.
Music.
Kelley was a Romanticist in the vein of Horatio Parker, George Whitefield Chadwick, and Arthur Foote, and brought much of his German training to bear in his compositions. Even so, he was always interested in bringing non-Western influences into his work. For his orchestral suite "Aladdin", one of his early successes, he studied the music he heard in San Francisco's Chinatown, and used oboes, muted trumpets, and mandolins to imitate Chinese instruments. His "New England Symphony" is based on themes found in bird songs (the "andante" portion), as well as American Indian and Puritan music. For incidental music to a New York production of "Ben-Hur" in 1899, he based his composition on Greek modes. This music was to go on to become his most popular work; it is said to have been performed some five thousand times in English-speaking countries by 1930.
Kelley's best-known composition was an oratorio, "The Pilgrim's Progress", composed on a text by Elizabeth Hodgkinson and based on the eponymous text by John Bunyan. It was first performed in Cincinnati in 1918, and was frequently revived thereafter, both in the United States and in England. He also wrote program music, including orchestral suites after both "The Pit and the Pendulum" and "Alice in Wonderland"; his first symphony was based on "Gulliver's Travels", and depicted Lemuel Gulliver's adventures in Lilliput. His output also included numerous pieces of chamber music.
Kelley had very definite ideas about American music and its creation, and was not shy about sharing them. Expressing his views, he once wrote that the American composer should apply the universal principles of his art to the local and special elements of the subject-matter as they appeal to him, and then, consciously or unconsciously, manifest his individuality, which will involve the expression of mental traits and moral tendencies peculiar to his European ancestry, as we find them modified by the new American environment.
A good deal of Kelley's music was published by Arthur Farwell's Wa-Wan Press in the early years of the twentieth century.
Other work.
In addition to his work as a composer, Kelley was active as a writer on music, continuing after his early experience with the "Examiner" in San Francisco. Included in his output were a number of books, including "Chopin the Composer" and a work on Beethoven. His important article "The Bach-Schumann Suites for Cello" appears in "Music: A Monthly Magazine" for November 1892, 612-19; he owned a unique copy of the six suites (now lost?). The most notable of his composition pupils was Wallingford Riegger; among his other students were Frederick Ayres, Joseph W. Clokey, James G. Heller, Rupert Hughes, W. Otto Miessner and Alexander Russell.
Miami University maintains an archive devoted to Kelley and his wife; it contains correspondence, music manuscripts, books, and other material related to the composer's life and career. In addition, his house and studio, built in 1916, remains on the Miami University campus, and is made available for the use of incoming faculty and administration.
Recordings.
Little of Kelley's music has been committed to disc. The "Aladdin" fantasy for orchestra has been recorded as part of an anthology of American orchestral music, and pianist Brian Kovach has recorded his complete output of piano music; both recordings were released by Albany Records.

Let It Go (Tim McGraw song)

"Let It Go" is a song written by Aimee Mayo, Bill Luther and Tom Douglas, and performed by American country music singer Tim McGraw. It was released in July 2008 as the sixth single and title track from his album "Let It Go". It was his forty-second Top 40 hit on the "Billboard" country charts.
Content.
The song is a mid-tempo which describes a man's observation on his life and the "demons" that have been causing him personal discomfort. Ultimately, he convinces himself to "let it go" and improve his outlook on life.
Reception.
The song received a "thumbs down" review from the country music site The 9513. Reviewer Brady Vercher said, "The song avoids becoming a motivational sermon by having the narrator focus inward, upon himself, but all we learn is that he's trying to put the skeletons in his closet behind him and move on. Ultimately, without any sort of supporting story, the lyric is[…]generic enough to be applicable to nearly any situation." He also said that McGraw gave an "uninspired" vocal performance. Allmusic critic Thom Jurek described the song favorably in his review of the album, calling it "the real shock" of the album and saying that it "offer a message of threadbare hope in the face of adversity. In the grain of his voice, you can hear the determination to talk and walk from the place of redemption rather than the terrain of suffering. He's singing to convince himself as much as he is the listener."
Chart positions.
Before the release of "Let It Go", McGraw had reportedly announced in concert that he was planning to release a new album late in 2008. However, Curb Records decided to delay the album's release, and instead released "Let It Go" as the sixth single from "Let It Go". The song debuted at number 59 on the Hot Country Songs charts dated for August 2, 2008, reaching a peak of number 2 on the chart week of December 6 and holding that position for two weeks.

The Fulton County Courthouse is a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Rochester, Indiana, United States.
It is a prominent building in the Rochester Downtown Historic District. It is a Richardsonian Romanesque Fulton County Courthouse.
The limestone courthouse, which was already on the National Register as of September 22, 2000, is located on Ninth Street. Four different memorials are on its grounds: one for the Pottawatomies' Trail of Death, a cornerstone for the Rochester College, and two war memorials. Although most of the buildings in the district are constructed of brick, after the construction of the courthouse, with its rusticated limestone construction, it is believed that other buildings were renovated to match the courthouse using faux stone that was cemented to their brick structures. Limestone is also used on the name blocks of buildings. The historic fire department has an engraved limestone name block above its door. The city hall not only has a similar limestone name block, but the right and left bays of the hall have limestone diamonds above them.

Alexis-Michel Eenens

Alexis Michel Eenens (29 June 1805 in Brussels – 9 January 1883 in Schaerbeek) was a Belgian lieutenant-general, military historian, and politician.
Biography.
Family life.
Eenens was the son of a wealthy merchant in textiles, Louis Eenens, and Anne-Marie Carlier. He was born in Brussels when Belgium was annexed to the French Empire, and the French Republican Calendar was still in force, and his birthday is therefore properly "10 messidor An XIII". He married Adélaïde Barbe Joseph Gilain in Tienen on 8 August 1869. They had one daughter, Thérèse Marie Euphrasie Josèphe, who married a future "procureur-général" at the Belgian Supreme Court, Georges-Marie "Viscount" Terlindenand [http://gw2.geneanet.org/index.php3?b=lard&lang=fr;pz=felix;nz=terlinden;ocz=0;p=alexis+michel;n=eenens
Military and political career.
He was admitted to the "Artillerie- en Genieschool" (Artillery and Engineering School) of the army of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in Delft on 15 July 1825 as a cadet. On 20 November 1828 he was promoted to sergeant-major and allowed to study at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. He was promoted to second lieutenant in the artillery and assigned to the 5th battalion Militia Artillery at Namur on 5 January 1830, on the eve of the Belgian Revolution.
Eenens joined the revolutionaries by taking part in a mutiny of the Namur garrison in September 1830. As a reward he was breveted lieutenant by the Belgian Provisional Government and soon after promoted to captain. Stationed in Antwerp, he refused to defect to the Dutch with General Van der Smissen on 25 March 1831. He then joined the Belgian troops at Leuven and helped to defend that city in August.
In 1834 he killed another Belgian captain in a duel on the battlefield of Waterloo. He was acquitted by the court martial, because Belgium at that time did not have a law against duelling. That same year he tried to resign his commission, but was not allowed to, because he had promised to serve ten years after his admission to the Royal military academy.
In 1839, at the suggestion of King Leopold I of Belgium, he took a leave of absence to act as an observer in Egypt. He explored commercial possibilities for Belgium and visited Ethiopia (then known as "Abyssinia") together with the Belgian consul in Alexandria to try to establish a Belgian colonial outpost on the west coast of the Red Sea. However, illness forced him to return to Belgium in December 1840.
He was promoted to major in 1842 and to lieutenant-colonel in 1845. Then in 1846 he tried to go into politics as a Liberal Party representative. As this was an oppositional party, the king put him on non-active status. He was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives on 8 June 1847, but a new law prohibiting military officers to sit in parliament forced him to give up his seat in May 1848. He then reentered active duty.
Eenens was promoted to colonel on 24 June 1853, and put in charge of an artillery regiment in Tournai. On 8 May 1859 he was promoted to major-general and given the command of the First Artillery Brigade. He also became a member of the Munitions Committee and other advisory commissions. On 24 June 1866 he was promoted to lieutenant-general and Inspector-general of the Belgian Artillery. On 15 July 1870 he was put in charge of the army at Antwerp where he became military governor (and at the same time "aide de camp" of King Leopold II of Belgium) on 6 October 1870.
In view of the dangerous international situation (the Franco-Prussian War had just started), Eenens now pleaded for strengthening the Belgian defenses, but the Cabinet of prime minister Jules Malou opposed this, supported by the Catholic party of Charles Woeste. Disgusted, Eenens retired from active service on 18 May 1873. He remained aide de camp of the king, who conferred the "Grand Cordon" of the Order of Leopold on him.
Scholarly work.
Besides his military career Eenens also pursued a more scholarly career. In the 1840s he promoted the involvement of the Belgian army in the agricultural development of the poorer parts of Belgium. In 1844 he published "Notes sur le défrichement de la Campine par l'armée", a pamphlet containing his proposals, but his ideas were rejected by the agricultural establishment.
He also became a prolific writer on military history, specializing in the history of the Belgian Revolution. In 1875 he published "Documents historiques sur l'origine du royaume de Belgique. Les conspirations militaires de 1831 (Bruxelles, 1875, 2 vols.)", which caused quite a furore, because he accused a number of prominent people of treasonous behavior during the revolution, in favor of the Orangist cause. This caused a fervent polemic, both with Belgian politicians and historians, and with Dutch military historians, because he also accused the future king William II of the Netherlands (then commander-in-chief of the Dutch forces that attempted to suppress the revolution of 1830) of violating an armistice. Because of the scandal this polemic caused, the king asked him to relent, and when he demurred, relieved him of his function as aide de camp.
Eenens also became involved in the controversy about the accusations of cowardice the British military historian William Siborne had leveled at the Dutch-Belgian troops at the Battle of Waterloo in his 1844 book " History of the War in France and Belgium in 1815". The Belgian general Renard had in 1855 already attempted a refutation as had the Dutch general Willem Jan Knoop in 1846. Eenens published his own ""Dissertation sur la participation des troupes des Pays-Bas à la campagne de 1815 en Belgique"" in 1879. This critical assessment of Siborne's work is still relevant.
Eenens died in Schaarbeek on 9 January 1883.

Duder Regional Park

Duder Regional Park is a regional park situated on the coast to the east of Auckland city, New Zealand.
History.
The park was created in 1995 after the sale of the land by the Duder family to the Auckland Regional Council. Prior to the sale the land had been farmed by descendants of Thomas Duder for about 130 years. The land was purchased in 1866 from the original Maori owners Ngai Tai who had historically built a pa on the headland.
An extra 13.7 ha was added in 2010 to prevent coast development obstructing views from the park.
Description.
The park is a working farm bounded to the west by Duders Beach. It is situated on a headland and offers commanding views of the Hauraki Gulf. There is limited native bush as most of the land is grassed. There are no designated picnic areas and facilities are limited.
Small numbers of the endangered tuturiwhatu (New Zealand dotterel) breed on shell banks south of the park. This area is not accessible to the public.

<doc id="18833311" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18833311" title="Wasque">
Wasque

Wasque ("way-squee") or Wasque Beach is a nature reserve on Chappaquiddick Island, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The site was established as a reservation for the public in 1967 and is one of five conservation areas on "the Vineyard" managed by the Trustees of Reservations. Wasque contains a sandy strand the "Boston Globe" calls "a magnificent beach." "Travel + Leisure" named Wasque Beach the number one beach in New England and WHDH-TV reports "It's pristine, serene, and rain or shine, it's a beach-goers' delight." Off the shore of Wasque Beach is Katama Bay, "a vast and pristine salt water bay that includes many acres of productive shellfish beds."
Ecology.
Wasque has a sand barrens ecosystem. One of a number of such habitats in isolated locations from Maine to New Jersey, the reservation's landscape and geography were formed by ancient outwash deposits from glacial till. The free-draining, acidic, dry, and sandy soil sustains coastal heathlands, oak and pitch pine woodlands, and sandplain grasslands. Wasque is home to such species as Beach Plum, Bearberry, Blackberry, Black Huckleberry, Blue Toadflax, Bluets, Chokeberry, Dwarf Cinquefoil, Golden Heather, Late Lowbush Blueberry, Nantucket Shadbush, Rockrose, and Yellow Stargrass. These areas are "globally rare communities" and only maintained through relatively intensive land management that includes domesticated animals grazing the grass, mechanical mowing and clearing of vegetation, and even controlled burning.
The reservation has a number of rare animal species that depend on the conditions of these habitats; in 2004 "The Boston Globe" said that the Wasque Reservation is "a great place for fishing and birdwatching". Observers can spot blue herons, egrets, ducks, and migrating shorebirds that can be found in the marshes. Ospreys can be seen swooping down to pluck fish from the Atlantic Ocean. Butterfly watchers can see monarchs, sulphur butterflies, and red admirals that stop here to drink nectar from wildflowers before continuing their southward migration.
History.
Algonquian people camped at this site in warm weather; the name is said to come from "wannasque", an Algonquian word meaning "the ending". European settlement came to this part of Chappaquiddick Island in 1750 or later. Several 19th century land speculation proposals never came to fruition. "Chappaquiddick-by-the-Sea," one failed concept for land development, would have included a grid of 750 quarter-acre parcels, broad avenues, public parks, and yacht facilities. In 1967, when the property was purchased for the public, there were only a few homes in the area.
Visiting.
Relatively remote, this "little-known" beach and nature reserve is about 70 miles south of Boston off the coast of Cape Cod. Martha's Vinyard is a short Steamship Authority ferry ride from mainland Cape Cod, out of Falmouth or Woods Hole. Bicycles and motor vehicles may be transported on the ferry for additional fees. A ferry from Edgartown on the Vineyard allows one to get to Chappaquiddick. The property is open 24 hours a day all year. Due to severe beach erosion at Wasque Point, one is no longer allowed to take vehicles over the sand to Wasque from adjacent Cape Poge Wildlife Refuge. Formerly this was allowed except for occasional summer closures to protect the nest sites of rare shorebirds.
Wasque is a great place for recreational fishing. Recent reports of fishing off Wasque Beach have mentioned bonito that were reeled in at the Wasque rip and Menemsha jetties. Bluefish and 10-15 lbs. Striped bass have been reported as well. In some years, the waters off Wasque Beach have been "hot with both game species." At times, dedicated anglers have come to the Wasque just to sit in their vehicles “watching the water for signs” that fishing conditions were favorable.

SS Pennsylvanian

SS "Pennsylvanian" was a cargo ship built in 1913 for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. During World War I she was requisitioned by the United States Navy and commissioned as USS "Pennsylvanian" (ID-3511) in September 1918, but renamed two months later to USS "Scranton". After her Navy service, her original name of "Pennsylvanian" was restored.
"Pennsylvanian" was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened. "Pennsylvanian" was one of the first two steamships to travel eastbound through the canal when it opened in August 1914. During World War I, as both USS "Pennsylvanian" and USS "Scranton", the ship carried cargo and animals to France, and returned American troops after the Armistice in 1918.
After her Navy service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, and shipped cargo on New York – Caribbean routes and transatlantic routes. In mid-July 1944, "Pennsylvanian" was scuttled as part of the breakwater for one of the Mulberry artificial harbors built to support the Normandy Invasion.
Design and construction.
In September 1911, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for four new cargo ships—, , , and "Pennsylvanian". The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum cost of $640,000 each. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Pennsylvanian", including financing costs, was $70.35 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $716,000.
"Pennsylvanian" (Maryland Steel yard no. 127) was the final ship built under the original contract. She was launched on 29 March 1913, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in June. "Pennsylvanian" was , and was in length and abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of and a storage capacity of . "Pennsylvanian" had a single steam engine powered by oil-fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller at a speed of .
Early career.
When "Pennsylvanian" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. "Pennsylvanian" sailed in this service on the west side of North America.
After the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled with the fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. "Pennsylvanian", on the west side of the canal when it opened, was one of the first two eastbound steamers to traverse the canal during her trip to New York. In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that "Pennsylvanian" would sail on a San Francisco – Panama Canal – Boston route, sailing opposite of , "Honolulan", and sister ship "Washingtonian". When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including "Pennsylvanian", returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.
"Pennsylvanian"s exact movements during 1916 and 1917 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and managanese ore. However, when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the entire American-Hawaiian fleet, including "Pennsylvanian", was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB), which then returned the ships for operation by American-Hawaiian.
U.S. Navy service.
On 13 September 1918, "Pennsylvanian" was transferred to the U.S. Navy at New York and commissioned USS "Pennsylvanian" (ID-3511) the same day. Assigned to the Navy's Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), "Pennsylvanian" loaded a general cargo and sailed for Brest, France, on 30 September. She arrived there on 15 October and sailed for La Pallice the next day, where she unloaded her cargo before departing for New York on 5 November.
Arriving at New York on 15 November, four days after the Armistice, "Pennsylvanian" was refitted as an animal transport ship, which, among other things, required the building of ramps and stalls for the animals. Sometime in November, probably during her refit, she was renamed USS "Scranton", becoming the first U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the Pennsylvania town. "Scranton" sailed for France on 12 December, arriving at Saint-Nazaire on 29 December, and returning to New York on 29 January 1919.
On 5 February, "Scranton" was transferred from the NOTS to the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force, and began conversion to a troop transport to carry American personnel home from France. While sailing to France to begin her first troop-carrying duties in late March, "Scranton" suffered damage to her rudder and was disabled east of New York. Navy transport responded to "Scranton"s distress call, and attempted to take "Scranton" under tow. During the day on 28 March, "Scranton" attempted to run a towline to "El Sol" by sending a launch in the rolling seas, but it capsized, drowning three men. "El Sol" stood by "Scranton" for over 40 hours until minesweeper arrived and took "Scranton" under tow. "Penguin" and "Scranton" arrived in New York on 3 April, where "Scranton" entered drydock to undergo repairs.
After repairs, "Scranton" made three roundtrips to France and carried some 6,000 troops and passengers home to the United States before she was decommissioned on 19 July. The ship was handed over to the USSB for return to American-Hawaiian, who restored her original name.
Interwar years.
"Pennsylvanian" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, "Pennsylvanian" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful career. One incident of note occurred on 28 November 1930, when "Pennsylvanian" hit a Southern Pacific ferry near Goat Island (present-day Yerba Buena Island) in a dense fog in San Francisco Bay. "Pennsylvanian" hit the stern of the ferry and caused damage to the ferry's superstructure and destroyed about of the ferry's railing. No one on either ship was injured.
Other hints of "Pennsylvanian"s activities throughout the rest of her career can be found from contemporary newspaper reports. In October 1929, the "Los Angeles Times" reported on a shipment that included 2,500 to 3,000 radio sets among "Pennsylvanian"s of cargo. In March 1938, "The Christian Science Monitor" reported that "Pennsylvanian"s captain, C. M. Bamforth, had temporarily turned the deck of the cargo ship into a boatyard to build a catboat for his son in Swampscott, Massachusetts. Bamforth laid the keel while in San Francisco, bought copper rivets for the hull planking in Portland, Oregon, and began painting the boat after "Pennsylvanian" had traversed the Panama Canal. He expected to have the boat finished when "Pennsylvanian" arrived in Boston on 22 April.
In October the same year, "Pennsylvanian" delivered of steel parts for the Hale Telescope then under construction at the Palomar Observatory outside of San Diego, California. The ship had picked up the $375,000 cargo in Philadelphia before sailing for San Diego.
World War II.
At some point after the United States entered World War II, "Pennsylvanian" was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA), but, as with her pre-U.S. Navy service in World War I, she continued to be operated by American-Hawaiian. From July to September 1942, "Pennsylvanian" sailed between New York and Caribbean ports, calling at Trinidad, Key West, Hampton Roads, Guantánamo Bay, and Cristóbal. In January 1943, "Pennsylvanian" called at Bandar Abbas, Iran, on the Persian Gulf, but had returned to Caribbean sailings again by March.
Between May and September 1943, "Pennsylvanian" made four transatlantic crossings between New York and Liverpool, making intermediate stops in Loch Ewe and Methil while in the United Kingdom. The cargo ship made two New York – Guantánamo Bay roundtrips between September and December before resuming transatlantic sailings. After two New York – Liverpool roundtrips between late December 1943 and April 1944, "Pennsylvanian" left the United States for the final time on 19 May 1944, arriving in Liverpool on 2 June. She called at the British ports of Methil, Loch Ewe, Clyde, and Milford Haven in late June and early July, and, sailing from Barry in mid July, "Pennsylvanian" arrived at Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, France. There she was scuttled as part of the breakwater for the Mulberry artificial harbor built to support the Normandy Invasion.
In March 1945, the WSA offered a payment of $565,910 to American-Hawaiian for "Pennsylvanian" as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had either been sunk, scuttled (like "Pennsylvanian"), or were to be retained by the government.

Bear's Den

Bear's Den (also called by the name of its most outstanding landmark, Bear's Den Falls) is a nature reserve in New Salem, Massachusetts. The reservation is close to the Quabbin Reservoir and is owned by the Trustees of Reservations.
Name.
The property takes its name from a large black bear once shot here "though more romantic -- yet unsubstantiated -- stories exist" according to the Trustees of Reservations.
Description.
The Middle Branch of the Swift River passes through the steep granite cliffs of Bear's Den reservation on its way to the Quabbin Reservoir. The gorge is 75' deep and rimmed with hemlock. At one point, a change in elevation creates a waterfall. According to one description:
So as you walk the 150 yard path from the road and bear left through the jagged opening in the ridge, you have a limited sense of the waterfall being there until you step through and into this amphitheater of Mother Nature. Once inside, you sense an isolation from the rest of the world. It's a great experience and unique for a location so close to the road.
A short path leads from Neilson Road into the reservation and immediately splits into a leftward path towards the gorge and a rightward path leading to a small cave (the eponymous "Bear's Den") and a stream. These trail is less than one quarter mile of easy hiking. The reservation is "a tranquil spot for hiking and picnicking." Seasonal hunting is allowed on the property subject to all state and local laws.
Camping, fires, and unleashed dogs are prohibited. Swimming is discouraged. Bear's Den reservation is open from dusk until dawn. The property abuts watershed land and wetlands to the west connecting to the Quabbin Reservoir and owned by the Metropolitan District Commission.
History.
Metacomet, sachem of the Wampanoag Indians and their war chief during King Philip's War, is believed to have met here with neighboring other Nipmuck chieftains in 1675 to plan attacks the nearby English towns of Deerfield, Hadley and Northampton ( see note). Much later, the falls provided waterpower for grist mills in the area as water was carried by a sluice box, through a channel cut in the eastern cliff, and onto an overshot water wheel. Trustees of Reservations first acquired the property through the 1968 bequest of Mrs. Grais Poole Burrage. In 1988, Mrs. Dorothy Fittz donated additional land.

2008 California Golden Bears football team

The 2008 California Golden Bears football team represented the University of California, Berkeley in the college football 2008–2009 season. They played their home games at California Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, California and are coached by Jeff Tedford. California hosted Michigan State to begin the season on August 30, 2008 and closed the season at home against the University of Washington on December 6, 2008. In addition to the slate of nine conference games, five at home and four on the road, the Golden Bears traveled to College Park, Maryland to play the Maryland Terrapins, while having hosted Michigan State and Colorado State.
The Bears finished the regular season in fourth place in the Pac-10 and accepted a bid to the 2008 Emerald Bowl on December 27, where they defeated the Miami Hurricanes. The team improved on its 2007 season record of 7–6 to 9–4 and spent most of the season unranked, breaking into the AP Top 25 three times only to get knocked out each time following a loss. The Bears were finally ranked #25 in the Coaches' Poll and just missed getting into the AP Top 25 in January 2009.
Preseason.
The aftermath of Cal's tumble from potentially being ranked in 2007 led Tedford to declare open competition on all positions. This included at quarterback, where Tedford had come under extreme criticism from the media and Golden Bears fans alike for his decision-making the previous year. Both Nate Longshore and Kevin Riley appeared to be at a standstill through fall practice. But in a surprise move, the younger and less experienced Riley was named the starter for the season opener. However, Tedford indicated that the quarterback competition was not over, and that Longshore would also see action against Michigan State (he would appear in the second quarter).
Cal's offseason also was noted by the Kevin Hart controversy, where the small town offensive linemen would claim he had been recruited by the Golden Bears, although the athletic department claimed never to be involved with him. Hart would later admit he made the whole thing up.
Game notes.
Michigan State.
The Bears had last played the Spartans in Michigan in 2002, defeating them 46–22 in Tedford's first year as head coach. The two teams had only played each other three times in all before their 2008 meeting, with the Spartans winning the other two contests.
Both teams were scoreless until a blocked Spartans punt resulted in a Bears touchdown in the first quarter. Cal scored again on a field goal by freshman kicker David Seawright in the second quarter. Michigan State responded when Otis Wiley intercepted a Nate Longshore pass and returned it for a touchdown, while Cal was able to counter with a touchdown run by Jahvid Best prior to the end of the first half.
The second half saw both teams score back and forth. The Spartans struck first with a touchdown run by Javon Ringer, followed by Cal QB Kevin Riley connecting with Cameron Morrah for a touchdown. Ringer made his second touchdown run of the game in the fourth quarter, while Riley made his second touchdown pass of the game to Will Ta'ufo'ou. After a Spartans field goal, freshman running back Shane Vereen scored on an 81-yard touchdown run that gave the Bears their final score of the game. The Spartans countered with a touchdown pass from Brian Hoyer to Mark Dell to get within 7 points and had a chance to tie the game with seconds left, but Hoyer threw four straight incompletions from midfield.
Longshore, who lost the starting quarterback job to Riley, threw for 62 yards with 2 interceptions. Riley threw for 202 yards with 2 touchdowns. The game marked the first time that two Cal running backs had completed over 100 yards rushing since the 2006 Holiday Bowl, with Best at 111 yards and Vereen at 101, respectively. Spartans quarterback Hoyer finished with 321 yards passing, including a touchdown and an interception. Ringer, who completed 1,447 yards rushing during the 2007 season, was held to 81 yards, which included 2 touchdowns.
Washington State.
The Cougars hosted the Bears in Pullman, Washington for the first conference game of the season for both teams as well as first year Cougars head coach Paul Wulff. Cal scored early, with Jahvid Best breaking free for an 80-yard touchdown run on the Bears' first possession. This was followed by an interception by Syd'Quan Thompson deep in Washington State territory, setting up a touchdown pass from Kevin Riley to Sean Young. Shane Vereen made a 39-yard touchdown run on the next possession for the Bears' third touchdown of the first quarter. A Cougar field goal would prove to be their only score for the game.
The Cougars had another chance at scoring in the second quarter, but had a field goal blocked that linebacker Zack Follett was able to return for a 65-yard touchdown. Riley was able to run in for a touchdown from 27 yards out, while Thompson made an 89-yard interception that set up another Best touchdown.
After the half, Nate Longshore led the Bears in the third quarter. The Cougars were intercepted in the Cal red zone, setting up an 86-yard touchdown run by Best. This marked the first time that Cal had two runs of more than 80 yards in a single game, as well as in a single season.
Cal used its commanding lead in the fourth quarter to give more of its backup players some experience. Following a touchdown by sophomore running back Tracy Slocum, freshman quarterback Brock Mansion was able to take his first career snap. An interception of a Cougars pass in WSU territory gave Mansion the opportunity to make his first rushing touchdown for the final score of the game.
Cal produced 505 total yards of offense (114 passing and 391 rushing) and allowed only 167 total yards (110 passing and 57 rushing) to the Cougars, who committed four turnovers. The game marked the first time since 1921 and 1923 that the Bears had won back to back games at Pullman. It was the Cougars' worst loss since a 1976 loss to UCLA 62–3 and the first time that WSU opened the season with two losses since 1999. Best had exactly 200 yards rushing on 14 carries for three touchdowns, the most by a Cal player since Justin Forsett had 235 against New Mexico State in 2005. He also became the first player since J.J. Arrington to start the season with consecutive 100-yard rushing games. The win enabled the Bears to get back into the AP Top 25 at #23.
Maryland.
Cal headed east for its second road game in a row in the first ever meeting between the Bears and the Terrapins with a noon kickoff. The Terrapins jumped out to an early lead and never relinquished it, with Da’Rel Scott scoring a rushing touchdown on their first possession. Kevin Riley was intercepted on the ensuing Cal possession, setting up another touchdown run by Scott. Terrapins quarterback Chris Turner threw a touchdown pass to open the second quarter. The Bears were limited to a pair of field goals in the first half, with a possible third one from 25 yards out bouncing off the left upright in the closing seconds of the second quarter. Maryland had only scored 21 points combined in their first two games.
In the third quarter, Cal recovered a Maryland fumble, but failed to score and turned the ball over on downs. Maryland extended its lead to 28–6 on a 28-yard touchdown strike from Turner to Darrius Heyward-Bey. Riley was sacked three times. Cal was shut out of the end zone until the fourth quarter, when Riley connected with Cameron Morrah. The Terrapins recovered the ensuing onside kick and was able to respond with a touchdown for their final score of the game. Riley threw two more touchdown passes to bring the Bears within 8 points, but Maryland recovered the ensuing onside kicks and Turner was able to end the game by taking three straight knees.
Jahvid Best, coming from back to back games with over 100 yards rushing, was held to 25 on ten carries, with the Bears producing only 38 net rushing yards. Riley passed for 423 yards on 58 attempts, a school record for the most pass attempts. Terrapins quarterback Turner passed for 156 yards and two touchdowns, while running backs Scott and Davin Meggett rushed for 87 and two touchdowns, and 82 yards and a touchdown, respectively. The Bears also gave up five sacks, the most since October 1, 2005 against Arizona. Humidity was cited as the biggest adjustment that Cal failed to make more so than the time change and Maryland's performance in its first two games. The loss brings the Bears' record to 3–7 in its last ten trips to the East Coast and also snapped a ten-game winning streak in the month of September.
Colorado State.
Although Cal struggled on pass offense and Cal's two running backs both committed a fumble early on, the defense and special teams put Cal on the board early in the first half. A Rams punt was blocked and Bryant Nnabuife ran it in for a touchdown, his second of the season. In the same quarter Cal's Brett Johnson intercepted Colorado State's Billy Farris' pass for a 43-yard touchdown. 
In the second quarter Riley threw an 11-yard pass to Nyan Boateng for the score after a pass interference call on Colorado State gave Cal a first down. The defense was able to shut out Colorado State for another quarter.
In the third quarter Riley was replaced with Nate Longshore who was unable to produce any offense although running backs Jahvid Best and Shane Vereen were consistently gaining first downs. However Cal's special teams struck again as Syd'Quan Thompson ran a punt return for a touchdown.
In the fourth quarter, Cal's offense finally clicked when Longshore hit Jeremy Ross for a 11-yard touchdown and Cameron Morrah for another 16-yard touchdown. The Rams avoided being shut out with a 1-yard touchdown run by John Mosure that followed a long pass by backup quarterback Klay Kubiak. The final score was 42–7.
In addition to the struggles on offense, Cal's Jahvid Best walked off the field after dislocating his elbow following a tackle. X-rays showed that there were no fractures and an MRI revealed no ligament damage. Cal's Rulon Davis left after half-time with an undisclosed foot injury.
Arizona State.
The Bears resumed conference play at home against the Sun Devils following a week off. Nate Longshore started for the Bears after Jeff Tedford had him and Kevin Riley compete for the starting position during the week. Cal took an early lead with a field goal in the first quarter followed by a touchdown pass from Longshore to LaReylle Cunningham that resulted from a fumble on the Sun Devils' first possession. Longshore threw an interception in the closing minutes of the first quarter, but the Sun Devils were unable to capitalize on it. The Bears struck again in the second quarter with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Morrah, to which the Sun Devils responded to with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Rudy Carpenter to Kyle Williams.
Cal scored first in the second half, when Longshore connected with Nyan Boateng for a touchdown. Cal was able to block a field goal attempt by Arizona State, but was penalized for jumping on the line, resulting in a first down. This set up the Sun Devils' final score of the game on an 8-yard run by Keegan Herring. The Bears defense was able to shut out the Sun Devils in the fourth quarter, intercepting Carpenter for a second time and forcing a fumble that forced them to punt. A Sun Devils field goal attempt in the final minute of the quarter missed. Cal only made one first down in the fourth quarter and spent the rest of the time successfully running out the clock.
Longshore finished with 198 yards, including three touchdowns and an interception, moving him up to fifth place on the Cal career touchdown list with 46. Running back Shane Vereen, stepping in for an injured Jahvid Best, had 93 yards rushing. Tight end Cameron Morrah caught his fourth touchdown pass of the season, the most by a tight end since Garrett Cross in 2004. Carpenter finished with 165 yards passing, including one touchdown pass and two picks. He injured his ankle in the final minutes and had to leave the game on crutches. The loss marks the Sun Devils' first three-game losing streak since Dennis Erickson's tenure as head coach. The victory allowed the Bears to break into the Coaches' Poll at #22 and AP Poll at #25 following a bye week.
Arizona.
The Bears put their new #25 ranking on the line against the Wildcats on the road, where they had lost in 2006, with Longshore getting his second start in a row for the season. Cal capitalized on a fumble by Arizona running back Nic Grigsby which set up a short pass from Longshore to Verran Tucker. The Wildcats responded in the second quarter with two touchdown runs in a row by freshman running back Keola Antolin of 20- and 11-yards, respectively. The Bears tied it up with a 67-yard by Jahvid Best, who played his first game since dislocating his left shoulder three weeks prior against Colorado State. Cal went ahead with an 18-yard touchdown reception by Cameron Morrah and a field goal to take a 24–14 lead at the half.
The Wildcats came storming back in the third quarter, starting with a 56-yard touchdown pass from Willie Tuitama to Mike Thomas. Antolin rushed for a touchdown for his third of the night, while Longshore was intercepted by Devin Ross less than a minute later for a 21-yard touchdown. Tuitama then hit Rob Gronkowski for a 35-yard touchdown and the final score of the game. By comparison, the Bears were only able to score on a lone field goal. Kevin Riley stepped in for Longshore during the fourth quarter but was unable to lead the Bears to a comeback, and both teams failed to score.
Best finished with 107 yards rushing, while Antolin ran for 149 yards, marking the first time that Cal had allowed a rusher to go for over 100 in the season. Longshore threw for 218 yards, including two touchdowns and one pick, while Riley threw for 97 yards and one interception. Tuitama threw for 225 yards, including two touchdowns and one interception, and was sacked four times. Wildcats receiver Mike Thomas had 104 receiving yards. The game marked the first time the Bears had allowed more than 40 points since UCLA had scored 47 at home on October 8, 2005.
UCLA.
The Bruins led the series, 49–28–1, on the Golden Bears. Kevin Riley started for the Bears, his first since nearly a month before against Colorado State on September 27. The Bruins took their only lead of the game at the beginning of the second quarter by managing to block a punt attempt by Bryan Anger and recovering the ball in the end zone to go up 7–3. On the ensuing possession Jahvid Best was able to break free for 34-yard run, the only offensive touchdown in the first half for the Bears. Marcus Ezeff then intercepted a pass by Bruins quarterback Kevin Craft which he was able to return for a 69-yard touchdown. Both teams then traded field goals into the fourth quarter. After getting a stop on a fake Bruins punt attempt, which nearly converted a 4th and 23 with a 22-yard pass, Riley hit Nyan Boateng for a 53-yard touchdown. Michael Mohamed then intercepted a Craft pass for a 19-yard score. Riley threw his second touchdown pass of the game on a ten-yard strike to Cameron Morrah. UCLA got in the final score of the game when backup quarterback Chris Forcier threw a nine-yard pass to Dominique Johnson, which was set up by a kickoff return by wide receiver Terrence Austin for 81 yards.
The victory continued Cal's win streak against UCLA at Memorial Stadium, having not lost to the Bruins at home since 1998. The Bears held the Bruins to 16 yards rushing, while Jahvid Best ran for 115 and Shane Vereen had 99. Riley passed for 153 yards and two touchdowns, although he was sacked three times. For the Bruins, Craft passed for 206 yards and was picked off four times, two coming off tipped balls.
Oregon.
The Bears hosted the Ducks on a rainy day at Memorial Stadium with Riley as the starter. Oregon capitalized on an interception at midfield on Cal's first possession with a 17-yard run by quarterback Jeremiah Masoli with the PAT missing. The Bears responded quickly with a 22-yard pass from Riley to Jeremy Ross on the ensuing possession. Jahvid Best was able to break free for a 50-yard run from the Cal 20-yard line, but fumbled the ball in Ducks territory. The Bears held the Ducks and got a safety when Oregon snapped the ball high and into the end zone on a punt attempt. Cal took advantage of the free kick to advance down the field, during which Riley sustained a concussion when he failed to slide while attempting to gain a first down and was sandwiched between three defenders. He did not return to the game and Nate Longshore stepped into the game.
Best had his second fumble of the game in the second quarter, but Sean Cattouse then intercepted Masoli to negate it. The Bears fumbled again on a rushing attempt by Shane Vereen but the Ducks were stopped cold on a fourth down conversion attempt in Cal territory. The only score of the quarter was set up by a 50-yard interception return by Worrell Williams, capped off by a 2-yard pass from Longshore to Nyan Boateng.
Both teams traded field goals in third quarter until the Ducks blitzed down the field from their own 45-yard line and scored with three plays in 33 seconds on a 17-yard run by running back Jeremiah Johnson for their final score of the game. In the fourth quarter, Ducks cornerback Jairus Bryd fumbled a punt which was recovered by the Bears, allowing Vereen to score on a 2-yard run to put the game away.
Ducks running back Jeremiah Johnson went over the century mark with a 117 yards rushing, including a touchdown, the second rusher to do so against the Bears. Quarterback Jeremiah Masoli himself had 97 rushing yards, more than double his 44 passing yards, including a touchdown run. Longshore finished with a 136 passing yards including one touchdown, while Best had 93 rushing yards. Verran Tucker was the Bears' leading receiver with 83 yards. The Bears' five turnovers were the most since a November 12, 2005 matchup against USC, while Longshore moved up to fourth place in career passing touchdowns with 49 total. The upset victory allowed the Bears to break into the BCS rankings at #21. The Bears also got into the AP Top 25 at #21, their highest ranking thus far for the season and the third time they had done so after two road losses at Maryland and Arizona, both unranked at the time.
USC.
The Bears headed south to face USC at home, putting their highest ranking of the year to date on the line against the #7 Trojans. Longshore got the start for the Bears and played for the first half, throwing two interceptions that were negated by penalties against the USC defense. The Bears held the Trojans to a field goal in the first quarter before marching down the field to respond with one of their own in the second, their only score of the game. Trojans quarterback Mark Sanchez, on the ensuing possession, then led USC on a 70-yard drive capped off by a 19-yard touchdown pass to Patrick Turner. Although the pass appeared on replays to have touched the ground, it was not overturned. The Trojans led the Bears 10–3 at the end of the half.
Kevin Riley stepped in at quarterback in an attempt to bring the Bears back in the second half. He hit Shane Vereen in the end zone on the Bears' first possession of the third quarter on a 27-yard strike, but the play was negated because of an illegal receiver downfield penalty; he was then intercepted on a tipped pass. Both defenses were then able to keep each side from scoring into the fourth quarter. The Trojans were then able to sustain a drive downfield that ended with a 6-yard pass from Sanchez to Ronald Johnson to put the game away.
The Trojan defense held the Bears to 165 net yards, while its offense produced more than double with 411. Sanchez threw for 238 yards, including two touchdowns, while Longshore went for 79 and Riley threw for 59. The Trojans also outrushed the Bears, putting up 173 and holding the latter to only 27. Jahvid Best was held to only 30 rushing yards on 13 carries. The Trojans won their sixth straight game of the year and their fifth straight game against the Bears.
Oregon State.
The Bears traveled north to Corvallis, Oregon for their final road game of the season against the #23 Beavers, who had not yet lost a home game. Jahvid Best took the ensuing kickoff 51 yards to help set up a 5-yard pass from starter Kevin Riley. The Beavers immediately responded when James Rodgers returned the ensuing kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown, the first kickoff return for a score in the Pac-10. Oregon State extended its lead by taking advantage of a 56-yard punt return by Sammie Stroughter to set up a 2-yard run by freshman running back Jacquizz Rodgers and would not relinquish it. Cal scored in the second quarter on a trick play when Riley threw a lateral to Jeremy Ross, who then threw a 30-yard forward pass to Nyan Boateng to make it 17–14 Oregon State at the half.
The Beavers extended their lead in the third quarter with a field goal and 18-yard touchdown run by James Rodgers. Best was able to break free for a 65-yard touchdown run to keep the Bears within a score at 27–21. The Bears had a chance in the final minute of the fourth quarter to make a comeback, but were pinned at their own 6-yard line on a punt and were set back at the 3-yard line by a penalty. Riley was then intercepted by Keenan Lewis for a 25-yard touchdown to seal the victory for the Beavers.
Beavers quarterback Lyle Moevao threw for 145 yards, including one interception and a sack, while Jacquizz Rodgers rushed for 144 yards with one touchdown. Riley threw for 117 yards, was sacked five times, and was picked off once. Best ran for 116 yards, with one touchdown. The Bears would finish the season 1–4 on the road, their sole win coming against Washington State.
Stanford.
Cal hosted Stanford for the 111th Big Game. The Cardinal had won the Axe back the previous year, snapping a five-game losing streak, and came in looking to get their sixth win to become bowl-eligible for the first time since 2001.
The Bears were able to score a field goal on their first possession, set up by a 60-yard run by Jahvid Best. A Cardinal attempt to tie the game with a field goal missed. Cal started a drive late in the first quarter that was halted early in the second when Bo McNally intercepted Kevin Riley on the Stanford 24-yard line. The Cardinal in turn were able to march downfield and were stopped when Cal forced running back Toby Gerhart to fumble and recovered at the Cal 11-yard line. Riley then threw his first touchdown pass of the day, a 59-yard strike to Shane Vereen. Stanford was unable to get into the end zone in the closing seconds of the third quarter with Cal halting Gerhart at the one-yard line and had to settle for a field goal to make the score 10–3 at the half.
The Bears exploded in the third quarter with three touchdowns in just over four minutes. First, The Bears intercepted Tavita Pritchard on the Stanford 40-yard line, setting up a touchdown pass from Riley to Cameron Morrah. They scored again on their next possession on a pass from Riley to Sean Young who then lateraled to Best for a 14-yard score. Best then ran in from a score on Cal's next possession, which was set up by a 42-yard run. The Bears shut down the Cardinal offense, sacking Pritchard three times in addition to intercepting him once. In the fourth quarter, Cal's final score came on a 45-yard run by Best. The Cardinal put up their first points since the first quarter on a 34-yard pass from Pritchard to Doug Baldwin. They successfully recovered an onside kick to score again on a 10-yard run by Gerhart. Pritchard was intercepted on Stanford's next possession on the Cal 27-yard line and then again in the final minutes of the quarter to seal the victory for Cal, with the crowd rushing the field in celebration.
The loss prevented Stanford from becoming bowl-eligible since 2001, Tyrone Willingham's final year as head coach. Pritchard outpassed Riley, throwing for 306 yards and a touchdown, while Gerhart ran for 103. Riley threw for 101 yards, including three scores, while Best ran for a career-high 201 yards and scored three times, becoming the seventh consecutive 1,000-yard rusher under Tedford.
Washington.
The Bears played their final regular season game at home against the winless Huskies in Tyrone Willingham's final game as Washington head coach.
Cal scored on its first possession when Jahvid Best was able to break free for a 60-yard touchdown run. On the following possession the Bears were able to march downfield but missed a 30-yard field goal attempt. However Cal linebacker Zack Follett was able to sack Huskies quarterback Taylor Bean and force a fumble, which the Bears recovered, setting up a field goal from 23 yards.
Following an interception by the Golden Bears, Nate Longshore stepped in for Kevin Riley in the second quarter for his final regular season game at Cal; Best scored with a two-yard touchdown run, followed a 20-yard run. Longshore threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Morrah with nine seconds left in the quarter to make the score at halftime 31–0. The Bear defense caused three Husky turnovers in the quarter.
In the third quarter, Best rushed for his final touchdown of the game on an 84-yard run. Shane Vereen stepped in at running back to relieve Best, who had rushed for a school record of 311 yards, surpassing a 54-year-old record held by Jerry Drew for 283 yards. Vereen was then able to score on a two-yard run. The Huskies got in their sole score of the game on a drive that consumed more than six minutes and culminated in a two-yard run by Bean. Cal then put in its backup players to finish the game, managing to prevent the Huskies from scoring in the fourth quarter.
Best's record-setting 311-yard rushing game was the fourth best performance in the FBS for the 2008 season and the fifth 300-yard rushing game in Pac-10 history. He finished the regular season with 1,394 yards rushing as the Pac-10 rushing leader, surpassing Oregon State's Jacquizz Rodgers who did not play the previous week in the Civil War against Oregon on November 29 due to injury. Longshore' 50th touchdown pass moved him up to fourth overall in touchdown passes for the Golden Bears. The Bears ended the regular season with 23 interceptions, the most since 1953.
The Bears' victory made their record at home perfect at 7–0 and made the Huskies the first 0–12 team in Pac-10 conference history and the only team in the country to finish the 2008 season without a victory. Washington's last win had been against Cal in Seattle in 2007. The Bears had 549 total net yards as opposed to the Huskies' 200, and outrushed them 431 to 104, with net passing yards closer at 118 to 96, respectively.
Emerald Bowl.
The Bears faced the Miami Hurricanes on December 27 in the Emerald Bowl at AT&T Park in San Francisco, California (just across the bay from Berkeley), marking the first appearance by either team in this bowl series. Longshore got the start over Riley for his final collegiate game. On the opposite side, Miami started freshman backup quarterback Jacory Harris after starter Robert Marve was suspended for academic reasons.
The Bears jumped out to an early 14–0 lead on two touchdown runs by Jahvid Best in the first quarter. However the Hurricanes were able to score successive touchdowns on passes from Harris in the second and third quarters, while the Miami defense shut out the Cal offense in the second quarter and limited Cal's scoring in the third to a field goal. With the score tied at 17 apiece, late in the fourth quarter linebacker Zack Follett was able to force a fumble on Harris, which the Bears recovered. Longshore was able to connect with freshman tight end Anthony Miller for his 51st career touchdown pass and the go ahead score. Best earned Offensive MVP honors, while Follett was named the Defensive MVP.
Aftermath.
Cameron Morrah decided to forego his senior season and declared for the NFL draft. He was invited to the NFL Combine alongside Rulon Davis, Anthony Felder, Zack Follett, Alex Mack, and Worrell Williams.
Following the departure of offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti for Pittsburgh, he was replaced by Andy Ludwig, who helped guide the Utah Utes to a perfect 13–0 season as offensive coordinator. Ludwig had previously worked alongside Cal head coach Jeff Tedford at Oregon and Fresno State, becoming the fifth offensive coordinator at Cal in five years.

Rhopalidae

Rhopalidae, or scentless plant bugs are a family of true bugs. In older literature, the family is sometimes called "Corizidae". They differ from the related coreids in lacking well-developed scent glands. They are usually light-colored and smaller than the coreids. Some are very similar to the orsilline lygaeids, but can be distinguished by the numerous veins in the membrane of the hemelytra. They live principally on weeds, but a few (including the box elder bug) are arboreal. All are plant feeders. Currently 18 genera and over 200 species of rhopalids are known.
The box elder bug, "Boisea trivittata", is a common and widely distributed North American species in this group. It is blackish with red markings and 11–14 mm long. It often enters houses and other sheltered places in the fall, sometimes in considerable numbers. It feeds on box elder and occasionally other trees.
The oldest fossil rhopalids described are from the Middle Jurassic of Inner Mongolia, discovered from the Haifanggou Formation.

Laurens Theodorus Gronovius

Laurens Theodorus Gronovius (June 1, 1730 – August 8, 1777), also known as Laurentius Theodorus Gronovius or as Laurens Theodore Gronow, was a Dutch naturalist born in Leiden. He was the son of botanist Jan Frederik Gronovius (1686–1762).
Throughout his lifetime Gronovius amassed an extensive collection of zoological and botanical specimens. He is especially remembered for his work in the field of ichthyology, where he played a significant role in the classification of fishes. In 1754 he published the treatise "Museum ichthyologicum", where he described over 200 species of fish. He is also credited with developing a technique for preservation of fish skins. Today, a number of these preserved specimens are kept in the Natural History Museum in London.
In 1762 he published the second edition of his father's "Flora Virginica exhibens Plantas".

1989 North Indian Ocean cyclone season

The 1989 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was a below-average season in annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean—the Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November. Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45°E and 100°E are included in the season by the IMD.
Throughout the season, the IMD monitored ten depressions, three of which became cyclonic storms. The strongest storm of the year was Super Cyclonic Storm Gay. Crossing the Malay Peninsula into the Bay of Bengal on November 4, Gay became one of the most powerful systems on record in the basin, attaining an estimated pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). Collectively, the storms were responsible for at least 1,785 fatalities, 1,445 of which were due the disastrous flooding triggered by the July Cyclonic Storm, and more than $25 million in damage.
__TOC__
Storms.
Tropical Cyclone 01B.
In mid-May, a monsoon trough situated over the Bay of Bengal began showing signs of cyclonic development. By May 20, synoptic data indicated the presence of a weak circulation; however, the system remained disorganized. Following a dramatic increase in convection and organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on May 23 and subsequently began monitoring the system as a tropical depression hours later. Initially, the depression tracked slowly towards the north-northwest before abruptly turning westward and slowing due to weak mid-level steering currents. During this time, the storm gradually intensified and was limited by northwesterly wind shear. By May 26, the storm turned northward and accelerated. Later that day, 01B attained its peak intensity with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) shortly before making landfall in eastern India. The system quickly weakened once inland and was last noted on May 27 as a dissipating low.
Striking India on May 26, the storm brought wind gusts up to 130 km/h (80 mph) and torrential rains, amounting to , which caused widespread damage. The hardest hit area was Midnapore where more than 10,000 homes were destroyed. At least 17 people were killed in the district alone and more than 50,000 were left homeless. Communications across Orissa were severely disrupted as broadcast stations, government buildings, and hundreds of telephone poles were destroyed. Further inland, heavy rains from the storm triggered several landslides that killed at least two people in Darjeeling Hills. Throughout eastern India, 61 people were killed and more than 500,000 were left homeless by the storm.
In nearby Bangladesh, strong winds produced by the storm destroyed 500 homes across 11 villages. Areas devastated by a tornado a month prior were severely affected by the cyclone. In Tangail, a powerful tornado spawned by the storm destroyed 2,000 homes and killed 10 people. At least 60 people perished and 2,000 others were injured across the country. Offshore, 150 fishermen went missing during the storm and were feared dead. In the wake of the storm, widespread search and rescue missions took place in cities flattened by the cyclone.
Tropical Cyclone 02A.
On June 7, small area of low pressure developed off the west coast of India. Over the following two days, convection associated with the low gradually organized and by June 9, satellite intensity estimates from the JTWC reached 55 km/h (30 mph). A TCFA was subsequently issued for the system before it made landfall in Gujarat early on June 10. Although overland, the low maintained significant convection as it turned westward and through its re-emergence into the Arabian Sea on June 11. Once back over water, convection rapidly spread westward in response to an anticyclone over the Arabian Peninsula and Afghanistan. Early on June 12, the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm status based on a ship report near the center of 65 km/h (40 mph) sustained winds and a surface pressure of 998 mbar (hPa; 29.47 inHg). Later that day, strong wind shear stemming from the anticyclone displaced convection from the tropical storm by more than 110 km (70 mi), prompting the final advisory from the JTWC. The remnants of the system were last noted on June 13 dissipating over the Arabian Sea.
July Cyclonic Storm.
On July 22, the IMD began monitoring a depression over the Bay of Bengal. Tracking west-northwest, the system intensified into a cyclonic storm later that day before making landfall in Andhra Pradesh, just north of Vishakhapatnam. Once onshore the storm accelerated towards the northwest and weakened. By July 24, the remnants of the cyclone were located over the state of Maharashtra. The system was last noted the following day over Gujarat and moving into Pakistan.
Across Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh heavy rains produced by the storm triggered flash flooding and mudslides that killed at least 414 people. According to Chief Minister Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao, approximately 70,000 homes were destroyed in Andhra Pradesh. While over Maharashtra, the storm produced torrential rainfall, reaching in 24 hours in Bombay, which caused deadly flash flooding and mudslides. Most of the railway tracks in metropolitan Bombay were left underwater, paralyzing the city and forcing businesses to close for several days. The city's stock exchange remained open, though only sparse trading was observed. Flood waters isolated 46 villages in the region, prompting the deployment of the Indian Army for rescue missions. At least 500 people were killed throughout Maharashtra, more than 200 of which took place in the Raigad district. An unknown number of people were killed after a bridge collapsed with two train carriages on it. Additionally, 75 others were reported missing in the district according to local police. Offshore, 500 fishermen went missing in connection to the storm and are believed to have died.
Flooding rains extended into Pakistan by July 26. Flash floods in the slums outside Karachi killed at least 16 people and washed away 500 huts. An estimated 20,000 people were left homeless in the city. Communication and transportation throughout Karachi was reportedly paralyzed as well due to widespread power outages. Further north in Hyderabad, six others were killed by the storm. Throughout the country, at least 31 people were killed.
Super Cyclonic Storm Gay.
On November 2, a tropical depression, later named "Gay", developed in the Gulf of Thailand and favorable atmospheric conditions allowed the system to undergo rapid intensification. By November 3, Gay had intensified to a Category 3-equivalent typhoon before striking Thailand. Crossing the Kra Isthmus in approximately six hours, the system emerged into the Bay of Bengal as a Category 1-equivalent cyclone and assumed a west-northwesterly track towards India. For the next four days, the storm gradually reorganized before reaching a small area favorable for more significant intensification late on November 6. Hours before making landfall in India, Gay attained its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone with winds estimated at 260 km/h (160 mph). Additionally, the IMD estimated that the storm had three-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (145 mph), classifying Gay as a modern-day Super Cyclonic Storm. The powerful storm soon made landfall near Kavali, India, in Andhra Pradesh before rapidly weakening onshore. The system eventually dissipated over Maharashtra on November 10.
In Thailand, the storm caused extensive damage both onshore and off, killing 833 people and inflicting approximately () in damage. Striking India as a powerful cyclone, Gay damaged or destroyed about 20,000 homes in Andhra Pradesh, leaving 100,000 people homeless. In that country, 69 deaths and () in damage were attributed to Gay.
Other storms.

Electoral district of Glendalough

The Electoral district of Glendalough was a Legislative Assembly electorate in the state of Western Australia. The district was named for the inner northern Perth suburb of Glendalough, which fell within its borders. The seat was abolished after two terms at the 1994 redistribution, taking effect from the 1996 election due to the one vote one value legislation. Most parts of the former seat presently fall within the seats of Churchlands and Perth.
Glendalough was created out of parts of Balcatta and the abolished Subiaco at the 1988 redistribution, which gave effect to electoral legislation passed the previous year which increased metropolitan representation in the 57-seat Legislative Assembly from 29 to 34. The seat was first contested in the 1989 election at which Labor candidate and former member for Subiaco, Dr Carmen Lawrence, was successful.
A year after the Labor government's defeat at the 1993 election, Lawrence was offered an opportunity to enter federal politics with the retirement of John Dawkins, who had resigned as Member for Fremantle. Lawrence resigned from the state parliament and won the Fremantle federal by-election, soon becoming Health Minister in the Keating government. Michelle Roberts, meanwhile, won the Glendalough state by-election caused by Lawrence's departure.
The seat was abolished in the 1994 redistribution, and was split between the new districts of Churchlands and Yokine. Roberts contested and won the eastern suburbs seat of Midland.

This War Is Ours

This War Is Ours is the second album by American rock band Escape the Fate. Departing from the darker sound present in the band's first full length album, "Dying Is Your Latest Fashion", "This War Is Ours" features a hard rock, mainstream sound with less screamed vocals. It is the first Escape the Fate album to feature former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt on vocals. The album received mixed reviews from critics. It was produced by John Feldmann, and released on October 21, 2008 through Epitaph Records.
The album debuted at No. 35 on the "Billboard" 200, selling 13,000 copies in the first week.
Promotion.
Starting on September 2, 2008, fans of Escape the Fate went to a special page on Buzznet to help unlock "the first track" off of "This War Is Ours". Once the page had 50,000 viewers at the same time, the new song was then released to play and download for free. In order for a user's "page view" to be considered a contribution to the counter, the page had to remain open and active. Other sites could be used through different tabs or new windows, as long as the Buzznet page stayed open. Because this was a difficult task, fans were asked to "tell everyone know to come to [the page" in an attempt to reach 50,000 views as fast as possible. About 30 hours after the project started, the new song titled "The Flood" was unlocked and was also available for free download to anyone (whether they participated or not).
On October 1, 2008, the band released "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)" for download.
Copies of the album were made available to buy on their tour with Chiodos and Silverstein, even before the album's official release date.
The official video for "Something" was released to MTV on January 12, 2009.
The video for the album's third single "10 Miles Wide" was released June 9, 2009.
"This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)" is the fourth single off the album. The video was shot in Santa Ana, California on January 9, 2010. The video was released along with the deluxe edition of the album on April 27, 2010.
Deluxe special edition.
In an interview with Max and Craig, they stated that they would re-release "This War Is Ours" with a bonus disc with many different features not seen before.
The CD includes two new songs, "Bad Blood" and "Behind the Mask", an acoustic version of "Harder Than You Know", and a remix called "This War Is Mine" by Clown of Slipknot. It also comes with a DVD that features the music videos to "The Flood", "Something", "10 Miles Wide", and "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)". It also comes with a world tour documentary and a behind the music feature. The deluxe edition was released on April 27, 2010.
There is a typo in the insert booklet for "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)", the lyrics for "10 Miles Wide" are listed. However, "10 Miles Wide" has the correct lyrics printed.
For the "10 Miles Wide" video on the DVD, any time a curse word is said that word is censored. However, the official video for "10 Miles Wide" on Epitaph Records' YouTube channel is not censored. Behind the Music and the European Tour (featured on the DVD) also do not censor curse words.

Catfights and Spotlights

Catfights and Spotlights is the sixth studio album by British pop band Sugababes, released by Island Records in the Netherlands and Ireland on 17 October 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2008. It was primarily produced by Klas Åhlund, Steve Booker and Orson, with additional contribution from Si Hulbert, The Invisible Men, Melvin Kuiters, and Max Martin. It is the group's final album to include remaining founding member Keisha Buchanan.
The album received a generally positive reception from the media and music critics, but became the group's third lowest-charting and second lowest-selling album, reaching number eight and the top twenty in the UK and on the Irish Albums Chart, respectively. "Catfights and Spotlights" spawned only two singles, with the international top ten entry "Girls". The second and final single "No Can Do" was released on 22 December 2008.
Recording and theme.
After they had completed the "Change Tour" in May 2008, the Sugababes announced that they would not go back into the recording studio until September 2008 to work on their next album, insisting they needed more time to work on their new material. However, on 15 June 2008, band member Keisha Buchanan told an interviewer that the group would start work on a new album straight away due to opportunities to record with new producers, and by 17 June the trio had started recording. Less than a month later at the annual "Liverpool Summer Pops" in Liverpool, they announced that the lead single was completed, describing it as "amazing." The title of the single, "Girls", was revealed on 11 August 2008 and was released on 6 October 2008 in the UK.
The album has been described as having a "funkier" sound by Orson's lead singer Jason Pebworth, who has been working with the group in the recording studio. In an interview, the Sugababes described the "Catfights and Spotlights" as having a more mellow and mature sound which focuses mainly on their vocals.
The album was also described by Range as darker.
Sales and impact.
"Catfights and Spotlights" debuted at number eight on the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of over 23,000 copies, becoming their fifth studio-album to reach the top ten in the United Kingdom. However, it also became their first album since their debut "One Touch" not to peak inside the national top three. The album fell out of the top fifty in its fourth week of release. As of Monday, 19 January, the album jumped 22 places from 96 to 74 with sales 2,000. It was eventually certified Silver by the BPI.
In Ireland, the album debuted at number 18, before falling to number 42 the following week, while in Greece, the album entered at number 33, before dropping to number 37 the following week. However, on its third week the album climbed to number 22.
On an interview to "Daily Star Sunday", Sugababes member Heidi Range blamed their music label, Island, for disappointing sales of their new album. According to Range, "The sales have been disappointing but I don't think it is a reflection on the album's quality, and the problem is the promotion, I don't actually think our fans know we've even got an album out."
An unreleased song that never made the cut to the album, "Hot Under the Collar" leaked online in February 2013 - almost 5 years after the album's release.

1 "Every Heart Broken" is titled as "Murder One" for Greek editions of the album.

<doc id="18833981" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18833981" title="Friar Tuck">
Friar Tuck

Friar Tuck is a companion to Robin Hood in the legends about that character.
History.
He is a common character in modern Robin Hood stories, which depict him as a jovial friar and one of Robin's Merry Men. The figure of Tuck was common in the May Games festivals of England and Scotland during the 15th through 17th centuries. He appears as a character in the fragment of a Robin Hood play from 1475, sometimes called "Robin Hood and the Knight" or "Robin Hood and the Sheriff", and a play for the May games published in 1560 which tells a story similar to Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar. (The oldest surviving copy of this ballad is from the 17th century.) It has often been argued that the character entered the tradition through these folk plays, and that he may have originally been partnered with Maid Marian. His appearance in "Robin Hood and the Sheriff" means that he was already part of the legend around the time when the earliest surviving copies of the Robin Hood ballads were being made.
A friar with Robin's band in the historical period of Richard the Lion-Hearted would have been impossible, because the period predates friars in England; however, the association of the Robin Hood with Richard I was not made until the 16th century; the early ballad A Gest of Robin Hood names his king as "Edward".
What follows is a story which includes different versions of the legend. He was a former monk of Fountains Abbey (or in some cases, St Mary's Abbey in York, which is also the scene of some other Robin Hood tales) who was expelled by his order because of his lack of respect for authority. Because of this, and in spite of his taste for good food and wine, he becomes the chaplain of Robin's band. In Howard Pyle's "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood", he is specifically sought out as part of the tale of Alan-a-Dale: Robin has need of a priest who will marry Allan to his sweetheart in defiance of the Bishop of Hereford.
In many tales, from "Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar" to Howard Pyle's "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood", his first encounter with Robin results in a battle of wits in which first one and then the other gains the upper hand and forces the other to carry him across a river. This ends in the Friar tossing Robin into the river.
In some tales, he is depicted as a physically fit man and a skilled swordsman and archer with a hot-headed temper. However, most commonly, Tuck is depicted as a fat, bald and jovial monk with a great love of ale, though the two are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes, the latter depiction of Tuck is the comic relief of the tale.
Two royal writs in 1417 refer to Robert Stafford, a Sussex chaplain who had assumed the alias of Frere Tuk. This "Friar Tuck" was still at large in 1429. These are the earliest surviving references to a character by that name.
Portrayals in other media.
In the movie "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938) the character Friar Tuck was played by actor Eugene Pallette as a fat individual fond of food but also skilled with a sword. He was also quick to quarrel with any one who slighted him or deprived him of his food.
In the late 1950s British television series "The Adventures of Robin Hood" he was played by Alexander Gauge as a fat friar a tad too devoted to good eating. He is also clearly devoted to the Church and the poor people he serves, using his wits in order to spare them unjust taxes, provide them education or shelter them from harm. He often uses the power and rights of the Church to good effect against the forces of the Sheriff.
The 1958 Merrie Melodies animated short "Robin Hood Daffy" featured Porky Pig as a "fat friar", who sought Robin Hood, but refused to believe Daffy Duck was the legendary outlaw. At the end of the cartoon, Daffy becomes "Friar Duck".
In the 1966 television series "Rocket Robin Hood", Friar Tuck is again depicted as a traditional fat friar with a tonsure, despite the story taking place in the year 3000. Friar Tuck is memorable for a vignette that played during each episode depicting him in front of a large feast, taking a single bite of each piece of food on the table before throwing it over his shoulder.
In the 1973 Disney animated "Robin Hood", Friar Tuck is a badger, voiced by Andy Devine. He is taken to be hanged at the end of the film in a plot of Prince John's to lure Robin Hood out of hiding. He is rescued in time.
In the British "Robin of Sherwood" TV series of the 1980s Friar Tuck was played by Phil Rose. In this version the character reluctantly served the Sheriff of Nottingham's brother, an evil abbot, and also served as Maid Marian's confessor. He helped Marian escape, and joined the band alongside her.
In "", Tuck was played by Mike McShane, drawing heavily on the overweight, ale-loving interpretation.
The Mel Brooks movie "" parodies the character as "Rabbi Tuckman," a self-described "purveyor of sacramental wine and mohel extraordinaire." Brooks, who also plays the character, made Tuckman Jewish (as Brooks himself is Jewish), reprising a gag from "Blazing Saddles" where Brooks made a cameo as a Jewish Native American.
In the video game "", Tuck was once again portrayed as Marian's confessor. He joins the band at her request. His enjoyment of alcohol is in the game as one of his abilities involves leaving beer flasks to intoxicate the guards.
In the 1991 film adaptation "Robin Hood", Friar Tuck (played by Jeff Nuttall) is portrayed as an itinerant seller of phony relics, who is first mugged and then adopted by the Merry Men. He also confesses to being on the run for killing the nephew of an abbot.
Friar Tuck is called Brother and later Father Tuck in Angus Donald's "Outlaw Chronicles" series - so named as "there were no friars in England at that time"; consisting of "Outlaw" (2009), "Holy Warrior" (2010) and "King's Man" (2011).
The first appearance of Tuck (in this case, not an anachronistic Friar) in the BBC show Robin Hood came in 2009 during its third series. After Robin was hurled over a ravine by Guy of Gisbourne, Tuck finds Robin further downstream. Tuck distracts Guy from the cave he is treating Robin in, after Guy is told to look for Robin's body, thus saving Robin's life. He is played by David Harewood, and portrayed as African.
Mark Addy plays Friar Tuck in Ridley Scott's "Robin Hood" (2010). In the film, his hobby is beekeeping, which he uses to make mead and as a weapon against the French.
Data impersonates Friar Tuck in episode named Qpid (1991) from Gene Roddenberry's series (4th season, episode 20).
Cultural references.
A pattern in androgenic alopecia (male balding) has been named after the character. Like the widow's peak, Friar Tuck has been attached to naming the final stages of balding in men. The Friars Tuck is the common pattern of a border of hair around the back of the head/neck and the sides of the head. This is attached to Friar Tuck the character due to the similar appearance of his tonsure.

Top Gear Australia

Top Gear Australia is an Australian motoring television series based on the BBC series "Top Gear".
The show premiered on SBS One on 29 September 2008 at 7:30 pm AEST, with its first season consisting of 8 episodes. A second season was announced following the release of ratings figures for the premiere and favourable comments from advertisers, and began airing from 11 May 2009. After acquiring the rights to broadcast the UK version in 2009, the Nine Network started airing their own version of "Top Gear Australia" in September 2010. "Top Gear Australia" returned for a fourth season in 2011. The show has since been cancelled as of 14 September 2011 due to declining ratings.
"Top Gear Australia " is also the name of a licensed version of the British "Top Gear" magazine. The Australian magazine is produced by ACP Magazines (Australian Consolidated Press). The magazine features articles from many writers including Steven Corby, Craig Jamieson, Bill Mckinnon, James Stanford, Ben Smithurst, Jason Barlow, Sam Phillip, Ollie Marriage, Dan Read and Paul Horrell.
Presenters.
Prior to filming SBS made an open casting call for presenters, resulting in over 4000 applications. The original hosts chosen for "Top Gear Australia" were cartoonist and motoring columnist Warren Brown, MotoGP commentator Charlie Cox, and race driver / driving instructor Steve Pizzati.
Marketing prior to the first episode stated that the presenters would be joined by The Stig's "Australian cousin", but in the first episode the driver was introduced as just "The Stig". Steve Pizzati suggested that The Stig have an "Australian" name, such as "Stiggo", but the other presenters refused. The season 2 opener clarified that "Top Gear Australia"'s Stig is not intended to be the same Stig from the UK series.
On 19 December 2008, Charlie Cox announced he was leaving the program as he felt he was unable to offer enough time to the show. SBS subsequently announced that trumpeter James Morrison would be his replacement, joining Warren and Steve for season two. Morrison had previously appeared as a guest in the sixth episode.
For the third season, early reports claimed that former Australian cricketer Shane Warne would take over the hosting of the show alongside original "Top Gear" host Jeremy Clarkson, although the BBC ultimately ruled out Clarkson's involvement in the Australian version. On 20 June 2010, it was announced that actor and comedian Shane Jacobson and "Top Gear Australia" magazine editor Ewen Page would join a returning Steve Pizzati to present the show for the Nine Network, which premièred on 28 September 2010 with a 75-minute The Ashes special, in which the hosts faced off against their Top Gear UK counterparts in a series of motoring-related challenges. The UK presenters won after cheating in the final challenge by using a professional race driver instead of James May.
Production.
Mirroring the UK series, the studio segments were recorded at Bankstown Airport in Sydney. An exact copy of the UK studio at Dunsfold Park was constructed in a hangar (Hangar Building 581). The power laps and "Star in a Bog Standard Car" were recorded at Camden Airport with parts of the runways and taxiways used as a test track.
"Top Gear Australia" uses the same theme music as the UK series, a version of The Allman Brothers Band's "Jessica".
Segments.
"Top Gear Australia" features segments that mirror those seen on the BBC series, including build challenges and test drives. A significant difference is that speeds and power are quoted in metric units and prices are quoted in Australian dollars.
Power Lap.
A test track around Camden Airport is used for power laps. The initial track used in the first two seasons consisted of nine corners running in an anti-clockwise direction. The first corner was The Question Mark followed by Clarkson Corner then The Crest and Turn 4 which was followed by the Main Straight before coming to a series of Chicanes then 06 Corner (named after the direction of the runway) then the Short Left Hander and the Bus Stop Entry and Exit followed by the finish line.
At the start of Season 3, Top Gear Australia revealed a new test track. Still situated at Camden Airport, the new course built upon the old one by adding a new section, thus looping into a figure of eight. It contains twelve corners, a total length of 2.3 km and moves the Start/Finish line from between the Bus Stop and The Question Mark to the end of the Back Straight, ahead of the Bus Stop. The direction of the course is now clockwise, turning the main runway into the first straight. The first corner leads into a Hammerhead-like corner called The Blowout, followed by another straight which crest a small hill into a couple of Left Handers, turns 3 and 4. Exiting turn 4 leads back to the main runway and turn 5, Brocky's Corner. The track then crosses over The Blowout into a right then left hander called The Flipper. The next turn is the Question Mark hairpin from the old track. Finally, after a short straight, the course reaches the signature Bus Stop which is then followed by two right hand corners (including the old 06 Corner) back into the Start/Finish.
Lap times.
New Track Lap Times
Star in a Bog Standard Car.
The Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment is mirrored with the name "Star in a Bog Standard Car". It is identical in execution. The car used in the first two seasons on SBS was a Proton Satria Neo, the third season on Nine used a 2nd hand Ford XG Falcon ute, manufactured in 1995.
What Were They Thinking?
In the first season, the presenters discuss "stupid" ideas in motoring history and put pictures of them on a board. The board was later destroyed in the first episode of the second season when the shark cage Mini Moke was dropped on top of it.
Old car commercials.
Every episode in the second season of Top Gear Australia, an old car commercial was shown.
Stunts.
Imitating its BBC counterpart, the show includes features where the hosts undertake various stunts some of which may antagonise members of the public. In October 2008 it was reported that Pizzati and Brown caused a traffic jam in Toorak, Victoria when they drove a tractor through the Melbourne suburb — a reference to the colloquial expression "Toorak Tractor", Australian slang for luxury SUVs. The stunt featured in episode 5 of series 1, which aired on 27 October 2008.
V8 to the Rescue.
In series three, a new segment called V8 to the Rescue, was introduced. It saw the presenters attempt to solve the world's problems by fitting a V8 engine to an everyday item, including a see-saw and cricket bowler. The segment appeared in every episode of the fourth series at the end of the episode.
Reception.
The first episode debuted with an audience of 933,000 viewers, SBS's highest ever ratings for a locally produced television programme. "Top Gear Australia" came third in its time slot and beat an elimination episode of "Australian Idol". The figure was slightly higher than any season premiere of the BBC version aired on SBS, up until that date. However, subsequent episodes failed to match this figure, and the first season averaged around 650,000 viewers an episode. In comparison, viewing figures for the previous three "Top Gear UK" episodes shown in the same timeslot averaged around 903,000 viewers, though during this period "Top Gear Australia" still remained the highest rating program on SBS. Series one has since been repeated on SBS Two.
For the second series SBS attempted to address some of the criticism brought up against the first series. The second series of the show debuted with 689,000 viewers, averaging 576,500 viewers across the series against the high rating "MasterChef Australia". Ratings dropped throughout the second series, leading to speculation that SBS would not buy a third series.
Jeremy Clarkson has commented on the Australian version, saying "We're loving it, even though your funny accents make you hard to understand".
The third series premiered on 28 September 2010 on the Nine Network, pulling in 1,538,000 viewers, making it the second most watched television programme that day. The 75-minute "The Ashes" special, which featured the "Top Gear UK" presenters facing against the Australian presenters in a series of challenges, also won its timeslot against competing programmes.
The Nine Network renewed the series for a 4th season in 2011 before being cancelled after three of the six recorded episodes aired due to declining ratings. The remaining unaired episodes were eventually burnt-off on Nine's subchannel Go! in April 2012.
Magazine.
An Australian version of "Top Gear" magazine titled "Top Gear Australia" (published by Park Publishing, a partnership between ACP Magazines and the BBC) was launched in June 2008 and features an amalgam of original Australian articles together with licensed content from the British and other international versions of the magazine.
DVD Release.
The third series of Top Gear Australia was released on 3 March 2011, and contained the first three episodes from the series, as well as . Series four was released on 1 March 2012, and also contained episode four from the third series.
Unaired Episodes.
Channel 9 had not shown the final episode of the third series, or the final three episodes from the fourth. The remaining episodes from series four began to be shown in April 2012 on GO!. The episode from series three was going to be included in the first DVD release, but was removed at the last minute. Images from this episode appear on the case and discs, and the episode is included in the running time. All of the unaired episodes were included in the second DVD release.
International Broadcast.
Every episode of Top Gear Australia has been broadcast in New Zealand on Prime, excluding the final series. The show is also broadcast on BBC Knowledge.

The core of the base is an old radar bought to Bendix Corporation in 1976. The radar is mounted on the top of a 23 meters high tower and it’s erected over a subterranean bunker that contains the main control room.
In this room the information captured by military radars deployed along the Argentine border is collected and processed in real time by a recently acquired computerized system.
The group depends directly from the Air Operations Command (Spanish: Comando de Operaciones Aéreas) and it’s commanded by a commodore (Spanish: "comodoro"), a rank equivalent to Group Captain in the RAF and colonel in the USAF.
On 2009, the government of Spain donates two 3D radars to be mounted in Resistencia, Chaco and Posadas, Misiones. Others seven 3D radars are being built by INVAP

They include the medical thriller "Pandemic" (2007, Hallmark), the pirate adventure "Blackbeard" (2006, Hallmark), and the disaster epic "The Poseidon Adventure" (2005, NBC). 
In television, Zabel was showrunner (creator or developer/producer/writer) on the UFO-conspiracy series "Dark Skies" from 1996–1997, "The Crow: Stairway to Heaven" from 1998–1999 and the Fox African-American superhero series "M.A.N.T.I.S." from 1994-1995. He also wrote and produced on "" (1993–1994), and "The Fifth Corner" (1992).

As an actor, he appeared as a reporter in the "Dark Skies" episode "The Warren Omission", and as a priest in the "Lois & Clark" episode, "All Shook Up".
In 2001, Zabel became the first writer/producer to be elected as Chairman and CEO of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, since his boyhood idol Rod Serling. Elected the month before 9/11, he took office at a time when he was forced to twice postpone the 53rd Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2006, he was interviewed about this decision by the Dallas-based Media Orchard :""In 2001, the Emmys were scheduled for September 16th. So we cancelled them. What else could we do? Five days after 9/11 nobody was going to be in a self-congratulatory mood to celebrate on red carpets with little gold statues when thousands had died so tragically. We re-scheduled for October 7. Incredibly, that's the day the bombing campaign in Afghanistan began. We were forced to cancel again. I went out that morning before some 200 TV cameras with Les Moonves of CBS and we talked to the media about all this. I got a call from a friend who said, "Dude, you've been on TV more this weekend than the president." It was an amazing media carpet ride -- appearances on everything from "Politically Incorrect" to "The Today Show." Anyway, we tried again on November 4 and actually did the show. We were up against the seventh game of an exciting World Series but who cared?""
While leading the TV Academy the next year, he led the negotiations that resulted in the Emmy telecast license fee being increased by 250 percent. He left office in 2003, saying his one term was so eventful it felt like two.

Doraine and Ellis

Doraine and Ellis (Doraine Renard: 1913–2003 and Ellis Lucas: 1916–2006) were an American husband and wife vaudeville and variety singing team of the twentieth century, who often billed themselves as "The Singing Sweethearts" or "America's Foremost Singing Team". 
Touring with the USO for hundreds of performances during World War II at the behest of Bob Hope, whom the couple knew from their days of performing at nightclubs around the United States,
Doraine and Ellis entertained Allied troops on bills with such performers as Morey Amsterdam and Martha Raye before being forced to return stateside following minor injuries received in London during the Blitz.
USO years.
Following a show at the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel, where the duo was playing an extended engagement shortly after the outbreak of World War II, General James Mollison, who was in the audience, asked the couple to perform for his troops. Shuttling from Atlanta to Mobile, Alabama for Sunday shows on their days off, Doraine and Ellis gave several performances for Mollison's troops who were stationed there. Bob Hope then requested that they sign up to go overseas with their show and had a tour of U.S. military installations arranged for them by the Hollywood Victory Committee. Their initial tour was to include only installations in the southwest U.S.; however, while playing an engagement in Indio, California, the couple received instructions to leave for New York the following day for a show at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. From there, they were sent to Miami for a show but were quickly diverted to play for British troops in the Bahamas and Bermuda.
By 1944, Doraine and Ellis's overseas work in World War II had taken them on a 13-month tour of fighting fronts in 23 countries, placing them in the ranks of the most seasoned veterans of U.S.O. camp shows. The couple's U.S.O. shows took them to Iceland, England, and British, French, and Dutch Guiana in addition to many tropical island locations that they were prevented from disclosing to others at the time for security reasons. "A lot of times we were flown to a ship or an island and never did know just where we were," Ellis said in a contemporary newspaper article about their work.
Troops that Doraine and Ellis entertained on their overseas tour appreciated most the couple's offerings of semiclassical and light operatic fare, requesting their versions of "Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life", "Indian Love Call", and Jerome Kern's "Make Believe". According to Doraine, the troops wanted to hear their version's of "sentimental songs that reminded them of their girls back home."
In a 2004 interview Ellis commented that the soldiers always appreciated the effort to distract them from their deadly duties. "They needed to be entertained to relieve the pressures they were under on the battlefield. They were just so enthusiastic." 
The need for military secrecy played out in other ways during the couple's tour. In late 1944, they reported that the show that most stood out in their memory to that date was one that had taken place at a bomber base in England in June 1944, when the colonel in charge had to cancel a post-performance visit to the officers' club, citing pending "important business" the next morning and the need for "a few hours sleep". The next morning they learned that the colonel's "important business" was D-Day.
Doraine and Ellis often joked that "bugs rather than bombs" were their chief disturbance on tour. "At one jungle training camp in a malarial control zone, we were supposed to give an afternoon show, but travel was so bad that we didn't arrive until after sundown. You're not supposed to go around at night without net covering but Doraine stood in the spotlight in a flimsy gown, bare neck and shoulders, singing to soldiers all covered with mosquito netting." Danger from bombings was a reality though: during their stay in England, the couple were knocked out by a robot bomb and narrowly escaped injury from another. Doraine was hit by falling plaster in a War Department building. While playing the London Palladium, an air raid alert sounded. Both expected a rush for shelters but were amazed that the rest of the show went on. Seeing the courage of their fellow performers and of the audience, they continued with their own performance.
Eventually, the couple were forced to return to America after being among those injured from the first successful German V-1 rocket to hit England in June 1944.
Post-War and later career.
In the immediate post-war years of the 1940s Doraine and Ellis held the house record at many venues, including the Empire Room at Chicago's Palmer House, returning annually for many seasons. The couple appeared on early television shows such as "The Morey Amsterdam Show".
In later years, they toured the country extensively in their "Costumed Calvacade of Broadway's Greatest Musical Hits", a revue in which they presented musical selections from "Show Boat", "Annie Get Your Gun", "South Pacific", "Oklahoma!", "My Fair Lady", "The Music Man" and so on and became successful producers in their own right through their production company, Harmony House Attractions. In the 1960s, accompanist Earl Wentz joined the team for several tours throughout the United States.
Critical response.
Doraine and Ellis presented an optimistic, glamorous, yet wholesome portrait of America in their act, garnering wide acclaim: "They more than live up to their title "Romance in Song"; "Sensational singing duo...glamorous costuming, as well as excellent stage presence make them one of the most delightful attractions to appear here; and "You'll fall in love with Doraine and Ellis. They radiate wholesome charm.". The show business publication, "Variety" raved, "Fine voices and personalities combine to produce a smooth session of well chosen, cleverly arranged songs.".
The team made appearances in 48 states and 23 countries before retiring in the 1990s. Their extensive costume collection was donated to the costume department of Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte, NC.

Shaykh Syed Mir Mirak Andrabi

'Shayakh Syed Mir Mohammad Mirak Andrabi' ( 921-990 A.H.) is the fifth generation of Sadaat-Andrabia in the valley of Kashmir. His ancestors Syed Ahmad Andrabi (who was great grand father of Syed Mirak Andrabi)had migrated from Andarab, "( a valley located in the southern part of Baghlan province in the northeastern Afghanistan)" along with 700 syed's with Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani in '781 A.H = 1379 C.E.' (in Reign of Sultan Qutbuddin) for the spread of Islam. After Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani went back, most of them lived in the valley including Syed Ahmad Andrabi. Syed Ahmad Andrabi died in (804 A.H. = 1402 C.E.). The ruler of that time, Sultan Sikander built a "Khankah" & "Madrasa" at Malaratta (Mala Iraqi Hatta) in Srinagar for him which is known as Khankah-i-Andrabia. This became the place of prayer, meditation and preaching for the generations to come.
Early life.
He was born to Allama Syed Shams-ud-din Andrabi "(860 A.H = 1456 C.E. -932 A.H.= 1526 C.E.)" in Srinagar. Mir Mirak Andrabi traced his patrimony through his father, Syed Shams-ud-din, to 'Imam Zain-ul-Abedein ' and finally to 'Imam Ali'. His mother, Syeda Mira Bibi, with twenty three links, reached to 'Imam Ali'. His year of birth is 921 A.H = 1515 C.E. He lost his parents at a quite young age. He studied "Fiqah, Ahadees, Hifiz" and "Tafseer" in his very early boyhood.
Family background.
Syed Muslim, a great Sufi, migrated from Arab and settled down in Andarab, Afghanistan. Andrab is the name of a large stream in Afghanistan and it empties into the stream which originates in the Hindu Kush near Khawak Pass and flows to the west for about seventy five miles before merging into the Surkhab.Together the two streams form a long narrow valley. The upper part of that valley is also called Andrab, the lower part alternately as Khinjan or Doshi Both parts of the valley had been united governmentally under a single leader or hakim who resided at Banu.Abdul Habibi, the author of Tarikhi Afghanistan Baad-Auz Islam writes about its origin and the occupation of people. He says “according to Hieun-Sangs version, it was best known by the name of Anth polo also”. Agriculture was the main occupation of people. 
Andrab has remained the main center of Gold and silver. The people were freedom loving, kind and compassionate. The descendants of Syed Muslim spread over to various parts of sub-continent in order to propagate Islamic teachings. The absolute love of God made them to sacrifice their native land for the purpose of propagation of Islam Andrabis in valley of Kashmir Syed Ahmad Andrabi, (d.A.H.804/A.D, 1401), and his son Syed Mohammad Andrabi, (d.A.H.850/A.D, 1447), came to Kashmir under the duress of Mir Syed Ali Hamdani during the reign of Sultan Qutabu’d-Din,775-792.A.H./1373-89.A.D.It was on the spiritual instructions of Mir Syed Ali Hamdani (R.A) that Syed Ahmad Andrabi and his son stayed in Kashmir and played a major role in the propagation of Islam and that accordingly metamorphosed the destiny of people. Besides they guided and impressed upon the people to follow the path of Shariah. With the missionary zeal and zest they imparted spiritual and religious teachings to the people of Kashmir. Because of their tireless efforts, they did succeed in bringing about a significant and perceptible change in the mindset and life of people in Kashmir. They also influenced the Sultan Qutubu’d-din,775-792.A.H./1373-89.A.D, with their appealing behavior.
Spiritual Training.
Syed Mirak belonged to Silsila Owaisi. The Owaisi Sufi's receive guidance and knowledge through a spiritual connection. Shaykh Mirak Mir spent most of his time in meditation at a Khanqah in Srinagar, known as Khanqah-i-Andrabi. He himself says that he was guided by Khizir and had him in his dreams quite often. He had visions of the prophet Muhammad many times, and in fact was asked to marry and thus follow his "Sunah" by Prophet Muhammad himself. He then came in contact with Syed Shah Nia'matullah Wali Qadri Hisari, a well known saint in Qadri Silsila. Syed Mirak accepted Silsilay Qadri from him.
Shaykh Syed Mir Mirak Andrabi spent most of his time in meditation at a Khanqah-i-Andrabi in Srinagar, besides spending 12 years meditating at Astarwun(Tral) and then remained in seclusion at Mohalla Naidyar for 12 years. After spending 24 years in meditation, he came back and lived in a small room adjacent to Khankah-i-Andrabia, Malaratta, but preferred a simple life, far away from fame. He was often advised by his relatives,who held important posts under the sultans, to take up a government job after the death of his father, but Mir Mirak Andrabi declined and spent his time in meditation.

Among all the descendants, the noteworthy and prominent was Syed Mir Mirak, d.990.A.H./1582.A.D), Andrabi son of Syed Shamsu’d-din Andrabi,(d.932.A.H./1525.A.D).He was putting up in the Khanqahi Andrabia at Malaratta (Mala Iraqi Hatta) Srinagar.He was the follower of Qadriya Sufi order and was among the prominent disciple of Syed Nimatullah Shah Qadri (d.990.A.H/1582.A.D), who laid the foundation of Qadriya Sufi order in the valley of Kashmir in the second half of 16 the century during the rule of Chaks, 968-994.A.H/1561-86.A.D. Syed Mir Mirak Andrabi traveled various parts of the valley for the purpose of propagation of Islam. The society has accepted him as their guide to religious path and adviser in all their day today matters. He acted as the true mentor of Kashmiri society, and used to move from place to place with his followers. Mir Mirak lived at a crucial period in Kashmir history because there were social tensions in the society. He himself was strong supporter of Sunni sect. 
From the Malfuzat it appears that the overall mission of Sheikh was to build up the contemporary Muslim society in Kashmir in accordance with principles of Islamic Shariah.Syed Mir Mirak Andrabi felt that for the acquisition of different types of religious knowledge the teacher should be selected with care. As a good teacher he continued to teach the disciples according to their capacity and prescribed the right path for the spiritual attainments. He compared his task with worldly physicians and said that the medicines might be innumerable, but only a particular medicine is prescribed for a particular disease in accordance with the nature of disease, which is known only to the physicians. The same is the case with the Sufi path, although the forms of devotion are innumerable and all of them are true, the particular disease of the heart of a devotee can be cured only through a particular devotion. He emphasized that the remedies of the sickness of heart are known only to the Prophets, Auliyas, pious persons and the physicians of the faith. Like all spiritual teachers Mir Mirak Andrabi, laid great stress on Namaz. He pleads that it should precede all other acts of devotion. But the key to prayer is purification, which is of three kinds, firstly the clothes and body, secondly of the Nafs, (lower soul), and thirdly of the heart. He who does not purify his body and clothes is, Najs (unclean) according to the, Ahli-Shariah. The other two kinds of purification can be achieved only by the followers on the spiritual path. He held purification as a pre-requisite to prayer, and guided the people and taught them the principles to be followed while praying. The real meaning of prayer, he said can be understood only by arbab-i-qulub, while going to pray one should banish all desires from their minds and purify their hearts with thoughts of God, if they do it then they face the real, Qibla (Mecca). Mir Mirak said that prayer connects the creature with the creator, and it is a medium through which man can approach God. The real meaning of prayer he says is Munajat, Invocation, which is impossible without concentration. He also asserts that fasting is compulsory for every Muslim, whether rich or poor, however the poor are relieved from the obligation of Zakat and Hajj two of the five principles of Islam. All his descendants became the followers of Qadriya Sufi order. They were instrumental in the construction of Mosques, Khanqahs, Bridges, and Sarais for travelers etc. at different places of the valley.
Death and his children.
Shaykh Syed Mirak Andrabi was married to the daughter of Syed Abdullah Qummi Rizvi. His children included 6 daughters and 3 sons. He was survived by his three sons "Syed Mohammad Andrabi' 963-1023 A.H., 'Syed Ismaiel (Yousuf) Andrabi" and 'Syed Ahmad Qasim Andrabi'. He died on '5th Safar 990 A.H', 28 February 1582 C.E.,at the age of 69 years and is buried on the southern side of Khankah-i-Andrabia at Mala Iraqi Hatta (Mallaratta),Srinagar. A large number of people became his disciples and derived spiritual benefit from him. Syed Mir Mirak Andrabi had three sons, Syed Mohammad Andrabi, (d.1022.A.H/A.D,1614.A.D), Syed Mohammad Yousuf Andrabi, (d.1028.A.H./A.D,1620A.D), and Syed Qasim Ahmad Andrabi. Syed Mohammad Andrabi played an important role in spreading the Quranic to far off areas of valley and was very popular especially in Gurez and Sopore areas of valley . He is buried in the ancestral graveyard at Malaratta. Syed Mohammad Yousuf Andrabi was second son of Syed Mir Mirak Andrabi. He spent most of his time in Dalgate and was also buried there. The third son Syed Qasim Ahmad Andrabi,(d.1040A.H./1631.A.D) migrated to the adjacent area namely Puchal (Pulwama), and settled down there.
Contemporaries.
That era was full of great Scholars and Sufi's. Some of the great Sufi's who were Syed's acquaintances and remained in close touch with him included 'Shaykh Hamza Makhdoom' and 'Baba Dawood Khaki'.
Andrabis in valley of Kashmir.
Syed Ahmad Andrabi, (d.A.H.804/A.D, 1401), and his son Syed Mohammad Andrabi, (d.A.H.850/A.D, 1447), came to Kashmir under the duress of Mir Syed Ali Hamdani during the reign of Sultan Qutabu’d-Din,775-792.A.H./1373-89.A.D.It was on the spiritual instructions of Mir Syed Ali Hamdani (R.A) that Syed Ahmad Andrabi and his son stayed in Kashmir and played a major role in the propagation of Islam and that accordingly metamorphosed the destiny of people. Besides they guided and impressed upon the people to follow the path of Shariah. 
With the missionary zeal and zest they imparted spiritual and religious teachings to the people of Kashmir. Because of their tireless efforts, they did succeed in bringing about a significant and perceptible change in the mindset and life of people in Kashmir. They also influenced the Sultan Qutubu’d-din,775-792.A.H./1373-89.A.D, with their appealing behavior.
Acknowledging their role and contribution Sultan built a Khanqah for them at Mala Iraqi Hatta (Malaratta) Srinagar, popularly known by the name of Khanqahi Andrabia, and also granted the Jagir of Chudran, Weerhar and Auchan in district Pulwama for the maintenance of Khanqah and the followers. The said Khanqah became the centre of Andrabi Syeds, which still occupies its position. Their descendants settled down not only in valley but also at various parts of the world. It was their inner desire to make people understand absolute realities of God. They were not after worldly desires, and it was their selfless love for humanity which equally benefited people here and outside. 
They succeeded in sowing seeds of fraternity among human beings and under their asylum could understand essence of humanity. 
These Sufis were simple and kind-hearted and were as impartial as sun, as generous as river and as tolerant as earth. These Sufis had clearly understood philosophy of existentialism and were making people aware at large of this philosophy through their sober and empathetic attitude. The main centers of Andrabi Syeds in and outside valley of Kashmir are Malaratta, 
Ganderbal, Baramulla,Kupwara,Pulwama, Chadoora, Kulgam, Anantnag.
The Annual commemoration is held at khanqahi Andrabiya Mala Iraqi Hatta (Malaratta) on every 5th of Islamic month of Safar-ul-Muzaffar.

Doria Shafik

Doria Shafiq (, ; 14 December 1908 – 20 September 1975) was one of the women who led the women's liberation movement in Egypt in the early 1950s. As a result of her activities, Egyptian women now have the right to elect and nominate in the Egyptian constitution. She founded literature patrols, and served as a freedom fighter against the British occupation in Egypt.
She was born in Tanta, in the Nile delta and studied in the French mission school. She was among the first female students sent by the Egyptian Ministry of Education to study at Sorbonne University in Paris at the government's expense. She also studied for a PhD in philosophy at the Sorbonne; her thesis subject was "woman in Islam" in which she argued that Islam allows equality for women.
On her return from France accompanied by her husband, the dean of the faculty of arts in Cairo University rejected hiring her in the university because "he cannot have a beautiful woman on his staff". Princess Shuvekar (the first wife of King Fuad I of Egypt), offered her the position of chief manager of the new women's magazine. It was the first magazine, written in Arabic and directed to teach and educate the Egyptian woman. It was founded in the late 1940s, in order to write about topics regarding liberation of Egyptian women.
She founded a movement to eradicate ignorance and illiteracy among girls and women in many populated regions in Cairo and founded a school in Boulaq for the same purpose.
Storming Parliament.
In February 1951, she led a demonstration, accompanied by 1500 Egyptian women, during which she broke into the Egyptian Chamber and spoke to the council to consider the issues and demands of Egyptian women. After a week, the Council granted Egyptian women the right to vote and stand for parliament.
Struggle against occupation.
In 1951, she prepared a paramilitary Task of Egyptian women to resist the British army units in the Suez Canal, indicating a willingness to fight and send trained nurses to the field. She also led a demonstration for women, in which she surrounded the British Barclays Bank in Cairo in January 1951 and called for a Boycott.
Bent Nile Party.
After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, she asked the government to transform "the daughter of the Nile union" into the first women's party of Egypt.
Strike and isolation.
Because of the changing political situation in the country after the revolution, and the absence of genuine political activity, in 1957 Doria Shafiq was put under house arrest after a hunger strike against General Abdel Nasser. She remained in seclusion about 18 years.
Versions translation and literary work.
She issued several periodicals, including "The New Woman" magazine and "daughter of the Nile" and the small chick magazine for children. During her years of house arrest, Shafiq translated the Koran into English and French, and wrote several poetry books in addition to her own memoirs.
After her house arrest in 1957, Nasser had Shafiq's name barred from all Egyptian texts, periodicals, and books. Today, there is very little written about her and it is difficult to find her original texts.
Seclusion and death.
Shafiq was placed under house arrest in 1957 by Nasser. In 1975 she committed suicide by throwing herself off the balcony of her sixth-floor apartment.

Cleveland (30 Rock)

"Cleveland" is the twentieth episode of the first season of "30 Rock". It was written by one of the season's co-executive producers, Jack Burditt, and one of the season's executive producers, Robert Carlock. It was directed by Paul Feig. It first aired on April 19, 2007 on the NBC network in the United States. Guest stars in this episode included Jennifer Bassey, Kevin Brown, Grizz Chapman, Eric DySart, Ramsey Faragallah, Lori Hammel, Lester Holt, Traci Hovel, Gregory Korostishevsky, Jenelle Marlbrough, Anthony Mazza, Raymond McAnally, Jack Moran, Emily Mortimer, Maulik Pancholy, Brian Patrick Russell, Mitch Poulos, Justin Smith, Jason Sudeikis, Gary Tacon, Mira Tzur and Julian Walker.
In this episode, Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) and Floyd (Jason Sudeikis) visit Cleveland, Ohio when Floyd says he wishes that he could live there. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) goes on the run from The Black Crusaders. Liz discovers that Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) fiancée, Phoebe (Emily Mortimer), is keeping some deceiving secrets.
Plot.
When Floyd (Jason Sudeikis) loses out on a possible job promotion to Alan Garkel (Eric Dysart)—an African-American candidate in a wheelchair—he informs Liz Lemon of his aspirations to move back home to Cleveland. After Floyd asks Liz about her own future in New York, she begins to notice all the problems she has with the city and so they plan a visit to Floyd's hometown. 
Meanwhile, Jack returns from a weekend in Paris with Phoebe, his new fiancée, and insists that Liz should get to know Phoebe better. He tells her to take Phoebe and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) on a girls' day out. As their day progresses Liz senses Phoebe is not who she claims to be. Liz's suspicions are confirmed when she covertly follows Phoebe to a restaurant and spies her holding hands with an older gentleman. This is alarming for two reasons: first, Phoebe is already engaged to Jack, and secondly, she has previously claimed to be afflicted by "Avian Bone Syndrome," a result of which is that her purportedly brittle bones would not be able to stand such intense physical contact. Even though Liz tries to remain inconspicuous at the restaurant, Phoebe notices her. Knowing that Liz is onto her deceptions, Phoebe confronts Liz. Liz is not interested in Phoebe's excuses and tells her that she has a choice: tell Jack about her cheating or Liz will do so herself. Phoebe gets angry and then shocks Liz when she drops her British accent. Liz tries to tell Jack about her suspicions, but he is quickly offended by her seemingly unfounded and slanderous comments about his fiancée, which puts a heavy strain on their working relationship.
Finally, Tracy has somehow become entangled in a character assassination plot. When Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) tells Tracy that he read in a magazine that Bill Cosby hates him, Tracy realizes that The Black Crusaders, a cabal of powerful black Americans (a reference to the 2006 conspiracy theory hoax regarding a similar group called the Dark Crusaders driving Dave Chappelle off of his Comedy Central show), are out to destroy his career. The Black Crusaders have managed to put a stop to all productions featuring Tracy. Fearing for his life, Tracy goes on the run to Cleveland and, from there, into Needmore, Pennsylvania.
Production.
This episode was the fourth episode written by Jack Burditt and also the fourth episode written by Robert Carlock. It was the first episode directed by Paul Feig. The scenes set in Cleveland, Ohio were actually filmed in Battery Park City, Manhattan. Similarly, the scenes in the town of Needmore, Pennsylvania in the following episode, "Hiatus", were filmed in Douglaston, Queens. Jason Sudeikis sings the montage when touring Cleveland.
Jason Sudeikis, who played Floyd in this episode, has appeared in the main cast of "Saturday Night Live", a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey was the head writer on "Saturday Night Live" from 1999 until 2006. Various other cast members of "Saturday Night Live" have appeared on "30 Rock". These cast members include: Rachel Dratch, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Will Forte, Chris Parnell and Molly Shannon. Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of "Saturday Night Live". Alec Baldwin has also hosted "Saturday Night Live" thirteen times, the second highest number of episodes of any host of the series.
Reception.
"Cleveland" brought in an average of 5.2 million viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States. It also achieved a 2.5/7 in the key 18–49 year old demographic. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all people of ages 18–49 years old in the U.S., and the 7 refers to 7% of all people of ages 18–49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S..
Robert Canning of IGN thought that this episode "was by far the funniest, laugh-out-loud, near genius episode of "30 Rock" this season." He wrote that "there wasn't a moment wasted in the entire half hour, which not only gave us plenty of laughs, but it continued the ongoing storylines with fantastic pacing and ease." Canning stated that "the best part of this episode by far was Tracy's paranoia over The Black Crusaders" and he rated the episode 9.7 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of "TV Guide" wrote regarding Emily Mortimer's guest appearance that "she's not the first thought for most sitcoms looking to fill a vacancy. But here, she's obviously relishing (as Isabella Rossellini did) the chance to go a bit bonkers. When she lapsed out of the accent, what fun." Anna Johns of AOL's "TV Squad" wrote that she "didn't find 'Cleveland' nearly as funny as the super-sized 'Fireworks' episode two weeks ago, but it was still pretty good. The best sources of humor in this show are Kenneth the Page and Tracy Jordan, neither of which had a very prominent role this week."

Symphony No. 7 (Haydn)

It is scored for 2 oboes, bassoon, 2 horns, strings and continuo, and exhibits many concertante features; indeed, the principal players of each of the string sections have solos, while the winds are given fairly difficult parts. The work is in four movements:
Unlike the sunrise of "Le matin", the slow introduction to the opening movement here is a ceremonial march.
The first movement begins with a fanfare style, ten bar passage, followed by the allegro part of the movement. The second adagio movement begins with an extended "recitative" in C minor featuring a solo violin. The Adagio follows in G major with solo violin and solo cello with prominent obbligato flute parts coloring the accompanying orchestration. The movement ends with an extended cadenza for the solo violin and cello.
Like the previous symphony, the finale contains numerous solo passages for almost all the instruments, but here its intensified even more with solos and tuttis often exchanging every other bar. The recapitulation is notably accentuated with horn fanfares.
