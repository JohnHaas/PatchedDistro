Mahiki

Mahiki is a London nightclub in Dover Street, near the Ritz Hotel, well known for its celebrity clientele. It is named after the Polynesian path to the underworld. Mahiki was opened in October 2006 by Piers Adam and Nick House. The club has attracted media attention as a favourite haunt of royals including Princes William and Harry to celebrities such as Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Kelly Rowland, Paris Hilton among many more. It is regularly referred to in the press as one of London's most popular clubs. Its themed Thursday nights, hosted by socialite Henry Conway, are particularly popular, with rival club owner Charlie Gilkes saying "Thursday nights at Mahiki ... are the night in London, there are queues going round the block."
Location and decor.
Mahiki is located at the corner of Dover Street and Piccadilly in the Mayfair area of London. The interior, designed and fitted by CheekyTiki Ltd has a Polynesian inspired theme. Its decor is intended to look like a tropical island paradise, where you get your drinks served in bespoke Tiki mugs. The club typically plays older music and has a retro feel.
Reputation and clientele.
Mahiki claims that it adheres to a mostly open door policy. Co-founder Nick House has said "The vision with Mahiki is that whether you're fat, thin, bald, ugly or old, you can get in. Admittedly, when it gets to 11pm, it might be more difficult. But certainly, until it reaches capacity, anyone can get in." Anna van Pragh of The Daily Mail, however has argued that while it may technically have an egalitarian door policy, in practice it has "a cross-section of the pages of Debrett's." Some papers have attributed its popularity with London's upper class in part to promotions manager Guy Pelly, who is a close friend of Princes William and Harry. However, many reviews on popular travel websites such as TripAdvisor reveal an apparently racist door policy that may exist in reality, with anecdotes of customers being turned away due to skin color.
Incidents.
During the 2012 Summer Olympics, Belgian cyclist Gijs Van Hoecke, who competed in the Men's Omnium event, was sent home by the Belgian Olympic Committee after pictures of him exiting the club drunk with liquid covering his clothes and being helplessly carried into a taxi by his teammates had surfaced in newspapers.
In October 2012, the Olympic medals of Hannah Macleod and Alex Partridge were stolen along with their jackets during a night out.

Jean de Nostredame

Jean de Nostredame (1522–1576/7) was a Provençal historian and writer. He was the younger brother of Michel de Nostredame. 
He was baptised at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence on 19 February 1522. He followed the footsteps of his father, Jaume de Nostredame, as a notary public and served as a procurator of the Cour de Parlement of Provence in Aix. 
Nostredame's major work is "Les vies des plus célèbres et anciens Poètes provensaux, qui ont floury du temps des comtes de Provence" (Lyon: Alexandre Marsilij, 1575). It presents itself as a history of the troubadours. Today it is regarded as largely fantasy, though nuggets of historical truth remain. Nostredame lists three sources for his accounts, but none of these survive. In the eighteenth century Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni was influenced by Nostredame, but in the twentieth, Camille Chabaneau and Joseph Anglade showed definitively that most of Nostredame cannot be corroborated.

Secure Network Communications

Secure Network Communications (SNC) is a software layer in the SAP Netweaver system architecture that enables the use of stronger authentication, encryption and single sign-on mechanism. SAP provides SNC for server to server communications only. Third party vendors provide SNC technology for client access, however.
SAP systems include basic security measures, which include the SAP authorization concept and user authentication based on passwords. With SNC, SAP customers can extend SAP system security beyond these basic measures to include the additional protection offered by stronger authentication methods, by encryption and by single sign-on. This tool is available for Windows and *UX Operating Systems.
SNC can be very useful for remote connections with SAP servers.

So Barbara again gave way and made Fritz marry Ruth even with a heavy heart. She stayed in the States as a hospital nurse but one day she received a call from the Philippines saying that Ruth killed herself and it was witnessed by her only daughter Karen. She quickly came to the country to mourn with her stepmother and to take care of her currently unstable niece. But when she arrived, strange things start to happen.

Victorino Mapa High School

Victorino Mapa High School () (formerly Manila East High School), situated in San Miguel, Manila, is one of the oldest public high schools in the city. It has produced a list of successful graduates in various fields since its foundation in 1923.
Along with Manila Science High School, Ramon Magsaysay High School, Manuel Roxas High School, Arellano High School, and Araullo High School, Victorino Mapa offers rigorous Special Science courses to selected top students. The institution is considered as one of the top schools in Manila in terms of its performance in achievement tests and competitions. In 2007, VMHS was named one of the cleanest schools in Manila.
History.
Victorino Mapa High School opened its first classes (Manila East High School) as one of the four schools in City of Manila together with Torres High School (Manila South High School) and Arellano High School (Manila North High School) in June 1923.
Mapa Has been under the administration of 14 principals since it was founded in June 1923. The three of these were Americans namely, John Carl, Sarah M. England and James Burns. The first Filipino principal of the School was Indolencio Madamba in 1951. In his term, the Parents-Teachers Association was organized and succession of principals took over, after Madamba retired in May 1956.
Student population of VMHS traditionally come from the district of San Miguel, Quiapo, Sampaloc and Santa Mesa consisting of family homogenous in economic and social standards with a few transferees from provinces.
Discipline, despite of the crowded rooms and economic status of the students, is well-maintained. The students, because of the strict implementation of school policies and the presence of the Supreme Student Government, are generally clean; and good attendance is still expected and even in days of suspension around the vicinity of rallies and mass action.
VMHS once had a biggest student population of 11,481 with a faculty of 488. Victorino Mapa at present boasts of a big and well-equipped auditorium (now know as ""Bulwagang Velayo"") and a more sprawling gymnasium, an elevator and well-epuipped and updated science laboratories, thus is always the venue for many educational, civic, cultural and social gatherings in the city of Manila.

Academics.
Special Science Curriculum.
The establishment of the Special Science curriculum is spearheaded by the Department of Science and Technology- Science Education Institute in the 1980s. (I think this needs re-checking) [http://www.sei.dost.gov.ph/simula.html] For the moment, support form DOST has been withdrawn and Special Science classes are maintained by the Division of City Schools in the implementing schools namely Manuel A. Roxas High School, Ramon Magsaysay High School, Victorino Mapa High School, Arellano High School and Araullo High School, with the exception of Manila Science High School which is a recognized science high school.
To be eligible for the Special Science sections, applicants must have final grades no lower than 85 in Science, Math and English and 83 in other subjects. They are subjected to examination which includes knowledge of Sciences and use of Abstract Reasoning.
Successful applicants are then provided with elective subjects to fulfill the aim of the program, which is to give the students good grounding in Science, as well as in other subject areas. Thus, students are expected to have more than 11 subjects, all while maintaining good academic standing and participating in extra curricular activities. Students who fail to maintain a GPA higher than the expected minimum grade, which is set by the school, are removed from the Special Science section the following year and are transferred to an appropriate regular section. This is also especially true for those students who receive a grade lower than 80 in any subjects being taken. 
It should be noted that various electives are limited only to Special Science students and are not offered to students of regular sections. Such subjects are the following: Computer Programming, Research, Statistics, Advance Biology (Biotechnology), Advance Chemistry, Speech Delivery and Debate, Earth and Environmental Science, Creative Writing, Pre-Calculus and Analytic Geometry, and Journalism*. 
Journalism is the only elective not required for the Special Science students to take, since they are already taking Computer Science. However, those who chose to take it otherwise may participate in various writing contests within the Manila School Division. Selected students may also represent their school at Regional Journalism contests which are conducted throughout the school year. Regular students who wish to take this subject as their elective are free to do so, and could take the class together with all SS students who are taking this also. While all Journalism student submit an article for the school paper on a regular basis, not all could get their articles get published. Those whose articles are not chosen are then responsible for the layout of the school paper and other technical stuff regarding the publishing. 
There are only two Special Science sections in Victorino Mapa High School per year level: SS1 and SS2.
Supreme Student Government (SSG).
The Supreme Student Government (SSG) of Victorino Mapa High School is the major organization and program proprietor which is headed by Ms. Perlita A. Concepcion. It promotes good welfare, good student-administration relation and launches program for student development, cleanliness, orderliness, drop-out reduction, anti-drug and smoke campaign, tutorials, seminars, peer-counseling, suggestion wall, leadership trainings and fund--raisings for charity and school programs. SSG also manages all the homeroom officers as well as the interests clubs of the school.
The current President of the SSG is Michael Angelo B. De Chavez of IV-OBB. He is also the President of the Division Federation of the Supreme Student Government of the City of Manila for the SY 2013-2014.
Last February 27, 2014, the SSG Elections was observed. After the series of canvassing, Steven Joseph S. Ricafrente of III-OBB will be the incoming President of the Supreme Student Government for the S.Y. 2014-2015. 
91st Foundation Anniversary.
Victorino Mapa High School celebrated its 91st Foundation Anniversary with the theme Sambayanan: Igalaw mo, Pagbangon mo! The celebration started with the Holy Mass which is celebrated at the Annex building together with the principal, Dr. Yolanda F. Tolentino, Ph. D., Dr. Benny M. Abante - Former Congressman of Manila and President of the Alumni Association, other guests, Deped - Manila Exectuives, department heads, faculty and students. After the mass, there was a musical scenario that shows the hope of the victims of Typhoon Yolanda. At the main building, there was an Awarding Ceremony to those teachers who served the school for twenty (20)consecutive years. After the awarding ceremony, the "Mapans" showed their talents in presenting their cultural dances at their Field Demonstrations.

2002 Bristow Helicopters Sikorsky S-76A crash

G-BJVX, a commercial Sikorsky S-76A helicopter operated by Norwich-based Bristow Helicopters, crashed in the evening of 16 July 2002 in the southern North Sea while it was making a ten-minute flight between the gas production platform "Clipper" and the drilling rig "Global Santa Fe Monarch", after which it was to return to Norwich Airport.
Accident.
The 22-year-old helicopter was flying at an altitude of about when workers on the "Global Santa Fe Monarch" heard "a loud bang". No witnesses were actually watching the aircraft at the time, but some saw it dive steeply into the sea. A witness also reported seeing the helicopter's rotor head
with rotor blades attached falling into the sea after the body of the helicopter had impacted.
The accident caused the death of all those on board (two crew members and nine Shell workers as passengers). The body of the eleventh man has never been recovered.
Search and rescue.
The rig Standby Vessel, "Putford Achilles", which was about from the
location immediately launched its two fast rescue craft, which recovered four bodies and some floating debris. The search was continued, resulting in the recovery of another body. Great Yarmouth Coastguard launched rescue helicopters and other vessels arrived on the scene that night, but no survivors or further bodies were recovered from the surface of the sea.
An underwater search for the six missing bodies began on 17 July, the debris field was located in of water by a remotely operated vehicle from the vessel "Kommandor Subsea" on 19 July. The Diving Support Vessel "Mayo" arrived later that day and began the recovery of bodies and wreckage, five more bodies being retrieved. An underwater search for the remaining missing body was eventually halted on 23 July. A surface vessel search was maintained for two more days and an aerial search until 30 July, without success.
Investigation.
The wreckage, which included the helicopter's flight data recorder, was brought ashore at Great Yarmouth on 21 July, and transferred to an Air Accidents Investigation Branch facility near Aldershot, Hampshire, where it was examined by investigators from the AAIB, the US National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, the aircraft manufacturer, and the operator.
Cause.
The audio recordings from the Cockpit voice recorder revealed that the crew were unaware of any significant abnormality until the flight from the "Clipper" platform to the "Monarch" platform. About 4.5 minutes into this flight, they discussed an increase in vibration. The non-handling pilot carried out a "rotor track and balance" procedure; the increase in vibration did not cause the crew any immediate concern and the procedure was carried out to enable the Integrated Health and Usage Monitoring System (IHUMS) to log rotor track and balance data for later analysis.
Frequency spectrum analysis of the audio recordings indicated an increase in the amplitude of frequencies associated with main rotor vibration towards the end of the recording. The recording ended abruptly with three unusual, probably structure-borne, sounds.
Wreckage analysis showed that, while three of the main rotor blades exhibited only superficial damage, the fourth was fractured at a position approximately from the blade root, while the main rotor gearbox's casing was also fractured. Neither the gearbox nor the rotor head could be recovered. The rotor blade, which had been manufactured in March 1981, had been struck by lightning in 1999, when it was repaired by the manufacturer and returned to service.
After the accident, the AAIB and the helicopter's manufacturer, Stratford, Connecticut-based Sikorsky Aircraft, reached the opinion that the electrical energy imparted by the lightning strike in 1999 exploited an anomaly that was built into the blade at manufacture and damaged the spar. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch report stated that the manufacturers should have noticed the error, unless it was permitted by concession.
Aftermath.
Shell suspended North Sea helicopter flights by the operator for six weeks after the accident until 3 September 2002. 
The inquest into the deaths opened on 31 October at the Great Yarmouth Coroner's Court and the jury returned a verdict of Accidental Death on 2 November 2005 on the basis of an AAIB report finalised during that year. 
Earlier, in late 2003, the company Bristow had agreed to a compensation deal for five children, whose fathers were killed in the crash. 
The names of the deceased are engraved on a glass porch in St Nicholas Church, Great Yarmouth. 
In 2007, a Norwich coroner's officer launched legal action over claims he suffered stress following the tragedy, claiming compensation, stating he received insufficient support at the time of the incident and in its aftermath. A Norfolk police spokesman confirmed the traumatic nature of the 2002 incident for all those involved, the more so since it had occurred on the eve of a one-day general strike of council's workers in the UK and two days before a royal visit to Norwich.

Kanjar

Kanjar is a traditionally nomadic ethnic group found in North India and Pakistan. The community is also known by the names of Nath, Marwari Kumar and Banchra . 
History.
The word kanjar has been derived from the Sanskrit "kanana-chara", which means wanderer in the jungle. They claim to have originated in Rajasthan. The Kanjar then had to flee to the jungles to avoid Mughal persecution. Since that period, they have been living in the jungle, and make their living by hunting. According to their traditions, they are descended from a Manu Guru and his wife Nathiya Kanjarin. They are divided into four clans, the Callad, Superala, Diyal and Rachhband. A fifth group, the Patharkat are now a distinct sub-group, no longer inter-marrying with the other Kanjar groupings.
A section of the Kanjar of the Punjab have converted to Islam. This community is historically associated with prostitution. The Muslim Kanjar of Punjab might have had nucleus in the Kanjar tribe, but the community has always accepted fresh recruits. Those who have followed the profession for generations are called deradars, and look down upon the latter recruits. The Kanjar also supplied the executioners during the period of Mughal and Sikh rule in the Punjab.
In the Colonial period, Kanjars were listed under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, as being a tribe "addicted to the systematic commission of non-bailable offences."
Present circumstances.
In India.
After independence, they were denotified in 1952, when the Criminal Tribes Act was replaced with the Habitual Offenders Act, but the community continues to carry considerable social stigma. In present Kanjar's are also known as Gihar which is not notified by government of India. Kanjar community is struggling for their existence. In this respect they are organizing conferences to Unite theirself. The hon'ble Retd. Joint Director C.B.C.I.D Mr. Subhash Chandra Gihar has made a lots of exercise to improve Kanjar Community 
In addition to progress of Kanjar Society one more effort has done by Mr. Vishal Anand Gihar in the guidance of Mr. Subhash Chandra Gihar, a book pulished named "Gihar Jyoti" on 28 April 2013 which is showing the progress of Gihar Community & the current updates. A woman leader of Gihar Mahila Samaj Mrs. "Manju Lata Gihar" also making efforts for her community 
The traditional occupation of the Kanjar was hunting, but over time, many took to agriculture. They still depend on the forest, extracting roots of the khas grass, and collecting reeds from banks of the rivers. From the stalks of the munji grass and from the roots of the palas tree, they make ropes which they sell in villages. The community is also involved in tanning of skins out of which drums are made and sold. Many urban Kanjar are now wage labourers and involved in rickshaw pulling.
The Kanjar community council is very strong, and exercises a strong hold over the community. This caste council resolves disputes within the community, and head by a mukhiya or chieftain, who is seen as the leader of the Kanjar. The Kanjar of India are Hindu and Sikh, and their community deity is Mana, who worshiped by all the Kanjars.
The Kanjar could speak 4-5 languages along with their secret language called Narsi-Parsi. It consists of different sounds of animals & birds, coded words and signs. 
In Rajasthan, the Kanjar are a nomadic community, and said to have been the genealogists of the Jat community. The Kanjar are found mainly in the districts of Bhilwara, Chittorgarh, Banswara and Tonk. They speak the Mewari and have been granted Scheduled Caste status. The Kanjar are further divided into twelve exogamous clans, the Bamnawat, Malvi, Karkhar, Chitrawat, Singhawat, Karmawat, Gudrawat, Jhalawat, Singauri, Suklawat, Nanawat and Singawat. Unlike other Kanjar communities, the Rajasthan are mainly a community of cultivators and agricultural labourers. The Kanjar are Hindu and pay special reverence to Mata.
In Bihar, the Kanjar are a nomadic community who are involved in trapping birds and animals, which they sell on to local traders. As a semi-nomadic community they are perceived as distinct from other settled communities. There camps are often found in the out skirts of villages. The Kanjar speak the Magadhi dialect of Hindi. They are found mainly in Madhubani and Purnea districts in Bihar.
In Pakistan.
In Pakistan, there are in fact two distinct communities that go by the name Kanjar, an urban community, which has over the centuries become associated with the profession of prostitution and a peripatetic community of craftsmen and entertainers, best known for the terracotta toys they manufacture and peddle. Both groups of Kanjar live in the province of Punjab, with former belonging to Shia sect, and the latter to Sunni sect. The term 'Kanjar' is more generally used to refer to a pimp or a person of low moral character than as a reference to an actual tribe.
The urban Kanjar.
Little is known how this nomadic jungle tribe became urbanized, and converted to Islam. The neighbourhood of Heera Mandi, in the walled city of Lahore, is the main centre of the tribe. The unmarried girls within the community are prostituted, but wives and son's wives are kept in strict seclusion. Wives have historically been purchased from other poorer communities. When a girl attains puberty and co-habits with a man for the first time, a feast called shadi missi is giving to the whole community.
The Kanjar are most famously associated with the locality of the Shahi Mohalla, within the walled city of Lahore. This has to home a large community of Kanjar for centuries. The Kanjar have also been connected with music, and many musicians in Pakistan have their roots in the Kanjar community. A recent study found that:
“A Kanjar hears the music of tabla and ghungroo from the day of her birth and must begin her formal education before her non-Kanjar friends start going to school.”
The community has a symbiotic relationship with another community, the Mirasi, who are the traditional musicians of North India and Pakistan]. In Pakistan, the Kanjar are a particularly vulnerable community, with a lifestyle that is deviant to the cultural norm of an orthodox Islamic society such as Pakistan. Their non-conventional, and often immoral, behaviour makes them subject to discrimination, and unlike India, there are no affirmative action schemes for the socially disadvantaged. Furthermore, as members of the minority Shia sect, they are additionally disadvantaged.
The nomadic Kanjar.
The nomadic Kanjar are traditionally involved in the selling of terracotta toys, which they hawk door to door in sedentary communities. They supplement this activity through begging as well as entertaining village communities by providing rides and singing traditional folk songs, while female Kanjar dance. All Kanjar trace descent from common ancestor, who was said to a sedentary agriculturist, but are unsure as to when they converted to Islam. The Kanjar speak the Kanjari language, a little studied Indo Aryan language, but almost all also speak Punjabi and Urdu.
The "puki" or camp is the basic social unit of the Kanjar society. Technically, all those who are part of the camp are related, and marriages occur with individuals of other camps, although many unrelated groups do not affiliate themselves in a camp. The Kanjar are strictly endogamous, and marriages are arranged. Intra-tent or camp disputes are resolved by senior adults, not directly involved in the dispute.
Although nomadic, the Kanjar follow a set route, and often maintain a relationship with the villages they visit. Many of the men folk are employed as agricultural labourers. Their tents are made from split bamboo or munji grass, and their ecampments can be found at the edges of villages, as well as in urban areas such as Faisalabad and Lahore.
In literature.
They are the subject of the well known Hindi story "Indrajal" (English: Magic), by Jaishankar Prasad.
In films.
In the Lollywood film "Bol", there is a prominent character Saqa Kanjar (played by Shafqat Cheema) who financially helps a fanatic hakim after the later has to bribe the police to bury the case of honour killing of his own son Saifi. The hakim in return had to bear a girl child for Saqa Kanjar's wife Meena (played by Iman Ali).

Powassan Eagles

The Powassan Eagles are a Canadian Junior ice hockey team based out of Powassan, Ontario, Canada. They play in the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League.
History.
Ville-Marie first attempted to join the Ontario junior hockey ranks in 2007, making offers to both the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League and the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League to form an expansion team. The GMHL turned down the offer due to their acceptance of a Temiscaming franchise that would have been compromised with a team in such proximity. The NOJHL looked like they were going to accept the team, but the deal fell through late summer. The NOJHL claimed that the Ville-Marie franchise would probably join them in 2008.
In the summer of 2008, the NOJHL made no mention of their interest in a Ville-Marie franchise, but courted the already established Temiscaming Royals GMHL club. Temiscaming took the bait and the Town of Ville-Marie reapplied for GMHL membership. On June 23, 2008, the GMHL officially announced the expansion of the Ville-Marie Dragons for the 2008-09 season.
Ville-Marie played their first ever game on September 12, 2008 at home against the Nipissing Alouettes. The Alouettes, who were entering their third season in the GMHL, put the boots to the expansion club 17-4. On October 16, 2008, the Dragons won their first game defeating the Oro-Medonte 77's by a score of 4-3 at home.
On January 16, 2009, the Oro-Medonte 77's posted on their website that the upcoming game between the 77's and the Dragons had been cancelled as the Dragons had folded for the season. This marks the first time that a GMHL team has folded mid-season.
On April 8, 2009, it was announced that the team had been moved to Powassan, Ontario.
On September 11, 2009, the Dragons played their first game in Powassan, a 6-3 victory over the Minden Riverkings.
In December 2009, Dragons goalie Martijn Oosterwijk played as the starting goaltender for the Netherlands in the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships Division II Pool B. He finished with a 4-1 record, leading his team to second place in their tournament and within inches of promotion to Division I.
In May 2011, the team was sold and renamed the Powassan Eagles and is getting ready for 2012/2013 season .

Patayin sa Sindak si Barbara (film)

Patayin sa Sindak si Barbara (literally Kill Barbara in Shock) is a 1995 Filipino horror-drama remake of the 1974 horror film "Patayin Mo Sa Sindak Si Barbara", directed by Chito S. Roño and released by Star Cinema.
The film also celebrated the 20th-year anniversary offering in which the film was originally released.
Plot.
Being the loving older sister, Barbara (Lorna Tolentino) has always been overly indulgent of her little sister Ruth's every whim. Years later, Barbara meets and instantly falls in love with Nick (Tonton Gutierrez), who is mutually smitten with her. But the spoiled Ruth (Dawn Zulueta) confesses to her older sister that she too is in love with Nick and threatens to kill herself if he does not marry her. So with a heavy heart, Barbara once again passively accommodates Ruth's demands and convinces Nick to court her younger sister instead. In a twisted act of devotion, Nick reluctantly agrees to marry Ruth, to prove his love for Barbara. After the wedding, Barbara then decides to start a new life abroad, to give Nick a chance to truly fall in love with Ruth and for Barbara to get over her feelings for him.
Her past comes back to haunt her (in more ways than one) when Barbara receives news that her younger sister has killed herself and was witnessed by Ruth's only daughter Karen (Antoinette Taus). Barbara immediately returns to the Philippines to mourn her sister and comfort her unstable niece. But strange events happen upon Barbara's return and she learns the reason surrounding Ruth's mysterious death.
Throughout their marriage, Ruth felt that Nick never really loved her, but instead still harboured feelings for her sister. In a state of paranoid delusion, she suspects that Nick was having an affair and used his business trips to the United States as an excuse to rendezvous with Barbara. In a jealous rage, she commits suicide and haunts the household through a doll to exact revenge on everyone who wronged her.
Production.
The majority of the visual effects used in the film were handled by Cinevideo Arts Philippines. Digital compositing was handled by Video Post.

Capsule of lymph node

The lymph node capsule is composed of dense irregular connective tissue with some plain muscle fibers, and from its internal surface are given off a number of membranous processes or trabeculæ, consisting, in man, of connective tissue, with a small admixture of plain muscle fibers; but in many of the lower animals composed almost entirely of involuntary muscle. They pass inward, radiating toward the center of the gland, for a certain distance—that is to say, for about one-third or one-fourth of the space between the circumference and the center of the gland. In some animals they are sufficiently well-marked to divide the peripheral or cortical portion of the gland into a number of compartments (so-called follicles), but in man this arrangement is not obvious. The larger trabeculæ springing from the capsule break up into finer bands, and these interlace to form a mesh-work in the central or medullary portion of the gland. In these spaces formed by the interlacing trabeculæ is contained the proper gland substance or lymphoid tissue. The gland pulp does not, however, completely fill the spaces, but leaves, between its outer margin and the enclosing trabeculæ, a channel or space of uniform width throughout. This is termed the lymph path or lymph sinus. Running across it are a number of finer trabeculæ of reticular connective tissue, the fibers of which are, for the most part, covered by ramifying cells.

Consuelo Kanaga

Consuelo Delesseps Kanaga (1894–1978) was an American photographer and writer who became well known for her photographs of African-Americans.
Life.
Kanaga was born on 15 May 1894 in Astoria, Oregon, the second child of Amos Ream Kanaga and Mathilda Carolina Hartwig. Her father was a successful lawyer and judge in Ohio. After moving to Astoria he became the district attorney for the city, and he also traveled widely, often leaving his family behind with little notice. After they moved to California in 1915 her mother became a real estate broker, a highly unusual occupation for a woman at that time. The last name "Kanaga" is of Swiss origin, and a family genealogy traces its roots back at least 250 years. She spelled her first name "Consuela," at least in the 1920s and '30s, but it is generally listed now as Consuelo, a more common Spanish name. Her middle name "Delesseps" is said to have come from her mother's admiration for Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French diplomat and developer of the Suez Canal. 
In 1911 the family moved from Oregon to Larkspur in Marin County, California. In 1915 Kanaga got a job as a reporter, feature writer and part-time photographer for the "San Francisco Chronicle." Dorothea Lange later said that Kanaga was the first female newspaper photographer she had ever encountered. It was there that she discovered Alfred Stieglitz's journal "Camera Work" and decided to become a photographer. Soon after she met Dorothea Lange, who encouraged her to take up photography as a career. Lange introduced her to the growing San Francisco Bay Area community of artistic photographers, notably Anne Brigman, Edward Weston, Francis Bruguière, and Louise Dahl-Wolf.
In 1919 she married mining engineer Evans Davidson, but they separated within two years. In 1922 she moved to New York in order to work as a photojournalist for the "New York American" newspaper. While in New York a co-worker at the newspaper, Donald Litchfield, introduced her to Alfred Stieglitz. Stieglitz worked with Kanaga to help transform her vision from photojournalism to a more artistic photographic style. By March 1923 she was living with Litchfield, although at the time she had not yet divorced Davidson. In 1924 she and Litchfield moved to California, living at times near Santa Cruz, San Francisco and Los Angeles. By the end of the year she had finalized divorce proceedings against Davidson, and she became engaged to Litchfield. The engagement lasted only six months, however, and by the end of the year they were no longer a couple.
In 1926 she met Tina Modotti, who was visiting San Francisco, and she put together a small exhibition of Modotti's photographs at the Kanaga Studio on Post Street. Aided by art patron Albert Bender, she began planning a prolonged "tour" of Europe, and in 1927 she spent the latter part of the year traveling and photographing in France, Germany, Hungary and Italy. While there she met up with Dahl, and the two of them spent many weeks traveling together.
While traveling to Tunisia in January, 1928, she met James Barry McCarthy, an Irish writer and ex-pilot, and by March they were married. In May they returned to New York City and took up residence there. Kanaga initially found work as a photographic retoucher, but within a few months she had her own darkroom and was printing the first of her many photos from Europe. In 1930 she and McCarthy moved to San Francisco, and soon she was re-established in the photographic community there.
In 1931 she met and began to employ African-American Eluard Luchell McDaniels, a young "man-of-all-trades" who worked for her as a handyman and chauffeur. She began to photograph him around her home, and as they talked she became captivated by the plight of African-Americans and their continuing fight against racism. Soon she was devoting much of her photography to images of African-Americans, their homes and their culture.
in 1932 she was invited by Weston and Ansel Adams to participate in the famous Group f/64 show at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, and she showed four prints. There is some confusion about whether Kanaga should actually be called a "member" of Group f/64. The announcement for the show at the de Young Museum listed seven photographers in Group f/64 and said "From time to time various other photographers will be asked to display their work with Group f/64. Those invited for the first showing are: Preston Holder, Consuela Kanaga, Alma Lavenson, Brett Weston." However, in 1934 the group posted a notice in "Camera Craft" magazine that said "The F:64 group includes in its membership such well known names as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Willard Van Dyke, John Paul Edwards, , Consuela Kanaga and several others." In an interview later in her life, Kanaga herself said "I was in that f/64 show with Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Willard Van Dyke and Ansel Adams, but I wasn't in a group, nor did I belong to anything ever. I wasn't a belonger."
In 1935 she moved back to New York without McCarthy, and the two apparently were divorced sometime that year. She began plans for a portfolio of African Americans and interviewed several families in Harlem with whom she hoped to live while documenting their lives. While there she encountered painter Wallace Putnam, whom she had met the last time she lived in New York. Within three months they were married. They spent part of their honeymoon visiting Alfred Stieglitz at his home at Lake George.
In 1938 she joined the Photo League, where she lectured a new generation of artistic photographers and became the leader of the Documentary Group projects, including "Neighborhoods of New York". Her photographs were printed in progressive publications of the time, including "New Masses", "Labor Defender", and "Sunday Worker". By 1940 she found teaching too restrictive, and she returned to taking photographs full time. She was actively photographing and exhibiting throughout the 1940s, 50s and 60s. In the latter decade she became very active in civil rights, and she took part in and photographed many demonstrations and marches. In 1963 she was arrested in Albany, Georgia during the Walk for Peace.
She finally seemed to have found the right romantic and creative partner in Putnam, and the two of them remained together for the rest of her life. They traveled frequently and spent the last half of the 1960s going back and forth to France.
Kanaga died on 28 February 1978, in Yorktown Heights, New York. Her entire estate amounted to $1,345 in photographic equipment, almost 2,500 negatives and 375 prints. Everything else she had given away to friends.
Photography.
Consuelo Kanaga has been called "one of America's most transcendent yet, surprisingly, least-known photographers." She had a wide range of visual interests, from pictorialism to photojournalism to portraiture to cityscape to still lifes. It's been said that the dominant theme in her work is an "abiding interest in, and engagement with, the American scene." She celebrated the human in every photo she took, whether it was images of sharecroppers and their homes in the South or found still lifes of flowers and curtains. She was also noted as a technician of the highest skills in the darkroom.
Her portraiture included many well-known artists and writers of the 1930s and '40s, including Milton Avery, Morris Kantor, Wharton Esherick, Mark Rothko and W. Eugene Smith.
Kanaga, who was white, was one of the few photographers in the 1930s to produce artistic portraits of black people. Significantly, the four prints she contributed to the first Group f/64 exhibition were all portraits of blacks, including two of Eluard Luchell McDaniel, whom she would photograph repeatedly in ensuing years. Kanaga also photographed black writers and intellectuals, among them Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen.
In 1949 she was included in the very important show "50 Photographs by 50 Photographers: Landmarks in Photographic History" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Kanaga's best-known image, "She Is a Tree of Life to Them," was given its title by Edward Steichen when he selected it for the landmark "Family of Man" exhibition in 1955. The picture, from a study of migrant workers in Florida, portrays a slender black woman, framed against a white wall, who gathers her children to her with a tender gesture.
She continued photographing through the 1960s, including a series of photographs of civil rights demonstrations in Albany, Georgia in 1963. In 1976 the Brooklyn Museum gave her a one-woman retrospective exhibition.
About her work, she said:
I could have done lots more, put in much more work and developed more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or the corner of the studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, "What have you got to say?" I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.

Alan Joyce (executive)

Alan Joseph Joyce (born 30 June 1966) is an Irish-born Australian businessman. He is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Australian airline Qantas Airways Limited.
Early life and education.
Joyce was born and raised in Tallaght, now a suburb of Dublin, but a separate village at the time of his birth. Joyce's mother was a cleaner and his father worked in a tobacco factory. Joyce and his three siblings attended university.
Joyce attended Dublin Institute of Technology and Trinity College, Dublin. He graduated with Honours, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Science (Physics and Mathematics) and a Master of Science degree in Management Science. He is a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.
Career.
Joyce worked at Aer Lingus, the flag carrier of Ireland for eight years, where he held a wide spectrum of positions in Sales, Marketing, Information Technology, Network Planning, Operations Research, Revenue Management and Fleet Planning.
In 1996 he left Aer Lingus to join the now-defunct Ansett Australia.
Then in 2000 he joined Qantas. At both Ansett Australia and Qantas, Joyce headed the Network Planning, Schedules Planning and Network Strategy functions.
Joyce was appointed CEO of Qantas subsidiary Jetstar Airways in October 2003.
Joyce became CEO of Qantas on 28 November 2008. He is a former Director of Orangestar Investment Holdings Pte Limited (holding company of Singapore-based Jetstar Asia Airways and Valuair) and Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation Joint Stock Company (in Vietnam). On 29 October 2011, as a result of continuing industrial unrest following the announcement of job losses and structural changes at Qantas, Joyce grounded the entire Qantas mainline fleet.
The Australian newspaper named Joyce the most influential business leader in 2011. Yet a poll following his controversial 2011 grounding of the Qantas fleet showed the action has increased negative public perception of the airline. In 2011 Joyce's remuneration was increased 71 per cent from $2.92 million in 2009-10 to $5.01 million and he was granted 1.7 million Qantas shares under a long-term incentive plan. Joyce's reported comments that this salary was 'conservative' were attacked by the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA)
Alan Joyce is an Ambassador of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation. 
Personal life.
Joyce is openly gay and lives in the inner-Sydney suburb of The Rocks with his partner, a New Zealand man with whom Joyce has been in a relationship since 1999. In 2011, Joyce was successfully treated for prostate cancer.

Pignut Mountain

Pignut Mountain is a mountain in Rappahannock County, Virginia. It is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Its summit lies within Shenandoah National Park.
Geology.
Geologically speaking, the mountain is situated in the northern subprovince of the Blue Ridge Province of the Appalachian Highlands. It is part of the Crystalline Appalachians. Pignut Mountain is separated from the main Blue Ridge by a low gap. The gap is the result of relatively rapid erosion along a geological fault.
Visiting Pignut Mountain.
Pignut Mountain is entirely undeveloped. There are no trails or roads leading up the mountain. The summit can be reached by bushwhacking from the Hull School Trail, accessible from Skyline Drive. The closest scenic viewpoints along Skyline Drive from which to view Pignut Mountain are Thornton Hollow Overlook, situated on nearby Neighbor Mountain, Little Devils Stairs Overlook on Hogback Mountain and Rattlesnake Point Overlook on Sugarloaf. Thornton Hollow Overlook provides a view from the west; Little Devils Stairs Overlook provides a view from the north; and Rattlesnake Point Overlook provides a view from the northwest.

Gaius Julius Alexander

Gaius Julius Alexander () was a Herodian Prince that lived in the 1st century and 2nd century in the Roman Empire.
Alexander was of Jewish, Nabataean, Edomite, Greek, Armenian and Persian ancestry. He was the son of the Herodian Prince, later king Tigranes VI of Armenia and his wife Opgalli. His father in the spring of 58 was crowned as king of Armenia by Roman Emperor Nero in Rome and ruled until 63. Alexander had a sister called Julia, who married the Anatolian Roman Senator Marcus Plancius Varus.
Alexander's paternal grandparents were the Judean Prince Alexander and his unnamed wife. Through his father, Alexander was the great-grandson of Cappadocian Princess Glaphyra and Judean Prince Alexander. He was the great-great-grandson of king Archelaus of Cappadocia, king of Judea Herod the Great and his wife Mariamne. Alexander along with his sister and father were the last of the known descendants of the kings of Cappadocia. Prior to the year 58, little is known on Alexander's life. He was an apostate to Judaism. It is unlikely that he attempted to exert influence on Judean Politics.
Tigranes had arranged with king Antiochus IV of Commagene, who he was an ally to when he was crowned king, to marry Alexander to Antiochus' daughter Julia Iotapa. The betrothal was held in Rome after Tigranes' coronation. The marriage was mostly a political alliance that occurred between the fathers of Alexander, Iotapa and possibly Nero. After the betrothal, Nero crowned Alexander and Iotapa as Roman client rulers of the small Cilician region of Cetis, that had previously been ruled by Alexander's Seleucid ancestors, his ancestor Archelaus of Cappadocia, the son of this, Archelaus of Cilicia, and Antiochus IV. The Cilician city of Elaiussa Sebaste was made a part of their kingdom. Alexander and Iotapa ruled Cetis from 58 until at least 72.
Little is known on the marriage and reign of Alexander and Iotapa. Iotapa bore Alexander three children: two sons Gaius Julius Agrippa, Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus and a daughter Julia Iotapa. Their children were born and raised in Cetis. A possible descendant from their marriage was the usurper Jotapianus, who lived in the 3rd century. His name and the names Alexander gave his sons indicate that their family connections from the Herodian Dynasty were not wholly broken. In Vespasian’s reign (69-79) or Titus’ reign (79-81), Alexander had entered the Roman Senate; had reached and served either as a consul or suffect consul during Trajan’s reign before 109.

Charles Sidney Winder (October 18, 1829 – August 9, 1862), was a career United States Army officer and a Confederate general officer in the American Civil War. He was killed in action during the Battle of Cedar Mountain.
Early life and career.
Winder was born in the town of Easton in Talbot County, Maryland, a nephew of future U.S. naval officer Franklin Buchanan and a second cousin to future Confederate general John H. Winder. He attended St. John's College, also located in Maryland. Then in 1846 he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated 22nd of 44 cadets in 1850. He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. Exactly a year after leaving West Point, Winder was promoted to second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery on July 1, 1851.
Winder served as the 3rd's Regimental Adjutant from April 4, 1854 to March 3, 1855, with a promotion to first lieutenant coming on April 5, 1854. In 1854, while en route to California, the vessel on which he was aboard, the "San Francisco", was struck by a hurricane. For his valor in the face of this crisis, Winder was promoted to captain in the 9th U.S. Infantry on March 3, 1855, at the relatively young age of twenty-six.
He later saw action against Native Americans in the Washington Territory. At the outbreak of hostilities between North and South, he resigned from the Army in 1861.
Civil War service.
Winder resigned his U.S. Army commission on April 1, 1861, and was appointed a captain of artillery in the Confederate Army on March 16, and then quickly promoted to major later that day. He was appointed colonel of the 6th South Carolina Infantry on July 8, leading it to prominence in the Confederate army.
He was promoted to brigadier general on March 1, 1862, and assigned to the Shenandoah Valley under the command of Stonewall Jackson. Having recently court-martialed Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett, Jackson placed Winder in command of his old brigade. This, combined with Winder's reputation as a strict disciplinarian, was widely resented by both the officers and men now under him. In fact, so general was the feeling of animosity toward him, by August 1862 it was widely rumored Winder would be shot by one of his own men in the next battle.
Cedar Mountain and death.
On August 9, 1862, Winder led his men into battle at Cedar Mountain, on the left flank of the Confederate line. He did so despite having been ill for several days, and in defiance of a surgeon's order to rest. He was personally directing the fire of a battery when a Union shell struck him in his left side, horribly mangling him. Borne to the rear on a stretcher, Winder died later that evening.
Winder's body was initially buried in nearby Orange Court House, before being disinterred and transported to Richmond. There, a state funeral was given in his honor, followed by re-interment at Hollywood Cemetery. Three years later, his family had his body again removed, this time to be permanently buried in the family cemetery at Wye House, located near his birthplace of Easton, Maryland.
In his official report of the battle, Stonewall Jackson lamented General Winder's loss, writing,

Notable Moments.
Michael Jackson and Jarvis Cocker.
Michael Jackson was given a special Artist of a Generation award. At the ceremony he accompanied his single "Earth Song" with a stage show, culminating with Jackson as a 'Christ-like figure' surrounded by children. Jarvis Cocker, of the band Pulp, mounted the stage in what he would later claim as protest at this portion of the performance. Cocker ran across the stage, lifting his shirt and pointing his (clothed) bottom in Jackson's direction. Cocker was subsequently questioned by the police on suspicion of causing injury towards three of the children in Jackson's performance, who were now on stage. No criminal proceedings followed. This was Jackson's penultimate performance in the UK before his death in 2009 - the final performance being at Wembley Stadium in 1997.
Oasis and Blur.
1996 saw the height of a well-documented feud between Britpop rivals, Oasis and Blur . The differing styles of the bands, coupled with their prominence within the Britpop movement, led the British media to seize upon the rivalry between the bands. Both factions played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the ceremony by singing a rendition of "Parklife" when they collected their "Best British Band" award (with Liam changing the lyrics to "Shite-life").

During the ceremony, boy band A1 picked up the 'Award for Best Newcomer'. At the end of the night, Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher walked onto stage to present U2 with their 'Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music'. As Gallagher took the microphone at the start of his presenting speech, he said "This award ceremony over the years has been accused of not having a sense of humour, but when you see A1 winning best newcomer, you know that someone's taking the piss somewhere". A1 were apparently offended, and in April 2001 they performed a cover version of the Oasis song "Don't Look Back in Anger" in a mocking way, live using instruments, and not a backing track, as Gallagher had also called the band "manufactured".

Eupatorium serotinum

Eupatorium serotinum, also known as late boneset or late thoroughwort, is a fall-blooming herbaceous plant native to North America. Like other members of the genus "Eupatorium", it is about one to two meters tall and has inflorescences containing a large number of white flowers with disc florets and no ray florets.
It ranges throughout most of the eastern United States, as far south as Mexico (near the Texas border), as far north as the United States–Canadian border, and as far west as Nebraska and Texas.
It grows in open sites (either dry or moist), and can hybridize with "Eupatorium perfoliatum" and other members of the genus "Eupatorium". Unlike wind-pollinated plants in this genus, "E. serotinum" is pollinated by insects.

William Henry Knight

William Henry Knight (26 September 1823 – 31 July 1863) was an English portrait and genre painter.
Life and work.
Knight was born in Newbury, Berkshire where his father, John Knight, was a schoolmaster. He was to become a solicitor, but gave up his law studies after two of his paintings were accepted by the annual exhibition of the Society of British Artists. He moved to London in 1855, taking lodgings in Kennington Road, Lambeth, and supporting himself by drawing crayon portraits while studying in the British Museum and in the schools of the Royal Academy.
Following in the footsteps of William Mulready, he became a genre painter, his street scenes and interior scenes often showing children at play. His first contribution to the Royal Academy exhibition was "Boys playing draughts" in 1846; from that year until 1862 he was a constant exhibitor there. He also showed many pictures at the British Institution.
Among his best works were: "A Christmas party preparing for blind man's buff" (1850); "Time for play", "Boys snowballing" (1853); "The broken window" (1855 - engraved for the August 1865 edition of The Art Journal); "The village school" (1857); "Knuckle down" (1858); "The lost change" (1859); "Hide and seek" (1860); "The game of marbles", "An unexpected trump" (1861); "Rivals to Blondin" and "The counterfeit coin" (1862). Many engravings were made from his works. In his 1855 "Academy notes", John Ruskin wrote about "The broken window": "This picture does not catch the eye at a distance, but, on looking close, there will be found exquisite and careful painting in it.".
Knight died on 31 July 1863, leaving a widow and six children.

Mount Blanco is a small white hill — an erosional remnant — located on the eastern border of the Llano Estacado within Blanco Canyon in Crosby County, Texas. It is the type locality of the Blanco Formation and Blancan Fauna, which occurs throughout North America.
Geology.
The term "Blanco Canyon beds", later shortened to "Blanco beds", was first applied to this formation in 1890 by William F. Cummins of the Geological Survey of Texas. The Blanco beds are considered to be of lacustrine origin – deposited in a Pleistocene lake basin set in the Ogallala formation of Pliocene age which underlies the upper surface sediments of the Llano Estacado. The thickness of the Blanco beds varies from around thick at the most. The formation mainly consists of light-gray fine-grained mudstone, sandstone, and some conglomerate. These light-colored sediments contrast sharply with the rust-colored sediments of the Ogallala Formation.
Fossil Fauna.
All fossil fauna from Mount Blanco modified from Dalquest (1975) unless otherwise noted.

At the 2006 census, it and the neighbouring township of Yambuk and the surrounding area had a population of 540.
It is the site of Pacific Hydro’s Yambuk Wind Farm and the adjacent Codrington Wind Farm.
Codrington is notable for the wind farm and for being the only township in Australia to be named after a bushranger. In 1850 Victorian bushranger Henry Garratt used the alias "Codrington Revingstone" when he held up the Portland to Port Fairy mail coach three times causing the area to become known as "Codrington's Forest".
In the 1870s a township was surveyed on the projected road to Portland close to the coast at and named Codrington after the surveyed parish in the County of Villiers which had been earlier named as Codrington.
A road was later built inland and the township was never populated.
Codrington Post Office opened on 19 August 1878 and closed in 1966.

The Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio Passenger Terminal is a historic train station in Mobile, Alabama, United States. Architect P. Thorton Mayre designed the Mission Revival style terminal for the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. It was completed in 1907 at a total cost of $575,000. The Mobile and Ohio merged with the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad in 1940 to form the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad. Passenger service was discontinued by the late 1950s, and the building served as railroad offices. The terminal was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 15, 1975. It had suffered neglect, extensive interior alteration, and partial removal of the train shed by this time. The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad vacated the building in 1986 and for fifteen years it suffered from demolition-by-neglect. The Alabama Historical Commission and the Alabama Trust for Historic Preservation named it as one of their "Places in Peril" in 1996. In 2001 the City of Mobile and a private company invested more than $18 million to restore the local landmark with the developer taking advantage of the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentive program. Today the building houses private offices and the city's Metro Transit Authority.

North Shore Rescue

North Shore Rescue is a non-profit organization dedicated to wilderness search and rescue around Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It consists of a team of approximately 40 volunteers who perform an average of 79 search and rescue operations each year, mostly in the rugged, steep, and thickly forested North Shore Mountains. North Shore Rescue assists hikers, skiers, snowshoers, mountain bikers, and others who are reported to be lost or in distress. It also provides education on mountain safety, and some services in urban search and rescue.
History.
North Shore Rescue formed in September 1965, originally with the intention of preparing to assist in the event of an urban nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. After the threats of the Cold War subsided, the group transitioned to wilderness search and rescue tasks. The team has since been involved in more than 1000 mountain search and rescue operations. Injuries or deaths were involved in approximately 25% of calls. As extreme sports and other wilderness activities have become more popular in the region, the need for rescues has risen dramatically, with call volume tripling between 1995 and 2005.
Operations.
North Shore Rescue volunteers respond at the discretion of police, often after family members or friends call 9-1-1 to report that someone has failed to return from an outing in the mountains. Because the North Shore Mountains are very close to Vancouver, the dangers of their terrain and weather are often underestimated. Underpreparation and recklessness are factors in many incidents.
In addition to searching on foot, the team sometimes uses a Helicopter Flight Rescue System, in which a volunteer is lowered from a helicopter via a rope to evacuate a stranded and/or injured person.
The team has an annual budget of approximately $250,000, which covers team equipment, fuel, and medical supplies. Its budget is covered in part by government funding, however the organization also relies on fundraising and private donations. All operations are provided free of charge to the lost or injured persons involved. The group's position is based in the belief that charging for rescues could encourage people to delay in calling for assistance, and even occasionally lead to subjects hiding from rescuers in order to avoid being charged.
The group concentrates its efforts in the 480 km2 area of the North Shore Mountains near Vancouver. However, its skills and equipment are occasionally called into play by other agencies looking for missing persons. Sgt. Ron Fairweather of the Vancouver Police Department has said, "They're an awesome unit, the equipment they have is phenomenal. We don't have the extent of equipment they have access to. And their expertise is second to none."
Volunteers.
The all-volunteer team is made up of highly skilled hikers, mountaineers and backcountry skiers, some of whom dedicate more than 500 hours per year and often conduct rescues at night, in bad weather, and on short notice. The team trains together every fourth weekend and every Tuesday night. Volunteers also attend special courses, devote time to education and fundraising, and pay for their own personal equipment and clothing. Recruiting and retaining skilled volunteers is an ongoing challenge, and in 2007, the "Vancouver Courier" reported that the team's most experienced leaders were nearing retirement age.
Some volunteers have served for decades, and as of 2007 the team included three father-son pairs.
In 2005, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of North Shore Rescue, a group including team members set out to climb Mount Logan. The expedition nearly became a tragedy after a severe storm hit, trapping three team members on an exposed ridge. All were rescued, although one team member suffered severe frostbite.
In 2008, team members Tim Jones and Gord Ferguson received a Royal Canadian Mounted Police commendation for their role in saving the life of a snowshoer in a three-day-long rescue operation on Mount Seymour.

International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances

The International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances (ICAED) gathers organizations of families of disappeared and human rights NGOs working in a nonviolent manner against the practice of enforced disappearances at the local, national and international level.
The ICAED is promoting the early ratification and effective implementation of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 20, 2006. 
The ICAED was founded officially in September 2007 during a side event to the Human Rights Council session in Geneva. The ICAED forms the next phase in the international cooperation of all those working towards better protection from enforced disappearances. The Latin American federation of family member organisations FEDEFAM debated the possible project of a convention already in their 1982 congress in Lima. In that same year several eminent lawyers, such as Eduardo Novoa Monreal of Chile and Alfredo Galletti of Argentina, drafted the first text for a Convention against enforced disapparances.
During the negotiations for the convention from 2001 to 2003 in Geneva in the 'Open ended working group to draft a legally binding instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance' family members of disappeared from all continents and international human rights NGOs such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, ICJ and FIDH cooperated on an ad hoc basis to convince UN member States to adopt the stronget possible text. 
After the adoption of the text by this working group on September 23 2005 and later the adoption of the General Assembly the attention shifted from the level of the United Nations to the national level. Ratification by all governments was the next phase. Because of the ambiguous position of some governments towards the convention the ICAED was founded to organise an international campaign for the convention. 
By March 2009 the ICAED has more than 40 member organisations that come from all around the world. National campaigns for the Convention have been developed in various countries. The Country by Country Ratification Campaign, which was launched in March 2009 with successful actions on Morocco, is the latest of the joined activities of the coalition members.

Shatabhisha

Shatabhisha, also known as Chathayam or Sadayam (Devanagari: शतभिषा)(), or "Shatabhishak" or "Shatataraka" is the 24th "nakshatra" in Hindu astronomy. It corresponds to the star γ Aquarii. The ruling planet of this nakshatra is Rahu.
Guna.
manushya
Characteristics.
Jyotiṣa states that the constellation through which the moon is passing during the time of a person’s birth has an effect on the personality traits later in life. The moon in Shatabhisha indicates a person who is a good healer or doctor, and who is mystical, meditative, philosophical, scientific and a visionary. However, they can also be secretive, reclusive, moody, depressed, opinionated and stubborn; and suffer setbacks in relationships and marriage as a result.
Female Natives 
1. Physical features: Tall and lean, fairly handsome, elegant disposition. Flushy lips and broad cheeks with prominent temples and buttocks.
2. Character and general events: She will be very calm natured. But at certain times she is also hot-tempered. She is very much inclined in the religious activities as she is god fearing. Due to her hot-temperament, she is mostly confronted with family quarrel and this will result in frequent lack of mental peace 
She has very good memory. She is highly sympathetic and generous. While she does not expect anything in return for her humanitarian action, she is quite often misunderstood not only by the general public but also by her own family members 
3. Education, sources of income/profession: Interested in the scientific study. Percentage wise assessment shows that most of the female doctors are born in this Nakshatra 
4. Family life: While she loves and adore her husband, her life will be full of problems. They are also known to be highly opinioned, and usually not tolerant of new ideas or opinions of others. They are also extremely stubborn. This may be one of the reason they often suffer setback in relationships and marriage. Marriage to a Rohini would bring comfort, even though at the beginning things might seem a bit off - they will eventually settle down admirably. Shatabhishak belongs to "Kumbh Rasi" and Rohini belongs to "Vrishabh rasi". She should learn to become more flexible and tolerant in life in order to have successful relationships. 
5. Health: Her health will be a cause of concern for her. Urinary and uterus disorders have been noticed. She may also suffer from colic troubles and chest pain
Male Natives

2. Character and general events: He is of the type "Satyameva Jayate". He will not hesitate to sacrifice his own life for upholding the truth. As he is born with certain principles, he has to quite often confront with others as he cannot deviate from his principles of life. Selfless service is his motto. He insists on following the religious traditions. He is also of the adamant type. Once he takes a decision it is not easy for others to change his decision. While he is very intelligent and efficient in most of the walks of life, he is very soft in his heart. He is the mixture of good and bad 
When he is provoked, he will rise like a bulldog, but that anger is soon subsided. As he does not believe in pomp and show, he has a feeling of shyness to exhibit his talents. However, his talents will be unearthed due to his interesting and attractive conversation, which will be highly instructive and educative 
3. Education, sources of income/profession: Period up to 34 years of age will be a trial some period in his profession field. Period after 34 years will be the period of constant progress. He is highly suited for the practice of astrology, psychology and healing arts. His literary capacity and greatness will come to limelight even when he is very young. He is capable of acquiring very fine and high education. This Nakshatra has produced eminent doctors and research fellows in medicines 
4. Family life: Generally he has to face a lot of problems from his dear and near ones. Even then, he always extents his helping hand to his near and dears even without asking for such help. It has been noticed that native has to undergo maximum mental agony due to his brothers. He cannot also enjoy much benefit from his father, whereas full love and affection is derived from his mother or Beloved Wife. His Cultures are like God Rama.
It has also been found that he is not capable of leading a happy married life. In some cases, when there is severe affliction of Saturn and Jupiter, it has been found that the native remains a chronic bachelor throughout his life. While on the one hand he does not enjoy happy married life, his wife will have all the good qualities that are expected of a companion 
5. Health: Outwardly he may appear to have very good health but it is not like that. He cannot tolerate even the slightest affliction to the body. He is prone to urinary diseases, breathing trouble and diabetics. As he is too much inclined in the sexual pleasures, he may have sexually transmitted diseases.

The Myth of National Defense

The Myth of National Defense is a book edited by Hans-Hermann Hoppe, published in 2003 by the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and contributed to by various anarcho-capitalist and libertarian authors, about the merits of replacing government defense agencies with private defense agencies. Hoppe himself argues that it is dangerous to give monopoly power over the use of force to any entity, as there is then nothing to prevent it from being abused. The chapter by Larry J. Sechrest argues that privateering provides historical examples of how private defense forces were actually superior to government naval forces in many ways, including the well-being of the sailors; the less destructive nature of this sort of conflict; etc. Contrasting the book to Hoppe's "", Andy Duncan, notes, "Its one drawback is that it does lack the organic unity of the Professor's earlier book on democracy, mainly because he failed to write the whole thing himself."

Aharon of Karlin (II)

Aaron Ben Asher of Karlin (June 6, 1802 – June 23, 1872), known as Rabbi Aaron II of Karlin, was a famous rabbi of the Ḥasidim in northwestern Russia.
Thousands of followers used to visit him annually, about the time of the Jewish New Year, as is the custom among that sect, and he was highly esteemed by his adherents. He "reigned" in Karlin, near Pinsk, in the government of Minsk (currently in Belarus), in succession to his father and his grandfather, Aaron ben Jacob.
A few years before his death he had a quarrel with a family of Karlin and removed from there to Stolin, a town several miles distant. Considering the amount of business that the yearly influx of strangers brought to the city where he resided, his removal was regarded as a misfortune for Karlin. He died, aged seventy years and seventeen days, in Malinovka, near Dubno, in Volhynia, while on a journey to the wedding of his granddaughter, and was succeeded by his son, Asher of Stolin. Asher died in Drohobycz about one year after the death of his father, and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, the so-called Yenuḳa (Baby) of Stolin, against whose rabbinate (in the Ḥasidic sense) Schatzkes — or, according to others, Judah Lob Levin (called Yehallel of Kiev) — under the pseudonym "Ḥad min Ḥabraya" (One of the students), wrote a satire in "Ḥa-Shaḥar" (vi. 25-44).
Aaron is the author of "Bet Aharon" ("Aaron's House"; Brody, 1875), which contains his cabalistic and ethical expositions of the Pentateuch. It also contains the writings of his grandfather, of his father, and of his son.
Aaron's daughter, Miriam, married Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (1820–1883), the first Rebbe of the Sadigura Hasidic dynasty.

7.7 cm FK 96

The 7.7 cm Feldkanone 96 (7.7 cm FK 96) was a field gun used by Germany before World War I.
History.
It was a thoroughly conventional gun, being a modernized version of Krupp's FK 73 gun, but failed to incorporate any recoil system other than a partially effective spade brake, and fired a 12 pound projectile. Thus it was rendered obsolete when the French introduced their Canon de 75 modèle 1897 the following year. Most guns were rebuilt to modern standards (only the barrel was retained) in 1904 as the 7.7 cm FK 96 n.A. (neuer Art) model which served throughout World War I as one of Germany's main light field guns. The remaining unmodified guns were then known as the 7.7 cm FK 96 a.A. (alte Art or old model).
A number of 7.7 cm Feldkanone C/96 (FK 96 a/A) guns were sold to the Boer republic of Transvaal. These guns were used against the British in the Second Boer War between 1899 and 1902.

The artwork for "Eagleheart" was parodied in the third season of the eponymous US television series which is otherwise unrelated to the song. The third season is subtitled "Paradise Rising" in reference to the title of a triple album of progressive rock music featured in the seventh episode, "Quint".

Media of Niger

Media in Niger is a diverse collection of public and private entities, both print and broadcast, centered in the capitol of Niamey, but with vibrant regional centers. The media has historically been state funded, and focused on radio broadcast media, as the nation's population is spread over great distances. Niamey boasts scores of newspapers and magazines, many of which are fiercely critical of the government. These papers though have very small circulations, and almost none outside the cities. A majority of Niger's population live in rural communities, are relatively poor and are illiterate. Consequently radio, in contrast to print or more expensive television is the primary source of information and entertainment amongst most Nigeriens. More than a dozen public and private radio networks broadcast across the more populated south of the nation. Many are highly critical of the government. Despite this, there is a strong government regulatory regime, and this combined with strong libel laws, have seen many journalists arrested and private media shut down during the 2000s.
History.
While the first newspapers were founded in the 1950s, until the end of military rule in the early 1990s, print and broadcast media were limited to government controlled outlets. With the coming of democracy in the 1991-1993 period, many print news sources were founded, mostly in the capitol of Niamey and most weekly publications. From 1994, private radio stations began to appear. As illiteracy rates are high and distances around the nation are great, radio has become the primary medium for entertainment and information. State, private, and international satellite television has also begun to appear in the 2000s. Free media was suspended following the 1996 and 1999 coups, with the short Fourth Republic of 1997-1999 imposing severe restrictions on media. Since the re-installation of democracy in 1999, Nigerien media has been judged independent of central government control by international observers, although since the advent of the Tuareg rebellion of 2007-2008 Niger has seen harsh local and national restrictions on journalists.
Print.
The government publishes a French-language daily newspaper, Le Sahel, and its weekend edition. There are approximately 12 private French-language weekly or monthly newspapers, some of which are affiliated loosely with political parties, and most of which appeared with the formation of the Third Republic in the early 1990s. Most prominent are the daily La Nouvelle Tribune du Peuple, the weeklies Le Républicain, La Canard Dechaine, Infos de l'Air, the fortnightly l'Evenement, L'Observateur and Haské.
Radio.
Radio is the most important medium, as television sets are beyond the buying power of many of the rural poor, and illiteracy prevents print media from becoming a mass medium. In addition to the national and regional radio services of the state broadcaster ORTN, there are several privately owned radio networks which total more than 100 stations. Anfani FM, Radio Sarounia, Radio et Musique, Radio Tambara, and Radio Tenere are urban based commercial format FM networks in the major towns. These private radio stations generally are less critical of government actions than are the private newspapers. These stations broadcast programs in French as well as local or regional languages, including Djerma and Hausa. Radio Anfani and Radio et Musique presented news coverage that has included a variety of points of view. Radio Sarounia has presented regular news coverage. It's news director, Moussa Kaka, was arrested by the government in 2007 for interviewing Tuareg rebel leaders and held awaiting trial for more than a year. The other private domestic radio stations are smaller and offer little domestic news programming.
There is also a network of over 80 community radio stations spread across all seven regions of the country, governed by the Comité de Pilotage de Radios de Proximité (CPRP), a civil society organisation. The independent sector radio networks are collectively estimated by CPRP officials to cover some 7.6 million people, or about 73% of the population (2005).
Aside from Nigerien radio stations, the BBC Hausa service is listened to on FM repeaters across wide parts of the country, particularly in the south, close to the border with Nigeria. Radio France Internationale also rebroadcasts in French through some of the commercial stations, via satellite.
Tenere also runs a national independent television station of the same name.
Regulation.
Regulation of Media in Niger is carried out by the High Council for Communication, a body appointed by the government and overseen by the Ministry of Communication. The CSC issues all licenses and press credentials, and forms the "Council of the Press", a journalism accrediting body. The CSC is the only body legally allowed to close media outlets, establish bans on reporting, and license television, radio, and newspaper reporting. It also oversees and disburses government funding for private media, through its "press assistance fund". It distributes press passes and accredits journalists. Its functioning under the Third Republic was questioned, due to a perceived lack of resources. Journalists observing the CSC contrasted the vast, if vague scope of the CSC's powers with its lack of personnel and funding, rendering it "unable to exercise its numerous powers", and charging that this served the interest of political control of the media.
Under the Fifth Republic it further is responsible for creating a professional committee of journalism in Niger, which in turn creates the "Charter of Professional Journalists of Niger" ("Charte des Journalistes professionnels du Niger"). This is the code which the CSC then uses to oversee and sanction the professional behaviour of journalists.
Press Freedom.
Despite instances of arrest and detention of journalists, West African observers generally judge Nigerien press to be independent and lively in attacking the government. Nigerien journalists say they are often pressured by local authorities. The north, under a state of emergency, has become a no-go zone for foreign press, and the independent "Radio Agadez" in the north has been closed by the government.
Since mid-2007, there have been a number of arrests of foreign and local journalist. Two local journalists were imprisoned in 2007 under charge of aiding the Tuareg insurgency in the north, and several radio stations have been closed. The journalist Moussa Kaka was held over a year on charges stemming from a radio interview of Rebel leaders, before being provisionally released. Foreign journalist circulated and reported freely prior to mid-2007, but since have been restricted from reporting on or traveling to the north of the country (Agadez Region). Since this time radio re-broadcasts of foreign news services have been restricted, having previously been a staple of Nigerien news coverage.
Legally, there are two instruments used regulate press behavior. Libel laws may be used against writers and publishers of material, either by the injured party or the government. The CSC is the only government agency with the legal power to close radio stations, and it may do so only after receiving a complaint. Despite this, as recently as 2005 the government have closed radio outlets without recourse to the CSC. In this case, a private radio station publicised protests to tax increases, and although initial police closures were overturned, the CSC ordered the station to refrain from broadcasting political news, sports coverage, or commercials. Since the beginning of the 2007 Tuareg insurgency in the north, the CSC has closed a number of outlets, and pronounced blanket bans on coverage of certain topics in the media, and of reporting from the northern part of the nation. Specific stations have been suspended for the content of their coverage, the topics discussed in on air debates, or simply for reporting on the conflict in the north. Amnesty International has complained that these measures are in violation of Niger's commitments to International Law. In 2009, Reporters Without Borders and the International Federation of Journalists accused the government on Niger of carrying out harassment of Nigerien journalists, following three high profile arrests and libel cases brought against newspapers by members of the government and the arrest of two officials of Dounia TV for comments made by others on their station. Dounia, the only non-governmental Nigerien Television News station, has been accused of giving air time to supporters Hama Amadou, an imprisoned ruling party rival of the President of Niger. RSF claimed that "The Dounia group is the victim of repeated harassment by the judicial authorities".
Religious broadcasting.
The Islamic Association of Niger, which acts as an official advisory committee to the government on religious matters, broadcasts biweekly on the government controlled television station. On government controlled media, Christian programs generally are broadcast only on special occasions, such as Christmas and Easter, although the independent media regularly broadcast such programs. Regulations from 2007 of the High Council for Communication, the body which licenses all broadcasts, includes a ban on all "purely political or confessional broadcasters".
State media.
The government-owned Radio Voix du Sahel radio transmits 14 hours per day, providing news and other programs in French and several local languages. Tele-Sahel, ORTN's television station transmits to all urban centers.
The state ORTN network depends financially on the government, partly through an addition to electricity bills and partly through direct subsidy. The High Council for Communication also maintains a fund which supports private broadcasters, although its payments are criticised as political and irregular.

Hampden Football Netball League

The Hampden Football Netball League is based in South-Western Victoria, with clubs located in towns located along or near the Princes Highway from Camperdown to Portland. The league is a major country league. It comprises an amalgamation of the Hampden Football League with the women's netball league with the same teams and playing draw.
History.
The "Hampden Football League" was formed in 1930, when the four founding clubs broke away from the Western District FL.
Terang and Camperdown did not want to continue to travel to Hamilton because their players were farmers who could not spend all day away from
the farm to play football, as they had cows to milk. Mortlake agreed with Camperdown and Terang and resigned from the WDFL. Cobden was left with a predicament, and requested admittance to the new league.
In 1933, South Warrnambool and Warrnambool joined the league, as takings at the gate had been greater when playing Camperdown or Terang that against any team in the WDFL.
Colac and Port Fairy were admitted in 1949. Memories for the politics that caused the rift in 1930 meant that the founding clubs were reluctant to allow the shift in power westward. So they allow one club to the west and one to the east. This was repeated in 1961, when they again admitted one western club (Koroit) and one from the east (Coragulac).
Colac and Coragulac merged to form Colac-Coragulac in 1980. In 1986 they dropped Coragulac from the club's name, then in 2001 Colac left the Hampden league to join the Geelong FL.
North Warrnambool were admitted to the league in the 1997 season.
In 1999, Mortlake and Derrinallum merged to form the Western Lions, however the club was not successful and folded during the 2000 season. Mortlake then attempted a new merger with Terang, which has proven successful and continues to the current day, with matches played in both towns. 
In 2013 teams from regional centres Hamilton and Portland will compete.

DRG Class 62

The German Class 62 engines were standard (see "Einheitsdampflokomotiven") passenger train tank locomotives with the Deutsche Reichsbahn.
The Class 62s were developed and delivered by the firm of Henschel for the Reichsbahn during the 1920s. The engines were two-cylinder superheated steam locomotives. A total of 15 units were manufactured. Although the engines were built as early as 1928, the Deutsche Reichsbahn did not take over numbers 62 003–015 until 1932. The reason for that was the low priority for such engines in the Reichsbahn, as well as the high cost. During the 1930s they were stationed at the locomotive depots ("Bahnbetriebswerke" or "Bw") of Düsseldorf marshalling yard, Sassnitz on the island of Rügen and Meiningen. After the Second World War eight examples were left in the hands of the DR in East Germany and seven with the Deutsche Bundesbahn. 
Up to 1967 the engines in the GDR were distributed around various depots including, for example, Meiningen, Berlin Ostbahnhof and Rostock. The engines also spent a short while in Wittenberge and Berlin-Lichtenberg depots. Number 62 007 was stationed from 8 April to 6 May 1967 in Schwerin, but was only stored there. In 1968 they were assembled at Frankfurt (Oder) shed. There the engines hauled trains on the Frankfurt (Oder)-Erkner route. At the beginning of 1970 only numbers 62 007, 62 014 and 62 015 were still in operation, in the Est Wriezen where they headed trains to Berlin-Lichtenberg. Number 62 007 was retired there in 1972, the last engine in schedule services, but continued to be used as a heating engine until 1973. The only surviving locomotive, no. 62 015, is today owned by the DB (Nuremberg Transport Museum) and is housed in the locomotive shed of the former Dresden-Altstadt depot. Until 1997 the engines was used to haul for special trains.
Immediately after the war, after they had been sent to Wuppertal, the Deutsche Bundesbahn homed its vehicles at Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen and Krefeld. By 1956 the DB's Class 62s had been taken out of service. The last engine, 62 003, was retired in 1968 in Schwerte, after it had served as an instructional model from 1956 to 1966 in the engine driver school in Troisdorf.

Human trafficking in Senegal

Senegal is a source, transit, and destination country for children and women trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Trafficking within the country is more prevalent than trans-border trafficking and the majority of victims are children. Within Senegal, religious teachers traffic boys, called talibe, by promising to educate them, but subjecting them instead to forced begging and physical abuse. A 2007 study done by UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank found that 6,480 talibe were forced to beg in Dakar alone. Women and girls are trafficked for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, including for sex tourism, within Senegal. Transnationally, boys are trafficked to Senegal from The Gambia, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea for forced begging by religious teachers. Senegalese women and girls are trafficked to neighboring countries, the Middle East, and Europe for domestic servitude and possibly for sexual exploitation. Women and girls from other West African countries, particularly Liberia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria may be trafficked to Senegal for sexual exploitation, including for sex tourism.
The Government of Senegal does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Senegal maintained a steady commitment to rescuing and caring for victims, though law enforcement efforts remained modest.
Prosecution.
The Government of Senegal demonstrated modest law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking during the last year. Senegal prohibits all forms of trafficking through its 2005 Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices and to Protect Victims. The law’s prescribed penalties of five to 10 years’ imprisonment for all forms of trafficking are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for rape. In December 2007, nine individuals, two of whom were truck drivers from Guinea-Bissau and one of whom was Senegalese, were arrested at the southern border for attempting to traffic 34 boys. The suspects are in jail awaiting trial. In 2007, a religious leader was prosecuted and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment for beating a talibe to death. The Ministry of Tourism activated a police unit to combat sex tourism in Dakar, though a similar unit established in Mbour is not yet operational. During the year, the Ministry of the Interior activated the Special Commissariat Against Sex Tourism—which it had established in 2005—in Dakar and Mbour. The Ministry of the Interior, through its Bureau of Investigations, works closely with Interpol to monitor immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking. Senegalese police continued to work closely with Bissau-Guinean authorities to repatriate children trafficked for forced begging back to Guinea-Bissau.
Protection.
The Government of Senegal demonstrated solid efforts to protect trafficking victims over the last year. Senegal continued to operate the Ginndi Center, its shelter for destitute children, including trafficking victims. In its record keeping, the Center does not specifically track the number of trafficking victims it receives. However, the Family Ministry, which funds and operates the Center with help from international donors, has recently begun using an NGO-funded computerized database to track trafficking victims. Last year, the center received 917 destitute children, including trafficking victims. With international organization assistance, all of these children were reunited with their families in Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and The Gambia. The government provided 77 of these children with vocational training and 329 with medical care. The government also continued to operate its free child protection hotline out of the Ginndi Center. The hotline received 66,823 calls last year. The government also sometimes refers victims to NGOs for care on an ad hoc basis. The government encourages victims to assist in trafficking investigations or prosecutions by permitting closed-door victim testimonies during trafficking prosecutions and by interviewing victims to gather evidence to prosecute traffickers. The government provides legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Trafficking victims have the option of remaining temporarily or permanently in Senegal under the status of resident or refugee. Victims are not inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked...
Prevention.
The Government of Senegal made minimal efforts to raise awareness about trafficking during the reporting period. As part of its program against the worst forms of child labor, the Family Ministry conducted donor-funded workshops and roundtables in Mbour, Dakar, and other areas of the country to raise awareness about forced child begging, child domestic servitude, and prostitution of children. A magistrate at the High Commissary of Human Rights, the government’s focal point agency to combat trafficking, holds monthly meetings with representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Tourism, Interior, Women, and Education to better disseminate and enforce the law prohibiting trafficking. The government took measures to reduce demand for commercial sex acts in Senegal by activating a tourism police unit and a special police commissariat to combat child sex tourism. The government did not take measures to ensure that its nationals who are deployed abroad as part of peacekeeping missions do not engage in or facilitate trafficking. The Family Ministry is working with a foreign donor to develop a new national action plan against trafficking.

Phat Beach

Phat Beach is a 1996 American comedy film, written and directed by Doug Ellin, which stars Jermaine 'Huggy' Hopkins, Coolio and Brian Hooks.
Plot.
During a glorious Southern California summer, high school student Benny King (Hopkins) is doing time flipping burgers. Benny's father wants him to learn the work ethic, rather than have him sit around the house all summer, dreaming and writing. It's not surprising, then, that when his old friend Durrell (Brian Hooks) comes by with a more attractive alternative, Benny jumps at it. When his family goes on vacation, Benny borrows his father's Mercedes and heads on down to the beach with Durrell. They have told themselves that they are there to sell beach-goers cheap sunglasses, but they are really there to show off their 'phat' box and attract the finest girls with portable beats on the beach.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack album for the film was released on August 7, 1996, through TVT Records and consisted primarily of hip hop and R&B music, with several other genres as well (polka, dubstep). The album reached number 40 on the Top R&B Albums chart.

Song information.
"Lips" was written by Axel-G, who penned "She Said..." for the group's debut album. The music and arrangement was composed by Yukihide "YT" Takiyama whilst Koki Tanaka wrote his own rap verses under his pen name, JOKER. Described by co-lead vocalist Kazuya Kamenashi as the most intense hard rock song the group had ever done, the song speaks of an obsession with a girl's "dyed red lips" and the difficult relationship they share. The lyrics go on to urge the girl not to take on all the blame for the couple's troubles and to not "let go of hand". Though not present in the studio version, Kamenashi usually screams after he sings the introductory verse during live performances. The song is also the theme song for Kamenashi's television drama, "1 Pound no Fukuin", which aired on NTV.
Promotion.
KAT-TUN performed the song on television for the first time on their own variety show "Cartoon KAT-TUN" on January 12, 2008. The group also sung on "Music Station" on February 1 and February 8, 2008, Fuji TV's "Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ" on February 4 and on NTV's "Music Fighter" on February 8.
Chart performance.
In its first week of release, "Lips" made its bow at number one on the Oricon singles chart knocking off Thelma Aoyama's "Soba ni Iru ne" from the top spot with 351,254 copies sold. It is the group's sixth consecutive chart-topper since their debut. The song spent 15 weeks on the chart and has reportedly sold over 421,902 copies to date and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. 
In February 2008, Lips was honored at the 23rd Japan Gold Disc Awards when it placed on the "Best 10 Music Singles (Domestic)" list alongside "Don't U Ever Stop".

John Whitaker (historian)

John Whitaker B.D., F.S.A. (born Manchester 1735; died Ruan Lanihorne 1808), was an English historian and Anglican clergyman. Besides historical studies on the Roman Empire and on the early history of Great Britain he was a reviewer for London magazines and a poet.
Life.
He was the son of James Whitaker, innkeeper, and was born in Manchester on 27 April 1735. In 1771, he published the first volume of "The History of Manchester"; and the second volume in 1775. A copy of Whitaker's manuscript of the continuation to the fifteenth century is in Chetham's Library, Manchester.
Whitaker's views on early British society were idiosyncratic: in his "History of Manchester", (1771–75) he argued that the ancient Britons had already established a feudal system, and under the Romans had been entirely converted to Christianity (his erudition was recognised as remarkable but the theories were mostly illfounded). "The Life of St Neot", published posthumously in 1809, was similarly intended to challenge traditional orthodoxies in the form of the extant saint's lives. 
He took his degrees at Oxford: B.A. 1755; M.A. 1759; and B.D. 1767: he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1771. After taking his degrees and holding two curacies he became Rector of Ruan Lanihorne in Cornwall in 1777 or 1778. He also published a number of sermons, poems, and articles for Richard Polwhele's "History of Cornwall". He was a prolific reviewer for the "English Review", "British Critic", and Anti-Jacobin Review, finding this an important means of supplementing his income and paying for the books necessary for his studies. In addition to his published works he had planned or contemplated a number of other projects: a parochial history of Cornwall, a military history of the Romans in Britain, a history of Oxford, one of London, notes on Shakespeare, and illustrations to the Bible. He was a man of fiery temperament and extreme views, and a fervent belief in all the tenets of ‘orthodox’ Christianity. He was able to inspire considerable friendship and loyalty from those who knew him best. His close friend Richard Polwhele described him as being of a tall, muscular frame, dark featured, and with light greenish eyes. He reputedly had a squint and wore false teeth made of ebony. He died at his rectory on 30 October 1808 and was buried in Ruan Lanihorne in Cornwall; his widow Jane (née Tregenna), who had long suffered ill health, lived on until 30 December 1828.
He studied the decline of the Cornish language and concluded in his work "The Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall"

Human trafficking in Serbia

Serbia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and girls trafficked transnationally and internally for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. Foreign victims are trafficked to Serbia from Macedonia, Ukraine, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Albania, and the People's Republic of China. Serbia is a transit country for victims trafficked from Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia and destined for Italy and other countries. Internal sex trafficking of Serbian women and girls continued to increase as of 2007, comprising more than three-fourths of trafficking cases in 2007. Some children continue to be trafficked into forced labor or forced street begging. According to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and law enforcement, efforts to shut down known brothels continue to prompt traffickers to better conceal victims of trafficking. 
According to the U.S. government, the government of Serbia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking set out by the U.S., though it is making significant efforts to do so. In 2007, the government increased national funding for combating trafficking in persons, actively investigated trafficking, prosecuted high-level cases, and took a step in addressing trafficking-related corruption by investigating and charging a state prosecutor for complicity. During 2007, the government improved its capacity to assist trafficking victims via the establishment of 11 new municipal teams made up of government officials and NGO representatives.
Prosecution.
The Government of Serbia actively investigates trafficking cases, though its court often imposes relatively lenient sentences on convicted trafficking offenders. The criminal code for Serbia criminally prohibits sex and labor trafficking in article 388 and prescribes penalties that are commensurate with those prescribed for other grave offenses, such as rape. In 2007, the government investigated and charged 62 persons with trafficking. The government reported at least 23 trafficking convictions in 2007. Trials often last months or years, and convicted traffickers often delay serving their sentences, sometimes by several years, by filing multiple appeals. This sometimes results in convicted traffickers remaining free and possibly continuing to exploit victims.
Protection.
The government cooperates with NGOs on victim assistance, but does not provide any funding for NGOs providing victims of trafficking with services such as counseling, legal assistance, and reintegration programs. The Agency for the Coordination of Protection of Victims of Trafficking reported the identification of 60 victims in 2007, including 26 minors; 48 of the 60 were Serbian victims. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, according to NGOs in Serbia; 90 percent of victims reportedly participated in the investigation of their traffickers. However, many victims refuse to testify in court, out of fear of reprisals by their traffickers. The government used its 2006 Witness Protection Law to protect only one trafficking victim during the year. According to NGOs, trafficking victims were often directly or indirectly forced to testify against traffickers and some courts continue to demonstrate insensitivity to trafficking victims by scheduling victims and their accused traffickers to appear in court together, despite victims’ objections. 
Serbian law allows victims to file civil suits against traffickers for compensation, but as of March 2008 no trafficking victim had been awarded compensation. Victims pursuing criminal or civil suits are entitled to temporary residence permits and may obtain employment or leave the country pending trial proceedings. The government awarded temporary residence status to a total of six victims in 2007. Identified victims are not detained, jailed, prosecuted, or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. However, one NGO reported that authorities failed to identify some trafficking victims in 2007, resulting in their arrest, detainment, and subsequent deportation. To address this issue, the government expanded its training program for law enforcement. In 2007, thirty-seven trafficking victims were accommodated in two NGO shelters, 21 in a short-term shelter and 16 in transition housing (including two babies). Reintegration services were provided to 47 women and four men (including 22 children). During the reporting period, 11 new municipalities established social assistance teams composed of social workers, police, and NGO staff to provide assistance to potential victims of family violence and trafficking.
Prevention.
The Government of Serbia demonstrated mixed efforts in its prevention activities in 2007. The government has yet to begin implementation of its December 2006 National Strategy to Combat Trafficking in Persons. Furthermore, the government’s anti-trafficking team charged with leading Serbia’s anti-trafficking efforts met only once during the year. However, the government increased its educational prevention programs during the year, and in 2007, launched a fund-raising drive for the Agency for Coordination. It also sponsored a month of anti-trafficking programs on national television during October 2007. Although the government finalized scripts for a project to which it earmarked $100,000 for a 13-episode television series entitled “Modern Slavery,” NGOs expressed concerns about the series being completed. The government did not conduct any awareness campaigns aimed to reduce demand for commercial sex acts. 
Although the government expanded its training program, with the help of U.N. Trafficking expert Dr. Gilly McKenzie, to educate law enforcement how to identify victims, concerns remained about victims sometimes not correctly identified and punished as a result of being trafficked.

<doc id="18629213" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629213" title="Human trafficking in Sierra Leone">
Human trafficking in Sierra Leone

Sierra Leone is a source, transit, and destination country for children and women trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Trafficking within the country is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and the majority of victims are children. Within the country, women and children are trafficked from rural provinces to towns and mining areas for domestic servitude, sexual exploitation, and forced labor in diamond mines, petty trading, petty crime, and for forced begging. Women and children may also be trafficked for forced labor in agriculture and the fishing industry. Transnationally, Sierra Leonean women and children are trafficked to other West African countries, notably Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, and The Gambia for the same purposes listed above and to North Africa, the Middle East, and Western Europe for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation. Sierra Leone is a destination country for children trafficked from Nigeria and possibly from Liberia and Guinea for forced begging, forced labor in mines and as porters, and for sexual exploitation. There have also been cases of children trafficked from refugee communities in Sierra Leone.
The Government of Sierra Leone does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. The government reported that it prosecuted five traffickers, but was unable to provide data on trafficking convictions. While Sierra Leone reported that it referred victims to an international organization’s shelter, the number of victims referred was low.
Prosecution.
The Government of Sierra Leone made modest law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking in the last year. Legislatively, Sierra Leone prohibits all forms of trafficking through its 2005 Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, which prescribes a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment. This penalty is stringent, but not commensurate with penalties for rape, which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Between January and December 2007, the government reported that it conducted 14 trafficking investigations. Five of these cases are being prosecuted—as compared with seven cases prosecuted in 2006. Although an international NGO reported that Sierra Leone convicted three traffickers, the government was unable to corroborate this information. In January 2008, the Sierra Leonean Embassy in Conakry received from the Guinean government four Sierra Leonean women whom Guinean authorities suspected of trafficking children to Sierra Leone, and transported them back to Sierra Leone. Rather than prosecuting them, the government and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) determined that the women were actually trafficking victims and returned them to their communities.
Protection.
The Sierra Leonean government demonstrated limited efforts to protect trafficking victims during the last year. The government does not operate its own shelter, but refers victims to the nation’s only trafficking victim shelter, which is located in Freetown and operated by IOM. The Family Support Units (FSU) of the Sierra Leone Police (SLP) turned over intercepted trafficking victims to the Ministry of Social Welfare (MOSW), which then referred the victims to IOM for assistance. Some victims outside Freetown were not referred for care, however, due to lack of transport to the capital or the difficulty of travel during the rainy season. The government reported that it referred 14 trafficking victims to IOM for assistance in the 2007 calendar year. In January 2007, the Sierra Leonean Embassy in Conakry received from the Guinean government and protected 10 suspected child trafficking victims and returned them to Sierra Leone. The MOSW and IOM determined that the children were in fact not trafficking victims, but were related to the aforementioned four Sierra Leonean women whom Guinean authorities had suspected were trafficking these children into Sierra Leone. The children were reunited with their parents under the supervision of the MOSW.
In March 2008, the government donated shelter space to IOM in order to replace the facility IOM currently rents. Although the government permits victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions, cases take so long to go to court that many victims are no longer available at the time of trial. As a result, some cases are dropped, since many cannot be successfully tried without a victim witness. The government does not actively encourage victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions. Sierra Leone does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. There were no known cases during the year of trafficking victims inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked. However, authorities’ conflation of trafficking and smuggling has probably led to some trafficking victims being penalized as illegal immigrants. Also, NGOs report that police raid brothels and arrest females engaged in prostitution without following procedures to identify trafficking victims among them.
Prevention.
The Government of Sierra Leone made inadequate efforts to raise awareness about trafficking during the reporting period. The government failed to conduct trafficking information or education campaigns. While the National Anti-Trafficking Task Force, which is composed of government officials, NGOs, and international organizations, met monthly for half the year, meetings were less frequent in the year’s second half and government authorities from some key ministries rarely attended. While the 2005 anti-trafficking law mandates the creation of a Trafficking Secretariat to coordinate national anti-trafficking activities, it has yet to be established. Sierra Leone does not monitor immigration and emigration patters for trafficking activity. Border officials continue to lack a full understanding of the distinction between smuggling and trafficking. The government took some measures to reduce demand for commercial sex acts by raiding brothels, but did not follow procedures to identify trafficking victims among females in prostitution. Sierra Leone has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Human trafficking in Singapore

According the US Government's Trafficking in Person's Report, Singapore is a destination country for women and girls trafficked for the purpose of labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Some women from India, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the People’s Republic of China who travel to Singapore voluntarily for prostitution or work are subsequently deceived or coerced into sexual servitude. A significant number of foreign domestic workers in Singapore faces the unlawful confiscation of their travel documents, restrictions on their movement, confinement, and/or physical or sexual abuse. Some Singaporean men travel to countries in the region for child sex tourism. 
Also according the US Government's Trafficking in Person's Report, the Government of Singapore does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. In February, 2008 the government enacted amendments to the Penal Code that criminalize prostitution involving a minor under the age of 18, thereby ensuring that Singaporean law criminalizes all severe forms of trafficking in persons. The police adopted new training programs and procedures to familiarize officers with the new Penal Code offenses and to provide them with the skills to identify potential trafficking victims. Notably, the recent Penal Code amendments also extend extraterritorial jurisdiction over Singaporean citizens and permanent residents who sexually exploit children in other countries, and make organizing or promoting child sex tourism a criminal offense. At the same time, however, the government did not prosecute or convict any trafficking offenders during the reporting period, and did not take adequate measures to protect victims of trafficking, particularly foreign domestic workers subjected to forced labor conditions.

Collin de Plancy was born on November 22, 1853 in Plancy, a small town near Troyes in the Champagne region of eastern France, the son of Jacques Auguste Simon Collin de Plancy, a Jesuit priest and prolific writer on the occult whose name is still much more familiar in France than that of his son. Despite the name, Collin de Plancy was not of noble pedigree. Against the strict laws of lineage Victor’s father had illicitly added the ‘de Plancy’ to his family name of Collin in a move that would later bring accusations against the son.
The young Collin de Plancy was described alternately as laborious, impartial, and instructed, while being lauded as well for his more social qualities – charm, elegance of manners, impeccable taste, and perhaps most importantly, amiability. The introduction to his collected papers in the French Foreign Ministry notes the qualities for which Collin de Plancy seemed best known, “his tact, courtesy, and refined manners” and as one who excelled in “issues of etiquette…but who rarely ventured into the realm of general ideas.” In Seoul he became known for his charming garden parties. Particularly well received were his “chrysanthemum festivals” held every autumn in the gardens of the French legation, during which guest strolled the peaceful grounds in the midst of the budding capital, admiring the park with its greenhouses of flowers. In 1896 de Plancy had constructed an elegant European style compound for the French legation, filling it with antiques from the Chateau de Chenonceaux. He was himself a collector; his respectable assortment of Asian art and ceramics was eventually donated to the Musée Guimet in Paris where it forms a core part of the Korean collection. Victor Collin de Plancy never married.
Collin de Plancy’s diplomatic acumen proved a boon for French interests in Korea during the last decade or so of the 19th century. He became occupied in procuring the concession for of the Seoul-Uiju line for Five-Lilles, personally negotiating with the Korean foreign minister. Along with the above railway concession he also successfully petitioned for mining rights on behalf of French companies along the proposed railroad. However, other efforts spearheaded by Collin de Plancy to gain railway concessions to Mokpo and Wonsan were not so successful. 
Collin de Plancy was successful in raising the French visibility and prestige in other realms more successfully than in railroads and mining. As chief French diplomat in Korea, and enjoying a wide range of contacts, Collin de Plancy was the natural hinge for the expansion of French influence. Collin de Plancy helped a certain Mr. Saltarel establish official contacts in Seoul upon his arrival there as representative of several French companies in early 1898. Saltarel eventually gained a mining concession in Korea. In late 1899 a French military attaché in China, Commander Polyeucte Vidal, was also brought in through Collin de Plancy’s efforts to assess the state of the Korean arsenal and make recommendations as to its improvement and the establishment of a Korean arms industry. Eventually the French, represented by Vidal, would join with the Russians in a mutual campaign to reorganize the Korean arsenal. Collin de Plancy also brought in an expert from the Sevrès Ceramic Works to recommend ways of modernizing and expanding the Korean porcelain industry. But France’s most visible representative, behind Collin de Plancy himself, was undoubtedly E. Clemencet, who had been brought to Korea in 1898, shortly after Korea’s entrance into the International Postal Union, to organize a modern Korean postal service. Upon the bureau’s opening in January 1900 Clemencet sent the first international letter to Collin de Plancy (then on leave in France), as the “only fitting homage” to the man who had contributed so much to making the service a reality. The French consul also proved instrumental in paving the way for Korea's participation at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900. 
In 1906, shortly after Korea became a protectorship of Japan, Collin de Plancy left Korea for a posting in Bangkok, Thailand. He went into retirement the following year. After his death in 1924 a large part of his art and book collection made its way into the possession of the Musée Guimet, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, and the Collège de France.
Collin de Plancy was also an amateur naturalist and authored several texts on the insects and reptiles of his native France.

Human trafficking in Slovakia

Slovak Republic is a source, transit, and limited destination country for women and girls from Moldova, Ukraine, Bulgaria, the Balkans, the Baltics, and China trafficked to Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Spain, Croatia, and Slovenia for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. Men from Vietnam were trafficked to Slovakia for the purpose of forced labor. Roma women and girls from Slovakia are trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. The Government of the Slovak Republic does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government allocated $91,000 for anti-trafficking efforts in 2007, an increase from $60,000 in 2006. In February 2008, police began investigating the country’s first identified labor trafficking case involving eight Vietnamese nationals forced to work in a cigarette factory in Bratislava. The government also made efforts to improve victim identification and assistance referral. However, the number of victims assisted by government- funded programs decreased in 2007.
Prosecution.
The Government of the Slovak Republic demonstrated adequate law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. The Slovak Republic prohibits all forms of trafficking through Sections 179-181 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties under the criminal code ranging from four to 25 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Police conducted 14 trafficking investigations in 2007, including one labor trafficking investigation, compared to 20 investigations in 2006. The government prosecuted 16 defendants in four cases, compared to 32 trafficking cases in 2006. Seven trafficking offenders were convicted during the reporting period, down from 18 convicted in 2006. Most convicted traffickers were given sentences of up to two years’ imprisonment; one trafficker was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment. There were no official cases of high-level government officials involved in trafficking during the reporting period. The government extradited one person to Austria to face trafficking charges during the reporting period.
Protection.
The government demonstrated modest efforts to assist and protect victims in 2007. The Ministry of the Interior funded a new NGO program which provided shelter and assistance to four victims. In 2006, government funding to NGOs aided 10 victims; an additional 43 victims were assisted by nongovernmental-funded programs. The Ministry of Interior published a training manual and provided victim identification, referral, and sensitivity training for 490 police officers. Police identified and referred 15 victims to NGOs for assistance during the reporting period. Victims are encouraged to participate in investigations and prosecutions; foreign victims who cooperate with law enforcement are permitted to remain in Slovakia and work for the duration of the investigation or trial.
Prevention.
Slovakia demonstrated limited efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period. The Border and Alien Police monitored the border for evidence of trafficking. The government continued to operate a 38-bed shelter for unaccompanied minors who enter the country illegally, thus helping to prevent the trafficking of this vulnerable population. In 2007, the government allocated $22,000 to develop and implement future awareness campaigns to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The Ministry of Education approved the use of NGO-produced anti-trafficking materials in schools in 2007, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs cooperated with NGOs in a series of training and trafficking awareness activities aimed at vulnerable population groups, including Roma populations. During the reporting period, the government published a brochure educating its nationals traveling to other EU countries for employment opportunities about the dangers of trafficking. Slovakia did not provide trafficking awareness training for deployed peacekeeping officials during the reporting period.

Human trafficking in Slovenia

Slovenia is a transit, destination, and to a lesser extent a source country for men, women, and children trafficked from Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Turkey, Albania, and Montenegro for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor, including in the construction industry. In 2007, disabled men from Slovakia were trafficked to Slovenia for the purpose of forced begging. Slovenian women are trafficked within the country or to other European countries for commercial sexual exploitation. The Government of Slovenia fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The government sustained its strong law enforcement efforts and generous victim assistance funding during the reporting period. In 2007, Slovenia increased funding for victim assistance from $85,000 to $105,000. The government also increased and diversified its public awareness efforts.
Prosecution.
The government demonstrated adequate law enforcement efforts in 2007. The government prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through Article 387(a) of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties ranging from six months to 10 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Authorities conducted six trafficking investigations in 2007, up from three in 2006. Courts prosecuted three cases and convicted five traffickers in 2007, down from six cases prosecuted and seven traffickers convicted in 2006. Four traffickers were given sentences ranging from 15 to 57 months’ imprisonment and one convicted trafficker served no time in prison. The Slovenian Police Directorate provided eight training sessions for 165 police officers during the reporting period.
Protection.
The Government of Slovenia provided quality victim assistance and protection during the reporting period, although the number of victims assisted and referred by government officials declined in 2007. The government provided $105,000 to two NGOs to provide both short-term and extended victim assistance including shelter, rehabilitative counseling, medical assistance, vocational training, and legal assistance. In 2007, these NGOs assisted 26 victims or potential victims compared to 43 victims assisted in 2006. The government continued to implement its formalized victim identification and referral mechanism during the reporting period; however, during the year, police referred only four victims to NGOs for assistance, down from 21 victims referred in 2006. After identification, victims were granted a 90-day reflection period, and were encouraged to participate in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; foreign victims who assist law enforcement are eligible to stay in Slovenia for the duration of the trial. Eight victims assisted law enforcement officials with trafficking investigations and prosecutions in 2007. Victims were not punished for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.
Prevention.
The government increased its prevention efforts during the reporting period. Slovenia continued to fund an NGO to provide trafficking awareness classes for students in elementary and secondary schools, reaching 400 students, parents, and teachers nationwide in 2007. With government funding, one NGO conducted a radio campaign simulating a trafficking victim’s call to the NGO’s hotline to encourage victims to seek assistance. In September 2007, the Ministry of Education introduced the theme of human trafficking into the standard Slovenian primary school curriculum. Slovenia continued to monitor its borders for evidence of trafficking. The government continued to provide Slovenian troops assigned to peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and Afghanistan with trafficking awareness training. The government has not taken any measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.

On Spirals

On Spirals is a treatise by Archimedes in 225 BC. Although Archimedes did not discover the Archimedean spiral, he employed it in this book to square the circle and trisect an angle.
Contents.
Preface.
Archimedes begins "On Spirals" with a message to Dositheus of Pelusium mentioning the death of Conon as a loss to mathematics. He then goes on to summarize the results of "On the Sphere and Cylinder" and "On Conoids and Spheroids". He continues to state his results of "On Spirals".
Archimedean spiral.
The Archimedean spiral was first studied by Conon and was later studied by Archimedes in "On Spirals". Archimedes was able to find various tangents to the spiral. He defines the spiral as:
Trisecting an angle.
The construction as to how Archimedes trisected the angle is as follows:
Suppose the angle ABC is to be trisected. Trisect the segment BC and find BD to be one third of BC. Draw a circle with center B and radius BD. Suppose the circle with center B intersects the spiral at point E. Angle ABE is one third angle ABC.
Squaring the circle.
To square the circle, Archimedes gave the following construction:
Let P be the point on the spiral when it has completed one turn. Let the tangent at P cut the line perpendicular to OP at T. OT is the length of the circumference of the circle with radius OP.
Archimedes had already proved as the first proposition of "Measurement of a Circle" that the area of a circle is equal to a right-angled triangle having the legs' lengths equal to the radius of the circle and the circumference of the circle. So the area of the circle with radius OP is equal to the area of the triangle OPT.

<doc id="18629246" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629246" title="Human trafficking in South Africa">
Human trafficking in South Africa

South Africa is a source, transit, and destination country for trafficked guys, women, and children. South African girls are trafficked within their country for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic servitude, while boys are trafficked internally for use in street vending, food service, and agriculture. Anecdotal evidence suggests that South African children are forced to provide unpaid labor for landowners in return for their family occupying land or accommodation, or maintaining labor tenancy rights. Child sex tourism is prevalent in a number of South Africa’s cities. Women and girls from other African countries are trafficked to South Africa for commercial sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, and other jobs in the service sector; occasionally, these women are trafficked onward to Europe for sexual exploitation. Thai, Chinese, and European women are trafficked to South Africa for debt-bonded commercial sexual exploitation. Young men and boys from Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi are trafficked to South Africa for farm work, often laboring for months in South Africa without pay before "employers" have them arrested and deported as illegal immigrants. Organized criminal groups—including Nigerian, Chinese, and Eastern European syndicates, local gangs and individual policemen facilitate trafficking into and within South Africa, particularly for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.
The Government of South Africa does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; making no significant efforts to do so. South Africa is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for a fourth consecutive year for its failure to show increasing efforts to address trafficking over the last year. The government provided inadequate data on trafficking crimes investigated or prosecuted or on resulting convictions or sentences. In addition, it did not provide information on its efforts to protect victims of trafficking and continued to deport and/or prosecute suspected foreign victims without providing appropriate protective services.
Prosecution.
The South African government did not provide information on anti-trafficking investigations that resulted in the punishment of any traffickers in 2007. For the majority of the reporting period, South Africa did not have laws that specifically prohibited trafficking in persons, though a variety of other criminal statutes, such as the Prevention of Organized Crime Act, were used to prosecute trafficking crimes. Law enforcement authorities could also use existing laws prohibiting involuntary servitude, child labor, and forced labor to prosecute labor trafficking cases, but do not appear to have done so. The lack of specific anti-trafficking statutes and explicit penalties for trafficking crimes continued to hamper South African law enforcement efforts in 2007, as many working level police, labor, and social welfare officials possessed little understanding of the crime or did not view it as part of their responsibilities. However, in December 2007, several sections of the Sexual Offenses Amendment Act came into force, including Chapter 7 Part 6 which contains broad provisions against sex trafficking, but makes no provision for victim protection. Implementing regulations for the children's Act of 2005 remained unfinished, preventing use of the law’s provisions on child trafficking. The comment period on a draft comprehensive human trafficking bill closed in June 2007 and the South African Law Reform Commission (SALRC) staff finalized the text to be recommended to the Department of Justice in early 2008.
Although the government initiated a number of significant investigations during the reporting period, it made little progress in prosecuting or convicting suspected traffickers. In November 2007, new racketeering charges were filed against the suspected trafficker in a December 2006 sex trafficking case involving Thai women. Four cooperating Thai witnesses remain in protective custody and are expected to testify when the case comes to trial in May 2008. In July 2007, ten Thai women were arrested, along with their two Indian and Thai traffickers, at a brothel in Durban. Three women agreed to testify for the state and remain under government protection; seven women and their alleged traffickers await prosecution. After receiving a tip from Zimbabwean police in June 2007, the South African Police Service (SAPS) arrested a South African man for allegedly trafficking a Zimbabwean woman to South Africa with promises of a job. While he was initially taken into custody under charges of violating migration laws and the Sexual Offenses Act, the status of this case is unknown. Because some parents had given consent for the initial travel, the Cape Town magistrate’s court dismissed, in December 2007, charges against a man accused of trafficking boys to the city for street vending and detaining them against their will without pay. In March 2008, the SAPS arrested 27 prostituted Chinese women, as well as the seven men accused of transporting them to South Africa and selling them into the sex trade; a police spokesman indicated that the women entered the country illegally and would be deported.
The status of the Department of Labor’s investigations, if any, into cases involving child labor trafficking is unknown; also unknown are any prosecutions of child labor trafficking. In early 2007, Labor Department officials conducted a week of surprise visits to homes employing adult domestic workers to inspect working conditions; the results of these inspections are unknown. The government did not provide information on the status of pending cases reported in 2006. The South African Police Service has a Human Trafficking Desk within its Organized Crime Unit; the government did not provide information related to actions or investigations taken by the Desk during the reporting period. The government did not document or track anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts or provide specialized anti-trafficking training to law enforcement, prosecutors, or judicial personnel. During 2007, there was little cross-border cooperation on human trafficking between the government and its neighbors. Some local law enforcement officials are believed to be connected with organized criminal elements that engage in human trafficking.
Protection.
Government protection for trafficking victims during the reporting period remained inadequate, and formal protocols to identify and care for trafficking victims were lacking. Police referred an unknown number of internal child trafficking victims to local NGO-run shelters during the reporting period. As part of its ongoing program to assist organizations that shelter vulnerable populations, the government granted funding to some facilities that provided housing for trafficking victims, though not in a consistent or timely fashion. In 2007, the Department of Home Affairs referred one foreign child victim of trafficking to IOM for assistance. The Department of Social Development (DSD) provided the victim with shelter accommodation, schooling, and basic needs. However, DSD did not refer any children to IOM for assistance during the reporting period. It is unknown whether law enforcement or social service officials referred foreign victims directly to other organizations in 2007.
Organizations working to help trafficked children continued to lament South Africa’s shortage of social workers, a situation resulting in inadequate case monitoring and follow-up, and failure in some cases to accompany children to court. The government actively encouraged victims’ assistance in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers; South Africa’s witness protection program safeguarded at least seven Thai trafficking victims during the year to enable their involvement. The government provided these witnesses shelter and modest food stipends. Despite this positive development, the government continued to arrest and, at times, prosecute suspected trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked, as noted in the aforementioned case of the 27 Chinese women. In addition, extensive delays in scheduling court appearances have resulted in some alleged victims choosing not to testify during the trial of their traffickers. However, the new Sexual Offenses Act states that sex trafficking victims are not liable to stand trial for any criminal offense, including any migration-related offense, which was committed as a direct result of being trafficked. No similar provision exists for victims of labor trafficking. The lack of national coordination and procedures for victim protection continued to lead to deportation of most foreign victims before they were provided protective services or were able to give evidence in court. Immigration officials did not attempt to identify trafficking victims among the thousands of undocumented foreigners they detained—notably Zimbabweans and Mozambicans—before deporting them.
Prevention.
The government demonstrated minimal progress in combating human trafficking through prevention efforts. It conducted no anti-trafficking information or education campaigns during the reporting period. The Sexual Offenses and Community Affairs Unit of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA/SOCA) serves as the de facto lead of the government’s anti-trafficking effort and chairs the Trafficking in Persons Inter-sectoral Task Team made up of government departments, IOM, UNODC, and a local NGO. The Task Team produced no significant outcomes in 2007. In January 2008, NPA/SOCA established an internal Human Trafficking Unit consisting of a national trafficking coordinator and a program manager. This Unit is tasked with reviving the Inter-sectoral Task Team and undertaking data gathering and public awareness raising activities, as outlined in the government’s 2006 anti-trafficking plan of action. NPA/SOCA launched a website in December 2007 outlining its proposed strategy for responding to human trafficking. The website also provides the public with information on the nature of human trafficking and instructions for reporting a case or obtaining victim assistance.
The government made no progress in investigating the cross-border trafficking of Mozambican, Malawian, and Zimbabwean children for agricultural labor. In January 2008, however, the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Zimbabwean government to conduct a joint project to regularize the status of illegal Zimbabwean migrant farm workers in South Africa’s Limpopo Province and ensure them proper employment conditions. The government did not undertake efforts to reduce domestic demand for commercial sex acts or to combat child sex tourism during the reporting period. All South African troops destined for peacekeeping missions abroad are provided training on sexual exploitation issues prior to their deployment.

Pericine

Pericine is one of a number of indole alkaloids found in the tree "Picralima nitida", commonly known as Akuamma. The dried seeds from this plant are used in traditional medicine throughout West Africa, particularly in Ghana as well as in the Ivory Coast and Nigeria. As with some other alkaloids from this plant such as akuammine, pericine has been shown to bind to mu opioid receptors, and has an IC50 of 0.6 μmol, around 6x more potent than codeine when tested in the same assay. However it may also have convulsant effects.

<doc id="18629257" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629257" title="Human trafficking in Spain">
Human trafficking in Spain

Spain is a transit and destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. While most victims are women between the ages of 18 and 24 trafficked for sexual exploitation, females as young as 16 are also trafficked to Spain for the same purpose, and men are trafficked for forced labor, usually in agriculture. Primary source countries for victims trafficked to Spain are Romania, Russia, Brazil, Colombia and Nigeria, although victims are also trafficked from other areas of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa. In smaller numbers, Chinese victims are trafficked to Spain primarily for labor exploitation.
The Government of Spain fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Spain undertook sustained measures to assist trafficking victims, prosecute traffickers, provide anti-trafficking law enforcement statistics, prevent trafficking, and reduce the demand for commercial sex.
Prosecution.
The Government of Spain demonstrated strong efforts to combat child trafficking through law enforcement in the last year. Spain prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons through Article 318 of its Criminal and Penal Code. The prescribed penalties for sex trafficking is five to 15 years’ imprisonment, and the penalty for labor trafficking is four to 12 years in prison. These are sufficiently stringent, and the penalties prescribed for sex trafficking are commensurate with the prescribed penalties for rape. The government implemented new legislation in 2007 that increased prescribed penalties for trafficking by two to six years in prison if the offender is found to be part of a criminal organization, and passed additional legislation in 2007 that allows Spanish courts to prosecute cases of trafficking that have occurred outside Spain’s borders.
During the reporting period, police arrested 530 individuals for sex trafficking and 161 for labor trafficking. Government officials prosecuted 102 trafficking cases, convicted 142 trafficking offenders, and imposed an average prison sentence of 4.6 years on those convicted. Over 67 percent of these sentences were greater than four years, and approximately 25 percent of the convictions resulted in a fine and/ or suspended sentence. Spain announced in early 2008 that it would allot $8.6 million to fund an anti-trafficking cooperation agreement with several Central American countries.
Protection.
The government sustained impressive efforts to provide care for trafficking victims during the reporting period. In 2007, Spain increased funding to anti-trafficking NGOs providing care to victims. Spain does not have a formal mechanism for referring victims to service providers; however, Spanish police continued informally to refer rescued victims to NGOs providing temporary shelter and rehabilitation services. Victims receive medical assistance, including emergency care, through the national health care system. The police identified 1,035 sex trafficking victims and 445 labor trafficking victims in 2007. The government encourages foreign victims to assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions by providing work and residence permits to victims choosing to assist, giving them the option of either permanent residence status or funding to return to their own countries after the prosecution. There is no indication that victims are inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Spain does not employ formal procedures for identifying victims among vulnerable groups, such as women in prostitution.
Prevention.
Spain sustained efforts to raise awareness about trafficking over the past year. The Spanish government instituted a toll-free hotline that offers trafficking victims and potential victims information. Regional offices of the national police conduct quarterly reviews to set goals for combating trafficking and to assess progress. Spain has not yet, however, enacted its National Integral Plan Against Trafficking in Persons which was expected to be finalized in 2007. The plan includes a government pledge of almost $45 million per year and the dedication of over 200 new police and civil guards to its enforcement. Local governments continued demand-reduction campaigns. The city of Madrid targeted potential sex solicitors with the slogan, “Do not contribute to the perpetuation of 21st Century Slavery.” Spanish military troops deploying abroad as international peacekeepers received anti-trafficking training through participation in multilateral training efforts. Under the motto “There Are No Excuses,” the Spanish government warned travelers against child sex tourism. In January 2008, the Ministries of Labor and Social Affairs and Foreign Affairs teamed up with Save the Children to host an international conference on child trafficking, which addressed child sex tourism.

<doc id="18629258" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629258" title="Main Core">
Main Core

Main Core is the code name of a database maintained since the 1980s by the federal government of the United States. Main Core contains personal and financial data of millions of U.S. citizens believed to be threats to national security. The data, which comes from the NSA, FBI, CIA, and other sources, is collected and stored without warrants or court orders. The database's name derives from the fact that it contains "copies of the 'main core' or essence of each item of intelligence information on Americans produced by the FBI and the other agencies of the U.S. intelligence community."
The Main Core database is believed to have originated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1982, following Ronald Reagan's Continuity of Operations plan outlined in the National Security Directive (NSD) 69 / National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 55, entitled "Enduring National Leadership," implemented on September 14, 1982.
As of 2008 there were reportedly eight million Americans listed in the database as possible threats, often for trivial reasons, whom the government may choose to track, question, or detain in a time of crisis.
The existence of the database was first reported on in May 2008 by Christopher Ketcham and in July 2008 by Tim Shorrock.

<doc id="18629272" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629272" title="Human trafficking in Sri Lanka">
Human trafficking in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is a source and destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. Sri Lankan men and women migrate willingly to Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and South Korea to work as construction workers, domestic servants, or garment factory workers. However, some find themselves in situations of involuntary servitude when faced with restrictions on movement, withholding of passports, threats, physical or sexual abuse, and debt bondage that is, in some instances, facilitated by large pre-departure fees imposed by recruitment agents. Children are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and, less frequently, for forced labor. The designated Foreign Terrorist Organization Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) continued to recruit, sometimes forcibly, children for use as soldiers in areas outside of the Sri Lankan government’s control. Government security forces may also be complicit in letting a pro-government paramilitary organization recruit, sometimes forcibly, child soldiers. Reports also indicate that a small number of women from Thailand, China, Russia, and other countries of the Newly Independent States are trafficked into Sri Lanka for commercial sexual exploitation. In November 2007, over 100 Sri Lankan peacekeeping soldiers were repatriated based on accusations that they engaged in sexual misconduct, some cases involving minors, in Haiti. The Government of Sri Lanka does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Sri Lanka is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for failing to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons over the previous year, particularly in the area of law enforcement. 
The government failed to arrest, prosecute, or convict any person for trafficking offenses and continued to punish some victims of trafficking for crimes committed as a result of being trafficked. At the same time, Sri Lanka protected some victims of trafficking, including Sri Lankan nationals trafficked abroad. The government appointed a focal point on trafficking in persons in July, who convenes a monthly anti-trafficking working group to develop and coordinate anti-trafficking policy. ("This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.")
Prosecution.
Sri Lanka made little progress on its law enforcement efforts this reporting period. The Sri Lankan government prohibits all forms of trafficking through an April 2006 amendment to its penal code. Trafficking offenses are punishable by up to 20 years’ imprisonment; these penalties are commensurate with those assigned for other grave crimes. While the government took administrative action against 350 labor recruiters engaging in fraudulent recruitment practices, it did not criminally prosecute, convict, or sentence recruiters for practices that amounted to trafficking. The government initiated one investigation of a recruitment agent involved in a case where three females were to be trafficked to Saudi Arabia as domestic servants. Sri Lanka similarly failed to report any prosecutions or convictions for trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation, including trafficking of children. Sri Lanka, in cooperation with the United Nations, launched an investigation into allegations of the complicity in sexual misconduct of Sri Lankan peacekeepers in Haiti, including sexual exploitation of minors. The government investigated 47 cases of child abduction for forced labor as child soldiers, resulting in 37 being returned home. No arrests, prosecutions, or convictions were made in relation to these cases, however. There were no public officials arrested for facilitating trafficking, nor were there substantiated reports that any officials were involved in trafficking.
Protection.
The Sri Lankan government’s efforts to provide protection for trafficking victims improved nominally, but remained limited. The government did not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they would suffer retribution or hardship. Sri Lanka also failed to ensure that victims of trafficking were not punished for acts committed as a result of being trafficked. Of particular concern are ongoing reports that women arrested on suspicion of being trafficked into Sri Lanka for the purpose of sexual exploitation were asked to pay fines in exchange for release from prison and were usually deported thereafter. Law enforcement officers continue to lack a formal system to identify potential victims of trafficking. The government does not provide specialized training for victim identification, though law enforcement officers participated in NGO-provided training.
For Sri Lankan victims, the government relies primarily on NGOs to provide victim protection services due to resource constraints. Police encourage these victims to assist in investigations against their traffickers, but do not undertake any specific measures to ensure victim or witness safety. For Sri Lankan victims trafficked overseas, the government operates shelters in diplomatic missions, offers repatriation assistance, and provides compensation to some who have registered with the government before leaving. In early 2008, the government paid for the repatriation of over 200 Sri Lankan domestic workers from safe houses in the Middle East. For repatriated Sri Lankan victims, however, there is little government effort to investigate the crimes committed against them. Limited aid is offered in terms of shelter, counseling, and medical care upon return. The government opened two temporary shelters for women who are victims of violence, and these were made available to trafficking victims. The government established an inter-ministerial committee to address the issue of child soldiers. Sri Lanka provides two rehabilitation centers specifically for children conscripted as soldiers; since their establishment in 2005, the rehabilitation centers have assisted 52 children.
Prevention.
Sri Lanka made modest efforts to prevent trafficking in persons during the reporting period. In August 2007, the Bureau of Foreign Employment (BFE) began requiring that all overseas employment contracts be signed in the presence a BFE official to ensure that migrant workers understand the contracts’ terms. The government conducted 26 awareness campaigns on child sexual exploitation among teachers, students, hotel staff, taxi and rikshaw drivers, and others employed in the tourism industry. In February 2008, the government established a hotline for complaints about child labor, sexual exploitation, and other abuses. Sri Lanka has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

Human trafficking in Sudan

Sudan is a source country for men, women, and children trafficked internally for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation. Sudan is also a transit and destination country for Ethiopian women trafficked abroad for domestic servitude. Sudanese women and girls are trafficked within the country, as well as possibly to Middle Eastern countries such as Qatar, for domestic servitude.
In 2007, Greek law enforcement authorities identified a female sex trafficking victim from Sudan. The terrorist rebel organization, Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), continues to harbor small numbers of Sudanese and Ugandan children in the southern part of the country for use as cooks, porters, and combatants; some of these children are also trafficked across borders into Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In March 2007, six Sudanese girls were abducted by the LRA near Maridi, Western Equatoria. Sudanese children are unlawfully conscripted, at times through abduction, and utilized by armed rebel groups—including all SLA factions, the Popular Defense Forces, Janjaweed militia, and Chadian opposition forces—in Sudan’s ongoing conflict in Darfur; the Sudanese Armed Forces and associated militias also continue to exploit young children in this region.
There were confirmed reports of unlawful child recruitment in mid-2007 by the JEM/Peace Wing among communities of internally displaced persons in Dereig, South Darfur. Militia groups in Darfur, some of which are linked to the government, abduct women for short periods of forced labor and to perpetrate sexual violence.
Forcible recruitment of adults and particularly children by virtually all armed groups involved in Sudan’s concluded north-south civil war was commonplace; thousands of children still associated with these forces await demobilization and reintegration into their communities of origin.
In addition to the exploitation of children by armed groups during the two decades-long north-south civil war, thousands of Dinka women and children were abducted and subsequently enslaved by members of the Missiriya and Rezeigat tribes during this time. An unknown number of children from the Nuba tribe were similarly abducted and enslaved.
A portion of those who were abducted and enslaved remained with their abductors in South Darfur and West Kordofan and experienced varying types of treatment; others were sold or given to third parties, including in other regions of the country; and some ultimately escaped from their captors. While there have been no known new abductions of Dinka by members of Baggara tribes in the last few years, inter-tribal abductions continue in southern Sudan, especially in Jonglei and Eastern Equatoria states.
The Government of National Unity of Sudan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. While the government did take limited steps to demobilize child soldiers, combating human trafficking through law enforcement or prevention measures was not a priority for the government in 2007.
Prosecution.
The government’s anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts were negligible during the reporting period; it did not investigate or prosecute any suspected trafficking cases. Sudan is a large country with porous borders and destitute hinterlands; the national government has little ability to establish authority or a law enforcement presence in many regions. Sudan’s criminal code does not prohibit all forms of trafficking in persons, though its Articles 162, 163, and 164, criminalize abduction, luring, and forced labor, respectively.
The Interim National Constitution prohibits slavery and forced labor. No trafficker has ever been prosecuted under these articles. In 2007, the Council of Ministers approved the Child Protection Act, which prohibits the recruitment or enlistment of soldiers under the age of 18; the act must be approved by the parliament before it can be implemented.
The draft Sudan Armed Forces Act, which was expected to be debated in the National Assembly in October 2006, was returned to the Council of Ministers for review. The bill prescribes criminal penalties for persons who recruit children under 18 years of age, as well as for a range of human rights violations, including abduction and enslavement.
In June 2007, Southern Sudan’s Child Protection Act of 2006, which prohibits the recruitment of children, passed its first reading in the Southern Sudan Assembly and is now in its second reading. The government does not document or track anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts; nor does it provide specialized anti-trafficking training to law enforcement, prosecutorial, and judicial personnel.
Protection.
Sudan’s Government of National Unity (GNU) made only minimal efforts to protect victims of trafficking and focused primarily on the demobilization of child soldiers during the last year. The government continued to have funding and capacity gaps in its own entities involved in combating trafficking, and the GNU continued to demonstrate extremely low levels of cooperation with humanitarian workers in the Darfur region on a broad spectrum of issues, including human trafficking.
In 2006, the GNU and the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) passed legislation formally establishing the National Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) Commission, and its Northern and Southern components—the Northern Sudan DDR Commission (NSDDRC), and the Southern Sudan DDR Commission (SSDDRC), respectively. During the period, disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration commissions were established in the northern cities of Nyala, Geneina, and El Fasher, and provided with staff.
However, while the training of staff in child protection and the demobilization and reintegration of children began, the work of these commissions cannot commence in the absence of a clear agreement between the GNU and armed groups as to how to proceed. In 2007, the NSDDRC demobilized 283 children serving with the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) in South Kordofan.
The NSDDRC also facilitated cross-border return to Bentiu of child soldiers demobilized from the SPLA. The staff of the SSDDRC grew to 225 people in 2007 and representatives were posted to all southern states.
In contrast to the previous reporting period, SSDDRC staff received salaries and training on child protection, demobilization, reintegration, and family tracing. The SSDDRC, with the coordination of and assistance from UNICEF, demobilized approximately 1,000 child soldiers, including girls, between 2006 and 2007, with 1,500 remaining, including 227 at an SPLA camp in Southern Blue Nile.
The SSDDRC continued to register child soldiers throughout the year and coordinated with the NSDDRC to trace and reunify them with their families. The Committee for the Eradication of Abduction of Women and Children (CEAWC), established in 1999 to facilitate the safe return of abducted women and children to their families, was not operational during the majority of the reporting period.
Before March 2008, its most recent retrieval and transport missions took place in January–February 2006; since that time, neither the GNU nor the GoSS provided CEAWC with the necessary funding for the transport and reunification of previously identified abductees with their families.
However, in early March 2008, the GoSS provided CEAWC with $1 million to resume its program; soon after, CEAWC negotiated the release of 95 individuals in the Nyala region and 71 individuals in the Ed Daein region of South Darfur from their abductors, and transported them to transit centers.
However, the return process was fraught with serious protection concerns. Reports indicate that CEAWC’s community workers regularly denied social workers from the State Ministries of Social Welfare access to those arriving at the transit centers, and prevented United Nations (UN) staff from interviewing new arrivals, visiting the transit centers, and viewing convoy departure manifests.
CEAWC arranged convoys to transport released abductees to the south, but failed to provide access to sufficient food and water. In addition, CEAWC made no preparation to provide for the basic needs or shelter of the former abductees after their arrival in southern Sudan; lacks a mechanism to conduct family tracing or reintegrate abductees into their former communities; and does not follow up with the abductees after their return to assess their well being or the success of their integration.
In April 2007, the Governments of Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish claims facilities to compensate Sudanese children who worked as camel jockeys in the U.A.E. for their injuries. In June 2007, three child camel jockeys were repatriated from the U.A.E and received by their extended families.
In January 2007, the Khartoum State Police established a child and family protection unit with the support of UNICEF. The unit, which offers various services such as legal aid and psychosocial support, assisted more than 400 child victims of abuse and sexual violence and could potentially provide these services to trafficking victims. Similar units are slated to open in Western Darfur, Ghedaref, and Kassala States.
Prevention.
The government made limited efforts to prevent future incidences of trafficking during the reporting period. The National Council on Child Welfare collaborated with UNICEF to launch a comprehensive child protection awareness campaign in North Kordofan as part of the celebration of the June 2007 Day of the African Child.
Aiming to create a greater community response to grave child rights violations, the campaign was also launched in Darfur, Eastern Sudan, Khartoum, and the three areas, and consists of messages on a number of child protection issues, including unlawful child recruitment and sexual and gender-based violence. Sudan has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

<doc id="18629286" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629286" title="Human trafficking in Suriname">
Human trafficking in Suriname

Suriname is principally a destination and transit country for men, women, and children trafficked transnationally for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. It is also a source country for underage Surinamese girls, and increasingly boys, trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. Some of these children are trafficked into the sex trade surrounding gold mining camps in the country’s interior. Foreign girls and women from Guyana, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia are trafficked into Suriname for commercial sexual exploitation; some transit Suriname en route to Europe. Chinese men are subjected to possible debt bondage in Suriname, and are subject to forced labor in supermarkets and the construction sector. Chinese women reportedly are exploited sexually in massage parlors and brothels. Haitian migrants, typically en route to French Guiana, sometimes are forced to work in Surinamese agriculture. The Government of Suriname does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government sustained a moderate level of law enforcement action against trafficking crimes, and modestly improved victim assistance and prevention efforts. However, official complicity with suspected trafficking activity is an area for concern.
Prosecution.
The Surinamese government sustained moderate anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts over the last year. Suriname prohibits all forms of human trafficking through its criminal code, prescribing punishment from five to 20 years’ imprisonment. These punishments are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. An interagency anti-trafficking in persons working group leads government efforts to investigate and prosecute traffickers. During the reporting period, the government convicted a defendant charged with trafficking Brazilian women into prostitution, and sentenced him to 2.5 years in prison. A trial against four brothel owners charged with trafficking women from the Dominican Republic for sexual exploitation continued. In February 2008, police arrested two brothel owners for trafficking Brazilian women into the country; these cases are pending. An anti-trafficking police unit randomly checked brothels for children as well as adults in forced or coerced conditions. Police cooperated with authorities in Guyana and the Dominican Republic on transnational trafficking cases, and sought improved cooperation with Colombia, the Netherlands Antilles, and French Guiana. There were reports that some Surinamese immigration and customs officials facilitated trafficking into the country by accepting bribes. No prosecutions of such trafficking complicity have been initiated, although investigations of these allegations continue.
Protection.
The government made modest improvements to protect victims of trafficking during the year. Police and prosecutors relied chiefly on civil society partners, particularly a recently established NGO, the Trafficking-in-Persons Foundation, to shelter and assist victims. The government assisted these NGOs with finding safe houses to shelter victims, and worked closely with consular representatives from other countries on repatriation efforts. The government also extended services provided to domestic violence victims to trafficking victims, and widely distributed among key personnel an operations manual on how to identify and treat trafficking victims. Surinamese authorities encourage victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. There were reports that some foreign victims were incarcerated and deported for immigration violations. Suriname does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. The government’s anti-trafficking in persons working group is finalizing draft legislation to provide trafficking victims with temporary residency status. Suriname continued discussions with governments in neighboring Guyana, French Guiana, and Brazil on modalities for repatriating trafficking victims.
Prevention.
The government improved prevention efforts during the reporting period. Senior officials continued to condemn and draw public attention to the problem of human trafficking in Suriname. The government’s anti-trafficking in persons working group worked with the International Organization for Migration to implement awareness-raising campaigns across the country, reaching approximately 40,000 people. Outreach activities also were directed to the nation’s border area with Guyana, where many trafficking victims enter the country. Military police, who man ports of entry in this area, were trained on identifying potential trafficking victims. The anti-trafficking in persons working group also issued widespread media warnings about potential trafficking activity after suspicious advertisements were placed in local newspapers recruiting young people to work abroad. However, no discernible government campaigns to reduce demand for commercial sex acts took place during the reporting period. Suriname has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.

European Women's Lobby

The European Women’s Lobby (EWL) is an NGO founded in 1990 and the largest umbrella organisation of women’s associations in the European Union (EU), working to promote women’s rights and equality between women and men. As of November 2009, EWL membership extends to organisations in all 27 EU member states and the three candidate countries, as well as to 21 European-wide bodies, representing a total of more than 2500 organisations.
With a Secretariat based in Brussels, Belgium, the EWL is one of the longest-standing European level NGOs, and works closely with European Institutions and civil society partners. At the international level, the EWL has consultative status at the Council of Europe and the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and participates regularly in the activities of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).
The EWL's mission is to work towards the promotion and respect for women’s human rights, by supporting diversity among women and equality between women and men. The EWL seeks to voice the concerns of its member organisations across Europe by means of active policy and advocacy work, project-management, monitoring and awareness-raising across different policy areas. These include women’s economic and social position, women in decision-making, sexual and reproductive health and rights, immigration, integration and asylum. The EWL, through its European Policy Action Centre on Violence Against Women (EPAC-VAW), also works to combat all forms of violence against women. The EWL's EPAC-VAW also manages a dedicated European Observatory on this issue. Furthermore, the EWL supports the use of gender mainstreaming for the effective incorporation of a women's rights perspective into all European policies.
History.
In November 1987 in London 120 women, members of 85 organisations representing 50 millions individual members, came together and adopted two resolutions. The first called for the ‘creation of a structure for influence, open to all interested women’s organisations, to exert pressure on European and national institutions to ensure better defence and representation of women’s interest’. In a second resolution, the delegates called upon the European Commission to ‘lend its support for the organisation in early 1988 of a meeting with a view to the implementation of such a structure’. Support was granted and the European Women’s Lobby and its secretariat in Brussels were formally established in 1990. The EWL was founded in 1990 by Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom national coordinations and 17 large European-wide women’s organisations. 
At the time just twelve countries formed the European Union, then known as the European Communities (EC). Over the years, as new Member States joined the EC, new national co-ordinations became members of the EWL. While the EU enlarged to countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the EWL established links and cooperation with women’s organisations in these countries. 
The EWL currently has national co-ordinations in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. 21 European-wide member organisations are also members of the EWL. All these represent approximately 2500 direct member organisations.
The European Women’s Lobby was created in response to a growing awareness of the need to defend women’s interests at the European level since:

Otto Schniewind

Otto Schniewind (14 December 1887 – 26 March 1964) was a General Admiral with the Kriegsmarine during World War II and a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Career.
Schniewind entered the Kaiserliche Marine in 1907 as a cadet. During the First World War he served as a commander of torpedoboats. When the German fleet surrendered to the British he commanded a squadron of torpedo boats, with this he partook in the Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow, after which he was taken prisoner by the British.
After being released Schniewind continued to serve in the Reichsmarine. From 1925 to 1926 he served as adjutant to the Minister of War Otto Gessler. In 1932 Schniewind became captain of the light cruiser "Köln". In 1934 Schniewind was appointed to another staff function. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1937 and to vice admiral in 1940.
He served as Chief of Staff of the Seekriegsleitung from 1938 to 1941. After the sinking of the "Bismarck" Schniewind was appointed as successor to Günther Lütjens who was lost with the ship.

Osvaldo Álvarez Guerrero

Osvaldo Álvarez Guerrero (1940 – 27 July 2008) was an Argentine Radical Civic Union (UCR) politician. He served as Governor of Río Negro Province and as a National Deputy.
Born in Florida (a suburb of Buenos Aires, Álvarez Guerrero joined the Radical Civic Union of the People (UCRP, the more conservative faction led by Ricardo Balbín) in 1958 in his home town of Vicente López, a neighboring community. He became a lawyer and relocated to Viedma, in Río Negro Province, in 1964. UCR Governor Carlos Nielsen appointed him subsecretary of social affairs, serving in that post until the military coup of 28 June 1966 which toppled President Arturo Illia. That year he moved to San Carlos de Bariloche, where he practiced as a lawyer, taught philosophy and wrote for newspapers including "La Nación" and "Diario Río Negro". He later wrote several books, particularly on political history.
Upon the return of democracy, Álvarez Guerrero helped relaunch the UCR in Río Negro and was a leading player in the national internal Radical movement of Raúl Alfonsín and Conrado Storani. In 1973 he became President of the provincial committee of the UCR and was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. Following the coup of 1976, he was arrested and 'disappeared' for 72 hours, being released following protests by his party, including former President Illia, although he lost his passport and the right to leave the country.
In October 1983, following the return of democracy, Álvarez Guerrero was elected governor of Río Negro with 63% of the vote. He was a staunch federalist and a prime mover behind attempts to move the Argentine federal capital to Viedma. He was returned to the Chamber of Deputies in 1987. Álvarez Guerrero was elected first vice-president of the National Committee of the UCR in 1989, and in 1991 he became President of the National Convention. 
He became a vocal critic of the 1993 Olivos Pact between UCR leader Raúl Alfonsín and President Carlos Menem (of the opposititon Justicialist Party), and opposed the subsequent 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, resigning in 1994 over the nomination of his successor as governor, Horacio Massaccesi, as UCR candidate for President. He took part in the launch of the center-left ARI, although he distanced himself when his fellow activists left the UCR.

<doc id="18629400" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629400" title="Resident Certificate">
Resident Certificate

A Resident Certificate () is the identification card issued to residents of the Republic of China (Taiwan and associated islands) who do not hold a National Identification Card, namely foreigners and ROC nationals who do not have household registration in the Taiwan Area. 
The Alien Resident Certificate (), or ARC, is given to foreign residents in Taiwan, while the nearly identical Taiwan Area Resident Certificate (), or TARC, is given to nationals of the Republic of China resident in Taiwan without National Identification Cards, namely overseas Chinese, recently naturalized nationals, and residents of Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau (i.e. nationals of the People's Republic of China).
Alien Resident Certificate.
There are various methods of qualifying for an ARC, including undertaking sanctioned employment with a work permit, joining family members (including parents, children and spouses) who are themselves legal residents in the Republic of China, undertaking missionary work, investing in a local business, or studying at an approved institution. The relevant authorities may also choose to grant an ARC to foreigners who fit none of the above categories on an ad hoc basis. The ARC is issued by the National Immigration Agency.
The document itself is a plastic credit card-sized card with an embedded integrated circuit containing confidential personal data, and costs the applicant NT$1,000 per year. The electronic ARC cards replaced a paper version in 2007–8, and were intended to "not only bring new convenience to foreigners but would also contribute to the government's anti-forgery and anti-terrorism drives." As of October 2009 around 60,000 foreign residents have yet to exchange their old paper ARCs for a new IC card. The paper cards will be phased out on February 1, 2010. A multiple entry permit is now included on the card, whereas previously it was stamped separately in the holder's passport. The applicant may apply for a maximum of three years validity for the ARC, with some categories (for example missionary work or study) being limited to a maximum of one year at a time. Some types of ARC (Joining Family or Teaching) require a medical examination conducted at an approved hospital. Besides entitling the bearer to remain in Taiwan for the duration of the certificate's validity, the ARC is also needed to apply for an ROC driving licence.
There is also an Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (), or APRC available. To obtain the APRC, residence (classed as 183 days or more in a year) must have been maintained for five years. Other conditions apply, including meeting minimum salary or assets requirements, and a criminal record check carried out in the applicant's home country. The fee for an APRC is NT$10,000, and the holder must either remain in the country for 183 days per year or else arrange an exemption with the National Immigration Agency in order to maintain permanent residency. The APRC card itself does not carry an expiration date and thus renewals are not required. The law permitting permanent residency was established in 1999, and the first APRCs were issued in 2000.
Taiwan Area Resident Certificate.
The TARC is issued to ROC nationals resident in Taiwan who do not have household registration in Taiwan. Establishing household registration is required for a national over 14 years of age to possess a National Identification Card. Since the nationality law of the Republic of China makes no provision for "citizens" (公民) but merely defines those with ROC nationality as "nationals" (國民), ROC law makes a distinction between "registered nationals" (有戶籍國民) and "unregistered nationals" (無戶籍國民), with the former having the right of abode, right to vote, and other benefits of citizenship, while the latter are subject to deportation from Taiwan and need an entry permit to visit Taiwan. While "registered nationals" are entitled to hold the National Identification Card, "unregistered nationals" may only hold the TARC. Both groups are eligible to hold the Republic of China passport.
For adult "unregistered nationals" to become "registered nationals", and thus eligible for an ROC ID Card, they must reside in Taiwan for a certain period of time, during which they will hold a TARC instead of an ID Card. Currently, for "unregistered nationals" who have direct lineal relatives who are "registered nationals" (e.g. overseas-born Taiwanese) and foreigners who have naturalized as ROC nationals, this period is (1) continuously for one year, (2) 270 days per year for two years, or (3) 183 days per year for five years.
Academic and Business Travel Card.
With the stated aim of attracting exceptional foreign professionals to Taiwan, the government established an Academic and Business Travel Card in 2009.

Railway crew management in India

Indian Railway, the world's largest network (under a single management), consists of more than 100,000 Train Drivers/Assistant Drivers/Guards, which forms the basic functioning team, responsible for Train Operations.
Classification of Loco Pilots and guards.
How vigorous is the job profile can be noted from this very fact that the Railway recruits persons as 'Assistant Loco Pilot' . They work on freight trains for as long as 10–12 years. During this tenure they are supposed to work with experienced Train Drivers and perform only assisting work during the run of a locomotive i.e. a train. An Assistant Driver thus learns the tactics and dos and don'ts required for train operation. Thereafter they are promoted as 'Loco Pilot Shunter', after proper courses and practical trainings, wherein they are supposed to drive locomotives in sheds/yards at not more than 15 km/h speeds. After experiencing for not less than two years, they are promoted as 'Loco Pilot/Goods', who are always monitored by their respective 'Loco Inspectors'.
A train has typical an Assistant Loco Pilot and a Loco Pilot on the Locomotive. The Assistants are normally common but Loco Pilots fall in various categories like Goods Drivers (or Loco Pilots used for running goods trains), Passenger Driver (Driver used to run slow moving Passenger carrying Trains), Mail Express Driver (Driver used to run high speed Passenger carrying Trains) and Rajdhani Drivers (Used for very high speed passenger carrying trains). There is yet another category of crew called 'Shunters' who operate only in yards, for moving trains within a particular station yard. Normally Shunters work alone without an Assistant.
The train at the rear end has Guards as its crew. They are categorised as goods guards, passenger guards and mail express guards based on the type of train on which they are working.
Earlier working scenario.
The job of a Loco Pilot consists of irregular rest and working hours, eating disorders, and sleep disorders. That is why the Railway spends a lot on their trainings and resting time. They are booked from a crew changing point, informed well in advance, after ensuring that they have taken sufficient rest and completed all required trainings and requirements, those are mandatory for train operation. At the end of the journey, they are sent to well maintained rest rooms, given meals (home cooked) and rebooked back to their headquarters after giving minimum stipulated rest.
Latest developments.
Centre for Railway Information Systems New Delhi, an IT development unit for Indian Railways, has developed a software named 'Crew Management System', wherein bookings of this sensitive category of people, which was done manually till now and monitored at various levels by Inspectors and Officers, is arranged through software. Crew Management System(CMS) is a unique system in which accuracy and monitoring is automatically maintained. The software system was rolled out in December 2007 and already installed at about 2200 data entry nodes at over 290 crew booking points. These are spread over entire Indian Railways. CMS at present has a database covering 89,000 crew members and over 30000 crew members are being booked daily through the system. The work has been completed and provided with Thin clients connected to a server cluster at CRIS, wherein all the functions like crew bookings, call served to crews, their signing on duties are done through computers after ensuring their rest,training and medical particulars. The job which was done manually till a few years back is now monitored automatically. Not only it has a single data base of all the running staff of Indian Railways, but also have an all around reports(more than 500 reports of these crews are visible to the monitoring authorities of the Railways). All the officers sitting in their offices can monitor performance reports of the train operating staff. This enhances the performance planning by the officers. The Ministry of Railways is also doing a great job by motivating such projects and giving sufficient funds for same. A Project which was initially started in Nov 2006 with a team of 5-6 software persons is now managed by a GM rank officer with a dedicated team of software developers and domain experts, who are basically attached to driving jobs since the last 15–20 years. The system caters for All gauges BG, MG, NG now.
Brief technical particulars.
The CMS software is Industry standard software using middle ware and products, hardware components and LAN/WAN network components. The business transactions are transacted so as to provide timely information with increased productivity and reduced paper work to a great extent at the lobby locations. The CMS system is being implemented in the Railways Lobbies at 306 lobby (Location where Railways crew are booked) locations with touch screen along with biometric devices for Sign-On/Off of crew from their duties. The CMS software uses FOIS and Railways network with adequate provision for security in the system so that it is not be vulnerable to hacking from outside. It also has on-line application processing (distributed) & data inter-viewing at the Divisional and Zonal offices.
The different applications of CMS require various levels of organization hierarchy to access it via a web browser. This application extends to various stakeholders and provides a single window interface to the Train Crew.
The CMS software is a centralized architecture using n-tier Java EE architecture with Web Services/Struts framework which works in online mode. All the stakeholders access the applications after user authentication and authorization. The solution has high scalability, flexibility, reliability and is complaint to industry Open Standard specifications. The software solution is :-
• Compliant to n-tier Java EE architecture.
• Seamless integration of enterprise systems with the existing business applications.
• Single sign-on feature.
• Open-standards platform supports web service.
• Extending existing applications for multiple devices.
• Utilizing full advantage of device features for management and interactions from a central location i.e. CRIS.
• User friendliness.
• End to end linux based System.
• Browser access via kiosks and thin clients access.
• Comprehensive data validations during capturing.
• Industry standards security features.
• Interface with SMS gateway for information dissemination and verification.
• Online pre-formatted and flexible period report generation.
• Highly flexible and high available solution with 24 x 7 uptime.
• Context sensitive help.
The software is in house software assisted by IBM & HCL in the designs and performance optimisation of the software. These steps are primarily for ensuring a robust and scalable architecture that conforms to open standards and promotes inter-operability duly taking care of the security concerns. The design and implementation of the CMS is expected to lead to the evolution of a truly robust architecture based on the principle of inter-operability and open standards.
SMS feature.
The Crew Management System software has a unique feature of booking the crew through SMS. It is sent to the crew through the central database to serve it a call.If the crew acknowledges the call by sending back an acknowledgment through SMS, the crew is booked. This is done for those crews who reside farther than 7–8 km from the crew booking location, else a call boy is sent for the same.Thus the software facilitates faster crew booking.
System generated alerts are also sent to the required personnel in the following manner:-
a) Morning position of crew strength at various crew booking locations.
b) Alerts for crew strength at particular crew booking point going below a critical limit.
c) Automated alerts for their nominated Inspector, for crew becoming due for monitoring.
d) The crew can have his personnel information like turn of crew booking, Status, PME, Mileage and other Training due dates on his Mobile.
e) Congratulations on birthdays to crew members of whom date of birth are with the database.
Biometrics sign on/off feature.
With the help of the Crew Management System software, sign on/sign off of crew members has become extremely easy. At the lobby, they are provided with Kiosks, where they use their thumb impression to sign on/sign off.This has removed the need of their signing in registers or remembering passwords. It is very user friendly and easily adaptable by the crew. Also, it has increased security and authentication as it eliminates the possibility of Proxy reporting.It is legally binding. Now BA (Breathalyzer) capabilities are being added to Kiosks.It is very important from the point of view of safety running of the train. Herein, the crew blows from his mouth into the device, and if there is any alcohol content found,a thorough check is done.
Central server architecture.
Central server architecture consists of a set of 13 server which work in unison. Users access the CMS applications via browser interface. As per the CMS application requirements, the application is deployed in centralized environments with online LAN/WAN (FOIS) connectivity. The CMS system supports the stakeholders and has a centralized architecture based on the deployment pattern. The CMS system supports the browser-based clients originated from respective places.
The details of servers are
Benefits of computerization of Crew Management System.
• All crewing information is readily available through a common data platform.
• All offices are synchronized at all times.
• Graphical User Interface for planning as well as for running daily operations with full checking mechanism.
• Time saving: crewing and payroll data need only be entered once.
• A combined system for crewing and payroll saves time and money 
The software solution automates the day-to-day business functions of the crew thereby providing information of their status, rostering their duty allocations, providing information on the availability of crew at their home station and assigning crew to the trains. All this leads to better crew management. CMS has been developed to bring in transparency and greater accuracy of information so that decision makers can take effective business decisions to control crew and optimize on crew utilization. It provides for global tracking of all the crew on the CMS system in real time whether the crew is on train, resting at HQ, resting at outstation, on leave or training.
The system gives the planner optimum flexibility to construct highly efficient crew duty blocks resulting in improved crew utilization based on all national and company legal requirements. This can create corresponding reductions in manpower and costs. The solution architect for the CMS Solution is Environmental friendly and has been designed in such a way that the CMS uses the TFT and thin client technology which saves lot of power for each crew booking locations over the conventional PC's and CRT monitors based system.
CMS is fully integrated, it maintain complete overall day-to-day administrative and operational control of the total crew resources throughout Rail route network. Quickly identifies additional crew resources to meet unforeseen situations. Availability, priority of presentation and any restrictions are listed in accordance with User-defined rules. Automatically identifies illegal or unqualified crews in accordance with pre-defined User rail regulations. Automatically generates crew schedule.
CMS database holds all the necessary information about each crew member including: basic data such as name, address, gender, nationality, date of birth and phone numbers
personal skills such as language speaking and professional skills such as the types of Crew and trainers' qualifications complete record of promotions - changes of rank, Keep a record of all training taken and the dates when they need to be renewed.
To break the monotony of crew while waiting for their turn at the crew booking lobby a quiz has been provided. QUICK implies Quiz for Improving Crew Knowledge. This is a crew knowledge evaluation and improvement Game.

Tirol Castle

Tirol Castle or "Castle Tyrol" (, ) is a castle in the "comune" (municipality) of Tirol near Meran, in the Burggrafenamt district of South Tyrol, Italy. It was the ancestral seat of the Counts of Tyrol and gave the whole Tyrol region its name.
History.
The castle hill has been inhabited since ancient times. Several artefacts and one field of graves from the early Middle Ages have been identified. Archeologists have excavated a church with three apses dating from the early Christian period.
The first castle was built before 1100. The second construction phase including the keep dates to 1139/40. A third phase of construction took place in the second half of the 13th century under Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol. In 1347 Meinhard's granddaughter Countess Margaret of Tyrol was besieged here by the forces of the Luxembourg king Charles IV. The castle remained the seat of Tyrol's sovereigns until 1420, when the Habsburg archduke Frederick IV moved the administrative seat to Innsbruck north of the Brenner Pass.
In modern times parts of the castle fell into the so-called ""Köstengraben"", a steep gorge. It was even sold in order to be used as a quarry. In the 19th century the castle was restored; the keep was rebuilt in 1904.
Regarding art history, the frescos of the castle's chapel are of special interest as well as two Romanesque portals with opulent marble sculptures showing legendary creatures, religious themes, and geometric ornaments.
Today, Castle Tyrol houses the South Tyrolean Museum of History. Next to the castle there is a falconry with a nursing ward for birds of prey.

<doc id="18629471" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629471" title="Dart 18">
Dart 18

The Dart 18 is a one-design long glassfibre sailing catamaran. It is designed to be sailed by two people and can achieve speeds of up to 20 knots.
This is reflected in its Portsmouth Yardstick of 805 and D-PN of 76.3
History.
The Dart 18 was designed in 1975 as a One Design Class by Rodney March, who was also responsible for the design of the Olympic Tornado class catamaran. The very first Dart 18, designed and built in Falmouth, Cornwall, is now owned by the National Maritime Museum Cornwall. Up to the present, a number of improvements have been made, but the original concept was preserved though strict class rules. More than 8300 boats have been built up to 2013, which are sailed in more than 16 nations on 4 continents. 
Since 2012, Windsport International holds the worldwide license to build the Dart 18. 
The boats are manufactured since 2005 at Collins Fibreglass Plastics in South Africa and in Europe.
The World Championship results can be found here.
Design.
The hulls of the Dart 18 are similar to the Tornado catamaran, but without centreboards. 
Instead, the lower part of the hulls have skegs typical for a beach catamaran.
The hull material is glassfibre. Both hulls are filled with flotation inserts to preserve buoyancy
in case of damage. The inside of each hull can be reached through a hatch cover located
at the rear of each hull. The boat is assembled by attaching the main and rear beams 
to the hulls with spring-loaded retaining clips, and lacing the trampoline to the beams and hulls.
The two rudders are removable without tools, retract on impact with the beach, and can be locked in the up position.
The rigging consists of a rotating mast held by a forestay and two shroud wires. The shrouds can be adjusted by simply moving the bolts in the chainplates. The Dart 18 mast does not have spreaders.
There is a trapeze for the crew.
The mainsail does not have a boom, has nine full battens, and is controlled by a main sheet with a 7:1 
mechanical advantage. 
The jib sail has two short battens, and is controlled by a jib sheet with a 2:1 mechanical advantage.
The main sheet block and both jib sheet blocks have a ratchet and a cleat.
A gennaker sail can be added, but is not legal for racing. This is usually combined with a jib furling system. The boat can also be sailed by one person, without a foresail, with a D-PN of 78.7.

<doc id="18629502" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629502" title="Context-sensitive user interface">
Context-sensitive user interface

A context sensitive user interface is one which can automatically choose from a multiplicity of options based on the current or previous state(s) of the program operation."Context sensitivity" is almost ubiquitous in current graphical user interfaces, usually in the form of context menus. Context sensitivity, when operating correctly, should be practically transparent to the user.
For example:
Clicking on a text document automatically opens the document in a word processing environment. The user does not have to specify what type of program opens the file under standard conditions.
The same methodology applies to other file types e.g.:
The user-interface may also provide "Context sensitive" feedback, such as changing the appearance of the mouse pointer or cursor, changing the menu color, or with applicable auditory or tactile feedback.
Reasoning and advantages of context sensitivity.
The primary reason for introducing context sensitivity is to simplify the user interface.
Advantages include :
Disadvantages.
Context sensitive actions may be perceived as dumbing down of the user interface - leaving the operator at a loss as to what to do when the computer decides to perform an unwanted action. Additionally non-automatic procedures may be hidden or obscured by the context sensitive interface causing an increase in user workload for operations the designers did not foresee.
A poor implementation can be more annoying than helpful - a classic example of this is Office assistant.
Implementation.
At the simplest level each possible action is reduced to a single most likely action - The action performed is based on a single variable (such as file extension). In more complicated 
implementations multiple factors can be assessed such as the users previous actions, the size of the file, the programs in current use, metadata etc.
The method is not only limited to the response to imperative button presses and mouse clicks - pop up menus can be pruned and/or altered, or a web search can prune results based on previous searches.
At higher levels of implementation "context sensitive" actions require either larger amounts of meta-data, extensive case analysis based programming, or other artificial intelligence algorithms.
In computer and video games.
Context sensitivity is important in video games - especially those controlled by a gamepad, joystick or computer mouse in which the number of buttons available is limited. It is primarily applied when the player is in a certain place and is used to interact with a person or object. For example, if the player is standing next to an NPC, an option may come up allowing the player to talk with him/her.
Implementations range from the embryonic 'Quick Time Event' to context sensitive sword combat in which the attack used depends on the position and orientation of both the player and opponent, as well as the virtual surroundings. A similar range of use is found in the 'action button' which dependent on the in game position of the player's character may cause the avatar to pick something up, open a door, grab a rope, punch a monster or opponent, or smash an object.
The response does not have to be player activated - an on-screen device may only be shown in certain circumstances, e.g. 'targeting' cross hairs in a flight combat game may indicate the player should fire. An alternative implementation is to monitor the input from the player (e.g. level of button pressing activity) and use that to control the pace of the game in an attempt to maximize enjoyment or to control the excitement or ambiance.
The method has become increasingly important as more complex games are designed for machines with few buttons (keyboard-less consoles). Bennet Ring commented (in 2006) that ""Context-sensitive" is the new lens flare".
Context-sensitive help.
Context sensitive help is a common implementation of context sensitivity, a single help button is actioned and the help page or menu will open a specific page or topic related

Mattheus Pinna da Encarnaçao

Mattheus Pinna da Encarnaçao (23 August 1687 – 18 December 1764) was a Brazilian Benedictine writer and theologian.
Life.
He was born at Rio de Janeiro. On 3 March 1703, he became a Benedictine at the Abbey of Nossa Senhora do Montserrate at Rio de Janeiro, where he also studied the humanities and philosophy under José da Natividade. After studying theology at the monastery of Bahia, he was ordained priest 24 March 1708, and appointed professor of philosophy and theology. 
Along with Gaspar da Madre de Deus (died about 1780), Antonio de São Bernardo (died 1774) and a few others, he was considered among the most learned Benedictines of his province. In 1726 he was elected abbot of the monastery at Rio de Janeiro, but soon after his election incurred the displeasure of Luiz Vahia Monteiro, the Governor of Brazil, who banished him from his monastery in 1727. 
He escaped to Portugal, became very influential at Court and was restored to his monastery by Cardinal João da Motta e Silva in 1729. He held the office of abbot repeatedly thereafter; both at Rio de Janeiro (1729–31 and 1739) and at Bahia in 1746. In 1732 he was elected provincial abbot, in which capacity he visited the distant monasteries of Brazil, despite the difficulty of travel. He was again elected provincial abbot in 1752, but this time he declined, preferring to spend his old age in prayer and retirement. He died in Rio de Janeiro.

Crémaillère

A Crémaillère is a French, mechanical term for the rack, or a straight bar with teeth on one edge designed to work into the teeth of a wheel or a pinion (French pignon) that predates the Renaissance. The term was generally applied in English to engineering applications which had notched, toothed or drilled surface, even when only visually so, such as the edge of the staircase. The term is also applied to the rack railway.
During the 17th to 19th centuries the term was widely applied to lines of entrenchment that are usually formed in a saw-tooth pattern, known as indented lines, particularly during sieges. These lines are usually employed on banks of rivers, or on ground which is more elevated than, or which commands, that of the enemy. The defence of these lines is sometimes strengthened by double redans, and flat bastions constructed at intervals, along their front. Just such a constructed defence was used at Centreville in 1862 during the American Civil War.
The term is also applied in Artillery to refer to an indented battery, or à Crémaillère constructed with salient and re-entering angles for obtaining an oblique, as well as a direct fire, and to afford shelter form an enfilade fire of the enemy.

Buddhavacana

Buddhavacana, from Pali and Sanskrit, means "the Word of the Buddha." It refers to the works accepted within a tradition as being the teachings of the Buddha. All traditions recognize certain texts as buddhavacana which make no claim to being the actual words of the historical Buddha, such as the "Theragāthā" and "Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra".
In Indian Buddhism.
According to Donald Lopez, criteria for determining what should be considered buddhavacana was developed at an early stage, and that the early formulations do not suggest that the Dharma is limited to what was spoken by the historical Buddha. The Mahāsāṃghika and the Mūlasarvāstivāda considered both the Buddha's discourses, as well those of the Buddha's disciples, to be buddhavacana.
A number of different beings such as buddhas, disciples of the buddha, ṛṣis, and devas were considered capable to transmitting buddhavacana. The content of such a discourse was then to be collated with the sūtras, compared with the Vinaya, and evaluated against the nature of the Dharma. These texts may then be certified as true buddhavacana by a buddha, a saṃgha, a small group of elders, or one knowledgeable elder.
Surveying the voluminous corpus of Buddhist texts that originated in India, Ronald Davidson writes that Indian Buddhists were prolific writers of buddhavacana literature, and that was a special quality of Indian Buddhism:
In Theravada Buddhism.
In Theravada Buddhism, the standard collection of buddhavacana is the Pali Canon. The oral tradition of the Theravadin recension of Buddhist texts dates back to the time of the Buddha and was arranged in its current form 80 BC.
In East Asian Buddhism.
In East Asian Buddhism, what is considered buddhavacana is collected in the Chinese Buddhist canon. The most common edition of this is the Taishō Tripiṭaka.
According to Venerable Hsuan Hua from the tradition of Chinese Buddhism, there are five types of beings who may speak the sutras of Buddhism: a buddha, a disciple of a buddha, a deva, a ṛṣi, or an emanation of one of these beings; however, they must first receive certification from a buddha that its contents are true Dharma. Then these sutras may be properly regarded as buddhavacana.
In Tibetan Buddhism.
In Tibetan Buddhism, what is considered buddhavacana is collected in the Kangyur. The East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist canons always combined Buddhavacana with other literature in their standard collected editions. However, the general view of what is and is not buddhavacana is broadly similar between East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism.

Ministerstyre

Ministerstyre ("ministerial rule") in Swedish describes a deviation from the rule that individual government ministers in Sweden do not have the right to influence or decide the handling of individual cases at government agencies. There is no equivalent term in English because the constitutional tradition of Sweden is different from those of English-speaking countries.
In Sweden, this is unconstitutional, for two reasons. Government agencies (similar but not the same as executive agencies), which are separate organisational entities from the ministries, are fundamentally independent in their handling of individual cases, and only the government (by collective decision-making) can issue instructions to agencies. Thus, a version of the independence of the political power that courts have in most countries applies to a larger set of agencies in Sweden.
The type of decision-making unconstitutional in Sweden is common practice in most other countries such as the United Kingdom, but shares similarities with practice in the United States in which interference by ministers is limited by congressional oversight not under executive control. In Sweden, the Government and the Riksdag have regulatory power and are responsible for creating laws (in the case of the Riksdag) and ordinances (in the case of the Government) governing the workings of the different agencies. The reasoning behind this is to prevent government corruption and to ensure that laws and regulations are applied equally. It also motivates the Government and Riksdag to get rid of hard-to-interpret or problematic laws and regulations. There are rare exceptions to this distinction, such as when a natural disaster or war occurs and there is a need for a shorter chain of command.
In practice, much of the ministerial influence is handled by informal coordination rather than by formal decisions by ministers or the government. The government also appoints the heads of the independent agencies and has the power to remove them.
Basis.
Chapter 11. art. 7 of The (Swedish) Instrument of Government:
"No public authority, including the Riksdag and the decision-making bodies of local authorities, may determine how an administrative authority shall decide in a particular case relating to the exercise of public authority vis-à-vis a private subject or a local authority, or relating to the application of law."

University of Wales by-election, 1943

The University of Wales by-election, 1943 was a parliamentary by-election held in the United Kingdom between 25 and 29 January 1943 for the House of Commons constituency of University of Wales.
Previous MP.
The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), Ernest Evans (1885–1965) had been appointed a County Court Judge in 1942.
Evans was admitted to the bar in 1910 and became a King's Counsel (KC) in 1937.
After serving as private secretary to the Prime Minister David Lloyd George, he was elected as Coalition Liberal MP for Cardiganshire at a by-election in 1921. He held the seat at the 1922 general election as a National Liberal candidate, but was defeated standing as a Liberal at the 1923 general election by the Independent Liberal Rhys Hopkin Morris.
Evans did not stand again in Cardiganshire, but at the 1924 general election he defeated the Christian pacifist George Maitland Lloyd Davies to win the University of Wales constituency as a Liberal.
Candidates.
The election took place during the Second World War. Under an agreement between the Conservative, Labour and Liberal parties, who were participating in a wartime coalition, the party holding a seat would not be opposed by the other two at a by-election. Accordingly the Liberal Party nominated a candidate, but no Labour or Conservative representative was put forward. Plaid Cymru, which was not a party to the electoral agreement, selected a candidate and three independent candidates also stood; so a contested poll took place.
The list of candidates below is set out in descending order of the number of votes received at the by-election.
Liberal Party.
The Liberal Party candidate was Professor William John Gruffydd (1881–1954), who was Professor of Celtic at University College, Cardiff from 1918 until 1946 and then an Emeritus Professor. He was editor of "Y Llenor" ("The Literary Man") from 1922 until 1951.
Gruffydd came from a nonconformist, radical family, and took an interest in Welsh politics and social questions. He was at one time a member of Plaid Cymru and served as its deputy vice-president in 1937.
Gruffydd had voiced doubts about "Plaid Cymru" party president Saunders Lewis' ideas since 1933, and by 1943 he had joined the Liberal party. The "brilliant but wayward" Gruffydd was a favourite with Welsh-speaking intellectuals.
Gruffydd was elected to Parliament as a Liberal MP for the University of Wales seat on 29 January 1943. He and Saunders Lewis had effectively split the Welsh-speaking community. He was comfortably re-elected in the 1945 general election and sat until the abolition of University seats in 1950. He did not stand again for Parliament.
Plaid Cymru.
Representing Plaid Cymru in the by-election was its President, (John) Saunders Lewis, who had previously contested the University seat at the 1931 general election.
Lewis (15 October 1893 – 1 September 1985) was a Welsh poet, dramatist, historian, literary critic and political activist. He was a prominent Welsh nationalist and founder of the Welsh National Party ("Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru", later known as Plaid Cymru). Lewis is usually acknowledged as among the most prominent figures of 20th century Welsh-language literature. Lewis was a 1970 Nobel nominee for literature, and in 2005 came 10th in a BBC Wales poll for Wales' "greatest-ever person".
The election effectively split the Welsh-speaking intelligentsia, and left Lewis embittered with politics, and he retired from direct political involvement. However, the experience proved invaluable for "Plaid Cymru", as they began to refer to themselves, as "for the first time they were taken seriously as a political force." The by-election campaign led directly to "considerable growth" in the party's membership.

Agon Shu

Agon Shū and Hinayana.
Agon Shū believes that it takes its principles directly from the Buddha's teachings, the Agon Sutras. In the original Sanskrit language, these are called the Agamas or the Agama Sutras, literally meaning "the teaching of the Buddha". According to Agon Shū, these sutras are the true records of the teachings of Gautama Buddha, whereas Mahayana Buddhism is a deviation from the original teachings of the Buddha. The word Hinayana, meaning 'Lesser Vehicle' is rejected as a derogatory term.
In particular, members of Agon Shū trace their practices to the Agon Sutras, in which the Buddha is reported to have taught his disciples a method known as the "Seven Systems and 37 practices for attaining Supreme Wisdom".
Seiyū Kiriyama.
Seiyū Kiriyama was in a difficult phase of his life, due to illness, when he felt himself rescued by the bodhisattva Juntei-Kannon. He founded the Kannon Jikei-kai (Society of the Mercy of Kannon Bosatsu) in 1954 in Yokohama. He devoted himself to the study of divination, the Lotus Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism, which he reinterpreted in his own way. He also studied the historicla development of the Buddhist traditions in Sri Lanka and India. The Kannon Jikeikai based itself on the Kannon Sutra in Mahayana Buddhism. Kiriyama led the Kannon Jikeikai until 1978. 
Kiriyama, who is believed by his followers to have rediscovered the actual method of attaining enlightenment in the Agon Sutras, founded Agon Shū in 1978. He has since written more than 50 books, of which millions of copies have been sold, and in which he expounds the beliefs, significance and goals of Agon Buddhism. Although it asserts that it is rooted in ancient Buddhism, Agon Shū brings together three major currents of Buddhist thought: Northern Buddhism, Southern Buddhism and the Esoteric school of Tibetan Buddhism.
Since 1986, when Kiriyama supposedly obtained certain relics from high authorities in Sri Lanka, members of Agon Shū have worshipped Shakyamuni Buddha as well as Juntei Kannon. 
As of 1989, Agon-Shuu had 1,358 priests, serving about 580,000 believers. Members take part in religious life with the help of modern means of communication.Their activities combines study of the Agamas (called Agon in Japanese, Shū meaning school/sect/denomination) with the practice of esoteric rituals.

Townsville Street Circuit

Townsville Street Circuit is a temporary street circuit located in Townsville, Queensland, Australia.
The circuit.
Townsville Street Circuit is a reminiscent of the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit. It winds its way through Reid Park where specially constructed roads form approximately 70 percent of the circuit. Rod Nash Racing’s Paul Dumbrell suggested it is a high grip circuit. Ford Performance Racing (FPR) driver Mark Winterbottom suggested the circuit is like a standard racing circuit but in the middle of a city. It is a tough circuit that can catch drivers out. Winterbottom described the first corner is almost a clone to the turn eight at Adelaide Street Circuit which he tackled it very aggressively because it looks high speed with great passing opportunity. The circuit quickly became a favourite of the V8 supercars' drivers. The circuit's pit building is a permanent construction that can be used all year round for all sorts of events. There are five viewing mounds and grandstands that can seat approximately 12,000.
V8 Supercars.
On 28 July 2008, the official V8 Supercar website reported that the Queensland Sports Minister, Judy Spence, said the State Government will contribute $2.5 million annually for the first five years of the event. The 2009 Dunlop Townsville 400 was held from 10–12 July. Sucrogen is the naming rights sponsor the race in 2010 and 2011.

Crossing the bridge noodles

Crossing-the-bridge noodles is a rice noodle soup from Yunnan province, China. It is one of the most well-known dishes in Yunnan cuisine.
Description.
The dish is served with a large bowl of boiling hot broth and the soup ingredients separate. The soup ingredients are served on a cutting board or plate and include raw vegetables and lightly cooked meats. Common ingredients include thin slices of ham, chunks of chicken, chicken skin, strips of bean curd sheets, chives, sprouts and rice noodles. Once added into the broth, it cooks quickly with a layer of schmaltz and oil glistening on top. The soup takes a few minutes to cook, and it is then spooned out into small bowls. Jim Thurman of LA Weekly writes that "with the rice noodles and fresh chicken, it's reminiscent of an extremely subtle version of Vietnamese pho ga. This happens to be, as Yunnan shares a border with Vietnam."
Claims of name origin.
One story that has gained traction begins with a scholar who was studying hard for his imperial exams on a small island. His wife, who would bring him food, found that by the time she had crossed the bridge to the island the soup would be cold and the noodles were soggy. She then decided to load a large earthen pot with boiling broth with a layer of oil on top that would act as insulation and keep the broth warm. The noodles and other ingredients were kept in separate container, and when she arrived, she mixed the two containers together for a warm soup.
Another claim regarding the origin of the name comes from the way the ingredients are transferred between containers. The process is similar to crossing a bridge between bowls, and hence it is called "crossing-the-bridge" noodles.
There are reportedly many other variations on the origin of the name.
Varieties.
The main ingredient of the noodles is rice. Rice vermicelli production is quite different in many regions. In particular, in Kunming, Yunnan, there are two varieties such as "dry paste" or "sour paste". The production process differs depending on individual preferences and tastes. The distinction is quite simple, "sour paste", as the name suggests, tastes a little sour, but obviously it is characterized by a relatively thick and soft rice noodle. The "dry paste" does not have the sourness of the sour paste, and the noodle is relatively thin and more rigid. The older people in Kunming think the "sour paste" noodles is more authentic. Most people in Yunnan think the Kunming noodle does not satisfy their taste buds, and generally believes Mengzi County and Jianshui County makes better noodles.
Now, as people's tastes change, all kinds of noodle varieties are flooding onto the market. Kunming people now do not necessarily pick a "dry paste" or "sour paste." At present people prefer the more efficient, slippery "water-washed rice noodle" and "purple rice noodle", one that is mixed with purple rice.
Status.
The development of Guoqiao mixian has changed people's eating habits over the years, especially breakfast. People's eating habits in the course of normal life should be just as simple as Guoqiao mixian represents, simply crossing the bridge. Generally in street markets, the hot fresh rice noodle is put into bowl of boiling water for about half a minute and then adding colored sauce in the bowl. This is known as the "hat" of the sauce. Guoqiao mixian served in markets in the morning are usually completed in one minute.
There are a few franchised restaurants across the bridge which serves more intricate or elaborate Guoqiao mixian dishes. Normally Guoqiao mixian is ordered in a set, a set of bridge noodle will cost 10 to 50 Yuan. Ordering the Guoqiao mixian with more ingredients, meat, or vegetables, will command higher prices.
Ingredients.
The general ingredients of "guoqiao mixiangg include: 
It is generally served first with a bowl of boiling hot soup, with temperatures over 100 degrees Celsius. The attendants will then be on the other side and put the ingredients into the bowl, generally in the order from raw to cooked: meat first, then quail eggs, and then vegetables. Finally, perform the noodle "crossing" with chopsticks and the dish is ready to be consumed. The amount of oil, chili, and vinegar one puts in the bowl varies according to personal taste.

Alexander Isius

Alexander (Gr. ), surnamed Isius, the chief commander of the Aetolians, was a man of considerable ability and eloquence for an Aetolian. In 198 BC he was present at a colloquy held at Nicaea on the Maliac Gulf, and spoke against Philip V of Macedon, saying that the king ought to be compelled to quit Greece, and to restore to the Aetolians the towns which had formerly been subject to them. Philip, indignant at such a demand being made by an Aetolian, answered him in a speech from his ship. Soon after this meeting, he was sent as ambassador of the Aetolians to Rome, where, together with other envoys, he was to treat with the senate about peace, but at the same time to bring accusations against Philip. In 197 BC, Alexander again took part in a meeting, at which T. Quinctius Flamininus with his allies and king Philip were present, and at which peace with Philip was discussed. Alexander dissuaded his friends from any peaceful arrangement with Philip. In 195 BC, when a congress of all the Greek states that were allied with Rome was convoked by Flamininus at Corinth, for the purpose of considering the war that was to be undertaken against the Spartan king Nabis, Alexander spoke against the Athenians, and also insinuated that the Romans were acting fraudulently towards Greece. When in 189 BC, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, after his victory over Antiochus III the Great, was expected to march into Aetolia, the Aetolians sent envoys to Athens and Rhodes; and Alexander Isius, together with Phaneas and Lycopus, were sent to Rome to sue for peace. Alexander, now an old man, was at the head of the embassy; but he and his colleagues were made prisoners in Cephallenia by the Epeirotes, for the purpose of extorting a heavy ransom. Alexander, however, although he was very wealthy, refused to pay it, and was accordingly kept in captivity for some days, after which he was liberated, at the command of the Romans, without any ransom.

Premise.
Fifteen-year-old True Jackson was selling sandwiches and lemonade with her friend Ryan in the fashion district in New York City. When she is complimented by fashion designer Max Madigan, founder and CEO of Mad Style, Max realizes the clothes True is wearing are his designs, but True had altered them to suit her own purposes. Max likes the altered design, and hires True to be the VP (Vice President) of his fashion company's youth apparel division. True hires her best friend Lulu to be her assistant after firing Cricket, her former assistant who was upset and bitter about being surpassed in the business by a kid. With Lulu's and Ryan's help, True works to be the best she can be despite various obstacles such as her self-centered co-worker Amanda, who is less than enthusiastic to be working with a teenager, but the truth is that she is jealous of True because of how Max pays more attention to True than he does to her.

Maffei 1

Maffei 1 is a giant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. Once believed to be a member of the Local Group of galaxies, it is now known to belong to its own group, the IC 342/Maffei Group. It was named after Paolo Maffei, who discovered it and the neighboring Maffei 2 in 1967 via their infrared emissions.
Maffei 1 is a slightly flattened core type elliptical galaxy. It has a boxy shape and is made mainly of old metal-rich stars. It has a tiny blue nucleus in which stars continue to form. Like all large ellipticals it contains a significant population of globular clusters. Maffei 1 is situated at an estimated distance of 3–4 Mpc from the Milky Way. It may be the closest giant elliptical galaxy.
Maffei 1 lies in the Zone of Avoidance and is heavily obscured by the Milky Way's stars and dust. If it were not obscured, it would be one of the largest (about 3/4 the size of the full Moon) brightest and best-known galaxies in the sky. It can be observed visually, using a 30–35 cm or bigger telescope under a very dark sky.
Discovery.
The Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei was one of the pioneers of infrared astronomy. In the 1950s and 60s, in order to obtain high quality images of celestial objects in the very near infrared part of the spectrum (the I-band, 680–880 nm), he used chemically hyper-sensitized standard Eastman emulsions I-N. To achieve the hyper-sensitization he immersed them in 5% ammonia solution for 3–5 minutes. This procedure increased their sensitivity by an order of magnitude. Between 1957 and 1967 Maffei observed many different objects using this technique, including globular clusters and planetary nebulae. Some of those objects were not visible at all on blue light (250–500 nm) sensitive plates.
The galaxy Maffei 1 was discovered on a hyper-sensitized I-N photographic plate exposed on 29 September 1967 with the Schmidt telescope at Asiago Observatory. Maffei found Maffei 1, together with its companion spiral galaxy Maffei 2, while searching for diffuse nebulae and T Tauri stars. The object had an apparent size up to 50″ in the near infrared but was not visible on the corresponding blue light sensitive plate. Its spectrum lacked any emission or absorption lines. Later it was shown to be radio-quiet as well. In 1970 Hyron Spinrad suggested that Maffei 1 is a nearby heavily obscured giant elliptical galaxy. Maffei 1 would be among the ten brightest galaxies in the northern sky if not situated behind the Milky Way.
Due to the its faintness, visual observations of Maffei 1 require a telescope at least 30–35 cm in diameter, high quality sky maps and a very dark sky.
Distance.
Maffei 1 is located only 0.55° from the galactic plane in the middle of the zone of avoidance and suffers from about 4.7 magnitudes of extinction (a factor of about 1/70) in visible light. In addition to extinction, observation of Maffei 1 is further hindered by the fact that it is covered by myriads of faint Milky Way stars, which can easily be confused with its own. As a result, determining its distance has been particularly difficult.
In 1971, soon after its discovery, Hyron Spinrad estimated the distance to Maffei 1 at about 1 Mpc, which would place it within the Local Group of galaxies. In 1983 this estimate was revised up to 2.1 Mpc by Ronald Buta and Marshall McCall using the general relation between the luminosity and velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies. That distance puts Maffei 1 well outside the Local Group, but close enough to have influenced it in the past.
In 1993 Gerard Luppino and John Tonry used surface brightness fluctuations to derive a new distance estimate to Maffei 1 of . Later in 2001, Tim Davidge and Sidney van den Bergh used adaptive optics to observe the brightest asymptotic giant branch stars in Maffei 1 and concluded that it is located at the distance 4.4 Mpc from the Sun. The latest determination of the distance to Maffei 1, which is based on the re-calibrated luminosity/velocity dispersion relation for the elliptical galaxies and the updated extinction, is .
The larger (≥3 Mpc) distances reported in the past 20 years would imply that Maffei 1 has never been close enough to the Local Group to significantly influence its dynamics.
Maffei 1 moves away from the Sun at the speed of about 66 km/s. Its velocity relative to the Local Group's center of mass is, however, 297 km/s away. That means that Maffei 1 participates in the general expansion of the Universe.
Physical properties.
Size and shape.
Maffei 1 is a giant elliptical galaxy classified as type E3 in the Hubble classification scheme. This means that it is slightly flattened, its semi-minor axis being 70% of its semi-major axis. Maffei 1 has also a boxy shape (E(b)3 type), while its central region (radius ≈ 34 pc) is deficient in light emission as compared to the r1/4 law, meaning that Maffei 1 is a core type elliptical. Both the boxy shape and the presence of an underluminous core are typical of intermediate to massive ellipticals.
The apparent dimensions of Maffei 1 depend strongly on the wavelength of light because of the heavy obscuration by the Milky Way. In blue light it is 1–2′ across while in the near infrared its major axis reaches 23′—more than 3/4 of the Moon's diameter. At a distance of 3 Mpc this corresponds to approximately 23 kpc. The total visible absolute magnitude of Maffei 1, MV=−20.8, is comparable to that of the Milky Way.
Nucleus.
Maffei 1 possesses a tiny blue nucleus at its center approximately 1.2 pc across. It contains about 29 solar masses of ionized hydrogen. This implies that it has undergone recent star formation. There are no signs of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the center of Maffei 1. The X-ray emission from the center is extended and likely comes from a number of stellar sources.
Stars and stellar clusters.
Maffei 1 is mainly made of old metal-rich stars more than 10 billion years in age. As a large elliptical galaxy, Maffei 1 is expected to host a significant population of globular clusters (about 1100). However, due to heavy intervening absorption, ground-based observations for a long time failed to identify any of them. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2000 revealed about 20 globular cluster candidates in the central region of the galaxy. Later infrared observations from telescopes on the ground also found a population of bright globular cluster candidates.
Group membership.
Maffei 1 is a principal member of a nearby group of galaxies. The group's other members are the giant spiral galaxies IC 342 and Maffei 2. Maffei 1 has also a small satellite spiral galaxy Dwingeloo 1 as well as a number of dwarf satellites like MB1. The Group is one the closest galaxy groups to the Milky Way galaxy.

Marian Dobmayer (born 24 October 1753, at Schwandorf, Bavaria; died 21 December 1805, at Amberg, Bavaria) was a German Benedictine theologian.
Life.
He first entered the Society of Jesus, and after its suppression in 1773 joined the Benedictines in the monastery of Weissenohe, Diocese of Bamberg. There he was professed in 1775, and in 1778 ordained priest. 
He was successively professor of philosophy at Neuberg, Bavaria (1781–87), of dogmatic theology and ecclesiastical history at Amberg (1787–94), and of dogmatic theology and patrology at the University of Ingolstadt (1794–99). On the reorganization of the latter school in 1799 he returned his monastery of Weissenohe, where he remained until its secularization. He them retired to Amberg, where he taught theology until his death. 
Works.
In 1789 he published at Amberg a "Conspectus Theologiæ Dogmaticæ". His chief work is the "Systema Theologiæ Catholicæ", edited after his death by Th. P. Senestrey in eight volumes (Sulzbach, 1807–19). The work is learned and moderate in its controversial parts.

Angélique, Marquise des Anges

Angélique, Marquise des Anges is a French 1964 film, based on the novel of the same name by Anne and Serge Golon.
Synopsis.
In Mid-17th century France: young Louis XIV is struggling for his throne, beggars and thieves haunt Paris and brigands roam the countryside. Fifth child of an impoverished country nobleman, Angélique de Sancé de Monteloup grows up in the Poitou marshlands. Her logical destiny would be to marry a poor country nobleman, have children and spend her life fighting for a meagre subsistence. Destiny has other plans in store for her. At 17, on returning from her education in a convent, she finds herself betrothed to the rich count Jeoffrey de Peyrac (Jeoffrey Comte de Peyrac de Morens, Lord of Toulouse), 12 years her senior, lame, scarred and reputed to be a wizard. For the sake of her family, Angélique reluctantly agrees to the match but refuses the advances of her husband. Peyrac respects her decision and does not pursue his claim to conjugal rights, wishing rather to seduce than use force.
With the passing of months, Angelique discovers the talents and virtues of her remarkable husband: scientist, musician, philosopher; and to her surprise falls passionately in love with him. But Jeoffrey's unusual way of life is threatened by the ambitions of the Archbishop of Toulouse, and soon arouses the jealousy of the young king himself, Louis XIV. Joffrey is arrested and charged with sorcery. Angélique will single-handedly take on the might of the royal court and, survive murder and poison attempts on herself in a supreme effort to save Joffrey from the stake, to no avail. Instinctively, her whole being intent on revenge and her determination to survive, Angélique, alone and desperate, plunges into the darkness of the Paris underworld.

Herbert Baker (screenwriter)

Herbert Baker born Herbert Abrahams (25 December 1920, New York City - 30 June 1983, Encino, California) was a songwriter and screenwriter for television and films.
Biography.
The only son of composer Maurice Abrahams and singer Belle Baker, Herbert attended Yale School of Drama receiving a Bachelor of Arts. It was no surprise that Herbert would enter the musical field. His first Broadway credit was in 1944 as the lyricist of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's arrangement of Offenbach's "La Belle Helene" as well as other songs and musical pieces for "Helen Goes to Troy" that ran for 97 performances.
Screenwriting.
In 1945, Baker wrote for the Danny Kaye radio show. Henry Morgan hired Baker to write for his radio show in 1947. Baker began his career in screenwriting in 1948 with Morgan's film debut "So This Is New York", co-written with Carl Foreman and based upon Ring Lardner's 1920 novel "The Big Town". Baker was a Yale classmate of director Richard Fleischer and recommended him to Stanley Kramer for "So This Is New York". 
He wrote "Dream Wife" (1953) with Sidney Sheldon for Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr and several films for Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis such as "Jumping Jacks" (1951), "Scared Stiff" (1953), and "Artists and Models" (1955). The latter film was directed and co-written by Frank Tashlin whom Baker worked with again on "The Girl Can't Help It". 
Baker kept writing songs and contributed new songs to the "Rose Marie" (1954).
He wrote two films for Elvis Presley, "Loving You" and "King Creole". After Martin and Lewis split up, Baker wrote "Don't Give Up the Ship" for Jerry Lewis and worked on Lewis's television show.
Baker entered television writing and won Emmy Awards for "An Evening With Fred Astaire" in 1959 and "The Flip Wilson Show" in 1971. He was nominated twice for "The Flip Wilson Show" in 1972 and 1973 and was nominated in 1964 for "The Danny Kaye Show". Baker wrote television scripts for many other singers such as Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, John Denver, Ted Knight, Mac Davis and Gladys Knight and the Pips. Baker also wrote a television pilot for a version of "Some Like It Hot" in 1961.
In 1965, Baker wrote for "The Dean Martin Show". When Martin agreed to star in and co-produce a series of Matt Helm films for producer Irving Allen in the same year, Baker rewrote Oscar Saul's screenplay for the third and final draft of "The Silencers" but only received a screen credit for the song parodies he wrote for Martin. Baker received sole credit for "Murderers' Row" that Saul had rewritten but Baker rewrote again. Baker then wrote the third Matt Helm film "The Ambushers" but wrote a serious spy adventure for Irving Allen, "Hammerhead" based on James Mayo's Charles Hood character. 
His final screen credit was "The Jazz Singer" in 1980.
Baker taught music and mentored jazz saxophonist Azar Lawrence who recalled Baker as "one of the greatest pianists who ever lived" and taught Lawrence to reach down inside himself for his music.
A member of the Writers Guild of America, west board, Baker was awarded the "Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award" from the guild in 1983.

Biography.
Early life and education.
Kim Hyun-Joong family consists of his parents and an older brother. He was born on June 6, 1986 in Seoul, South Korea.
During his school days, Kim played bass guitar in a band. However, he dropped out of school when he decided to become a singer. After SS501's debut, nevertheless, Kim returned to school and graduated in 2006.
In 2011, Kim enrolled in Chungwoon University to study stage production management. He, then, enrolled into Kongju Communication Arts (KCAU) to study applied music in February 2012.
Pre-debut.
Initially he was to debut in a five-member group, of which Han Yeon of B2Y (now disbanded) was to be the leader and Kim the youngest member. During 2001 and 2002, while working as a waiter in a family restaurant located at Jamsil-dong, Kim was introduced to a new set up management company CEO. While the group underwent training together, they were asked by their company to debut in China as a Hallyu project group, but they rejected the offer and disbanded. Kim proceeded to audition for DSP Media (formerly DSP Entertainment) and became a member and the leader of SS501.
2005-08: Debut with SS501 and "We Got Married".
Kim Hyun Joong made his entertainment debut as the leader of SS501 on June 8, 2005, along with their debut album entitled "Warning". Their second mini album, "Snow Prince" was released in late 2005, five months after their debut. During this time, they also established their official fan club name, "Triple S", and fan club color, pearl green.
The group earned popularity right away as they won many rookie awards after debut. In fact, SS501 has had their first variety show, "SS501 M!Pick" by MNET, documenting their pre-debut days and three months after their debut. At the same time, SS501 also appeared on the 2006 show "Thank You For Waking Me Up", which proved Kim to be a heavy sleeper.
SS501 soon promoted their first studio album, which was released on November 10 entitled "S.T 01 Now". At the same time, SS501 also gained popularity in Japan one year later in 2007, having their own variety shows and learning Japanese language to capture the hearts of Japanese fans. A Japanese fan club was established with the name "Triple S Japan", which officially debuted on March 25, 2007, when SS501 had their first official meeting with the club. The group at this time released several albums which includes "Kokoro", "Distance", and their self-titled full album, "SS501". SS501 also received the "Newcomer Award" by Japan Gold Disc Award in January 2008; this was the first time for Korean artists to receive this award.
Simultaneously, SS501 became active both in Korea and Japan, releasing "Deja Vu", and "Lucky Days" albums.
In May 2008, Kim joined the cast of "We Got Married" along with Hwangbo in episode 9. Known as the "Lettuce Couple", they won MBC's "Best Couple Award". The couple made their official exit from the show in episode 38, on December 14, 2008 due to scheduling conflicts with "Boys Over Flowers".
2009-10: "Boys Over Flowers", leaving DSP Media, and "Playful Kiss".
While working in Japan in 2008, Kim was cast for his first lead-acting role as Yoon Ji-hoo in the Korean drama "Boys Over Flowers", a role for which he won the "Best Actor Award" at the "Seoul International Drama Awards 2009" and the "Popularity Award" at the "45th PaekSang Arts Awards". Because of his drama work, Kim, along with his bandmate Park Jung-min, who starred in a musical at the time, were absent for SS501's "U R Man" album, which the three remaining SS501 members promoted by themselves, with the exception of some special performances that included all five band members.
After SS501 released "All My Love", "Solo Collection", and "Rebirth" in September 2009, Kim was diagnosed with H1N1 during promotional activities in Yokohama, Japan for "Boys Over Flowers". He was treated in a Tokyo hospital and was discharged on September 15, 2009. While recovering from H1N1, he could not attend the "Seoul International Drama Awards"; so his SS501 band mates, Heo Young-saeng, Kim Kyu-jong and Kim Hyung-jun accepted the award on his behalf.
Kim became a spokesperson for cosmetics brand Tony Moly, an established company with numerous branches all across Asia, including Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, but ended his contract with Tony Moly at the end of September 2010 and continued to be the spokesperson for another cosmetics brand, The Face Shop.
In May 2010, SS501 released their last album before their contracts ended entitled "Destination", produced by Steven Lee.

Nine days later, the news that Kim had officially left DSP Media and joined Bae Yong-joon's KeyEast Entertainment company was announced.
Kim played the leading role of Baek Seung-jo in the drama "Playful Kiss", a Korean adaptation of the Japanese shōjo manga "Itazura na Kiss". Baek Seung-jo is an all around perfect genius with an IQ of 200, who ends up falling in love with Oh Ha-ni, played by Jung So-min. Because of the drama's success in Korea, "Playful Kiss" was broadcast in China and on November 7, its leading male actor, Kim, was interviewed by CNN's Anna Coren. On October 11, Playful Kiss opened its official YouTube Channel account for the series' Special Edition promotional video and it attracted many viewers.

On May 23, Kim's "First Impact" concert DVD sold 16,000 copies in its first week of release, taking the number one spot for the Overall DVD Chart. This is the first time a Korean artist has taken the number one spot, and a second time a foreign artist has taken the number one spot on the charts, the first being Michael Jackson, with his 2011 DVD.
From May to July, Kim held his "Kim Hyun Joong Fan Meeting Tour 2012", making stops in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Thailand.
The singer, who had mostly focused on promoting his albums after his second drama "Playful Kiss" had come to an end in 2010, was cast for the upcoming drama "City Conquest", which will air in late 2012 / early 2013. Kim Hyun-joong will portray the main character of Baek Mir in "City Conquest", a wild and strong man, who experienced many hardships and difficulties throughout his life, e.g. growing up without his parents.

On October 4, 2012, Kim announced at an event to promote "City Conquest" and to celebrate his Japanese fanclub "Henecia Japan"'s first anniversary, that he would release his first full length studio album in Japan in December.

On the other hand, his Unlimited album has been certified "Gold" by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (‘RIAJ’) after selling more than 100,000 units to retailers.
In February, it was rumored that City Conquest has been rejected by KBS for the reason that it "lacked in quality". The producers of the drama, however, argued that KBS decided not to air it even after following KBS's requirements and requests, without any words of apology or explanation to the producers and fans. Instead, the team accused KBS of having political reasons for pulling out the drama. Then, again, KBS asserted that those claims were all false and will take strict actions against the producers. After some time, it was announced that Kim Hyun Joong will be withdrawing from the drama and is planning to start in another drama later this year instead. For now, he started his promotions as a singer with his Japan and world tour.

The other members of SS501 celebrated their eight anniversary together with a video greeting message to celebrate and greet their fans, wherein they posted it on their YouTube accounts individually at the same day.

By the end of the month, Kim exited Barefooted Friends due to his new KBS drama, Inspiring Generation, which started filming in November in China. The action drama, depicting the story of love and friendship of ‘fighters’ from Korea, Japan and China, received much attention from the Asia market (including "Ray & Mo" production company, America, and Thailand) prior to its airing.

With his professorial duties was connected the regency of the seminary and, after declining an offer to succeed his confrère, Bede Aschenbrenner, as professor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt in 1793; he was also appointed rector of the school at Amberg in 1794. Upon his request he was relieved of the rectorship in 1798 and, after refusing another offer as professor of canon law at Aschaffenburg in 1804; he was honored with the title of spiritual councillor of the king. Owing to ill-health he resigned the regency of the seminary and after 1808 he taught only canon law and pastoral theology.
Works.
He was esteemed as a theologian and canonist, and his works were used as texts in many institutions of Germany and Austria. His chief works are

Mount Saint Mary's Convent and Academy

Mount Saint Mary's Convent and Academy, originally the Sacred Heart Convent and Holy Angels Orphanage and previously Mount St. Mary’s Convent and Orphan Asylum, and also known as Mount Saint Mary's Academy and Convent, is the only extant original orphanage in California and commemorates the Sisters of Mercy, in Grass Valley, Nevada County, California.
The Gothic Revival Style Victorian building with Georgian Revival accents currently houses the Grass Valley Museum, at 410 South Church Street between Chapel and Dalton Streets, Grass Valley.
History.
Katherine Russell (sister of Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen and better known as Mother Mary Baptist Russell, or simply "Mother Baptist") arrived in San Francisco with seven other Sisters of Mercy on 1854-12-08 from Kinsale, County Cork, Ireland; other Sisters followed. On 1863-08-20, spearheaded by vicar-general Father Thomas Dalton, five Sisters, including Mother Baptist, arrived in Grass Valley to help the California Gold Rush miners' orphans. Bishop Eugene O’Connell placed the cornerstone for the convent/orphanage building on Sunday, 1865-05-02. The Sisters moved in on 1866-03-20, and the first orphans were taken in on 1866-04-02.
The orphanage closed in 1932 and the facility was de-sanctified in 1968. The following year, in 1969, the Grass Valley Historic Preservation Committee began repair and preservation of the building and the Sisters' rose garden. The Foley Library for Historical Research in nearby Nevada City, California retains historical documents for Mount St. Mary's.
Construction.
The building is three-stories, and was built at a cost of $19,856, including construction and interior furnishings.
Landmark designation.
This Nevada County building is honored as a National Register of Historic Places and California Historical Landmark No. 855, registered in 1972-04-24. The plaque's inscription states:
Mount Saint Mary's Convent and Academy
Built by Reverend Thomas J. Dalton, the Sacred Heart Convent and Holy Angels Orphanage was dedicated May 2, 1865 by Bishop Eugene O'Connell. Under the Sisters of Mercy, it served from 1866 to 1932 as the first orphanage of the Northern Mines. It functioned as an academy from 1868 to 1965 and as a convent from 1866 to 1968.
The plaque was placed on the building 1972-10-28 by the California Department of Parks and Recreation.

Speaking Circles

Speaking Circles are small groups of 8-10 people who come together to feel at ease in public speaking. Originally developed as a way to combat stage fright, independent practitioners now also report successful applications to treating stuttering, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and other social challenges.
History.
Speaking Circles was developed in the late 1970s by former stand-up comedian Lee Glickstein, who codified the methods he found successful in addressing his own experience of stage fright. Subsequently, Glickstein registered the name Speaking Circles as a trademark and incorporated a business, Speaking Circles International, to deliver training using his methods through a network of licensed facilitators. The Speaking Circles website now lists over 50 facilitators who have paid for initial training and ongoing certification and who now operate their own practices across the United States, Belgium, Canada, England, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Mexico and Japan.
Relational presence.
The core of Glickstein's method is a state of mind he calls "Relational Presence", something he describes as "a state of receptivity to another without agenda or effort."
Traditional oratory and rhetorical approaches to public speaking highlight performance as a key to engaging and holding an audience. Metaphorically, speakers are seen as connecting with their audiences by 'reaching out' to them through compelling words, gestures and arguments.
In contrast, speakers applying Relational Presence techniques invite connection by establishing a sense of intimate safety. The speaker and each audience member understand that it's OK to simply be themselves and no performance is required.
Training methods.
Licensed facilitators teach Relational Presence through an approach sharing elements in common with group psychotherapy. It aims to gradually repair the damage left behind from any earlier public traumas in life.

Nachiyar Koil

Nachiar Kovil or Thirunarayur Nambi Temple in Thirunarayur, a village in the outskirts of Kumbakonam in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the "Divya Prabandha", the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th to 9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 "Divyadesam" dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Srinivasa Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Nachiyar. The temple is the place where god Vishnu is believed to have initiated "Pancha Samskara" (religious initiation) to Thirmangai Azhwar.
The temple is believed to have been built by Kochengat Cholan of the late 3rd century AD, with later contributions from Medieval Cholas and Vijayanagar kings. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines, while it has a 5-tiered "rajagopuram", the temple's gateway tower. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
Srinivasa is believed to have appeared to sage Medhavi and married his daughter at this temple, witnessed by Brahma and devas. Six daily rituals and four yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam, celebrated during the Tamil month of "Margazhi" (December–January), is the most prominent. The Kal Garuda image in the temple used during the festive occasions is believed to increase in weight seeking 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 people in succession when the procession comes out of various gates from the sanctum to the main entrance of the temple.
Legend.
As per Hindu legend, sage Medhavi was doing penance at this place. While taking a bath in the river, he found an image of Chakrathazhwar entwined with Yoga Narasimha. A divine voice asked him to install the image in his hermitage and worship it. Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu chose to grow in the hermitage and appeared to the sage in the form of a small girl and requested him to take care of her. Vishnu traveled in search of Lakshmi in his vehicle Garuda, the eagle. Garuda found the presence of Lakshmi in the hermitage. Vishnu appeared to sage Medhavi, pleased by the latter's devotion to him and asked his daughter to be married to him. The sage happily married Lakshmi to Vishnu and requested him to stay in his place, which Vishnu accepted.
The Temple.
The temple is believed to have been built by Ko Chenkannan, the Chola King. He is believed to have built 70 temples dedicated to Shiva and Thirunaraiyur is the only Vishnu temple constructed by him. The temple has a 5-tiered "rajagopuram" on the eastern side, raising up to a height of . The entrance through the eastern gateway leads to a hall of 16 pillars, called Neenila Mutram. The centre of the hall is occupied by "Dwajasthamba" (the flag pole) and "Balipeeda" (the place of sacrifice), one behind the other. The front portion of the flag pole has a small shrine for Garuda. The flag pole, place of sacrifice and Garuda's shrine are in axial position from the entrance to the main sanctum. The shrine of Thirumangai Azhwar is located on the northern side. The central hall of the temple, the Goratha Mandapam, houses the images of Ramanuja, Koorathazhwar and idols of eleven azhwars, leaving that of Andal.
The southern side of the temple has a garden where the Vilva tree, the "Sthala Vriksha" (temple tree) is present. The Vasantha Mandapa or the spring hall is located next to it, which hosts the Vasanthothsavam or spring festival during the Tamil month of "Vaikasi" (May–June). The temple also has a 100-pillared hall where the wedding festival is held during the Tamil month of "Aavani"(September–October). There is a separate shrine in the north that houses images of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita and another shrine in the south that houses the image of Hanuman. There is a shrine for Chakrathazhwar and Yoga Narasimha, believed to have been installed and worshipped by sage Medhavi. The first precinct has separate shrines for Manavala Maamuni and Nigamantha Maha Desikan and idols of the utsava deities (festive images) of the 108 "divyadesams".
The temple has an elevated structure approached through a flight of 21 steps. The presiding deity of the temple is Vishnu in the form of Narayur Nambi and his consort Lakshmi as Vanchulavalli Thaayaar (also called Neela Devi Nachiyar), both of whom are housed in the main sanctum. Unlike other Vishnu temples where Vishnu is given importance, in this temple Nachiyar (Thayar) is prominent. The sanctum also houses the images of Brahma, Pradyumnan, Aniruddhan, Sankarshanan and Purushothaman and a set of devas who are depicted attending the wedding. The festive idols of Srinivasa, Sridevi, Vanjulavalli and Bhoodevi are housed in the same shrine. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
Kal Garudar.
Kal Garudar is the most prominent feature of the temple. As per local legend, the sculptor who sculpted the idol of Garuda got frustrated as the bird flew away each time a new image was prepared. In frustration, he threw a stone at Garuda, who got injured and decided to stay in the temple as Kal Garuda. The image of Kal Garuda is made of saligrama and is housed in the shrine outside the main sanctum. During festive procession during the Tamil months of "Margazhi" (December–January) and Panguni (April - May), the festive images are carried out in procession in Kal Garudar. While only four people are needed to carry the idol of Garuda out of the shrine, it multiples to 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 people when the image is taken outside the temple. On the way back only 4 people are required to carry the float. The aspect is treated magical as drops of sweat are also observed on the image of Kal Garuda during the six hour long procession. During the festive occasion, Garuda receives honors from Srinivasa Perumal in the form of dress and ornaments. Jewels and dress are also presented to Garuda by Ranganathar, the presiding deity of Srirangam Ranganthaswamy Temple.
Festivals and religious practices.
The temple priests perform the "pooja" (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: "Ushathkalam" at 7 a.m., "Kalasanthi" at 8:00 a.m., "Uchikalam" at 12:00 p.m., "Sayarakshai" at 6:00 p.m., "Irandamkalam" at 7:00 p.m. and "Ardha Jamam" at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: "alangaram" (decoration), "neivethanam" (food offering) and "deepa aradanai" (waving of lamps) for both Srinivasa and Nachiyar. During the last step of worship, "nagaswaram" (pipe instrument) and "tavil" (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the "Vedas" (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.
The prime festival or Brahmmotsavam is a 10-day festival celebrated during the Tamil month of "Margazhi" (December–January). Garuda Sevai is celebrated during the Tamil month of "Panguni" (March–April). During both these festivals, the festive images are taken out in Kal Garuda around the streets of the temple. Vasanthothsavam or spring festival is celebrated during the Tamil month of "Vaikasi" (May–June). The Thirukalyana Utsavam or the wedding fstival is celebrated in the 100-pillared hall during the Tamil month of "Aavani"(September–October).
Religious significance.
The temple is revered in "Nalayira Divya Prabandham", the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar in hundred hymns. It is the second temple revered by Thirumangai having more than hundred verses, the first one being the Neelamegha Perumal Temple at Thirukannapuram. Thirumangai compares Srinivasa Perumal of the temple with Venkatachalapathy at Tirupathi and believes that he found the same beauty in both of the them. It is also believed that when Thirumangai was asked to present a "madal" (ballad) by Ranganathar of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple, Thirumangai replied that he built the walls in Srirangam, while he built the verses for Thirunaraiyur.
The temple is classified as a "Divyadesam", one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The temple is the place where god Vishnu is believed to have initiated "Pancha Samskara" (religious initiation) to Thirmangai. The temple is also quoted as a Siddhi Kshetra, a sacred place where sages attain earthly liberation. The place is considered sacred on account of being the hermitage of sage Medhavi. In Vaishanava theology, Varadaraja Perumal Temple at Kanchipuram is referred as Athigiri and Tirumala Venkateswara Temple at Tirupathi as Seshagiri and the temple at Thirunaraiyur is referred as Suganthagiri.
Naachiyar Koil is one of the few "Divyadesams" where the goddess has prominence over Vishnu. Some of the other temples where the such female dominance are observed are Andal Temple at Srivilliputhur, Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Temple at Woraiyur and Pundarikakshan Perumal Temple in Thiruvellarai. While Srivilliputhur is called Naachiyaar Thiru Maaligai, Thirunaraiyur is called Nachiyar Koil.
Vishnu was of the view that during Kali Yuga, men would have to listen to women. Hence he decided that he would first set an example and listen to goddess here. During all festive occasions, the first rights are reserved for Nachiyar, who moves ahead, while Srinivasa follows her. Even the food is first served to Nachiyar and then to Srinivasa. Being a temple where goddess has prominence, Vishnu is located slightly by the side and goddess has the prominent position inside the sanctum.

All Saints, Burton upon Trent

All Saints is a Church of England parish church situated in Burton upon Trent. It is part of the Diocese of Lichfield.
History.
The church was opened in 1905, designed by the architects Naylor and Sale of Derby.
All Saints' church (...) is executed in an Arts and Crafts Gothic style and has a grey, rock-faced exterior of Coxbench and Weldon stone and an interior of buff sandstone with pink Hollington stone dressings. It consists of a chancel with clergy and choir vestries to the north and organ chamber to the south, a nave with north and south aisles, a north-western tower above a porch, and a second, south-west porch linked by a narthex with a baptistry apse. (fn. 19) The nave, aisles, chancel, and chancel arch are very wide, and the five-bay arcades have octagonal piers and moulded capitals. The nave and chancel windows are in Arts and Crafts Decorated style, while those in the clerestory and in the tower are in Arts and Crafts Perpendicular. Only the east window has coloured glass. The nave has a modified hammer-beam roof with tiebeams and kingposts.
The church retains virtually all its Arts and Crafts Gothic furnishings, including an ambo formed by a low serpentine marble cancelli screen with a pulpit and reading desk at either end, choir stalls, organ case, font, and some pews. The chancel floor is of inlaid white, green, and red marble.
The west end of the nave was screened off to make a parish room in 1982 by Duvall, Brownhill of Lichfield, using timber taken from the pews formerly at the west end of the nave, and the font was moved from its original position at the west end of the nave to the east end of the south aisle.
A single bell was placed in the tower in 1905. The tower, however, was designed to accommodate a peal of eight bells, and in 1947 a 'victory peal' of five additional bells, donated by Sir William Bass and others, was installed as a war memorial. 
Organ.
The church had a pipe organ installed by the builder Peter Conacher. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

<doc id="18629900" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18629900" title="SWEAT (hypothesis)">
SWEAT (hypothesis)

SWEAT stands for southwestern United States and East Antarctica, which theorizes that the Southwestern United States was at one time connected to East Antarctica.
A hypothesis for a late Precambrian fit of western North America with the Australia-Antarctic shield region permits the extension of many features through Antarctica and into other parts of Gondwana, specifically, the Grenville orogen may extend around the coast of East Antarctica into India and Australia. The ophiolitic belt of the latter may extend into East Antarctica. The Wopmay orogen of northwest Canada may extend through eastern Australia into Antarctica and thence beneath the ice to connect with the Yavapai-Mazatzal orogens of the southwestern United States. Counterparts of the Precambrian-Paleozoic sedimentary rocks along the U.S. Cordilleran miogeocline may be present in the Transantarctic Mountains. Orogenic belt boundaries provide useful piercing points for Precambrian continental reconstructions. The model implies that Gondwana and Laurentia drifted away from each other on one margin and collided some 300 million years later on their opposite margins to form the Appalachians.
Evidence.
A paper published by an international team led by John Goodge, an NSF-funded researcher with the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, gives significant support to the theory.
Writing in the July 11 edition of the journal Science, this international team of U.S. and Australian investigators describe their findings, which were made in the Transantarctic Mountains, and their significance to the problem of piecing together what an ancient supercontinent, called Rodinia, looked like. The U.S. investigators were funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).
Previous lines of scientific evidence led researchers to theorize that about 600-800 million years ago a portion of Rodinia broke away from what is now the southwestern United States and eventually drifted southward to become eastern Antarctica and Australia.
They argue that the team's find provides physical evidence that confirms the southwestern United States and East Antarctica (SWEAT) hypothesis.
John Goodge's team was searching in Antarctica's Transantarctic Mountains for rocks carried along by ice rivers that could provide clues to the composition of the underlying crust of Antarctica, which in most places is buried under 2 miles of ice. One rock, found atop the so-called Nimrod Glacier, was later determined to be a very specific form of granite which has a particular type of coarse-grained texture. Chemical tests run on the rock revealed that it has a chemistry very similar to a unique belt of igneous rocks in North America that stretch from California through New Mexico to Kansas, Illinois and eventually New Brunswick and Newfoundland in Canada.
This belt of rock was a part of what is called Laurentia, thought by some geologists to be the core of Rodinia.This belt stops suddenly at its western margin, leading geologists to suspect that some piece of crust had rifted away from what is now the West Coast of the United States.
East Antarctica–Laurentia Juxtaposition.
The positions of Laurentia and other landmasses in the Precambrian super continent of Rodinia are controversial. Although geological and isotopic data support an East Antarctic fit with western Laurentia, alternative reconstructions favor the juxtaposition of Australia, Siberia, or South China. New geologic, age, and isotopic data provide a positive test of the juxtaposition with East Antarctica: Neodymium isotopes of Neoproterozoic rift-margin strata are similar; hafnium isotopes of about 1.4 billion year old Antarctic-margin detrital zircons match those in Laurentian granites of similar age; and a glacial clast of A-type granite has a uranium-lead zircon age of ~1440 million years, an epsilon-hafnium initial value of +7, and an epsilon-neodymium initial value of +4. These tracers indicate the presence of granites in East Antarctica having the same age, geochemical properties, and isotopic signatures as the distinctive granites in Laurentia.

Joseph Morewood Staniforth

Joseph Morewood Staniforth (better known as J.M. Staniforth) (1863 - 21 December 1921) was a Welsh editorial cartoonist best known for his work in the Western Mail, Evening Express and Sunday weekly the News of the World. Staniforth has been described as '...the most important visual commentator on Welsh affairs ever to work in the country.'
Life history.
Born in Gloucester in 1863, the son of a tool repairer. His family moved to Cardiff in South Wales in 1870, and after leaving school at 15, Staniforth trained as a lithographic printer for the Western Mail before becoming an art reviewer. He started publishing cartoons in 1889 after being spotted by the paper's editor Henry Lascelles Carr.
Usually published in the Western Mail, Staniforth's drawings and cartoons covered political and social unrest in Wales from 1890 through to the First World War. Although his cartoons followed editorial lines, with editor Carr appearing in several stating his own opinion, Staniforth himself veered more towards the more tolerant Liberal-Labour movement and would attack both capitalist coal owners and the socialist unions.
In 1911 Staniforth was commissioned, by then Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George to produce a piece of artwork to commemorate the investiture of Prince Edward as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle. The artwork, in pencil and watercolour, was kept by Lloyd George who hung it in his study.
Dame Wales.
One of Staniforth's more famous creations was 'Dame Wales' (or Mam Cymru), a middle-aged woman dressed in the Welsh national costume, along with Welsh hat, who would embody Wales in a similar way that other cartoonists would use Britannia to symbolise Britain or the British Empire. Dame Wales was normally the voice of reason in Staniforth's cartoons and is often pictured attempting to discourage others from making decisions that would damage the country. When a spoken caption was required, Dame Wales would often be depicted talking in a working class valleys vernacular, which stands out against the language used by the more educated figures of authority she challenges. Other cartoonists would later take up the figure of Dame Wales, and would keep the same image in their work.

Gatayeva and her children were one of the subject of the 2005 documentary film "The 3 Rooms of Melancholia" ("Melancholian 3 huonetta") by Pirjo Honkasalo, who kept in contact with her ever since. Hadijat is also the titular "angel" in the 2008 book "" by Åsne Seierstad.
Biography.
Gatayeva, who had served as a young field nurse for the separatist forces in the First Chechen War, opened-up a makeshift orphanage for street children in 1996. After the beginning of the Second Chechen War in 1999, for a period of time she had operated her orphanage in a refugee camp in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia; she was forced to return to destroyed Grozny after electricity and water were cut off from the camp after the ascent of Murat Zyazikov in 2002.
Eventually, she moved from Russia to Kaunas in Lithuania. On October 16, 2008, Gatayeva reportedly went "missing" after she and her husband were arrested by the Lithuanian security police in Kaunas on unspecified charges.
On January 7, 2010, Gatayeva and her husband were arrested by Finnish police. The arrest was based on European Arrest Warrant from Lithuania. Before the arrest Gatayeva and her husband had applied for political asylum in Finland. The asylum against the political persecution by Lithuanian authorities was granted in May 2012.

The solo tracks featured on the three limited editions are "w/o notice??" (sung by Kazuya Kamenashi), "" (Junnosuke Taguchi), "LOVEJUICE" (Jin Akanishi), "PARASITE" (Koki Tanaka), "" (Tatsuya Ueda) and "SMACK" (Yuichi Nakamaru).
Release and promotion.
KAT-TUN performed the song on television for the first time on "Music Station" on April 25, 2008 and again on May 2, 2008. The group returned to the show on May 16 to sing it for the third time as part of a medley which included each of their respective solo songs. On May 11, Taguchi and Ueda appeared and performed the song on their kōhai Hey! Say! JUMP's variety show, "Hi! Hey! Say", while Tanaka was a guest performer on HSJ's other show, "Show wa Hey! Say!", the day after. All three rejoined the rest of the group on May 12 to perform on Fuji TV's "Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ". Two days later, the band debuted the song on their own show, "Cartoon KAT-TUN"—the same day the single was released in Japan. On May 15, KAT-TUN made their fourth appearance on SMAP member Masahiro Nakai's "Utaban" and a day later, sang on "Shōnen Club Premium".
Chart performance.
In its first week of release, the single reportedly sold over 381,672 copies and knocked off NEWS' "Summer Time" from the top spot on Oricon's singles chart. It also debuted at number 1 on Billboard's Japan Hot 100. The song's total reported sales currently stand at 447,971 copies. The song was the second best-selling single for the first half of 2008 behind Thelma Aoyama's "Soba ni Iru ne" and later ranked as the eighth bestselling single of the year by Oricon and was later certified Platinum by RIAJ denoting over 250,000 shipments.
The song was honored at the 23rd Japan Gold Disc Awards when it placed on the "Best 10 Music Singles (Domestic)" list alongside "Lips".

DRG Class 81

The locomotives of the German DRG Class 81 were standard ("Einheitsdampflokomotiven") goods train tank locomotives with the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG).
In 1928, ten examples were delivered by the firm of Hanomag that matched the Class 80 locomotives in many details. The axles were all fixed rigidly to the frame, but the middle one had thinner wheel flanges. In contrast to the Class 80s, the Class 81 engines had a larger heating area and carried more coal and water. The delivery of 60 more vehicles was cancelled in 1940 due to the Second World War. The locomotives were mainly employed on heavy shunting duties. After their collection, the ten engines were allocated to the locomotive depots ("Bahnbetriebswerken" or "Bw") of Goslar (81 001–005) and Oldenburg (81 006–010). In 1945 all the engines were in the Oldenburg area and went over to the Deutsche Bundesbahn. The last engine was taken out of service in October 1963. Number 81 005 was still working as an industrial loco in AW Nied after its retirement from the DB.
Preserved Locomotives.
Number 81 004 is the only one of its type to have been preserved. After passing through several owners and locations, it has found a home with the "Hessencourrier" society, who intend to have it refurbished.

Shairi

Shairi (Georgian: შაირი, ), also known as "Rustavelian Quatrain", is a monorhymed quatrain used by Shota Rustaveli in the Knight in the Panther's Skin.
It consists of four 16-syllable lines, with a caesura between syllables eight and nine. While there are stanzas with as many as five syllables rhyming, generally shairi uses either feminine or dactylic rhyme. It is worth noticing that despite the feminine and dactylic forms of rhyme, in Georgian shairi stress is very weak due to the nature of the Georgian language, which is characterized by dynamic and very weak stress placed on antepenultimate syllable in words longer than two syllables and on penultimate in two syllable words.
Types.
Two distinct forms of shairi exist: Magali (high) Shairi and Dabali (low) Shairi. Rustaveli used both types in his poem.
Maghali Shairi.
In Maghali Shairi, lines are broken into four sections of four syllables, with a caesura after the second section: xxxx xxxx//xxxx xxxx.
Dabali Shairi.
In Dabali Shairi, each line is broken into four segments of five and three syllables: xxxxx xxx//xxxxx xxx.

Broadway Barks

Broadway Barks is an annual animal charity event held in New York City to promote the adoption of shelter animals. Founded by Bernadette Peters and Mary Tyler Moore, the event has been held every July in Shubert Alley, starting in 1999. Performers, many from Broadway shows, present adoptable cats and dogs, with the participation of many animal groups from the New York City area.
Background.
The event was founded in 1999 by Bernadette Peters with Mary Tyler Moore and others, who wanted to do "something for the animals" after a successful fund–raising campaign for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. Performers, many appearing in Broadway shows, and other celebrities present cats and dogs from New York City and vicinity animal shelters for adoption.
Peters received a special Tony Award in 2012, the Isabelle Stevenson Award for her work with Broadway Barks. On August 21, 2012, Peters and Moore received a dedicated "Ride of Fame" bus on Gray Line New York. This honor "recognizes and honors leading New Yorkers and iconic New York establishments, whom they Line identify as 'exemplary community figures and entities by bestowing a bus in their fleet to each dedicatee.' " The bus has a "custom decal" with Moore and Peters' likenesses as well as a Broadway Barks logo.
The Adopt-a-thon.
The event has been held every July since 1999 in Shubert Alley, the heart of the Broadway Theater District. The first adopt–a–thon was held on July 24, 1999, and benefitted five animal welfare shelters and groups: the ASPCA, Center for Animal Care & Control (CACC), Bide-a-Wee, Humane Society and North Shore Animal League. Celebrities such as Tom Wopat, Joel Grey, Andrea McArdle, and Edie Falco participated. During the July 2007 event, more than 100 pets were adopted, and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued a proclamation making July 14, 2007 "Broadway Barks Day" in New York City.
"Broadway Barks" has grown over the years until, by Broadway Barks 10 held on July 12, 2008, it benefitted some 25 animal adoption and welfare groups, with presenters such as Glenn Close, Phyllis Newman, Mario Lopez, and Nathan Lane introducing the adoptable animals. Broadway Barks 11 was held on July 11, 2009, with the participation of and to benefit 26 animal adoption and welfare groups, including the ASPCA, BARC, and Long Island Greyhound Rescue. Many celebrity presenters attended, including Elizabeth Ashley, Michael Cerveris, David Hyde Pierce, Audra McDonald and Michael Urie.
Broadway Barks 12 was held on July 10, 2010, and included the animal adoption and welfare groups ASPCA, BARC, Humane Society of New York and the North Shore Animal League. Included among the celebrity participants were John Dossett, Alexander Hanson, Sean Hayes, Jackie Hoffman, Karen Olivo, Katie Finneran, Tony Goldwyn, Ruthie Henshall, Hunter Ryan Herdlicka, Beth Leavel, Judy McLane, Jan Maxwell, Tony Shalhoub and Richard Thomas. In honor of the event, the lights of the Empire State Building were lit in pink, purple and yellow.
Broadway Barks 13 was held on July 9, 2011. Performers from many of the Broadway shows presentered the adoptable animals: Nina Arianda and Michael McGrath ("Born Yesterday"); Heidi Blickenstaff, Jackie Hoffman, Bebe Neuwirth and Brad Oscar ("The Addams Family"); Steel Burkhardt, Matt DeAngelis, Josh Lamon, Paris Remillard and Kacie Sheik ("Hair"); Kerry Butler, Linda Hart and Aaron Tveit ("Catch Me If You Can"); Bobby Cannavale, Elizabeth Rodriguez and Yul Vázquez ("The Motherf**ker With the Hat"); Reeve Carney, T.V. Carpio, Jennifer Damiano, Isabel Keating and Patrick Page ("Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"), Victoria Clark and Patina Miller ("Sister Act"), Paige Davis ("Boeing-Boeing"), Sutton Foster, Adam Godley, Joel Grey and John McMartin ("Anything Goes"), John Benjamin Hickey ("The Normal Heart"), Nikki M. James, Rory O'Malley and Andrew Rannells ("The Book of Mormon"), Beth Leavel ("Baby It's You"), Judy McLane ("Mamma Mia!"), Will Swenson ("Priscilla Queen of the Desert") and Bill Berloni, "trainer to Broadway’s four-legged stars and behavior consultant for the Humane Society of New York."
Broadway Barks 14 was held on July 14, 2012. In addition to the celebrity presentation of adoptable cats and dogs, Peters autographed a new Broadway Barks calendar. To acknowledge the event, Peters rang the NASDAQ closing bell on July 13, 2012.
There were some 27 animal shelters and adoption agencies that participated, including the ASPCA, Mid Atlantic Great Dane, and Urban Cat League. Broadway and television performers presented the adoptable animals, such as Nina Arianda, Joel Grey, Megan Hilty, Anjelica Huston, Steve Kazee, Audra McDonald, Bebe Neuwirth and Ben Vereen. Neuwirth jokingly remarked (in a newspaper article) "I’m the designated crazy cat lady." She has been at Broadway Barks every year to "help showcase the many cats available for adoption."
Broadway Barks 15 was held on July 13, 2013. Peters and Harvey Fierstein (substituting for Moore, who could not attend) co-hosted. Performers such as David Hyde Pierce, Sigourney Weaver, Andrew Rannells, Jane Lynch, and Billy Porter presented the adoptable animals. Among the 27 shelters represented were Bobbi and the Strays, City Critters, The Humane Society of New York, Husky House, KittyKind, Loving Touch Animal Center, Manhattan Valley Cat Rescue, Metropolitan Maltese Rescue, Mid-Atlantic Great Dane Rescue League, NY Pet-I-Care, Pet ResQ, P.L.U.T.O. Rescue (Pet Lovers United Together as One), Russell Refuge, SaveKitty Foundation, Sean Casey Animal Rescue, Stray from the Heart, Tigger Foundation and Urban Cat League.
Special benefit concert (2009).
Peters held a one-time-only concert, "A Special Concert for Broadway Barks Because Broadway Cares", at the Minskoff Theatre, New York City, on November 9, 2009 as a benefit for both Broadway Barks and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids. The concert raised an estimated $615,000 for the two charities.
Books and songs.
To promote the charity, Peters wrote a children's picture book, "Broadway Barks", with mixed-media collage illustrations by Liz Murphy. The book was released in 2008 by Blue Apple Books and is designed for ages four through eight. It reached #5 on the "New York Times" Children's Best Sellers: Picture Books list for the week of June 8, 2008. It tells the story of Douglas, an abandoned dog, as he follows a "pretty lady" (whose looks are similar to Peters) to a Broadway Barks pet adoption event in Shubert Alley in New York City. He takes his turn singing, but people laugh at him, hearing only barking. A girl named Isabelle understands that he is performing and adopts him, renaming him "Kramer."
The book is accompanied by a CD, which has the story and a lullaby being read and sung by Peters herself. The lullaby, "Kramer's Song", has music and lyrics written by Peters. Additionally, Kramer has a plush toy dog named after him; proceeds from sales of the toy go to the Broadway Barks charity.
The mixed-breed dog named Kramer, who Peters adopted from a shelter, and her goddaughter Isabelle were the inspirations for the characters in the book. The interactive book app for iPad was published, based on the book.
Peters has written a second children's book named after her other dog, Stella, titled "Stella is a Star", with illustrations again by Liz Murphy and including a CD with an original song, "Stella's Song," written and performed by Peters. Stella is a pit bull who would rather be a pig ballerina, but learns to accept herself. It was released in April 2010 by Blue Apple Books, with proceeds going to the Broadway Barks charity. The CD also contains Peters' narration of the book. Peters introduced the book with a reading (and also singing the song for Stella) at the L.A. Times Festival of Books, Los Angeles, California, on April 24, 2010. She also participated in New York City's Learning Leaders Great School Volunteer Week by reading the book to pupils at a local New York City school in May 2010.

Alex Birns

Alex Birns (February 21, 1907 – March 29, 1975), also known as "Shondor", was a notorious Jewish-American mobster and racketeer from Cleveland, Ohio who was once labeled as the city's "Public enemy No. 1" by the local newspapers. He was actively involved in a wide variety of racketeering and other organized crime related activities such as prostitution, theft, numbers, etc., from the days of Prohibition until his demise.
Biography.
Early life.
Alex Birns was born Alexander Birnstein in 1907 in the town of Lemes in a section of Austria-Hungary that went to Czechoslovakia under the Versailles treaty. His parents were Herman and Illon Birnstein. Youngest of three children, he was brought to New York at the age of one month. From New York City, the family moved to Cleveland, settling in the lower Woodland Avenue district.
Like many immigrant families, the Birnsteins Americanized their surname to Birns. Alexander's name was abbreviated to an English translation of Zander, but the Italian and Jewish neighbors took to calling the boy "Shondor" (as the Hungarian equivalent of "Alexander" is "Sándor", pronounced roughly as most Americans would pronounce "Shondor") and the name stuck. Like most families, the Birns family struggled to earn a living in the New World. Like many immigrants during Prohibition, they turned to bootlegging, taking in a small still from Cleveland Mafia boss Joe Lonardo to supplement their income and better provide for their children.
In November 1920, Birns' mother was tending to the 10-gallon still in their apartment, when a faulty gas connection caused an explosion. Her clothing caught fire and was engulfed in flames. She ran outside screaming, where a passing motorist helped extinguish the flames and drove her to the hospital. Horribly burned over 75% of her body, she died the next morning. Birns was 13 at the time of his mother's death. Birns was sheltered for a time in the old Jewish orphanage. He grew up, quickly taking a job as a newspaper boy during the tough Newspaper circulation wars. Later on, he lived with his grandmother.
As a student, Birns excelled at athletics, especially baseball and swimming. Birns dropped out of school after 10th grade in 1922, enlisting in the United States Navy in 1923, but being discharged six months later because he was underage.
Criminal career.
On the streets, he developed a reputation as a fierce fighter, proving himself quick with his fists in many fights with street thugs. It was at roughly this time that he changed his surname to Birns, to save his family from the embarrassment of his involvement with criminals.
It was after this that his major brushes with the law began. Birns was convicted of car theft in 1925, for which he served 18 months in the Mansfield Reformatory. He soon acquired an assault conviction in which Birns broke the jaw of a motorist who had taken too long to make his turn in front of Birns. With 18 arrests in a 12-year period, Birns was on his way to notoriety in northeast Ohio. During this period, he glowed in his fame and enjoyed the attention which he received from local law enforcement as well as fellow gangsters. He soon developed a knack for beating the charges.
In the same time period, he was successfully prosecuted only twice. At the age of 19, Birns was convicted of auto theft and served two years in prison. In 1933, he was convicted of bribery, served 60 days and paid a $500 fine. After six appearances in court, a prosecutor remarked, "It is time the court put away this man whose reputation is one of rampant criminality." At this time, Birns was only in his twenties.
Association with the Maxie Diamond gang.
Birns was soon recruited by Maxie Diamond, leader of the E. 55th street and Woodland Mob. Diamond was an associate of Teamster leader William Presser and was once referred to by the local newspapers as "Cleveland's Number One Racketeer". Birns became a ranking member of Diamond's gang during the battles for control of the city's dry cleaners and launderers.
In 1933, shortly after he hooked up with the Maxie Diamond gang, Diamond narrowly escaped death from gunfire by rival gangsters in what was called by the police, "a continuation of the city's dry cleaning racket war." Birns was among those picked up for questioning. He was released, but only after paying $2 for two overdue traffic tickets.
Later in the year, Birns was once again arrested by the police. In separate incidents in quick succession, two men were shot from the same passing car. Police called it "continuation of guerrilla warfare among policy game racketeers." They picked up Birns for interrogation along with five of his fellow henchmen." Birns and three others were charged with manslaughter but were acquitted. Four days later, Birns, along with co-defendant Yale Cohen and attorney Max Lesnick, were convicted of bribing a witness. It was, "The Plain Dealer" said, "one of the few cases on record in which men identified by police as 'gangsters' were convicted of anything." The judge sentenced them to 60 days in the Warrensville Workhouse.
While serving his sentence at the Warrensville Workhouse after being convicted for the bribery charges, Birns granted his first newspaper interview. Birns told the reporter that he was serving his time happily and enjoying the hard work. In the years to come, he became close to many of the city's newspaper reporters and could sometimes be found chatting with one over a cocktail. To them, he was an excellent source of news tips. He was soon labeled as "Cleveland's Public Enemy No. 1" by the local press.
The Rudy Duncan hit.
One of Birns's most serious arrests was for the 1934 murder of Rudy Duncan, a 36-year-old night club bouncer at Euclid Avenue Keystone club. Birns was sitting at Keystone with two of his fellow gang members when he arose to retrieve some cigars from his overcoat which he had checked in the coat room. Birns had misplaced his cheque and could not produce it when asked for it by the coatroom girl. The coatroom girl subsequently refused to give Birns access to his coat. Over her objections, Birns entered the coatroom, shoving her aside in the process, and retrieved some cigars from his coat. He then returned to the table, had two more drinks and smoked one cigar.
Meanwhile, the coatroom girl ran outside and summoned Rudy Duncan, the bouncer who also happened to be her live-in boyfriend. She told him about the incident with Birns. Duncan was a former boxer with arrests in Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and Cleveland, and had experienced previous run-ins with Birns and his gang.
Duncan came up behind him and in a menacing manner, demanded an explanation as to Birns's presence in the Club. Birns muttered something and the two lunged at each other. In the ensuing ruckus, two shots were fired. One hit Birns in the shoulder and the other hit one of Birns's friends in the leg. Duncan ordered Birns's crew out of the bar at gunpoint.
When the police arrived, they found Birns in his car ready to pull away, while holding a bloody handkerchief to his shoulder. They searched his car and confiscated a revolver which he had placed in his glovebox. He denied ownership of the gun and would not reveal who shot him. The police drove him to the hospital. After two days, Birns checked himself out of the hospital and was well on his way to a full recovery when he was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed weapon. During the trial, Birns testified that he did not see his assailant and that whoever came up behind him in the cloakroom had the gun. He refused to identify Duncan as the man who shot him. He denied even knowing Duncan at all. Likewise, Duncan's recollection of the incident was so vague that he wasn't even called to testify as a witness.
Two months later, Rudy Duncan took his 11-year-old foster son, Stanley to a movie show at the Uptown theater outside E. 105th Street and Saint Clair Avenue. Afterward, they walked to a confectionery for ice cream. When they got into their car back in the theater parking lot, two men wearing white cotton gloves walked up alongside, one on each side. With a terrified Stanley crouching in the seat, they fired five bullets into Duncan. Police immediately began a search for Birns. They found him, but they couldn't find evidence to tie him to the murder. He was released. Duncan's murder went officially unsolved.
Rise to power.
Birns' reputation as a brutal, ruthless enforcer made it easy for him to establish lucrative "protection" services. Legal businesses who wished to be allowed to operate undisturbed had to pay him as a labor consultant. Those who refused to pay would usually find their store windows broken or their cars blown up. In any event, those who initially refused would soon pay up.
During the late 1930s, Birns became heavily involved in protecting whorehouses or "vice resorts" as they were dubbed by the media. With the backing of the Cleveland crime family, Birns operated freely and was well liked by all the prostitutes of his whore houses. Many of Birns's clients were judges, politicians and police officers of high rank. They would serve as important contacts for him in the future and vice versa. In 1938, Birns visited Canada for a vacation. Upon his re-entry to the United States, he was questioned briefly about his criminal history and answered honestly. At the time, Birns was unaware of the Immigration Act of 1917 which required any alien convicted of a crime of moral turpitude to gain permission prior to entering or leaving the country. It would take a couple of years of paperwork to catch up.
In 1942, at the height of the Second World War, Birns was arrested on a deportation warrant based on the auto theft and bribery convictions. During his incarceration, Birns tried to enlist in the United States Army. However, this was to no avail. Two years later, his attorney was successful in getting him released on bond. However, officials were determined to keep Birns locked up. A wartime presidential order was issued charging Birns as an enemy alien and he was interred at McAllester, Oklahoma. This greatly offended Birns. Although he had never applied for American citizenship, Birns always considered himself a patriotic American.
Upon his release in 1944, Birns returned to Cleveland and was well known by the police, judges and the public. He was regarded as a celebrity gangster and had many public sympathizers in what was generally seen as a vendetta.
Successful restauranteur.
During this time, Birns was building a profitable legitimate business as a restauranteur. He opened his Ten-Eleven Club at 1011 Chester Avenue. It was a popular nightspot which had a reputation for serving excellent food. The restaurant was usually frequented by local and out-of-town big shots. Police and newspaper reporters ate and drank on the house. When the tragic Cleveland East Ohio Gas Explosion that killed 134 persons and left thousands homeless occurred in 1944, Birns kept the club open, 24 hours a day, feeding policemen, firemen and rescue workers for free.
His Alhambra Tavern on the East Side was another popular restaurant. By law, convicted felons weren't supposed to be legally able to get liquor licenses. Birns managed to bypass that by disguising his connections to the Alhambra. At one point, he was simply its "public relations director." The Cleveland safety director denounced the deal in which the state okayed Birns's license as "stinking to high heaven of politics."
Muscling in the numbers operations and policy games.
During the 1940s, Birns made a longstanding alliance and had become closely involved with the local Cleveland family mobsters such as Angelo Lonardo. Lonardo had already taken over the black lottery and numbers operations. Birns was determined to firmly keep this traditionally black racket under his control.
One of the best known of the black numbers operators was Donald "The Kid" King, the future boxing promoter. According to a 1988 Plains Dealer series by Christopher Evans, "King was flamboyant — always seen with a .38 in his belt and a big cigar in his mouth". In the mid-1960s, King and his partner, a Cleveland prize-fighter named Victor Ogletree were reportedly grossing $15,000 a day on policy. King gained prominence among the other operators in 1954, after he thwarted a robbery of one of his gambling houses, killing one of the stick-up men. The shooting was deemed a justifiable homicide.
In October 1956, Birns sent an emissary to King and his colleagues demanding that they pay up to $200 a week to make sure that none of their competitors paid odds of more than 500 to 1, or pay the consequences. They initially agreed but by December deemed the price too high. King eventually began holding out on the protection money being paid on a regular basis to Birns, Lonardo and their associates.
One morning in 1957, an explosion ripped apart the front porch of King's house. Uninjured, he went to the police and accused Birns of ordering the bombing. King also informed police of his decision to get out of the racket. Largely on King's testimony, Birns and the others were indicted. A few weeks later, Birns attempted to dissuade King from testifying by sending some of his men to kill him at his home. King was ambushed outside his house. Several pellets of shot hit him in the back of his head, but King survived. He was then taken to the hospital and refused to cooperate any further with police.
At the trial, however, King told jurors that Birns's emissary had offered him $10,000 not to testify: "He said if I didn't testify, he would guarantee there would be no more shooting at me or bombing my house and I'd have no reason to be scared no more." The prosecution even produced a surprise witness who was a former employee of the rackets. On the stand, the Press reported, "she burst into tears again and again and refused to answer questions as Birns and the other defendants glared at her. Her attorney told the judge she was told that she and her 12-year-old daughter would be killed if she testified." Elijah Abercrombie, a co-defendant, told the jury that police had offered to let him run an unhampered gambling game if he gave them information against Birns. Defense lawyer Fred Garmone called King "a scheming, lying, witness-fixing extortionist himself."
When the trial began, King was cast as the star witness in the trial. The judge and jury had difficulty understanding King and his rapid, inarticulate speech led the local newspapers to dub him "The Talker". The jury deliberated 11 hours and the trial resulted in Birns and the other defendants acquittal.
Relationship with law enforcement.
Throughout his lifetime, Alex Birns craved respectability and sought to obtain it through his popular Alhambra Restaurant, where many judges and politicians dined. During the early morning hours, Birns would often send food over to the nearby Fifth District police station for the police officers working the late shift.
In spite of being diligently pursued by law enforcement for most of his life, Birns eventually came to respect and admire the city's police officers. Once, when he was under a 24 hour surveillance, Birns was leaving a Cleveland Indians baseball game. He happened to notice the two detectives assigned to follow him and flagged them over. The officers agreed to drive him to his next destination. When the officers were reprimanded by a superior, Birns intervened
on their behalf.
In 1959, Birns physically assaulted a police officer. He was convicted of assault and battery and was once again sent to the Warrensville Workhouse for nine months. He practically ran the place. The superintendent was later fired for the liberties he allowed Birns.
While in prison, Alex Birns was accused of masterminding the car bombing of numbers operator, Joe Allen, in an attempt to shake him down for 25 percent of his operation. The state tried Birns twice for the crime. A workhouse guard admitted to having acted as a go-between in trying to arrange a deal with Allen. The outcome of the first trial was a hung jury. The second acquitted him. Upon his acquittal, Birns blew kisses to the jury. In a Page One editorial, a newspaper thundered, "Who runs this town — Birns or the Law?".
The relentless prosecutors, however, didn't give up and accused Birns of trying to contact a juror in the second case. He said he had merely asked an Alhambra waitress to see if the juror would be fair to him. Ten of the jurors signed a statement protesting the charge that they had been unduly influenced.
Assassination attempt.
In 1959, Birns was shot at by an unknown assailant as he arrived home. The gunman missed, whereupon, Birns cruised the neighborhood on the lookout for him. Upon investigation, Cleveland police picked up a small-time hood named Clarence "Sonny" Coleman, who owed money to Birns for interrogation. He was released soon after questioning. A short time afterward, Coleman was shot on a neighborhood street shortly after midnight. Three bullets hit him, but he managed to run up to the front porch of a house yelling, "Let me in, baby, let me in!" In the hospital, he told police the shooter was a man in the back seat of a car driven by Shondor Birns. Birns was arrested and brought to the booking window at Central Station.
A month later, Coleman changed his mind and told police that he had only speculated that it was Birns in the car. However, the police arrested Coleman as a material witness. He changed his mind again and reluctantly agreed to testify. At the trial, a neighbor backed Birns's alibi. He said he saw Birns arrive home at 12:07 a.m., about the time of the shooting several miles away. It took the jurors four hours to reach a verdict, which resulted in Birns's acquittal. They expressed their refusal to believe the changing testimony of Coleman who had been a dope peddler and police informant. Police predicted what the press called "a fresh outbreak of shootings and violence in Cleveland's multi-million-dollar numbers racket."
Mervin Gold murder.
Birns had been suspected of two murders, including that of a financier named Mervin Gold. In the 1960s, Gold was being investigated for using stolen Canadian bonds for using a bank loan. On July 8, 1963, he was found murdered and stuck in the trunk of his car. He had been beaten, strangled with a clothesline and shot in the chest. A blanket was wrapped around his head. He was shot three more times in the skull. The coroner, Samuel Gerber, estimated his time of death as shortly before midnight Friday.
Anticipating an untimely demise, Gold left behind an affidavit claiming that Birns had given him the bonds. His wife told police that Gold was on his way to meet with Birns the night he was murdered. Police also found a tape made by Gold of a phone call between himself and Birns. A pickup order was sent out for Birns. On Monday his car turned up outside a motel in Toledo. The motel owner said he had checked in Saturday and sought treatment for an injured right hand. He told the doctor a firecracker caused the injury.
On Wednesday morning, Birns called John Kocevar, chief deputy Cuyahoga County
sheriff. He arranged to surrender at a meeting spot in suburban Garfield Heights.
He told Kocevar, "I would have surrendered yesterday, but it was a Jewish holiday." Somebody also tipped off the press. A reporter and photograph were waiting when he arrived. Birns told them, "Thanks for coming, fellows."
Birns was taken to Central Station for questioning by the head of the Homicide Unit, Lieutenant Carl Delau. Amid aggressive interrogation by Delau, Birns insisted he had been dining on frog legs in a Garfield Heights steakhouse at the night of Gold's murder. Birns claimed that he was at home with a woman of fine character. He did not name her, but said she was willing to testify for him. His bail was set at $50,000, which he posted with ease.
Then, the Plain Dealer reported, "Birns cocked his summer straw hat, waved goodbye to reporters, walked out of the building and down the front steps to where his attorney, James R. Willis, was waiting." All concerned was shocked when two days later, Birns produced Allene Leonards, a shy, 24-year-old teacher in the Garfield Heights school system who confirmed his alibi claiming that she had been with Birns the whole night. This was also confirmed by the owner. Birns would later divorce his first wife, Jane, and marry Leonards a year later. He had married Jane in 1952, and had one son, Michael (died 1978), with her.
Self-appointed peacemaker and mediator of disputes.
In the 1960s, Birns was having trouble with some black numbers operators. It was during this time, that he came into contact with a brash ambitious young Irish-American upstart named Danny Greene. Impressed with his fearless attitude and abilities, Birns hired Greene to be an enforcer for his various numbers operators. It was a decision which Birns would eventually regret.
For a relatively small cut of their profits, $1,000 weekly, Birns had been serving as a peacemaker and mediator of disputes among the blacks. He also laid off or distributed big bets to other cities like Pittsburgh, so no single operator lost too much if a number came up. In 1968, after a massive investigation into his assets by the Internal Revenue Service, Birns was convicted and sent to federal prison for lying about his assets.
The 1970s.
By the 1970s, Alex Birns had mellowed significantly, playing handball daily and spending several hours on lunch and a cocktail or two. He didn't want any more trouble. He promised his parole officer, "Kid, I don't break any provisions of parole. I'll tell you why. If I go back to jail, I'll die there."
More often, Birns chose to lunch at the Theatrical, where he always sat at the end of the bar. Birns once told a reporter, "If I'm the city's biggest crook, why do they all want to be my friend? I'll tell you why. Most of them are worse than I
am, and they all know that I know..."
After lunch, he would head out to the Silver Quill or Christie's Lounge to chat with the owner and the barmaid and sometimes buy drinks for the regulars. By this time, he was planning to retire and live out his twilight years in Florida. However, when longtime Cleveland family boss, John Scalish died, Birns teamed up with the faction backing James T. Licavoli as the new boss.
Opposition from black racketeers.
Birns was always dealing with heavy opposition from a few black gangsters who wanted independence from him and the more powerful and politically connected Mafiosi of the Cleveland family. Several close murder attempts led Birns to buy a
Doberman Pinscher to protect his home. In February, Birns and his attractive girlfriend, fourteen years his junior, were walking downtown when a car with several black men drove by. Two shots were fired, but neither Birns nor his girlfriend were hit.
Several months later, Birns walked into an east side bar in response to a meeting requested by several black numbers racketeers. This time, Birns brought his heavily armed black bodyguard along in anticipation of trouble. Upon arrival,
Birns and his bodyguard were immediately accosted by several of the numbers men. One of the gangsters shouted, "We want you out of the business or you're dead", while pulling back his coat to reveal a pistol in his waistband. The bodyguard reacted quickly, leveling a small sub-machine gun from under his overcoat. Some customers scurried towards the exits. The group continued shouting at Birns as he and his bodyguard cautiously backed out of the bar and left.
Conflict with Danny Greene.
The relationship between Danny Greene and Alex Birns also began to sour. Greene envied Birns's control of the rackets and looked forward to the day when it would be his. He was also jealous of Birns's immense wealth and popularity with the Cleveland media and public. The death of boss John Scalish had put Birns and Greene on opposite sides of a Mafia dispute with Greene supporting challenger John Nardi and Birns supporting the heir apparent gangster James T. Licavoli. Greene was soon willing to take on Birns.
Greene had requested Birns for a loan of $75,000. Greene wanted the money to set up a "cheat spot," a speakeasy and gambling house. Therefore, Birns had arranged a loan for Greene through the Gambino family. Somehow later, the money wound up in the hands of Billy Cox, a numbers operator, who used it to purchase narcotics. The police raided his house, arrested him, seized the narcotics and what was left of the $75,000. The Gambino family, from whom Birns had borrowed the loan, wanted their money. Birns pressed Greene but Greene flatly refused to return the money; instead asserting that it wasn't his fault that it got lost.
In retaliation, Birns gave $25,000 with an associate to hire a hit man for Greene to be murdered, especially in the event of any harm befalling him. This contract was soon taken by several minor underworld characters who were burglars by trade. This contract would result in numerous failed assassination attempts on Greene.
Not long after, Greene found an unexploded bomb in his car when he pulled into a Collinwood service station for gas. The explosive was wired improperly and failed to detonate. Greene disassembled the bomb himself, removed the dynamite, and brought the rest of the package to the Cleveland police lieutenant, Edward Kovacic. Kovacic offered him police protection, but he refused. He also refused to hand over the bomb, telling him, "I'm going to send this back to the old bastard that sent it to me." Suspecting that Birns was behind it, Greene decided to retaliate.
Assassination.
In March 1975, Holy Saturday, the eve of Easter, Birns was blown up via a bomb containing C-4, a potent military explosive in the lot behind Christy's Lounge, the former Jack & Jill West Lounge, a go-go spot at 2516 Detroit Ave. Birns was blown several feet through the roof of the car and his torso landed near the passenger door. A man who walked Birns to his car braved flames and smoke and located him near the car. Apparently, Birns was still alive, though barely. The man only managed to drag away Birns's upper torso. His face, arms and chest were bloodied and blackened. Birns' nose was broken when his body landed on the street after being blown out the top of his car. His hair was scorched off from the heat of the horrific blast. Birns had been blown in half. His severed legs landed fifty feet away and other smaller parts of him were scattered all over the place. Towards his death, the upper part of his body was convulsing violently.
A chain link fence between Christy's and St. Malachi Church caught many of the smaller fragments of flesh and bone. At first glance, they resembled steaming pieces of meat.
Though Birns's Cadillac was demolished and smoking heavily, his state-of-the-art burglar system survived. A leather gym bag and gym shoes had been blown from the trunk. Amazingly, a paper bag of clothing from inside his car survived. It read: "Diamond's of Ohio - Fashions for men which women love." Police said the blast was among the most powerful they had ever investigated. Police and bomb squad members worked an entire day examining the bombing scene. Coroners workers spent hours collecting as many pieces of skin and bones that they could find. A total of $843 in cash was found on or around Birns's body. The Internal Revenue Service promptly claimed the money to be put toward back taxes that Birns owed.
The aftermath.
In the following weeks, investigators wrongly concentrated on several black numbers operators as suspects rather than Danny Greene. On Birns and the supposed involvement of blacks in his murder, one black numbers operator said:
"Its dumb to talk about blacks doing Shondor. Shon wasn't no bad fella. He was white but it didn't make no difference. Shon had a black soul. He was black through and through. Shit, there wasn't no racial prejudice in that goddamn Shondor Birns at all. He was a helluva guy... No, No. There ain't gonna be no more Shondors..."
In the "Cleveland Press", Dick McLaughlin summed up his career: "A muscleman whose specialty was controlling numbers gambling on the East Side, keeping the peace among rival operators and getting a cut from each of them, Birns was a feared man because of his violent reaction to any adversary. Yet he was popular, had an engaging personality, was known by many newsmen because he was good copy and was ever ready to buy them a drink. He was a feared man, but a genial and generous man, holding court almost daily at the Theatrical Lounge where he lunched."
Birns's widow was oblivious to his conflict with Danny Greene, since Birns had largely sheltered her from his underworld activities. Aware that Greene was also a pet lover, she gave his Doberman Pinscher to him. His remains are held at Hillcrest Cemetery in Bedford Heights, Ohio. Greene himself survived a little while longer (although the Birns-allied Licavoli faction continued to try to kill him due to his partnership with their enemy Nardi) but like Nardi was killed by getting blown to pieces in a car bombing.

Oxford Pastorate

The Oxford Pastorate has provided chaplains to work alongside students in the University of Oxford, England, since it was founded in 1893 by evangelical Anglicans. Its objective is to encourage "true and lively faith" among Oxford's student population.
Evangelicalism.
British historian Mark Smith cites the Oxford Pastorate as an example of thriving evangelicalism in early 20th century England. He contends that the Pastorate's success was due to it differing markedly from the stereotypes often associated with evangelicalism: "Far from being negative, exclusive and oppositional, it represented an evangelicalism which, while definite about its own position, was positive, inclusive and constructive in its emphasis."
Links with C.S. Lewis.
In 1941, Oxford Pastorate chaplain Stella Aldwinckle founded the Oxford Socratic Club, whose first president was C.S. Lewis.
New focus on postgraduates.
Since its inception in 1893, the main focus of the Pastorate had been on working with undergraduates. In 2008, the Pastorate's trustees decided to focus the ministry on Oxford's rapidly growing postgraduate student community.
Chaplains.
Award-winning British author and theologian Jonathan Brant was retained in 2008 to serve as the new Graduate Pastorate Chaplain. He is assisted by two associate chaplains: Emilie Noteboom, and Christian Hofreiter, who is a Gosden graduate scholar in theology at Keble College.

Lomographa bimaculata

The White-pinion Spotted (Lomographa bimaculata) is a geometer moth species (family Geometridae). It belongs to the large geometer moth subfamily Ennominae, and therein to the tribe Baptini. It is – under its junior synonym – the type species of its genus "Lomographa". It is also (under its original name "Phalaena bimaculata") the type species of "Bapta", a junior objective synonym of "Lomographa" and the namesake of the Baptini.
Two subspecies have been named, as well as several forms (e.g. "bipunctata"):
Ecology and description.
The rather common species inhabits mainly woodland and can be found all over Europe. However, it seems to be absent on the Balkans, between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Greece. It is also not found on Iceland and rarer at the periphery of its range; for example, north of the English Midlands and on Ireland it is found only locally.
The adults fly usually in early summer, e.g. from May to June in the British Isles. But in exceptional cases it is found later in the year; it was recorded in Germany in early August 1938, for example. It is a mainly nocturnal species which can be attracted to light by night. The adults' wingspan is 22–26 mm. The wings are a very pale silvery grey, with two dark grey spots on each forewing's leading edge, from which the two bands typical of Ennominae (but in this species consisting only of very small and weak grey speckles) run over the fore- and hindwings to form a semicircle. The body is also whitish.
This moth has a single generation per year (though late sightings suggest that this might not always be so). The caterpillars feed on "Prunus" species – including Bird Cherry ("P. padus") and Blackthorn ("P. spinosa") – as well as on "Crataegus" (hawthorns).

Jussi Parikka

Jussi Parikka is a Finnish new media theorist and Reader in Media & Design at Winchester School of Art (University of Southampton). He is also adjunct professor of digital culture theory at the University of Turku in Finland. Until May 2011 Parikka was the Director of the Cultures of the Digital Economy (CoDE) research institute at Anglia Ruskin University and the founding Co-Director of the Anglia Research Centre for Digital Culture.
Biography.
Parikka was awarded a Ph.D. in Cultural History from the University of Turku in 2007. He is a member of the Editorial Board for Fibreculture-journal and a member of the Leonardo Journal Digital Reviews Panel.
In 1995, Parikka deferred his national service and spent 18 months as an assistant fisheries inspector in Oulu.
Parikka has published extensively on digital art, digital culture and cultural theory in Finnish and English in journals such as "Ctheory", "Theory, Culture & Society", "Fibreculture", "Media History", "Postmodern Culture" and "Game Studies". His texts have been translated into Polish, Portuguese and Indonesian. He has published four single authored books; in Finnish on media theory in the age of cybernetics (Koneoppi. Ihmisen, teknologian ja median kytkennät, (2004)) and in English, "Digital Contagions: A Media Archaeology of Computer Viruses" (2007), the award winning "Insect Media" (2010) and most recently "What is Media Archaeology?" (2012).
"Digital Contagions" is the first book to offer a comprehensive and critical analysis of the culture and history of the computer virus phenomenon. The book maps the anomalies of network culture from the angles of security concerns, the biopolitics of digital systems, and the aspirations for artificial life in software. 
The genealogy of network culture is approached from the standpoint of accidents that are endemic to the digital media ecology. Viruses, worms, and other software objects are not, then, seen merely from the perspective of anti-virus research or practical security concerns, but as cultural and historical expressions that traverse a non-linear field from fiction to technical media, from net art to politics of software.
His work on Insect Media combines themes from media archaeology, posthumanism and animal studies to put forth a new history of how insects and technology frame critical, scientific and technological thought. It won the Society for Cinema and Media Studies 2012 Anne Friedberg Award for Innovative Scholarship. He has also discussed this work in dialogue with historian Etienne Benson and media theorist Bernard Dionsius Geoghegan on the Cultural Technologies podcast.
Most recently, Parikka has written on media archaeology as a theory and methodology in various publications, including "Media Archaeology" (co-edited with Erkki Huhtamo) and "What is Media Archaeology?"
With Garnet Hertz, Parikka co-authored a paper entitled "Zombie Media: Circuit Bending Media Archaeology into an Art Method," which was nominated for the 2011 Transmediale Vilem Flusser media theory award.
Research activity.
Dr. Parikka's research activities include continental philosophy, media theory, the politics and history of new media, media archaeology, new materialist cultural analysis and various other topics relating to anomalies, media and the body.

Persian war elephants

History.
Under the Achaemenids.
The Persians are known to have used fifteen war elephants at Gaugamela, but some people claim that they had been used previously in the Greek campaign of king Xerxes I of Persia, and even further back at the time of Darius the Great at the Indus, the Danube and against the Scythians in 512 BC. Neither Xenophon nor Herodotus mention war elephants in their accounts of these earlier campaigns.
Armenian wars.
The most famous was the Battle of Avarayr () in 451 CE, where Armenian rebels led by Vartan Mamikonian led an army of 66,000 men to gain independence from the Sassanids under Yazdegerd II, who opposed them with 300,000 men and war elephants.
Despite their victory over the rebels and the death of their leaders (including Vartan Mamikonian), Yazdegerd's forces gave the Armenians their religious freedom, largely due to the fierce and relentless spirit that they presented in the battle. While they won the battle, Persian forces had a disproportionate number of casualties and deaths compared to the Armenians.
Ghaznavid war elephants.
The Ghaznavids used armored war elephants against the Turks of Central Asia and the Hindus of India in the 11th and 12th centuries. Islamic historians record that a standing force of 1000 elephants was maintained at Ghazni (also: Ghazna), the capital, and that as many as 400, 500, or even 700 elephants were deployed in some campaigns by the famed (and ferocious) Mahmud; purportedly, each animal had a crew of four archers and/or spearmen borne in "castle-like" structures on the elephants' backs.
Persians fighting against elephants, 18th Century India.
In 1739, Nader Shah of Persia's Afsharid dynasty invaded India and led an army to the capital, Delhi; but he was halted on the way by the Mughul ruler Muhammad Shah and his huge army, which greatly outnumbered the Persian army. The Indians also had war elephants with them; these had blades on their tusks which they had been taught to use against the enemy. Nader Shah is said to have sent pots of oil to the front lines, where the accompanying goats' horns were ordered to be set on fire. The goats charged at the elephants, who panicked and turned around, killing thousands of Indian troops, as reportedly had happened at the battle of al-Qādisiyyah between the Sassanid Persians and the Muslim invaders of their empire in 636 AD. Different authorities claim that Nader Shah ordered camels to be paired together and platforms constructed between them; a mixture of naphtha combustibles was placed on the platforms with orders to set them on fire during the battle so that the Mughal elephants would flee at the sight of the fire and cause mayhem in their own army. In either event, the Mughul elephants apparently proved in this case (the Battle of Karnal) to be a "double-edged sword". Following his defeat of Muhammad Shah, Nader's soldiers carried many elephants home with them to Iran.
Origin and training.
Persian war elephants were trained by their rider, called a mahout, who would also ride the elephant into battle. The mahouts were of Indian origin, and so were the archers. Training elephants was a difficult and they would be hard to maintain because they ate so much food and water. On the march, huge paths needed to be cut for the elephants. Many were kept in the shah's menagerie the most famous of which was Khosrau II where he kept a "thousand white elephants."
Weapons.
Persian elephants were from Indian origin and were probably armed with Indian styled weapons. The men(excluding the driver) sat in a large tower from which troops would fight. The elephant itself would normally be armed with thin plate armour (the Sassanids used chain mail as well as thin plate armour)and would bear a large crenelated wooden "howdah" on its back. The troops would be armed with bow and arrows and javelin. The sworn enemy of the Sassanids, the Eastern Roman empire, were terrified by the huge beasts, making them very effective in battle. When they were used at the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, they came to be known as "double edged weapons". King ( shah ) Yazdgerd III attempted to use war elephants to fight off Arab invaders, however his elephants got sand in their eyes and panicked. They turned around and ran amok, killing their own troops.
Crushing by elephant.
Those people that were traitors to the army, enemies of the empire and criminals were crushed by the elephants this way and executed in the age of Sassanids they also used this method of execution for training for battle.

St Mary's, Stretton

St Mary's is the Church of England parish church for the village of Stretton, north of Burton upon Trent. It is part of the Diocese of Lichfield.
St Mary's church was
(...) wholly paid for by John Gretton (d. 1899) of Bladon House in Winshill, a native of Stretton and a director of the Burton brewers Bass, Ratcliff, and Gretton. (...) dedicated to St. Mary, it was designed by J. T. Micklethwaite of Westminster on an aisled, cruciform plan with a massive crossing tower. Built externally of Stanton stone and internally of Runcorn stone, it has a short chancel, a four-bayed nave, and north and south aisles, each with a porch at the west end. There is a chapel at the east end of the south aisle and two vestries along the north side of the chancel, one of them used in 1999 as a parish office and the other as a meeting room. The nave arcades and chancel arch are chamfered with moulded capitals on polygonal piers, and the nave and chancel ceilings have painted wooden panels. The church retains most of its original decorations and fittings: wooden rood screen and choir stalls carved in a mixed Arts and Crafts- Perpendicular style by J. E. Knox of Kennington; chancel floor inlaid with black and white marble; stone side-chapel arch carved by Robert Bridgeman of Lichfield; octagonal font of Frosterley marble with elaborate wooden canopy, also carved by Knox; stained glass by Sir William Richmond in the east window of the chancel and in the south window of the side chapel; and altar fittings by William Morris. Most of the early 20th-century memorial windows in the aisles come from the Whitefriars studio in London. A bell was taken from the 1838 church for use as a call bell, and a further three bells installed in 1897 were recast as six in 1960.

1925 VFL Grand Final

The 1925 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Geelong Football Club and Collingwood Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 10 October 1925. It was the 29th annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1925 VFL season. The match, attended by 64,288 spectators, was won by Geelong by a margin of 10 points, marking that club's first VFL premiership victory.
Geelong, competing in their first ever VFL Grand Final, had been the best side all season, having lost only two games on their way to the minor premiership and at one stage put together a sequence of 12 successive wins. Collingwood on the other hand had only made the finals on percentage, a spot only cemented when they defeated South Melbourne by 65 points in the final round.
Geelong outscored Collingwood in each of the first three quarters to open up a 25 point lead going into the final term. Collingwood finished strongly but Geelong held on to claim to first VFL premiership. Captain-coach Cliff Rankin starred with five goals.
Tom Fitzmaurice had extra reason to celebrate ,as it was his 100th VFL match and his third successive premiership, having won flags in the previous two seasons at Essendon.
Aftermath.
In what was Geelong's first VFL premiership and first premiership since the VFA title in 1886, The Age reported: 
The scene in the Geelong dressing-room was remarkable. The players who had succeeded, where teams for 29 years had failed, seemed to be the coolest men there. They had just come out of a strenuous contest, and were besieged by enthusiastic supporters, but they accepted the plaudits with becoming modesty. Not one of them had been in a premiership team, save Tom Fitzmaurice, who played with Essendon in their last two premierships, and not one of them was alive when Geelong last gained the honours.

The village was established in 1945 by a gar'in of German HaBonim members which had formed in 1938. Because the land on which the kibbutz lies was bought with money "Yitzhak" Ochberg, a South African philanthropist, had given, the Keren HaYesod wanted the kibbutz named Even "Yitzhak" (, "lit." Stone of Yitzhak), but eventually the kibbutz had its way: the kibbutz is named Gal'ed in memory of the HaBonim members killed in World War II – established on the tract of land "Even Yitzhak."

Philibert Vrau (b. at Lille, 19 November 1829; d. there, 16 May 1905) was a French businessman, lay Roman Catholic activist, and Christian socialist.
Life.
His father was a manufacturer of sewing thread; his mother, Sophie Aubineau, was a Parisian. He attended the municipal college of Lille. His teacher, a pupil of Victor Cousin, inspired him with an enthusiasm for philosophy.
He gave up the practice of his Catholic religion for four years. During this time he was active in a purely philanthropic society for the aged poor. After his conversion in 1854 he turned this into a religious society. 
Philibert then had to retrieve heavy financial losses of the family firm. With his brother-in-law, the physician Dr. Camille Féron-Vrau (1831–1908), he established religious and beneficial societies for the working people, planned model dwellings for them, and also organized a society of employers and employees. They insisted on the right of the labourer to a living wage. 
Féron-Vrau was arrested in 1892 for allowing a religious element in the association of employers and employees of which he was president, and it was dissolved by law, but was soon revived under another name. Philibert Vrau was sentenced to a month's imprisonment and a fine for allowing some Sisters of Providence, in secular dress, to continue their superintendence of the women in his factory, a charge which they had begun in 1876.
Nocturnal adoration of the Blessed Sacrament was introduced into Lille by Philibert Vrau in 1857. He was largely instrumental in establishing Eucharistic Congresses; the first congress was held at Lille. His nephew, Paul Féron-Vrau, took over in 1900 the Assumptionist imprint "la Bonne Presse", for Catholic works.

Gull (dinghy)

The Gull sailing dinghy was designed by Ian Proctor in 1956, originally as a frameless double-chine plywood boat. However, it has been through several incarnations: the wooden Mark I, GRP Mark III, GRP Gull Spirit and GRP Gull Calypso. Today it is popular with sailing schools, especially in the UK.
The original prototype Gull (the "Jolly Roger") was built by Ian Proctor to teach his own children the skills of dinghy sailing. This became a production boat, often built from a kit, and produced by Smallcraft of Blockley. A GRP version was produced from 1966 but, being a near-exact copy of the wooden boat, was not well suited to GRP manufacture.
A Mark II was introduced as a cheaper GRP version without a permanent fore-deck, but did not prove very popular. The original boats became known as Mark 1 and wooden boats, probably mainly from kits, continued to be built to this specification. In the late 1970s a Mark 3 was produced, starting with no 1800. This was a radical redesign featuring a round bilge hull, greater beam and side decks. The design was optimised for and only available in GRP. Few wooden boats are believed to have been built after the Mk3 came out.
The Gull Spirit was a major redesign with a lot of innovative features developed by Anglo-Marine. This was followed by the Gull Calypso, which is a simplified design by Hartley Laminates, with no wooden parts.
The Gull has a reputation as a safe and stable boat but, particularly with the addition of a spinnaker, it is raced competitively. It is classed as a two-person boat but can easily be launched, sailed and recovered single-handed, making it a suitable cruising boat for the solo sailor. It can easily be rowed (with the addition of rowlocks) and can be fitted with an outboard engine. Hence, it is a very versatile boat.
As of August 2013 there is now a new Gull available. The Mark 6 Gull has been redesigned and modernized and is now available from the builders, Hartley Laminates UK.
