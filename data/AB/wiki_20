We Got Married

We Got Married () is a South Korean reality variety show, one segment of the Sunday Sunday Night program. First broadcast in 2008, the show pairs up Korean celebrities to show what life would be like if they were married. Each week, couples are assigned missions to complete, with candid interviews of the participants to reveal their thoughts and feelings.
The Hosts.
The pilot episode that aired as a special on New Year's Day was hosted by Lee Hyuk-jae, Hyun Young and Oh Sang Jin. The first season, only Hyuk-jae remains as an original host. He was joined by Kim Won Hee, and Lee Hwi Jae for the first 8 episodes until Hwi Jae replaced Jung Hyung Don as one of the grooms in episode 9. Won Hee later left to film a movie after episode 12, and Park Myung Soo was then introduced as host in episode 13. After episode 17, Hwi Jae resumed his position as MC, and the latest addition of Kang Soo Jung, now the only female, brings a total of 5 hosts. Lee Hwi Jae officially left the show after Episode 30 in order to make time for other programs. In preparation for its new format in addition to budget cuts, the MCs and live studio recordings were officially dropped after Episode 36.
In Season II, the series consisted of three permanent hosts Park Mi-Sun, Jo Hyung Gi and Kim Na Young, and guest commentators from different age groups appearing every few weeks. The studio was replaced by a smaller room with no live audience where the progress of the marriages is discussed. As of episode 78, host Jo Hyung Gi no longer appears on the show. In Episode 80 and 81 where the husbands and wives were separated into two groups, the couples watched the footage along with the hosts in the studio. From episode 100 and above, Seulong and Jinwoon of 2AM become regular commentators along with Park Mi Sun, Kim Jung Min, and Kim Na Young.
2013, The Hosts are Park Mi Sun, Kim Jung Min, Lee Ji Hye and Danny Ahn.
2008 Lunar New Year Special.
This special pilot episode aired on February 6, 2008. The four arranged couples must prepare dinner with a fixed amount of money.
Season 1.
With a new format and slightly different couples, newlyweds are given a mission to complete each week. As during the special pilot episode, interviewed participants provide a unique perspective on the ongoing relationship conflicts and developments. All of the recorded material is then played in front of the participants, MCs, and audience who add commentary or clarification.
Beginning with a Lunar New Year's Special in 2009 with three new couples, a new format is introduced into the show, first forecasted through the addition of Kangin and Lee Yoon Ji. Each couple is given a concept to portray; in Kangin and Lee Yoon Ji's case, a college couple living with a limited income. The show now consists of more special effects and editing in order to show each couple in a set atmosphere and theme.
Season 2.
As of May 2009, the producers announced another change in the format with all four couples departing, cutting down to just one couple and shortening the show to just 60 minutes. The show will now portray a more realistic side to what a marriage is, instead of ""the painted image of marriage based on romance"". For the first time, a real couple is cast in the show. Guest celebrities are invited to be show's commentators for each episode so that they can share their opinions on marriage on behalf of their age group. Kim Yong Jun and Hwang Jung Eum also do the interview room together dressed in wedding attire.
However, due to low ratings, the show returned to its old format with the addition of a make-believe couple actor Park Jae Jung and After School member Uee on August 2, 2009. For the Chuseok special, Brown Eyed Girls' Gain & 2AM's Jo Kwon and SG Wannabe's Lee Seok Hun & host Kim Na Young appeared as two new couples. The episode achieved Season II's highest rating, and Gain and Jo Kwon were announced to be a permanent couple.
Season 3.
Season three officially begins on April 9, with two additional couples upon the departure of Yonghwa & Seohyun, as well as a new format. Park Hwi Sun and K.will are added for Season III to the cast as MCs.
Season 4.
Additional couples
Controversies.
Lee Si Young joined the cast of MBC variety reality show We Got Married where she is paired up with Jun Jin of Shinhwa. As of June 2009, they have become the first couple to officially have a real relationship outside the show. However, they broke up after a 6 month relationship.
In late March 2010, MBC stopped broadcast of new episodes due to labour strikes, with repeats airing instead. This event, compounded with the ROKS Cheonan sinking incident, which caused cancellation of most variety shows at the time, resulted in backlogged of recordings for Jo Kwon & Gain and Yonghwa & Seohyun couple. With the contents of their latest episodes which were recorded from a few months previously, instead of regular 1–2 weeks from the original.
During Lee Joon & Oh Yeon Seo's season 4 tenure (broadcasting from September 2012 through February 2013), Yeon Seo was observed meeting in public with Lee Jang Woo, her male co-star from the drama series, "Oh Ja Ryong is Coming". When pictures and videos were released in January 2013, media and WGM fans surmised Yeon Seo and Jang Woo, formerly of WGM (Season 3), were in a romantic relationship. Because Yeon Seo and Lee Joon were in the midst of filming WGM at the time this news was released, the integrity of their virtual marriage was questioned by fans. The negative reaction was further exacerbated by Yeon Seo's multiple declarations of romantic interest in Lee Joon (e.g. as her "ideal type" and wanting to meet with him outside of filming). This backlash and perceived broken trust resulted in fans voicing their desire for Yeon Seo to exit WGM. Shortly after the rumors of Yeon Seo and Jang Woo's relationship surfaced, Lee Joon publicly expressed his frustration about not having his voice heard, with online fans suggesting it was due to his overbearing workload and/or Yeon Seo's alleged relationship with Jang Woo. A few weeks later, Lee Joon and Yeon Seo ended their tenure on WGM.

Giovani Devoti (born at Rome, 11 July 1744; died there 18 September 1820) was an Italian canon lawyer and bishop.
Life.
At the age of twenty he occupied a chair of canon law at the Sapienza University of Rome. After twenty-five years service in this position Pope Pius VI appointed him Bishop of Anagni.
He resigned the see in 1804, to become titular Archbishop of Carthage, As such he filled several important positions at Rome. He also accompanied Pope Pius VII during his exile in France.

In 1817, the King of Spain made obligatory the study of the "Institutiones" of Devoti at the University of Alcalá; and in 1836, the University of Louvain accepted it as a classical manual of canon law. The work subsequently became more useful for the history than for the practice of canon law.

Frank Androff

Frank Fred Androff (25 November 1913 – 18 July 1987), alias "The Great One", was a heavyweight professional boxer from Anoka, Minnesota.
Professional career.
Androff made his professional boxing debut on February 2, 1933 with a four-round decision victory against Rene Barrett. Androff's record remained unblemished until his fourth fight, a six-round draw in a rematch with Barrett. After two more wins pushed his record to 5-0-1, Androff lost for the first time, to Earl Sather on November 15, 1934. Nevertheless Androff continued to fight, putting together the best stretch of his career when, between March 1935 and June 1938 he went 11-0-2, peaking with a ten-round points defeat of Fred Lenhart at Minneapolis on June 3, 1938. By then the quality of Androff's opponents had improved considerably, and his record thereafter attests to that fact, with Androff traveling to Los Angeles, Chicago, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Omaha, Houston, Fort Smith, Arkansas to compile a 6-12-4 record from that point to his retirement at the end of 1946. Aside from Lenhart, the most notable of Androff's opponents would be Joey Maxim, to whom he dropped a decision after ten rounds in June 1944.
When it was all over, Androff's professional record was 22 wins, 13 losses, and 7 draws, with 10 of his wins coming by knockout.

Les Sans Culottes

Les Sans Culottes is a French language rock band from Brooklyn, New York. They perform original material as well as covers of French rock songs and French-language reworkings of some classic American rock songs. Their name is a reference to the citizen soldiers of the French Revolution.
History.
The band was formed in 1998 by Clermont Ferrand after he travelled to France and developed a deep interest in French pop and yé-yé music of the 1960s, particularly artists such as Serge Gainsbourg, Françoise Hardy, France Gall, Jacques Dutronc and Nino Ferrer. The band made its debut in April 1998, at Freddy's Back Room, a neighborhood bar in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. The original lineup was singer-frontman Ferrand, vocalists Kit Kat Le Noir and Gigi Soleil, drummer Albert Camembert, bassist Jean Luc Retard, keyboardist Beau Pantalons, and guitarist Luc Panatalons - aka Le Marquis!. Retard quit following this first show (only to return the following year), thus inaugurating a long list of over 25 lineup changes over the next ten years. Vocalists Ferrand and Kit Kat Le Noir are the only remaining original members.
In 2005, the band's guitarist and drummer attempted to start another French language band with some former members and others and to call themselves "Les Sans Culottes". The original group brought a trademark infringement claim in Federal Court in Manhattan which resulted in a court order barring the new group from using the name of the original group. The new group eventually reformed as Nous Non Plus.
In June 2008 Les Sans Culottes embarked on a 10-city US tour with The Detroit Cobras.
In July 2009 the band played its first ever shows in France, performing at La Feline and L'Opa Bastille in Paris and at the 18th annual F'Estival des Musiques d'ici et d'ailleurs in Châlons-en-Champagne.
In October 2009, bassist Francoise Hardly (aka Jeanaté) left the band to join The Detroit Cobras and was replaced by Sid Vichyssoise.
In early October 2010, vocalist Edith Pissoff and guitarist Theo Neugent left the group. Pissoff was replaced by Courtney Louvre and Jean L'Effete returned to fill in for Neugent until a permanent replacement could be found. On May 2, 2011 the band played at The Bell House in Brooklyn with new guitarist Geddy Liaison and bassist Mr. Pomme Frittes, who replaced the departing Sid Vichyssoise.
Their song "Allo Allo - I love you" of the album "Fixation Orale" was selected as the background for Nexus S Ad (published on Dec 2010).
The band released '"Pataphysical Graffiti", its seventh album, in September 2011
In April 2012, Les Sans Culottes went on a 2 week tour of California. Shortly after the tour, Johnny Dieppe announced he was leaving the band to concentrate on composing. New keyboardist Benoit Bals made his debut on July 26, 2012.

List of FC Bayern Munich seasons

This is a list of the seasons played by Bayern Munich from 1905 when the club first entered a league competition to the most recent seasons. The club's achievements in all major national and international competitions as well as the top scorers are listed. Top scorers in bold were also top scorers of Bundesliga. The list is separated into three parts, coinciding with the three major episodes of German football:
Bayern has won the national championship 22 times, once before the inception of the Bundesliga and twenty-one times since. The club also won the DFB-Pokal 15 times, making them the record holder in number of cups and national championships won. Bayern won six international titles, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967, the UEFA Cup in 1996, the European Cup consecutively three times from 1974 to 1976, and the Champions League in 2001. They are the last club to have won the European Cup three times in a row.
The club has been relegated just once in 1955, but was promoted back to 1st division football the following season. Bayern was not appointed a spot in the Bundesliga at its inception and thus played two additional seasons in the 2nd division from 1963 to 1965.

The Birches (Garrison, New York)

The Birches is a house at the southeast corner of the junction of NY 9D and 403 in the hamlet of Garrison, New York, United States. It was built for William H. Osborn, as part of his nearby Wing & Wing estate, by architect Ralph Adams Cram in the Gothic Revival architectural style.
In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is just across Route 9D from the Garrison Grist Mill Historic District.
Building.
The first story is built of dressed, randomly coursed stone. It gives way to frame and a gambrel roof on the upper stories. A projecting, center-shingled pavilion on the west facade is trimmed in half-timber, coming to a louvered gable peak with its rafters intentionally exposed as decoration. A similarly decorated porch, with open gable, extends from the pavilion. The south profile has a one-story projecting bay supporting a balcony. The windows and doors on the first story have arched openings, echoed by a split rounded transom over the double-doored main entrance.
There is one outbuilding on the property: a one-story frame carriage house, later a garage, to the east. Two apartments have since been added to it.
History.
The Birches was designed in 1882 for William H. Osborn, owner of the nearby Wing & Wing estate. Within the Osborn family, it became known as the "Honeymoon House", since both William Church and Fairfield Osborn lived there after their weddings while waiting for their own nearby homes to be completed. When not used by them, it was occasionally home to the family's servants.
Due to this near-constant use, Osborn and his descendants never followed through on their plans to donate it to the Town of Philipstown (the town in which the hamlet of Garrison is located) for use as a public library (one was eventually built just across Route 403). So, when the family finally sold it in 1976, it remained in use as a house. It still is.
Aesthetics.
Cram's design, one of the earlier ones in his career, interpreted the Picturesque Gothic Revival cottages that Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers, following the patterns of their mentor, Andrew Jackson Downing, had built all over the Hudson Valley and, later, the country, three decades earlier, before the Civil War. The result was a late example of the Victorian Gothic style, distinct for a home in the area.
The stone coursework on the lower story links the house with other former Osborn properties in Garrison. Its style links it to the nearby Castle Rock, which can be seen over the house when it is viewed from the northwest, in the center of the intersection.

Aleppo soap

Aleppo soap (also known as savon d'Alep, laurel soap, Syrian soap, or ghar soap, the Syrian word for 'laurel') is a handmade, hard bar soap.
Aleppo soap is classified as a Castile soap as it is a hard soap made from olive oil and lye, from which it is distinguished by the inclusion of laurel oil.
History.
The origin of Aleppo soap is lost in time. Although claims of its great antiquity abound, such as references in the popular press to Egyptian Queen Cleopatra and Queen Zenobia of Syria using Aleppo soap, these claims have yet to be verified by Scholarly method. 
It is commonly thought that the process of soap-making emanated from the Levant region (of which Aleppo is a main city) and to have moved west from there to Europe after the first crusades based on the claim that the earliest soap made in Europe was just after the crusades, but in fact the Romans in the first century AD knew about soap and Zosimos of Panopolis ca. 300 AD described soap and soapmaking.
Today most Aleppo soap, especially that containing >16% of laurel oil, is exported to Europe and East Asia.
Manufacturing process.
Traditional Aleppo soap (Ghar) is made by the "hot process".
First, the olive oil is brought into a large, in-ground vat along with water and lye. Underneath the vat, there is an underground fire which heats the contents to a boil. Boiling lasts three days while the oil reacts with the lye and water to become a thick liquid soap.
The laurel oil is added at the end of the process, and after it is mixed in, the mix is taken from the vat and poured over a large sheet of waxed paper on the floor of the factory.
At this point the soap is a large, green, flat mass, and it is allowed to cool down and harden for about a day. While the soap is cooling, workers with planks of wood strapped to their feet walk over the soap to try to smooth out the batch and make it an even thickness.
The soap is then cut; three workers drag a rudimentary, rake-like cutting device through the soap to cut it one way, then again the other way until the whole mass is cut into individual cubes. Each cube is stamped with the soap artisan's name.
The cubes of soap are then stacked in staggered cylinders to allow maximum air exposure. Once they have dried sufficiently, they are put into a special subterranean chamber to be aged for six months to a year.
While it is aging, the soap goes through several chemical changes. First, and most importantly, the free alkaline content of the soap (the alkaline which did not react with the oil during saponification) breaks down upon slow reaction with air. The moisture content of the soap is also reduced, making the soap hard and long lasting. And lastly, the color of the outside of the soap turns a pale gold, while the inside remains green.
Modern Aleppo soaps are manufactured using a "cold process" and contain olive and laurel oils, and may contain a variety of herbs and/or essential oils.
Ingredients.
Traditional Aleppo soap is made with 100% natural, olive and laurel berry oils, water and lye
The relative concentration of laurel oil (typically from 2% - 30%) determines the quality and cost of the soap. 
In the 20th century, with the introduction of cold process soap making, Allepian soap artisans began introducing a variety of herbs and essential oils to their soaps.
Skin care properties.
Aleppo soap can be used daily as soap for washing and shampooing, as face mask, as shaving cream, and for bathing infants and babies.
The soap is effective against insect bites and is used for a variety of skin ailments such as skin allergies, irritated skin or conditions such as general dermatitis like eczema, psoriasis, bacterial dermatitis, acne, herpes, rosacea, it also helps prevent hair loss and it aids in the recovery of skin diseases.
Laurel oil is an effective cleanser, antibiotic, anti-fungal and anti-itching agent. Compounds extracted from Laurus Nobilis have recently been identified as an inhibitor of human melanoma (skin cancer) cell proliferation, as well as inhibiting other human tumor cell growths such as amelanotic melanoma, renal cell adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer cell lines.
Olive oil has been known for generations not only for its healing qualities but also as a natural, deep penetration moisturizer, regenerating skin cells and softening the tissue.
Unlike most soaps, Aleppo soap will float in water.
Environmental facts.
Aleppo soap is made from natural oils derived from the fruits of olive and laurel trees and is biodegradable.
Laurus nobilis is categorized as an "Underutilized Species".

La Patrouille des Castors

La Patrouille des Castors (The Beaver Patrol) is a series of Belgian comics drawn by MiTacq and written by Jean-Michel Charlier. 30 albums were published between 1955 and 1993, by Dupuis, all relating the adventures of a Scout patrol.
History.
This series, which was first published in "Spirou" magazine on November 25, 1954, relates the fictional adventures of a Scout patrol. In the first album, the patrol consisted of six Scouts, although one of them, Lapin (rabbit) disappeared quickly from future stories after the team decided five main characters was a more suitable number for the series. The artist, Michel Tacq (MiTacq), had himself been a Scout during a large part of his life. It was his idea to create a series with Scouts as the main characters, but he needed a script to realise the project, which was provided in 1954 by Charlier, already a very active scriptwriter. 
The publication in Spirou lasted from 1954 until 1979 although there was a long interruption from the beginning of 1967 until April 1971, after which publication was slower than it had been before 1967, because Charlier was then very busy with the several other series for which he was writing. Charlier was eventually replaced by Marc Wasterlain who wrote the scripts for two albums, and then, MiTacq took over as writer. Several albums only credit MiTacq as writer and artist, whereas in reality he was assisted either by Charlier, Wasterlain or his friend Jacques Stoquart.
Background.
The Beaver Patrol is a group of scouts who are taken on adventurous situations provided, most of the time, by their Scout camp during their holidays in foreign countries. As all Scouts should, they act honourably and charitably, but they face enigmas and puzzles in each region they visit in the best traditions of boys own adventures. Each character of the patrol has a very distinct profile, which makes it possible for them to have all the qualities needed in difficult situations.
As the series goes on, the graphic style evolves and the protagonists get older. They replaced their blue shirt (designed for 12 to 17 years-old boys) by a red shirt (made for Pioneers, 15 to 17 years-old scouts), according to the 1964 uniform reform for Belgian Scouts. Although "Spirou" magazine is Belgian, as well as the two creators of the series, its audience was primarily in France. During the course of the stories the Beavers left their native country often to travel to other countries and continents. Not only did the Beavers travel in various countries but the stories also took place in varied locations, be it underground, on the sea and even underwater.
The series was parodied by the author himself in a story written with Yvan Delporte with the series "La Patrouille des Zoms".
Characters.
The patrol is a built like an example of a perfect Scout troop, with each member having a totem and specific qualities:

All published by Dupuis:
All of these albums were collected in the collection "Tout MiTacq", consisting of 14 volumes published between 1989 and 1996 by Dupuis.

Merina Kingdom

The Merina Kingdom (ca. 1540–1897) was a pre-colonial southeastern African state that dominated most of what is now Madagascar. It spread outward from Imerina, the central highlands region primarily inhabited by the Merina ethnic group with a spiritual capital at Ambohimanga and a political capital west at Antananarivo, currently the seat of government for the modern democratic state of Madagascar. The Merina kings and queens who ruled over greater Madagascar in the 19th century were the descendants of a long line of hereditary Merina royalty, stretching back in oral traditions to such sources as the first human inhabitants of the island or the son of god himself.
History.
The Merina people are a group within the Malagasy culture of Madagascar for whom the kingdom is named. A strong caste tradition in many parts of Madagascar saw rulers emerge among diverse ethnic groups, typically from the noble class known as "andriana". Most notably, the Sakalava of the western coastal plains established a thriving kingdom based on maritime trade with European and Arab commercial ships and pirates that dates to at least the 16th century. The Merina lived within the island's central plateau called Imerina ("land seen from afar"). According to oral history, this land was originally inhabited by the Vazimba people, who were vanquished and largely expelled from the land by Merina king Andriamanelo in the 16th century, thereby establishing the Kingdom of Imerina.
A united and expanding Imerina was ruled by successors in his line. Political life on the island from the 16th century was characterised by sporadic conflict between the Merina and Sakalava kingdoms, originating with Sakalava slave-hunting incursions into Imerina. King Andriamasinavalona quartered the kingdom to be ruled by his four favourite sons, producing persistent fragmentation and warfare between principalities in Imerina. 
It was from this context in 1787 that Prince Ramboasalama, nephew of King Andrianjaka of Ambohimanga (one of the four kingdoms of Imerina) expelled his uncle and took the throne under the name Andrianampoinimerina. The new king used both diplomacy and force to reunite Imerina with the intent to bring all of Madagascar under his rule. This objective largely completed under his son, Radama I, who was the first to admit and regularly engage European missionaries and diplomats in Antananarivo.
The 33-year reign of Queen Ranavalona I, the widow of Radama I, was characterised by a struggle to preserve the cultural isolation of Madagascar from modernity, especially as represented by the French and British. Her son and heir, King Radama II, signed the unpopular Lambert Charter giving French entrepreneur Joseph-François Lambert exclusive rights to many of the island's resources. His liberal policies angered the aristocracy, however, and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony had the King strangled in a "coup d'état". This aristocratic revolution saw Rasoherina, the queen dowager, placed on the throne upon her acceptance of a constitutional monarchy that gave greater power to the Prime Minister. She replaced the incumbent Prime Minister with his brother, Rainilaiarivony, who retained the role until the Kingdom's collapse and married each successive queen. The next sovereign, Ranavalona II, converted the nation to Christianity and had all the "sampy" (ancestral royal talismans) burnt in a public display. The last Merina sovereign, Queen Ranavalona III, acceded the throne at age 22 and was exiled to Réunion Island and later French Algeria following French colonisation of the island in 1896.
French colonisation.
Angry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property taken from French citizens, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the First Franco-Hova War ("Hova" referring to the "andriana"). At the war’s end, Madagascar ceded Antsiranana (Diégo Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 gold francs to the heirs of Joseph-François Lambert. Meanwhile in Europe, diplomats partitioning the African continent worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to obtain the Sultanate of Zanzibar, ceded its rights over Heligoland to the German Empire and renounced all claims to Madagascar in favour of France. The agreement augured ill for the primitive monarchy of Madagascar. Prime Minister Rainilaiarivory had succeeded in playing Great Britain and France against one another, but now France could meddle without fear of reprisals from Britain.
In 1895, a French flying-column landed in Mahajanga (Majunga) and marched by way of the Betsiboka River to the capital, Antananarivo, taking the city’s defenders by surprise since they had expected an attack from the much closer eastern coast. Twenty French soldiers died in combat while 6,000 died of malaria and other diseases before the Second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896, the Merina Kingdom was put under French protection as the Malagasy Protectorate and in 1897 the French Parliament voted to annexe the island as a colony, effectively ending Merina sovereignty.

Diesel engines.
In 1896 they built lamp start oil engines. By 1912 they had developed a new internal combustion engine that ran on vaporizing oil and was fired by a spark. It did not need a hot bulb like most engines of the time. By 1919 they had mounted a 25 hp 3 cylinder version in a crawler tractor, which they built till 1925.
By 1929 they were building diesel engines for the Agricultural & General Engineers (AGE) group. Richard Garrett & Sons assembled some of these tractors. They were similar to an International 15/30.
AGE collapsed in 1932.
Mergers.
After the collapse of AGE, Blackstone & Co. continued as an engine builder and was taken over by R A Lister and Company in 1937 to form Lister Blackstone.
Hawker Siddeley.
R A Lister & Company was taken over by the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1965 and, in a later re-organisation, Lister became Lister Petter and Blackstone became Mirrlees Blackstone.
Closure.
Mirrlees Blackstone were bought by MAN Diesel, along with the diesel businesses of the collapsed GEC, although little remains. The Stockport factory has been partly demolished and replaced with a new office and warehouse facility which still serves the aftermarket for spares and servicing of Lister Blackstone engines under the MAN Diesel & Turbo tagline.

Face the Facts

Face the Facts is a consumer affairs programme on BBC Radio 4, featuring investigative journalism, that has been running since the mid-1980s. Currently introduced by John Waite, cousin of the well-known humanitarian and churchman Terry Waite, it usually focuses on individuals or organisations within the UK or Europe thought to be corrupt, engaged in malpractice or active criminality. The programme has imitated (and been imitated by) similar investigation shows in the UK, including the very similar "The Cook Report" (1985-98) on ITV.
In 2008 the show received the Radio Documentary Award from the One World Broadcasting Trust (OWBT) organisation. The award was given for "Lost in Translation", which OWM described as "a hard-hitting documentary about the use of local translators by British forces in Iraq, the dangers that those translators faced, and the lack of support from the people who hired them."

Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad

The Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad was a 197.9 mile railroad built by William A. Clark that ran northwest from a connection with the mainline of the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad at Las Vegas, Nevada to the gold mines at Goldfield. The SPLA&SL railroad later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad and serves as their mainline between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.
History.
In April 1905, Clark made a verbal agreement with Francis Marion Smith that Smith could build a rail line to his borax operations at Lila C connecting with the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad at Las Vegas. After Smith's men had already graded 12 miles for tracks, his workers received a no trespassing order that they were not allowed to connect with Clark's rail. Clark had apparently changed his mind, and subsequently, he laid his own rail on the line graded by Smith's men. In response, Smith started his own competing railroad, the Tonopah and Tidewater to the Goldfield boomotowns in direct competition with Clark.
The Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad was incorporated on September 22, 1905. On March 1, 1906, the track was completed between Las Vegas and Indian Springs. By June 30, 1906, the line was over 50% completed (), reaching Rose's Well. In December 1906 the tracks reached Rhyolite. Finally, in November 1907 the entire line was in operation between Las Vegas and Goldfield.
The northern end of the line (Beatty - Goldfield) was only in operation from 1908 - 1914. That of track was removed during World War I. The Las Vegas & Tonopah continued to serve the Bullfrog Mining District at Beatty until 1917/1918. By 1919, the remaining of track was abandoned and scrapped.
Operations.
In 1906 the trip from Las Vegas to Beatty took 6 hours. Trains operated daily until February 1, 1917, and then became tri-weekly until abandonement.
The railroad had three passenger cars. One of them, a Harriman type chair car #30, was built in 1907 by the Pullman Company, is awaiting restoration at the Nevada State Railroad Museum.
The LV&T depot at Rhyolite still remains. It was constructed in 1909 at a cost of $130,000.
Locomotives.
The railroad primarily used "Ten Wheeler" 4-6-0 and Consolidation (2-8-0) type locomotives, primarily manufactured by Brooks and Baldwin Locomotive Works. The railroad's first four locomotives were purchased in used condition. The railroad would later purchase 12 additional new locomotives. Upon abandonment of the railroad in 1917/1918, these locomotives were sold to the Northwestern Pacific Railroad, the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad and the San Diego and Arizona Railway.
Preservation.
All that is known to still exist of the once extensive rolling stock of the LV&T, one coach has been preserved by the Nevada Northern Railroad Museum but sadly it has not yet been refurbished and still awaits restoration to this very day.

Love &amp; War (TV series)

Love & War is an American television sitcom, which aired on CBS from September 21, 1992 to February 1, 1995.
Created by Diane English, the series originally starred Susan Dey as Wally Porter, a Chicago restaurateur, and Jay Thomas as Jack Stein, a sportswriter with whom she had an on-again, off-again romance.
After the first season, however, the show was retooled and Dey was fired by the producers of the show, claiming that she and Thomas had "no chemistry" together. She was replaced by Annie Potts as Dana Palladino, who bought Porter's restaurant and also became a love interest for Jack.
The first season also featured moments when Jack or Wally would break the fourth wall and address the camera directly, generally using it as an opportunity to discuss an emotional crisis. This mechanic was dropped in later seasons.
One episode featured a guest appearance from Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David as themselves, they did this as a "thank you" to creator Diane English for allowing a brief scene on "Murphy Brown" in an episode of "Seinfeld" where Kramer is cast as the titular character's secretary.
The show's supporting cast included Suzie Plakson, Joanna Gleason, Joel Murray, Charles Robinson and Michael Nouri. John Hancock, who had a recurring role as a judge on "L.A. Law" with Susan Dey previously, portrayed bartender Ike for the first half of season one, until he died of a heart attack in late 1992. His death was subsequently written into the series and he was replaced by actor Charlie Robinson.
Scheduling.
In its first two and a half seasons, the show aired on Monday nights following another Diane English production, "Murphy Brown". Midway through its third season, it was moved to Wednesday nights where ratings sagged, leading to its cancellation.
Awards and nominations.
Potts was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress - Comedy Series in 1994, but lost to Candice Bergen. Guest stars Tracey Ullman and Eileen Heckart won Emmies for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 1993 and 1994, respectively, while Sid Caesar was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 1995, but did not win.
The show was also a nominee for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music in 1993.

Yang Yun (gymnast)

Yang Yun (; born December 2, 1984 in Zhuzhou, Hunan) is a Chinese gymnast. She won the bronze medal on the uneven bars at the 2000 Summer Olympics along with a fifth place finish in the all around, where a fall off the balance beam (a five tenth deduction) cost her the gold medal, finishing less than three and a half tenths behind eventual champion Simona Amânar of Romania. She was also a member of the bronze medal winning Chinese team, but the medal was stripped by the IOC in 2010 after one of the Chinese team members was found to be underage during the competition.
Currently, Yang Yun is a CCTV reporter. She is wife of Chinese gymnast Yang Wei.
Age Controversy.
After Yang Yun admitted being 14 when she competed in Sydney on Chinese national television, she was subject to an investigation by the International Gymnastics Federation along with teammate Dong Fangxiao. Yang Yun was found to be innocent due to insufficient evidence in February 2010, meaning she was able to keep her bronze medal in uneven bars, but she was given a warning by the FIG. Her teammate Dong Fangxiao was found guilty and her results were canceled. On April 28, 2010, the IOC removed the Chinese team's bronze medal.

The 1975 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships were held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the second time, having hosted them in 1971. This also equaled the most times a city had done so with Copenhagen, Denmark (1950, 1970).
The men's competition consisted of six Canadian (single paddle, open boat) and nine kayak events. Three events were held for the women, all in kayak.
This was the twelfth championships in canoe sprint. It marked the first time in the championships' history in which there was tie for a medal and that happened to be for the gold in the men's K-1 1000 m event between Italy's Oreste Perri and Poland's Grzegorz Śledziewski. The second would occur thirty-five years later in the C-1 200 m (debutted 1994) for the bronze between Canada's Richard Dalton and Ukraine's Yuriy Cheban, neither of who were born in 1975.

Rekonstruktionslokomotive

The German term Rekonstruktionslokomotive (abbreviated to: Rekolokomotive or Rekolok) meant 'reconstruction locomotive' and was introduced in 1957 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the GDR. 
The term was used for classes of steam locomotive that underwent considerable rebuilding in order to improve performance, rectify design faults and redress wartime austerity features. At the same time, repairs were carried out. The 'reconstruction' included, as a minimum, the installation of a new high performance steam generation system. Consequently, a characteristic feature of these "Rekoloks" is a combustion chamber boiler with rectangular mixing chamber ("Mischkasten") in front of the chimney.
On individual classes (Class 58.30), completely new driver's cabs were built, instead of just fitting the new end walls needed after the boiler had been replaced. The worn cast cylinder blocks were sometimes replaced by welded cylinders. Unlike the Deutsche Bundesbahn's conversion programme, the boilers were not matched to the individual locomotive classes, but the locomotives were matched to the new boilers. The price paid for the easy interchangeability of the steam generation system thus achieved, was the extensive changes now required to the locomotive frame. 
Also reconstructed were selected vehicles of those locomotive classes that could not be done away with and from which a long period of operational life was expected.
The first "Rekolok", number 50 3501, left Stendal Reichsbahn repair shop ("Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk" or "RAW"), which had carried out the work, on 12 November 1957. The first "Reko" 50, from then on designated as Class 50.35, was assigned to Güsten locomotive shed ("Bahnbetriebswerk" or "Bw"). With the delivery of 01 535 by "RAW Meiningen" on 31 May 1965 the "Reko" programme was initially declared as finished, but in fact it wasn't. For in 1968 the state and party leadership of the GDR tasked the Reichsbahn, to produce a strategic reserve of 45 Class 03 express train locomotives with an 18 ton average axle load. From 1968 to 1972, not just the required 45, but as many as 52 locomotives of this class were fitted with "Reko" boilers in "RAW Meiningen" from the largely retired Class 22 (formerly Class 39, Prussian P 10) engines. The Class 58.30 "Rekolokomotives" were, due to their age and the very extensive repairs and work required on the donor vehicles, the most expensive conversions of the whole programme.
The following normal gauge steam locomotive classes were reconstructed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and regrouped into a new class or sub-class:
and as individual vehicles for experimental testing and, sometimes, trials equipment platforms:
The "VES-M Halle" in Halle (Saale) was responsible for the reconstruction programme

Martin Pugh

Martin Pugh is a British guitarist who came to prominence after joining blues-rock band Steamhammer in 1968, staying with that band through 5 years and 4 albums. The debut Steamhammer album, also known as Steamhammer, was released in 1969 and yielded a minor hit record in Europe, Junior's Wailing. Pugh also played on the first Rod Stewart solo album, along with fellow Steamhammer guitarist Martin Quittenton.
He later joined Armageddon in 1975 with former Yardbirds vocalist Keith Relf. According to liner notes of a CD re-release of their only album on the Repertoire label in 1999, drug problems interfered with the band's work ethic, despite the record having received favorable reviews and significant radio airplay upon its release. Their demise was finalized after the untimely death of Keith Relf in May 1976.
While he appears to have retired from music after 1975, he did emerge to play guitar on sessions with Hawaii-based rock & roll band, 7th Order on their debut CD, The Lake of Memory - released on the Big Island Sounds label in 2007.

1 Ilica Street

1 Ilica Street () is a building located in Ilica Street overlooking Ban Jelačić Square in the Lower Town area of Zagreb, Croatia. In Croatian, the building was known under the generic title Neboder (lit. Skyscraper) as it was the first business skyscraper in the country, but this use is today obsolete.
The building, designed by the trio of Slobodan Jovičić, Josip Hitil and Ivan Žuljević, was built between 1957 and 1958 and was officially inaugurated on 22 August 1959, when Većeslav Holjevac was mayor of Zagreb. It was the tallest building in Yugoslavia at the time of its completion, and it was the first building in the country which featured an aluminium façade (aluminium sheets for the building were manufactured at the Utva aircraft factory in Pančevo). Other notable high-rises built earlier in Zagreb include the nine-story modernist Löwy Building built in 1933 and the so-called "Wooden Skyscraper" designed by Drago Ibler - but since they were both residential buildings which resembled skyscrapers in design but not in function or size, the sixteen-story 1 Ilica Street is regarded as the first "bonafide skyscraper" built in Zagreb and Yugoslavia.
The principal investors were Končar and Ferimport, two large state-owned companies. The building later housed Ferimport offices, but it also featured an observation deck and a restaurant on its top floor (later converted into a short-lived disco club in the early 1990s) and a small shopping arcade which was built around the base of the building, connecting Ilica, Gajeva, Bogovićeva and Petrićeva streets. The observation deck was open to the public for decades, but it was fenced by security railings in 1967 after a man committed suicide by jumping off it and landing on a woman passing by, who was also killed.
On 29 November 1970 (Yugoslav Republic Day), political activists Zvonko and Julienne Bušić used the observation deck to throw leaflets advocating Croatian independence, for which they were arrested. (They later went on to hijack a TWA airliner in 1976 with the intention of convincing the international media into publishing a similar leaflet.)
Ferimport later experienced a dramatic downturn in the 1990s after it was privatized in the years following Croatia's independence and the fall of communism, and the building visibly deteriorated in this period.
In 2001, three years after Ferimport had entered administration, it was sold for 6 million euros to Peter Doimi de Frankopan, a British real estate investor who claimed lineage to the House of Frankopan, a Croatian aristocratic family thought to be extinct in the 17th century. Frankopan had plans for a large scale reconstruction of the building, but the initial concept (which entailed a complete redesign of the façade and the addition of panoramic elevators, spiral staircases and a few extra floors), was rejected by the city's institute for the protection of cultural heritage. The project was then delayed for four years until a revised renovation plan was finally approved by city authorities in December 2005.
Following the approval, renovation was finally launched in 2006 and was finished in early 2008. The project was designed by the Aukett Fitzroy Robinson interior design practice in collaboration with the Zagreb-based architecture studio Proarh, and the actual work was done by the Strabag construction company. The most significant change in the exterior was the replacement of the originally clear windows with dark gray glass. The building currently has 5,600 m2 of office space, and the observation deck on the top floor was closed to the public in 2007.
It was reopened in 2013 as "Zagreb Eye".

2008–09 Rugby Pro D2 season

The 2008–09 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, in the 2008–09 season. It ran alongside the 2008–09 Top 14 competition; both competitions were operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).
Previous season.
At the end of the previous season, Toulon were champions and thus automatically promoted to Top 14. They were eventually followed by Mont-de-Marsan, who beat Racing Métro in extra time in the final providing the second promotion place. Blagnac, which had been newly promoted to Pro D2 for the 2007–08 season, finished bottom of the table and were initially relegated to Fédérale 1, but were further relegated by French sporting authorities to Fédérale 2 due to financial problems. Limoges finished second-from-bottom for the second consecutive year; unlike 2006–07, when Limoges were reprieved when Gaillac were denied a professional license due to financial issues, they received no such break in 2007–08. The other promoted team in 2007–08, Aurillac, stayed up, finishing in 11th.
Colomiers and Bourg-en-Bresse earned promotion from Fédérale 1 for the 2008–09 season, while Albi and Auch were relegated from the 2007–08 Top 14.
2008–09 synopsis.
Racing Métro, which had barely missed out on promotion the previous season, easily won the title, clinching with three rounds to spare. The three promotion playoff games were decided by a total of 5 points, with the semifinal between Albi and La Rochelle being tied after extra time and decided on the third step of the tiebreaker, penalties scored during the match. Albi ultimately defeated Oyonnax in the final to secure an immediate return to the Top 14.
The two newly promoted teams, Colomiers and Bourg-en-Bresse, were in relegation trouble throughout the season, but Colomiers escaped, finishing in 14th, the last safe spot. Bourg-en-Bresse were provisionally joined in relegation by Béziers.
However, this did not end the relegation saga. In order to keep a professional license and stay in Pro D2, all clubs must pass a postseason audit conducted by DNACG ("Direction nationale d'aide et de contrôle de gestion"), the LNR's financial arm. On June 12, DNACG announced that Tarbes and Bourg-en-Bresse had failed their audits and would be relegated. Tarbes would be relegated to Fédérale 1, while Bourg-en-Bresse, already consigned to Fédérale 1, would face a further drop to Fédérale 2. Béziers would have been spared the drop if Tarbes had not successfully appealed its relegation. However, Tarbes were able to come up with sufficient financial guarantees to satisfy DNACG, and its relegation to Fédérale 1 was officially rescinded on June 26.
The competition.
The LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also makes it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for 2008–09.
France's bonus point system operates as follows:

Maillé massacre

The Maillé Massacre refers to the murder on 25 August 1944 of 124 of the 500 residents of the commune of Maillé in the department of the Indre-et-Loire. Following an ambush a few days before and in reprisals against activities of the French Resistance, Second Lieutenant Gustav Schlüter and his men organized the massacre and burnt the village. Forty-eight children were among the dead. The SS unit believed to be responsible for the massacre is the SS-Feldersatzbataillon 17 of 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen (Lieb, 2007). In contrast to Oradour-sur-Glane, the village was rebuilt after the war to its pre-war state (Delahousse, 2008).
Development of events.
On the evening of August 24, 1944, skirmishes between the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) and German troops took place near a farm in the commune of Maillé. Gustave Schlüter, commander of the German control post at Sainte-Maure-de-Touraine, mobilized his men and two train-mounted artillery pieces(Chevereau & Forlivesi, 2005; Delahousse, 2008; Payon, 1945; Lieb, 2007).
The next morning, Maillé was closed off by German forces. One artillery piece was destroyed by the attacking RAF. The first farms were then set on fire and their residents killed. About noon, the SS entered the village and the systematic killing began. Some wounded who had pretended to be dead, were later shot down when they attempted to escape (Chevereau & Forlivesi, 2005; Delahousse, 2008; Payon, 1945).
About 1:00 pm the artillery bombardment began, demolishing the village and any who might have survived the initial onslaught. The soldiers were also there to ensure that survivors were shot on sight. By late afternoon calm returned, and the few survivors could only look upon the spectacle with sadness. The intervention of abbot André Payon was needed so that they could leave to take shelter in neighboring villages.
In less than four hours, whole families were slaughtered by the SS, many of whose soldiers were only 16 and 17 years old (Chevereau & Forlivesi, 2005; Delahousse, 2008; Payon, 1945).
Commemoration.
The principal bibliographic resources are the memoirs of abbot André Payon, published for many years by the "Conseil Général" of the Indre-et-Loire (Payon, 1945).
Since March 9, 2006, a memorial museum Maison du Souvenir has been open to the general public in the Café Métais, in Maillé. The museum shows collections of photos and artifacts commemorating the village of Maillé and those killed during the massacre (Chevereau & Forlivesi, 2005; Delahousse, 2008; Payon, 1945). A German study on German anti-partisan warfare in France during the Second World War revealed some new facts on the possible SS perpetrators (Lieb, 2007).
War crime prosecution.
Gustav Schlüter was condemned "in absentia" in Bordeaux in 1953, yet he died peacefully at his home in Germany in 1965 (Chevereau & Forlivesi, 2005; Delahousse, 2008; Payon, 1945).
On August 1, 2005, the public prosecutor of Dortmund, Ulrich Maass, reopened the inquiry, resulting in a visit to Maillé in July 2008. It was clarified that Germany has no statute of limitations on war crimes, and German judicial system reserves the right of initiative in such cases.

Field theory (psychology)

Field theory is a psychological theory which examines patterns of interaction between the individual and the total field, or environment. The concept was developed by Kurt Lewin, a Gestalt psychologist, in the 1940s.
Field theory holds that behavior must be derived from a totality of coexisting facts. These coexisting facts make up a "dynamic field", which means that the state of any part of the field depends on every other part of it. Behavior depends on the present field rather than on the past or the future.

The design originated in a seal of the late 14th century and therefore predated the setting up of the College of Heralds in 1484 and also the order of King Henry V in 1417, which disallowed the bearing of arms without authority from the Crown. The wavy bars of black and gold represent the sea and the dolphin "the king of the sea", just as the lion represents "king of the beasts". The dolphin was a sign of Poole's maritime interests. The three scallop shells are the symbol of St James and associated with the shrine of Santiago de Compostela reputed burial place of St James, apostle of Jesus Christ. Santiago de Compostela was a popular destination for Christian pilgrims departing from Poole Harbour in the Middle Ages. St James is the Patron Saint of the Parish Church in Poole.
The arms were confirmed by the College of Arms on June 19, 1948, with the colours officially recorded for the first time. At the same time the crest, a mermaid supporting an anchor and holding a cannon ball was granted. The crest had in fact been in use since the 18th century. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the 1948 arms were transferred to the present Poole Borough Council. In 1976 the borough council received the grant of supporters, the figures on either side of the shield. The supporters were a gift from Oscar Murton, the then Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons to commemorate his period of service as a Councillor and MP for Poole.
The supporters refer to Poole's main charters, to the left is a gold lion holding a long sword. This represents William Longespee, Lord of the Manor who in 1248 granted the town's first charter. The other supporter on the right is a dragon which is derived from the Royal Arms of Elizabeth I in who granted Poole county corporate status in a 1568 charter. The royal dragon is coloured red, but that granted to Poole was altered to gold for heraldic difference. The dragon holds a silver oar. This is part of the civic regalia of the Mayor of Poole, representing his additional title "Admiral of the Port of Poole". Since 1976 the dolphin has been depicted naturalistically rather than heraldically.
Blazon.
The Latin motto - "Ad Morem Villae De Poole" means, "According to the Custom of the Town of Poole", and comes from the town's Great Charter of 1568.

Just Say Yes (Punchline album)

Just Say Yes is an album by the pop punk band Punchline, first announced in April 2008 with a release date of September 16, 2008. It is the follow-up to "37 Everywhere", released in 2006. Tracks 1-5, 7, 9 and 10 of the album were recorded at Room Sound Studios in Tempe, Arizona, with the producer Jamie Woolford (formerly of The Stereo, now a member of the band Let Go). The remaining tracks were recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with Sean O'Keefe, who previously produced Punchline's "Action" album.
As an incentive to the first 500 who pre-ordered "Just Say Yes", a four song disc titled "Just Say Maybe" was shipped with their order. "Just Say Maybe" has different versions of album songs as well as songs that were not included on the album. On November 1, Punchline gave away the album for free with some limited bonus tracks for Steve Soboslai's 28th birthday and Halloween.
"Just Say Yes" was the first release on the independent label Modern Short Stories, founded by Soboslai.

Sodium channel blocker

Sodium channel blockers are agents that impair conduction of sodium ions (Na+) through sodium channels.
Extracellular.
The following naturally produced substances block sodium channels by binding to and occluding the extracellular pore opening of the channel:
Intracellular.
Drugs which block sodium channels by blocking from the intracellular side of the channel include:
Antiarrhythmic.
Sodium channel blockers are used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. They are classified as "Type I" in the Vaughan Williams classification.
Class I antiarrhythmic agents interfere with the (Na+) channel.
Class I agents are grouped by their effect on the Na+ channel, and by their effect on cardiac action potentials.
Class I agents are called Membrane Stabilizing Agents. 'Stabilizing' refers to the decrease of excitogenicity of the plasma membrane effected by these agents. A few class II agents, propranolol for example, also have a membrane stabilizing effect.
Class Ia agents.
Class Ia agents block the fast sodium channel, which depresses the phase 0 depolarization (i.e. reduces Vmax), which prolongs the action potential duration by slowing conduction.
Agents in this class also cause decreased conductivity and increased refractoriness.
Indications for Class Ia agents are supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, symptomatic ventricular premature beats, and prevention of ventricular fibrillation.
Procainamide can be used to treat atrial fibrillation in the setting of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and to treat wide complex hemodynamically stable tachycardias. Oral procainamide is no longer being manufactured in the US, but intravenous formulations are still available.
While procainamide and quinidine may be used in the conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm, they should only be used in conjunction with an AV node blocking agent such as digoxin or verapamil, or a beta blocker), because procainamide and quinidine can increase the conduction through the AV node and may cause 1:1 conduction of atrial fibrillation, causing an increase in the ventricular rate.
Class Ia agents include quinidine, procainamide and disopyramide.
Class Ib agents.
Class Ib antiarrhythmic agents are sodium channel blockers. They have fast onset and offset kinetics, meaning that they have little or no effect at slower heart rates, and more effects at faster heart rates. Class Ib agents shorten the action potential duration and reduce refractoriness. These agents will decrease Vmax in partially depolarized cells with fast response action potentials. They either do not change the action potential duration, or they may decrease the action potential duration. Class Ib drugs tend to be more specific for voltage gated Na channels than Ia. Lidocaine in particular is highly frequency dependent, in that it has more activity with increasing heart rates. This is because lidocaine selectively blocks Na channels in their open and inactive states and has little binding capability in the resting state.
Class Ib agents are indicated for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and symptomatic premature ventricular beats, and prevention of ventricular fibrillation.
Class Ib agents include lidocaine, mexiletine, tocainide, and phenytoin.
Class Ic agents.
Class Ic antiarrhythmic agents markedly depress the phase 0 depolarization (decreasing Vmax). They decrease conductivity, but have a minimal effect on the action potential duration. Of the sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic agents (the class I antiarrhythmic agents), the class Ic agents have the most potent sodium channel blocking effects.
Class Ic agents are indicated for life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and for the treatment of refractory supraventricular tachycardia (i.e. atrial fibrillation). These agents are potentially pro-arrhythmic, especially in settings of structural heart disease (e.g. post-myocardial infarction), and are contraindicated in such settings.
Class Ic agents include encainide, flecainide, moricizine, and propafenone. Encainide is not available in the US.
Other uses.
Sodium channel blockers are also used as local anesthetics and epilepsy treatments.
Sodium channel blockers have been proposed for use in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, but current evidence is mixed.
It has been suggested that the analgesic effect of some antidepressants is due to sodium channel blockade.

Potassium channel blocker

Potassium channel blockers are agents which interfere with conduction through potassium channels.
Arrhythmia.
Potassium channel blockers used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia are classified as class III antiarrhythmic agents.
Mechanism.
Class III agents predominantly block the potassium channels, thereby prolonging repolarization. More specifically, their primary effect is on IKr. 
Since these agents do not affect the sodium channel, conduction velocity is not decreased. The prolongation of the action potential duration and refractory period, combined with the maintenance of normal conduction velocity, prevent re-entrant arrhythmias. (The re-entrant rhythm is less likely to interact with tissue that has become refractory).
Class III antiarrhythmic agents exhibit reverse use dependent prolongation of the action potential duration (Reverse use-dependence). This means that the refractoriness of the ventricular myocyte increases at lower heart rates. This increases the susceptibility of the myocardium to Early Afterdepolarizations (EADs) at low heart rates. Antiarrhythmic agents that exhibit reverse use-dependence are more efficacious at preventing a tachyarrhythmia than converting someone into normal sinus rhythm. "Because of the reverse use-dependence of class III agents, at low heart rates class III antiarrhythmic agents may paradoxically be more arrhythmogenic."
Side effects.
These agents include a risk of torsades de pointes.
Anti-diabetics.
Sulfonylureas come under the class of ATP-sensitive potassium channel blockers.
Other uses.
Dalfampridine, A potassium channel blocker has also been approved for use in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

Harriman-Jewell Series

The Harriman-Jewell Series (originally known as the "William Jewell College Fine Arts Program"), is a performing arts presentation organization founded in 1965, and based in Kansas City, Missouri.
Originally known as the "William Jewell College Fine Arts Program", it hosted Luciano Pavarotti's international recital debut on February 1, 1973. Held in William Jewell College’s John Gano Memorial Chapel, Pavarotti was perspiring due to nerves and a lingering cold. The tenor clutched a handkerchief throughout the debut, which became a signature part of his solo performances. Over the years, Pavarotti sang five recitals for the organization.
The Series has since hosted several leading tenors, including Giuseppe Filianoti (2012), Francisco Araiza (1982), Ben Heppner (1997), Marcelo Álvarez (2001), Juan Diego Flórez (2002), Daniil Shtoda (2002), Salvatore Licitra (2005), and Clifton Forbis (2006).
New York City Ballet’s Patricia McBride and Edward Villella danced in the Series’ first performance in December 1965, and violinist Itzhak Perlman played a recital in 1971.
The organisation hosts a variety of free discovery concerts, and events that allow interaction with musicians and dancers.
The organisation also makes the performing arts an integral part of the college curriculum for William Jewell College students. Among the oldest colleges west of the Mississippi River, William Jewell was named TIME Magazine's "Liberal Arts College of the Year" for 2001-2002.
“Cezanne called the Louvre ‘the book in which we learn to read,’” said Terry Teachout, a Jewell alumnus and drama critic for the Wall Street Journal. “The Harriman program was the book in which I learned to see, hear, and love the performing arts. It gave me a golden yardstick of taste–-one I still use to this day.”
“No one will ever be able to calculate how the presence of some of the world’s most superb artists before area innocents influenced the development of resident music, dance and theater companies,” the Kansas City Star wrote of the Harriman-Jewell Series. “What Harriman has done...has multiplied in countless, wonderful ways.”

Tycho Kielland (25 March 1854 - 3 May 1904) was a Norwegian jurist and journalist.
He was born in Stavanger to Jens Zetlitz Kielland (1816-1881) and his wife Christine (1820–1862), née Lange. His grandfather was Jacob Kielland, and an uncle was also named Jacob Kielland. Through his uncle Jacob, Tycho was the cousin of diplomat Axel Christian Zetlitz Kielland, mayor Jonas Schancke Kielland and others. He had four brothers and three sisters, most of them older than he was, although two died young. His oldest brother Jacob became a priest and politician, his oldest sister Kitty became a painter while Alexander became a highly successful novelist. His sister Dagmar married Olaf Skavlan.
Tycho Kielland enrolled in law studies in 1874, and graduated as cand.jur. in 1879. From 1880 he had a career in the Ministry of Auditing. In 1888 he moved to Kristiania and bought Norsk Telegrambureau (NTB), the leading news agency in Norway.
In December 1884 he married Anne Marie Vilhelmine Schlytter (1862-1924) daughter of Johan Christian Schlytter and Sophie Magdalene Manthey. In 1887 the couple had their only child; a son named Fritz who did not lead a distinguished life.
Tycho Kielland committed suicide in 1904. His widow Anne took over as director of NTB, and ran the bureau until 1918 when the media companies took over in a joint ownership.

Lykes Brothers Steamship Company

Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., also called Lykes Lines, was a cargo shipping company acting from the beginning of the 20th century to 2005 having its main business in the trade to and from the United States. 
History.
In 1900 the sons of Dr. Howell Tyson Lykes started a shipping business by using a 109-foot, 75 ton three-masted schooner to ship cattle to Cuba as a replacement for herds which were wiped out in the Spanish-American War. The tradition of naming their ships after family members dates back to that time, when this schooner was named "Doctor Lykes" after their father. Three years later, an office was opened in Galveston, Texas, and Lykes began offering general cargo transportation between the US Gulf and Caribbean ports.
In 1922 the "Lykes Bros. Steamship Co." was set up as a separate company, owned by the Lykes Brothers. The seven brothers had been trading cotton, lumber and grain for years so owning their own ships was a natural extension of their operations. During the 1920s Lykes began to range beyond the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. Offices were opened in Europe, and routes were extended to the Mediterranean and Far East.
The 1930s saw Lykes acquiring 52 ships from Dixie and Southern States Lines, giving them a fleet of 67 ships. After passage of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, they committed themselves to the replacement of their fleet with modern freighters. Sixteen had been delivered by December 1941, when the US entered World War II. During the war, Lykes carried 60 million tons of cargo and operated a maximum of 125 cargo ships for the government. 22 ships were lost along with 272 lives. 
During the postwar years, Lykes returned to commercial activity. By the 1950s, it had a fleet of 54 ships totaling 568,978 deadweight tons. That fleet underwent a complete replacement between 1960 and 1973, when 41 new ships were built. 
By then, Lykes steamship had become a subsidiary of Lykes Corp., which in 1978 merged with LTV Corp. In 1983 Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc. was purchased by Interocean Steamship Corp., a Florida corporation whose stockholders included descendants of the original seven Lykes brothers. 
With the start of containerization, Lykes was soon participating, becoming a container carrier in the trade lanes of the United States East and Gulf coasts, North Europe, the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean region, Mexico and Africa. Being registered in the U.S., the company had the privilege of being allowed to transport cargo for the U.S. Army.
In December 1994 the company moved its headquarters from New Orleans, LA to Tampa, FL (to the former First Florida Tower (currently the Park Tower) at 400 North Tampa Street). The general offices were later moved to the SunTrust Tower at 401 East Jackson Street in Tampa. In October 1995, the company filed for chapter 11 reorganization. On February 24, 1997, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Alexander Paskay approved a bid by CP Ships, Ltd. to buy Lykes Brothers Steamship Co. In the following years, CP Ships integrated the services of Ivaran Lines which they bought up in May 1998 and Christensen Canadian African Lines (CCAL) which was acquired in August 2000 into the Lykes Lines brand.
In late 2005 the Lykes Lines brand was replaced by the CP Ships brand following CP's one brand strategy promoted by the "One brand - One team" project. CP Ships itself was bought up by TUI AG and merged in mid-2006 in the Hapag-Lloyd organization.
In literature.
John McPhee's "Looking for a Ship" (1990), a report on the state of the US Merchant Marine, centers on a South American voyage on the Lykes Brothers freighter "Stella Lykes".
The shipping company is referred to in the Tom Clancy novel "Red Storm Rising".

19th Street Bridge

19th Street Bridge is a two-span through Pratt truss road bridge in Denver, Colorado, over the South Platte River, now used for pedestrians. It was built in 1888 to replace a wooden structure and carried automobile traffic until 1986. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
A number of bridges were built across the South Platte River beginning in 1859, and by 1875, there was interest in a bridge to span the river at the 19th Street location. In 1876, a wooden bridge was constructed at the site. This previous bridge was closed to traffic in 1884 after it was damaged in a flood. Because of repeated floods destroying numerous wooden bridges, the city of Denver sought to replace them with metal structures. By 1887, because of their ready availability and low expense, the city began building metal bridges to replace the wooden spans. On August 26, 1887, the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Works was contracted to build the 19th Street Bridge. The structure cost $25,000, including $8,250 for of iron. Construction on the new span was complete in 1888.
Around 1898, a plan surfaced to rebuild the bridge as a viaduct so that it would not cross only the river, but also the rail switching yard. However, the plan was defeated in June 1904. The bridge has remained mostly unmodified since construction. Timber decking was replaced with corrugated steel following a 1961 flood and some bent hinges were replaced as a result of a 1965 flood. The 19th Street Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 4, 1985.
Because of repeated wear and deterioration caused by salt for melting ice, the bridge was restricted to pedestrians and bicycles beginning on December 16, 1986. Following the closure, a new vehicular bridge was planned downstream (to the northeast), tentatively referred to as the "Nineteen and A-Half Street Bridge"; it was built in 1992.
Aside from serving as a pedestrian bridge, the structure has hosted the annual "Gala on the Bridge", a fundraiser for The Greenway Foundation. It began in 2011, and was described in "The Denver Post" as the "first time the bridge has been used for anything other than a way for people to cross the South Platte River".
In the state of Colorado, the 19th Street Bridge is the oldest surviving wrought iron bridge, oldest vehicular bridge at its original location, and oldest vehicular bridge still in public use.
Design.
The bridge's two spans have a through Pratt truss design, each with five panels. The structure is about long with a roadway about wide. The roadbed is asphalt on corrugated metal, replacing the original wood decking. The structural members are made of wrought iron and are pin-connected. The top chords are horizontal, and the upper struts are "unusually deep" I-beams. Sidewalks, decorated with iron newels and latticework, cantilever off both sides of the bridge. The south sidewalk permits pedestrians, while the north one has no deck and carries utility lines. The bridge is supported by ashlar piers of solid stone. The latticed portals feature decorative cast iron crests and finials, and a plaque with the builder's inscription. The bridge is described by History Colorado as one of the most ornamental in Colorado.

Alexandrina Pendatchanska

Alexandrina Pendatchanska (sometimes written as Alexandrina Pendachanska) () (born 24 September 1970) is a Bulgarian operatic soprano. Increasingly, she is known professionally as Alex Penda.
Career.
Pendatchanska was born in Sofia, Bulgaria into a family of renowned Bulgarian musicians. Her grandfather Sasha Popov was a violinist and conductor and the founder of the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra. Her mother Valerie Popova was an internationally acclaimed soprano who sung regularly at La Scala in Milan from 1983 to 1986. She studied piano from early childhood and graduated from Bulgaria's National School of Music, where her subjects were piano and singing. Her vocal teacher was her mother, Valerie Popova.
Making her stage debut at age 17 in the role of Violetta in "La traviata", she soon won the Antonín Dvořák Competition in Karlovy Vary, was placed second in the International Vocal Competition in Bilbao in 1988, and won UNISA singing competition in Pretoria in 1989.
The soprano's debut outside Bulgaria took place in Bilbao, where she sang the title role in "Lucia di Lammermoor". Since 1989 she has sung in many of the most prestigious opera houses around the world, including those in Vienna, Paris, Berlin, New York (at the New York City Opera), Rome, Brussels, Washington, Hamburg, Moscow, Turin, Naples, Santa Fe, Bregenz, Monte Carlo, and Tel Aviv.
Pendatchanska performed the title role of "Esclarmonde" at Teatro Regio in Turin in November 1992 at the age of 22, at which time she was even younger than that of Sybil Sanderson, who created the infamously difficult role at age 24.
During the 1997–2001 operatic seasons Pendatchanska sang the role of Elisabetta in "Roberto Devereux" (Turin and Naples), Adina in "Adina" (Pesaro), Suor Angelica in "Suor Angelica" (Lucca), Luisa in "Luisa Miller" (Naples and Berlin), and in "Ermione" (Santa Fe and New York).
Her other operatic roles include:
Her current repertoire includes:
During the summer 2014 festival season, under the name of Alex Penda, she will appear in The Santa Fe Opera's new production of Beethoven's "Fidelio", singing the role of Leonore.
Critical reception.
On the stage Alexandrina Pendatchanska is particularly praised for her Mozart and bel canto roles, specializing in passionate ladies such as the three Mozart queens, Vitellia, Donna Elvira and Elettra, the last which had often been cited as the definitive interpretation.
Besides being active on the stage, she also sings concert programs around the world including music festivals. Her concert repertoire includes the "Requiem" by Verdi, "Stabat Mater" by Rossini, "La Petite Messe Solennelle" by Rossini, and "Le Roi David" by Honegger.

In Moonlight

"In Moonlight" is a song with music written by the English composer Edward Elgar in 1904 to words from the poem ""An Ariette for Music. To a Lady singing to her Accompaniment on the Guitar"", by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) and published in 1832. 
The song is adapted to a central section of Elgar's concert-overture "In the South (Alassio)" where the ""Canto Popolare"" melody is introduced by a solo viola with a delicate and imaginative accompaniment, which could be likened to Shelley's "...accompaniment on the Guitar."
The first performance of "In the South" was in March 1904. In July that year Elgar made different versions of the ""Canto Popolare"" section. These were variously for small orchestra, for piano and for various instrumental combinations.
In August 1905 the song was reviewed in the London "Times":
The same poem was set by many others including the American composer Amy Beach ("Mrs. H. H. A. Beach"), as her Op. 1 No. 4, with the title "Ariette".
Lyrics.
"Elgar used only the first and third stanzas of Shelley's poem, "An Ariette for Music"."

The George Washington University School of Business

The George Washington University School of Business (GWSB or GW School of Business) is the business school of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., United States. The GW School of Business is a top-tier institution that offers both undergraduate and graduate business degrees in a variety of programs. Located in the heart of one of the most powerful and influential cities in the world, the GW School of Business affords its students and faculty the unique opportunity to conduct academic research on and collaborate with US government agencies, multilateral development banks, non-profit organizations, and thousands of national and multinational corporations.
History.
In 1928, the School was founded on the idea that business and government might become partners in promoting national prosperity and international development. Beginning with a $1 million endowment from The Supreme Council of Scottish Rite Freemasonry Southern Jurisdiction, GW President Cloyd H. Marvin established what was known as the School of Government, with degree programs that integrated business and politics on the national and international levels.
In 1960, the School was renamed the School of Government, Business, and International Affairs. Then, in 1966, President Lloyd H. Elliott split its faculties into a new School of Government and Business Administration (SGBA) and a School of International Affairs—which today bears President Elliott's name. The SGBA was renamed the School of Business and Public Management in 1990. In 2004, it became the School of Business.
Throughout its history, the GW School of Business has attracted some of the nation's most outstanding leaders from academia, government, and the business world. In 1992, F. David Fowler, a managing partner of KPMG, became dean of the school. During his tenure, he dedicated himself to educating a generation of effective managers. Dean Fowler was succeeded in July 1998 by Susan M. Phillips. A former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Dean Phillips brought to the School her expertise in such specializations as derivatives, bank supervision, and financial management. Susan Phillips was succeeded in August 2010 by Doug Guthrie. Dean Guthrie's areas of expertise lie in the fields of leadership and organizational change, corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, and economic reform in China.
In January 2006, the GW School of Business opened its new complex, the newly constructed Ric and Dawn Duquès Hall and the renovated Norma Lee and Morton Funger Hall. This complex provides students, faculty, and staff with a unified center for study and career development activities.
Academics.
The George Washington University School of Business consists of various academic departments including: Accountancy, Finance, Information Systems and Technology Management, International Business, Management, Marketing, Strategic Management and Public Policy, Tourism and Hospitality Management, and Decision Sciences.
On the undergraduate level, the GW School of Business offers two degree programs, a Bachelor of Accountancy, a Bachelor of Business Administration, and a Bachelor of Science in Finance. The school also offers three five-year programs culminating with either a Master of Science in Information Systems, Master of Tourism Administration, or a Master of Accountancy.
On the graduate level, the GW School of Business offers Specialized Masters programs, three different MBA programs, and a highly acclaimed Ph.D. program. The Specialized Masters programs are offered in Accountancy, Finance, Project Management, Informations Systems Technology, and Tourism Administration. The MBA programs consist of the full-time Global MBA, part-time Professional MBA (Flexible or Accelerated), and Executive MBA. Recently, the GW School of Business launched the STAR (Special Talent, Access and Responsibility) Executive MBA program, the "first of its kind customized MBA program for athletes, celebrities."
The GW School of Business is home to various Research Centers and Initiatives:
Campus.
The George Washington University School of Business is centrally located in the trendy Washington, D.C. neighborhood of Foggy Bottom, not far from both the White House and State Department. The GWU campus is also adjacent to the world's leading financial institutions — the Federal Reserve, Organization of American States, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund.

Colin Dayan

Colin Dayan (also known as Joan Dayan), is the Robert Penn Warren Professor in the Humanities at Vanderbilt University, where she teaches American Studies, comparative literature, and the religious and legal history of the Americas. She has written extensively on prison law and torture, Caribbean culture and literary history, as well as on Haitian poetics, Edgar Allan Poe, and the history of slavery. After receiving her Ph.D. from the City University of New York Graduate Center in 1980, she taught at Princeton University, Yale University, the City University of New York, the University of Arizona, and the University of Pennsylvania.
After publishing "A Rainbow for the Christian West" (1977), an introduction to René Depestre’s poetry and a translation of his long poem "Un arc-en-ciel pour l’occident chrétien", she turned to early American literature and published "Fables of Mind: An Inquiry into Poe’s Fiction" (1987). "Haiti, History, and the Gods" (1995, 1998) reorients the study of Haitian history through what she calls “literary fieldwork.” In the process, she recasts many boundaries: between politics and poetics, between the secular and the sacred, and between the colonizer and the colonized, those who deemed themselves masters and those who worked as slaves."The Story of Cruel and Unusual" (2007), focuses on the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and traces the precedents for the torture of detainees in the “war on terror.” Her most recent book, "The Law is a White Dog, How Legal Rituals Make and Unmake Persons" was published by Princeton University Press in Spring 2011 and chosen by "Choice" as one of top-25 books for 2011.
Dayan has received an NEH fellowship (1986); a Guggenheim fellowship (2005) recognized her work on conditions of disfigured personhood and civil death that long outlive slavery itself. She has been a fellow at the Shelby Cullom Davis Center in the Department of History and a fellow in the Program in Law and Public Affairs, both at Princeton. Her memoirs of growing up in Atlanta, Georgia have been published in "The Yale Review", "Southwest Review", and "The Arizona Quarterly". A contributor to the "London Review of Books" and "Boston Review", she writes on contemporary legal practices and the logic of punishment in supermaxes, Abu Ghraib, and Guantánamo. In 2012 she was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Type 38 15 cm howitzer

The was a 1905 German design that was purchased by the Empire of Japan as the standard heavy howitzer of the Imperial Japanese Army at the end of the Russo-Japanese War. The Type 38 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 38th year of Emperor Meiji's reign (1905).
History and development.
As Japan's priority lay in her navy, the Imperial Army was given a back seat to new land warfare designs, as well as the raw material (steel) needed to build them. Thus, like the US who purchased French Renault tanks (Model 1917s) for its first tank units, the planners at the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff found it necessary to purchase artillery, and turned to Krupp in Germany. Initial units were imported, and then further production was made under license by the Army’s Osaka Arsenal starting in 1911.
After World War I, these weapons were considered largely obsolete and efforts were made to replace it with the Type 4 15 cm howitzer. However, it was still found in front line heavy artillery regiments.
Design.
The Type 38 150mm Howitzer was a conventional design for its day, complete with crew seats on the gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield. It was designed to be moved by a team of eight horses, but in practice, its heavy weight was a problem.
The Type 38 150mm Field Gun (improved) was capable of firing High-explosive, shrapnel, incendiary, smoke and illumination and gas shells.
Surplus weapons were also mounted on the chassis of the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank as the Type 4 Ho-Ro self-propelled gun.
Combat record.
Although obsolete, the Type 38 150mm Field Gun was found in theatres of operation in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet-Japanese Border Wars and in the early Pacific War. Against the Chinese, the Type 38 was used with some success due to the fact the Chinese were desperately lacking in heavy artillery in the early part of the war. However, whenever the Japanese did face Chinese heavy artillery typically armed with German 15 cm sFH 18 heavy artillery guns, e.g. in the Battles of Wuhan and Changsha, Japanese gun crews found themselves badly outranged and hopelessly outgunned and the Type 38 was withdrawn from front-line service in 1942. However, as the Type 4 Ho-Ro self-propelled gun, units were deployed on Luzon and other islands in the Philippines, and were used in combat against American forces at the Battle of the Philippines in 1944. Other units were retained on the Japanese home islands in anticipation of the projected Allied invasion.

You Are (Lionel Richie song)

"You Are" is the title of a popular song from 1983 by the R&B singer-songwriter Lionel Richie. "You Are" was written by Richie and his then-wife, Brenda Harvey Richie. It appears on his self-titled debut solo album, which came out in 1982. Resuming where he left off with D-flat major tunes with Commodores' "Sail On", "Still" and "Truly".
Released as the follow-up single to his number-one hit song "Truly", "You Are" reached the top five on three major "Billboard" music charts. On the "Billboard" Hot 100 pop chart, the song spent two weeks at number four in early 1983. It peaked at number two on the R&B chart and spent six weeks at number one on the adult contemporary chart. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number 43 on the British pop chart.
"You Are" is a romantic song, although with a more upbeat arrangement than many of Richie's slower ballads, including a horn section. Before achieving popularity for his own music, singer Richard Marx was a studio musician who can be heard singing backing vocals on "You Are" as well as other songs from Richie's debut album. Kenny Rogers and Jimmy Connors are also heard on backing vocals.

Product binning

In semiconductor device fabrication, product binning is the categorizing of finished products based on their thermal and frequency characteristics.
Definition.
Semiconductor manufacturing is an imprecise process, sometimes achieving as low as 30% yield. Defects in manufacturing are not always fatal, however; in many cases it is possible to salvage part of a failed batch of integrated circuits by modifying performance characteristics. For example, by reducing the clock frequency or disabling non-critical parts that are defective, the parts can be sold at a lower price, fulfilling the needs of lower-end market segments.
This practice occurs throughout the semiconductor industry on products such as CPUs, RAM and GPUs.
Speed Bump.
A speed bump, in computer terms, is a slight increase in frequency (e.g., 1.8 GHz to 1.9 GHz) or a slight increase in functionality (e.g. Nvidia GeForce GTX260 to GTX260 Core 216). Some time after the initial release of a product, manufacturers may choose to increase the clock frequency of an integrated circuit for a variety of reasons, ranging from improved yields to more conservative speed ratings (e.g., actual power consumption lower than TDP).
Testing.
In order to undergo binning, manufactured products require testing. Finished products enter a machine that can test hundreds of pieces at a time, taking only a few hours to complete. Each piece can be tested to determine its highest stable clock frequency and accompanying voltage and temperature while running.
Marketing.
Binning allows large variances in performance to be condensed into a smaller number of marketed designations. This ensures coherency in the marketplace, with tiers of performance clearly delineated. The immediate consequence of this practice is that, for liability reasons, products sold under a certain designation must meet that designation at a "minimum". Individual products may still exceed advertised performance.
Overclocking.
As manufacturers only require meeting the minimum advertised specifications, the potential for overclocking of a product is not typically tested during the binning process. Therefore, it should not be assumed that higher-rated products will overclock better than lower-rated ones.

<doc id="18609360" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18609360" title="Ultralimit">
Ultralimit

In mathematics, an ultralimit is a geometric construction that assigns to a sequence of metric spaces "Xn" a limiting metric space. The notion of an ultralimit captures the limiting behavior of finite configurations in the spaces "Xn" and uses an ultrafilter to avoid the process of repeatedly passing to subsequences to ensure convergence. An ultralimit is a generalization of the notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of metric spaces.
Ultrafilters.
Recall that an ultrafilter "ω" on the set of natural numbers formula_1 is a finite-additive set function (which can be thought of as a measure) formula_2 from the power set formula_3 (that is, the set of "all" subsets of formula_1) to the set {0,1} such that formula_5.
An ultrafilter "ω" on formula_1 is "non-principal" if for every finite subset formula_7 we have "ω"("F")=0.
Limit of a sequence of points with respect to an ultrafilter.
Let "ω" be a non-principal ultrafilter on formula_1.
If formula_9 is a sequence of points in a metric space ("X","d") and "x"∈ "X", the point "x" is called the "ω" -"limit" of "x""n", denoted formula_10, if for every formula_11 we have:
It is not hard to see the following:
An important basic fact states that, if ("X","d") is compact and "ω" is a non-principal ultrafilter on formula_1, the "ω"-limit of any sequence of points in "X" exists (and necessarily unique). 
In particular, any bounded sequence of real numbers has a well-defined "ω"-limit in formula_16 (as closed intervals are compact).
Ultralimit of metric spaces with specified base-points.
Let "ω" be a non-principal ultrafilter on formula_1. Let ("X""n","d""n") be a sequence of metric spaces with specified base-points "p""n"∈"X""n". 
Let us say that a sequence formula_18, where "x""n"∈"X""n", is "admissible", if the sequence of real numbers ("d""n"("xn","pn"))"n" is bounded, that is, if there exists a positive real number "C" such that formula_19.
Let us denote the set of all admissible sequences by formula_20. 
It is easy to see from the triangle inequality that for any two admissible sequences formula_21 and formula_22 the sequence ("d""n"("xn","yn"))"n" is bounded and hence there exists an "ω"-limit formula_23. Let us define a relation formula_24 on the set formula_20 of all admissible sequences as follows. For formula_26 we have formula_27 whenever formula_28 It is easy to show that formula_24 is an equivalence relation on formula_30
The ultralimit with respect to "ω" of the sequence ("X""n","d""n", "p""n") is a metric space formula_31 defined as follows.
As a set, we have formula_32 . 
For two formula_24-equivalence classes formula_34 of admissible sequences formula_21 and formula_22 we have formula_37
It is not hard to see that formula_38 is well-defined and that it is a metric on the set formula_39.
Denote formula_40 .
On basepoints in the case of uniformly bounded spaces.
Suppose that ("Xn","dn") is a sequence of metric spaces of uniformly bounded diameter, that is, there exists a real number "C">0 such that diam("X""n")≤"C" for every formula_41. Then for any choice "pn" of base-points in "Xn" "every" sequence formula_42 is admissible. Therefore in this situation the choice of base-points does not have to be specified when defining an ultralimit, and the ultralimit formula_31 depends only on ("Xn","dn") and on "ω" but does not depend on the choice of a base-point sequence formula_44. In this case one writes formula_45.
Basic properties of ultralimits.
Actually, by construction, the limit space is always complete, even when ("Xn","dn")
is a repeating sequence of a space ("X","d") which is not complete.
Asymptotic cones.
An important class of ultralimits are the so-called "asymptotic cones" of metric spaces. Let ("X","d") be a metric space, let "ω" be a non-principal ultrafilter on formula_1 and let "pn" ∈ "X" be a sequence of base-points. Then the "ω"–ultralimit of the sequence formula_55 is called the asymptotic cone of "X" with respect to "ω" and formula_56 and is denoted formula_57. One often takes the base-point sequence to be constant, "pn" = "p" for some "p ∈ X"; in this case the asymptotic cone does not depend on the choice of "p ∈ X" and is denoted by formula_58 or just formula_59.
The notion of an asymptotic cone plays an important role in geometric group theory since asymptotic cones (or, more precisely, their topological types and bi-Lipschitz types) provide quasi-isometry invariants of metric spaces in general and of finitely generated groups in particular. Asymptotic cones also turn out to be a useful tool in the study of relatively hyperbolic groups and their generalizations.

Motorbase Performance

Motorbase Performance is an English motor racing team, founded in 2004 by former Production Saloon racer Dave Bartrum. They are best known for competing in the British Touring Car Championship.
Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain.
The team started out by contesting the 2004 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain, finishing second in the teams championship despite their best-known driver Damien Faulkner only joining mid-season. However, the 2005 season proved difficult with no wins and poor points performance.
2006 saw the team enter both the Pro class and the newly established Pro-Am class. The teams main charge came from the 1992 BTCC champion Tim Harvey, who managed to score 3 wins on his way to second place in that year's championship. In the 2007 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain, Steven Kane won more races than anyone else, finishing 3rd overall.
The team took a break form the Carrera Cup in 2008 to focus on their British Touring Car Championship campaign but were back for the 2009 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain entering all three classes. Michael Caine was able to take 3 wins for the team during the year on his way to 4th in the championship.
2010 saw Michael Caine lead Motorbase's charge for the title gaining 7 wins along the way. However, he was beaten by 10 points to the title by ex-Motorbase driver Tim Harvey. In 2011, Harvey will attempt to defend his title with Motorbase, partnering his rival Caine.
British Touring Car Championship.
Honda Integra (2006).
For 2006 they entered the BTCC for the first time, running a BTC Touring spec Honda Integra Type R owned and raced by Dave Pinkney. He scored a podium at Knockhill, three further top-five finishes, and 13th place overall.
SEAT Toledo (2006–2007).
For 2007 the team purchased two ex-works, S2000 spec. SEAT Toledo cars, debuting one in the final round of the 2006 BTCC, driven by Tom Ferrier. For 2007 they entered Gareth Howell and rookie Matt Allison, showing pace but having regular accidents, skipping the Knockhill meeting after the carnage of Brands Hatch saw both cars written off. Howell left midseason, replaced by Ferrier, while Paul O'Neill joined Allison for the final round.
BMW 320si E90 (2008–2010).
For 2008 the BTCC cars were replaced by factory-spec BMW 320si E90, driven by Stephen Kane and Rob Collard. The team entered no other championships for the season. After a slow start to the season (not helped by several wet-dry races which did not suit the rear-wheel-drive BMWs), Collard scored 2 top-5 finishes at Croft in round 5. This was followed by a 2nd place finish for Kane at Snetterton.
2009 saw Kane replaced by young Scottish driver Jonathan Adam, who had previously won back to back titles in the SEAT Cupra Championship. Due to new sponsorship with Airwaves, the team began running under the Airwaves BMW banner. 2009 proved a successful season, with Collard winning 2 races and the team finishing 4th in the teams championship.
For 2010, Collard moved to West Surrey Racing, while Motorbase brought in Mat Jackson to replace him. Kane returned to the team, replacing Adam. Together, they were able to take 2 wins and 11 podiums, leading to 4th place in the teams championship for two consecutive seasons.
Ford Focus (2011–).
In 2011 the team raced as Airwaves Racing and ran a trio of Ford Focus STs, which were previously ran by Team Aon the previous year. Although the chassis was built to the S2000 specification, the team used the turbo charged NGTC Engine. Mat Jackson stayed with the team for a second consecutive season and was joined by rookie Liam Griffin.
At the Rockingham and Brands Hatch rounds, the team entered a third car for Porsche Carrera Cup frontrunner Michael Caine.
However, he was replaced in the third car at Silverstone by two-time British Touring Car Champion, James Thompson.
In 2012 the team raced under the banner of Redstone Racing, and continued to race with the three Ford Focus STs. Mat Jackson yet again stayed with the team for a third consecutive season. Liam Griffin returned for his second consecutive season with the team. The pair were joined by former Renault Clio Cup racer, Árón Smith. After a fire in Griffins S2000 Focus meant they were a car short Motorbase built their first car; a NGTC specification global Ford Focus ST Mk.III. This car won its first race at the Silverstone meeting in the hands of Mat Jackson.
For 2013 Airwaves will return as the main sponsor for the team. The team will retain Mat Jackson and Aron Smith who will both drive new NGTC turbocharged Focus ST MkIII while Liam Griffin will continue with the team driving the older S2000 spec turbocharged Focus ST MkII.
Previous Championships.
In 2005 they contested the SEAT Cupra Championship and the GT3 class of the British GT Championship, running an assortment of drivers including Steven Kane, Tim Harvey and David Pinkney.
They also raced in British GTs in 2006 and ventured outside the UK for the first time, in selected rounds of the Le Mans Endurance Series.

West Gate was chosen as the location for the building in order to open the La Défense district to the municipality of Puteaux. The project’s ambition was to create a stronger polarity at the heart of the Île-de-France and develop a major attraction while relating the project to its natural and built environment and, lastly, embodying the various elements which strengthen the feeling that the project belongs in the district.
This project has been cancelled. In 2009, Medea and Layetana announced they are not involved in the project anymore, and the new president of the EPAD Joëlle Ceccaldi-Raynaud declared her opposition to the tower which looks like an unaesthetic "monolith".

348th Fighter Group

The 348th Fighter Group is an inactive unit of the United States Air Force. Its last assignment was with V Fighter Command, stationed at Itami Air Base, Japan. It was inactivated on 10 May 1946.
During World War II, the group operated primarily in the Southwest Pacific Theater. It was the most successful P-47 Thunderbolt unit in the Pacific War. The Group's commander, Colonel Neel Kearby ran up 20+ kills including a 6 kills-in-1-mission for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The Group scored 396 kills, over half of all the kills credited to Fifth Air Force P-47s, and won two United States Distinguished Unit Citations. The Group had 20 P-47 aces including Bob Rowland, Lawrence O'Neill, Bill Banks, Bill Dunham, Walt Benz, Sam Blair, Robert Sutcliffe, and George Davis, who would later be awarded the Medal of Honor flying F-86s during the Korean War.
On 24 May 1946, the group was redesignated as the 108th Fighter Group and allocated to the New Jersey Air National Guard.
History.
The 348th fighter group was activated at Mitchel Army Airfield, New York, on 30 September 1942. It was equipped with the P-47 Thunderbolt. The 348th was one of the first USAAF groups to be equipped with the P-47.
1943.
After an extended period of training in the northeast United States, the personnel boarded the Army transport ship Henry Gibbons and left the wharf at Weehawken, New Jersey on 15 May 1943. They groups personnel all thought they were heading for the European theatre of war. However, they went through the Panama Canal instead and crossed the Pacific Ocean reaching Brisbane, Australia on 14 June 1943. They moved to Archer Field (Archerfield airfield) and waited for their aircraft to arrive. 
The group's P-47D Thunderbolts began to arrive in Brisbane in the same month, and by the end of July after they had "run in" their engines on local training flights, the group began long-range missions to strike at Japanese targets in New Guinea. In mid-June the 348th's three squadrons (340th, 341st, 342d) made the 1,200-mile flight from Brisbane to Port Moresby, New Guinea. The group operated from New Guinea and Noemfoor until November 1944, flying patrol and reconnaissance missions and escorted bombers to targets in New Guinea and New Britain. The 460th Fighter Squadron, stationed at Noemfoor, New Guinea, was also later attached to the 348th Fighter Group on 23 September 1944 .
The arrival of the 348th as the first P-47 group in the Southwest Pacific area coincided with the opening of the Allied offensive in New Guinea. During the summer of 1943 the P-47 missions were chiefly as cover for bombers in the Lae-Salamaua area, and for transports carrying supplies to the new mountain locked airstrip at Tsili, only a few miles from the Japanese held Markham Valley. The group met its first air combat over Tsili on 16 August 1943, when two squadrons tangled with the fighter cover of an enemy bomber formation, and shot down three aircraft.
In September the 348th's planes provided cover for the paratroop landing at Nadzab in the Markham valley, and with the capture of Nadzab and Lae the group entered into one of the most spectacular phases of its overseas career, in a series of fighter sweeps, generally by flights of four planes, over the Japanese stronghold of Wewak. 
Lieutenant Colonel Neel Kearby, the Commanding Officer of the 348th Fighter Group shot down his first Japanese aircraft on 4 September 1943. He shot down a second aircraft on the 15 September 1943. Colonel Kearby was awarded the Medal of Honor for action over New Guinea on 11 October 1943. After leading a flight of four fighters to reconnoiter the enemy base at Wewak, Lt Col Kearby sighted a Japanese bomber formation escorted by more than 30 fighters. Despite the heavy odds and a low fuel supply, and although his mission had been accomplished, Kearby ordered an attack, personally destroying six of the enemy planes. For covering Allied landings and supporting ground forces on New Britain, 16–31 December 1943, the group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation.
1944.
In 1944 the group began to attack airfields, installations, and shipping in western New Guinea, Ceram, and Halmahera to aid in neutralizing those areas preparatory to the US invasion of the Philippines. The group's pilots shot down 100 Japanese planes without the loss of a single pilot in aerial combat. From Finchhaven the group flew its first fighter-bomber missions. In the early spring of 1944, while the group was at Saidor, fighter-bomber work began in earnest with attacks on the Japanese concentrations in the Hansa Bay region just ahead of the advancing Australian troops
After 18 months in New Guinea the 348th boarded ship and plane for the Philippines. One squadron, the 460th, arrived several weeks before the other three, and proceeded to roll up an imposing score of enemy planes, shipping, and personnel destroyed, providing cover for convoys, flying patrols, escorted bombers, attacked enemy airfields, and supporting ground forces. During a three-week period it sank 50,000 tons of enemy shipping, which was slightly more than one-tenth of all the shipping sunk by the entire Fifth Air Force during the year 1944. On 10 November the 460th squadron deployed forward to Tacloban Airfield on Leyte, simultaneously escorting a group of B-25 bombers attacking a convoy loaded with an estimated 10,000 enemy troops en route to reinforce the Japanese army on Leyte. The squadron's planes were the first of the Army Air Force to fly over occupied Manila after the Japanese capture of the Philippines. A flight led by Colonel Dunham, made the first return flight on 17 November 1944.
The group's greatest day, in point of total of enemy planes destroyed, was 14 December 1944 when, in protection of the invasion fleet heading to Mindoro, 5 Japanese planes were shot down, an estimated 75 were destroyed and 20 more damaged, on the airfields of Negros Island only a few minutes flight from the Allied invasion force, which landed on Mindoro the following morning.
In aerial combat at the 348th's best day came on 24 December 1944 when its planes escorting B-24 Liberator heavy bombers in one of the first bomber strikes on Clark Field, met an attempted interception by an estimated 100 Japanese fighters. 32 of the enemy aircraft were definitely destroyed, 7 probably destroyed, the remainder were driven off, and the bombers proceeded undamaged to carry out their mission.
Early in December 1944, while the group's planes were operating from Taoloban strip, the majority of group personnel were camped inland near Burauen when the Japanese landed several hundred paratroops on an uncompleted airstrip less than a quarter of a mile from the group's camp, cutting the only road leading from the camp. For several days the camp was isolated between the paratroops on the East and the Japanese patrols on the West. Two men on guard post were surprised and killed by an enemy patrol, but the camp defense's prevented any breakthrough and the paratroops were finally wiped out by infantry and tanks.
When U.S. troops landed on Luzon the 348th, now in process of conversion from P-47's to P-51 Mustangs, began operation from San Marcelino airstrip a few days after the landing at San Marcelino and Subic Bay. From this location the unit entered upon what many of its members consider its most outstanding work of the war, bombing and strafing in close support of ground troops. This work lacks the excitement and glamor of serial combat, or even of bombing and strafing of seen targets. Bombs and bullets are poured into areas where the enemy is reported to be, and day after day the mission reports stated "Results unobserved due to foliage". Only rarely were advancing ground troops able to tell what part of the damage found was done by a particular air strike.
1945.
At the time the 348th began ground support operations from San Marcelino, the infantry had taken Subic Bay and Olongapo and had started east with the objective of sealing off Bataan so that the Japanese, retreating southward from Lingayen, could not use the Bataan Peninsula's defensive strength as did the U.S. forces in 1942. However, a few miles East of Olongapo stubborn Japanese resistance suddenly had been met in Zigzag Pass, where the road climbed in a series of hairpin turns overlooked by the enemy's positions. Our ground forces had suffered some casualties, had dug in, and in four days had been unable to make any appreciable gain.
On Leyte the 348th had done experimental bombing with a new and highly effective firebomb weapon, and it was proposed that it be used to break the deadlock in Zigzag Pass. However the infantry division occupying the west end of the pass was uncertain about the use of the bomb in close support of their troops, for fear of inaccurate bombing. So a Japanese supply area, well back of their front line, was bombed as a demonstration of accuracy, and was left neatly blanked with flame. There was no further lack of confidence. American infantry proceeded to direct our pilots to bomb and strafe just ahead of their front line, and for seven days advanced steadily until their mission of scaling off the Bataan Peninsula had been accomplished.
Occasionally the curtain of "unobserved results" would lift. One strike, directed by Filipino guerillas who set off smoke pots to mark tan enemy bivouac area, was later found to have caused 700 Japanese casualties. 
After another strike west of Fort Stotsenburg, ground troops were able to move in quickly and found 574 Japanese, all killed by the single air attack. Neigher of those missions involved more than 32 sorties and 30 missions a day. It would be impossible to estimate how many other thousands of enemy dead were covered with the phrase "results unobserved".
During the month of April 1945 the 348th net a record for tonnage of bombs dropped on the enemy, with a total of 2091.5 tons. Total ammunition expended was just under two million rounds. So far as is known, this bomb tonnage is the greatest every dropped in one month by any group, either fighter or bomber, and the accuracy of the bombing attested repeatedly by reports from ground observers. Most of the record tonnage was dropped in the Ipo Dam area northeast of Manila, and helped pave the way for the infantry's capture of that vital control-point of Manila's water supply. From San Marcelino the 348th also flew missions over French Indochina, Hainan, China, and Formosa.
In May 1945 the group moved to Floridablanca airfield, west of Fort Stotsenburg, and from there continued attacks on Japanese ground troops, chiefly in the Cagayan Valley in northern Luzon. By the middle of June the enemy forces had disintegrated and scattered so that profitable targets were hard to find, So operations of the 348th were redirected to the Ryukyus, and the group began operations from Ie Shima in mid-July.
Contrary to expectations the Japanese air forces did not choose to fight, and in the following month only 15 enemy planes were shot down without loss to the 348th in air combat. However there was an abundance of ground and shipping targets in Kyūshū and North China, and the group's P-51's took a constant toll of enemy transportation on water and land before the afternoon of 14 August when the planes of the 348th delivered the last bombs dropped on Japan before the order was given to "cease firing".
Inactivation.
In the immediate postwar era, the group moved to Itami Airfield, Japan in October 1945 as part of Far East Air Forces, performing occupation duty. 
The 348th Fighter Group was inactivated at Itami Airfield on 10 May 1946.
Summary of Victories.
Colonel Kearby went on to score 22 aerial victories. Other aerial aces of the group were Lt. Colonel W.D. Dunham – 16, Lieutenant Colonel William M. Banks – 9, Colonel R.R. Rowland – 8, Major W.G. Benz – 8, Lieutenant Colonel E.F. Roddy – 8, Major S.V. Blair – 7, Captain G.A. Davis Jr. – 7, Captain M.E. Grant – 7, Major J.T. Moore – 7, Major E.S. Popek – 7, Major N.M. Brown – 6, Captain R.H. Fleischer – 6, Captain W.B. Foulis – 6, Captain R.C. Sutcliffe - 5, and First Lieutenant L.F. O'Neill - 5.

Lefkowitz v. Newsome

Lefkowitz v. Newsome, , is a US Supreme Court case which held that when state law permits a defendant to plead guilty without giving up his right to judicial review of specified constitutional issues, such as the lawfulness of a search or the voluntariness of a confession, the defendant is not prevented from pursuing those constitutional claims in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.
Legal background.
Most states require that a defendant must plead not guilty and go to trial to maintain the right to have state appellate review of constitutional challenges he might make to arrest, admissibility of evidence, or the voluntariness of a confession. New York is unique in allowing a defendant to plead guilty while still maintaining these rights.
Facts of the case.
Leon Newsome was arrested on the charge of loitering in the lobby of a New York City Housing Authority apartment building. Upon search, a small quantity of heroin and narcotics paraphernalia was found on his person. Thus he was charged with possession of a dangerous drug and drug paraphernalia, in addition to loitering. Newsome pled not guilty on all charges, claimed the loitering law was unconstitutional, and made a motion to suppress the evidence leading to the drug charges. Upon a non-jury trial by New York City Criminal Court, Newsome was convicted of loitering. In a hearing, the same court rejected the motion to suppress evidence related to the drug charges. One month later, Newsome withdrew his not guilty pleas, pleading guilty to a lesser charge of attempted possession of dangerous drugs. At the sentencing proceeding, Newsome announced that he would appeal both the loitering conviction and the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence related to the drug charges.
Appeals.
The loitering charge was reversed upon appeal for lack of evidence by Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, but the drug convictions were upheld on the grounds that there was probable cause for the original arrest and search. Newsome petitioned for review of the drug conviction to the New York Court of Appeals, but this was denied. The Court also denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.
Newsome subsequently filed a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The petition repeated the claim that because the loitering statute was unconstitutional, Newsome's arrest was therefore invalid, and that as a result, the evidence seized relating to that arrest should be suppressed. Meanwhile, the New York Court of Appeals declared New York's loitering statute unconstitutional before the District Court could render a decision on the merits of Newsome's petition; considering this, the District Court granted Newsome's application for a writ of habeas corpus.
The District Court decided that because Newsome was searched on suspicion for probable cause during an arrest for the violation of a statute subsequently found to be unconstitutional, Newsome's search was unconstitutional and the evidence should be suppressed. The District Court granted the writ of habeas corpus.
The Attorney General of New York sought review of both decisions: the decision that Newsome had not waived his right to file a federal habeas corpus petition by pleading guilty and also the decision that New York's loitering statute was unconstitutional. Since there was a conflict between Newsome's case and a previous decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the US Supreme Court granted certiorari restricted to the question of Newsome's right to file a federal habeas corpus petition challenging the issues in his case; that is, was the search lawful and was the confession voluntary, when a state provides for appellate review of those issues after a guilty plea?
Decision.
The Supreme Court held the following:
... when state law permits a defendant to plead guilty without forfeiting his right to judicial review of specified constitutional issues, the defendant is not foreclosed from pursuing those constitutional claims in a federal habeas corpus proceeding. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed.

Nations in Scottish universities

Nations are student divisions at some of the ancient universities of Scotland. 
Nations were a characteristic of some of the ancient universities and have gradually decreased in significance in recent times. As the newest of the ancient universities, nations never existed at the University of Edinburgh, and were abolished at St Andrews following discussions at the Royal Commission on the Universities of Scotland, which later led to the Universities (Scotland) Acts. 
Student nations continued into modern times at the University of Aberdeen and the University of Glasgow for the specific purpose of electing a Rector of the university. 
St Andrews.
The University of St Andrews, in common with continental universities at the time of its founding, was divided into nations each presided over by a Procurator. The four nations were originally Albany, Angus, Lothian and Britain covering approximately North West, North East, South East and South West Scotland. Later, the original Albany was renamed Fife, while Britain became Albany and included the Western Isles and all places outside of Scotland.
The four nations each chose an “intrant”, who in turn chose the Lord Rector. At that time the duties of Rector were similar to those of the Principal of the university today. In case of a tie, the decision was left to the outgoing Lord Rector. 
The use of the nations system for rectorial elections was discontinued after the national establishment of elected Rectors under the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.
Glasgow.
At the University of Glasgow the use of nations continued until 1977 for the election of the university's Lord Rector. The University has four nations, originally called Clydesdale, Teviotdale, Albany and Rothesay, and later as Clydesdale ("Glottiana"), Lothian, "Transforthana" (land over the Forth, essentially Albany) and Rothesay. Respectively, their heraldic symbols are: a two headed bird over crossed tools, an anchor over crossed tools, a horn over crossed tools and a sailing ship over crossed tools.
Three of the 'nations' consisted of defined areas in Scotland, with Loudoniana consisting of students from all other places. The heraldic symbols of the nations can be seen in the stonework of a number of university buildings, including the Glasgow University Union and the chapel, under the Latin title of the university. 
Aberdeen.
The University of Aberdeen also had a system of nations. Following the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858, the use of nations to elect the Lord Rector continued via the election of Procurators, similar to the system used at the University of Glasgow, with the Chancellor having deciding vote in case of a tie. The four nations of the University were Angus, Mar (""Marriensis""), Buchan (""Buchanensis"") and Moray (""Moraviensis""). 
Prior to the 1858 Act, Glasgow and Marischal College, one of Aberdeen's predecessor universities, were alone in making provision via the nations for election of a Rector.

Moor Row

Moor Row is a village situated in North West England. It is in Cumbria and is located on a minor road off the A595 road south of Whitehaven.
Moor Row is a residential community situated between Whitehaven and Egremont on Cumbria's coastal plain. The history of Moor Row goes back to at least 1762, but it was the 19th century discovery of iron ore in the vicinity that built the 'row of houses on a moor'. Cornish tin miners moved here to work the mines, and their presence is noted in a number of street names such as Penzance Street. One street, Dalzell, is named after Thomas Henry Dalzell, a mine owner. 
Houses.
The village name probably refers to the Scalegill street houses, which are noted on an 1860 Ordnance Survey map. The 1859 homes on Dalzell Street are thought to be the oldest of the terraced rows. The village has grown in the 20th century, adding modern suburban homes to the mixture.
Mines.
Moor Row's Montreal Mines produced 250,000 tons a year, the largest of any mine in the Whitehaven or Furness district. The mine property covered , half of which was ore bearing. Both open pit and shaft mining took place. Between 1000 to 1200 people were employed locally in the industry.
Railway.
Moor Row formerly had a station on the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Junction Railway. A railway shunting yard was built in the village, bringing further jobs and prosperity to the inhabitants. It became western Cumbria's most important junction and goods yard until the end of World War II when trucks and the motorways brought about the decline of the railways in the UK. The railway closed in 1980 with the closing of the last mine at Beckermet. The railway is still in situ and runs to Mirehouse Junction. It is also now part of both the national coast to coast walk and cycleway.
Employment.
Westlakes Science and Technology Park is a local employer today. Also the nuclear power plant Sellafield is a few miles away which also offers local employment. 
Facilities.
Moor Row is extremely popular with walkers. It currently has Two car garage, an Evangelical Church and a Working Mens Club. The village has recently (2009) just opened up a cafe.
Sport.
The Village has a football team, Moor Row F.C.

Type 4 15 cm howitzer

The was a heavy howitzer used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. The Type 4 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 4th year of Emperor Taishō's reign (1915).
History and development.
The Type 4 15 cm Howitzer was designed by the Army’s Osaka Armory to rectify the shortcomings of the Type 38 15 cm howitzer – namely its lack of portability. The Type 96 15 cm Howitzer was intended to replace it, but it remained in use throughout World War II. Weapons captured by the Chinese remained in use at least through the Chinese Civil War. The Type 4 (1915) 150-mm Howitzer was designed during World War I to replace the Type 38 15 cm Howitzer. It was manufactured in considerable quantities and remained the standard Japanese medium artillery piece until 1936. It still has by no means been completely superseded, and has been encountered during the present war on many fronts.
The Type 4 is the first Japanese weapon to replace the hydrospring recoil system with the hydropneumatic. Its modified box trail allows it to fire at extreme elevations, increasing its usefulness in jungle or rugged terrain.
Design.
The Type 4 was notable as the first Japanese artillery piece to use a hydro-pneumatic recoil system. It had a vertical sliding breechblock and a box type trail. It could be moved short distances as one load, but needed to be broken down into two loads for longer distances. The gun barrel was removed from the cradle and placed on the rear portion of the trail, to which were attached an extra pair of wheels. A limber was attached to each section, so that each load could be towed by six horses. 
The type 4 used semifixed ammunition with high-explosive, as well as armor-piercing, shrapnel, chemical, smoke and incendiary tracer projectiles.
Its most remarkable characteristic of the Type 4 is its extreme lightness in relation to the weight of the ammunition it fires. The howitzer is broken down into two loads-the tube and the cradle assembly-for travel. This operation increases the time necessary to emplace it, but in areas where bridges are flimsy or nonexistent, two-load draft considerably increases the mobility of the piece. Although it is possible to tow the Type 4 in one load, it is not safe to do this for considerable distances or over bad roads because of the extreme length of the trail which would be likely to break if subjected to any considerable jolting.
Combat record.
Type 4 15 cm Howitzer was considered somewhat obsolescent for frontline combat service from the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but as insufficient quantities of the Type 96 15 cm howitzer were produced, it remained in service on many fronts during the Pacific War. Against the Chinese, the Type 4 was used with some success due to the fact the Chinese were desperately lacking in heavy artillery in the early part of the war. However, whenever the Japanese did face Chinese heavy artillery typically armed with German 15 cm sFH 18 heavy artillery guns, e.g. in the Battles of Wuhan and Changsha, Type 4 crews found themselves badly outranged and hopelessly outgunned. 
Weapons captured by the Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, or abandoned in China at the time of the surrender of Japan, were placed into service by both the National Revolutionary Army of the Nationalist government and the People's Liberation Army of the Chinese communist forces through the Chinese Civil War.

List of diplomatic missions of Malawi

This is a list of diplomatic missions of Malawi, excluding honorary consulates. Malawi's Former President Muluzi continued the pro-Western foreign policy established by former President Banda. It maintains excellent diplomatic relations with principal Western countries. Malawi's close relations with South Africa throughout the apartheid era strained its relations with other African nations. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, Malawi developed, and currently maintains, strong diplomatic relations with all African countries. It has a dispute with Tanzania over the boundary in Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi).

Horn Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)

Joseph Haydn's Horn Concerto No. 1 in D major, (Hob. VIId/3) was completed in 1762, "when Haydn was new to the Esterhazy court." The work is in three movements:
Because of the low range writing in the Adagio, some musicologists believe the concerto was written for Thaddaus Steinmuller. Other musicologists believe it was a present for the baptism ceremony of one of the children of Joseph Leutgeb (for whom Mozart wrote his horn concertos).

Rockhill Partners

Rockhill Partners is an early-stage venture capital partnership. The firm invests in companies in the life science and technology sectors throughout the U.S. Current investments include Proteon Therapeutics, Orbis Biosciences and Infegy.
Portfolio companies.
Rockhill's first investment was Proteon Therapeutics. Proteon's core technology was created by Dr. F. Nicholas Franano while at Johns Hopkins University. Proteon has secured nearly $80 million from investors including Novartis, MPM Capital, TVM Lifesciences, Skyline Ventures and Intersouth Partners to develop the company's lead drug compound. This drug, currently known as PROT-201, could prove vital in managing some of the worst problems encountered with kidney dialysis. In March 2009, Proteon entered into an option agreement with Novartis to be acquired for up to $550 million as certain development milestone are met.
Rockhill's second investment, LightSpeed Genomics, was based on technology created at MIT. According to "In Sequence", a publication which covers the race to decode the human genome, "LightSpeed Genomics, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is developing a high-speed DNA sequencing platform that 'will allow human genome sequencing to be performed more quickly and less expensively than ever before,' according to the company’s website...LightSpeed founder and CEO Josh (Jekwan) Ryu told In Sequence...that the company is currently in stealth mode and not yet ready to talk about its plans. Ryu, who holds a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a former Affymetrix staff scientist with 3 patents (US2005/0239113, US2005/0239114, US2005/0239115). Stanley Hong, a former colleague of Mr. Ryu from MIT, is a co-founder and chief technology officer of the company...Formerly called Solametrix, LightSpeed Genomics received an undisclosed amount of funding from Rockhill Partners and other angel investors in March 2007." In 2009, two Korean companies, Macrogen Corporation and the Korean Technology Investment Fund, teamed up to acquire LightSpeed from its original investors.
Professor George M. Church of Harvard University chairs LightSpeed's scientific advisory board. With Nobel prize winner Walter Gilbert, Church developed the first direct genomic sequencing method and helped initiate the Human Genome Project, both in 1984. Church and a team are currently competing in the Archon X-Prize Competition. To win the $10 million genomics prize purse, teams must successfully sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days for less than $10,000 per genome.
Rockhill's third publicly disclosed investment, Orbis Biosciences, was formed around technology created at the University of Illinois. Orbis is a micro particle fabrication company for pharma and agricultural applications like sustained release drugs and taste masking. An April 2009 story in the Kansas City Business Journal featured Orbis vice president Maria Stecklein.
Two of Rockhill's partners have been involved in incubating Infegy, Inc. Infegy was founded by Justin Graves and Adam Coomes to commercialize SocialRadar. SocialRadar is a social media monitoring, measurement and management tool for the web. Clients include numerous advertising agencies and corporate clients.

<doc id="18609625" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18609625" title="The Voice Squad">
The Voice Squad

The Voice Squad are a traditional Irish singing group from Ireland. The members include Gerry Cullen, Phil Callery and Fran McPhail. They have recorded two albums and have toured Ireland, the UK and the US.
Though group singing, especially in harmony, is not part of the Irish music tradition, The Voice Squad have a considerable repertoire of Irish traditional songs and have always sung unaccompanied.
'Many's The Foolish Youth, first issued in 1987, was the first record by Fran, Gerry and Phil. Later they became known as The Voice Squad. Their style of singing in harmony does not form part of the Irish singing tradition, but each of the singers had already served his time in our individual tradition before coming together to sing in harmony.' - Frank Harte
They have been compared to English family groups of similar style, such as 'The Watersons' and 'The Copper Family'. 'It is the union of the distinct tenor voices of Fran and Phil plus the bass of Gerry, along with their own particular arrangements of good songs, that has made them one of the most distinctive unaccompanied singing groups of recent times.'
Performances.
The group have performed in Ireland, the UK, Europe and the US. 'In October 2002 they performed, in front of Ireland's President Mary McAleese, at the Gala opening of Dublin's newest concert venue The Helix at Dublin City University. The concert was recorded by RTÉ television for later transmission. The track they performed was a special Shaun Davey arrangement of "The Parting Glass".'
In June 2003 the group performed at the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics World Games, in Ireland with Rita Connolly and Ronan Tynan to perform "May We Never Have To Say Goodbye", composed by Shaun Davey, which was the theme song for the games.
"The Voice Squad represent the melding of two related but separate traditions — a British harmony-singing tradition (as exemplified by the Copper Family and the Watersons) and the unaccompanied solo singing tradition of Northern Ireland (as exemplified by such legendary artists as Paddy Tunney and Joe Heaney). By taking the traditional Irish repertoire and harmonizing it in a generally British style, the three members of the Voice Squad have created something new and absolutely wonderful. All three singers have excellent voices, but tenor Fran McPhail is the one who brings something tonally unique to the ensemble; his voice has an eerie, almost horn-like quality that blends beautifully with the harder-edged voices of tenor Phil Callery and baritone Gerry Cullen. - Rick Anderson, Allmusic
Recordings.
The Voice Squad have recorded three albums, Good People All being a re-release of Holly Wood with the same tracks.
'We Sang in St. Kevin's Church during the "Music Under the Mountains" festival in 1991. The natural stone quality was the best we have ever found so we came back to record this album. Most of these recordings were made in the Church, some during a concert. Other tracks were recorded in John Butler's house. St. Kevin's Church is the oldest Christian Church in Leinster which is still in use. It was built on the site of a hermit's cell, inhabited by St. Kevin before he went to Glendalough. The building is approximately 1000 years old and is now the Hollywood Heritage Centre. Hollywood is a village situated on the western approach to the Wicklow Mountains.'

Norwegian Housing Directorate

The Norwegian Housing Directorate () was a Norwegian government agency concerned with housing.
It was a department named "Bygningsavdelingen" within the Ministry of the Interior, but in 1945, when the German occupation of Norway ended, it was transferred to the Ministry of Provisioning and Reconstruction under the name "Gjenreisningsavdelingen". The name was later changed to the Norwegian Directorate for Reconstruction, and in March 1946 it was changed again to the Norwegian Housing Directorate. The demand of housing in Norway was pressing.
When the Ministry of Provisioning and Reconstruction was discontinued in 1950, the Housing Directorate was moved to the Ministry of Local Government and Labour.
In 1965 it was discontinued. Its tasks and personnel were divided between the Norwegian State Housing Bank and a new department within the Ministry of Local Government and Labour.

USS Teaberry (AN-34)

USS "Teaberry" (AN-34/YN-29) was an "Aloe"-class net laying ship which was assigned to serve the U.S. Pacific Fleet during World War II with her protective anti-submarine nets and, at war's end, returned home safety with one battle star to her credit. She was later reactivated for duty during the Korean War era.
Built in Camden, New Jersey.
"Teaberry" (YN-29) was laid down on 25 October 1940 by John H. Mathis & Company, Camden, New Jersey; launched on 24 May 1941; sponsored by Miss Mary C. Howard; and placed in service on 16 March 1942.
World War II service.
"Teaberry" operated in the 1st Naval District out of Boston, Massachusetts, until February 1943 when she shifted to the 7th Naval District at Miami, Florida. Late in March, she was ordered to Trinidad and operated from there until 8 March 1944 when she steamed to Charleston, South Carolina, to prepare for service in the South Pacific Ocean.
In May, "Teaberry" sailed for New Guinea via Miami, Florida, Guantanamo Bay, the Panama Canal, Bora Bora, and New Caledonia. Upon arrival at Milne Bay on 22 July, she provided services to units of the U.S. 7th Fleet and operated out of that port, Langemak, and Hollandia, until ordered to the Philippine Islands early in 1945. The net layer served there until 4 June 1946 when she headed for Hawaii.
"Teaberry" arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 July and, on the 14th, proceeded to the U.S. West Coast. The ship was at San Francisco, California, from 24 July to 9 October when she was assigned to the 19th Reserve Fleet at Astoria, Oregon. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 14 December 1946.
Recommissioned during the Korean War.
"Teaberry" was recommissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 19 April 1952 and assigned to the 12th Naval District with San Francisco designated as her home port. She arrived there on 13 May and served in the 12th Naval District until July 1961, rendering such services to the fleet as: training students in net and boom defense techniques; working with the Research and Development Division of the Naval Net Depot, Tiburon, California; and participating in mine planting and recovery exercises. 
By August 1953, the ship had been equipped as a "diving-type vessel;" and she assisted the Submarine Force, United States Pacific Fleet, in submarine rescue, surface and aerial torpedo recovery, and submarine communications.
Final decommissioning.
"Teaberry" was again decommissioned on 7 July 1961 and struck from the Navy List on 1 August 1961. On 12 January 1962, "Teaberry" was sold to the Pacific Towboat and Salvage Co., for scrap.
Honors and awards.
"Teaberry" earned one battle star (for Leyte operation) during World War II.

Yenikapı

Yenikapı () is a port and a quarter in Istanbul, Turkey, in the metropolitan district of Fatih on the European side of the Bosphorus and along the southern shore of the city's historically central peninsula.
Yenikapı is notable for the ongoing excavations on its Byzantine port discovered in 2004. This has become one of the largest investigations in Europe, because of the size and the number of the shipwrecks found since the initial discovery, and the large number of associated artefacts. The commercial harbor, called the Harbour of Theodosius, in use between the 5th and the 10th centuries, was an alternative to Constantinople's traditional berths situated along the inlet of the Golden Horn.
Yenikapı is also the site of a future underground mass rapid transit terminal, construction of which has been delayed by the massive excavations currently in progress. Once completed the new Yenikapi terminal will provide interchange between the Hafif LRT line connecting to the airport, the Istanbul Metro and the new Marmaray railway link connecting the Asian and European sides of the city through a new tunnel under the Bosporus.
Yenikapı has a station on the suburban railway line Sirkeci-Halkalı.
Archaeology.
During the archaeological excavation at the Yenikapı Marmaray construction site, it has been learned that Istanbul's history dates back further than was previously thought, some 8,500 years.
8,000-year-old skeletons were discovered and with the continuous excavations further graves have been unearthed. The graves reveal that Istanbul used to be home to the earliest settlements during the Stone Age. The skeletons were found in four prehistoric graves.
Other than skeletons, the digs have revealed 34 sunken ships dating back to the seventh and 11th centuries. The sunken ships have been conserved at the Istanbul University and the Underwater Research Institute in Bodrum.
There were also remnants of some walls found during the excavations. They are now considered as the first city walls of Constantinople when it was founded as Byzantion.
About 500 pieces taken from the relics unearthed during the Marmaray excavations were exhibited at the Istanbul Archeology Museum.

Califano v. Goldfarb

Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the different treatment of men and women mandated by constituted invidious discrimination against female wage earners by affording them less protection for their surviving spouses than is provided to male employees, and therefore violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Background.
Leon Goldfarb, a widower in the state of New York, applied for survivor's benefits under the Social Security Act. Goldfarb's late wife wife Hannah paid Social Security taxes for 25 years, yet his application was denied. In order to be eligible for benefits under 42 U.S.C § 402, he must have been receiving half his support from his wife at her time of death. 42 U.S.C Section 402 did not impose this requirement on widows. Goldfarb challenged the statute under theDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The District Court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. The Government appealed to the Supreme Court
Question Before the Court.
Do gender-specific requirements for benefits of the Social Security Act violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?
Decision of the Court.
In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the District Court ruling that gender specific requirements for Social Security benefits unconstitutional. Citing an "indistinguishable" situation in "Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld", Justice Brennan wrote the decision for the court. He noted that in "Weinberger," a "indistinguishable" statutes was deemed unconstitutional. With this, and several other gender-equality cases, the court rejected the "archaic and overbroad" generalizations that a wife is more likely to be dependent on her husband than a husband on his wife." Justice Stevens wrote in concurrence with the majority, and Justice Rehnquist wrote in dissent.

Inspired by darkness and by a photo of a couple, that Almodóvar took of El Golfo beach in Lanzarote in the late 1990s, the film serves as an homage to filmmaking, cinema and its various film genres. Stylistically, it is a complex noir-ish melodrama, that also blends comic elements with a film within a film—a broad comedy, that hearkens back to Almodóvar's 1988 release, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown". Thematically, "Broken Embraces" addresses themes like voyeurism, repression, prostitution, death, vengeance, fixation, illness, and drugs.
"Broken Embraces" was one of the films competing for the Palme d'Or at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Dubbed "purest Almodóvar" by "The New Yorker", the film was noted for the director's characteristic "bright primary colors," erotic subject matter, and meticulous, "visually pulsating" cinematography. The picture was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at both the 2009 British Academy Film Awards and the 67th Golden Globe Awards.
Plot.
"Harry Caine" is a blind writer who shares his life with his agent Judit and her adult son, Diego. Slowly, events in the present begin to bring back memories of the past. Harry hears that millionaire Ernesto Martel has died; a young filmmaker, Ray X, appears and turns out to be Martel's son, Ernesto, Jr. After Diego is hospitalized for an accidental drug overdose in a Madrid nightclub, Harry collects Diego from the hospital and looks after him to avoid worrying his traveling mother. The main storyline is told in flashback as Harry reluctantly tells Diego a tragic tale of fate, jealousy, abuse of power, betrayal, and guilt.
The first flashback is to 1992, which introduces Magdalena "Lena" Rivero, Martel's beautiful young secretary, an aspiring actress. She becomes close to Martel, a millionaire financier, in order to find the money to help meet her dying father's medical bills. By 1994, she has become Martel's mistress. At this time, Harry is still living under his real name, Mateo Blanco, a well-respected film director. Martel is excessively possessive of Lena, but she is determined to become an actress and manages to win the main role in Blanco's film "Chicas y maletas" ("Girls and Suitcases") by bringing Martel in as financier/producer. (The fictional film is similar to Almodóvar's 1988 release, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown", except that the Shiite terrorists have been replaced by a cocaine dealer; several of the cast of the previous film appear in the fictional one.) Martel spies on Lena and Mateo by sending his inhibited, effeminate gay son, Ernesto, Jr., to videotape the production of the film, ostensibly for a "making of" feature, then hiring a lip-reader to interpret the conversations. Martel, seething with jealousy, screens the videos as the lip-reader narrates the furtive whispers of Lena and Mateo's passionate affair. 
Furious, Martel confronts Lena, and when she threatens to leave him he pushes her down the stairs. But when she survives the fall, he relents and nurses her back to health. The filming completed, Lena and Blanco escape Martel's hold and go on holiday to Lanzarote. Lena takes a job as a hotel receptionist to pass the time. When she and Blanco read in "El País" that "Chicas y maletas" has received a terrible critical reception, likely the end of Blanco's directing career, they determine to start over together far from Madrid. Fate intervenes when Blanco is seriously injured and Lena is killed in a car accident, which ironically is immortalized by Ernesto Jr., who has been trailing them with his camcorder. Mateo loses his sight permanently. Judit, his long-time production assistant, and an 8-year-old Diego arrive to help Blanco pick up the pieces and return to Madrid, where he eventually writes screenplays in braille under the pseudonym Harry Caine, represented by his agent, Judit.
The story picks up where it began in 2008: Harry shares his birthday in a bar with Judit and Diego. Judit becomes drunk on gin and, stricken with guilt, confesses to Harry that she sold out to Martel in 1994 because of her fury at Harry for abandoning the film to run away with Lena; she also tells him of her involvement in providing Martel the phone number of the hotel in Lanzarote where Lena and Mateo were hiding. She confirms that Martel sabotaged the release of "Chicas y maletas" by using the worst take from each scene in order to destroy Mateo's reputation. The next morning she reveals to Diego that Harry is actually his father, a fact both men were unaware of. Having exorcised some of his demons, Harry decides to return to his life as Mateo Blanco. Though believed lost, the original reels of "Chicas y maletas" and Ernesto Jr.'s camcorder footage are recovered: Judit had ignored Martel's order to destroy them and instead hid them away. Mateo and Diego re-edit the film for its long-delayed release as the director envisioned it.
Reception.
The film has received generally positive reviews by critics; review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 81% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 145 reviews. Its consensus states "Pedro Almodóvar's fourth film with Penélope Cruz isn't his finest work, but he brings his signature visual brilliance to this noirish tale, and the cast turns in some first-class performances." It currently holds a score of 76 (generally favorable reviews) on Metacritic. "Chicago Sun-Times" film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and wrote that ""Broken Embraces" is a voluptuary of a film, drunk on primary colors, caressing Penélope Cruz, using the devices of a Hitchcock to distract us with surfaces while the sinister uncoils beneath." 
The film was accepted into the main selection at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in competition for the prestigious Palme d'Or, Almodóvar's third to do so, and fourth to screen at the festival. "Broken Embraces" was nominated for the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Almodóvar's sixth film to be nominated in this category. It was also nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Foreign Language Film, as well as the Satellite Award for Best Actress for Penélope Cruz's performance.
Soundtrack.
The film includes an original soundtrack album composed entirely by Alberto Iglesias, which was released in Spain on CD format to coincide with the film's release. The film also includes two English tracks from American artists: "Robot Oeuf" by Uffie, and a cover of Michael Hurley's "Werewolf" by Cat Power.

2008–09 Top 14 season

The 2008–09 Top 14 Competition was a French domestic rugby union club competition operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR). It ran from late August 2008 through the final at Stade de France on June 6, 2009, in which Perpignan lifted the Bouclier de Brennus with a 22–13 win over Clermont.
This year's edition of the Top 14 welcomed Toulon, winners of the 2008 title in the second-level Pro D2, and Mont-de-Marsan, victors in the 2008 promotion playoffs between the second- through fifth-place teams in Pro D2. They took the place of Auch and Albi, relegated at the end of the 2007–08 Top 14. Auch, which had been promoted to the Top 14 for 2007–08, finished bottom of the table and went down. The other newly promoted team in 2007–08, Dax, finished second-from-bottom, but were reprieved when French sporting authorities forcibly relegated 12th-place Albi to Pro D2 due to financial issues.
Season synopsis.
While the four playoff teams—Perpignan, Toulouse, Clermont, and Stade Français—separated themselves from the pack fairly early in the season, it was Toulouse who were the form team in the first half of the season; they had a Top 14-record streak of 11 wins from Round 5 through Round 15. However, Perpignan surged in the second half of the season, finishing level with Toulouse on the season log; the Catalans claimed the top seed on the first tiebreaker of head-to-head competition points. Biarritz used a late-season surge to claim fifth place, while the final Heineken Cup berth was ultimately decided in the final round, when Brive's draw with Bourgoin combined with Bayonne's win over Stade Français without a bonus point left Brive and Bayonne level on the log; Brive won on the second tiebreaker of head-to-head scoring.
At the other end of the ladder, Mont-de-Marsan were rarely competitive and finished bottom. The second relegation place finally fell on Dax, after Bourgoin, Castres, and the highly ambitious Toulon spent time in relegation trouble.
For much of the season, Bourgoin faced another type of relegation trouble—financial. At the end of each season, all teams in both divisions of LNR must pass a financial audit conducted by DNACG ("Direction nationale d'aide et de contrôle de gestion"), LNR's financial arm, to be able to keep their professional licenses. The club were able to satisfy DNACG that they had sufficient financial guarantees to participate in Top 14 and were thus allowed to stay in the top flight.
Competition format.
Each club plays every other club twice. The second half of the season is conducted in the same order as the first, with the club at home in the first half of the season away in the second. As in previous seasons, the top four clubs at the end of the home-and-away season advanced to a single-elimination playoff. The semifinals were held at neutral sites on May 29 and 30, with the final at Stade de France on June 6.
Going into the season, the top six clubs were guaranteed of berths in the 2009–10 Heineken Cup, with the possibility of a seventh if a French club had advanced further in the 2008–09 Heineken Cup than any team from England or Italy. However, the seventh French berth did not materialize this season, as the only Top 14 club to make the knockout stage, Toulouse, were eliminated in the quarterfinals, while England's Leicester Tigers reached the final (where they lost to Irish side Leinster). The sixth-place team would have been relegated to the 2009–10 European Challenge Cup if 11th-place Bourgoin had won the 2008–09 Challenge Cup final on 22 May; however, Bourgoin were defeated by English side Northampton Saints.
The bottom two teams are provisionally relegated to Pro D2, with the possibility of one or both of the bottom teams to be reprieved if a team above them fails a postseason financial audit (mandatory for all clubs in the league).
The LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007-08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also makes it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for 2008-09.
France's bonus point system operates as follows:

Ministry of Provisioning and Reconstruction

The Royal Norwegian Ministry of Provisioning and Reconstruction () was a Norwegian ministry that existed from 1939 to 1950.
It was established on 1 October 1939 as the Ministry of Provisioning, though having no relation to the Ministry of Provisioning which existed from 1916 to 1922. The name was changed to the Ministry of Provisioning and Reconstruction in 1942. It ceased to exist on 30 June 1950. Its tasks were transferred to various ministries.
From the beginning in 1939 the ministry consisted of four directorates and one department (). The directorates were led by Nikolai Schei, Jens Bache-Wiig, Per Prebensen and Øivind Lorentzen. The department was led by Alf Frydenberg with Erling Mossige and Andreas Schei as heads of office.

Bothriopsis bilineata

Bothriopsis bilineata is a venomous pitviper species found in the Amazon region of South America. A pale green arboreal species that may reach 1 m inlength, it is an important cause of snakebite throughout the entire Amazon region. Two subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.
Description.
Adults usually do not grow to more than 70 cm in length, although some may reach 100 cm. The maximum reported size is 123 cm. The body is relatively slender, with a prehensile tail.
The scalation includes 23-35 dorsal scales at midbody, 190-218/192-220 ventral scales in males/females and 65-76/55-73 mostly divided subcaudal scales in males/females. On the head are 5-9 keeled intersupraoculars, 8-12 sublabial scales and 7-9 supralabial scales. Of the latter, the second is usually fused with the prelacunal to form a lacunolabial, although partial or complete sutures may exist to separate these scales.
The colour pattern consists of a pale green ground colour overlaid dorsally with either a peppering of black spots, or a series of tan or reddish brown spots that are usually paired. The ventrals are bordered by a creamy yellow line running down the length of the body, while the belly itself is yellow and bordered with a tinge of green. The latter part of the tail is pink and bordered with yellow. The head is either green with a scattering of small black spots, or green with isolated tan or reddish brown spots that are bordered in black. The iris is pale green, while the labials are yellow green, often with black spots.
The nominate subspecies, "B. b. bilineata", has vertical dark stripes on the supralabial scales and a dorsal pattern of reddish brown spots with black flecks.
Geographic range.
This species is found in the Amazon region of South America: Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. An isolated population is known from the Atlantic versant of southeastern Brazil. The type locality given is "Brasilien".
Habitat.
It is found in lowland rain forest, in shrubbery, palms and trees, especially in the vicinity of water. It is almost always found in bushes and trees along streams or along the edges for forest clearings, mostly associated with primary forest, although has also been found in older secondary forest near primary forest.
Behaviour.
Nocturnal, this species spends the day hidden in thick foliage, tree hollows, or at the base of palm fronds, and always in places where it can anchor itself with its prehensile tail. It tends to rely on ambush instead of actively hunting for prey.
Feeding.
The diet consists of small mammals, such as mouse opossums ("Marmosa"), mice, birds, lizards, and frogs. Juveniles tend to remain closer to the ground to feed on small frogs and lizards.
Reproduction.
It is ovoviviparous, with females giving birth to live young.
Venom.
This species is an important cause of snakebite throughout the entire Amazon region. Due to its arboreal nature, most bites are to the upper body, including hands, arms, and faces.
Clinical features of bite wounds include bruising, profound coagulopathy, and spontaneous bleeding. Symptoms reported from various case histories include local pain, swelling, bruising, bleeding of the gums, loss of consciousness, hematemesis, hematuria, fever, erythema, bleeding from the fang punctures, shock, bleeding from the mouth, nose and eyes, nausea, and incoagulable blood. At least one death has been reported.
Subspecies.
If these subspecies are eventually proved to be monophyletic, then this will suggest that the Amazon Rainforest split into eastern and western parts before the eastern part split from the more southern Atlantic Forest.

L'oncle Paul

"Les Belles Histoires de l'oncle Paul, and later Les Plus Belles Histoires de l'oncle Paul", is a Belgian comics series of historical stories created by Jean-Michel Charlier and Eddy Paape and published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine "Spirou" from 1951 to 1982.
Theme.
The series consists of various short stories relating the historical character's life, an invention, an historical event, or a story taking place in the past. A wise and learned man, the uncle Paul, use a pretext to tell a story to his two nephews, most of the time following a foolish remark or deed of the nephews. The purpose of the series was entirely educational and didactic, and served as a kind of illustrated history lessons for the young "Spirou" readers.
Publication history.
The first strip appeared in the issue 668 of "Spirou" at the beginning of 1951, named "Cap plein Sud". The series was first drawn by Eddy Paape, who at that time was drawing the series "Valhardi". In 1952, Octave Joly became the main writer of the series. This series, very popular, made it possible for a lot of newcoming authors to hone their skills and make themselves well-known, among them Paape, Attanasio, Jean Graton, Mitacq ("La Patrouille des Castors"), Hermann ("Jeremiah") and Gérald Forton ("Bob Morane"). Several albums grouping the strips were published between in the 1950s. In the 70s, the series appeared less frequently, and finally disappeared in the 80s. "L'oncle Paul" was parodied many times in "Spirou" as well as in other magazines. An album of parodies was published.
Albums.
"Les Histoires vraies de l'Oncle Paul" is a series of comics albums published by Dupuis grouping the "Belles Histoires de l'Oncle Paul" stories previously published in "Spirou". 
In 1986, "Les Histoires merveilleuses de l' Oncle Paul" were published by Vents d'Ouest (ISBN 2-86967-012-5) and EDS (ISBN 2-905359-04-8). This was a pastiche and hommage album, featuring stories by a.o. Yves Chaland, Will, Frank Pé, Dany, Serge Clerc and Philippe Bercovici. 
Many stories were later republished by Dupuis and other publishers, either as thematic albums or by author in anthology series.

Pas pour moi

"Pas pour moi" ("Not for me") was the Swiss entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest 1986 in Bergen, Norway. It was sung by Daniela Simmons and performed in French.
On the night of the final, the song performed in the tenth position (following Spain's Cadillac singing "Valentino" and preceding Israel's Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel with "Yavo Yom"), and at the close of the voting had received 140 points, placing 2nd in a field of 20.
In the song, Simmons sings about how she desires "love written in capital letters" from a man, and laments as to why this is not happening for her. She decries one-night stands and men treating women as if they are only "tricks coming from the disco," which caused a minor stir in French-speaking nations as Simmons uses mildly vulgar contemporary slang to describe such acts. The "pas pour moi" referenced in the song is Simmons telling the listener that she feels young people living a hedonistic existence with many sexual partners is "not for her." Throughout most of the song, Simmons plays the underlying melody herself on the piano.
It was succeeded as Swiss representative at the 1987 contest by Carol Rich with "Moitié, moitié".

TriadCity

TriadCity is an ambitious multi-user dungeon or MUD (a type of online role-playing game) with a strong emphasis on literary and philosophical themes. It is the flagship offering of the independent games company SmartMonsters and is currently in open beta. "TriadCity" has been cited in several scholarly forums for its literary merits, including the "Cambridge Companion to Postmodernism".
History.
Mark Phillips and Gary Smith, the creators of "TriadCity", met at Golden Gate University in 1994. Phillips had a background in network technology and experimental fiction. Smith was a veteran of the high-tech industry who had written his own Fortran version of the popular adventure game Zork in 1980, which he later ported to C++ and Visual Basic. Both were interested in designing a game where non-violent cooperative gameplay was more important than violence-based methods of character advancement. In 1999, Phillips and Smith incorporated the independent games company SmartMonsters for the purpose of developing such games. "TriadCity" is their flagship project.
Gameplay.
Interface.
"TriadCity" runs on an entirely original codebase. Gameplay is conducted through a proprietary Java client and involves many elements which are typical for a MUD such as the importance of role-play, social interaction through chat, and a text-based interface. Players familiar with the MUD genre may find the style of gameplay to be reminiscent of the popular DikuMUD or CircleMUD.
Character development.
Characters can take on a variety of genders including the familiar male, female, and hermaphrodite as well as such unfamiliar alternatives as splat (a noncommittal gender posture) and plural (characters which are a multitude of individuals). Characters are rewarded experience while playing the game for a variety of activities including simple acts of exploration and puzzle-solving. As in most MUDs, characters can eventually learn skills and adopt various roles including the somewhat familiar healer, warrior, and thief as well as the unfamiliar malopath (a kind of psychic vampire). Character advancement can often be furthered through the use of non-violent skills more effectively than it can through the use of violence, though in MUD tradition "TriadCity" does include combat among the activities available to characters. A prominent incentive for non-violence is the fact that character death is permanent in "TriadCity". Characters do not respawn when they die, so combat carries much greater risks than it does in most other MUDs. Cooperative gameplay is privileged over individualism, making "TriadCity" a sometimes difficult experience for lone wolf players.
The game world.
The game takes place within its namesake city, a massive urban environment featuring a blend of historic, modern, and fantastic design elements. At the center of the city is a safe haven called Sanctuary Island where characters first enter the world. The geography of the city divides into three large areas called the Thirds which can be reached from Sanctuary Island. The north-west third of the city is a participatory democracy which excels in the arts and sciences. The north-east third of the city is a senatorial republic which excels in private enterprise and athletics. The southern third of the city is governed by the infallible Central Computer which affords it citizens plenty of leisure time to enjoy their unprecedented technological achievements. The game world currently comprises about 16,000 finished rooms, but is expected to reach a size of around 100,000 rooms when complete. This will make "TriadCity" considerably larger than the average MUDs at its completion.
Novel features.
Subjectivity.
In "TriadCity" a character's experience of the world is colored by many things including their attributes and alignment. For example, a good character may see a room as dark and foreboding while an evil character may see that same room as plain and unexceptional. The resulting subjectivity of character experience is an enticing novelty of "TriadCity" which puts a powerful fictional tool in the hands of the game's authors.
Literary orientation.
The world of "TriadCity" is populated by an immense number of individual automata, many of which have been directly inspired by literature and other prominent forms of Western culture. Among the residents of the city are Friar Tuck, Hank Riordan, Arsene Lupin, Edna Pontellier, Tiresias, George of the Jungle, Jack Dawkins and many others; along with historical figures such as Alfred Jarry, Aristophanes, George Boole, Henry Ford, Israel Regardie, Saint Simon the Stylite, Suzanne Valadon, Spartacus, Francois Prelati, and more. There are locales within the world inspired by the work of Mark Twain and the occultism of Aleister Crowley as well as bots whose personalities are derived from the work of Douglas Adams and Oscar Wilde.
The juxtaposition of diverse literary and cultural references together with the subjectivity of character experience has led the creators of "TriadCity" to describe the game as a piece of interactive postmodern literature. This ambitious claim has been endorsed by the "Cambridge Companion to Postmodernism" which cites "TriadCity" as an example of new, emerging literary forms. The creators of the game, Mark Phillips and Gary Smith, were featured panelists at the Richard Hugo House Sixth Annual Inquiry, on the topic of games. "TriadCity" was also the featured topic of an article in the Winter 2005 BayNet Newsletter. It is cited in this course syllabus for English 597: Literature on the Web, at Western Michigan University; and this course syllabus for DANM132, Games as Literature: The Intersection of Writing and Play, at UC Santa Cruz.
Gender Parity.
There are currently about 10,000 registered players of TriadCity. Players are evenly divided between women and men, unusual for an online role-playing environment. Although the game is played in English, a high proportion of participants are from Europe.

CJC-1295

CJC-1295 is a tetrasubstituted 30-amino acid peptide hormone, primarily functioning as a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analog. It was invented by ConjuChem, a Canadian biotechnology company.
One of the advantages of CJC-1295 over traditional GHRH or rHGH is its ability to bioconjugate with serum albumin, thus increasing its half-life and therapeutic window. It accomplishes this by using protecting groups around the amino acids of GHRH typically susceptible to enzymatic degradation.
Bioconjugation.
The reason why CJC-1295 possesses the ability to lengthen the half-life within the active agent has to do with the scientific process known as bioconjugation. This technology, which is relatively new, is defined by its ability to take a reactive group and bond it to a peptide. This attachment causes a reaction with a nucleophilic unit, a typically partially molecule that is found within the bloodstream of an animal test subject. This reaction in turn causes a more stable bond to occur. This specific peptide has an especially high attraction to albumin, a globular protein that is soluble in water. This affinity prohibits natural degradation, which in turn increases the peptide’s half-life. Additionally, clinical research performed on animal test subjects has thus far shown that there have been no signs of DPP-IV degradation present when CJC-1295 was introduced.

Monticello Reservoir

Monticello is a reservoir in the U.S. state of South Carolina, built to provide water for the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station. It is located in Jenkinsville. While it does not dam any major rivers, its outflow flows directly into Parr Reservoir, an artificial lake created along the Broad River, via the Fairfield Pumped Storage power station.
The lake is mainly used to cool the turbines of a nearby nuclear power plant. It is famous locally for its catfishing, as some 60 lb. and up fish have been pulled from its waters.
Fluctuations in the level of the reservoir are thought to have increased the incidence of induced seismicity in the area.
The referenced study by Talwani actually states that after an initial increase, levels of seismicity at Monticello have returned to pre-reservoir levels. Therefore induced seismicity is linked with the initial impoundment, and is not an ongoing issue at this location.

JBT Corporation is an American food processing machinery and airport equipment company. JBT Corporation was incorporated in 2008 when FMC Technologies divested its non-energy businesses. JBT Corporation is based in Chicago, Illinois. Its Airport Equipment Division manufactures and services the Jetway brand of airport passenger loading bridges and other Ground Support Equipment such as Cargo Loaders, Deicers and pushback tractors.
History.
The Bean Spray Pump Company.
Founded in 1883 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, California by John Bean. The company's first product was a piston pump. Bean invented the pump to spray insecticide on the many fruit orchards in the area. A Bean sprayer is on display at the Forbes Mill museum there. Bean Avenue in downtown Los Gatos is named after John Bean.
FMC.
In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells, and changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC. FMC received a contract to design and build landing vehicles tracked for the United States War Department in 1941. FMC also built the M113 ("APC") Armored Personnel Carrier and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle as well as the XR311 at its former facility in Santa Clara, California. The troubled development of the Bradley was satirized in the 1998 HBO movie "The Pentagon Wars". In the movie FMC was fictionalized as A.O.C corporation. Bean also manufactured fire fighting equipment in the 1960s through the 1980s under the FMC and the Bean names. 
FMC also produced fire truck fire pumps and pumper bodies, and had an OEM arrangement with LTI (Ladder Towers Inc.) to market aerial ladders. In the early 1980s the Fire apparatus division of FMC tried to expand its role in aerial ladders on fire trucks, leveraging the Link-Belt crane division. FMC was ultimately unsuccessful in its expansion into production of aerial ladders. The FMC Fire Apparatus division was also ultimately shut down in 1990.
Spinoffs.
In 1946, FMC bought out Bolens Lawn And Garden Equipment. FMC changed names again in 1948, becoming Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation. In 1961 the name was changed to "FMC Corporation". 
In 1967, the FMC Corporation merged with the Link-Belt Company. The company produced FMC Link-Belt branded cranes and excavators. In 1986, the Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company was formed as a joint venture between FMC Corporation and Sumitomo Heavy Industries.
Between 1965 and 1985 FMC was the owner of the Gunderson metal works in Oregon USA, during that period it was known as the 'Marine and Rail Equipment Division of FMC' (MRED), it was sold in 1985 to The Greenbrier Companies.
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s (decade), FMC Corporation began spinning several of its divisions into separate companies, including United Defense and FMC Technologies, and selling its divisions, including the John Bean Company, now a subsidiary of Snap-on Equipment, a division of Snap-on. Bolens was sold to Troy Built in 1991.
On April 30, 2008, FMC Technologies announced the spinoff of its airport and food equipment businesses into a separate company named John Bean Technologies Corporation, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. JBT is named after the spray pump inventor whose business was the foundation of FMC Corp.
Organization.
JBT Corporation is organized in two business segments: JBT FoodTech and JBT AeroTech.
JBT FoodTech provides solutions and services for food processing companies. Markets served include:
JBT AeroTech markets solutions and services to airport authorities, airlines, airfreight and ground handling companies. Product offerings include:

Manuel Alonso Areizaga

Manuel Alonso de Areizaga (12 November 1895 – 11 October 1984) was a Spanish tennis player. He was the first Spanish tennis player of international stature.
Biography.
Alonso was born at San Sebastián on 12 November 1895. He won the Spanish tennis championships in 1915, 1919 and 1920. He frequently played doubles with his elder brother José María (b. 1890) who also was a successful tennis player.
In 1920, Alonso took part at the Summer Olympics at Antwerpen. In singles, he reached the quarterfinals losing to British Noel Turnbull. In doubles, he teamed with his brother José María but the pair lost its initial match. In the same year, Alonso reached the semifinal at the World Hard Court Championships. At the 1924 Summer Olympics at Paris, Alonso reached the fourth round in singles. In doubles, again along with his brother José María, both could advance to the quarterfinals.
In the early 1920s, Bill Tilden wrote about Alonso: "Seldom have I seen such wonderful natural abilities as are found in this young Spaniard [...] Alonzo has a terrific forehand drive that is the closest rival to W. M. Johnston's of any shot I have seen [...] His overhead is at once severe, deadly and reliable. He smashes with speed and direction. It is not only in his varied stroke equipment that Alonzo is great but in his marvellous footwork. Such speed of foot and lightning turning I have never before seen on a tennis court [...] I look to see Alonzo, who today loses matches through lack of resource, become by virtue of experience and tournament play the greatest player on the continent."
In 1921, at his first appearance at the Wimbledon Championships, Alonso made his way through to the all-comers final where he was eventually beaten by Brian Norton in five sets. He played at Wimbledon in 1922 and 1924 again, but couldn't repeat this success and dropped out of the competition in early rounds. From 1921 to 1925, Alonso was a member of the Spanish Davis Cup team and reached the final in 1922 partnering Manuel de Gomar. Both were called "Los Dos Manolos" ("the two Manuels"), a reference to the American "two Bills", "Big Bill" Tilden and "Little Bill" Johnston.
Alonso moved to the United States in 1923 which made him eligible for a U.S. ranking. He regularly played at the U.S. Championships until 1927 and reached the quarterfinals in 1922, 1923, 1925 and 1927. He was three years in the U.S. Top 10 (No. 4 in 1925 and 1927, No. 2 in 1926). In 1927, he was ranked World No. 5 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph. In 1931 and 1936, Alonso made two short appearances for his country in the Davis Cup again. Soon thereafter, he retired from tennis.
In 1977, a few years before his death, Alonso was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. He died on 11 October 1984 at Madrid.

The Musée de Minéralogie is a museum of mineralogy operated by the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris (Mines ParisTech). It is located in the 6th arrondissement at 60, boulevard Saint Michel, Paris, France, and open daily except Sunday and Monday; an admission fee is charged.
The school was established in 1783, and the museum itself in 1794 under René Just Haüy as a Cabinet of Mineralogy "containing all production in the world and all productions of the Republic, arranged by locality." It was quickly augmented by private collections, sometimes seized by the state. Many fine additions were made in short order, and by 1814 the museum contained about 100,000 samples at the Hotel de Mouchy. During the 19th century and early 20th century it continued to acquire excellent collections from around the world, interrupted for several decades by World War II, but then resuming. 
Today the museum is stated to be one of the ten largest mineral collections in the world, containing some 100,000 samples including 80,000 minerals, 15,000 rocks, 4,000 ores, 400 meteorites, 700 gems, and 300 artificial minerals.

Life and early career.
Born in Sakhejung in the Ilam District, Khanal was a member of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist), and was its General Secretary from 1982 to 1986; later, he was a member of the CPN (UML). Khanal served for a time as Minister of Information and Communication in the 1997 coalition government.

Prime Minister.
On 3 February 2011, after seven months of political gridlock in which no candidate could muster enough votes to be elected as Prime Minister, Jhala Nath Khanal was elected as Prime Minister by the Constituent Assembly. Khanal received 368 votes in the 601-member parliament, while his nearest rivals, Ram Chandra Poudel of the Nepali Congress and Bijay Kumar Gachhedar of Madhesi People's Rights Forum (Democratic), got 122 votes and 67 votes respectively.
Nepal had no proper government since Madhav Kumar Nepal resigned in June 2010. Sixteen rounds of voting in parliament since July were unable to produce a new prime minister as no political party could muster a majority. However, on 3 February 2011 the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (Nepal's largest party) withdrew its candidate, Pushpa Kamal Dahal (“Prachanda”), and backed Khanal, who as a result became the third Prime Minister of Nepal since it became a republic in 2008. 
Khanal's immediate tasks as Prime Minister included the preparation of a new republican constitution by a May 28 deadline, and negotiating the future of some 20,000 Maoist combatants.

Collision Course (Silverberg novel)

"Collision Course" details the response of the political leadership of Earth to an eventual collision of their aggressive expanding colonial empire with a newly discovered alien race.
Plot.
Spoiler Alert
The story is set in approximately the 26th century, after nearly five centuries of expansion into space limited by the speed of light, as ships with intrepid crews travel to new solar systems and install instantaneous transportation terminals known as transmats, which tie in with a system based on Earth. The current ruler, who leads a small group of men chosen and trained as leaders, is dissatisfied with the light barrier and upon becoming the leader -- the technarch -- he made a public address calling on science to find a way to exceed that barrier.
The first crewed FTL (faster-than-light) ship has reported in from its test flight, and upon landing, report their succesful voyage through an alternate universe to distant locations in the galaxy, and of discovering the outer reaches of an alien civilization. The technarch convenes a meeting of the ruling group, receive a report from the star crew, then deliberate the technarch's intention to negotiate a division of the galaxy between them. He selects four men to accompany the five star crew back out, although the crew are exhausted and not enthusiastic about another long trip.
The four men selected to go on the trip find they are very different in temperament and outlook, and tempers flare between two of them. They endure the long voyage that is unlike an instant transmat trip, and upon arrival, the crew meet the aliens. The linguist chosen by the technarch proceeds to teach the aliens English, then explain the situation about the expanding empires. The aliens say they cannot speak for their people and walk out, summoning more senior officials. The officials seem agreeable there should be no war, but impose not a division between the two peoples, rather, they tell Earth it can no longer expand, then they walk out.
The FTL ship crew agree to return home with the bad news, which they believe will lead to war, but they get lost in the alternate space and return to normal space in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The captain believes they should simply concede and find a place to live, even as the Milky Way tantalizes them in the sky of the planet they are borne to by a mysterious alien.
The Magellanic aliens summon the officials from Earth's opponents, and force an equal division of the Milky Way, then return the Milky Way citizens to where they were -- the FTL ship right back to where it was before its faulty attempt to return home. This time, the flight home proceeds correctly and they arrive to inform the technarch of the Magellanic aliens' enforcement that would prevent the technarch's dreams of human settlement in other galaxies.
Reception.
"Galaxy" reviewer Floyd C. Gale described the novel as "entertaining and deft", if glibly plotted, noting that it "benefits from [Silverberg's] sure control of pace."

Percival Goodhouse

Percival Goodhouse (c. 1752 - August 2, 1774) was one of the first patients admitted to the Public Hospital for Persons of Insane and Disordered Minds in Williamsburg, Virginia, after its opening on October 12, 1773. A paranoid schizophrenic, Goodhouse escaped the asylum shortly after his admittance and fled to the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg. He was found in the Palace's garden maze, clutching a large knife. Goodhouse was tried and convicted of treason for attempting to assassinate the governor (John Murray, Lord Dunmore) and was hanged on August 2, 1774. His body was left to rot in a field just beyond the old College campus. Students often uncovered his remains as a prank.
Several instances of supposed ghost sightings in the garden maze have been attributed to Goodhouse. One account describes the encounter of a student from the College of William & Mary with a pair of "milky, white, transparent" feet which disappeared upon closer examination. Another story, concerning the murder of a female student in the 1960s, has sometimes been mistakenly associated with Goodhouse.

Parr Reservoir or Parr Shoals Reservoir is an impoundment of the Broad River in Peak, South Carolina. It is the last dam on the Broad River before the river reaches Columbia, South Carolina and the Columbia Canal. The lake is mainly used as a holding pond of sorts, as the water is pulled in and out and used to cool the turbines of a nearby nuclear power plant. Some anglers will fish for catfish in the main river channel, while bass fishing is mainly held back to Heller's and Cannon creeks, as well as the tailrace below Lake Monticello. Because of fluctuating water levels, and millions of submerged trees lurking underneath the shallow water, it is an extremely dangerous body of water to fish.

The Scottish Liberal Party was the dominant political party of Victorian Scotland, and although its importance declined with the rise of the Labour and Unionist parties during the 20th century, it was still a significant force when it finally merged with the Social Democratic Party in Scotland, to form the Scottish Liberal Democrats in 1988.
The party reached its low point during the 1950s, when Jo Grimond was the sole Scottish Liberal MP in the House of Commons, but it gained a partial revival in the 1964 general election when it gained three further MPs, George Mackie, Russell Johnston and Alasdair Mackenzie. A further gain came the following year with David Steel's victory at the Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election. Steel went on to become a pivotal figure in the development of Scottish devolution, in partnership with John Smith, Donald Dewar and other key Labour and Liberal figures.

Orpheus (Liszt)

Franz Liszt composed his Orpheus in 1853-4, numbering it No. 4 in his cycle of 12 symphonic poems written during his time in Weimar, Germany. It was first performed on February 16, 1854, conducted by the composer, as an introduction to the first Weimar performance of Christoph Willibald Gluck's opera "Orfeo ed Euridice". The performance helped celebrate the birthday of Weimar's Grand Duchess Maria Pawlowna, who was an amateur musician and a staunch supporter of Liszt at Weimar.
Overview.
Program.
"Orpheus" is one of four symphonic poems Liszt composed as character sketches of men of creative genius, heroism or legend. (The other three poems are "Tasso", "Prometheus" and "Mazeppa".) In his preface Liszt describes an Etruscan vase depicting Orpheus, then extols civilizing effect on humanity. This reference to the ennobling effect of Orpheus and his art may have been derived from the Orpheus depicted by the Lyon philosopher Pierre-Simon Ballanche in "Orphée" in 1829. By introducing civilised laws, the Orpheus of this nine-volume work leads humanity into the modern age; this was intended by Ballanche to provide a new philosophy for all of Europe. Liszt was an acquaintance and supporter of Ballanche, and Liszt's enthusiasm was shared by members of the French salons during the 1830s, especially by George Sand.
Instrumentation.
Especially noteworthy is "Orpheus's" instrumentation, which includes two harps; their representation of Orpheus's lyre in the opening 14 bars immediately focuses the listener's attention on this instrument. Harpist Jeanne Pohl, one of the new virtuoso players brought to Weimar by Liszt to augment the court orchestra, inspired the composer to pen these effects.
Structure.
"Orpheus" is not a long work and takes the form of a gradual crescendo followed by a quiet ending which returns to the mood of the opening. Unlike many of Liszt's other symphonic poems, the music here remains largely contemplative. For this reason, it became a favorite piece of Liszt's son-in-law, the composer Richard Wagner.
Formally, "Orpheus" is a modified sonata form with a secondary key area containing two themes. The second theme lacks the energy of the first, remaining a static motif hovering over oscillating major and minor harmonies. Nevertheless, it contains an especially poignant quality. This theme is presented by various solo instruments to a primarily harp accompaniment. The orchestration, together with the style, suggests an interpretation of this theme as Orpheus' voice.
The ethereal, chromatic ascent in the final bars attenuates any decisive closure that could be expected from a more conventional harmonic resolution. Combined with the closing theme of the second group, this ends the work as a cryptic vision which recalls the final moments of Ballanche's story. There the story's narrator, Thamyris, witnesses Orpheus disappearing into the clouds, leaving mankind the task of developing his teachings of civilisation.

Pandurang Sadashiv Khankhoje

Pandurang Sadashiv Khankhoje (7 November 1884 – 22 January 1967) was an Indian revolutionary, scholar, agricultural scientist and historian who was among the founding fathers of the Ghadar Party.
Khankhoje was born in November 1884 to a Marathi Brahmin family at Wardha, where his father worked as a petition-writer. Young Khankhoje spent his childhood in Wardha, where he completed his primary and middle school education before moving to Nagpur for higher education. He was at the time inspired by the nationalist work of Bal Gangadhar Tilak. At some time in the first decade of 1900s, Khankhoje left India on a voyage that ultimately saw him settle in the United States. Here he enrolled in the Oregon Agricultural College (now called Oregon State University), graduating in 1911. His earliest nationalist work abroad dates back to the time around 1908 when he, along with Pandit Kanshi Ram founded the Indian Independence League in Portland, Oregon. His works also brought him close to other Indian nationalists in United States at the time, including Taraknath Das. In the years preceding World War I, Khankhoje was one of the founding members of the Pacific coast Hindustan association, and subsequently founded the Ghadar Party. He was at the time one of the most influential members of the party. He met Lala Har Dayal in 1911. He also enrolled at one point in a West Coast military academy. 
Through World War I, Khankhoje was intricately involved in the Hindu-German Conspiracy when he was involved in the plans for the mutiny. He had joined a western He visited Europe during the war and subsequently went to Mesopotamia along with other members of what was the Berlin Committee. In the summer of 1915, he worked clandestinely among roops of the Indian expeditionary force, spreading nationalist literature and hoping to incite a mutiny. Through the course of the war, Khankhoje made his way through Turkey and Persia under different Muslim guises as far as Baluchistan, spreading Ghadarite propaganda en route. He is known to have attempted insurrections and raised at the Iran-Baluchistan border while Mahendra Pratap's Indo-German expedition attempted to rally the Afghan Emir Habibullah Khan against British India. Towards the end of the war, Khankhoje, like most of the members of the Berlin committee, began turing towards communism. He is known to have been in Soviet Union in company of the earliest Indian communist, including Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, M. P. T. Acharya, M. N. Roy, Abdur Rab Barq. He met Lenin at Moscow in 1921. For his nationalist work at the time, Khankoje was banned from returning to India as a highly dangerous individual. 
Khankhoje later moved to Mexico in the 1920s, where he was instated the professor of Botany and Crop Breeding in the National School of Agriculture in Mexico. In 1936, Khankhoje married Jean Alexandrine Sindic, a Belgian women in Mexico by whom he had two daughters. He led the Mexican corn breeding program and was appointed director to the Mexican Government's department of Agriculture. Both Pandurang and Jean returned to India after 1947. His application for visa was initially rejected by the Indian government due to the ban by the British Indian Government, but was eventually overturned. He settled in Nagpur and subsequently embarked on a political career. Pandurang Khankhoje died on January 22, 1967.

Marker vaccine

A marker vaccine is a vaccine which allows for the differentiation between infected and vaccinated subjects. Most vaccines are inactivated or attenuated forms of the targeted virus, therefore it is impossible to differentiate by laboratory tests which subjects are infected or only vaccinated. Marker vaccines, being a form of the virus without a particular gene coding for a non protective antigen so, do not produce a key antibody, while still protecting against the disease. Laboratory tests can test for the absence of the antibody, confirming whether the individual has vaccinated or is genuinely infected and needs treatment.

Isaqueena Falls, located near Walhalla, South Carolina, is a waterfall in the Oconee District of the Sumter National Forest. The falls are named after a Cherokee girl who allegedly leaped from the top of the falls with her lover, an Oconee brave, in an attempt to hide him from the rest of her tribe, which was at war with the Oconee. Isaqueena allegedly then hid him in the recessed area just below the top of the falls. It is very close to Stumphouse Tunnel, another notable local landmark.

Highland Park Masonic Temple

The Highland Park Masonic Temple, also known as The Mason Building or The Highlands, is a historic three-story brick building on Figueroa Street in the Highland Park district of northeast Los Angeles, California.
History.
Completed in 1923, the 'Commercial/Renaissance Revival' style building served as Lodge 382 of the Free and Accepted Masons for sixty years. The original structure included retail shops on the ground floor with the lodge and banquet hall on the second floor. In 1983, the Masons were forced to vacate the structure when they were unable to afford the cost of retrofitting the building to meet seismic safety requirements. The building was purchased by private developers, and the second floor was converted into a banquet facility. The original Lodge Room, with its cherry wood paneling, anaglypta wall coverings, and other details has been restored and preserved and remains in use as a banquet facility.
Architecture and construction.
The building was designed by Elmore Robinson Jeffrey in the Chicago school commercial—Renaissance Revival style with much of the architectural detailing in the Mediterranean Revival style. The 'Commercial/Renaissance Revival' style was popular in Los Angeles during the 1920s. 
The Highland Park Masonic Temple was built from 1922–1923 and opened in July 1923. The three-story structure was built for use by the Free and Accepted Masons as the site for Lodge 382. The Masons occupied the second and third floors, and the first floor was retail space, providing an income source for the lodge.
The most impressive room in the building is the Lodge Room on the second floor. The Lodge Room has an ceiling and rich cherry wood paneling, original embossed cotton anaglypta, and paintings at both ends of the hall depicting Egyptian scenes, including a sphinx and pyramid. There was originally a second story arched balcony/arcade connecting the Lodge Room with the Banquet Hall.
Other significant architectural features include a beautiful frieze featuring Masonic symbols running along the exterior roofline of the building along Figueroa Street and Avenue 56. From the exterior, the most impressive feature is the Figueroa Street facade with its the columns and balcony at the eastern edge of the Banquet Hall.
Use of the building.
Masonic Lodge 382.
The Masons used the building as Lodge 382 and several other lodges for 60 years from 1923 to 1983. However, in 1983, the owners were cited for failure to bring the building up to modern seismic safety standards. The local Masonic unit lacked the funds to undertake the expensive seismic work and were forced to vacate and sell the building.
Renovation as a mixed use and banquet facility.
In 1983, Allen Golden, along with partners Jerry Sullivan and Jerry Manpearl, purchased the building. They undertook extensive renovation of the building between 1985 and 1989, including upgrade work to enable the structure to meet modern seismic safety requirements. As part of the renovation work, the owners replaced awnings that had been part of the original design, and leaded glass that had been covered was exposed. Additionally, during the seismic retrofit, care was taken to preserve numerous period details, including doorknobs embossed with Masonic symbols, the cherry wood paneling and the anaglypta wall covering.
The renovated building opened in January 1990, with the second floor converted into a community meeting place and banquet hall. The Lodge Room was preserved much as it was in 1923. However, the chandeliers in the Lodge Room were replaced in the 1950s or 1960s with green light fixtures; the new owners installed antique light fixtures in the room as part of their restoration project. The Banquet Hall (in the front of the building along Figueroa) has been converted into a wood-floored multi-purpose room. The two large second floor rooms are now rented to the public for wedding receptions, anniversaries, quinceañeras, and other functions.
The third floor was converted to office space, rented initially to Operation Headstart. In order to make room for offices on the third floor, an interior balcony overlooking the Lodge Room and Banquet Hall had to be removed -- one of the few sacrifices made to preservation.
Historic designation.
The building was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1984 (HCM #282), and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

Iranians in France

Iranians in France form one of the smaller communities of Iranians outside of Iran.
Early 20th century.
France was a popular destination for Persian (Iranian) international students in the early 20th century. The first government-sponsored Persian students, a group of 20, all went to France in 1926. In 1932, the Pahlavi government drew up a competitive examination to determine the distribution of government scholarships to aspiring international students; 110 out of the 125 students who passed the examination went to France, making them the overwhelming majority of all Persian students abroad. Another 66 chose France as their destination the following year. Aside from government-sponsored students, there were also 537 privately financed Persian students living in France in 1934, nearly half of the total 1,165 privately financed international students. However, in 1938, a governmental decree prohibited students from going abroad on private funds to pursue degrees. The Iranian students in France lived in dormitories on their school campuses, unlike Iranian students in Germany who rented private accommodations by themselves; this meant that they were often subject to surveillance by officials from the Iranian embassy, and prevented the growth of anti-Pahlavi activism among them. Germany, rather than France, would thus become the major European centre of Iranian dissent in the 1930s.
Notable Iranians who studied in France include Mehdi Bazargan, the first Iranian to pass the entrance examination to any of the "grandes écoles"; he went on to become prime minister of Iran after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
After the Iranian Revolution.
Today, Iranians in France consist primarily of "political emigrants", who left Iran immediately after the revolution, because their association with communists, monarchists, or other opposition groups put them in danger, and "socio-cultural emigrants"—especially women and youths—who had little political affiliation but left Iran more slowly in the years following the revolution due to despair over the future of Iranian society. France expelled some of the political migrants, including Massoud Rajavi and his People's Mujahedin of Iran, in an effort to improve relations with Iran and secure the release of French hostages held by pro-Iranian forces in Lebanon.

Steer Madness

Steer Madness is an animal rights inspired adventure video game developed and published by Veggie Games Inc. The game was released in December 2004 on CD-ROM for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh.
Gameplay.
"Steer Madness" is a single-player game where the player assumes the role of Bryce the Cow, a walking, talking bovine determined to put an end to animal exploitation and turn everyone vegetarian. During gameplay, the player goes on a series of missions to save the animals using many different tactics. The game is based in an open city environment and features several transportation methods, with gameplay similar to the game Grand Theft Auto (without the guns or violence). Players have the option to walk, use a bicycle or drive (in select missions) through the city to get to different areas of the game. Missions involve many gameplay elements, including climbing, jumping, racing, puzzle solving and operating heavy machinery.
Development.
"Steer Madness" was developed in Vancouver, BC, Canada, by the independent game developer Veggie Games Inc. The majority of the game was made by just one person, Veggie Games Inc. founder Johnathan Skinner. This includes all of the programming (which was done from scratch), story, design and a significant portion of the artwork. He worked on the game in his spare time for about a year and a half while working other jobs, then decided to focus all his time into finishing and publishing the game. He registered the company (Veggie Games Inc), got a small office and hired an artist to help. After about 6 months of full-time development and the help of a few student interns, the game was complete and ready for release.
Music for the game was licensed from local independent artists, including Angie Inglis, Anita Athavale, Feisty, Hector and The Winks. Voice acting was done with the help of friends who were convinced to read lines into a microphone while sitting inside a little box which was sound-proofed with swatches of carpet and pillows.
Taking the self-publishing route, game CDs were printed in small batches and sold through the website. Various animal rights groups in Canada, USA, UK and Germany purchased wholesale quantities in order to resell the game CDs through their online stores as a form of fundraising.
Awards.
"Steer Madness" received two awards shortly after it was released. The first award was "Best Animal-Friendly Video Game" from the 2004 PETA Proggy Awards, and the second was "Innovation in Audio" from the 2005 Independent Games Festival.

Diamondback (roller coaster)

Diamondback is a steel roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio, United States. The ride is located in Rivertown just behind International Street and the Eiffel Tower. When built in 2009, it was the first hyper coaster to feature a splashdown and the first Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster at Kings Island. Diamondback was the biggest investment in Kings Island’s history at $22 million (ahead of The Crypt and Son of Beast, each of which cost $20 million). The coaster has a lift hill with a 215 ft-drop, featuring 10 total drops and a top speed of about . It is similar to Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland in statistics, layout, and seating.
History.
Construction of Diamondback began on October 11, 2007, with the removal of a tree. Swan Lake was drained and filled with concrete before opening day in 2008, this turned out to be location for the splashdown element. Kings Island started teasing visitors during the Fourth of July weekend in 2008 with signs saying, "Ride sally ride" and "Steep incline ahead." Diamondback was announced on August 6, 2008 as the largest investment in Kings Island history. The ride was topped off with the lift hill on October 30. The last piece of track was installed on January 26, 2009. Diamondback started testing about a month later on February 26. Diamondback officially opened on April 18, 2009. The 1,000,000th rider was on July 20, 2009.
First rider auction.
On February 3, 2009, Kings Island announced they would hold an auction for the first riders on Diamondback. The winners of the auction would be given a commemorative first rider ticket, a special gift from the park, and an admission ticket. All proceeds from the auction would go to "A Kid Again" non-profit organization, formerly known as "Adventures for Wish Kids". The first rider auction raised $102,000. The first eight trains, or the first 256 seats were auctioned off. The average bid was $398 per seat.
Ride experience.
Layout.
After the train leaves the station, it begins its ascent up the chain lift hill. Once reaching the top of the hill, the coaster drops at 74° over the Rivertown midway. It then curves to the right up a hill and down the drop into the ravine, curving again to the left. The ride then ascends a camelback hill and drops, curiving left into the hammerhead turn. After dropping out of the hammerhead, the train travels up a hill (which has a trim brake). After the fourth hill, the train turns into down into a 287° counter-clockwise helix (on-ride photo camera is here) and into the mid-course brake run. After the short brake run the train drops down into the ravine, raising into a bunny hop hill, then into another bunny hop and into the final clockwise helix of 323°. After the final helix, the train passes over the Rivertown midway a second time and drops into the splashdown finale, slowing the train down and leading it into the final brake run. After braking, the train takes a left U-turn and heads back into the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 3 minutes.
Splashdown.
Diamondback is the first hyper coaster to feature a splashdown. Scoops positioned at the back sides of the last car on each train send water soaring at heights of as the train passes. The riders don’t actually get wet in the splashdown. Splashdowns are used for a visual effect as well to slow the train down. The splashdown is located in the former Swan Boat pond.
Trains.
"Diamondback" operates with three open-air stadium style steel and fiberglass trains. The trains are the same prototype trains seen on "Behemoth" at Canada's Wonderland, "Intimidator" at Carowinds and "" at PortAventura. Diamondback was the first roller coaster in the United States to feature the new trains. Each car seats four passengers, with two front seats set near the middle of the car and two rear seats set closer to the sides of the car. The front car of each train features a yellow/orange snake head with long fangs, while the inside of the trains are black, red, and orange. Riders are restrained by a single T-shaped lap bar. There are three trains total, each train featuring a different fin color: green, red, or brown. Under the sides of the last car on each train are the scoops for the splashdown at the end.
Track.
The steel track is in length and the height of the lift is approximately . The supports on the first lift hill and part of the second hill are yellow while the rest of the supports are tan. All of the track pieces are red. The track was fabricated at the Ohio-based Clermont Steel Fabricators.

Austrian Death Machine

Austrian Death Machine is an American metal side project from San Diego, California, founded by As I Lay Dying vocalist Tim Lambesis to be a parody of and tribute to Arnold Schwarzenegger's films.
Biography.
Austrian Death Machine released their first album "Total Brutal" on July 22, 2008. The album was dedicated to Caleb Crain on May 14, 2008 for his birthday that was two months before the scheduled release date. A few months later they released a Christmas themed EP titled A Very Brutal Christmas. After some tour support of "Total Brutal," Lambesis went back on tour with As I Lay Dying. While on tour he posted on Austrian Death Machine's MySpace blog that he had ideas to follow up "Total Brutal" with a double disc effort titled "Double Brutal" stating that the first disc would be original songs where the second disc would be composed of cover songs. After returning home from tour in early Summer 2009, he went to work on "Double Brutal" which was released September 29, 2009.
Many in the press have pointed out that a Schwarzenegger movie-themed band concept was already being pursued by ArnoCorps, having been performing live in California and the UK beginning more than seven years prior to Lambesis' effort. Lambesis writes and records all the music playing guitar, bass, and drums as well as the majority of the vocals, leaving Destroy the Runner vocalist Chad Ackerman (portraying "Ahhhnold") to perform Schwarzenegger-like vocals. The only thing Lambesis or Ackerman do not record are the guitar solos in every song which are performed by various guitarists from other bands. Lambesis stated where As I Lay Dying "is heartfelt and full of passion" Austrian Death Machine on the other hand "is an outlet of pure testosterone and stupidity."
Tim Lambesis is still considering calling Austrian Death Machine's third album "Keep It Brutal", but welcomes suggestions. As of December 5, 2012, production on a third album has begun. It was announced on February 19, 2013, that their third studio album would be entitled "Triple Brutal".
The band plans to release the album in the near future despite Lambesis' May 7, 2013 arrest for allegedly attempting to hire a hitman to murder his estranged wife. It was announced in 2014, that "Triple Brutal" would be released on April 1, 2014, on Artery Recordings.

Iraqi presidential referendum, 1995

The Iraqi presidential election of 1995 took place on October 15 of that year. It was the first direct presidential election under the rule of Saddam Hussein, who had seized power through the Revolutionary Command Council in 1979. Taking the form of a referendum with no other candidates, the election involved giving voters paper ballots that said: "Do you approve of President Saddam Hussein being the President of the Republic?" They then used pens to mark "yes" or "no". The next day, Izzat Ibrahim, Hussein's deputy in the ruling Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), announced the incumbent had won 99.96% of some 8.4 million valid votes cast. Officially, 3,052 people voted against him (45 of them in Baghdad), and turnout was 99.47%. The international community reacted with widespread incredulity to these figures.
Background.
The election was prompted by the August defection to Jordan of senior government officials Hussein Kamel al-Majid and Saddam Kamel and their wives. During the crisis that followed, Saddam took steps to control the damage; the referendum was an attempt to shore up his claim to legitimacy. At a September 7 meeting of the RCC, an interim amendment to the Constitution was approved whereby its chairman would automatically assume the presidency, subject to approval of the National Assembly and endorsement by national plebiscite. Parliament approved his candidacy on September 10, setting the stage for the meticulously organised election.
Prior to the election, Baath Party members visited homes, making sure to ask if households had ration cards (at the time, food was scarce as a result of the Iraq sanctions); the clear implication was that the wrong kind of vote could mean no food. Voters were required to name relatives on their ballots and, according to some opposition reports, were threatened with punishment against their families if they voted "no". In a November report, the UN Special Rapporteur noted that because of the intrusiveness of the security apparatus "virtually no citizen would risk demonstrating any opposition to the Presidency or Government—or would do so at his mortal peril"; the notion that opponents would face some sort of retribution was shared by most observers. During the election, which served to emphasize that the Baath Party and the RCC were the country's true centres of power, loyal and tenacious party cadres brought voters in droves to the polling stations, themselves swamped with pro-Hussein propaganda. The result confirmed that Iraqis' fear of Saddam was greater than the severe hardship that had resulted from the sanctions.
Preparations.
The campaign involved unending glorification of Saddam; for instance, General Ali Hassan al-Majid declared, "O lofty mountain! O glory of Iraq! By God we have always found you in the most difficult conditions a roaring lion and a courageous horseman, one of the few true men". Saddam himself never appeared in public prior to the election, but paid supporters streamed through the streets, shouting "Naam, naam, Saddam" ("Yes, yes, Saddam"). A highlight came four days prior to the vote at an Iraq-Qatar football game, when a dejected, pensive-looking Uday Hussein (normally glamorized) was shown on television, upset by what the announcer claimed was a (probably fictitious) fire that Saddam had set to his expensive cars as punishment for attacking Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti and for the defections; soon afterward, Uday's role was increased as he sought to lure the men and their wives back to Iraq.
Confident of popular participation, the government invited some 500 foreign journalists to witness the exercise; turnout (at least in Baghdad) was large enough to impress the visiting reporters, although the official figure was doubtless exaggerated. One Western ambassador was impressed by the show of force involved, including a unanimous vote from Karbala (centre of the 1991 Shiite uprising against Saddam): "If this referendum proves anything, it is that the party is firmly in control of Iraq and Saddam runs it with an iron fist. If they can organize a referendum like this in less than three weeks, mobilize party cadres in every village, hamlet, town and city, produce precise lists for eight million voters and march all of them to the polls to say 'yes' unanimously, it means they are not about to fall".
Unfolding.
The most common sentiment heard from ordinary voters was that Saddam had managed to keep the country together and provided strong leadership, implying his overthrow would lead to the sort of chaos seen in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Lebanon. The top foreign observer was nationalist Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who was treated to a palace feast with Hussein, Tariq Aziz and other top officials shortly before voting began. Following the election, on October 17 Hussein was sworn into his new term in a televised ceremony; Aziz pledged political reforms, including parliamentary elections that took place the following year.

Highways to a War

Highways to a War is a Miles Franklin Award-winning novel by Australian author Christopher Koch. 
In an interview in 2000, Koch noted that this novel, and his later work "Out of Ireland", formed a diptych called "Beware of the Past".
Plot summary.
When legendary Australian war photographer Mike Langford goes missing in Khmer Rouge Cambodia in 1976, childhood friend Ray inherits his taped diaries. Using these, his own memories, and the recollections and records of others, Ray attempts to reconstruct Langford's life, to understand how he became a myth and why he went back into Cambodia. Eventually this will lead Ray to Thailand, to the Cambodian border and the truth about Langford's fate. 
Though different parts of "Highways to a War" are told from different perspectives, the overall result is a coherent narrative and a portrait of a life. It begins with Langford's childhood on a Tasmanian farm, his "novitiate" in Singapore, where he nearly starves before finding work, and his early experiences in Vietnam, in Saigon and in the Mekong Delta with the ARVN, the South Vietnamese army. The story then jumps from Saigon in 1966 to Phnom Penh in 1973. Among other dramatic episodes, Langford is captured by North Vietnamese troops and witnesses the fall of Saigon. The story is tense and gripping, but the centre remains Langford's development: he is a tough man, a survivor, but he is also an idealist and, when he loses his objectivity and becomes involved with the Free Khmer, his fate has a tragic inevitability to it. 
Its unity comes from its focus on Langford, but "Highways to a War" has plenty of other memorable characters. His fellow photographers and correspondents are a fascinatingly idiosyncratic bunch. And Langford's romantic idealisation of women makes them a key part of his life: in Australia, the daughter of a poor fruit-picking family and then the wife of his mentor, in Saigon an older French-Vietnamese woman, and in Phnom Penh the Cambodian woman whose fate becomes tied up with Langford's. 
"Highways to a War" also offers a vivid perspective on the course of the Second Indochina War. This, however, is implicit: Koch makes no attempt to write a history of that war (and readers without any background knowledge may find parts of the novel confusing), or to take sides in the debates over that history, and it is through personal stories and personal tragedies that he sheds light on the broader tragedies.

Autostrada A18 (Italy)

The Autostrada A18 is a motorway on the Ionian coast of Sicily that links Messina to Catania. The motorway is linked to the A20 Messina-Palermo at its northern-end and to the A19 Palermo-Catania through the RA15 Catania's Ring Road at its southern-end. There is also a second stretch of A18, on the south part of the island, running from Syracuse to Rosolini.
Siracusa – Ragusa – Gela.
A first part of only 9,5 km from Syracuse to Cassibile opened 15 June 1983 but works stopped for over 20 years until in March 2008 a second stretch from Cassibile to Noto was open. The latest part, from Noto to Rosolini, was open to the traffic in October 2008.
Rosolini – Ragusa.
This part of the A18 was designed in the early '70s and required re-planning because the original project would have run through archeological areas and natural reserves (created in the '80s and '90s). The new project was completed in 2001 and is partially financed. Works should start in 2013 taking the motorway from Rosolini to Ispica/Pozzallo first and to Modica. Authorities are awaiting for further founding for the completion of this second part of the A18 that should run to Scicli and Ragusa.

Musée de la Vie Romantique

The Musée de la Vie romantique (The Museum of Romantic Life, or "Museum of Romantics") stands at the foot of Montmartre hill in the IXe arrondissement, 16 rue Chaptal, Paris, France in an 1830 "hôtel particulier" facing two twin-studios, a greenhouse, a small garden, and a paved courtyard. The museum is open daily except Monday. Permanent collections are free. An admission fee is charged for temporary exhibitions. The nearest métro stations are Pigalle, Blanche, Saint-Georges, and Liège.
The Museum of Romantics is one of the 14 City of Paris' Museums that have been incorporated since January 1, 2013 in the public institution Paris Musées.
The property.
The main pavilion, built in 1830, was the Paris base of the Dutch-born painter Ary Scheffer (1795–1858), one of the prominent artists of the time, close to King Louis-Philippe and his family. For decades, Scheffer and his daughter hosted Friday-evening salons, among the most famous in "La Nouvelle Athènes". George Sand (1804–1876) used to come as a neighbour with Frédéric Chopin, meeting Eugène Delacroix, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Alphonse de Lamartine, Franz Liszt, Gioacchino Rossini and singer Pauline Viardot. Later in the century, Charles Dickens, Ivan Turgueniev, and Charles Gounod attended regularly.
The museum.
The property remained by descent in private hands till 1982 when it became a museum, under the name of "Musée Renan-Scheffer". It is now one of the City of Paris' three literary museums, along with the Maison de Balzac and the Maison de Victor Hugo.
After an extensive renovation conducted by Jacques Garcia under the direction of Anne-Marie de Brem, it reopened in 1987 as "Musée de la Vie romantique". Daniel Marchesseau, conservateur général du Patrimoine, has been appointed director in November 1998. Since then, he has developed an ambitious program of exhibitions and acquisitions. Attendance has widely grown, from 18.000 visitors a year (1998) to 145.000 in 2010.
The collections.
The Museum displays on the first floor numerous mementos of most notorious romantic character and writer George Sand, including family portraits, household possessions, pieces of jewelry and memorabilia among which plaster casts by Clésinger of the writer's sensuous right arm and Chopin's delicate left hand, plus a number of her own unique and rare watercolours called "dendrites".
On the second floor, one can admire a number of Romantic canvases, sculptures and objets d'art.
The Museum also displays several portraits and material related to the famous scholar and writer Ernest Renan who had married Ary Scheffer's niece.

Also an additional 8 weeks of Field Training, in which new officers must satisfactory complete in part of their supplemental training. For those seeking the certification, Bicycle Training and Radar Training are also provided.
History.
When the island was first developed/opened to the public for housing by the "Roosevelt Island Development Corp", security on the island was handled by security guards contracted by "RIDC". The firm was City Security Guards Inc. from 1976–1978. Then in 1978 the contract was terminated and a full service police force was formed and law enforcement was handled by the Roosevelt Island Police Department (RIPD) from 1979–1981. In 1981 a name change happened and RIDC transferred all officers to the "NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal Police" (NYS DHCR Police) from 1981 to approx. 1985. Both police departments were staffed by peace officers, and members had statewide jurisdiction and powers both on and off duty. Officers were armed with standard issue .38 special revolvers. Originally, RIPD/DHCRPD had state jurisdiction since they were employed as state officers. In 1984, the "Roosevelt Island Operating Corp." was formed and all island operations were transferred to it. Not long after that (in 1985) the DHCR Police were disbanded and Officers/Sergeants/Lieutenants/Captains could remain as Security Guards for "RIOC" or could join the NYS Department of Correctional Services. Most officers went to the NYPD, New York City Transit Police, and New York City Housing Authority Police Department, and only two or three went to New York State Department of Corrections. The officers who stayed were now part of RIOC Security, with no special patrolman status, no guns, and security type uniforms. Then about a year or two later, after residents demanded a more professional, police-type force, RIOC formed the Roosevelt Island Public Safety Department. Their first patrol cars were red Ford Jeeps and uniforms were changed to NYPD-style uniforms. They were given New York State Peace Officer powers and certain equipment but were still unarmed. The RIPD cars looked like the Port Authority's police cars. They were blue with yellow tops and gray lines with the words "Roosevelt Island Police" written in red lettering, The color was changed in 1980 to white and a van was added. Then they switched from RIPD to a name change of NYS DHCR Police [1981–1985. Those cars looked like modern day state trooper cars. Same graphics, colors, (actually, instead of navy blue the cars were black with gold stripes) and where it says "State Trooper" it said "DHCR POLICE". In 1986, in the wake of a major news story story on a duplication of services by a town police department in upstate New York, then-Governor Mario Cuomo started an investigation on duplicated services for police departments, and since Roosevelt Island was in New York City, the New York City Police Department is the responsible law enforcement agency on the island, Cuomo then disbanded about 15 police departments total in the state, with DHCRPD being one. RIOC concurred with this move in order to have autonomy of their own Public Safety Department. At present, their vehicles are SUV's.
Rank structure.
There are seven titles (referred to as ranks) in the Roosevelt Island Public Safety Department:
Excessive force complaints.
Some residents have accused the RIPSD of a pattern of violent behavior towards residents, and making overly aggressive, unnecessary arrests. In a February 6, 2013, public meeting, the Roosevelt Island Residents Association Common Council, which includes elected representatives from most buildings, called for the removal of the Director and his Deputy. In one specific case, a resident, Anthony Jones, 20, was arrested on January 13, 2013, on Trespass and Resisting Arrest charges. The Manhattan District Attorney's office refused to prosecute the case, and the charges were dropped. Jones said that after handcuffing him, Public Safety officers threw him to the ground, beat and kicked him. Jones was hospitalized with a punctured lung, and is suing the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation. Other residents complained of being arrested and roughly handled on charges that were eventually dismissed.

Chez Reavie

William Chesney "Chez" Reavie (born November 12, 1981) is an American professional golfer. 
Reavie was born in Wichita, Kansas. He played college golf at Arizona State University.
Reavie was a rookie member of the PGA Tour in 2008. He finished 18th on the money list on the Nationwide Tour in 2007 to earn his card. He played on the Nationwide Tour from 2005 through 2007. On July 27, 2008, Reavie won the 2008 RBC Canadian Open. The win, his first on the PGA Tour, earned him $900,000 and a two-year exemption to remain on the Tour. Knee surgery limited Reavie in 2010 and he began the 2011 season on a major medical exemption where he had thirteen events to keep his Tour Card. Reavie did not earn enough to retain full tour privileges, but by merely making the cut at the 2011 Memorial Tournament (the final start of his exemption), he earned conditional status for the rest of 2011. Reavie still managed to play in 22 events, making 15 cuts, and placing high enough to earn a spot in the FedEx Cup playoffs. His earnings of over one million dollars prior to the FedEx Cup secured his 2012 Tour Card. He nearly won his first event in over three years at the 2011 Deutsche Bank Championship, but had problems on the 18th hole before losing to Webb Simpson on the second playoff hole. He would finish 10th in the FedEx Cup, 34th on the money list with $2,285,067, and an OWGR rank of 67th after ending 2010 762nd in the world.
After a mediocre 2012 saw Reavie finish 135th on the money list, he went back to Q School to regain his Tour card. He finished T22 and is one of the last players and last former PGA Tour winner to earn a Tour card through Q School.

Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado

Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado (1530–1593) was a Spanish captain who was one of the more successful soldiers in the Arauco War in Chile rising to the rank of Maestre de Campo and temporary Capitán General of the Captaincy General of Chile. 
Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado was born in Cantalapiedra, Salamanca in 1530. He was the son of Francisco Martinez Nieto and Ana Bernal del Mercado. He traveled to the Americas in 1541 with the expedition of Blasco Nuñez de Vela, recently named Viceroy of Peru. From Peru, he went to Bolivia where he had some success. In 1549, he joined with Pedro de Valdivia coming to Chile from the valley of Potosí, Valdivia gave him an encomienda in the area of the present Valdivia, naming him temporary captain of the new city. The death of Valdivia at the hands of Lautaro made so deep an impression on him that he left his encomienda and served under Francisco de Villagra in the war. Bernal del Mercado showed intelligence, bravery and an energetic character. He also had a deep and lasting hatred towards the Mapuche. 
The defense of the fort of Los Infantes was in his charge and he served under governor Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza and Pedro de Villagra and the government of the Real Audiencia. In 1564, he defeated and killed the toqui Illangulién in the Battle of Angol. He gained a good reputation from his successes in the War of Arauco, and for that reason was appointed Maestro de Campo and in addition corregidor of Concepción in 1565 and of Santiago in 1583. In 1570, he was named to carry out the war as temporary Capitán General after the governor Melchor Bravo de Saravia resigned the post and appointed him in his place. The experience and prestige that he accumulated was immense and had all the merit to be named as Royal Governor of Chile, but his hard and undiplomatic character worked against him. He remained as Maestro de Campo until 1583, and was soon after named Captain of the line of defense. Sometimes he acted as an advisor to the king providing to him with detailed information on the state of the war. He died in Angol in 1593, without becoming Governor.

Knoxville Unitarian Universalist church shooting

On July 27, 2008, a politically motivated fatal shooting took place at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. Motivated by a desire to kill liberals and Democrats, gunman Jim David Adkisson fired a shotgun at members of the congregation during a youth performance of a musical, killing two people and wounding seven others.
Shooting.
The Unitarian Universalist church hosted a youth performance of "Annie Jr." Some 200 people were watching the performance by 25 children when Adkisson (born June 25, 1950) entered the church and opened fire on the audience. Adkisson pulled a Remington Model 48 12-gauge shotgun out of a guitar case and began firing. At first, people thought that the loud bangs of the gunshots were part of the play. One person was killed at the scene: Greg McKendry (60), a longtime church member and usher who deliberately stood in front of the gunman to protect others. Later that night, a 61-year-old woman, Linda Kraeger, died from wounds suffered during the attack. Kraeger was a member of Westside Unitarian Universalist Church in Farragut. Others injured by the shotgun blasts include TVUUC member Tammy Sommers, and visitors John Worth, Joe Barnhart, Jack Barnhart, and Linda Chavez. Allison Lee was injured while escaping with her young children.
The shooter was stopped when church members John Bohstedt, Robert Birdwell, Arthur Bolds, and Terry Uselton and visitor Jamie Parkey restrained him.
The Knoxville Police Department (KPD) responded within three minutes of the 911 call, and ambulance services arrived only minutes later.
Motivations.
Adkisson, a former private in the United States Army from 1974 to 1977, said that he was motivated by hatred of Democrats, liberals, African Americans and homosexuals. According to an affidavit by one of the officers who interviewed Adkisson on July 27, 2008:
During the interview Adkisson stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country, and that he felt that the Democrats had tied his country's hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in America with the aid of major media outlets. Adkisson made statements that because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them into office. Adkisson stated that he had held these beliefs for about the last ten years.
Additionally, one of Adkisson's former wives had been a member (in the 1990s) of the church where the attack occurred.
Adkisson's manifesto also cited the inability to find a job, and that his food stamps were being cut. His manifesto stated that he intended to keep shooting until police arrived and expected to be killed by police. Adkisson had a waist satchel with more ammunition, totaling 76 shells of #4 shot.
In his manifesto, Adkisson also included the Democratic members of the House and Senate, and the "100 People Who Are Screwing Up America" of Bernard Goldberg in his list of wished-for targets.
Response.
Many Unitarian Universalist congregations held special vigils and services in response to the Knoxville shooting. The Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church scheduled a rededication ceremony on August 3, 2008, at which the Rev. Dr. John A. Buehrens, a former president of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) and former pastor of TVUUC spoke. The UUA president, Rev. William G. Sinkford, spoke at a vigil held at Second Presbyterian Church, in Knoxville, on July 28, 2008. A relief fund was created by the UUA and its Thomas Jefferson District to aid those affected by the shooting. On August 10, 2008, the Unitarian Universalist Association took out a full-page ad in the "New York Times". The ad carried the message, "Our Doors "and" Our Hearts Will Remain Open". The Unitarian Universalist Association carried comprehensive coverage of the response of the UU faith community online.
The TVUUC Board voted to rename the 'greeting hall' to honor Greg McKendry, citing his outgoing and friendly personality, and to rename the church library to honor Linda Kraeger, citing her work as an author and professor. An oil painting of Greg McKendry was hung over the fireplace in the greeting hall.
Legal proceedings.
At his first court appearance, Adkisson waived his rights to the preliminary hearing and requested the case go directly to the grand jury. Adkisson was represented by public defender Mark Stephens. Stephens indicated that this move was taken to get the case to trial stage as quickly as possible so resources would become available for a mental health assessment of Adkisson, indicating a possible insanity defense.
According to a knoxnews.com article of August 21, 2008, Adkisson was arraigned that day on charges of murder and attempted murder and a trial date of March 16, 2009 was set. He remained in jail on a $1 million bond. Also according to that article, "authorities haven't said whether Adkisson might face federal charges in the shooting, but the FBI has opened a civil-rights probe."
On February 4, 2009 lawyers representing Adkisson announced that he would plead guilty to two counts of murder, accepting a life sentence without possibility of parole.
On February 9, 2009, Adkisson pleaded guilty to killing two people and wounding six others. "Yes, Ma'am, I am guilty as charged," he told Criminal Court Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz before she sentenced him to life in prison without parole. A mental health expert had determined that Adkisson was competent to make the plea, although public defender Mark Stephens was prepared to argue at the trial that his client was insane at the time the crime was committed.
Victims and church members wept as the prosecutor described the wounds that killed Greg McKendry and Linda Kraeger. The judge gave Adkisson a chance to address members of the congregation before sentencing him. "No, ma'am," he snapped. "I have nothing to say."
John Bohstedt, one of the church members who tackled Adkisson, said he didn't believe that Adkisson was insane, but that he had been manipulated by anti-liberal rhetoric. "Unbalanced, yes. Bitter, yes. Evil, yes. Insane, not in our ordinary use of the word," Bohstedt said.
Assistant District Attorney Leslie Nassios said Adkisson gave a statement to police, which showed that he planned the attack on the church because he believed that Democrats and the church's liberal politics "were responsible for his woes." Evidence showed that Adkisson bought the shotgun a month before the attack, sawed off the barrel at his home and carried the weapon into the church in a guitar case he had purchased two days before the shooting. He had written a suicide note and intended to keep firing until police officers arrived and killed him.
As of 2013 Adkisson, TOMIS ID 00450456, is incarcerated in the Northwest Correctional Complex (NWCX) prison of the Tennessee Department of Corrections. He has been incarcerated since July 27, 2008.

The 244th Aviation Brigade was originally constituted on 16 September 1988 in the Army Reserve as Headquarters, 244th Aviation Group and was activated at Naval Air Station Glenview in Glenview, Illinois. On 31 March 1995 the group's location was changed to Fort Sheridan, Illinois and on 17 October 1995 the Group was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 244th Aviation Brigade. On 1 October 2008, the Brigade headquarters was moved from Fort Sheridan, Illinois to Fort Dix, New Jersey.
The brigade consists of a mix of Active Component and Reserve (Troop Program Unit and Active Guard Reserve) soldiers as well as Department of the Army civilian employees and contractors. Every unit of the brigade has deployed overseas to support contingency operations since 1988, including the Brigade Headquarters and Headquarters Company. These operations include Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Joint Forge, Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Units of the brigade also perform daily missions in cooperation with other United States forces and agencies such as search and rescue operations, assisting in wildfire suppression, providing support at the Army National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, and flying dignitaries around the country.

Tatyana Sukhotina-Tolstaya

Countess Tatyana Lvovna Sukhotina-Tolstaya (or "Tatiana Sukhotin-Tolstoy"; , born "Tatyana Lvovna Tolstaya" (October 4, 1864 – September 21, 1950), was the oldest daughter of the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy.
Tatyana (known in her family as Tanya) grew up close to both her mother and father. She early demonstrated a love of painting, and in 1881 she entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where her teachers were Vasily Perov, Illarion Pryanishnikov, and Leonid Pasternak; she also studied with Nikolai Ge.
Devoted to her father and his ideals, she had rejected a number of suitors, but in 1897 she fell seriously in love with Mikhail Sergeevich Sukhotin, who was in his fifties and married, with six children.Tanya carried on a kind of platonic romance with him, met him secretly, suffered from the falseness of the situation but could not bring herself to break it off. "I am ashamed when I think of Sukhotin's wife and children," she wrote, "although he assured me that I am depriving them of nothing and although I know his wife stopped loving him long ago. And also, "Papa is the great rival of all lovers and none has been able to vanquish him yet. But this love of mine is competing more strongly than any other has done so far."Sukhotin's wife died later that year, and on October 9, Tanya announced her desire to marry Sukhotin to her father, who responded with a fiercely uncompromising rejection ("But why a pure girl should want to get mixed up in such a business is beyond me"). Tanya gave in for the time being, but finally insisted, and on November 14, 1899 the couple were married, with Tolstoy sobbing as he led his daughter to the church. They lived on Sukhotin's estate, Kochety ("The Roosters," in Tula guberniya, about east of Orel), and on November 19, 1905 she gave birth to her only child, a daughter also called Tatyana (Tanya).
From 1914 to 1921 she lived in Yasnaya Polyana, where from 1917 to 1923 she was guardian of the museum; from 1923 to 1925 she was director of the Tolstoy Museum in Moscow. In 1925, together with her daughter, she emigrated to Paris, where she was hostess to Bunin, Chaliapin, Stravinsky, Alexandre Benois, and other members of the Russian exile community. From Paris she moved to Italy, where she spent her final years.
In her diary (Dec. 13, 1932) she wrote: "I have lived an incredibly and undeservedly happy and interesting life. And successful."
Her diary (maintained from October 1878 until 1932) was published in English ("The Tolstoy Home: Diaries of Tatiana Sukhotin-Tolstoy", tr. Alec Brown, London: Harvill Press; New York: Columbia University Press, 1951) and French (Tatiana Tolstoi, "Journal", tr. André Maurois, Paris: Plon, 1953), but in Russian (aside from excerpts in Novy Mir in 1973) not until Т. Л. Сухотина-Толстая, Воспоминания , Moscow: Khudozhestvennaya literatura, 1976.

Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy (film)

Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy () is a Chinese film from 1970, during the height of the Cultural Revolution. The film was directed by Xie Tieli and was based on a contemporary Beijing opera, one of the eight model plays allowed during the Cultural Revolution. The story is based on the novel "Lin hai xue yuan" (林海雪原) and tells the story of an incident in 1946, during the Chinese Civil War. 
"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has been identified as one of the most watched films of all time. Official Chinese government statistics claimed a total audience of 7.3 billion through the end of 1974. The large audience can be attributed to the fact that few films were produced during the Cultural Revolution, and almost all earlier films were banned; nevertheless, the average village held ten film showings per year, and failure to attend could have been seen as a sign of political deviation. Hence, Chinese citizens would have been expected to see the film multiple times during the Cultural Revolution era.

Marcel Wittrisch

Marcel Wittrisch (1 October 1901 – 3 June 1955) was a popular German operatic tenor.
Wittrisch was born in Antwerp, Belgium to a German family, and subsequently studied in Munich, Leipzig, and Milan. His career began in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt in 1925 in a production of "Hans Heiling" by Marschner at the Halle Opera House. He then went to Brunswick and on to Berlin, where he sang opera from 1929 to 1944. Wittrisch also appeared as Eisenstein in "Die Fledermaus" at the Royal Opera House, London in 1931.
The fact that Wittisch was able to carve out a fine career in the face of competition from such renowned German tenor rivals as Richard Tauber, Helge Roswaenge, Franz Völker, Julius Patzak, and Peter Anders, among others, testifies to his talent.
Wittrisch's singing in its prime period during the 1930s was characterised by a fresh, gleaming tone and easy top notes. As his voice matured, he undertook heavier operatic roles such as Wagner's "Lohengrin" in 1937 at the Bayreuth Festival and eventually "Siegmund" and "Parsifal" after the Second World War. He died in Stuttgart, aged 53.
Critical appreciation.
Wittrisch is inevitably compared to his (now) better known contemporary Richard Tauber. According to the English music critic J B Steane: " "Though less individual in style Tauber, he was certainly comparable in timbre and less restricted in the upper register." "
Recordings.
Wittrisch made over 400 individual recordings. Preiser Records released a selection of them entitled "Lebendige Vergangenheit - Marcel Wittrisch" (717281890243) on CD in 1990, followed by "Lebendige Vergangenheit - Marcel Wittrisch Vol 2" (717281895910) in 2004.

Van de Kamp Bakery Building

The Van de Kamp Bakery Building was built in 1930 in the Glassell Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. It served as the headquarters of the chain of bakeries and coffee shops known for their distinctive windmill architecture. The building was designed by New York architect J. Edward Hopkins to resemble a Dutch 16th century farmhouse. Originally there was a Van de Kamp's store next to the building, which was one of the first Van de Kamp's stores ever made and had the famous Van de Kamp's windmill style design. The building remains the only example of an industrial plant in the Dutch Renaissance Revival style. The bakery closed in October 1990 after Van de Kamps filed for Chapter 11. The building is a designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, declared on May 12, 1992.
This building underwent a $72-million renovation by the Los Angeles Community College District with the intent of being a Los Angeles City College satellite campus. The site is instead leased to charter school and job training groups.

Sociology of film

The sociology of film can be clearly seen within the spanning genres of film since the creation of film. The genres span from Gangster films to Musicals that all have sociological aspects embedded in the course of the films. Every screenwriter has always tried to figure out what sociological aspects should be incorporated in a film so that they can reach out to a wide audience within the two hours in which their film is presented.
"One problem, though, is that if the audience is the measure all things, then art becomes a reflection of sociology and dissecting audience tastes becomes the art."
"Somehow, although our poets have not yet defined it for us, a corporation lives a life and finds a fate outside the lives and fates of its human constituents." The sociology of a film is created off of people and their situations that comes to a screen writer who then decides to make the film into a motion picture with the use of those actors and actresses that become the famous socialites of the film.
Since the creation of film, there are six main genres that comprise the film industry. These six genres are: Gangster, Hard Boiled Detective, Western, Screwball Comedy, The Musical and The Family Melodrama. 
Genres.
The western.
The Western tends to be about heroes riding their horses off into the sunset mountains after saving a town from the bad fellas coming from other towns. "The Western hero, in his physical allegiance to the environment and his moral commitment to civilization, embodies this ambiguity." 
The hero of the story is the protector of all men and women in the town, but he is also viewed as the symbol of Westernization within the United States. The town in Westerns also typically stands for the development of the west and the prospective future of striking Gold and other goods the Western World was said to have.
Gangster films.
Gangster films show the side of hidden society that in the early twentieth century was swept under a carpet and not acknowledged.
A lot of gangster films were based on true stories in which describe how the gangster world worked together within the organization and how they bought out quite a few police officers to be on their side in order to keep their profits coming in and their executions unknown or un-investigated. Example: Goodfellas
Later on the National Board of Censorship that was created in 1908 limited what could be shown in gangster films for fear of what people would get ideas for within the present society.
Hard-boiled detective films.
Many popular films that are considered hard-boiled detective films have what is known in the film industry as film noir.
Film noir is a term that was coined by the French who categorized the films of the 1940s-1950s. 
"Generally speaking, film noir ("black films") refers to two interrelated aspects: visually, these films were darker and compositionally more abstract than most Hollywood films; thematically, they were considerably more pessimistic and brutal in their presentation of contemporary American life." 
The sociology of the hard boiled detective films seems to make American life seem violent and secretive.
In one of the most well known hard boiled detective and film noir films, Chinatown, society itself is brought to question with a large water scandal. The film deals with Sociological aspects of the scandal and those involved. The investigation of the detective begins as an investigation that "uncovers secrets under many layers, facades, red herrings, and networks of corruption, conspiracy and deception." 
Within this story of secrets and deception is one women who creates another aspect of the sociology of a film, a woman referred to in the film noir genre as femme fatale, a woman who is a dark, secretive, lead character that traps men and brings them into her web.
Musical films.
Musicals tend to show an inside view of Hollywood and the production of a show making musicals self-reflexive.
As seen in "Singin' in the Rain", Gene Kelly plays a man who works his way up from a musician to the lead in a Hollywood film, thus showing social mobilization within Hollywood during the early stages of films. In "Singing in the Rain", the cast is filming a movie in which is boo-ed before it is even released to the public because the challenge of the films director is to switch the cast from non-verbal communication films to verbal, "talkie" films. 
Musicals are more about the sociology of Hollywood and the happenings behind closed doors. The typical molded Musical also ends with the community coming together along with the musical leads finding love.
After the early 1980s, Musicals seem to disappear. In recent years, Musicals have begun to reappear in theaters and on television.
Screwball comedy films.
Film critics believe that screwball comedies began with the movie "It Happened One Night" where an upper class soon to be bride and a lower class newspaper writer travel together and exchange satirical dialogs. This film lead the way for many other screwball comedies to be written.
In "restructuring the fast-paced upper-crust romance, the screwball comedy dominated Depression-era screen comedy and provided that period's most significant and engaging social commentary." 
The social commentary in many of the screwball comedy films are that there is social mobility within America at the time. In It Happened One Night and Bringing up Baby both females leads are of high social status and fall in love with males of lower social economic status then themselves. Most screwball comedies also contain a lot of sexual innuendos that creates a movie containing quite a bit of talk of sex without actually any sex in the film. In screwball comedies, both male and female leads typically end up happy in their post-depression-era society together.
The family melodrama.
The sociology of film seen in the family melodrama is that of the view of the American Nuclear Family.
"The focus of film melodrama of 1950s Hollywood is the bourgeois family and that it is distinguished by a strong sense of ideological contradiction reflecting wider uncertainties, fears, and neuroses prevalent in postwar Eisenhower America." 
These films use the technique of using music behind a scene, instead of like a musical with people singing to entertain. Using the music behind a scene creates emotion of the song and sets a mood for the scene itself. As reiterated by Thomas Schatz, "the melodrama's narrative formula-- its interrelated family of characters, its repressive small-town milieu, and its preoccupation with America's sociosexual mores-managed to live beyond the Eisenhower years and into the era of civil rights, Vietnam, the sexual revolution, and the Women's Movement."

Local government in New Jersey

Local government in New Jersey is more complex than in most U.S. states, potentially leading to misunderstandings regarding the governmental nature of an area. With five types and twelve forms of local government (plus several non-standard forms in municipalities with special charters), some areas of New Jersey are administered significantly differently from other states. All of New Jersey is included in one of the state's 21 counties and part of the state's 565 municipalities. That means there are no independent cities or consolidated city-counties in New Jersey. There is no unincorporated territory.
County.
New Jersey is divided into 21 counties, and all are governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, which typically serves as both the legislative and executive body. The Boards consist of three, five, seven or nine members; only Warren County, New Jersey has a Board of 3 Freeholders, with voters rejecting expansion to five in November 2007. The means of election of the Freeholders varies from all Freeholders elected in districts, all elected at-large, or mixed district and at-large Freeholders. Elections are first past the post for single-member districts, and for at-large elections when only one seat is at stake. For at-large elections with more than one seat, plurality-at-large voting is used. 
All counties in New Jersey hold organizational meetings on or right after New Year's Day. At this time the Boards elect members to leadership positions on the Boards. Depending upon the specific Board these offices include Director, Deputy Director, President, Vice-President, Chair, Chair Pro Tempore, Vice-Chair. Also at this organizational meeting each Freeholder is assigned as liaison to one or more departments of the county. 
Five counties have a separately elected county executive (Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Mercer). A sixth county (Union) has a county executive that is appointed by the Board, analogous to the council-manager municipal form of government. In these counties, the Board of Chosen Freeholders retain only legislative authority. Most of the rest of the counties also appoint a county supervisor/administrator who is responsible for routine administrative operations of the county government. New Jersey counties have powers that are intermediate between the broad powers of counties in Pennsylvania and the limited powers of counties in New York.
Types.
New Jersey is unique in the United States for having five distinct "types" of incorporated municipalities. Each type of municipality has equal legal standing, rights, and powers as any other type or form. Unlike other parts of the United States, New Jersey does not have different tiers of power or legal standing for its municipal governments. 
Each of the five types has an associated "form" of government of exactly the same title. By default municipalities have the form of government which corresponds to their type, i.e. a Township has the Township form of government. In New Jersey a municipality can choose a different form of government if its citizens do not wish to operate under the form that matches its type.
Borough.
The borough form of government is New Jersey's most common, being used by over 200 of the state's municipalities. Although it was once quite rare, the boroughitis phenomenon of the late 19th century led to the incorporation of large numbers of new boroughs.
Town.
The town form of government dates back to the late 19th century when towns were first incorporated in the state. The town government law was rewritten in 1988. In this form of government, a mayor is elected at-large plus eight councilmen – two from each of four wards. The mayor presides over council meetings and votes as a member of the council. The mayor has veto power over ordinances that can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the council. All appointments to municipal offices are performed by the council. Currently, only nine of the state's 15 towns still have the town form of government, with most of the rest opting to switch to one of the newer optional forms.
Township.
The township form of government has a group of elected officials (the township committee) which serves as both the executive and legislative authority. This form of government is one of the oldest and is derived from the town meeting form of government used in New England, where the township committee has similar functions to the board of selectmen. The township committee has either three or five members elected at-large. Every year, the committee chooses one of their members to be the "mayor", becoming the moderator for meetings of the township committee but having no special powers. In general, all legislative and executive powers are exercised by the committee as a whole. The committee, however, may appoint an administrator to oversee day-to-day operations of the municipality. The township form of government is only available to municipalities that are of the township type. Out of the 246 townships in the state, the township form of government is used by 144 of them.
Village.
The village form of government was made possible by the Village Act of 1891. This form consists of a five-member Board of Trustees elected for staggered three-year terms. The Board selects a President and a Treasurer from among the members. New incorporations under this form were stopped in 1961.
While there are four municipalities that retain the Village type of government (Loch Arbour, Ridgefield Park, Ridgewood and South Orange), none of them still use the Village form of government. Loch Arbour was the last to do so, but on December 20, 2011, its residents voted to change to the Walsh Act form of government, with a three-member board of commissioners.
Form Not Restricted To Type.
In New Jersey municipalities may choose to operate under a different "form" of government. The New Jersey Legislature has provided optional forms of municipal government, but some forms carry restrictions and are not available to all municipalities in New Jersey.
Forms.
New Jersey municipalities are not restricted in their form of government by the type of municipality. Any type of municipality that chooses to do so can adopt one of the six standard optional forms of government listed below, with some exceptions. Municipalities may also adopt non-standard forms of government by having the state legislature enact a special charter.
Charter Study Commission.
A Charter Study Commission is one of two options available to residents of New Jersey to pursue a change in their form of government. The other option is a direct petition. The charter study commission approach is only available under the Faulkner Act.
A charter study commission can be formed by a vote of the governing body. Alternatively, a ballot question to form a charter study commission can be performed through a petition or by the existing municipal governing body enacting an ordinance to form a commission. Voters simultaneously vote yes / no to form a commission and also vote to select its members (if it passes), with the top five candidates becoming the members of the commission.
Walsh Act of 1911.
The Walsh Act was enacted in the Progressive Era as a way to remove corruption and political influence from local politics. Voters elect three or five commissioners in non-partisan elections. Each commissioner is in charge of specific departments within the municipality, and all serve 4-year concurrent terms. Together the commissioners make up the governing body of the municipality.
1923 Municipal Manager Law.
The Municipal Manager Law was enacted in 1923 and is an optional form of government available to any type of municipality. Under this form of government, a municipal council composed of three, five, seven, or nine members is elected at-large with a term of office typically of four years. The council appoints several key officials, namely the municipal manager, tax assessor, auditor, clerk, treasurer, and attorney. The manager is the chief executive of the municipality and is responsible for appointing other officials and preparing the budget for council consideration. The manager serves only at the pleasure of the council. A mayor is also chosen from among the council members whose primary duty is to preside over council meetings. Only seven municipalities currently use this form of government.
Optional Municipal Charter Law.
In 1950 the state legislature passed the Optional Municipal Charter Law, more familiarly known as the Faulkner Act. In the post-World War II era there was a general push toward more efficiency and professionalism in municipal government, as well as the creation of stronger executives at all levels of government. The 1947 New Jersey State Constitution, a contemporary document, reflects these trends as well. Under the Faulkner Act municipalities can choose one of four different options for their form of government. They are:
Faulkner Act (Council-Manager)
Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)
Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council-Administrator)
Faulkner Act (Small Municipality)
Special Charter.
New Jersey municipalities are not required to be governed by the its type, by the Walsh Act, the 1923 Municipal Manager Law or the four forms of the Optional Municipal Charter Law (Faulkner Act). A community that finds all optional forms unsuitable may request a special charter from the state legislature. Such a charter, unique to this municipality, allows its government to be tailor-made to its needs.
Unincorporated communities.
Unincorporated communities in the state of New Jersey are well-defined communities that are part of one or more incorporated municipalities but are not independent municipalities in their own right. 
Some of the communities have official recognition as a Census-designated place, such as Somerset, New Jersey which is part of Franklin Township. Other communities have their own ZIP Code because they have their own post office such as Deans, New Jersey, which is part of South Brunswick Township. Other communities were once single-owner large farms that were later incorporated into a neighboring township such as Middlebush, New Jersey. Some smaller communities are incorporated into larger urban areas, such as when Greenville was merged into Jersey City.
While these unincorporated communities may have a sense of "communal character" and unique identity, they are all located within incorporated municipalities. There is no territory in the state of New Jersey that is not part of an incorporated municipality.

Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha 1

Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha 1, also known as HLA-DPA1, is a human gene.
Function.
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the HLA class II alpha chain paralogues. The class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DPA) and a beta chain (DPB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages).
Gene structure and polymorphisms.
The alpha chain is approximately 33-35 kDa. It is encoded by 5 exons, exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, exon 4 encodes the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic tail. Within the DP molecule both the alpha chain and the beta chain contain the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities, resulting in up to 4 different molecules.

LVG C.II

The LVG C.I was a 1910s German two-seat reconnaissance biplane designed by Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft for the "Luftstreitkräfte".
Development.
The C.II was developed from the LVG B.I, with the pilot and observer positions reversed, adding a ring-mounted machine gun to the rear. The increase in weight required a larger engine, the Benz Bz.III. Few C.I's were built before the C.II was introduced. It incorporated structural improvements and a more powerful engine.
Operational history.
The C.II was the first fixed-wing aircraft to bomb London, when six bombs were dropped near Victoria station on 28 November 1915. (The first air raid on London was by the Zeppelin LZ 38, in the early hours of 1st June 1915.)

Samsung SGH-i900

The Samsung SGH-i900, also known as Omnia I or WiTu (in Russia only), is a mobile phone released by Samsung Mobile. Announced in June 2008, the Omnia was launched in Singapore in mid-June, available in stores on the 20th of June, and in the rest of Asia in July. For some parts of Europe, it was launched in August. The American version launched in December 2008 through Verizon Wireless while the Canadian version launched in April 2009 through Telus Mobility. 
The Samsung Omnia comes with the following applications preinstalled to make its GUI and its functions distinguishable from other Windows Mobile 6–based smartphones:
All these applications have the ability to be controlled by sliding the finger across the screen. The third Today Screen has gained interest because of its control method. It uses about a fourth of the screen on the left side to hold a bar of widgets that can be scrolled up and down. The rest of the screen is customizable, as widgets can be pulled out of the sidebar and onto the main screen to be expanded for quick use.
Camera.
The Samsung Omnia has a 5.0-megapixel camera with autofocus and real Flash. Additionally Samsung Omnia supports VGA resolution video recording with about 20 - 25 frame/s. Samsung Omnia's front-facing 3G camera has a resolution of 0.3 megapixels (VGA).
Korean edition (T*Omnia).
SK Telecom and Samsung announced a Korean edition of Samsung Omnia, T*Omnia or SCH-M490. T is a brand name marketed by SK Telecom. The hardware has been upgraded to have a Wide VGA (800 x 480) LCD screen and a PXA312 CPU that automatically overclocks up to 806 MHz. An S-DMB tuner has replaced the TV-out and FM tuner. The 4 GB version (SCH-M490) is priced at KRW68,000, and the 16 GB (SCH-M495) at KRW1,078,000 including 10% VAT.
Japanese edition (930SC).
In Japan, SoftBank Mobile announced that the Samsung Omnia will be sold as 930SC in November 2008. However, it adopted the proprietary operating system instead of Windows Mobile. It has a Wide VGA LCD and 1seg tuner, but GPS has been excluded. It is also available for SoftBank Mobile's own mobile Internet service.
North American edition (SCH-i910).
The Samsung Omnia has been released under the version name SCH-i910 in North America, with Verizon Wireless as the network operator. The SCH-i910 has a speaker on the back and has CDMA2000 instead of the GSM radio. The SCH-i910 still runs Windows Mobile 6.1 along with some added software such as Visual Voicemail. Most other features stay the same as the SCH-i900. Most noticeably, the i910 does not include the secondary VGA camera on the front; presumably due to the lack of support for video calls in North America. The North American version of the phone uses the same 624 MHz chip used by other versions. This has been confirmed by numerous North American users through the "settings" menu on the Omnia.
Canadian service provider Telus Mobility launched the CDMA2000 Samsung Omnia on April 3, 2009.
Canadian service provider Bell Mobility launched the CDMA2000 Samsung Omnia on April 9, 2009
Omnia II (GT-i8000).
A new model with improved specifications and design called the i8000 Samsung Omnia II.
Samsung Omnia II GT-I8000(H/L/U) is a multimedia smartphone announced at Samsung Unpacked on June 15, 2009. Earlier Omnia II releases runs Windows Mobile 6.1, however it's upgradable to version 6.5. There is also an unofficial and highly experimental Android version available. Verizon is the official US carrier for this phone and released it in December 2009.

Fulgencio R. Moreno

Fulgencio R. Moreno (born November 9, 1872 in Valle del Tapuá, Paraguay) was a Paraguayan journalist, financial expert, statesman and one of the most serious researchers of the Paraguayan history.
Childhood and youth.
Moreno was descendent of the Yegros (by the side of his mother), a family that had significant importance in Paraguayan history.
He went of high school in the Colegio Nacional de la Capital (National School of the Capital) and started to study Law in the Faculty of Law and Social Sciences, from which he, short time after, dropped out of because he consumed his time participating in political activities since 1900. He was an active member of the Colorado Party.
He married Rosario González Filisbert and fathered many children.
Public service.
He was a historical researcher of authority. In 1905, in times of government of the Liberal Party (opposite to the Paraguay), the president Manuel Gondra required his services because of a limit problem with Bolivia. He represented the country in the negotiations with Ricardo Mujía (representative from Bolivia). He was diplomatic representative from Paraguay before the governments of Bolivia, Perú and Chile.
His work.
Carlos Zubizarreta describes him as a meticulous and sparkling writer. With funny and ironic verses, he knew how to find inspiration in the Native-American traditions. He used the satire very creatively: when he was secretary in the Post Office, he used to ask for salary increases in verses with funny twists, something that he repeated sometimes when he was a diplomatic too.
The poet revealed in his poems the influence of the social and physical environment in which he grew up. He identified with the popular culture and learned the secrets of the city, in his writing is present the collective emotion of the people and the image of the Guaraní land.
Given his knowledge in financial matters, for Moreno, the economy was also present in his writing, he wrote many monographs about it, one of them was “La cuestión monetaria en el Paraguay” (The financial matter in Paraguay), published in 1902. In it, he made an analysis of the productive balance and the consequences of the national currency’s devaluation. 
In the same year he published a writing of great diffusion: “Estudio sobre la Independencia del Paraguay” (Study about the Paraguayan Independence) with motive of the centenary of the Paraguayan Independence.
The same year, he published “Extensión territorial del Paraguay al oeste de su río” (The extension of the Paraguayan territory at the west side of the river”.
He was a renowned journalist, permanent writer in “La Prensa” of Buenos Aires.
Historical labor.
Moreno ruled out the supposition of how influential was José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia for the independence of Paraguay. He maintained that: “We can not identify the Paraguayan independence with Francia or attribute him the formation of our nationality because these affirmation, moreover than being contrary to the normal development of countries, are opposite to the documents and historical proves. The way of feeling and thinking of centuries does not change in a day with the effort of just one man”.
Raúl Amaral affirms that Moreno’s historical work would have been of great diversity if he would not have been so focused on the problems in Chaco, which consumes great part of his efforts. His work about the Guaraní migration though, exposed in his investigations about the Chaco is of great value.
In the defense of Paraguayan interests in the conflict with Bolivia he pay special interest in the precise knowledge of the history, his obsessive dedication to this subject gave him the nickname of “Doctor de Límites” (Limits Doctor).
Moreno was awarded with several decorations, Paraguayans and Bolivians. 
Moreno used to describe himself in a funny way: “I am republican, but I was a revolutionary fighter on October 18; I have several decorations without winning any battles, my name is Moreno (that means a person with dark skin) but I am white, I am sorry my friends, but I am no doctor.
Last years.
He died in Asunción at the age of 61, in 1933.

USS Nutmeg (AN-33)

USS "Nutmeg" (AN-33/YN-33) was an "Aloe"-class net laying ship which was assigned to serve the U.S. Navy during World War II with her protective anti-submarine nets.
Built in Cleveland, Ohio.
"Nutmeg" (YN–28), formerly "Sycamore", was laid down 18 October 1940 by American Shipbuilding Company, Cleveland, Ohio; launched 13 March 1941; placed in service 30 October. Allocated to the 1st Naval District for net tending duty in the Boston Harbor area she was reclassified "AN–33" on 20 June 1944.
World War II service.
Through the spring of 1945 "Nutmeg" was engaged in maintaining and repairing net defenses in Boston Harbor. In May she was attached to Commander Task Force 24 for the purpose of maintaining the anti-torpedo net in Placentia Harbor, Argentia, Newfoundland. She departed Argentia 19 June with Gate Craft (Non-self propelled) "YNG–27" in tow, arriving 23 June at South Boston Navy Yard for overhaul and repairs.
"Nutmeg" had been scheduled for duty at Pearl Harbor when she departed Boston, Massachusetts, 21 July for transit to the U.S. West Coast via Key West, Florida, the Panama Canal Zone, and San Pedro, California. 
Voyage repairs and a main engine casualty necessitated a change in schedule, and when World War II ended, "Nutmeg" was placed on the inactive list and shifted to the Columbia River Reserve Basin. 
Post-war decommissioning.
Placed out of commission, in reserve in January 1947, she was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet in 1959 and was struck from the Navy List 1 September 1962. She remained in reserve until she was sold 8 July 1971.

History of the Detroit Red Wings

The history of the Detroit Red Wings begins with the Detroit Red Wings joining the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1926. With the demise of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), the rights to the players of the Victoria Cougars, were purchased by a Detroit group. The new NHL franchise began play as the Detroit Cougars. In 1930, the Cougars changed their name to the Detroit Falcons, and would settle as the Detroit Red Wings in 1933.
Since joining the league in 1926, the Red Wings have won the Stanley Cup eleven times, their most recent title being in 2008. Thirty-four Red Wings players and four builders have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Founding.
At the April 18, 1926 NHL meetings to discuss expansion of the NHL, five applications were received from Detroit along with three from Chicago, one from Cleveland, one from New Jersey, one from Hamilton and one from New York. The New York application, to become the New York Rangers was approved. The NHL decided to investigate all applicants before deciding at their next meeting. At the time, it was known that the Western Canada Hockey League was folding. Other than the Rangers, there was opposition to adding any other teams to the NHL. The NHL constitution required unanimous approval on adding new teams and the New York Americans were opposed to the plan to add one team in Detroit and one in Chicago, as the Americans favoured two teams in Chicago. This was overcome at the May 2, 1926 NHL meeting by amending the NHL constitution, which required only a 2/3 approval, to allow a simple majority vote for the approval of new teams and it became expected that Chicago and Detroit would receive franchises. At the meeting, what were now two competing syndicates vying for the Detroit franchise, one from Townsend and McCreath, and one from Bierer, were ordered to amalgamate by the NHL.
The next day, May 3, it was announced by Detroit promoters Morris Caplan and Morris Friedberg that they had purchased the 1925 Stanley Cup champion Victoria Cougars in expectation of a NHL franchise being awarded to them at NHL meetings later that month. Similarly, the Portland Rosebuds were also purchased that day by Chicago interests. On May 15, 1926, Detroit was tentatively awarded a NHL expansion team to a group of investors led by Townsend, Seyburn and McCreath, not Caplan and Friedberg, on condition of the arena being ready for the upcoming season. At the time, the arena was expected to be ready for December 1. The Victoria Club was sold by Lester and Frank Patrick to the Townsend group for $100,000, of which $25,000 went to Caplan and Friedberg. Although the arena was not ready, the franchise was permanently approved by the NHL on September 25, 1926. The franchise was established as the Detroit Cougars, retaining the Victoria name. However, the NHL does not consider the Red Wings to be a continuation of the Victoria team.
Early seasons.
1926-1932: Cougars and Falcons.
Without a Detroit arena, the new Cougars played their first season in Windsor, Ontario at the Border Cities Arena. Frank Patrick of Victoria did not come east to manage Detroit. The Cougars signed former Calgary Tigers player Art Duncan to play and coach the team, but the NHL, in its distribution of WHL players ordered Detroit to send players Art Gagne and Fraser to the Chicago Black Hawks for Duncan. The Cougars finished their first season with a record of 12 wins, 28 losses and 4 ties for 28 points, the worst record in the American division and NHL.
The next year, the 1927–28 season, the team moved into the Detroit Olympia, playing their first game on November 22, 1927. This building would be the home arena for the team until 1979. Also in that year, Duncan was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was replaced as coach and general manager by Jack Adams, recently retired from the Ottawa Senators. Adams would be the face of the franchise for the next 36 years as coach or general manager. The Cougars finished with a record of 19-19-6, moving up to fourth place in the American division.
The Cougars made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 1929 with Carson Cooper leading the team in scoring. The Cougars were outscored 7–2 in the two-game series with Toronto.
In 1930 the team changed its name to the Detroit Falcons as a result of a promotion with a newspaper. They would reach the NHL playoffs for the first time in 1929, losing the series to the Toronto Maple Leafs. However, the team continued to have financial difficulties, and was forced into receivership in 1931.
1932-1942: The new Detroit Red Wings.
Chicago grain merchant James E. Norris bought the team in 1932. His first act was to change the team's name to the Red Wings. Norris believed the new name would help the team curry favor with Detroit's auto industry, and also wanted to pay homage to a hockey team for whom he had played earlier in the century, the Montreal Hockey Club—nicknamed the Winged Wheelers. He also designed the first logo for the Red Wings, which is more or less the same logo that is used today.
Under the new name Red Wings, the team began to improve. Carl Voss was named the inaugural recipient of the Calder Trophy as rookie-of-the-year in 1932–33. The team as a whole also began to enjoy success. They reached the 1934 Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the Chicago Black Hawks.
In 1935–36 the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup for the first time, defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs. En route to the final, they played in the longest overtime game in NHL history, winning the first game of a semi-final match against the Montreal Maroons in the sixth overtime frame. The match lasted 176 minutes and 30 seconds of game time, ending when rookie Mud Bruneteau scored, giving Detroit a 1-0 win.
In 1938, the Wings and the Montreal Canadiens became the first NHL teams to play in Europe, visiting Paris and London. The Wings played nine games against the Canadiens and went 3-5-1. The Wings did not play in Europe again until the preseason and start of the 2009-10 NHL season in Sweden against the St. Louis Blues.
Original Six era.
1940s.
They made the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive years during the early 1940s. In 1941 they were swept by the Boston Bruins, in 1942 they lost a seven-game series against Toronto in the finals after winning the first three games, but in 1943, with Syd Howe and Mud Bruneteau scoring 20 goals apiece, Detroit won their third Cup by sweeping the Bruins. They remained a solid team through the rest of the decade, making the playoffs every year, and reaching the finals three more times.
In 1946, one of the greatest players in hockey history came into the NHL with the Red Wings. Gordie Howe, a right-winger from Floral, Saskatchewan, only scored seven goals and 15 assists in his first season and would not reach his prime for a few more years. It was also the last season as head coach for Adams, who stepped down after the season to concentrate on his duties as general manager. He was succeeded by minor league coach Tommy Ivan.
By his second season, Howe was paired with Sid Abel and Ted Lindsay to form what would become one of the great lines in NHL history—the "Production Line". Lindsay's 33 goals propelled the Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were swept by the Maple Leafs. Detroit reached the Finals again the following season, only to be swept again by Toronto.
1950–66: The Gordie Howe Era.
The Wings returned to the top in 1950, with Pete Babando scoring the game winner in double overtime of Game 7 to beat the Rangers in the Finals. After the game, Lindsay skated around the Olympia ice with the Cup, beginning a tradition that continues today.
After being upset by Montreal in the 1951 semifinals, Detroit won its fifth Cup in 1952, sweeping both the Leafs and the Canadiens, with the Production Line of Howe, Abel and Lindsay joined by second-year goalie Terry Sawchuk. Detroit would become the first team in 17 years to go undefeated in the playoffs. They also scored an amazing 24 playoff goals, compared to Toronto and Montreal's combined total of 5. Abel left the Wings for Chicago following the season, and Alex Delvecchio took his spot on the roster.
James E. Norris died in December 1952. He was succeeded as team president by his daughter, Marguerite – the first (and as of the 2006–07 season, only) woman to head an NHL franchise. She made no secret of her dislike for Adams. While she could have summarily fired him, since he was still without a contract, she chose not to do so.
Following another playoff upset in 1953 at the hands of the Bruins, the Red Wings won back to back Stanley Cups in 1954 (over Montreal, when Habs defenseman Doug Harvey redirected a Tony Leswick shot into his own net) and 1955 (also over Montreal in the full seven games). The 1954–55 season ended a run of eight straight regular season titles, an NHL record.
Also during the 1955 off-season, Marguerite Norris lost an intrafamily power struggle, and was forced to turn the Wings over to younger brother Bruce, who had inherited his father's grain business. Detroit and Montreal met once again in the 1956 finals, but this time the Canadiens won the Cup, their first of five in a row.
In 1957 Ted Lindsay, who scored 30 goals and led the league in assists with 55, teamed up with Harvey to help start the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA). As a result he, along with outspoken young netminder Glenn Hall, was promptly traded to Chicago (which was owned by James D. Norris, Bruce's elder brother) after his most productive year. The Wings had lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Bruins.
The Lindsay deal was one of several questionable trades made by Adams in the late 1950s. For example, in 1955, he had traded Sawchuk to Boston; while he managed to get Sawchuk back two years later, he had to trade up-and-coming Johnny Bucyk to do it. It was one of the most one-sided trades in hockey history – while Sawchuk's best days had passed, Bucyk went on to play 21 more years with the Bruins and score over 500 goals en route to the Hall of Fame. In 1958 the Red Wings were swept in the first round by Montreal; in 1959 they missed the playoffs for the first time in 21 years.
Within a couple of years, however, Detroit was rejuvenated and made the Finals for four of the next six years between 1961 and 1966. Still, despite having Howe, Delvecchio, Norm Ullman, and Parker MacDonald as consistent goal-scorers, Lindsay's sudden one-year comeback in 1964–65, and Sawchuk and later Roger Crozier between the pipes, the Wings came away empty-handed. Adams was fired as general manager in 1963. He had coached for 15 years and served as general manager for 31 years on a handshake, and his 36–year tenure is still the longest for any general manager in NHL history.
1967 Expansion to 1993.
1967–82: The "Dead Wings" Era.
Only a year after making the Finals, the Red Wings finished a distant fifth, 24 points out of the playoffs. It was the beginning of a slump from which they would not emerge for almost 20 years. Between 1967 and 1983, Detroit only made the playoffs twice, winning one series. From 1968 to 1982, the Wings had 14 head coaches (not counting interim coaches), with none lasting more than three seasons. In contrast, their first six full-time coaches – Art Duncan, Adams, Ivan, Jimmy Skinner, and Abel – had covered a 42–year period. During this dark era in franchise history, the team was derisively known as the "Dead Wings" or "Dead Things".
One factor was the end of the old "development" system, which allowed Adams to get young prospects to commit to playing for Detroit as early as their 16th birthday. Another factor was Ned Harkness, who was hired as coach in 1970 and was promoted to general manager midway through the season. A successful college hockey coach, Harkness tried to force his two-way style of play on a veteran Red Wings team resistant to change. The Wings chafed under his discipline, in which he demanded short hair and no smoking, along with new rules regarding drinking and phone calls. Harkness was forced to resign in 1973.
In the "expansion season" of 1967–68, the Red Wings also acquired longtime star left-winger Frank Mahovlich from the defending Cup champs in Toronto. Mahovlich would go on a line with Howe and Delvecchio, and in 1968–69, he scored a career-high 49 goals and had two All-Star seasons in Detroit.
However, this could not last. Mahovlich was traded to Montreal in 1970, and Howe retired after the 1970–71 season. Howe returned to pro hockey shortly after to play with his two sons Mark and Marty Howe (Mark would later join the Red Wings at the end of his career) in the upstart World Hockey Association (WHA) in 1972. Through the decade, with Mickey Redmond having two 50–goal seasons and Marcel Dionne starting to reach his prime (which he did not attain until he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings), a lack of defensive and goaltending ability continually hampered the Wings.
Around the same time, the area around the Olympia went to seed. After two murders took place near the arena, Norris seriously considered moving to an arena in suburban Pontiac. However, the city offered the Red Wings a deal Norris couldn't refuse—operational control of a new city-owned arena on the banks of the Detroit River, Joe Louis Arena. The Red Wings moved to the new arena during the 1979–80 season.
. In 1982, after 50 years of family ownership, Bruce Norris sold the Red Wings to Mike Ilitch, founder of Little Caesars Pizza.
1983–1993: The Yzerman Era Begins.
In 1983 the Wings drafted Steve Yzerman, a center from Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada. He led the team in scoring in his rookie year, and started the Wings' climb back to the top. That season, with John Ogrodnick scoring 42 times and Ivan Boldirev and Ron Duguay also with 30–goal seasons, Detroit made the playoffs for the first time in six years. Defenseman Brad Park, acquired from the Boston Bruins in the 1983 free-agent market, also helped the Wings reach the postseason and ended up winning the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy the same season.
Later Park was asked to coach the Wings, but was sacked after 45 games in 1985–86. He admitted, “I took over a last-place team, and I kept them there.” They did indeed end up in the basement with a 17–57–6 record for only 40 points. This was the same year that the Wings added enforcer Bob Probert, one of the most familiar faces of the Wings in the 1980s and 1990s.
By 1987, with Yzerman joined by Petr Klima, Adam Oates, Gerard Gallant, defenceman Darren Veitch and new head coach Jacques Demers, the Wings won a playoff series for only the second time in the modern era. They made it all the way to the conference finals against the powerful and eventual Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers, but lost in five games. In 1988 they won their first division title in 23 years (since 1964–65, when they finished first in a one-division league). They did so, however, in a relatively weak division; no other team in the Norris finished above .500. As was the case in the previous season, they made it to the conference finals only to lose again to the eventual cup champion Oilers in five games.
In 1989, Yzerman scored a career-best 65 goals, but Detroit was upset in the first round by the Chicago Blackhawks. The following season Yzerman scored 62 goals, but the team missed the playoffs. Rumors spread that maybe "Stevie Wonder" should be traded.
But it was Demers, not Yzerman, who got the pink slip. New coach Bryan Murray was unable to get them back over .500, but they returned to the playoffs. Yzerman was joined by Sergei Fedorov, who would be an award-winner and frequent all-star for the team in the 1990s. In 1992, the team acquired Ray Sheppard, who had a career-best 52 goals two years later; and in '93, top defenseman Paul Coffey. Also joining the Red Wings around this time were draft picks like Slava Kozlov, Darren McCarty, Vladimir Konstantinov, and Nicklas Lidstrom.
1994 to present.

The Yzerman trade rumors ended very soon after Scotty Bowman got behind the Motown bench in 1993. In his second season, the lockout-shortened 1994–95 NHL season, he guided Detroit to its first Finals appearance in 29 years, only to be swept by the New Jersey Devils.
The Wings kept adding more star power, picking up Slava Fetisov, Igor Larionov, and goaltender Mike Vernon in trades and winning an NHL record 62 games in 1996. After defeating the St. Louis Blues (with a Game 7, double-overtime goal by Yzerman), the Wings would fall in the Western Conference Finals to the eventual champion Colorado Avalanche (formerly Quebec Nordiques).
The following year, Detroit, joined by Brendan Shanahan and Larry Murphy during the season, once again reached the Finals in 1997. After defeating the St. Louis Blues in six games, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Colorado Avalanche in the first three rounds, the Wings went on to beat the Philadelphia Flyers in four straight games in the Stanley Cup Finals. It was the Wings' first Stanley Cup since 1955, breaking the longest drought (42 years long) in the league at that time. Mike Vernon accepted the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the 1997 playoffs.
Tragedy struck the Wings six days after their championship; defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, one of the "Russian Five", suffered a brain injury in a limousine accident, and his career came to an abrupt end. Wings trainer Sergei Mnatsakanov suffered similar injuries. Red Wings defenseman Slava Fetisov was also injured in the accident, but was released from the hospital the next day. The Red Wings dedicated the 1997–98 season, which also ended in a Stanley Cup victory (another sweep, this time over the Washington Capitals), to Konstantinov, who came out onto the ice in his wheelchair on victory night to touch the Cup. Yzerman, who had won the Conn Smythe Trophy as postseason Most Valuable Player that year, immediately gave the Cup to Konstantinov after he hoisted it. He later reported that he had intended to pass it to goalie Chris Osgood for his stellar surprise performance. "Not very often does a moment in hockey transcend sports," remarked Brendan Shanahan later.
The following season, the Wings looked poised to "three-peat" for the first time in franchise history, acquiring three-time top blueliner Chris Chelios from his hometown Chicago Blackhawks in March 1999, but it was not to be as they would end up losing the Western Conference Semifinals to Colorado in six games.
The Wings had built up a fierce rivalry with the Avalanche in this time. With the Red Wings beating the Avs in the third round in 1997, and Colorado beating Detroit in the second round in both 1999 and 2000, the battles between these two teams had become one of the fiercest in sports. During a game on March 26, 1997, a brawl ensued between Colorado goalie Patrick Roy and his Detroit counterpart Mike Vernon. In a separate fight, Darren McCarty paid back Avalanche player Claude Lemieux for his hit from behind on Kris Draper the year before. Fittingly, it was Darren McCarty who scored the overtime goal to give the Red Wings the 6–5 victory in the game that became known as "Fight Night at the Joe."
In 2001, Detroit, the league's second-best team in the regular season, were upset in the playoffs by the Los Angeles Kings. During the summer that followed, they acquired legendary goalie Dominik Hasek (the defending Vezina Trophy winner) in a trade with the Buffalo Sabres. They also landed left-wing Luc Robitaille and right-wing Brett Hull through free agency. Rookie center Pavel Datsyuk joined the Wings from the Russian Super League the same year. The Wings became the hands-down favorite to win the Cup in 2002. They did not disappoint, posting the league's best record in the regular season and defeating Colorado in seven games in the Western Conference Finals after beating the Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues in rounds one and two. The Red Wings went on to capture another Cup in five games over the Cinderella-story Carolina Hurricanes, with Nicklas Lidstrom winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff's Most Valuable Player. Bowman and Hasek both elected to retire after the season. Yzerman, Hull, and Robitaille were inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009.
The 2003 season saw the Red Wings promote associate coach Dave Lewis to the head coach position after Bowman's retirement. Needing a new starting goaltender after Hasek's retirement, the Red wings signed Curtis Joseph from the Toronto Maple Leafs to a three year, $24 million deal. Also new to the lineup was highly touted Swedish prospect Henrik Zetterberg. The Red Wings finished the season second in the Western Conference and third overall in the NHL. The Red Wings were favored in their first round matchup against the 7th seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. But the Ducks shocked the hockey world by sweeping the Red Wings in four games, thanks in large part to the strong performance of Ducks goaltender J. S. Giguere. The Ducks later advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost in Game 7 to the New Jersey Devils.
Longtime Wing Sergei Fedorov signed with the Mighty Ducks as a free agent during the offseason, after a long contract dispute. More importantly, Dominik Hasek decided to come out of retirement, and joined the Wings for the 2003–04 season. The Wings also added defenseman Derian Hatcher from the Dallas Stars via free agency, as well as forward Ray Whitney from the Columbus Blue Jackets. Joseph, despite being one of the highest-paid players in the NHL, had to spend part of the season with the Grand Rapids Griffins, Detroit's American Hockey League affiliate. The Wings attempted to trade him; but, perhaps because of his large contract, there were no suitors. Ultimately, Hasek called it quits after just 14 games because of a groin injury, and Joseph became the Wings' No. 1 goalie again, and helped lead the team to the top of the Central Division and the National Hockey League standings. Hatcher was also injured just a few games into the regular season with a torn MCL. Hatcher would not return until the end of the regular season. The Wings acquired veteran center Robert Lang from the Capitals at the trade deadline.
The Red Wings eliminated the Nashville Predators in six games in the first round of the playoffs, which led to a second round matchup with the Calgary Flames. In Game 5, with the series tied at two games apiece, a deflected puck struck Steve Yzerman in the left eye, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. The Red Wings lost that game 1–0, and were eliminated the next game in Calgary by the same score in overtime. While the Red Wings have remained one of the NHL's strongest franchises with regard to finances, it was estimated that they could only be profitable if they advanced to the Conference Finals in the playoffs.
During the 2004 offseason, the Wings focused on keeping players they already had instead of being active on the free agent market. They re-signed Frank J. Selke Trophy-winning forward Kris Draper, who had just had a career season, to a four-year deal, and captain Yzerman to a one-year deal. They also re-signed Brendan Shanahan, Jiri Fischer, Jason Williams, and Mathieu Dandenault as well head coach Dave Lewis. Deals were not reached with veteran defensemen Chris Chelios and Mathieu Schneider or star forward Pavel Datsyuk before the NHL owners triggered their lockout on September 15. There also was a parting of ways with veteran forward Brett Hull, who signed with the Phoenix Coyotes as did forward Boyd Devereaux.
2005 and beyond: New era for Detroit.
On July 15, 2005, Mike Babcock, former head coach in Anaheim, became the new head coach for the Wings.
On August 8, the Wings brought back goaltender Chris Osgood, who had spent time with the New York Islanders and St. Louis Blues since his last stint in Detroit, by signing him to a one-year contract.
Approximately fourteen minutes into a game on November 21, 2005 against the Nashville Predators, defenseman Jiri Fischer suffered a seizure and collapsed on the bench. His heart had stopped, and he was resuscitated by CPR and an AED. The game was canceled because of his injury, and was made up on January 23, 2006. This was the first time in NHL history a game had been postponed by injury. The game was played for the full 60 minutes; however, the Predators were allowed to maintain their 1–0 lead from the original game and won, 3–2.
For the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, the NHL again agreed to allow players to participate for their home countries. The Red Wings sent 10 players to the competition. Gold medal winners from Team Sweden included Lidstrom, Henrik Zetterberg, Mikael Samuelsson, Tomas Holmstrom, and Niklas Kronwall. Robert Lang represented the Bronze medal winning Team Czech Republic.
The Red Wings won the Presidents' Trophy with a 58–16–8 record, earning them 124 points.(NHL Standings), and secured home ice advantage for the entire playoffs.
The Detroit Red Wings opened the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Edmonton Oilers with a 3–2 overtime victory at Joe Louis Arena. However, the Oilers won 4 of the next 5 games to take the series.
After the playoffs, Detroit management informed goaltender Manny Legace that he would not be a part of the team next season, while Chris Osgood and Nicklas Lidstrom signed 2–year extensions.
Continuing the shakeup of the Red Wings roster, July 9 brought the signing of alternate captain Brendan Shanahan to a free agent deal with the New York Rangers after spending the previous 9 seasons with the club. Shanahan turned down equal offers from the Wings and Montreal Canadiens to sign with the Rangers, stating that he felt he was part of the Red Wings past, not future. July 31 brought the re-signing of Dominik Hasek to a one-year deal from the Ottawa Senators, marking the beginning of his third stint with the Wings. 
Perhaps the biggest change to the roster in the off season was the announcement that Steve Yzerman would retire from playing hockey after playing 23 seasons with the Wings. He subsequently was offered the job of Vice President of Operations, and remained with the team. Not long after, it was announced that Yzerman's number 19 would be retired during the following season. Yzerman retired with the distinction of having been the longest serving team captain in NHL history.
The Red Wings opened the 2006–07 season with Steve Yzerman "passing the torch" to Nicklas Lidstrom when Lidstrom was named Captain for the 2006–07 season. The Red Wings retired Steve Yzerman's jersey number 19 on January 2 before a game with the Anaheim Ducks.
The Red Wings hold the longest current playoff streak of all professional North American sports teams, at 22 consecutive seasons.
At the 2007 NHL trade deadline, the Wings acquired forwards Kyle Calder and the injured Todd Bertuzzi. Calder came to Detroit in return for Jason Williams. Bertuzzi was acquired from the Florida Panthers for conditional draft picks and prospect Shawn Matthias. That April, the Wings signed Pavel Datsyuk to a seven-year contract extension, along with re-signing gritty forward Kirk Maltby to a three-year deal. The Wings finished first in the Western Conference and tied for first in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres, but the Sabres were awarded the Presidents' Trophy by virtue of having the greater number of wins.
Game 1 of the opening round saw the Red Wings' 452–game home sellout streak (dating back to December 10, 1996) come to end with an announced crowd of 19,204. They advanced to the third round of the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs after defeating the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks both in six games, coming back three straight after the Sharks' 2–1 series lead. The Red Wings lost to the eventual Stanley Cup winning team - the Anaheim Ducks, in the Western Conference Finals four games to two. In doing so, the 2007 Playoffs marked the most successful run for Detroit since their 2002 Stanley Cup Championship, finishing two games away from a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals.
On July 1, free agent defenseman Mathieu Schneider signed a deal with the Ducks. However, Detroit filled the void by immediately signing former New Jersey Devil and Dearborn, Michigan native Brian Rafalski to a 5–year deal. A short time later, Todd Bertuzzi followed in Schneider's footsteps to a free agent deal with Anaheim. Kyle Calder signed a free agent deal with the Los Angeles Kings and Robert Lang signed with the Chicago Blackhawks. The Red Wings then signed former St. Louis Blues captain Dallas Drake to a 1 year deal. Drake was originally drafted by Detroit in 1989 and played for them from 1992–1994 before being traded to Winnipeg.
To start the 2007–2008 campaign, Henrik Zetterberg recorded at least a point in each of Detroit's first 16 games, setting a club record. At the 2008 trade deadline, the Red Wings announced that they had signed former Wing Darren McCarty to a one-year contract for the remainder of the season. The Red Wings also acquired defenseman Brad Stuart from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for a second-round pick in 2008 and a fourth-round pick in 2009. Nearing the end of the 2007–2008 season, Detroit signed Michigan State University senior Justin Abdelkader to a three-year contract.
The Red Wings won their eleventh Stanley Cup on June 4, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Penguins in Game Six of the Stanley Cup Finals by a score of 3-2. This was their fourth Stanley Cup in 11 years. Henrik Zetterberg scored the Stanley Cup winning goal and was also named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. Nicklas Lidstrom became the first European Captain to win the Stanley Cup.
On July 2, 2008, the Detroit Red Wings announced the signing on unrestricted free agent Marian Hossa to a one-year deal worth approximately $7.4 million. Hossa was a member of the Pittsburgh Penguins team that the Red Wings defeated in the 2008 Stanley Cup Final. Hossa reportedly turned down several other longer termed and higher paid offers from other teams to join the Red Wings, stating that he felt Detroit gave him his best opportunity to win a Stanley Cup. The Red Wings also re-signed free agents Brad Stuart and Valtteri Filppula to four- and five-year deals, respectively. The Red Wings also signed goaltender Ty Conklin to a one-year deal upon the retirement of Dominik Hasek; Conklin was also a member of the Penguins the previous season along with Hossa. Winger Dallas Drake announced his retirement in July, and in early August it was announced that former coach Scotty Bowman had taken a senior advisor position with the Chicago Blackhawks, citing the opportunity to work with his son (Chicago assistant GM Stan Bowman) was too good to pass up.
From the beginning of the 2008–09 season to New Year's Day, the Wings enjoyed success, although second to the San Jose Sharks. On January 1, 2009, the Red Wings played the Chicago Blackhawks in the third NHL Winter Classic at Chicago's Wrigley Field, beating them 6-4. Ty Conklin was the starting goaltender for the Red Wings; he also started in net for the 2003 and 2008 Winter Classic. In those games, he played for the Edmonton Oilers and Pittsburgh Penguins, respectively.
It was announced in February 2009 that the Red Wings would start the 2009–10 season in Stockholm, Sweden against the St. Louis Blues inside the Globe Arena. At the time of the announcement, 8 of Detroit's players were from Sweden: Jonathan Ericsson, Johan Franzen, Tomas Holmstrom, Niklas Kronwall, Mikael Samuelsson, Andreas Lilja, Henrik Zetterberg and team captain Nicklas Lidstrom.
On March 15, 2009, the Red Wings defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets to became the first team in NHL history to top 100 points in nine straight seasons, breaking a tie with the Montreal Canadiens (1974–75 through 1981–82).
The Red Wings entered the 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs as the second overall seed in the Western Conference, second only to the San Jose Sharks, as well as heavy favorites to win the Stanley Cup for a second consecutive year. They were matched up with the Columbus Blue Jackets, appearing in their first ever postseason. The Red Wings handily won the first three games of the series and, in a back and forth Game 4, swept Columbus out of the playoffs with a 6-5 win. With the series win, the Red Wings become the first defending Stanley Cup champions to advance to the 2nd round of the playoffs since the Colorado Avalanche in 2002.
The Red Wings next matchup were the 8th seeded Anaheim Ducks, who had upset the first seeded San Jose Sharks in six games. The teams split the first two games in Detroit before Anaheim took a 2-1 series lead in Game 3, which featured a controversial non-call on a would-be tying Detroit goal by Marian Hossa with under a minute remaining in regulation. Detroit would bounce back to tie the series with a Game 4 win, and then took a 3-2 series lead in Detroit after a win in Game 5. Anaheim was able to avoid elimination with a victory in Game 6, which set up the deciding Game 7 in Detroit. With the teams tied 3-3, Detroit's Daniel Cleary scored the winning goal with three minutes remaining to eliminate Anaheim and send Detroit to the Western Conference Finals against their fellow Original 6 rivals, the Chicago Blackhawks. Through the first four games of the series, Detroit achieved a 3-1 lead setting up the potential game-deciding Game 5 in Detroit, where the Red Wings advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals with a 2-1 overtime victory, the winner being scored by Darren Helm.
The Red Wings would face the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Finals for a second consecutive year, but this series would feature a different outcome. Detroit missed a chance to win the Stanley Cup on Pittsburgh ice in Game 6, setting up a Game 7 showdown at Joe Louis Arena. Pittsburgh defeated the Red Wings by a score of 2-1, becoming only the 2nd NHL team to lose The Cup at home in Game 7.
During the 2009 offseason, the Red Wings were unable due to league salary cap restrictions to re-sign forward Marian Hossa who signed 12 year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. The Red Wings decided to give Jimmy Howard a chance as NHL goaltender so they did not resign Ty Conklin who departed to the St. Louis Blues. The Wings would sign Patrick Eaves and three former Red Wings Andy Delmore, Jason Williams and Todd Bertuzzi to deals as well as resigning Ville Leino.
The Red Wings began the 2009-10 NHL Season in Stockholm, Sweden, falling in both games to the St. Louis Blues by scores of 4-3 and 5-3, respectively.
During the first month of the season, the Red Wings would lose three of their top players to injury as ? would have a knee injury in their home opener at Joe Louis Arena, Valtteri Filppula with a broken wrist at Rexall Place in Edmonton and Jason Williams to a broken leg in Toronto. However aside from all the injuries the Red Wings have maintained a winning record, they also claimed Drew Miller off of waivers in November 2009. Against the Canadiens on November 21, the injury-riddled Wings would lose 2nd line defenseman Nicklas Kronwall to a sprained MCL as a result of a knee-on-knee hit by Montreal enforcer Georges Laraque. This resulted in a five game suspension for Laraque

Nonja (Miami)

Nonja (1952 - December 29, 2007) was a female sumatran orangutan who was thought to be the oldest of her species in either the wild or captivity. She was 55 years old when she died in 2007.
Nonja, whose name meant "girl" in Malaysian, was captured in the wild and brought to the Wassenaar Zoo in the Netherlands in 1955. She was thought to be about 2-3 years old at the time. She was transferred to the Miami MetroZoo (now Zoo Miami) on October 4, 1983, where she spent the rest of her life. Nonja gave birth to five offspring.
Nonja died at the Miami MetroZoo on Saturday, December 29, 2007. Experts believe that she died of either a brain tumor or an aneurysm. She was 55 years old when she died. Most orangutans die before they reach their mid-40s, which made Nonja unique and likely the oldest living orangutan in the world at the time.

Paul Lester Wiener

Paul Lester Wiener (1895–1967) was an American architect and urban planner. 
Education.
He was educated in the Royal Academy of Berlin with post graduate study in Vienna and Paris. He came to the United States in 1913 and became a citizen in 1919. He returned to Europe for further study and work until 1927. In 1934, he designed the Contempora House and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.
Notable projects.
Paul Lester Wiener collaborated with Le Corbusier. Wiener and Sert originated a master plan for the city of Bogota and several other city units in Colombia which were based on the principles of planning for expected population and organizing the growth of the city in and efficient manner, as well as reorganizing existing features to provide planned living and recreational space for residents with an eye to preventing the undesirable effects of random growth such as slum housing and inequitable distribution of land, etc.
In 1958, Wiener accepted his most significant commission in the United States: to plan a neighborhood development in the Washington Square area of New York City, providing several thousand housing units within a six block area. Combining his concepts of clean basic lines a functional form with bold color, he designed a series of high rise apartments which incorporated outdoor patio style living with the convenience of a central urban location and exciting visual environment.

<doc id="18611260" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18611260" title="Hermaphrodite">
Hermaphrodite

In biology, a hermaphrodite is an organism that has reproductive organs normally associated with both male and female sexes.
Many taxonomic groups of animals (mostly invertebrates) do not have separate sexes. In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which both partners can act as the "female" or "male". For example, the great majority of pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.
Historically, the term "hermaphrodite" has also been used to describe ambiguous genitalia and gonadal mosaicism in individuals of gonochoristic species, especially human beings. The word "intersex" has come into preferred usage for humans, since the word "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading and stigmatizing, as well as "scientifically specious and clinically problematic".
Etymology.
The term derives from the , from , which derives from Hermaphroditos, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology. According to Ovid, he fused with a nymph, Salmacis, resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes. Although according to Diodorus, who mentions at an earlier period, he was born with a physical body combining both sexes. The word "hermaphrodite" entered the English lexicon in the late 14th century.
Zoology.
Sequential hermaphrodites.
Sequential hermaphrodites (dichogamy) occur in species in which the individual is born as one sex, but can later change into the opposite sex. This contrasts simultaneous hermaphrodites, in which an individual may possess fully functional male and female gonads. Sequential hermaphroditism is common in fish (particularly teleost fish) and some jellyfish, many gastropods (such as the common slipper shell), and some flowering plants. While some sequential hermaphrodites can change sex multiple times, most can only change sex once. Sequential hermaphroditism can best be understood in terms of behavioral ecology and evolutionary life history theory, as described in the size-advantage mode first proposed by Michael T. Ghiselin which states that if an individual of a certain sex could significantly increase its reproductive success after reaching a certain size, it would be to their advantage to switch to that sex.
Sequential hermaphrodites can be divided into three broad categories:
Dichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, groupers are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often aquacultured. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the broodstock are extremely valuable individuals.
Simultaneous hermaphrodites.
A simultaneous (or synchronous) hermaphrodite (or homogamous) is an adult organism that has both male and female sexual organs at the same time. Usually, self-fertilization does not occur.
Pseudohermaphroditism.
When spotted hyenas were first discovered by explorers, they were thought to be hermaphrodites. Early observations of spotted hyenas in the wild led researchers to believe that all spotted hyenas, male and female, were born with what appeared to be a penis. The apparent penis in female spotted hyenas is in fact an enlarged clitoris, which contains an external birth canal. It can be difficult to determine the sex of wild spotted hyenas until sexual maturity, when they may become pregnant. When a female spotted hyena gives birth, they pass the cub through the cervix internally, but then pass it out through the elongated clitoris.
Humans.
Aside from having an ambiguous-looking external genitalia, true hermaphroditism in humans differs from pseudohermaphroditism in that the person's karyotype has both XX and XY chromosome pairs (47XXY, 46XX/46XY, 46XX/47XXY or 45X/XY mosaic) and having both testicular and ovarian tissue.
One possible pathophysiologic explanation of this rare phenomenon is a parthenogenetic division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an X and the other carrying a Y chromosome), the two fertilized ova are then fused together resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal (ovotestes) and genetic sex.
Another common cause of hermaphroditism is the crossing over of the SRY from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during meiosis. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of testes in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of SOX9, and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of ovarian tissues). Thus, testicular and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual.
Botany.
[[File:Hylocereus undatus 1.jpg|alt=Photo of a flower with a large orange centre and delicate yellow stamen protruding. The centre is surrounded by white petals and a 
halo of green and yellow spikes.|thumb||"Hylocereus undatus", a hermaphrodite plant with both carpels and stamens]]
Hermaphrodite is used in botany to describe a flower that has both staminate (male, pollen-producing) and carpellate (female, ovule-producing) parts. This condition is seen in many common garden plants. A closer analogy to hermaphroditism in botany is the presence of separate male and female flowers on the same individual—such plants are called monoecious. Monoecy is especially common in conifers, but occurs in only about 7% of angiosperm species.
Other uses of the term.
"Hermaphrodite" was used to describe any person incompatible with the biological gender binary, but has recently been replaced by "intersex" in medicine. Humans with typical reproductive organs but atypical clitoris/penis are called pseudohermaphrodites in medical literature. Pseudohermaphroditism also refers to a human possessing both the clitoris and testicles.
People with intersex conditions sometimes choose to live exclusively as one sex or the other, using clothing, social cues, genital surgery, and hormone replacement therapy to blend into the sex they identify with more closely. Some people who are intersex, such as some of those with androgen insensitivity syndrome, outwardly appear completely female or male already, without realizing they are intersex. Other kinds of intersex conditions are identified immediately at birth because those with the condition have a sexual organ larger than a clitoris and smaller than a penis. Intersex is thought by some to be caused by unusual sex hormones; the unusual hormones may be caused by an atypical set of sex chromosomes.
Sigmund Freud (based on work by his associate Wilhelm Fliess) held fetal hermaphroditism to be a fact of the physiological development of humans. He based much of his theory of innate sexuality on that assumption. Similarly, in contemporary times, fetuses before sexual differentiation are sometimes described as female by doctors explaining the process. Neither concept is technically true. Before this stage, humans are simply undifferentiated and possess a Müllerian duct, a Wolffian duct, and a genital tubercle.

Ignacio Núñez Soler

Ignacio Núñez Soler was a distinguished plastic artist. His work show high amount of social commitment, because he represents in it people from his hometown (Asunción) in scenes of day to day life, in squares and markets.
He was born in Asunción, Paraguay, on July 31, 1891, son of Adolfo R. Soler and Ascención Núñez, but he used Núñez Soler when signing his work (using the mother’s last name first before the father’s last name, contrary to what is custom in Paraguay), always being a rebel and nonconformist until his death at the age of 92 years.
Childhood and Youth.
Since early age he was a passionate union man, and defended the rights of the workers. He did not paint artistically; he was a painter of houses. 
But then he started to paint the staging of Julio Correa’s (creator of Guaraní theatre) theatre plays. Since then, he explored the plastic language and grew as an artist. He painted mostly houses, squares, the market “guazú”, the Uruguayan square, festivities and other folkloric scenes.
Ticio Escobar, critic and scholar in visual arts in Paraguaya writes about Soler: “The paintings of Ignacio are documents of narrative and meticulous character about Asunción in the first half of the 20th century, a city condemned by the chaos of a sudden modernization. But his testimony is entwined with personal anecdotes and a fresh but firm preoccupation for social matters and focused on the popular optics and a notable expressive looseness. These complex elements make the work of Núñez Soler a unique case in our plastic, his paintings should not be taken in account just because of the esthetic value but also as a part of the Paraguayan history that have not been previously recorded…”
Work.
Since 1931 and for over half a century, he was present in several exhibitions, individually and collectively and also internationally, participating in the Biennial exhibitions of São Paulo, Brazil. Some of his paintings are in important museums of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, United States and Germany.
He married with Herminia Rosa Blanc and had children.
He died in Asunción, on October 13, 1983.

<doc id="18611277" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18611277" title="Guevara, Spain">
Guevara, Spain

Guevara (in Basque and officially Gebara) is a small village and former municipality through which the Zadorra River runs. The village is administered by the council of Barrundia and situated in the province of Álava, in the Basque Autonomous Community, Spain. 
There is a local festival dedicated to the Assumption of Mary on August 15.
Historic development.
Guevara is first attested in Roman times as lying in the territory of the Varduli, thought to be probably Celts according to ongoing discussion. The name appears as "Gebala", linguistically related to cognate Gothic ""gibla"" or Greek ""kephale"", 'head, prominence'. However, no archaeological findings related to that period have been unearthed to date.
Records are mute during the early Middle Ages, but we hear of Guevara again in the 11th century in a document referred to the counts of Oñati (Oñate). The place is renowned for the role played by the lords of Guevara in the bloody Basque Party Wars of the late Middle Ages and their castle conspicuous from miles away at the top of a hill.

The Brotherhood of Guevara ("Hermandad de Guevara") formerly administered the village of Guevara, as well as Elguea, Etura and Urízar, but after the municipal reforms of the 19th century, the Brotherhood was converted into a municipality. In 1885, the municipality was integrated into that of Barrundia.

United States Immigration Station, Angel Island

Angel Island Immigration Station was an immigrant processing facility on Angel Island, in the San Francisco Bay. It opened in 1910 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is now the site of a museum. The museum and grounds were renovated and reopened to the public in February 2009. President Barack Obama, on the day of his inauguration declared January 21 as national Angel Island Day in honor of all the immigrants who suffered long periods of detention before they were admitted to America. 
History.
Asian immigration can be dated back to "1788 with a crew of Chinese shipbuilders, carpenters, metal workers, and sailors." The government responded to the influx of immigration by instating a series of exclusion acts. Asian immigration quotas began with the Page Act of 1875, which essentially eliminated standard citizenship rights to the Chinese-Americans, and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 which essentially banned all Chinese immigration. Citizenship issues arose and Angel Island, "the Ellis Island of the West," officially opened as an immigration station in 1910 lasting through the Great Depression until 1940 when an electrical fire burned down the administration building. Angel Island Immigration Station served as the processing center for most of the 56,113 Chinese immigrants who are recorded as immigrating or returning from vacation in China. The reason this number is so large, even though the 1882 Exclusion Act was renewed in 1892 and 1902, is because in 1924 the Johnson–Reed Act, including the National Origins Act and Immigration Act of 1924 (Asian Exclusion Act), limited the number of immigrants who could be admitted from any country to 2% of the number of people from that country who were already living in the United States. Asian countries were not specifically mentioned in the list of quotas. They were in the category of "All others: 1,900" out of a total of 165,000 immigrants.
Immigrant perspectives.
The predominantly Chinese immigrants who were detained at Angel Island were not welcomed in the United States. As recounted by one detained in 1940: “When we arrived, they locked us up like criminals in compartments like the cages at the zoo.” Held in these “cages” for weeks, often months, individuals were subjected to rounds of interrogations to assess the legitimacy of their immigration applications. These interrogations were long, tiring, and stressful. Immigrants were made to recall minute details about their home and claimed relations—how many steps led up to your front door? Who lived in the third house in the second row of houses in your village? The interpreters for the proceedings may have not have spoken the particular dialect of the immigrant competently; most Chinese immigrants were from southern China at that time, many spoke Cantonese. It was difficult to pass the interrogations, and cases were appealed many times over before one could leave the island and enter the United States. Often, successful immigrants produced elaborate instruction manuals that coached fellow detainees in passing interrogations; if anyone was caught with these manuals, they would most likely be deported.
Many of the detainees turned to poetry as expression—they spilled their emotions onto the very walls that contained them. Some of the poems are bitter and angry, others placid and contemplative; all, however, read with a heavy sadness.
Another example:
Current implications.
Angel Island Immigration station has long been overshadowed by Ellis Island although both served the same purpose. There has been major lack of awareness about Angel Island Immigration Station and the struggle of the immigrants who were detained there for days, weeks, months and in a few cases years. Most Asian American immigrants, especially from the West Coast, have at least someone in their family genealogy who has been directly or indirectly affected by the Angel Island Immigration Station.
The museum grounds are open daily for a small fee (closed Mondays and Tuesdays). The barracks building is available by self-guided and guided tours (closed Mondays and Tuesdays). The mess hall directly across from the detention barracks has a 20-minute video documentary on the Angel Island Immigration Station that can be played at will.

Boettner was the son of Alfred Boettner (German) and María Victoria Gautier (French). While young he was sent to Germany to study in primary and secondary school. He studied medicine at the University of Jena, Hamburg and later in Buenos Aires, where he graduated in 1926.
Medicine.
He was a man with sharp mind and intense spiritual sensibility and that made him outstand in his professional life. He started to practice medicine as a professor of Infectious Diseases in the Faculty of Medicine in the Muñiz Hospital in Buenos Aires.
In 1929 he moved to Asunci;on, with the intention of dedicating fully to his specially, “tuberculosis”, at the time that disease was a great problem, it affected a big part of the population, plus there were just a few drugs that could serve to treat it and the use of X-rays was still very restricted.
The campaign against the tuberculosis had a great impulse with him in charge. In a beginning he was Director of the Tuberculosis Clinic. Later he was Director of the “Fight against Tuberculosis”, which with time became a department in the Public Health Ministry.
He was professor of the Faculty of Medicine of Asunción, teaching about Tuberculosis, until 1941. 
Short time after arriving in Paraguay, Doctor Boettner published several valuable studies about medicine. In 1930 he published his work about “Evolution of Tuberculosis”, “Study of the Vertebral Spine”, “Congenital Malformations of the Respiratory System”, “Respiratory Pathology”, “Manual about Tuberculosis” in 1939, “Silicosis in Paraguay”, “Greek and Latin Etymology for Medical uses” in 1945.
In 1945 he inaugurated the “Sanatorio Bella Vista” (Hospital Bella Vista), built by his own impulse and destined to the medical attention of people with pulmonary diseases. In this institution many renowned specialist in thorax surgery were educated. Today it is an important hospital located in the Venezuela Street, in Asunción and it’s named “Hospital Juan Max Boettner”.

His name acquired even more importance when his first musical arrangements were known. As a great piano player and composer he left many samples of his delicate interpretation of folkloric and also classical music. His musical work was rich in motivation. Among others, he composed in 1957 “Himno Nacional”, “Danzas Tradicionales del Paraguay” and “Música y músicos del Paraguay” and one didactic play called “Cómo reconocer el estilo y el autor de una obra musical”; “Fantasía esclava”, “Sinfonía en Mi Menor”, “El alma del inca”, “Yrendague”, “Sinfonía Paraguaya” and “Canciones folklóricas paraguayas”.
