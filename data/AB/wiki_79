Franz Hunolt

Franz Hunolt (b. 31 March 1691, at Siegen; d. 12 September 1746, at Trier.) was a popular German preacher.
Life.
The name of this renowned preacher is spelled in various ways in the catalogues of the Society of Jesus -- Humold, Hunoldt, and (usually) Hunolt. At the age of nine years he entered the Jesuit college of his native town and six years later he attended the Jesuit school at Cologne to study philosophy. Having completed the three years' course as master of arts, he entered the Society of Jesus there on 18 May. After a novitiate of two years at Trier he was sent to Geyst (near Münster, in Westphalia) for one year to prepare himself to teach. After this he taught in the gymnasium at Cologne and also at Aachen to the complete satisfaction of his superiors (summâ cum laude), being at the same time spiritual director of the junior Sodality. In this position he showed proofs of his remarkable oratorical talents. Having completed the theological course of four years and received Holy Orders, he should then have made his tertianship, or third year of probation, but was, during most of that period, employed in giving popular missions, so great had his reputation as a preacher already become. His next appointment was to the chair of logic at Coblenz, where he made his profession, 15 August 1724. It was not until after this year that he was able to follow his true vocation; he was assigned to the cathedral pulpit at Trier, and continued in that employment for nineteen years, to the satisfaction of his superiors, and the spiritual advancement of the city. Besides this he was much sought after as a confessor, and he also became chaplain of the city prison. His indefatigable activity required robust health, which, unfortunately, Hunolt had not. Chronic weakness of the heart rendered it impossible for him to preach; consequently, in 1743, he was transferred to the position of master of novices at Trier, and died there three years later.
Work.
Hunolt's great collection of sermons is still widely used. No fewer than six folio editions of the original work appeared between 1740 and 1813. After the latter date, versions in more modern German began to be published; one in twenty-five volumes appeared at Ratisbon, 1842–47; another modern version appeared about the same time at Graz, in twenty-four volumes. There have been several editions of both the Ratisbon version and the Graz, while abridgements and selected sermons have frequently been published, and are frequently republished with much success. Universally esteemed, the work was translated in Dutch, French, and Polish; an English version in twelve volumes was completed in 1898.
Hunolt's idea was to treat the entire field of morals in his sermons thoroughly and completely. Each of the six volumes contains seventy-two sermons, and the various divisions in each volume are indicated by sub-titles, such as "The Christian Attitude towards Life"; "The Wicked Christian"; "The Penitent Christian"; "The Good Christian"; "The Last End of Christians"; "The Christian's Model". This prodigious mass of material is distributed most appropriately over the entire ecclesiastical year. How popular, and at the same time profound, Hunolt's expositions are, is best proved by the fact that numerous excerpts are included in all anthologies and textbooks of religious rhetoric as standard. A competent critic (Kraus) has eulogized Hunolt's sermons in the following words: "At a time when German pulpit oratory had degenerated into utter bad taste and brainless insipidity, these sermons are distinguished by noble simplicity, pure Christian sentiment, and genuine apostolic ideas no less than by the felicitous use of Holy Writ, abundance of thought and pregnant language." And finally, we must call attention to the cultural value of Hunolt's work especially for the district of Trier, inasmuch as we may gather therefrom a fairly correct picture of life in the Trier of his day.

High Hampton Inn Historic District

The High Hampton Inn Historic District is an estate and resort nestled in the mountains of western North Carolina, in the Cashiers Valley in Jackson County. Originally the summer home of the prosperous Hampton family of South Carolina, the property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Wealthy planter Wade Hampton II purchased in Cashiers Valley as an escape from the summer heat, humidity, and malaria of the Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina region. The property became a favorite hunting preserve for the Hampton family and their friends. Young Wade Hampton III learned to ride horses at High Hampton, a skill that served him well as a leading Confederate cavalry commander during the American Civil War.
In the 1880s, the property passed into the hands of Hampton II's three daughters. They sold it in 1890 to their niece Caroline Hampton and her new husband, Dr. William Halsted, a prominent surgeon. Halsted purchased several adjoining farms and pieces of property, eventually expanding his holdings to more than . The Halsteds both died in 1922. 
A North Carolina businessman, E. Lyndon McKee, purchased the estate two years later. In 1933, the property was renovated and adapted as the present High Hampton Inn, which opened for business. McKee's descendants still own and operate the resort today, which includes a golf course, spa, recreational area, and restaurant.
The current High Hampton Inn and Country Club consists of . It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

George Evans (bandleader)

George Evans, born London, died 16 February 1993, was an English jazz bandleader, arranger and tenor saxophonist.
Early life and career.
Having started playing ukelele-banjo, he moved on to the saxophone at 14, and was doing local gigs at age 15. He got his first professional job in Sonny Winter's Band at 16, before going on to join Al Lever's band.
In the early 1930s he was doing arrangements for Freddie Bretherton's Band as well as Syd Lipton’s band.
In 1938, together with fellow saxophonist Harry Hayes he joined Geraldo and between 1938 and 1942 was arranging, singing and playing tenor for the orchestra. He was the composer of Geraldo’s signature tune "Hello Again".
From 1940-46, he was a member of the Welsh Guards Band, although like many servicemen at the time, he carried on playing with civilian bands as well as appearing on broadcasts with George Melachrino’s combined Forces Orchestra.
One of his bands at around that time, Saxes 'n’ Sevens, was made up of three altos, four tenors, and four musicians in the rhythm section, including leading saxophonists of the day: Hayes, Les Gilbert and Tommy Bradbury, on altos; himself, Jimmy Durrant, Poggy Pogson, Tommy Bradbury, Andy McDevitt, Norman Maloney, and Aubrey Frank on tenors. Later lineups would also include Pete King. The rhythm section consisted of, at various times, Joe Deniz on guitar, Wilkie Davidson on bass, Bobby Midgeley or Kenny Clare on drums and George Shearing or Ronnie Selby on piano. 
Shortly after leaving the Welsh Guards Evans was admitted to a sanatorium with T.B. and his brother, Les took the band on tour.
Newcastle Days.
Retiring in 1957, he returned to playing with local Newcastle bands and school youth orchestras in 1980. During this time George founded "The George Evans Young Peoples Swing Band" who rehearsed every Sunday morning at the Peoples' Theater in Newcastle. The band rehearsed popular swing tunes like "Night and Day", "Blue Moon" & "The Grasshopper's Dance". The arrangements were meticulous in detail & voicing & quickly became very popular with the band.
George also played regularly on a Friday evening with the Arthur Mowatt band at the Corner House. Moonlight In Vermont
Role Call.
Other leading UK musicians who at one time were members of Evans’ bands include Jimmy Staples, Don Rendell, Charles Chapman, Tony Symes, Jackie Sprague, Bill Geldard, Jock Cummings, Jack Parnell, Pat Dodd, Jack Llewellyn, Kenny Baker, Billy Riddick, Cliff Haines, Izzy Duman, Bill Apps, Eric Jupp, Malcolm Mitchell, Don Raine, Dougie Cooper, Arthur Greenslade, Ricky Derges, Ted Hunt, Bill Jackson, Graham Smith, Frank Pritchard, Hank Shaw, and Denis Shirley, Charlie Payne, Frank Rogers, Roy Ringrose, Freddie Syer, Ronnie Chandler, Erik Maxwell, Dennis Hughes, Syd Dowel, Kenny Kaye, Jimmy Paul and Shirley Gray on vocals.

Harold Hopkins

Harold Horace Hopkins FRS (1918–1994) was a renowned British physicist. His Wave Theory of Aberrations, (published by Oxford University Press 1950), is central to all modern optical design and provides the mathematical analysis which enables the use of computers to create the wealth of high quality lenses available today. In addition to his theoretical work, his many inventions are in daily use throughout the world. These include zoom lenses, coherent fibre-optics and more recently the rod-lens endoscopes which 'opened the door' to modern key-hole surgery. He was the recipient of many of the world's most prestigious awards and was twice nominated for a Nobel Prize. His citation on receiving the Rumford Medal from the Royal Society in 1984 stated: "In recognition of his many contributions to the theory and design of optical instruments, especially of a wide variety of important new medical instruments which have made a major contribution to clinical diagnosis and surgery."
Biography.
He was born into a poor family in the slums of Leicester in 1918 and his remarkable mind was recognised early on. Due to his own genius and the good fortune of having the support of both his family and teachers, he obtained one of only two scholarships (in the whole of Leicestershire) enabling him to attend The Gateway Grammar School. There he excelled especially in the arts (English, History and Languages). However, the Headmaster, recognising his exceptional gift for mathematics, directed him into science.
So he read physics and maths at University College, Leicester, graduated in 1939 with a first and then began a PhD in Nuclear Physics. However this was cancelled on the outbreak of war, and he went to work instead for Taylor, Taylor & Hobson where he was introduced to optical design.
For some reason he was not given reserved-occupation status, which led to his being called up and being trained briefly in 'blowing up bridges'. (He was obviously a natural, quickly rising to the rank of 'acting unpaid lance corporal' and winning a prize for his speed at dismantling and reassembling his rifle.) The error of this placement soon became apparent and he was set to work on designing optical systems for the rest of the war and was able at the same time to work on a thesis for his PhD, which was obtained in 1945.
He began a research fellowship at Imperial College London in 1947, lecturing in optics. The next twenty years saw him emerge as one of the foremost authorities in the field of optics. In addition to his own work, he attracted a large number of high quality PhD students from all over the world, many of whom became senior academics and researchers themselves. His reputation as a teacher was second to none. (When he moved to Reading University in 1967 to take up the newly created chair in optics, many of his former MSc students at Imperial would travel to Reading to attend his lectures.) He always believed that his primary responsibility was his teaching and that the research came second. However he was also totally convinced that teaching and scientific research were vitally important to each other. "Only when you try to teach something do you discover whether you truly understand it."
The secret of his success lay to a great extent in the very advanced mathematics that he brought to the subject. The development of the mathematical description of the behaviour of optical systems was at the centre of his life's work in physics – the application of which produced so many world famous inventions. He chose to remain at Reading in the post of Professor of Applied Physical Optics until his official retirement in 1984, declining the numerous top appointments he was offered. He believed the continuation of his teaching and research work to be more important and far more rewarding personally. However, he took great delight in having conferred on him the Honorary Fellowships of all the medical Royal Colleges in Britain, together with the highest awards of many of the world's premier scientific bodies including (in 1973) the Fellowship of the Royal Society itself. He was awarded the 1990 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 11 April 1991, and was titled 'The development of the modern endoscopes – present and future prospects'. This award, for his work on endoscopes, was unusual in that normally it is made to someone working in the field of medicine. He was awarded the 1978 Frederic Ives Medal by the OSA.
What is rather less well-known about Harold Hopkins is that he was also a politically committed man of the left, being an early member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Coming from a poor and under-privileged background, he understood how essential equal opportunities and good education were if ordianry working class youngsters like himself were to prosper in society.
Major inventions and improvements.
Zoom lenses.
Following an approach in the late 1940s from the BBC, who wanted a single lens to replace the classic "turret' of different focal length lenses, he produced the now familiar Zoom lens. Although there had been earlier attempts to produce a lens which could achieve continuously varying magnification without re-focusing, none of them could provide a good quality image throughout their zooming and aperture ranges. The design of a zoom lens is enormously more complicated and difficult than that of a fixed focal length. The performance of the Hopkins designed Zoom lens was such that it revolutionised television images especially outside-broadcasts and opened the way to the ubiquitous use of zooming in modern visual media. It was all the more remarkable for being produced pre-computer, the ray-tracing calculations being performed on large desk top electro-mechanical machines such as the Marchant Calculator. Even so the early zooms still fell short of the fixed lenses. The application of computer design-programs based on his Wave theory of Aberrations in conjunction with new types of glass, coatings and manufacturing techniques has transformed the performance of all types of lenses. Whilst Zooms can never out-perform fixed focal lengths, the differences are no longer significant in most applications.
Coherent Fiber Optics, Fibroscopes and Endoscopes.
Fibre Optics<br>
The ancient Romans knew how to heat and draw-out glass into fibres of such small diameter that they became flexible. They also observed that light falling on one end was transmitted to the other. ( We now know this is due to multiple reflections at the internal surface of the fibre.) These multiple reflections in a sense mix the light beams together thereby preventing an image being transmitted by a single fibre – (more accurately, the different path-lengths experienced by individual light-rays alter their relative phases so rendering the beam "incoherent" and thus unable to reconstitute the image.) The end result is that the light emerging from a single fibre will be some kind of average of the intensity and colour of the light falling on the 'front' end.
Coherent Fibre Optics<br>
If a bundle of fibres could be arranged such that the ends of the fibres were in matching locations at either end, then focusing an image on one end of the bundle would produce a 'pixel-ated' version at the further end which could be viewed via an eyepiece or captured by a camera. A German medical student, Heinrich Lamm produced a crude coherent bundle in the 1930s of perhaps 400 fibres. Many of the fibres were misaligned and it lacked proper imaging optics. It also suffered from leakage where adjacent fibres touched; which degraded the image still further. To produce a useful image, the bundle would need to contain not a few hundred but tens of thousands of fibres all correctly aligned. In the early 1950s, Hopkins devised a way to accomplish this. He proposed winding a single continuous length of fibre in a figure-of-eight around a pair of drums. Then, when sufficient turns had been added, a short section could be sealed in resin, cut through and the whole straightened out to produce the required "coherent bundle". Having polished the ends, he was then able to add the optics he had designed to provide an objective and eyepiece. Once enclosed in a protective flexible jacket the 'fibroscope' (now more commonly called a fiberscope) was born. Details of this invention were published in papers by Hopkins in Nature in 1954 and Optica Acta in 1955 . However, the bare fibres still suffered from light leakage where they touched. At the same time a Dutchman, Abraham van Heel was also trying to produce coherent bundles and had been researching the idea of cladding each fibre to reduce this 'cross-talk'. In fact he published details of his work in the very same issue of Nature. Eventually a system for cladding fibres with a layer of glass of lower refractive index was developed (see Larry Curtis et al.) which reduced the leakage to such an extent that the full potential of the fiberscope was realised.
Fibroscopes and Borescopes<br>
Fibroscopes have proved extremely useful both medically and industrially (where the term Borescope is usually employed). Other innovations included the use of additional fibres to channel light to the objective end from a powerful external source (typically a xenon arc lamp) thereby achieving the high level of full spectrum illumination needed for detailed viewing and good quality colour photography. At the same time this allowed the fibroscope to remain cool, which was especially important in medical applications. (The previous use of a small filament lamp on the tip of the endoscope had left the choice of either viewing in a very dim red light or increasing the light output at the risk of burning the inside of the patient.) In the medical application, alongside the improvement to the optics, came the ability to 'steer' the tip via controls in the endoscopist's hands and innovations in remotely operated surgical instruments contained within the body of the endoscope itself. It was the beginning of key-hole surgery as we know it today. These advances were, of course equally useful industrially.
Rod-lens Endoscopes<br>
There are, however, physical limits to the image quality of a fibroscope. In modern terminology, a bundle of say 50,000 fibres gives effectively only a 50,000 pixel image – in addition to which, the continued flexing in use, breaks fibres and so progressively loses pixels. Eventually so many are lost that the whole bundle must be replaced (at considerable expense). Hopkins realised that any further optical improvement would require a different approach. Previous rigid endoscopes suffered from very low light transmittance and extremely poor image quality. The surgical requirement of passing surgical tools as well as the illumination system actually within the endoscope's tube – which itself is limited in dimensions by the human body – left very little room for the imaging optics. The tiny lenses of a conventional system required supporting rings that would obscure the bulk of the lens' area. They were also incredibly hard to manufacture and assemble – and optically nearly useless. The elegant solution that Hopkins devised (in the 1960s) was to use glass rods to fill the air-spaces between the 'little lenses', which could then be dispensed with altogether. These rods fitted exactly the endoscope's tube – making them self-aligning and requiring of no other support. They were much easier to handle and utilised the maximum possible diameter available. As with the fibroscopes, a bundle of glass-fibers would relay the illumination from a powerful external source. With the appropriate curvature and coatings to the rod ends and optimal choices of glass-types, all calculated and specified by Hopkins, the image quality was transformed – light levels were increased by as much as eightyfold with no heat; resolution of fine detail was finally achieved; colours were now true; and diameters as small as a few millimetres were possible. With a high quality 'telescope' of such small diameter, the tools and illumination system could be comfortably housed within an outer tube.
Hopkins patented his lens system in 1959. Seeing promise in this system, Karl Storz bought the patent and in 1967 began to produce endoscopic instruments with a tremendously brilliant image and superb illumination. Thus began a long and productive partnership between Hopkins and Storz. Whilst there are regions of the body that will forever require flexible endoscopes (principally the gastrointestinal tract), the rigid rod-lens endoscopes have such exceptional performance that they are to this day the instrument of choice and in reality have been the enabling factor in modern key-hole surgery.
Modulation Transfer Function.
Previous to his work, the resolution of an optical system was mainly assessed using 3-bar resolution charts, with the limit of resolution being the main criterion. But Harold studied at the University of Besançon with Duffieux, who had already begun to lay the foundations of Fourier optics. The seminal paper, which he presented in 1962 when he was awarded the Thomas Young prize of The Physical Society of London, was one of the first to establish the modulation transfer function (MTF) – sometimes called the contrast transfer function (CTF) – as the leading measure of image quality in image-forming optical systems. Briefly, the contrast of the image of a sinusoidal object is defined as the difference in intensities between the peaks and troughs, divided by the sum. The spatial frequency is the reciprocal of the period of the pattern in this image, normally measured in cycles/mm. The contrast, normalised to make the contrast at zero spatial frequency equal to unity, expressed as a function of spatial frequency, is the definition of the modulation transfer function. MTF is still used by optical designers as the principal criterion of image quality, although its measurement in production is less widespread than it used to be. Today it is calculated from the lens data using software such as OSLO, Zemax
and Code V.
'Laserdisc and CD' optics.
Originally an analogue video play-back system, the Philips laserdisc format was adapted to digital in the late 1970s and was the forerunner of the CD and DVD. The digital data is encoded as a series of depressions in a reflective disc. They are arranged along a spiral path such that a laser can read them in sequence (in similar fashion to a stylus following the groove on a vinyl record). The laser must be focused onto and track this path and in addition, the reflected beam must be collected, diverted and measured. The prototype optics to achieve this was an expensive glass-lens arrangement. Hopkins was able to show, through a complete mathematical analysis of the system, that with a carefully calculated geometry, it was possible to use a single piece of transparent moulded-plastic instead. This continues to be a major factor in the low cost of laser disc-readers (such as CD players).
The Hopkins Building, Reading University.
On 12 June 2009 the Hopkins Building was officially opened by his son Kelvin Hopkins, the Labour MP for Luton North. This brought together under one roof, the biomedical and pharmaceutical research interests of the University. Whilst not directly involved in the applications of optics, this new facility, in its pursuance of the highest standards of teaching and research, provided an opportunity to honour one of the University's most illustrious academics.

Papal election, 1088

Papal election of March 12, 1088, convoked after the death of Pope Victor III, elected Cardinal Odon de Lagery who took the name of Urban II.
Pope Victor III died on September 16, 1087, at Montecassino. Shortly before his death he recommended the election of Cardinal Odon de Lagery as his successor. Rome at that time was under control of Antipope Clement III, who was supported by the Emperor Henry IV of Germany, and there was no hope for its quick recovery. In this situation the adherents of Victor III assembled on March 9, 1088, at Terracina under the protection of Norman army to elect the new Pope. Besides Cardinal-Bishops, who were the sole electors of the Pope, at the electoral assembly in the episcopal church of SS. Pietro e Cesareo there were present also the representatives of the two lower orders of cardinals, over 40 bishops and abbots, as well as Benedetto, prefect of Rome and Countness Matilda of Tuscany. Initially the usual three days of fasting and prayer were proclaimed, and the meeting adjourned till Sunday, March 12, 1088. On that day the cardinals and the rest of the present churchmen and laymen assembled again in the same church. The Cardinal-Bishops of Albano, Tusculum and Porto together proposed the election of Odon de Lagery, Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, who was designated by Victor III. He accepted his election and took the name Urban II. The election had been publicly announced by Cardinal Peter Igneus of Albano. On the same day new Pope was enthroned and celebrated the inauguration mass. It was not until November 1088 that Urban II was able to travel to Rome.
Cardinal-electors.
According to the decree of Nicholas II In Nomine Domini (1059) Cardinal-Bishops of the suburbicarian sees were the sole electors of the Pope. In March 1088 there were six Cardinal Bishops:
Assistant electors.
Two Cardinals of the lower ranges, one Cardinal-Priest and one Cardinal Deacon assisted at the election:

Caldwell County Courthouse Historic District

The Caldwell County Courthouse Historic District is a historic district located in Lockhart, Texas, the seat of Caldwell County. The historic district encompasses 67 buildings on across downtown Lockhart. One building included in the historic district, the Emmanuel Episcopal Church, was previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 3, 1978.
Courthouse.
The current Caldwell County Courthouse was built in 1893-1894. There is debate as to whether the design was by San Antonio architect Alfred Giles or Henri E. M. Guindon, who worked for Giles but not during the time the plans were sold to Caldwell County. The design is Second Empire-style architecture. The cornerstone was laid on August 15, 1893 and the county commissioners received the building on March 19, 1894. The walls are built of rusticated masonry and cream colored limestone and trimmed with red sandstone specified to be from Muldoon, Texas. In 1969 the building received air conditioning and had an elevator installed. Major restoration in 2000 brought the courthouse back to its historic appearance. The courthouse was rededicated in April 2000.

Career.
Born in Ipswich, Stafford joined local amateur club Coplestonians in his teens, where he spent eight years, before joining Achilles in 1985. Three years later he signed for Diss Town. Working in the insurance industry at the time, following trials with Ipswich Town in January 1989, he turned professional after signing for Colchester United on 5 March.

1999–2000 First League of FR Yugoslavia

Statistics of First League of FR Yugoslavia in season 1999/2000.
Overview.
Twenty one teams contested the league championship this season. Red Star Belgrade managed to win it in the end with four points more than eternal rivals FK Partizan.
Tragedy at the Eternal Derby: death of Aca Radović.
The season was marred by the tragic event that occurred on October 31, 1999 during Partizan vs. Red Star tie (the 113th edition of the so-called Večiti derbi) when 17-year-old Red Star fan Aleksandar "Aca" Radović from Opovo was killed by a signaling rocket fired from within the stadium. Radović, a third-year student at First Belgrade Gymnasium, was supporting his team from the Partizan Stadium's north end when in 20th minute of the match he got hit in the chest by a signaling rocket fired from the opposite end of the stadium, which is where Partizan fans were located. Partizan just scored a goal to go up 1-0 and certain members of their fans Grobari fired a series of ship signaling rockets from the south stand where they traditionally gather as a way of celebrating the goal. Most of those rockets landed on the stadium's north stand where Red Star's fans Delije always gather, and one of them hit the unfortunate teenager right in the chest near his throat, cutting his aorta. He died almost instantly as he was being moved from the stands onto the stadium's athletic track and into the ambulance car.
Amazingly, the match was not stopped and the two teams continued playing, a decision that led to a lot of public criticism directed at two clubs, the football league, and the FA.
Further investigation conducted by the police discovered that the particular rocket that killed Radović was fired by Partizan fan Majk Halkijević (born 1975) from Krnjača. In addition to Halkijević, three other individuals Nenad "Kec" Kecojević (born 1976) from Mali Mokri Lug, Aleksandar "Sale" Aleksić (born 1975) from Krnjača, and Zoran "Prcko" Jovanović (born 1974) from Belgrade were also firing rockets at the stadium on the same occasion. According to the investigation, the ship signaling rockets were originally purchased in Greece before being smuggled into Serbia. In Belgrade, Grobari leader Zoran "Čegi" Živanović bought 10 of them along with 60 flares, all from Mirko Urban. Čegi brought the stuff to Partizam Stadium on the day of the derby, handing it over to Časlav "Čaja" Kurandić. Čaja then snuck the flares and rockets into the stadium with help from FK Partizan's equipment manager Branko "Gavran" Vučićević who hid them inside the bags with team's sports equipment. Once inside the team's dressing room the packages with flares and rockets were passed to Goran "Tuljak" Matović and Dragan "Lepi Gaga" Petronić through the dressing room's window. From then on the packages were carried through east stand and onto the south stand through the protective fence while Nikola "Džoni" Dedović diverted steward's attention. On the south stand, group leader Čegi distributed the rockets and flares to certain number of Grobari, including Majk Halkijević.
At the trial that dragged on for almost two years, the accused were not tried for murder but for a lesser charge of disturbing public order and causing general endangerment. The verdict was delivered on March 1, 2001 with Halkijević getting one year and 11 months sentence. Aleksandar "Sale" Aleksić got one year and eight months while Nenad "Kec" Kecojević, Zoran "Čegi" Živanović (Grobari leader) and Časlav "Čaja" Kurandić got year and a half. Furthermore, Dragan "Lepi Gaga" Petronić and Srđan Šalipurović got six months, while Mirko Urban also known as Mirko Pekar (Mirko the Baker), accused of selling the rockets to Grobari, got year and a half. Others who were on the accused list but received no sentence were Zoran "Prcko" Jovanović, Nikola "Džoni" Dedović, Branko "Gavran" Vučićević, and Goran "Tuljak" Matović.

1st King's Immemorial Infantry Regiment of AHQ

The King's Own Immemorial 1st Infantry Regiment of the Spanish Army is considered to be the oldest armed unit in the world. There is certain proof of this and according to what the chronicles mention, King Ferdinand III, "The Saint," in 1248, during the conquest of Seville, with some of his men-at-arms, assaulted and took a tower. Seemingly, with such boldness and bravery they gained the admiration of the King. The campaign finished and with the consequent disbandment of troops, King Ferdinand decided to permanently keep with him said force, giving origin to the permanence of the Armies, that is to say, the origin of itself.
On 28 August 1632, on the initiative of Philip IV, a special Corps of troops was ordered to be formed with veteran soldiers, reenlistments and Knights of noble ancestry - men so skilled that they only took arms when the Monarch assumed command in person, designating it "King's Guard Colonelship." Its organization commenced in Almansa in 1634, its force fixed at fifteen companies with 90 harquebusiers, 40 musketeers, and 60 corslets and pikemen each. Later, in 1638, it was augmented to twenty. Its first Colonel, Count Duke of Olivares, Don Gaspar de Guzmán, whose post was the recently created "King's Guard Colonelship," was in command of very distinguished soldiers of great renown. In 1640, Philip IV elevated it to the category of King's Guard Regiment and in 1664 to Castile Tercio. From 1701 to 1710 it was dedicated to its ancient mission, guarding the Monarch, and it was in 1707 when it received the designation Castile, and in 1710 that of Castile Immemorial Infantry Regiment. It gained glory in the Spanish War of Succession and the Italian Campaigns (1718-1749), eventually it received the name King's Infantry Regiment on 7 January 1766. That same year, King Charles III, persuaded by the antiquity of the Regiment, declared it the King's Immemorial.
After diverse historical changes in losing and receiving its name, it received its present designation in 1995.
Traditionally, the Regiment is linked to the Spanish Royal Household, all the Princes of Asturias since 1862 are enrolled as Honorary soldiers in the 1st Company. Following the tradition Don Felipe de Borbón y Grecia (Prince of Asturias and heir to the Crown) assumed his post as a soldier in 1977.
Traditional uniform.
Instead of uniformity and as what is practiced in other countries with a military tradition, in Spain as well, King Juan Carlos I in 1981 accepted the proposal of CSA to equip two companies, which could render honors and participate in established ceremonies special in character, with the uniform and armaments of the end of the reign of Charles III. 
The period chosen was that from 1780 to 1786, during which in accordance with the organization of Spanish Infantry, each Regiment had two Battalions, each one formed of nine companies, one of grenadiers and eight of fusiliers. The description in detail of the uniform is as follows:
Fusilier uniform.
It had a white uniform, with the green emblem, that of the King, by special grace it was dressed elegantly in the colors of the Royal Household troops, and as a special grace they wore "botoneras" on the vest and dress coat.
Grenadier uniform.
To wear this uniform there existed a norm in the selection of grenadier personnel, they must not wear glasses nor a beard; now it is possible to wear a beard (they are the only ones, together with the dragoons, who have the privilege to wear beards). In this era the grenadier company was considered to be a distinction or preference usually chosen over the fusilier companies by the bravest and tallest soldiers. These troops chosen not only for their height, but also for their valor and bravery, posted at the head of the Regiment, escort the Colors and are the first in the trenches. As a vanguard and reconnaissance force, they wear a short saber. The grenadier cap augmented their stature and the brass "mechero" on the strap of the cartridge pouch, in the same way the "sardinetas" which they wore on their cuffs distinguished these preferred companies of the Infantry.
Current functions and structure.
At present the Regiment is the Unit responsible for providing the central seat of Army Headquarters security, services, and support needed for its functioning, it also helps give security to that which the authorities decide. These functions support the fundamental objective of facilitating the functioning of the different Centers and Organisms of which the Headquarters is composed, to be able to achieve the following tasks:
The Regiment in order to execute these functions is organized, in addition to the Command Staff, in the following Units:
In addition to its usual functions it has participated, when it was required, in actions in behalf of the civilian population (ex. Environmental cleaning carried out in Galicia because of the sinking of the Prestige, etc.)

Renville County Courthouse and Jail

The Renville County Courthouse and Jail is a historic building located at 500 East DePue Avenue in Olivia, Minnesota, United States; the seat of Renville County. It was constructed in 1902. 
The first courthouse in Renville County was built in Beaver Falls in 1872. It was originally built as a jail, at a cost of $2000. In 1889 a wood frame building was built, and the 1872 building was again used as the jail. In 1895 the city of Olivia won a battle to become the county seat, and court business was held in a local business building. A court decision returned the county seat to Beaver Falls for two years, but then Olivia finally won the county seat permanently in 1900. Architect Fremont D. Orff from Minneapolis designed the building, which was built at a cost of $88,000. The building has influences from a few different architectural styles. The corner pavilions and the central tower have segmented blue-green copper domes, suggesting Second Empire architecture. The center pavilion has a porch with balusters, fluted columns, and an oculus-pierced pediment, which reflects Georgian architecture.
The courthouse and jail were added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 13, 1986.

A-Lex

A-Lex is the eleventh studio album by the Brazilian metal band Sepultura. It was released on 23 January 2009 by independent German record label Steamhammer Records. This is the first album featuring new drummer Jean Dolabella, since the departure of Igor Cavalera in 2006.
This is the second concept album released by Sepultura, following 2006's "Dante XXI" which was based on Dante Alighieri's "The Divine Comedy". "A-Lex" is based on the 1962 book "A Clockwork Orange" by Anthony Burgess, which in 1971 was adapted into a film version by Stanley Kubrick.
Album information.
The album was recorded in São Paulo at Trama Studios and mixed at Mega Studios during 2008, since February through the process of composition until August when the band finished the mixing process and revealed the track listing and album title.
Andreas Kisser stated about the influences obtained from Burgess work:
The title is a pun on the main character from the novel, Alex, and the Latin for "without law": a (without) + lex (law); presumably referring to how Alex and his companions behaved.
"A-Lex" is available in three versions: a deluxe digipak with an embossed cover, a regular jewel case and on a vinyl gate-fold LP. On January 16, 2009, the album was released for exclusive listening on last.fm.
Music videos.
Two music videos have been made for the album. The first, "We've Lost You!", was filmed in São Paulo, Brazil, and was released in February 2009. A video for "What I Do!" was released in May 2009. Sepultura performed on the A-Lex World Tour 2009 in Europe and North America.
Reception.
"A-Lex" received positive reviews. New drummer Jean Dolabella, who replaced Igor Cavalera, was well received by fans and media. AllMusic gave "A-Lex" 4 stars out of 5 and called it a "vicious, loud sledgehammer of an album". "Alternative Press" (p. 108) gave it 3.5 stars out of 5 and said, ""A-Lex" deftly fuses the band's many stylistic phases, from the thrash and death metal that launched their career to later explorations of punk, hardcore, groove metal and even tribal rhythms." "Record Collector" (p. 103) gave it 3 stars out of 5 and said, "Much closer to a live, hardcore punk sound than the refined digital crunch of their previous records... As ever with Sepultura, Kisser's slick riffage and the visceral drums are the point."
"A-Lex" sold 5,000 copies in its first week of release in Brazil and 1,600 in its first week of release in the United States.

Zushi Temple

Zushi Temple () or () is a Taoist temple in Sanxia District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, Republic of China. Qingshui Zushi (清水祖師), known locally as Zushi-Gong (袓師公, "Chó·-su-kong"), is the principal god worshiped at Zushi Temple.
History.
Zushi Temple was first built during the Qing Dynasty in 1767 by Hokkien immigrants from Anxi County, Quanzhou Municipality, Fujian Province in China. It has been reconstructed three times. Its last reconstruction, started in 1947, is most well known for being the masterpiece of renown Taiwanese artist, Li Meishu.
Festivals.
Every sixth day of the first month of the Chinese lunar calendar on Zushi-Gong's birthday, Zushi Temple holds a Pigs of God (神豬) Contest. Farmers compete to raise the fattest pig, which during the competition day, the pig is decorated with ornaments. The fattest pig is then sacrificed to Zushi-Gong. In the past few years, this tradition has been met with disapproval by animal rights activists. While the majority of temples that practice this rite have started using symbolic pigs, Zushi Temple in Sanxia still continues the tradition of using a live pig.
Architecture.
Unique among temples, all of the walls and columns of Zushi Temple are sculpted from stone. The details are also carved with a wide variety of styles from ancient to modern, or even western-influenced, due to the western art education of Li Meishu.

Pim Balkestein

Pim Balkestein (born 29 April 1987) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Eerste Divisie side VVV-Venlo. He can also play as a left-back and is the son of ex-footballer Luuk Balkestein.
Career.
Early years.
Balkestein was born in the Dutch city of Gouda on 29 April 1987. He is the son of former Sparta Rotterdam and Feyenoord player Luuk Balkestein. He came through the academy ranks at SC Heerenveen, making the step up from the under-19 squad to the first team for the 2006–07 season. However, the defender would never made a first team appearance for the club. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Balkestein joined Championship side Ipswich Town on trial, impressing manager Jim Magilton enough to be offered a permanent deal following his strong performance in a friendly for Ipswich Town Reserves against Tottenham Hotspur Reserves.
Ipswich Town.
On 16 June 2008, Balkestein signed a two-year contract with Ipswich Town with the option of a further year extension. As a result of the transfer, a fee of £180,000 was paid to his former club SC Heerenveen as compensation. Balkestein made his professional and Football League debut for Ipswich Town on 9 August 2008 in a 2–1 defeat by Preston North End. The 21-year-old defender would go on to make 20 league appearances in total for Ipswich Town during the 2008–09 season. Balkestein also featured for "The Blues" in the First Round of the 2008-09 League Cup in a 4–1 win over Leyton Orient on 12 August 2008 as well as in the Third Round fixture against Wigan Athletic on 24 September 2008 which ended as a 4–1 defeat. The defender also played for Ipswich Town in their 3–1 defeat by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the Fourth Round of the 2008-09 FA Cup on 24 January 2009. On 21 April 2009, Balkestein was named Ipswich Town's "Most Improved Player of the Year", as voted for by the club's coaching staff. At the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Balkestein made 6 league appearances for Ipswich Town before it was announced that he would join League One side Brentford on an initial one-month loan deal on 20 November 2009. The defender made his debut for Brentford on 21 November 2009 in a 1–1 draw with Walsall. On 21 December 2009, Brentford manager Andy Scott extended Balkestein's loan by a further month. The extension was short-lived however, as on 30 December 2009, Balkestein was recalled by his parent club in order to replace injured defender David Wright. Balkestein's last game for Ipswich Town came on 30 January 2010 against the same opposition as his first, Preston North End, in what would end as a 2–0 defeat. On 25 March 2010, Pim Balkestein returned to Brentford on loan until the end of the 2009–10 with a view to a permanent move. On 30 March 2010, Balkestein scored his first football league goal for Brentford in a 3–2 win over Oldham Athletic.
Brentford.
Having made 14 appearances on loan at Brentford during the 2009–10 season, Balkestein joined the Bees on a permanent basis from Ipswich Town for an undisclosed fee on 6 August 2010, signing a three-year deal. The defender made 20 league appearances in total for Brentford during the 2010–11 season. Balkestein scored his second and last goal for the Bees in a 3–2 defeat by Walsall on 12 April 2011. Following the sacking of Andy Scott as Brentford manager on 3 February 2011, however, Balkestein quickly found himself out of favour and deemed surplus to requirements by successor to the post Uwe Rösler. As a result of this, Balkestein was loaned out for almost the entirety of the 2011–12 season. His first loan spell was to League One rivals Rochdale beginning on 19 August 2011 and running until 18 January 2012. Balkestein's debut for Rochdale came in a 2–0 defeat by Oldham Athletic on 20 August 2011. The defender would go on to make just 13 league appearances in total for Rochdale in the 2011–12 season, however, after being blighted by a reoccurring groin injury which forced him to return to his parent club to undergo minor surgery in November 2011. The 24-year-old returned to training at Rochdale on 5 December 2011. However, he would not go on to make another appearance for "The Dale" and subsequently returned to Brentford in January 2012, where he was told by Uwe Rösler that he had no future with the club. Balkestein subsequently joined League Two side AFC Wimbledon on a one-month loan deal on 9 March 2012. Balkestein made his debut for AFC Wimbledon in a 2–1 win over Dagenham & Redbridge on 10 March 2012. The defender would go on to make 6 league appearances in total for "The Dons", however, his loan spell would ultimately be cut short after an X-Ray found that he had broken his toe in a 4–0 win over Burton Albion on 24 March 2012.
AFC Wimbledon.
On 17 July 2012, Balkestein returned to AFC Wimbledon on a permanent deal after being released by Brentford. Balkestein scored his first goal for AFC Wimbledon on 21 August 2012 in a 6–2 defeat by Burton Albion. The 25-year-old defender scored his second for the club on 12 March 2013 in a 3–1 win over Southend United. Having made twenty–four appearances for "The Dons" during his second spell with the club, Balkestein was released by AFC Wimbledon on 14 May 2013.
VVV-Venlo.
After being released by AFC Wimbledon, Balkestein joined Dutch Eerste Divisie side VVV-Venlo on 12 June 2013, signing a three-year deal.

The Forty-First (1956 film)

The Forty-First (, "Sorok pervyy") is a 1956 Soviet film based on the eponymous novel by Boris Lavrenyev. It was directed by Grigori Chukhrai and starred Izolda Izvitskaya and Oleg Strizhenov. The film is set during the Russian Civil War and tells the story of a tragic romance between a female sniper of the Red Army and an officer of the White Army.
Plot.
In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, a small force of Red Army soldiers that survived a crushing defeat by the Whites is forced to flee into the Karakum Desert. Among them is female sniper Maria, who has already claimed thirty-eight enemies dead. When the unit ambushes a camel caravan transporting White soldiers, she kills two of them and tries to shoot their officer, who will be her forty-first, but misses. The man, a lieutenant named Govorukha-Otrok, is carrying a letter from Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak to General Anton Denikin that states he has secret information to be conveyed orally to General Dratsekno. Maria is entrusted with guarding him. Tensions arise between both: the officer is a well-educated aristocrat who is both amused and impressed by the fisherman's orphan Maria's crude attempts to compose Agitprop poetry. When their camels are stolen, their commander decides to send his captive on a boat to their headquarters in Kazalinsk via the Aral Sea. The vessel capsizes in a sudden storm, and only Maria and Otrok remain alive, stranded on an isolated island. The Red soldier treats the White officer when he catches a fever and is slowly charmed by his manners, while he is overcome with gratitude and begins to call her 'Man Friday' with affection. When she demands to know what he means, he tells her the story about Robinson Crusoe. The two fall in love and seem to forget about the war. 
When a boat approaches their isle, they first think these are fishermen and run toward them. Otrok recognizes them as White soldiers and intends to join them. Maria shoots him in the back, killing him. As she realizes he is dead, she runs into the sea and embraces his corpse.
Production.
The film was based on the story of the same name by Boris Lavrenyov, which had already been filmed as a silent film by Yakov Protazanov in 1927. The picture was Grigori Chukhrai's directorial debut. The Mosfilm directorate was reluctant to authorize Koltunov's script, as the portrayal of a love story between Red and White soldiers was deemed inappropriate: the script had to be revised six times. However, Chukhrai had the support of the eminent directors Ivan Pyryev and Mikhail Romm. When the screenplay was discussed in the directorate on 19 April 1955 and several of those present raised the issue, Romm said: "very well! Let every girl fall in love with the enemy and then kill him." After that, it was approved for filming.
Principal photography commenced in spring 1956 and ended in the summer. It was conducted in the Turkmen SSR, in the vicinity of Krasnovodsk and on the Caspian Sea's Cheleken Peninsula; the latter served as the location for the island scenes.
Reception.
"The Forty-First" attracted 25.1 million viewers in the Soviet Union, becoming the tenth most successful picture at the 1956 box office. At the Mosfilm Festival of Young Filmmakers held between the 12th and 15th of April that year, the film won in the categories for Best Film, Best Actor and Best Cinematography. At the 1957 Edinburgh International Film Festival it won an Honorary Diploma. At the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, it also won the Special Jury Prize and was nominated for the Palme d'Or.

Order of Vitéz

Vitéz, or Order of Vitéz ("Vitézi Rend" in Hungarian) (frequently spelled in English as 'Vitez') was a Hungarian order of merit which was founded in 1678. It was awarded as a state honour during two periods of Hungarian history. The Order of Vitéz survives today as an order of chivalry under protection of the royal family of Hungary. 
The Order of Vitéz under Thököly.
The Order of Vitéz (the Hungarian word "Vitéz"' means "valiant soldier" or "galant") was established in 1678 by Imre Thököly (1657-1705). He was a Hungarian nobleman who led a rebellion against 
Leopold I of Austria when he suspended the Constitution and placed Hungary under a directorate headed by the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. Thököly gathered behind him a force of disaffected Hungarians composed mainly of disbanded soldiers and peasantry. His followers were known as 'kuruc' (crusaders), a designation that was also used a century earlier by the followers of another rebel leader, György (George) Dózsa. Appointment to the Vitéz Order was Thököly's way to designate and promote some of his lowly-born followers who distinguished themselves in the struggle and around whom other newer rebels could gather with confidence. 
The Order of Vitéz under Horthy.
In August 1920, the Vitéz Order was revived by Miklós Horthy to serve as an award in the Regency of Hungary. Admittance into the Order was in the gift of the Regent, and initially he restricted membership to men who served with special distinction in World War I. Subsequently, admittance was widened to include both military and civilian supporters of his regime. Members received a badge and were entitled to use the designation "Vitéz" as a prefix to their names. Admission into the Order also carried with it a land grant of 40 cadastral "holds" to an officer, 8 cadastral "holds" to other ranks or civilians (1 cadastral "hold" = c. 1.43 acres). The honour of Vitéz become hereditary, and the three grants (title, badge and land grant) were to be passed on by the recipient to his eldest son. Miklós Horthy was the first to be admitted into the revived Order and was also the Order's Commander in Chief ("Főkapitány"). In 1920 Archduke Joseph August of Austria became the first knight of the Order of Vitéz. New appointments to the order ceased with the end of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1946.
The Order of Vitéz in modern era.
After the end of World War II, veterans' groups including knights appointed by Horthy began work on re-establishing the Order of Vitéz in exile. These efforts were carried largely by monarchist and legitimist groups. In 1953 General Hugó Sónyi ("vitéz Sónyi") re-established the Vitéz Order as an order of chivalry according to traditional statutes. Since 1983 Vitéz Order has been awarded to individuals who have been defenders of Hungarian national interests and culture. The Captains General of the extant order have been:

Satellite Distribution System

The Satellite Distribution System (SADIS) is a worldwide satellite-based broadcast system dedicated to primarily distributing aeronautical meteorological information in line with ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) standards. Together with ISCS, SADIS forms a global distribution system for meteorological information to all member states.
SADIS forms part of the ICAO Aeronautical Fixed Service (AFS).
History.
In Montreal, 1982, the world area forecast system (WAFS) was established by the ICAO Communications/Meteorology to aid in the supply of meteorological information to authorities and users. It was decided that in the final phase of WAFS, the products should be distributed globally by satellite broadcast. Two WAFCs (World Area Forecast Centre) were created, one in Washington, and the other in Bracknell, UK.
Because of limitations in forecasting techniques and telecommunication systems, the project had to be implemented in two phases. Initially, there would, apart from the two WAFCs, be regional area forecast centres (RAFCs). In the final phase the RAFCs would be closed.
Satellite distribution was a prequisite for closing the RAFCs. It was decided that three INTELSAT satellites would be used. Two will be provided by the United States for the distribution of WAFC Washington products over the Americas, Pacific and Eastern Asia. The other was provided by the UK, and became known as SADIS.
The first two-way SADIS terminal was installed at the South African Weather Bureau in Pretoria. A conference attended by a delegation of Met Specialists from all over the world were held at the Kruger National Park. A demonstration of the efficiency of satellite communications was held at the Kruger National Park. MMS installed a SADIS terminal in the Park to display the reception of data from Bracknell. The software for the installation in Pretoria was provided by NetSys International. NetSys also hosted the conference in the Kruger National Park.
Satellites.
The Indian Ocean INTELSAT 604 at 60E is used to cover the ICAO AFI and MID Regions and in the ASIA and EUR Regions as far eastwards as 140E. The uplink is at Whitehill, UK.
SADIS2G.
SADIS2G, introduced in September 2004, are the second generation SADIS system, and are to replace SADIS1G. All users are expected to use SADIS2G by 31 December 2008

Arvid Kramer

Arvid Kramer (born October 2, 1956) is a retired American basketball player, mostly known for being the first overall pick by the Miami Heat of the NBA in the 1988 expansion draft at the age of 31, and furthermore being the only player to be selected in two expansion drafts and never playing for the teams that drafted him. 
He was tall and and played at the center position during most of his basketball career.
Early life.
Arvid Kramer was born in Fulda, Minnesota. He played basketball for Augustana College.
Professional career.
Kramer was drafted by the Utah Jazz in the 3rd round (1st pick, 45th overall) of the 1979 NBA Draft and left college. After the draft, the Jazz made a 2-for-1 trade involving Bernard King, which left no room for Kramer on their roster, so they waived him. He played about a half season in the CBA before being signed to a 10-day contract by the Denver Nuggets on February 28, 1980. He was good enough to later get signed for the remainder of the season.
He only played eight games with the Nuggets in 1979–80. He was left unprotected and selected by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1980 NBA Expansion Draft. The Mavericks had more contracts than roster spots, so Kramer accepted a contract to play for a team in Italy before the 1980 season. He never played in another NBA game and had a long career in Europe, where he played in various leagues in Italy, France and Germany. He retired as a player in 1996 and worked as a general manager for the Bonn team (in Germany) from 1999 to 2005. 
The expansion Miami Heat of the NBA made him the first overall pick in the 1988 expansion draft at the age of 31. The Dallas Mavericks wanted to make sure that their players Uwe Blab, Steve Alford or Bill Wennington, who were left unprotected, would not be selected, so they offered the Miami Heat the rights to Arvid Kramer and their first choice (No. 20) in the college draft (which later would turn out to become Kevin Edwards). He never played for the Heat.
Personal life.
Kramer met his first and second wives in Germany. As of 2010, he lives in San Diego, California, where works as a youth basketball instructor.

Robin Hill Cemetery

Robin Hill Cemetery is a historic cemetery founded in 1817, located on Donald Lynch Boulevard in Marlborough, Massachusetts overlooking the Assabet River. Robin Hill Cemetery is the community's second smallest burial ground, with only 18 marked stones. However, while it is second smallest by size, Robin Hill Cemetery has the fewest marked graves, though it is highly likely that there are more graves here, either unmarked or having lost their markers. Most of the marked graves date to the third quarter of the nineteenth century. The markers speak towards the high frequency of childhood death, as demonstrated by the dual markers for the two sons of Levi and Lucinda Rice, aged four and six, who both died on the same day in December 1817, while also demonstrating for families longevity, such as Ananias Cooke, who died in 1851 at the age of 91. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 as a site "that associated with events that have made significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history" and "that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction,"

Open Air Laboratories Network (OPAL)

The Open Air Laboratories Network (OPAL) is a partnership initiative throughout England that aims to get the public more involved with nature through a range of local and national projects. The initiative is funded by the Big Lottery Fund Changing Spaces Programme.
The portfolio of partners includes nine regional universities, the Natural History Museum, the Open University, the Field Studies Council, the Meteorological Office, the National Biodiversity Network, the Royal Parks and the Environment Agency. The lead partner is Imperial College, London.
OPAL has run seven national surveys, focusing respectively on soil, water quality, air quality, climate, biodiversity, invertebrates and tree health. By involving the public in scientific research, the project has been able to collect a large amount of data that can be used to build up a picture of England's natural environment.
Additionally, OPAL has worked to inspire the public to become more involved in nature through its national surveys, regional events, and a wide range of free resources made available through the OPAL website.
Soil and earthworm survey.
The OPAL soil and earthworm survey was launched in March 2009 by the OPAL Soil Centre at Imperial College London, supported by a number of celebrities including Steve Leonard and Chris Packham. The survey aims to learn more about soil and earthworm distribution in England and the effects that humans are having on soil quality. Members of the public are asked to upload their findings directly onto the OPAL website, and results are then analysed by the OPAL Soil Centre at Imperial College London, which is also coordinating the survey.
Air survey.
The OPAL air survey launched in September 2009 and is coordinated by Imperial College London. The survey asks people to look for lichens on trees and tar spot fungus on sycamore leaves and then record their results online. The survey is helping scientists learn more about the effects of air pollution, and is supported by a number of organisations including the British Lichen Society.
Water survey.
The OPAL water survey launched in May 2010 and is coordinated by University College London (UCL). The survey asks people to go pond-dipping and identify the invertebrates living in their local pond or lake. Using this information they can then find out how polluted the water is, as some creatures are more tolerant of pollution than others. Results are collected online and will help scientists learn more about lakes and ponds across England.
Biodiversity survey.
The OPAL biodiversity survey launched in September 2010, coordinated by the Open University (OU). The survey asks the public to investigate their hedges and look for invertebrates and other signs of wildlife. Hedges are incredibly important habitats for many creatures and the survey aims to raise awareness and learn more about life in hedges across the country.
Climate survey.
The OPAL climate survey launched in March 2011, coordinated by the Met Office. It asks people to look for contrails in the sky, estimate their thermal comfort, and measure wind using bubbles. The results are helping scientists learn more about the ways we affect our climate, and how we may adapt to it.
Bugs Count.
The Bugs Count survey launched in June 2011 and is coordinated by the Natural History Museum. It aims to collect data on bugs and other invertebrates that live all around us by asking the public to count invertebrates in timed challenges and look out for six particular bugs in the Species Quest.
The Natural History Museum also developed the free Bugs Count app for iPhone and Android.
Tree health survey.
The OPAL tree health survey launched in May 2013 in partnership with Forest Research and the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA). It aims to build a picture of the health of trees across country by asking the public to record data about the size and appearance of their tree while also looking for signs of pests and diseases. This includes six serious pests and diseases, referred to as the Most Unwanted, which are not yet established in the UK and could cause serious damage to the tree population.
This survey has also been extended to Wales and Scotland in partnership with Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Government.
The Food and Environment Agency also developed the free tree health survey app for iPhone and Android.
Community Environment Report.
In January 2013, OPAL published the Community Environment Report, summarising the findings of the first five years of the project and its contribution to citizen science.
The report showed that more than half a million people across England had been involved in OPAL activities, many of whom were carrying out a nature survey for the very first time. Their data had also provided scientists with information about locations that had not been sampled before and may not otherwise have been studied.
Projects and partners.
OPAL has comprised a total of 31 projects. These projects are listed below, together with the institution (OPAL partner) responsible for the project's delivery.

Akersbanerne

A/S Akersbanerne was a municipal owned company that operated tramways in the former Municipality of Aker in current Oslo, Norway. The company was established in 1917, and opened the suburban Østensjø Line tramway in 1926; it took over the majority ownership of Holmenkolbanen in 1933, that owned the Holmenkoll Line, Sognsvann Line and the Røa Line. Akersbanerne merged with Oslo Sporveier in 1949, following the merger of the municipalities.
History.
The company was founded on 7 June 1917 to coordinate the construction of new suburban tramways from Kristiania (now Oslo) to the new suburbs in Aker. The company planned to build several lines from the end of the street tramways in the city, and extend them on grade-separated right-of-way. The first project was the Østensjø Line; with construction starting in 1922 it opened from Vålerenga to Bryn on 18 December 1923 and to Oppsal on 10 January 1926. For the first three years street trams operated by Kristiania Sporveisselskab went the 1.5 km route to Bryn, but after the full line opened, Akersbanerne could never reach agreement with Oslo Sporveier, and not until 1937 did they run trams into the city center.
Also in 1922 the company started building the Sognsvann Line, and in 1924 it bough the Smestad Line from A/S Holmenkolbanen. In 1928 the Sognsvann Line and the Holmenkoll Line were extended from Majorstuen to Nationaltheatret, but the builder A/S Holmenkolbanen had acquired so much debt in the process that they on 16 November 1933 were forced to save the company by merging the Sognsvann and Smestad Line into Akersbanerne—giving the latter a majority ownership stake in the former. From 4 January 1937 Bærumsbanen took over the operation of trams on the Østensjø Line, though the ownership of the line remained with Akersbanerne.
On 1 January 1948 the municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged, and on 31 May 1949 the two municipal owned companies merged, taking the name of Oslo Sporveier.

"For the Welsh rugby union player see Ross Jones (rugby player)"
Ross A. Jones (born January 14, 1960) is a former Major League Baseball shortstop. Jones was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers ninth overall in the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft. He played college baseball at the University of Miami.
After four seasons in the Dodgers' farm system, Jones was traded with Sid Fernandez to the New York Mets for Bob Bailor and Carlos Diaz. He made the team out of Spring training , but saw only limited action behind Jose Oquendo and Ron Gardenhire at short, and was used primarily as a pinch hitter or pinch runner. In thirteen plate appearances, he had a double and three walks. The double was a game winning walk-off hit against Al Holland and the Philadelphia Phillies on April 28. On May 13, in one of his few appearances on the field with the Mets, Jones committed an error that led to three unearned runs in the Mets 5-3 loss to the Dodgers. He was reassigned to their triple A affiliate, the Tidewater Tides shortly afterwards, and briefly reappeared with the Mets following the All-Star break.
Jones split between Tidewater and the double A Jackson Mets, and batted only .192 combined. Following the season, he was released, and signed with the Seattle Mariners.
Jones played at three levels for the Mariners in , one of which was the major leagues. Despite batting .290 in the minors, with Seattle, he had only one hit in 21 at-bats for a .095 batting average. 
Batting .319 with the Pacific Coast League's Calgary Cannons in , Jones was traded to the Kansas City Royals for a player to be named later. He continued to hit well for the Omaha Royals, and earned a promotion to Kansas City. In 39 games, Jones batted .254, and had ten of his eleven career RBIs.
Following the season, Jones signed with the Oakland Athletics, but after committing four errors in three games with the triple A Tacoma Tigers, and getting only two hits in eighteen at bats, he was released. He signed with the New York Yankees shortly afterwards, spending the rest of the season with their triple A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers, before retiring.

History.
The Norwich Pharmaceutical Company was established in Norwich, New York, in 1887. In 1893, Norwich introduced Unguentine to the medical profession as the first antiseptic surgical dressing. The company’s mixture called Cholera Infantum, later renamed Pepto-Bismol, appeared for the first time in 1901. Its principal use was for infants with severe diarrhea. In 1907, Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) tablets were added to the company’s product line. In 1939, Norwich Pharmaceutical stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. During World War II, the company earned the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award with four added stars in recognition of its support of the troops and war effort. In 1982, the company, then called Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Procter & Gamble Company. In the mid-1990s, Norwich constructed an Intermediate Potency solid dose form facility, from which the osteoporosis drug Actonel was launched. The Norwich, NY, plant was purchased from Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals in 2001 and transitioned into its current role as an outsourcing provider to the pharmaceutical industry. A long-term contract was signed with Procter & Gamble, which remains in force today.

Aurora (tone poem)

Aurora is an orchestral tone poem by William Lloyd Webber which is acknowledged to be among the composer's finest works. Written in 1948, it lay unperformed for many years. When a recording was issued in 1986 the Guardian newspaper's reviewer, Edward Greenfield, described the work as: " Music as sensuous as any you will find by a British composer". William Lloyd Webber himself had this to say in a programme note about "Aurora":
“Arriving from the East in a chariot of winged horses, dispelling night and dispersing the dews of the morning. Aurora was the Roman Goddess of the dawn. This short tone poem attempts to portray in reasonably respectable sonata first movement form, the inherent sensuality of her nature. 
Consecutive 6/4 chords introduce a bit of night music soon to be dispelled by the dawn theme, announced by the flute. Aurora’s theme forms the second subject and (it is hoped) is of a suitably lyrical nature, as befits such a beautiful goddess. Her amorous adventures can possibly be imagined in the development section, and in the recapitulation her theme occurs twice – the first time with a light textured orchestration, and then with all the instruments that were available at the time of writing the piece.
At the moment of climax, the night music returns again, and Aurora has to leave us. However the final cadence has a hint of her theme, and there is always the promise of a new day.”

Garuda Indonesia Flight 865

Garuda Indonesia Flight 865 was a scheduled international flight from Fukuoka, Japan, to Jakarta, Indonesia that crashed at takeoff on 13 June 1996.
The crew of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, attempted to abort take-off after the failure of the number 3 (right) engine. The abort occurred at speeds nearing V2, and after rotation of the nose. Following the abort, attempts were made to stop the aircraft on the runway by use of brakes, ground spoilers and thrust reversers, but the crew was unable to stop the aircraft within the boundaries of the runway, which exited the airport property.
In slowing down, the aircraft slid through a ditch, a fence and a road before finally coming to rest approximately beyond the runway threshold. Damage done to the aircraft during the slide across the ground caused the landing gear to break off, and both wing mounted engines to be torn off from the wings. The fuselage broke in two places, at about the wing root trailing edge, and at approximately aft of the wing root trailing edge. The resultant fire destroyed the areas between the hull fractures, and other areas of the aircraft.
The failure of the engine was attributed to a failed turbine blade that had been in use for 6182 cycles. General Electric, the manufacturer of the engine, had advised customers to discard turbine blades after 6000 cycles.

Amarnath land transfer controversy

On 26 May 2008, the government of India and state government of Jammu and Kashmir reached an agreement to transfer of forest land to the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) in the main Kashmir valley to set up temporary shelters and facilities for Hindu pilgrims. This caused a controversy, with demonstrations from the Kashmir valley against the land transfer and protests from the Jammu region supporting it. The largest demonstration saw more than 500,000 protesters at a single rally, among the largest in Kashmir's history.
Kashmir protests.
Six people were killed and 100 injured when police fired into a crowd in Srinagar protesting the transfer of forest land. Separatist JKLF (R) organised a march to the controversial land in Baltal. Senior separatist leaders Shabir Ahmad Shah, Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), which planned the protests, were placed under house arrest. Throughout the Srinagar area, most public buildings, including schools and government offices, and many businesses, have remained closed.
Environmental concerns.
Initial opposition to the land transfer was based on environmental concerns. Some environmentalists argued that the land transfer would hamper the region's delicate ecological balance. However, hundreds of acres of forested land were destroyed for the construction of a road linking Poonch to Rajouri.
Reports that the SASB was planning to construct dams across the river Indus to generate electricity for the shrine were unconfirmed.
Government response.
The state government accepted the demands of the protesters from the Kashmir valley region by revoking the land transfer decision on 1 July 2008. Hindu groups in the Jammu region reacted by mounting their own counter-protests against the revocation and called for the cancellation of the revocation decision.
Political turmoil.
As the Kashmiri protests grew wider and more violent, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) said that it would withdraw support to the Indian National Congress (INC)-led state government if it did not revoke the land transfer agreement. 
Though the land transfer was revoked (after the PDP withdrew its support), the crisis deepened further when the PDP didn't lend support to the state government even after the revocation. Meanwhile, the Gulam Nabi Azad's minority government decided to step-down on 7 July 2008.
The protests, however, took a more political tone as state elections are scheduled to be held later in 2008. With elections already due in the state, Omar Abdullah played down the incident and said that PDP's decision to withdraw was not a major constitutional crisis.
Jammu protests.
In Jammu, mass protests erupted against the government's decision to revoke the land transfer. The people of the Jammu region generally supported the land transfer, and threatened to shut down the city on 26 June 2008. 20 kilometres away, in Nagrota, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters blocked a highway 
It has been joined by 35 other organisations, under the banner of Amarnath Shrine Sangharsh Samiti, that have two main demands: that of recalling Governor NN Vohra and the restoration of land to the Shrine Board.
Hindu groups such as the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) protested in front of Kashmir House in Delhi in support of the land transfer. The situation in Jammu suddenly deteriorated after Kuldeep Raj committed suicide on 23 July and his body was mishandled and dishonoured by the police. Slowly, protests spread to other parts of Jammu. A curfew was imposed in many districts. Protesters claimed that an economic blockade of the Kashmir Valley was being imposed by stopping traffic on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway. The "economic blockade" theory was however fiercely contested, with the Government of India, the Army, the District Administration, SASB maintaining that there was no blockade. BJP called the blockade "a lie perpetuated by the ISI", of which there was no compelling evidence, and maintained the people of the Valley were being misled with a false propaganda, aiding the designs of separatists. One person was killed and another injured on 6 August 2008 when the Army fired to disperse a violent mob, which blocked the Jammu-Pathankot Highway in Kathua district. Two protesters were killed and eight injured as police opened fire to quell a mob in Samba district on 1 August 2008 Conversely there were also Muslims who, backed by the local Muslim federation and the Muslim Gujjar community, who supported the demands of the Hindus of Jammu. There were, however, reports of Hindu rioters in Jammu attacking and burning at least 72 Muslim homes during the weeks of violent protests.
Shri Amarnath Yatra Sangharsh Samiti convener Leela Karan Sharma said on 6 August 2008 that nothing short of revocation of the land transfer to Amarnath Shrine Board would be acceptable. He opined that the state government was responsible for flaring religious sentiments by allowing construction of the Muslim Jama Masjid at Baltal, yet not allowing a temporary structure for the benefit of Hindu yatris.
Government response.
Despite the protests, the state government has not annulled the revocation decision. Central Government moved hundreds of security forces into the region. Indian authorities restored the Amarnath pilgrimage route after a brief disruption. Opposition party BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said on 2 August 2008 that “It seems the Centre only understands the voices of the valley and not of the Jammu region. It is trying to find a solution through force and is not initiating a dialogue”. The prime minister Manmohan Singh spoke to BJP president Rajnath Singh and sought his party’s help in finding a solution to the issue.
Regional biases.
The protests highlighted the eclipse of secularism in the state of Jammu and Kashmir It also highlighted widespread frustration among both Hindus and Muslims in Jammu with the appeasement of separatists in the Kashmir valley. The separatist-Muslim dominated north west (Kashmir valley), not ready to provide land for Amarnath yatris, succeeded in revoking the land transfer through violent protests. Jammu's Hindu and Muslim nationalists in the south west (Jammu) are equally opposed to the appeasement decision to revoke the land transfer. Thus, a regional divide emerged between Jammu and Kashmir., while eastern Ladakh remains aloof.
The Gujjar Muslim community strongly attacked the statement of separatist leaders that Muslims in Jammu do not want to live with Hindus of the region. They described it as "an attempt to drive a wedge between communities bonded with each other by language and culture for centuries".
Peace appeal.
In a joint appeal for peace and normalcy, as many as 36 political parties—the two main formations United Progressive Alliance and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and almost every regional party represented in Parliament—underlined that “communalisation of the situation should be prevented at all cost as this would adversely impact on the secular fabric of the nation.”
Fruit grower's protests.
Kashmir Fruit Growers Association gave a 24-hour ultimatum to the government failing which they would start agitation for the opening of Muzaffarabad Road for export. “We will export our products to various Indian states via Muzaffarabad and Wagah border,” said president of the association. The Indian government alleges that the claims of an economic blockade were fabricated by the Hurriyat and the Inter-Services Intelligence to provoke locals into joining the pro-independence protests. The Ex-Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil, appealed to the fruit growers to call off their protests. He offered to buy all their fruit and also to pay compensation to those whose fruit has perished.
Party wise stand.
Congress Working Committee spokesperson, Veerappa Moily, said "Providing makeshift and temporary accommodation for yatris and pilgrims all over the country is not a new phenomenon... the authorities spend a lot of money in providing temporary facilities during Kumbh Mela, Puri rath yatra festival". said that it was absurd to suggest all such temporary shelters could be made permanent. Moily said that the Hurriyat factions and other separatist groups had exploited the mood during the turmoil to revive their "diabolic agenda". He said that playing mischief, Hurriyat had spread rumours that the highways from the Valley to the plains had been blocked stopping movement of goods and essential commodities. Making use of this false propaganda, they organised the march to Muzaffarabad to seek market for the fruit, Moily said.
Ignoring the Indian government's curfew orders, People’s Democratic Party and Kashmiri separatist leaders. backed the local fruit growers
Government position.
Claiming that there is no blockade along the Srinagar-Jammu highway, the ministry said as many as 236 trucks and tankers carrying oil, gas, sheep, medicines and poultry products crossed the Jawahar Tunnel from the Jammu side early on Wednesday morning. Of these, 82 trucks and tankers had reached Srinagar by afternoon, it said. Referring to the stranded trucks in the Valley, an official said a fleet of them actually belonged to one individual close to the Hurriyat. The transporter refused to move his vehicles towards Jammu despite the promise of full security cover along the route. The Kashmiri media, however, reported shortages of food, drugs, and other essential supplies in the Kashmir Valley as a result of the alleged blockade.

On 11 August 2008, 50,000 to 2,50,000 Kashmiri protesters attempted to cross the LoC to Muzaffarabad, in violation of march ban orders. Despite intelligence warnings that the LoC march would gather tens of thousands of supporters, the State government and top police officials failed to act immediately and refused to impose a curfew. In the event, small groups of police personnel were left to hold back the marchers.
11 August violence.
Fifteen people were killed and hundreds more injured when police and paramilitary forces opened fire on protesters attempting to cross the LoC.
All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz, a moderate separatist, was among those killed on 11 August. Police say several of their personnel were injured by stones thrown by those at the protest.
12 August violence.
Following the death of the APHC separatist leader Sheikh Abdul Aziz and others during the police firing on 11 August, the separatists in Kashmir region organized protests. Fifteen Kashmiri civilians were killed in the firing by Kashmir police and paramilitary forces. More than 100 people were also injured in a twelve separate incidents of police firing across the Kashmir valley region. Six protesters were killed in Srinagar police firing. In Lasjan, on the outskirts of Srinagar, four were killed after police forces opened fire on a protest led by former government minister Javed Mustafa Mir. Police sources claim that the service weapon of one of Mir's personal security guards "accidentally" went off, injuring 7 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers, and provoking the retaliatory firing that left four protesters dead. However, local villagers claimed that the CRPF forces opened fire on the protesters first, killing two, then opening once more when others went to help the injured, killing two women in the process. Three protesters, including a woman, were killed in firing at Paribal by the Indian Army. The army spokesperson for the 15 Corps said that the protesters were throwing stones at a military picket, and refused to disperse despite repeated appeals. Another protester was reportedly killed in Anantnag. In Kishawar, communal clashes broke out after Kashmiri Muslims began protesting the death of Sheikh Abdul Aziz. Muslim and Hindu owned homes and businesses were torched, and two protesters, including a 12-year old boy, were killed in the rioting. The burial of Sheikh Aziz, held in the Martyrs Graveyard in Srinagar, passed without incident.
14 August Jammu death.
In Jammu, a man named Balwant Raj Sharma poisoned himself. He donated all his property to Shree Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti.
20 August protests in Jammu and Kashmir.
The peaceful demonstrations in this otherwise bustling Jammu city was in stark contrast to the high decibel protests in Srinagar. While in Jammu, women walked silently with candles in their hands demanding restoration of forestland to Shri Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB), in Srinagar, they joined their protesting men against perceived injustices. Shri Aamarnath Yatra Sangarsh Samiti spearheading the agitation in Jammu, called for civil disobedience On the third and final day of the "Jail Bharo Andolan" of Shri Amarnath Yatra Sangharsh Samiti (SAYSS), over 2,00,000 protesters, including thousands of children, courted arrest in the Jammu region on 20 August 2008 .In the violent protests and clashes between the protesters and security forces, which continued till late evening, one person was killed while over 60 people, including 6 police personnel, sustained injuries.
Meanwhile, National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan reviewed the security and political situation in Jammu and Kashmir at a meeting with Governor N.N. Vohra. The government has also pushed Track-II activists into a dialogue process with the separatists even as a four-member panel was scheduled to talk with the Shri Amarnath Sangarsh Samiti.
End to SASB agitation.
On 31 August 2008, the 61-day old agitation in the Jammu region over the Amarnath land row ended following the signing of an agreement between the group leading the agitation and the Jammu and Kashmir Governor-appointed panel. Under the terms of the agreement the shrine board would be making temporary use of 40-hectares of land during the relevant yatra period. The SASB convenor Leela Karan Sharma said: "We have suspended the agitation for the time being not called it off, as some of our demands are yet to be met."

Johanna Brandt

Johanna Brandt (18 November 1876 in Heidelberg / Transvaal – 13 January 1964 in Nuweland) was a South African propagandist of Afrikaner nationalism, spy during the Boer War, prophet and writer on controversial health subjects.
Biography.
Johanna van Warmelo was born on the 18 November 1876, to Pastor Nicolaas Jacobus van Warmelo and his second wife Maria Magdalena Elizabeth Maré. Her father was a Dutch Reformed minister from the Netherlands whilst her mother's family had been early emigrants to southern Africa.
Brandt was educated for two years at the Good Hope Seminary for Young Ladies in Cape Town. When her father died in 1892, Johanna and her mother set out for a six-month tour of Europe.
At the start of the Second Boer War in 1899, Johanna volunteered along with three of her brothers. She served as a nurse until the British captured Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal. The Boers did not immediately surrender, however, and a long guerrilla war began.
It was during this second phase of the Boer War that Brandt, who was living in Pretoria, became active for the Boer cause. She organised women to spy on British officers and hid prisoners who were on the run. It was her actions that led to W.T.Stead running an article in the "Review of Reviews" about the appalling conditions in the Irene Concentration Camp, which contributed to a decline in British public support for the war.
After the war she wrote her own account of the Irene Concentration Camp, but her most well-known book was "The Petticoat Commando", which told of her and her mother's exploits during the Boer War. The book is dedicated to her mother, "As a peace offering for having brought her into publicity in direct opposition to her wishes". The Van Warmelos' house, which they called "Harmony" became a centre for the British occupying force. Johanna (who calls herself "Hansie" in the book) is shown as headstrong, and she and her mother exploit the British estimation of the two Boer women as harmless.
Among the high-ranking British officers quartered nearby included Lord Kitchener, Lord Roberts and the Duke of Westminster.
The Van Warmelos were largely left in peace by their "guests". This misplaced trust may have been due to Johanna's brother-in-law, Henry Cloete, who was married to her oldest sister. Cloete was a former British agent in South Africa and had been appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George by Queen Victoria. In their role of harmless civilians, Johanna and her mother were able to collect information on the movements of soldiers and ammunition, and they smuggled this information out using letters written in invisible ink made from lemon juice. 
In 1902 Johanna married a minister, Louis Ernst Brandt. She had become so well known that messages of congratulations came from the leaders of countries.
World War I.
Brandt remained involved in South African nationalist politics. When the British declared war on Germany in August 1914, they transferred the garrison in South Africa to the European front. Several Boer officers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Manie Maritz, seized this opportunity to declare South Africa's independence. When the Maritz Rebellion was crushed by the South African government 6 months later, the Nasionale Vroueparty, or National Women's Party, was formed in the Transvaal. Its purpose was to work to free the rebels and to care for their families, as well as to serve as an auxiliary for the National Party. Brandt served as secretary at the party's first congress, held in Johannesburg.
Health writings.
Brandt published about twenty pamphlets on the subject of natural remedies for health problems. Her best-known publications are "The Grape Cure" and "Fasting Book". "The Grape Cure" is said to have been written after Brandt cured herself of stomach cancer. The book may have been inspired by the writings of Arnold Ehret, a contemporary, who taught a "Grape Cure" course, according to Sylvia Saltman. The conclusions expressed by Brandt in "The Grape Cure" have been denounced as "quackery", however, Brandt's book was an influence for South African author, Essie Honiball, who wrote "I Live On Fruit", and Basil Shackleton, author of "The Grape Cure: A Personal Testament".
Prophesy.
Brandt wrote about revelations that were made to her on the evening of her mother's death on 7 December 1917 in Pretoria. She published these prophetic revelations in a book called "The Millennium" in 1918. Her other religious work was the "Paraclets, or Coming Home Mother" which was published in 1936. The works include prophecies for South Africa in which she warns the "tribes" that they must heed their "masters" and of a "dark future". After an alleged angel's revelation in 1916, Brandt is reported to have spoken of South Africans as the chosen race and of Johannesburg being attacked by black people.
Legacy.
In 2000, the South African Post office created a series of stamps about the writers of the Boer War, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Winston Churchill. Johanna Brandt appears on the 1.30 Rand stamp together with Sol Plaatje and the Anglo-Boer War Medal.

EcoJet concept car

The EcoJet concept car is a concept car designed to run on biodiesel fuel, using a Honeywell LTS101 gas turbine instead of a piston engine. The engine is normally used in helicopters and provides 650 horsepower and 583lb-ft of torque. Drive is to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transaxle adapted from a C5 Corvette. An automatic had to be used because the turbine requires a constant load and operating a clutch with a manual gearbox would cause the turbine to overspeed.
This concept car was the result of a collaboration between Jay Leno and General Motors. Unlike other concept cars, which are built mostly for show purposes, it was meant to be driven on the road in a regular fashion as well as for show purposes. 
It is a two-seater car of a coupe design. The car contains two separate gas tanks; one contains the main fuel, a biodiesel soy bean oil, and the other contains a traditional clean burning jet engine fuel - Jet A. The Jet fuel is used to start the turbine easily at the beginning of a trip and also to run the engine at the end of a trip to clean it since a biodiesel fuel tends to gum up a turbine (causing it to seize) if the biofuel is not cleared. The exhaust air is 1000 degrees Fahrenheit in normal operation and 1800 Fahrenheit at full power. Basically the car runs on refined cooking oil and so it gives off the same kind of smell created by cooking French fries.
The car has a fully featured Azentek PC running Microsoft Windows Vista, with two LCD screens on the dashboard, one for the aircraft style digital gauges and another for the media and navigation controls as well as the standard PC functions such as word processing and Web access through a Wimax system. Two other smaller LCD screens are placed on the dashboard to provide rear views, as the car has no rear view mirrors and uses cameras instead. The functions are controlled by Touchscreen or by Speech recognition software using a multiple microphone array. The car was assembled by the Big Dog crew (mechanics employed by Jay Leno, usually to help him maintain his large collection of cars).

Biography.
Shmarya Yehuda-Leib Yankelevich Medalia was born to a family of Lubavitcher hasidim. He is an alumnus of the original Slabodka yeshiva.
Between 1899-1903, he served as the rabbi of Tula, Russia; and between 1905-1917, in Vitebsk. In 1910 participated in the All-Russian Rabbinic Congress. In 1912, took part in the Agudat Israel congress in Katowice, Poland. Between 1927-1931, again served in Tula. In 1933, received the appointment ot serve as the rabbi of the Choral Synagogue in Moscow. In 1938, he was accused in court of communicating with Lubavitcher rebbe Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, and with German agents, also with corrupting the youth. Upon conviction, he was shot and buried in the common tomb in the Kommunarka proving ground. 
He was posthumously exonerated in 20 years. In 1991, rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt, who held a post of the rabbi of Moscow in 1991, presented the Choral Synagogue with a parokhet or ark curtain, in memory of Rabbi Medalia.

Phineas Upham House

The Phineas Upham House is a historic First Period house at 255 Upham Street in Melrose, Massachusetts. The house's construction date is claimed by some local historians to be c. 1703, not long after Phineas Upham married. However, other evidence suggests that this house was actually built by Phineas Upham for his son Amos, and would thus date to the late 1730s instead. The house is a 2.5 story timber frame house, three bays wide and two deep, with an off-center entrance and a a centered chimney. It probably began as a simple two-bay house and was extended later in the 18th century with the addition of the third bay. The rear of the house was also originally a single story (giving the house a saltbox appearance), but the roof was raised to a full two stories in the late 18th/early 19th century.
The house remained in Upham family hands until the early 20th century. Its last occupant moved out in 1907, and in 1913 it was purchased by the Melrose Historical Society and restored. The Upham Family Association assumed ownership of the property in 1940, and open it to the public two days each year.
The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

<doc id="18771020" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18771020" title="Arteriograph">
Arteriograph

The TensioClinic Arteriograph is a diagnostic medical device, which can measure the effects of the classical cardiovascular risk factors (age, blood pressure, cholesterol level etc.) on the level of the individual. Prevention of stroke, heart attack, peripheral vascular disease can be achieved with the early detection of atherosclerosis. Making arterial stiffness parameters available for the primary care will make cardiovascular risk stratification more accurate.
Measuring arterial stiffness has become important regarding the latest ESC & ESH Guidelines. Until now, measured arterial stiffness parameters have been measured with the conventional Doppler method. Also it has recently been proved that central blood pressure has more significant predictive value on the therapy of cardiovascular diseases than the classical, brachial one (ASCOT-CAFE).
The new technology TensioClinic Arteriograph is the first evidence based medicine diagnostic device, which reportedly measures internationally accepted arterial stiffness parameters (Pulse Wave Velocity and Augmentation Index) together with central and peripheral blood pressure in a 3-minute session. The measurement itself looks like a regular blood pressure measurement, only the cuff needs to be inflated a couple of times in a single session.
PWV is the extent of bloodstream velocity and thus that of the rigidity of the vessel wall (aorta) as well, while AIX shows the extent of the resistance against which the heart has to pump. The narrower the vessels are (especially the smaller ones), the higher the resistance is, and the higher the afterload of the heart is. The resistance of those small vessels is determined primarily by the damage on the inner wall (so-called endothelial damage). Since the process of arteriosclerosis usually begins with endothelial damage, early measurement can only recognize higher AIX (often combined with slightly higher blood pressure). Later on, when the vessels are actually narrower and more rigid (sclerosis), this becomes visible from a higher PWV.
The device uses the results of medical researches, which showed that signals could be detected from the upper arm cuff, even if it is over-inflated with beyond the systolic BP, despite the completely closed brachial artery. Although these signals are extremely small, it is possible to detect them. It had been revealed that they contain information about the central hemodynamics. EU references are available for reinforcing the significance of this device, which can also evaluate the efficiency of applied cardiovascular therapy and for follow up of diabetic patients.
The measurement is based on the fact that during systole, the blood volume having been ejected into the aorta generates pulse wave (early systolic peak). This pulse wave runs down and reflects from the bifurcation of aorta, creating a second wave (late systolic peak). The return time (RT S35) is the difference (ms) between the first and the reflected systolic wave. RT S35 is related to the stiffness of the aorta. The difference of the amplitudes of the first and second systolic wave (AIx) depends on the tone of the peripheral arteries (endothel function). On the basis of these, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV S35) can be calculated if the distance between the jugulum and the symphysis (Jug-Sy) is measured.
By analysing the amplitude of the reflected and the first wave, the Augmentation Index can be calculated (Aix), providing information on both the stiffness of the aorta (arteriosclerosis) and about the peripheral vascular tone. The closing of the aortic valve can be recognised on the wave taken at the systolic pressure + , and as a result the ejection duration (ED) can be measured. By using the ED, the systolic (SAI) and diastolic area (DAI) can be calculated on the oscillometric pulse wave, recorded at diastolic pressure. SAI and DAI are in a close relation to the coronary perfusion, because it is mainly maintained in diastole.
Increased and abnormal arterial stiffness is the early sign of arteriosclerosis. The arterial stiffness is calculated from the above parameters, resulting in a classification of optimal, normal, increased or abnormal values. The measurement takes only three minutes. TensioClinic Arteriograph provides a screening method that detects arteriosclerosis in its early stage, when pathological procedures still could be positively influenced.
The Arteriograph needs to be wirelessly connected to a PC, having software installed that evaluates the measurement. The export version of the software makes the recorded data available in an Excel sheet. This makes the method a tool for the research of hemodynamic parameters.
In addition to the above parameters, blood pressure on the upper arm and aortic blood pressure are also measured. The latter is especially important with respect to the ‘workload’ of the heart.
The Arteriograph measures the following parameters in the same 3-min session:
- Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Sys, Dia) 
- Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
- Pulse pressure (PP) 
- Heart rate (HR)
- Augmentation index (Aix)
- Systolic blood pressure on the aorta (SBPao)
- Return time (RT S35)
- Pulse wave velocity in the aorta (PWV S35)
- Left ventricle ejection duration (ED)
- Systolic area index (SAI)
- Diastolic area index (DAI)

David J. R. Frakt

David Frakt is an American lawyer, law Professor, and officer in the United States Air Force Reserve.
Education.
Frakt is a 1987 graduate of the University High School, Irvine, California and a 1990 graduate of the University of California, Irvine and a 1994 honors graduate of Harvard Law School.
Career.
Frakt is notable for his appointment to defend Guantanamo detainee Mohammed Jawad, an alleged combatant facing charges for events that took place when he was a minor. Jawad is one of two detainees, along with Omar Khadr, to be prosecuted for acts they allegedly committed while juveniles. Frakt also represents another Guantanamo detainee facing trial by military commission, Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, the alleged Al Qaida propaganda chief from Yemen. Frakt has recently been promoted by the U.S. Air Force Reserve JAG Corps to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In August 2010, he will join the faculty of the Barry University Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law in Orlando, Florida.
Challenged Brigadier Thomas Hartmann's role.
On June 19, 2008 Frakt challenged the role of Brigadier General Thomas W. Hartmann in choosing his client Mohammed Jawad for trial.
Frakt argued that Hartmann had ""...exercised unlawful command influence.""
Hartmann had been appointed the legal advisor to the convening authority—the number two in the Office of Military Commissions, in the summer of 2007, and had immediately overrode the decisions of Colonel Morris Davis, who was then the Chief Prosecutor, when Davis was on leave.
Hartmann was widely quoted as saying the Prosecution should choose to charge captives based on whether their trials would: ""...capture the imagination of the American people.""
In May 2008 Captain Keith Allred, the Presiding Officer of Salim Ahmed Hamdan's Military Commission, ruled that Hartmann could no longer play any role in Hamdan's Commission process because of the appearance of impropriety shown by his participation to date.
Frakt argued to Colonel Stephen R. Henley, the Presiding Officer of Jawad's military commission, that Hartmann should be barred from any further participation in Jawad's Prosecution because of his exercise of "unlawful command interference."
The June 19, 2008, hearing where Frakt challenged Hartmann's participation and argued for dismissal of the charges based on torture and outrageous government conduct lasted 14 hours.
According to Carol Rosenberg, of the "Miami Herald", Frakt argued that Jawad had been subjected to: ""...pointless and sadistic treatment a bleak underworld of barbarism and cruelty, of anything goes, of torture."" Frakt's closing argument has been widely praised in the media. Jamil Dakwar, Director of the Human Rights Program for the ACLU called the argument “an historic closing argument that should be taught in every military academy across the country.”
Deborah Colson, of Human Rights First, in a report in the Huffington Post, called the argument a “most powerful indictment of Bush administration policies.” 
Michael Winship, of Bill Moyer’s Journal, called the argument “an unusual and especially fine expression of American patriotism.”
Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Anthony Lewis described the argument as “a remarkable display of legal and moral courage.”
Frakt also argued, during his challenge of Hartmann's unlawful influence, that the Prosecution had failed to release important records to the Defense, and that this showed that the process through which Jawad was charged was rushed and without proper preparation.
On August 14, 2008 Henley barred Hartmann from future participation in Mohammed Jawad's commission.
According to Mike Melia, writing for the "Associated Press", Henley ruled that Hartmann: ""...compromised his objectivity in public statements aligning himself with prosecutors and defending the Pentagon's system for prosecuting alleged terrorists."
However, Henley chose not to dismiss the charges against Jawad because of Hartmann's controversial conduct. He did rule that Frakt was authorized to submit arguments for dropping the charges against Jawad directly to Susan J. Crawford, the Convening Authority, as to whether charges against Jawad were justified. On September 12, Hartmann was removed from his position as Legal Advisor, and three days later Frakt submitted a plea to the Convening Authority to dismiss the charges, which included matters in mitigation and extenuation, legal arguments, and letters and a petition from concerned citizens. On September 23, Crawford rejected this appeal and reaffirmed her earlier decision to refer charges against Mohammad Jawad to trial.
Comments on Frakt's efforts to have the charges against Jawad dismissed due to abusive conduct, including the "frequent flyer program".
In June 2008, prosecutor Lt Col Darrel Vandeveld turned over detention records which had been previously withheld to the defense. These records demonstrated that Mohammed Jawad had been subjected to the controversial "frequent flyer program" a euphemistic term used by Guantanamo detention officials to describe a frequent cell movement program which resulted in sleep disruption and deprivation. These records were made available to Frakt shortly before Mohammed Jawad's first hearing before his Military Commission.
Based on these records, Frakt sought to have the charges against Jawad dismissed on the grounds of torture and "outrageous government conduct." Frakt reported at Jawad's June 19, 2008 Commission hearing that those records showed that Jawad had been moved 112 times in a two-week period in May 2004. Following previous inquiries into abusive treatment of detainees, this technique had reportedly been ordered discontinued two months prior to its use on Jawad by the then Commanding Officer of JTF-Guantanamo, Brig Gen Jay Hood.
On July 11, 2008, in another filing submitted to the Military Commission Frakt reported that the Prosecution had withheld evidence of the medical effects on his client of the two weeks of sleep deprivation.
Frakt reported that Jawad's medical records, which had only recently been made available to him, contradicted the Prosecution's claims that Jawad had suffered "no ill effects" from the sleep deprivation.
Frakt reported that the medical records showed that Jawad had lost ten percent of his body weight during his sleep deprivation, and that he had told doctors he had been urinating blood.
On August 7, 2008 an article in the "Washington Post" reported that newly published documents showed that the prohibited sleep deprivation technique had been in wider use than had previously been known.
The "Washington Post" report quoted Frakt's response to the news of this violation:
Additional hearings were held on August 13–14 and September 26–27, 2008. At the August 13–14 hearing, an intelligence officer formerly stationed at Guantanamo testified that the frequent flyer program was "standard operating procedure" and was used on dozens of detainees until at least April 2005. On September 24, Col. Henley ruled that the frequent flyer program was cruel, abusive and inhumane treatment, and recommended those responsible be punished. However, he declined to dismiss the charges against Jawad, ruling that other lesser remedies were adequate to address the abuse. The next hearing is scheduled for December.
Comments on Lt Col Darrel Vandeveld's resignation.
On September 9, 2008, former lead prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Darrel Vandeveld, an Army Reserve JAG, requested to be reassigned to other duties rather than continue to serve as prosecutor on the Jawad case. On September 24, 2008 Frakt commented on Lt Col Darrel Vandeveld's recent resignation,
He said Vandeveld, whose resignation document has not yet been released: “could no longer continue to serve ethically as a prosecutor.” According to the "New York Times", Frakt said Vandeveld had been "troubled" by the orders he had been given. Frakt told the "New York Times" that Vandeveld had recommended a plea bargain and early release for Jawad, and had been overruled. Vandeveld later testified in a hearing on September 27, 2008 at Guantanamo that exculpatory evidence had been withheld from the Jawad defense, and that he had resigned because of concerns about the discovery process and his inability to determine whether all relevant discovery had been disclosed to the defense due to "systemic problems" with discovery at the Office of Military Commissions.
Mohammed Jawad's noncombatant status.
In July 2009 US District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle ruled Mohammed Jawad was a noncombatant.
On July 28, 2009 Frakt filed a motion in Mohammed's military commission following Huvelle's ruling.
He argued that the military commissions were only authorized to try illegal enemy combatants, and since he was officially a noncombatant his military commission lacked jurisdiction.
Efforts to support Mohammed Jawad's re-integration into Afghan society.
On September 21, 2009 historian Andy Worthington, author of "The Guantanamo Files", published a letter from Frakt that documented the role he and his colleagues had hoped to play in Mohammed Jawad's re-integration into Afghan society.
Frakt had argued to Susan Crawford that while civilian Defense attorney's didn't traditionally play a role in the lives of their clients, after their trials, the tradition for military Defense counsel was the opposite. Further, he argued that, as a child captive the literature strongly recommended the released captive be in the company of trusted adults—and the only trusted adults in his life recently had been his Defense counsel.
Frankt also described, at length, the significant role played by his colleagues on "Team Jawad", Commander Katharine Doxakis, Major Eric Montalvo USMCR, Captain Chris Kannady, USMC, civilian counsels Hina Shamsi, Jonathan Hafetz, Art Spitzer, military and civilian paralegals, a team of law students from Duke University, and a law student named Joe Pace, from Yale Law School.

Wolfmother discography

The discography of Wolfmother, an Australian hard rock band, consists of two studio albums, three extended plays (EPs), ten singles, and one video album. The band have also released ten music videos, and made unique contributions to two soundtrack albums and one tribute album.
Wolfmother were formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett. The band signed with Modular Recordings and released the extended play "Wolfmother" in 2004, which entered the ARIA Singles Chart at number 35. In 2005 they released their full-length debut album, also self-titled, in Australia, where it peaked at number three on the ARIA Albums Chart. The album was subsequently released in Europe by Island Records and in North America by Interscope Records in 2006. Six singles were released from "Wolfmother", the highest-charting of which was "Joker & the Thief", which reached number eight in Australia. The album went on to sell over 1.3 million copies worldwide, and has been certified five times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association, and gold in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
After a lineup change at the beginning of the year, "Back Round" was released as a free digital download in March 2009. In April it was reported that Wolfmother's second album would be released in September, although this was later pushed back to October. "New Moon Rising" was released as the lead single from the album in August, with "Back Round" only included on the deluxe editions of the album. "Cosmic Egg" was released on 23 October 2009, achieving the same Australian chart peak as "Wolfmother", as well as platinum certification status from the ARIA. In March 2010 the band released "iTunes Live from Sydney", an iTunes-exclusive live EP, featuring songs recorded at a free show at an Apple Store in Sydney the previous month.
In April 2010 Atkins left the band to focus on family commitments, and was replaced with The Mooney Suzuki drummer Will Rockwell-Scott. In 2012 the group's lineup changed again, with Rockwell-Scott and rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth departing, and the follow-up album to "Cosmic Egg" was slated for release in 2013. It was later announced, however, that the Wolfmother moniker would be retired by frontman Andrew Stockdale, who would release the group's next album as his first solo effort, "Keep Moving".

Laimbu

Laimbu (Manchu: ; 26 January 1612 - 23 June 1646) was a Manchu noble of the early Qing Dynasty.
Biography.
Laimbu was born of the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan as the 13th son of Nurhaci, founder of the Qing Dynasty. His mother was Lady Silin-Gioro (西林覺羅氏), a concubine of Nurhaci. He was a younger half-brother of Nurhaci's successor Hong Taiji.
In 1634, during Hong Taiji's reign, Laimbu was appointed as Niuluzhangjing (牛錄章京) and in 1639 he was given a position in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers. In 1642 he followed his older half-brother Ajige to attack the Ming Dynasty and defeated a Ming army at Ningyuan. Ajige returned to his residence without waiting for an announcement of the rewards granted to him by Hong Taiji in recognition of his contributions. This was seen as showing disrespect towards the emperor. Laimbu was also found guilty because he did not stop Ajige, and was stripped off his position in the Council.
In 1645 Laimbu was granted the title of "General Who Receives Grace" (奉恩將軍). He died in 1646 and his title was inherited by his son Laihu (來祜). In 1653, during the reign of the Shunzhi Emperor, Laimbu was conferred a posthumous title of "Duke Jiezhi Who Assists the Nation" (輔國介直公). The ducal title "Duke Who Assists the Nation" (輔國公) was then passed on to Laimbu's son Laihu.

Sinkha

The Sinkha Project is a series of digital comics and multimedia novels created by Marco Patrito, an Italian science-fiction author and illustrator who has published comic novels in Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Holland and North America since 1984. He has drawn more than 150 cover illustrations for Italian publisher Arnoldo Mondadori Editore.
The Sinkha Universe, originally conceived by Patrito in early 1991, was used as a set for the first "Sinkha" multimedia novel, which was completely realized using ground-breaking 3D computer graphics over the course of five years. In 1995, the '"Sinkha" CD-ROM was finally distributed by Virtual Views in Europe, USA and Japan for Mac OS and Windows operating systems.
Episodes.
As of 2008, the Sinkha Project is composed of four multimedia novels (Episodes 0, 1, 2 and 3) and three graphic novels (Episodes 1, 2 and 3). The printed versions are available in Italian, French, Portuguese and German languages. Episodes 0 and 1 were also published in English on special issues of the American magazine Heavy Metal.
Sinkha 0: First Encounter.
"Sinkha" tells the story of Hyleyn, a bold girl who lives in the mysterious city of Thalissar. This gigantic and gloomy agglomeration of howling metal, located on the hostile planet Ogon, proves to be of great interest to the Sinkha, a race of immortals who send their living starship Darcron to investigate."
Presented as the first multimedia novel completely realized in 3D computer graphics; although it was published in 1993, "Donna Matrix", by Mike Saenz, is credited as the first digital graphic novel utilizing 3D rendering. "Sinkha" was released in 1995 for Mac OS 7, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. It features 8-bit graphics and a monaural soundtrack. It specifically requires QuickTime 2 and does not work properly on recent operating systems, although it is possible to run it via emulators like Basilisk and DOSBox.
In 1998, Marco Patrito was approached by a Hollywood film producer wanting to turn "Sinkha" into a movie. Patrito was asked to draw up a "feature film treatment" based on the novel, with the addition of some variants. The draft was approved and pre-production started, but budget troubles quickly arose. A non-negotiable clause was that the movie would have to be done entirely in computer graphics, which at the time were very expensive. When the estimated figure (over twenty million dollars) was judged to be insufficient, a proposal was made to use real and affordable actors that were not overly famous, but the situation stalled. It was impossible to move beyond that impasse, and the project was ultimately abandoned.
However, in 2002, the second multimedia novel, "Hyleyn", included an abridged version of Sinkha based on the synopsis of this aborted movie. Subtitled "First Encounter", it contained fewer, but enhanced (although static) CG artworks, as well as an expanded description of the original events.
In 2008, the original "Sinkha" was remastered with 24-bit graphics and a full stereophonic soundtrack. It was re-released as "Sinkha Zero".
The music of Episode 0 was composed by the neo-prog band Fancyfluid (Sandro Bruni and Fabrizio Goria).
Sinkha 1: Hyleyn.
As an added bonus, "Hyleyn" includes an abridged version of "Sinkha" which contains fewer but enhanced (although static) CG artworks, as well as an expanded description of the original events.
The music of Episode 1 was composed by Ettore Cimpincio.
Sinkha 2: Atmosphere.
Episodes 2 and 3 were released together on a single CD-ROM. The disc contains two bonus features: an Extra section in which Marco Patrito explains the genesis of the Sinkha Project, and a second section which offers a detailed presentation of the Sinkha Universe.
The music of Episode 2 was composed by Bjørn Lynne, Nery Bauer and Jacek Dojwa.
Sinkha 3: Planet of the Clouds.
Episodes 2 and 3 were released together on a single CD-ROM. The disc contains two bonus features: an Extra section in which Marco Patrito explains the genesis of the Sinkha Project, and a second section which offers a detailed presentation of the Sinkha Universe.
The music of Episode 3 was composed by Bjørn Lynne, Nery Bauer and Jacek Dojwa.
Authoring.
The Sinkha Project was created and realized by Marco Patrito, with the collaboration of Fabio Patrito and Tullio Rolandi. Some works and suggestions were contributed by Flavio Chirico and Francesco Chirico (Episode 0), Laura Patrito, Maurizio Manzieri (all Episodes), Marco Rolandi (Episode 1), Daniele Totolo (Episodes 1 and 2) and Massimo Zuanazzi (Episode 2).

1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade

The 1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade was an infantry formation of the British Army during World War II. It was formed in 1940 from battalions of the Royal West African Frontier Force and served in the East African campaign against the Italians and against the Japanese in Burma.
History.
The 1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade was originally raised in 1940 as the 3rd (Nigerian) Brigade. In this guise it was involved in the East African Campaign against the forces of the Italian Colonial Empire in Kenya under the command of Brigadier Gerard Russell Smallwood. Later it was renamed the 23rd (Nigerian) Brigade and was attached to the 1st (African) Division. In February 1941, the 23rd (Nigerian) Brigade took the Italian Somaliland capital of Mogadishu, before it participated in the reoccupation of British Somaliland later in the year.
In 1944 the Brigade was attached to the 82nd (West Africa) Division and renamed the 1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade. In this same year it sailed for Ceylon, where the complete division was assembled on July 20. They then moved to Burma and took part in the third Arakan campaign in December 1944.
During this camapaign, the Brigade first advanced south along the Kalapanzin valley, then crossed a steep and jungle-covered mountain range to converge with the British 81st (West Africa) Division on Myohaung at the mouth of the Kaladan River. This move forced the Japanese to evacuate the Mayu peninsula which they had held for almost four years, and retreat south along the coast. They continued to advance maintaining pressure, on the Japanese capturing the port of Gwa shortly before the Japanese abandoned Burma.

The 1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade was made up of the following units:

<doc id="18771117" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18771117" title="Sudbury Aqueduct">
Sudbury Aqueduct

The Sudbury Aqueduct is an aqueduct in Massachusetts. It runs for from Farm Pond at Waverly Street in Framingham to Chestnut Hill Reservoir in Boston. Going east from Framingham, it runs through Sherborn before entering Natick. From Natick it runs east through Wellesley and Needham to the Charles River, which it crosses on the Echo Bridge into Newton. It ends at the Chestnut Hill Reservoir on the Newton side of the Newton-Boston line. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) operates the aqueduct.
Construction.
The Sudbury Aqueduct was constructed between 1875 and 1878, and was in use for almost 100 years. It was designed to carry water from the watershed of the Sudbury River to Boston and its surrounding communities. Reservoirs in Framingham and Southborough were constructed to impound this water at the time of the aqueduct's development, and additional reservoirs in Ashland and Hopkinton were constructed in the 1880s in an attempt to meet increased demand. Finally in the 1890s the Sudbury Reservoir was created in 1898, significantly increasing the amount of water available for distribution.
The aqueduct consists primarily of a horseshoe-shaped brick lining that is in diameter and high. The bricks are set in concrete atop a foundation of concrete and stone rubble. The aqueduct is covered by an arch built of brick. The aqueduct was designed to carry 80 million gallons of water per day, and is inclined one foot per mile. At a number of places on the aqueduct small buildings were built to house control equipment of various sorts. These include a gate house at Farm Pond (abandoned after a channel was constructed feeding the aqueduct from Framingham Reservoir #1 due to poor water quality at Farm Pond), a metering house in southeastern Framingham, and control houses over weirs where the aqueduct crosses over other bodies of water. These control points allow water from the aqueduct to be diverted into the watersheds it crosses. There are also control houses on either end of the Rosemary Brook siphon in Wellesley, where the water is sent through cast iron pipes to traverse an extended low spot on the route. This stretch of the aqueduct illustrates a number of the techniques used in its construction: parts of the aqueduct here are raised on an embankment, while others are in a cut, due to significant changes in local topography. Portions of the aqueduct in Natick and Newton were created by tunneling, the longest being a tunnel in Newton. In addition to the Echo Bridge, the aqueduct also passes over the "Waban Arches" bridge. Located in Wellesley near the Elm Bank Reservation, this nine-arch bridge carries the aqueduct across a valley containing Waban Brook near its mouth at the Charles River. The aqueduct formally ends at a terminal house just above the Chestnut Hill Reservoir in Newton.
Relegation to backup service.
In the 20th century the aqueduct's functions were first augmented and then replaced by the Weston Aqueduct, the Hultman Aqueduct, and the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel. The aqueduct was taken out of regular service in 1978, and now forms part of the MWRA's emergency backup systems.
It was put into emergency use on May 1, 2010 when a wide supply pipe (only seven years old) broke in Weston. Clean water was directed through alternate pipelines to bypass the break, but to provide all the water needed, but the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority supplemented the water supply by tapping the Chestnut Hill Reservoir; water from the Sudbury Reservoir was sent through the Sudbury Aqueduct to Chestnut Hill to keep that supply going. The Chestnut Hill and Sudbury water was untreated, so about 2 million residents in about 30 communities in the Boston area were under orders for about three days to disinfect tap water by boiling.
On January 18, 1990, the route, buildings and structures associated with the aqueduct were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Sudbury Aqueduct Linear District. Much of the aqueduct's route is open to the public as an unimproved walking trail.

At age 11 his family moved to Auburn, Maine, where he was influenced by the many musicians living there. Guitarists such as Lenny Breau and Jeff Wright became friends with West and helped him develop his style of playing.
In 1985 West met Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top and Gibbons suggested that West moved to Austin, Texas. After moving to there he was signed to Russell Whitaker's label Brighton Road Productions. This allowed him to record several of his albums such as 1987's "Rattlesnake" and 1994's "Blues College". Whitaker's studio, the Dallas Sound Lab, has produced many recordings and this recording contract was instrumental in exposing West's music to the world.
In 2007, West became friends with Bill Lawrence. They are concentrating on producing a documentary on Lawrence's life and career as an innovator of the electric guitar.

Hampton-Preston House

The Hampton-Preston House located at 1615 Blanding Street in Columbia, South Carolina, is a historic mansion that was the home of members of the prominent Hampton family. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 29, 1969.
Ainsley Hall, a wealthy Columbia merchant, had the house constructed in 1818. It was purchased a few years later by former War of 1812 general Wade Hampton I, a wealthy cotton planter. In turn, his son Wade Hampton II and grandson Wade Hampton III also resided in the home at various times, although ownership passed after Hampton I's death to his daughter Caroline and her husband, State Senator John S. Preston. 
During the latter part of the American Civil War, the house was used as the headquarters of Union Maj. Gen. John A. Logan during the occupation of Columbia. The South Carolina Presbyterian Institute for Young Ladies acquired the mansion in 1890.
The house is of a post-Colonial, Classical Revival style, having a broad veranda across the front with Doric columns and a fanlight above. Inside is a sweeping circular stairway with mahogany rails. A crystal chandelier hangs in the middle of the hall. The rooms are spacious, and one is adorned with a white marble mantel by the sculptor Hiram Powers. The gardens covered a city block and were known throughout the state, but have been plowed under and felled, later becoming a parking lot.
The Hampton-Preston House was restored and reopened to the public in 1970 as a museum that epitomizes the lives of the planter elite in antebellum South Carolina, and is operated by the Historic Columbia Foundation.

Antoine de Mouchy

Antoine de Mouchy (Antonius Monchiacenus Demochares) (1494 – 8 May 1574) was a French theologian and canonist, at Paris. 
A traditional explanation of the French term "mouchard", meaning police spy or informer, is that it derived from his use of intelligence-gathering networks, when working as an inquisitor. This folk-etymology was adopted by Voltaire, following François-Eudes de Mézeray. It has been plausibly contested, on the grounds that the word is found used in the fifteenth century. The derivation from "mouche" (fly) is preferred.
Life.
De Mouchy was born at Ressons-sur-Matz, near Beauvais, in Picardy. In 1539 he was appointed rector of the University of Paris. He was also professor at the Sorbonne and canon Penitentiarius of Noyon. He was one of a group of Sorbonne doctors who in the 1550s began detailed scholarship on lists of bishops, to support the apostolic succession.
As "inquisitor fidei" he exerted his influence against the Calvinists, and was a judge at the heresy trial of Anne du Bourg. In a 1560 book he accused Calvinists of sexual libertinism, practiced after the end of religious services.
In 1562 he accompanied Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine to the Council of Trent, and in 1564 was present at the Synod of Reims.
Works.
Mouchy wrote a work in defence of the Mass (Paris, 1562). His scholarly edition of the "Corpus juris canonici" is called "pioneering".

Ernest Myers

Ernest James Myers (born at Keswick 13 October 1844; died at Etchingham, Sussex, 25 November 1921), was a poet, Classicist and author. He was the second son of the Rev. Frederic Myers, author of "Catholic Thoughts", and Susan Harriett Myers (née Marshall). (His elder brother was F W H Myers, the poet, critic and psychical researcher.)
Early life.
Educated at Cheltenham and Balliol College, Oxford, (where he won the Gaisford Prize for Greek Verse in 1865), Ernest Myers became a fellow of Wadham College in 1868, teaching there for three years. In 1871, he moved to London, joining the Inner Temple and being called to the bar; however, he never practised as a barrister. Instead, he made his living as a translator and editor and also joined the committees of organisations such as the University Extension Society, the Charity Organisation Society, the Society for the Protection of Women & Children, and the Hellenic Society of which he was a founder member.
Writing.
Myers published poetry in "The Puritans" (1869), translated the "Odes" of Pindar (1874), followed in 1877 by a volume entitled "Poems". A further, larger volume of his own poetry followed in 1880, "The Defence of Rome and Other Poems", and he contributed an article on Aeschylus to a collection of Classical essays edited by Evelyn Abbott.
In 1882 he collaborated with Andrew Lang and Walter Leaf on books XVII-XXIV of Homer's "Iliad" (a companion volume to a translation of the "Odyssey"). 
Further volumes of poetry followed in the coming years: "The Judgement of Prometheus" (1886); and "Gathered Poems" (1904). He also wrote "Lord Althorp: a biography" (1890).
Family.
In London, in 1883, Myers married Nora Margaret Lodge (1858–1952) (a sister of George Edward Lodge), and they had five children. The family moved from London to Chislehurst in 1891. Their elder son - who may have been the subject of Myers’ poem "Infant Eyes" - died as a soldier in France in 1918, the last year of World War I.
Myers maintained a love of physical exercise throughout his life, including swimming, riding, lawn tennis, walking, and golf. He died on 25 November 1921 at Etchingham, Sussex, aged 77.

Richie Powling

Richie Powling (born 21 May 1956) is a former English professional footballer who played as a central defender, and who later became a manager.
Playing career.
Born in Barking, Powling began his career at Arsenal, signing on apprentice terms in September 1971. A regular for the club's reserve teams while still just fifteen, he turned professional in July 1973. He made his first-team debut in a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Queens Park Rangers on 27 October 1973, but only played once more that season; he went on to win three England youth caps during the 1973–74 season. 
A bit-part player during 1974–75, making only nine appearances, in the 1975–76 season he established himself in the first team, playing 29 matches and scored his first goal in a 1–1 draw at Coventry City's Highfield Road. However, following the arrival of a new manager, Terry Neill, and two new defenders (Pat Howard and Willie Young), as well as a series of injuries, he lost his regular place in the first team, playing just 11 times in 1976–77.
After appearing against Nottingham Forest in September 1977, he suffered an ankle injury, then knee damage, causing him to miss the rest of the 1977–78 and 1978–79 seasons. He made a comeback in the reserves at the end of 1979–80 but never fully recovered and never played for the first team again. In total he played 59 times for Arsenal, scoring three times. He left the club in 1981, signing for non-League Barnet and went on to play for Grays Athletic before retiring.
Managerial career.
He began his management career at Tiptree United in 1984, before moving to Harwich & Parkeston. Between 1992 and 1997 he managed Sudbury Town, leading them to their greatest period of success; the club were promoted to the Premier Division of the Southern League and reached the FA Cup second round for the first (and only) time in their history. 
After leaving Sudbury he took over as manager of Braintree Town in April 1999, but was sacked in December that year. After returning to Harwich on the coaching staff in 2000, he joined Clacton Town in 2002, and became the club's Director of Football in 2003.

Tryggvi the Pretender

Tryggvi "the Pretender" (Old Norse "Tryggvi Ólafsson", Norwegian "Tryggve Olavsson") was a Viking chieftain who lived in the early eleventh century, and came from "west across the sea" (probably from the Norse settlements in England and Ireland). His story appears in "Heimskringla" by Snorri Sturluson, the saga "Morkinskinna", and in "Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar" composed by Oddr Snorrason.
Invasion of Norway.
According to "Heimskringla", in 1033, during the lordship of Canute the Great's son Sveinn Alfífuson over Norway, Tryggvi invaded Norway. He claimed to be the son of Olaf Tryggvason and his wife Gyda. His enemies scoffed at this claim, asserting that Tryggvi was instead the bastard son of a priest; however, Snorri Sturluson refers to Olaf's relatives in Viken as Tryggvi's "kinsmen;" moreover, the author of "Morkinskinna" has Harald III of Norway asserting kinship with the then-deceased Tryggvi, indicating that at least some people believed Tryggvi's claim.
When word reached Sveinn Alfífuson and his mother Aelgifu of Northampton that Tryggvi's invasion was imminent, they summoned the landholders of Halogaland and the Trondheim district to join the royal army in resisting Tryggvi. The jarl Einar Tambarskjelve, angered by the policies of Canute's government, remained at home and refused to fight for Sveinn. Likewise, neither the powerful landowner Kalf Arnason nor any of his brothers would fight for Sveinn.
Sveinn Alfífuson and his forces made their way south to Agder, believing that Tryggvi would attempt to slip through the Skagerrak and join his supporters in Viken. Tryggvi, however, landed instead in Hordaland, then sailed to Rogaland to attack Sveinn's navy. The two fleets met off the island of Bokn, where only a few years before Erling Skjalgsson had been defeated and killed.
During the battle, according to reports recorded by Snorri, Tryggvi hurled javelins at his enemies with both hands simultaneously, a feat for which Olaf Tryggvason had been known. He famously exclaimed "Thus did my father teach me to say mass," simultaneously asserting his descent from King Olaf and mocking his enemies' allegation that his father was a priest. Despite his celebrated resourcefulness, Tryggvi's forces were overwhelmed by Sveinn Alfífuson's fleet and Tryggvi himself was killed.
An account preserved in "Morkinskinna" relates that Tryggvi was actually killed by a farmer after the battle. Many years later, when Harald Hardrada was king of Norway, he passed by the site of the battle. The king met an old friend of his who pointed out the alleged assassin. After questioning the purported killer and hearing him confess, King Harald had the man hanged, citing the familial bond between him and Tryggvi and his duty to avenge the latter's death.
"Heimskringla".
A famous poem, "Tryggvaflokkr", was written about Tryggvi. Excerpts of the poem, usually attributed to Canute's court poet Sighvat Thordarson, were preserved in "Heimskringla":
Another poem recorded in "Heimskringla", by an unknown skald, mentions the battle against Tryggvi:

The 1925 additions consist of a rear classroom ell and an auditorium/gymnasium addition connected to the north end of the main building by a hyphen. Originally known as the Broadway School, it was renamed in 1913 in honor of a well-liked principal. It served as a junior high school until the early 1990s, when it was closed.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is now home to an elderly assisted living facility.

Manning Manse

Manning Manse, built in 1696, is a historic house at 56 Chelmsford Road in North Billerica, Massachusetts.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
The Manning Manse was constructed in 1696 by Samuel Manning. The house is a wood frame structure, and stands on the south side of Chelmsford Road (MA Rte 129), about a quarter mile east of exit 29 from U.S. Route 3 (which connects Boston and Lowell).
The house faces south, following the style of the period in which it was built, and as a result has its back to the road. It is a two story building with a large central chimney. There are three fireplaces served by this chimney, facing three different ground floor rooms. The fourth side of this chimney is occupied by an elaborate stair leading from the entrance foyer to the second floor. There is a modern wing, extending away from the road, of only one story. The original house measured 41 feet along the road, and 31 feet from front to back. The front is a full two stories tall, with a roof which slopes sharply down to the rear (toward the road), giving the structure a kind of lean-to appearance when seen from the road. Land in the vicinity of the Manse is known as the Warren H. Manning State Forest. Warren H. Manning was a direct descendant of Samuel Manning. He was born in 1860 at Reading, Mass. In his life he became famous in New England as an authority on botanical topics, and he was a dedicated forester. In 1899 and 1900 he was instrumental in efforts to preserve the Manse, and was a founder of the Manning Association which owns the house today.
It is the place where Minutemen from New Hampshire stayed before and after the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. It was nearly destroyed by a fire in 1994. Today this tavern is rented by a private business operating a restaurant and lounge.

Middlesex Fells Reservation Parkways

The Middlesex Fells Reservation Parkways are the roadways within and bordering on the Middlesex Fells Reservation, a state park in the northern suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. The park includes portions of the towns of Malden, Medford, Melrose, Stoneham, and Winchester. The roads inside the park and around its perimeter have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other portions of some of the roads are covered by more than one listing in the national register; see Fellsway Connector Parkways and Middlesex Fells Reservoirs Historic District.
The Middlesex Fells Reservation is one of the oldest and largest of the parks in the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston. The reservation was created in 1894 with a gift of of land from The Trustees of Reservations to the Metropolitan Parks Commission, predecessor organization to the Metropolitan District Commission and today's Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). By 1897 the park had been expanded to some . This area included some existing roadways, which became internal roadways of the park. The border roads that surround the park followed a principle articulated by landscape designer Charles Eliot, who was instrumental in the preservation of the Fells, that such roads clearly delineated the bounds of the park, and provided its neighbors with pleasing views.
Border parkways.
The parkways are described here in clockwise order, beginning in the south. These roads are generally two-lane paved roads, about wide, and in some cases briefly pass through portions of the reservation.
South Border Road.
South Border Road runs from Roosevelt Circle, a major interchange including Interstate 93 and Fellsway West (Massachusetts Route 28) in Medford, along the southwestern border of the reservation, northwest into Winchester, where it ends at a junction that includes Highland Avenue, a noncontributing road that borders the reservation on the west, and the Mystic Valley Parkway, a parkway that joins the reservation to the DCR lands of the Mystic River Reservation. There are small, mostly unpaved, parking areas on the reservation side of the road providing access to trails. There is a small dead-end spur of the road that resulted from the construction of I-93, and there is a roughly section which runs inside the reservation as a result of land acquisitions south of the road.
Hillcrest Parkway.
Hillcrest Parkway is a U-shaped road, both of whose ends are on Highland Avenue in Winchester. The parkway is, at , one of the shorter parkways in the system. The west side of the parkway (the inside of the U) consists of residential properties, most of which were developed in the early 20th century; the reservation is to the east. This roadway, which does not generally carry through traffic, is only wide and is unstriped. There is a scenic view of the North Reservoir near its northern end. The Near this point there was formerly a junction with a North Border Road, which has been fragmented and rerouted in part by the construction of I-93 and partially converted to hiking trails, and is not considered part of the National Register listing.
South Street and Pond Street.
South Street runs from Main Street in Stoneham, at its junction with a newer section of North Border Road, for about east-southeast to a point where it merges into Pond Street. There is a grassy area, including a parking area, that provides fine views of Spot Pond, along this stretch of road. A non-park portion of Pond Street extends north toward the center of Stoneham, while the parkway section extends south into the interior of the park, flanking the eastern shore of Spot Pond. At its junction with Woodland Road it runs eastward to a junction with Fellsway East and the Lynn Fells Parkway, the latter a connecting parkway joining the Fells to the Breakheart Reservation. The section along the pond is four lanes wide, with opposing travel lanes separated by a wide grassy median.
Fellsway East.
The northernmost section of Fellsway East runs either within or on the border of the Fells. From the junction with Pond Street in Stoneham, it runs south, forming a small miter (triangular) junction with Ravine Road, before passing, shortly afterward entering Melrose. After it passes Washington Street, a municipal road heading southeast, it passes through a heavily wooded section of the park before reaching its junction with the East Border Road in Malden. The roadway continues south from this junction as a connecting parkway.
East Border Road.
East Border Road runs west from its junction with Summer Street, a Malden municipal street, through the intersection with Fellsway East, along the heavily wooded southern flank of the park, to a junction with Highland Avenue, a municipal street in Medford. A short stretch of Highland runs north along the park border to a circular intersection with Woodland Road and Elm Street; this stretch of Highland is not part of the National Register listing.
Elm Street.
Elm Street continues to follow the southern flank of the park westward from the junction with Woodland Road and East Border Road, running west to a junction with Fellsway West. There is a parking area, with access to Wright's Pond, on this stretch of road.
Fellsway West.
Fellsway West is partly a border parkway and partly internal; the border section of the parkway connects Elm Street to Roosevelt Circle. North of this junction only about of roadway are part of the original parkway design, having been extensively altered by the construction of I-93 along the same corridor. The internal section provides access to some centrally located reservation resources; the historic border section now consists of a one-way stretch of road that runs from the northeast side of Roosevelt Circle, while a modern one-way section runs south from the Elm Street junction, over I-93, to join Roosevelt Circle at the northwest, near the junction with South Border Road.
Interior parkways.
The interior parkways (excluding portions of the border roads that run through parts of the reservation) are described roughly from east to west.
Ravine Road.
Ravine Road is a relatively short () roadway connecting Woodland Road in the west to Fellsway East. The roadway is only wide, and is heavily forested on both sides. The ravine for which it is named contains Spot Pond Brook, and lies just to the north, but is not visible from the roadway.
Woodland Road.
Woodland Road is one of the two major north-south parkways through the reservation. It is a four-lane roadway with a grassy median for most of its length, running south from South Street in Stoneham to a junction with Elm Street and Highland Avenue in Malden. Its major intersections are designed as small rotaries, and it provides access to the Spot Pond area, the visitor center at the John Bottume House, and the Metropolitan District Commission Pumping House.
Fellsway West.
The interior reservation parkway portion of Fellsway West runs north from the junction with Elm Street in Medford to a junction with North Border Road and South Street in Stoneham. Because it has been significantly altered by the construction of adjacent I-93, most of this portion of parkway is not included in the National Register listing. The parkway provides access to the most centrally-located parking area of the reservation, the Lower Sheepfold lot.

2009 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships

The 2009 International Canoe Federation (ICF) Canoe Sprint World Championships were held 12–16 August 2009 in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, on Lake Banook. The Canadian city was selected to host the championships in October 2003 after having done so previously in 1997. Final preparations were made after the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, with competition format changed for the first time since the 2001 championships. Four exhibition events for both paddleability and women's canoe were added. Sponsorship was local within the province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax Regional Municipality. Media coverage was provided from Canada, Europe and the United States on the Internet, television and mobile phone. 669 canoeists from 68 nations participated at the championships themselves.
Germany won the most medals with 18 medals and seven golds. Men's canoe's overall winner was Russia with seven medals (one gold, five silver and one bronze). In men's kayak, the big winner was Germany with five medals (three golds, one silver and one bronze). Hungary won medals in all nine events of women's kayak. Athlete comments ranged from disgust over the format adjustment made to the canoe sprint program for the 2012 Summer Olympics to not being upset at all. Paddleability's success at these championships will hopefully push for inclusion into future Paralympic level events.
Explanation of events.
Canoe sprint competitions are broken up into Canadian canoe (C), an open canoe with a single-blade paddle, or in kayaks (K), a closed canoe with a double-bladed paddle. Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be , , or long. When a competition is listed as a C-2 500 m event as an example, it means two people are in a canoe competing at a distance.
Preliminaries to the event.
Dartmouth was awarded the 2009 championships at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Madrid, Spain, on 23 October 2003.
Event format changes.
At the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome, a new program for the championships was approved. This marked the first change in the program since the addition of the K-4 1000 m women's event at the 2001 championships in Poznań. Men's C-4 500 m, men's K-4 500 m, women's K-4 1000 m events were replaced by C-1 4 x 200 m relay (men only) and K-1 4 x 200 m relay (both men and women). Women's C-1 200 m, C-1 500 m, C-2 200 m and C-2 500 m events were shown as exhibition. Paddleability exhibition events of K-1 200 m LTA (men & women), K-2 200 m TA&A (mixed), and C-2 200 m LTA&A (mixed) also took place (LTATA – Legs, Trunks, and Arms or Trunks and Arms; LTA – Legs, Trunks, and Arms; and TA&A – Trunks and Arms, or Arms). Support for women's Canadian and the paddle ability events were confirmed at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 18–20 March 2009. A training camp was held for women's canoe in conjunction with the championships.
Official meetings.
In January 2009, ICF Secretary General Simon Toulson visited Halifax for three days and was impressed with the history of canoeing in the area and the development of future canoers for Canada. Two public meetings were held in Dartmouth and Halifax on 24 and 26 March regarding the championships.
Facility.
During the end of 2008, Lake Banook had its canoe course upgraded by Dexter Construction Limited. Water that had been pumped out of lake ceased on 15 December 2008, allowing the lake to rise back to its regular level by February 2009. Cleanup, restoration and landscaping was completed in the spring of 2009. By May 2009, this construction included new concrete abutments at the , , , and finish points, debris and abutment cleanup, ten new lane wires, four new cross wires, and 800 new buoys. Starting gates were tested during the second national team trials held at the lake on 27–28 June 2009. Temporary grandstands for 20,000 spectators per day were also constructed.
Additional changes were for environmental reasons. This included the Halifax Regional Water Commission, Conserve Nova Scotia, and Nova Scotia Environment providing water stations for athletes, spectators and volunteers to fill up reusable water bottles which were purchased on site. It eliminated 100,000 disposable bottles and of plastic waste. Dalhousie University's residence halls used energy efficient lighting and cleaning products. The university's cafeteria eliminated the use of trays, lessening food waste, energy consumption and daily water usage by . A buy local policy and delivery truck that ran entirely on vegetable oil fuel was also used.
According to a 10 August 2009 press release, the staging area was at Birch Cove Park in Halifax. 669 from 68 countries competed at the championships with an estimated 100,000 spectators.
Sponsorships.
The Atlantic Lottery Corporation presented the "Women in Canoe" program that included 21 female canoers from 12 different countries. Festival entertainment was sponsored by the Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation, including a "Concert on the Lake" by Matt Mays on 14 August that drew 10,000 spectators. Other sponsors include Bell Aliant as presenters, silver sponsors were "The Chronicle Herald" of Halifax, CFRQ Q104 FM radio, CBC Sports and the Halifax Water Authority; the bronze sponsors were NOREX, Helly Hansen, Conserve Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia environment, Mills fashion and NELO; government sponsorship of Department of Canadian Heritage, Nova Scotia Health Promotion and Protection, and the Halifax Regional Municipality; other supporters of Mic Mac Mall, CBS Outdoor, Metro Transit of Halifax, and Office Interiors; and friends of Ambassadors, Priority Management, KayakPro, the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, and The Cider House Company Limited.
Participating nations.
68 nations were listed on the preliminary entry list. The numbers in parentheses shown are for men and women who competed for each respective nation.
Russia had the most overall attendees with 46 while Canada topped the number of women competing with 16.
The media guide listed 71 nations as participating, but seven nations listed did not compete (Cameroon, Dominican Republic, Montenegro, Nigeria, South Korea, Togo and Uganda) while four nations who competed were not listed (Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Senegal and Tajikistan).
The ICF sponsored ten athletes in a development program in Romania in early 2009 that allowed them to competed at the world championships. These countries included Algeria, Armenia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Coverage.
Media coverage was provided by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Sports in Canada, Eurosport, and Universal Sports in the United States. Live results were provided onsite from the official website that was sponsored by Bell Aliant which ran 9 am to 4:30 pm AST on 13 August, 9 AM to 3:55 pm AST on 14 August, 8:44 am to 5:45 pm AST on 15 August 2009, and 8:30 am to 3:46 pm AST on 16 August. Championship information was also available on Twitter. CBC Sports had broadcast times of 2–3 PM AST on 15 August 2009 followed by late night coverage at 12:30 am AST on 16 August 2009 along with coverage on the web at http://www.cbcsports.ca.

Schedule.
Opening and closing ceremonies.
Opening ceremonies took place at 8 pm AST on 12 August. 10,000 people watched 68 countries participate in the opening ceremonies that included Canoe'09 chair Chris Keevill, ICF President José Perurena, and Sport Canada minister Gary Lunn. The Concert on the Lake took place at 8 pm AST on 14 August with over 10,000 attendees. Closing ceremonies occurred on 16 August at 4 pm AST. Medals were presented in Mi'kmaq baskets for gold medalists, traditional European baskets for silver medalists, and in traditional African Nova Scotian baskets for bronze medalists. Mi'kmaq is a territory in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada prior to the settlement by the French in the 17th century. The settlement was rotated between the French and British between 1627 and 1755 before the British took over the area after the French and Indian War. Africans settled in Nova Scotia during the Atlantic slave trade that ran from the 16th to 19th centuries. The closing ceremonies on 16 August included passing the ICF flag from Dartmouth to the 2010 world championship hosts in Poznań.
Festival performances.
Festivals for all four days started 30 minutes before the first race and ended 30 minutes after the last race each day. Live entertainment took place each of the days along with vendors, displays and exhibits. Boating safety was discussed along with interactive exhibits on canoe construction and allowing to touch live animals from around the world, including tarantulas and a -long python.
Results.
The preliminary draw was released on 9 August. This was updated again on 11 August.
Men's.
Canoe.
Russia was the top winner with seven medals with Nikolay Lipkin winning five medals. Belarus won three gold medals. Azerbaijan won a complete set of medals in the canoe discipline while Uzbekistan won its first ever gold medal at the championships.
Kayak.
Germany won five medals in the men's kayak. Ronald Rauhe's three medals for Germany at these championships pushed his career total to 20, tying him with Torsten Gutsche (East Germany-Germany: 1989–99). Belarus won four golds with Vadzim Makhneu and Raman Piatrushenka each winning four of those golds.
Women's.
Kayak.
Hungary medaled in all nine events with Natasa Janics and Katalin Kovacs each winning five medals. Kovacs' five medals pushed her total medal count to 35, three behind Birgit Fischer's 38 (East Germany-Germany: 1978–2005). Bridgette Hartley's bronze medal in the K-1 1000 m event was the first for both South Africa and Africa at the world championships. Josefa Idem's bronze in the K-1 500 m event makes her the oldest medalist in the history of the championships.
Exhibition.
Women's canoe.
Host nation Canada won all four of the exhibition events. Jenna Marks won three of these events (C-1 200 m, C-2 200 m, C-2 500 m). Other nations with top three finishes included Brazil, Ecuador, Great Britain and the United States.
Paddleability.
Italy had four top three finishes to lead all nations in this event while the United States was second with three. 
Aftermath.
Athlete comments.
Australia's Wallace commented that he was upset at the ICF's decision that was made during the championships to replace the men's 500 m events (C-1, C-2, K-1 and K-2) at the Summer Olympics with the 200 m events (men's C-1, K-1 and K-2; and women's K-1) for the upcoming Summer Olympics in London. Kovacs of Hungary stated that the addition of the women's K-1 200 m event for the 2012 Olympics will not change her training routine. Italy's Idem, who was competing in her 20th world championships, stated that she was just as "...nervous when ...was a 13 year old girl (1977) and ...[she was... the same today." Germany's Rauhe expressed his love for Canada by "...going on holiday now." in the host nation.
Paddleability's (Paracanoe's) future.
In a 25 August 2009 ICF article, ICF Canoeing for All Committee and Canoe Kayak Canada's Domestic Development Director John Edwards thanked efforts of the paddlers involved in the paddleability events for the 2009 championships. Edwards stated that the efforts for paddleability's success are twofold. The first is for inclusion into the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece. Once this is recognized, the next goal is to get Special Olympic programs at a national level for inclusion into the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The second, a shorter-term one, is to have 24 nations from three continents participate at next year's canoe sprint world championships in Poznań. Besides the medalists from this year's world championships being from Italy, the United States, Canada, Brazil and France, other participants included Great Britain and Portugal. The process to include paddleability into the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janerio, Brazil began on 1 October 2009 and approval was reached on 16 July 2010.

Kadey-Krogen Yachts

Founded in 1977, Kadey-Krogen Yachts is one of the oldest manufacturers of long-range capable, recreational trawler yachts in the U.S. Their vessels are closely linked in naval design to the historic fishing trawlers of the North Sea and have the capability to cross any ocean. Kadey-Krogen Yachts is a semi-custom builder and manufactures 10-15 yachts per year. Six models are currently offered, ranging in size from 39 to with new models on the drawing board.
Defining aspects of the Kadey-Krogen trawler yacht are a pure full displacement hull (PFD™), a fine forward entry, a wineglass transom, a fully covered aft deck which functions as the back porch, and high quality interior joinery predominantly in teak or cherry with other selections available. Their design enables the yachts to make ocean passages in comfort and safety. Owners of Kadey-Krogen trawler yachts have reported crossing the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea.
Kadey-Krogen is headquartered in Stuart, Florida, with other offices in Annapolis and Seattle. Unlike the majority of boat manufacturers, the company does not use a dealership network, but instead works directly with customers. For the past 21 years the company's boats have been built at a dedicated yard in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Kadey-Krogens are sold direct through an in-house sales team.
Kadey-Krogen's yachts are often used as liveaboard vessels. According to company estimates, up to 75-percent of owners are part- or full-time liveaboards. While most owners have or are in the process of retiring, many continue to work and utilize their last few years working to take small trip and get acquainted with their boat and the lifestyle.
History.
In 1977, naval architect Jim Krogen and yacht broker Art Kadey met in a bar in Coconut Grove to design Kadey a live-aboard 42-foot trawler. Over a few rum punches, the origins of the first hull were sketched out in pencil on an unassuming piece of notebook paper. Based upon this deisgn, the two incorporated as Kadey-Krogen Yachts and began to produce the Krogen 42’. Over the past 36 years Kadey-Krogen Yachts has designed and built 14 different models ranging from 36’ – 58’. Six different models are available as “current production” with several others on the drawing board.
The company was founded in 1977 by Art Kadey and Jim Krogen. Art Kadey passed away in 1981 and Jim Krogen in December 1994. From 1995 until 2006 the company was owned by some of Jim’s children and their business partners. In 2006, ownership of the company was transferred to John Gear, Larry Polster, and Tom Button.
Design philosophy.
Kadey-Krogen Yachts subscribes to an important and often ignored marine design concept - Architectural Integrity, which means keeping a vessel true to its original design parameters.
In the last decade, manufacturers have ignored architectural integrity and stretched models 5–10 feet creating a new model at a relatively low cost but compromising the performance of the resulting design.
Hull form.
All Kadey-Krogens are built using their exclusive Pure Full Displacement (PFD™) hull characterized by a moderate displacement-to-length ratio, a fine entry, and end-to-end symmetry including the signature “wineglass” transom.
The Pure Full Displacement hull is differentiated from other hulls based upon two form fundamentals: longitudinal symmetry and displacement to length ratio (D/L). Longitudinal symmetry refers to the degree to which the stern shape matches the bow shape. A barge is highly symmetrical and seaworthy but does not have ideal longitudinal symmetry and therefore is not very sea kindly. A hull with good symmetry will have V-shaped sections and sharp waterlines at both ends.
There are four characteristics of a vessel with a symmetrical hull form. 
The displacement-to-length ratio (D/L) indicates whether a given displacement is carried over a long waterline length or a short one. It reflects the load the vessel has to carry on a per-foot of waterline basis. Lower ratios tend towards lean and slippery forms with fine ends, and higher ratios tend towards full-bodied and less efficient forms with blunter ends. A lighter load per foot of waterline length results in better fuel economy and range.
A vessel with a long waterline and low D/L (those in the 260-325 range) can be compared to a bank account earning compounded interest. Reducing D/L yields a more easily driven hull form thereby improving fuel economy and allowing for the use of smaller engines. The improved economy reduces the weight of fuel that must be carried for the desired range and the use of lower horsepower engines will reduce the weight of propulsion machinery. All this weight reduction now results in even greater fuel economy resulting in more weight savings resulting in even better economy, and so the benefits compound.
To ensure that strength is not compromised by this weight savings approach, Kadey-Krogen uses massive stem-to-stern fiberglass girders that are closely spaced for effective distribution of hull loads to bulkheads, and encapsulated mahogany girder inserts that allow equipment to be attached for maximum strength and reliability. Cast lead (as opposed to iron) ballast conforms to the keel contour and is concentrated low in the hull so less ballast material is required and weight is reduced. Deckhouse and hull topsides are of cored laminates for reduced weight, lower center of gravity, thermal insulation and strength. 
Critical areas are reinforced with an impact-resistant fiberglass mat containing Twaron®, which is the same fiber used to give body armor "bullet-proof" capability. Twaron is an aramid fiber that is five times stronger than steel and up to 60% lighter than ballistic steel. Kadey-Krogen is the only builder of trawlers who provides this level of hull reinforcement.
Models.
Kadey-Krogen models currently in production include:
Krogen 39' 
Krogen 44' AE 
Krogen 48’ AE 
Krogen 52’ 
Krogen 55’ Expedition 
Krogen 58'

Johann Caspar Barthel

Johann Caspar Barthel (10 June 1697 – 8 April 1771) was a German Jesuit canon lawyer.
Life.
He was born at Kitzingen, Bavaria, the son of a fisherman, attended school in Kitzingen, and from 1709 to 1715 studied at the Jesuit College at Würzburg. In 1715 he entered the seminary of the latter city and in 1721 was ordained priest. 
Christopher von Hutten, Prince-Bishop of Würzburg, sent him, in 1725, to Rome to study ecclesiastical law under Prosper Lambertini, later Pope Benedict XIV. Barthel returned as Doctor Utriusque Juris, in 1727, to Würzburg, where he became president of the seminary and (1728) professor of canon law at the university. 
Other ecclesiastical and academical honours, among them the vice-chancellorship of the university (1754), were conferred upon him. He took an active part in settling the controversy occasioned by the erection of the new Diocese of Fulda (1752). 
As a teacher, he was appreciated by both Catholics and Protestants, and his lectures were circulated at various schools. He broke with the traditional method in canonical science, being one of the first to adopt the historico-critical treatment in Germany. His efforts to distinguish between the essentials and non-essentials in Catholic doctrines, and his attribution of excessive power to the State in its relations with the Church caused his opinions to be denounced at Rome as unorthodox.
The above statement that Barthel was a Jesuit is wrong (see http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz2142.html).
Works.
In his "Promemoria" (1751) he submitted his views and method to his former teacher, Benedict XIV, and obtained a favourable decision. His works, apart from what was written in the Fulda controversy, as "De Pallio" (1753), deal principally with the relations between Church and State, especially in Germany. Several of them are found in the "Opuscula juridica varii argumenti" (Würzburg, 1765, 1771).

2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships

The 2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships were held 19–22 August 2010 in Poznań, Poland, on Lake Malta. This is the third time that the Polish city will host the championships, having done so previously in 1990 and 2001. Paracanoe (formerly paddleability) and the women's C-1 200 m events that were exhibition events at the previous world championships in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, became official events at these championships.
Germany and Hungary won the most medals at the championships with twelve each though the Hungarians won six golds, the most of the championships, compared to the Germans' five golds. Brazil, Japan and Tahiti won their first ever championship medals. Ronald Rauhe of Germany became the winningest medalist in men's kayak with his 21st career medal, earning that in a K-1 200 m silver. Rauhe eclipsed that record he had tied at the previous championships with fellow German Torsten Gutsche.

Explanation of events.
Canoe sprint competitions are broken up into Canadian canoe (C), an open canoe with a single-blade paddle, or in kayaks (K), a closed canoe with a double-bladed paddle. Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be , , or long. When a competition is listed as a C-2 500 m event as an example, it means two people are in a canoe competing at a distance.
Preliminaries to the event.

The events were confirmed following successes at the previous world championships on 18 December 2009. The schedule for the championships was released on 10 June 2010.

After attending secondary school at the International School of Geneva in Switzerland Rami returned to the US to complete his education. Rami has also served for many years as the chief umpire for Little League baseball in Jordan.
Career.
In 1971, Khoury began his career working as a reporter for the English-language newspaper the Daily Star in Beirut, Lebanon. From 1972 to 1973, Khouri continued writing columns for the paper while working as managing editor of Middle East Sketch magazine. Following a year in the United States as program administrator for the Division of International Programs Abroad at Syracuse University, Khouri returned to Beirut to become managing editor of Middle East Money in Beirut from 1973 to 1974. He then moved to Amman, Jordan, where he served as editor-in-chief of Jordan’s English-language daily, the Jordan Times, from 1975 to 1982 and again from 1987
Khoury is director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs (IFI) at the American University of Beirut. His journalistic work includes writing books and an internationally syndicated column by progressive commentary agency called Agence Global, founded by Jahan Salehi. Khoury also serves as editor at large of the Beirut-based Daily Star newspaper, published throughout the Middle East with the International Herald Tribune. In recent years he hosted "Encounter", a weekly current affairs talk show on Jordan Television, and "Jordan Ancient Cultures", a weekly archaeology program on Radio Jordan.
Khoury was a Nieman Journalism Fellow at Harvard University (2001–2002), nonresident senior fellow of the Dubai Initiative at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, John F Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University and was appointed a member of the Brookings Institution Task Force on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World.

Views on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Khouri believes that "allocating blame" is counterproductive. Writing for the "Daily Star (Lebanon)", he states that "We end up with a situation in which it becomes easy for Arabs to blame Israel and the Western powers for the problems of our region." He believes that "the truth is in between, with Arab, Israel and Western actors all having to share the blame for contributing to the distressing conditions that define the Arab world."
Awards and personal life.
Mr. Khouri was the 2004 winner of the Eliav-Sartawi Awards for Middle East Journalism in the Arab Press category In November 2006, he was the co-recipient of the Pax Christi International Peace Award for his efforts to bring peace and reconciliation to the Middle East.

Seoige

Seoige is an Irish television chat show. The show, hosted by sisters Gráinne and Sile Seoige, was broadcast live on weekdays at 16:30 on RTÉ One, with a hiatus in the summer months. Episodes were repeated at 08:20 the following weekday morning on the same channel.
The programme was originally launched in 2006 as "Seoige and O'Shea" with Grainne Seoige and Joe O'Shea at the helm. It followed a similar format to ITV's "This Morning" programme. Moving between serious issues and lighter subjects, content included interviews, debates and musical performances. Viewers could call, text or e-mail the programme's studio to give their opinions on topics. The presenters chatted with four sets of guests, which consisted of interviewees, discussion groups and musical artists.
The show was rebranded "Seoige" in August 2008 after Joe O'Shea announced he was leaving RTÉ to pursue a career in radio broadcasting.
RTÉ announced on 21 April 2009 that the show would be cancelled and that the last show would air on Friday 24 April 2009. A new series will not be commissioned for the autumn of 2009.
Episodes.
First series.
The first series began on 9 October 2006 and ran until 20 April 2007. In the first series, Seoige and O'Shea ran a short story and photograph competition. The top 14 writers were published in a book entitled "Do The Write Thing".
The winner, Ellen McCarthy, from Waterford was signed by publishers Poolbeg and her debut novel, "Guarding Maggie" was released on 2 May 2008. Following superb reaction to "Guarding Maggie", Ellen's second novel, "Guilt Ridden" was released in January 2009.
Second series.
The second series began on 1 October 2007 and ran until 18 April 2008. In the second series, the programme took on a new look and added a live studio audience. As part of the new-look series, there were also a number of new features. "Relative Values" looked at the family life of some of the nation's stars, "Home Values" showed exclusive peeks into the homes of some of Ireland's celebrities, and "Money Matters" offered solutions to money worries. There was also a regular travel slot and a weekly feature concerning psychics. There was a daily feature - "Talking Point" - where social issues were discussed. Following on from the success of the "Do The Write Thing" competition, Seoige and O'Shea began to host their own book club. On Wednesday, a well-known personality introduced his/her favourite book and was joined by a book club to review the week's chosen books. On Friday, there were musical performances and a preview spot where a panel of previewers inform viewers about the entertainment, music and sport events taking place around the country at the weekend.
Third series.
The third series began in October 2008 and saw Sile Seoige replace Joe O'Shea as co-presenter.
Guests.
Guests on the first two series' of the show include:
Reception.
Although Seoige and O'Shea claimed that the programme had proven successful, television ratings show that it has failed to enter the top 20. It launched with 100,000 viewers on 9 October 2006. In April 2008, it pulled in an average viewership of 20-21 percent of the available audience. October 2008 attracted average viewing figures of 112,000 for each episode. Critics believed that the show's time slot and topics are responsible for its low viewing figures.
Criticism.
The show's format had been criticised in editorials in both the "Irish Independent" and "The Sunday Times".
John Meagher asserted that Seoige and O'Shea had no chemistry between them: ""Where was the on-screen chemistry, the "telly marriage" that both had talked up so much in the days leading up to the start date?""
Seoige and O'Shea were perceived by John Boland as being unsuited to the field of chat shows, his description of their presentation styles stating: ""As they and O'Shea lurched awkwardly from trivial items to serious topics they were nervous and stilted - she as much as he - and nowhere did they convey the ease that would put the make viewer feel at home.""
Pat Stacey of the "Evening Herald" had asserted that Sile and Grainne had no chemistry between them.
Jade Goody's agent Max Clifford had criticised Sile and Grainne for their "aggressive" interview concerning Jade.

2011 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships

The 2011 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships was the thirty-ninth edition of the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships, that took place between 17–21 August 2011 in Szeged, Hungary. The Southern Hungarian city welcomed the world event for the third time, having hosted the championship previously in 1998 and 2006. These championships were awarded initially to Vichy, France, however, the race course on the Allier proved to be inadequate to hold the competition and the French Canoe Federation withdraw from organizing the event, following that Szeged, the original host of the 2013 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships, was moved up to 2011.
Originally 94 nations have indicated their intention to participate on the championship, from them 88 registered officially for the competition, which was the main qualification event for the 2012 Summer Olympics, since 176 of the 248 Olympic quotas were distributed in this fixture.
Germany and Russia topped the overall medal count with 11 medals each, and the Central European country won also the tied-most gold medals together with Hungary. The joy of the Germans was only overshadowed by an anthem mishap, as for their first gold medalists, Anne Knorr and Debora Niche the first verse of the national hymn was played, which is associated with the crimes of the Nazis and is not used since 1952. The organizers asked to be excused, which the head of the German Canoe Federation accepted, assuming no intent. Azerbaijani trio Sergiy Bezugliy, Maksim Prokopenko and Valentin Demyanenko collected three medals each in the men's events, while Max Hoff of Germany became the winningest canoeist with two World Championships titles. In the women's competition Hungary's Danuta Kozák was the most successful racer with two gold and a silver medal. Kozák's partner in K-2, Katalin Kovács claimed her thirty-ninth and fortieth World Championship medal and surpassed Birgit Fischer's record of 38.
Venue.
The races were held in the Maty-ér, also known as the National Kayak-Canoe and Rowing Olympic Centre, an articifal reservoir which is situated two kilometres south of Szeged. It consist a 2400 metres long and 122 metres wide race track with nine lanes and a warm-up course, and is equipped with an automatic starting system and an electric time keeper with photo finish camera to meet all the criteria of the International Canoe Federation.
In preparation for the championship, the facilities of the Maty-ér were upgraded to become a state of the art sports complex. The Hungarian government allocated 450 million HUF (approximately $2.4 million) for the procedure, in which the whole sports center became accessible for disabled people, what was an important factor, since paracanoeists also participate in the competition. There was also constructed an 11,000-seat tribune, and the VIP-building together with the finish tower was also redeveloped. New racks were installed as well to be able to store the increased number of boats, and new catamarans were put into operation to assist the smooth conduct of the competition. Moreover, LED displays were erected on the island that divides the race course and the warm-up area, and two 36-meter-high cranes were set up, which hold and move the spidercams above the water. The complete refurbishment was finished and the facilities were delivered on 9 August 2011, eight days prior to the beginning of the championship.
Preliminaries to the event.
Host selection.
In October 2007, on the congress meeting of the International Canoe Federation in Guatemala City the organization rights of the World Championships were given to Vichy, beating the bids of Athens and Szeged. The regatta course in Vichy is on a natural river, which quality is highly influenced by the weather conditions. On the 2010 World Cup events a heavy water flow was experienced on the Allier River making the racing unequal. A number of competitors, including Olympic medalists Josefa Idem and Ken Wallace expressed their concerns and dissatisfaction with the track, following that the International Canoe Federation had to reconsider its decision. In early July, after a deep analysis of the situation, being aware of the possible inequity and unfairness on a major Olympic qualification event, the French Canoe Federation with the consent of the International Canoe Federation desisted from organizing the event. On 25 July 2010 the Executive Committee of the International Canoe Federation awarded the vacant place in its meeting in Lausanne to Szeged, which came second behind Vichy in the official candidating process, and was originally scheduled to host of the 2013 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships.
Sponsorships.
The naming sponsor of the event is the petrolchemical concern MOL Group, which actively supports sports in Hungary since years, having a prominent role in ice hockey, fencing, tennis and canoeing. MOL was the main sponsor of the 2006 ICF World Championships and for years it has been the naming sponsor of the MOL World Cup, which is one of the most acknowledged regattas in the world. The official supplier of the championship is SEAT, while Magyar Telekom enters the sponsors' list as the exclusive telecommunications partner. They are present in the competition with a wide range of services, such as LAN, WLAN, 3G and IPTV, providing internet terminals for the usage. Allee Center hosts the related official events, press conferences and promotional programs. Among the media partners are a number of online and offline newspapers (Délmagyarország, Figyelő, Index.hu, IPM, Nemzeti Sport, Szabad Föld) as well as radio stations, including regional transmitter Rádió 88 and nationwide broadcasters Rádió 1 and mr1-Kossuth Rádió. Other sponsors are EDF DÉMÁSZ, ESMA Group, Hunguest Hotels, MKB Bank, Rauch, RiverRide, Theodora, Volán and Weltauto.
Coverage.
The media coverage was directed by the Hungarian Television and was taken over by 80 broadcasters, including ARD, rbb, BBC, RAI and global sports channel Eurosport. Live streaming on the official website of the event was also available. The World Championships were the first ever canoeing event, where the spidercam was used, giving a three-dimensional view of the course and making the races more lively for television viewers. 420 accredited press members were present throughout the competition, among others from Associated Press (AP), Agence France-Presse (AFP), Reuters and Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA). The event organizers also had a pioneer role in using social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter and blogs to extend the event's reach. Live results were provided by Sportline Ltd and could be reached from the official site of the event. Ovi came out with a free mobile application called "Canoe 2011", with that one could be continuously informed about the results and the latest news, both in English and Hungarian.
José Perurena, president of the International Canoe Federation expressed his satisfaction with the coverage on the closing press conference of the event, having emphasized the records that were set in the World Championship: "I'm absolutely content. The finals over the weekend took place in front of a crowd of 15,000 people, and more than 400 correspondents reported from the event, both are record numbers in the history of canoeing." Perurena also highlighted the innovative technologies that debuted on the competition and made the broadcast more enjoyable. His view was shared by Itaian Canoe Federation president Luciano Buonfiglio, who stated that "for the member countries of the international federation, Szeged has been a very good occasion, in the best way, to showcase our sport on the international stage. Hungarian television production was really fantastic."
Explanation of events.
Canoe sprint competitions are broken up into Canadian canoe (C), an open canoe with a single-blade paddle, or in kayaks (K), a closed canoe with a double-bladed paddle. Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be , , or long. When a competition is listed as a C-2 500 m event as an example, it means two people are in a canoe competing at a distance.
Paracanoeist race in the traditional kayak (K) discipline and in va'a (V), which is canoe with an outrigger, that helps the canoeist to poise the boat. The contenders are divided into three classes according to the level of their disability. Participants in LTA category have functional use of their legs, trunk and arms for paddling, and they can apply force to the footboard to propel the boat. TA class paddlers have functional use of the trunk and arms, but they are unable to apply continuous and controlled force to the footboard to propel the boat due to the weakened function of their lower limbs. Canoeist who have no trunk function are classified in the A category. At the World Championships 200 metres single events were organized for both genders in both disciplines in every disability class, however, a minimum of six competing national federations for each category were required in order to be a valid championship.
Participating nations.
88 countries have entered athletes.

David Byrne (footballer, born 1905)

David Byrne (28 April 1905 – 1 May 1990) is a former Irish football player who played as a forward.
Nicknamed Babby as he was the youngest of 11 and born in Dublin, he joined Shamrock Rovers in 1926 and had four spells at Glenmalure Park. He also played for Bradford City, Shelbourne, Sheffield United, Manchester United, Coleraine, Glentoran and Larne.
Byrne won three senior caps for the Irish Free State making a scoring debut as a Shels player on 20 April 1929 in a 4–0 friendly win against Belgium at Dalymount Park. As a Rovers player he played against Spain at the same venue on 13 December 1931. His last cap was as a Coleraine player in a World Cup qualifier against Belgium, also at Dalymount, on 25 February 1934.
He was top scorer in the League with 17 goals when Rovers went unbeaten capturing their third League Championship in 1926–27. This was his and the club's first season at Glenmalure Park. He was Rovers' top scorer the following season and in his second spell in 1929–30 and 1930–31.
In between, he had a spell with Shelbourne where he again finished top scorer with 15 goals in their second League winning season. He won four FAI Cup medals in a row scoring in the finals in 1930, the 1931 replay, the 1933 final and replay. In all he scored 85 League and 13 FAI Cup goals for the Hoops. He is the sixth-highest goalscorer in Rovers' history.
He was the last surviving member of the 1931–32 double winners. He was also the first League of Ireland player to transfer to Manchester United and the first League of Ireland player to score 100 league goals.
He transferred to Sheffield United in October 1932. Despite impressing he was released due to economic pressures and returned to Milltown the following month.
He joined Manchester United in September 1933 with fellow Irish player Billy Behan – the pair were the club's first Irish players for more than a decade. He scored on his debut for Manchester United on 21 October 1933 and scored a total of three goals in four league appearances. He also scored on his debut for Bradford City. 
Byrne is the only player to be capped for Ireland while playing for Shamrock Rovers and Shelbourne. He was surprisingly small (5 feet 5 inches in height) in an era of big centre forwards, yet he was a prolific goalscorer. He was fast, effective in the air as well as on the ground, and forced goalkeepers to make mistakes.

Fictional character biography.
Fantasia was a member of the Supreme Soviets. The team had been sent by the Soviet government to capture the Soviet Super-Soldiers, who were attempting to defect to the United States. Fantasia disguised the team members with an illusion to appear as members of the Avengers: Red Guardian as Captain America, Perun as Thor, Crimson Dynamo as Iron Man, and Sputnik as the Vision. Eventually, the real Captain America defeated the Supreme Soviets and freed the badly wounded Soviet Super-Soldiers.
Fantasia later changed her name to Fantasma when the team became known as the People's Protectorate. Eventually the team broke up and merged with the Soviet Super-Soldiers to form the Winter Guard.
Fantasma is rescued from a time anomaly by the Winter Guard, with her former teammates of the Protectorate on her trail. It is revealed that Fantasma has been a Dire Wraith queen all along. She alliances herself with the Presence and fights the Winter Guard. She is defeated by banishing her into Limbo again.
Powers and abilities.
Fantasia is skilled in magic, especially in the use of illusions. She has also shown the ability to fly and certain mental abilities.

Levi-Civita parallelogramoid

In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the Levi-Civita parallelogramoid is a quadrilateral in a curved space whose construction generalizes that of a parallelogram in the Euclidean plane. It is named for its discoverer, Tullio Levi-Civita. Like a parallelogram, two opposite sides "AA"′ and "BB"′ of a parallelogramoid are parallel (via parallel transport side "AB") and the same length as each other, but the fourth side "A"′"B"′ will not in general be parallel to or the same length as the side "AB," although it will be straight (a geodesic).
Construction.
A parallelogram in Euclidean geometry can be constructed as follows:
In a curved space, such as a Riemannian manifold or more generally any manifold equipped with an affine connection, the notion of "straight line" generalizes to that of a geodesic. In a suitable neighborhood (such as a ball in a normal coordinate system), any two points can be joined by a geodesic. The idea of sliding the one straight line along the other gives way to the more general notion of parallel transport. Thus, assuming either that the manifold is complete, or that the construction is taking place in a suitable neighborhood, the steps to producing a Levi-Civita parallelogram are:
Quantifying the difference from a parallelogram.
The length of this last geodesic constructed connecting the remaining points "A"′"B"′ may in general be different than the length of the base "AB". This difference is measured by the Riemann curvature tensor. To state the relationship precisely, let "AA"′ be the exponential of a tangent vector "X" at "A", and "AB" the exponential of a tangent vector "Y" at "A". Then
where terms of higher order in the length of the sides of the parallelogram have been suppressed.
Discrete approximation.
Parallel transport can be discretely approximated by Schild's ladder, which approximates Levi-Civita parallelogramoids by approximate parallelograms.

Knockout rat

A knockout rat is a genetically engineered rat with a single gene turned off through a targeted mutation (gene trapping) used for academic and pharmaceutical research. Knockout rats can mimic human diseases and are important tools for studying gene function (functional genomics) and for drug discovery and development. The production of knockout rats was not economically or technically feasible until 2008. 
Technology developed through funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and work accomplished by the members of the Knock Out Rat Consortium (KORC) led to cost-effective methods to create knockout rats. The importance of developing the rat as a more versatile tool for human health research is evidenced by the $120 million investment made by the NIH via the Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium, resulting in the draft sequence of the Brown Norway laboratory rat ("Rattus norvegicus"). Additional developments with zinc finger nuclease technology in 2009 led to the first knockout rat with targeted, germline-transmitted mutations. Knockout rat disease models for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, hypertension, and diabetes using zinc-finger nuclease technology are being commercialized by SAGE Labs.
Research use.
Mice, rats, and humans share all but approximately 1% of each other's genes making rodents good model organisms for studying human gene function. Both mice and rats are relatively small, easily handled, have a short generation time, and are genetically inbred. While mice have proven to be a useful rodent model and techniques have been developed for routine disruption of their genes, in many circumstances rats are considered a superior laboratory animal for studying and modeling human disease. 
Rats are physiologically more similar to humans than are mice. For example, rats have a heart rate more similar to that of humans, while mice have a heart rate five to ten times as fast. It is widely believed that the rat is a better model than the mouse for human cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and many autoimmune, neurological, behavioral, and addiction disorders. In addition, rat models are superior to mouse models for testing the pharmacodynamics and toxicity of potential therapeutic compounds, partially because the number and type of many of their detoxifying enzymes are very similar to those in humans. Their larger size makes rats more conducive to study by instrumentation, and also facilitates manipulation such as blood sampling, nerve conduction, and performing surgeries. 
Techniques for genetic manipulation are available in the mouse, which is commonly used to model human disease. Although published knockouts exist for approximately 60% of mouse genes, a large majority of common human diseases do not have a knockout mouse model. Knockout rat models are an alternative to mice that may enable the creation of new gene disruptions that are unavailable in the mouse. Knockout rat models can also complement existing transgenic mouse models. Comparing mouse and rat mutants can facilitate the distinction between rodent-specific and general mammalian phenotypes.
Production challenges.
Rat models have been used to advance many areas of medical research, including cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders (studies of behavioral intervention and addiction), neural regeneration, diabetes, transplantation, autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis), cancer, and wound & bone healing. While the completion of the rat genome sequence provides very key information, how these diseases relate to gene function requires an efficient method to create knockout rat models in which specific genomic sequences are manipulated.
Most techniques for genetic manipulation, including random mutagenesis with a gene trap (retroviral-based and non-retroviral-based), gene knock-outs/knock-ins, and conditional mutations, depend upon the culture and manipulation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Rat ES cells were only recently isolated and no demonstration of gene modification in them has been reported. Consequently, many genetic manipulation techniques widely used in the mouse are not possible in the rat.
Early methods.
Until the commercial development of mobile DNA technology in 2007 and zinc-finger nuclease technology in 2009, there were only two technologies that could be used to produce rat models of human disease: cloning and chemical mutagenesis using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Although cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) could theoretically be used to create rats with specific mutations by mutating somatic cells, and then using these cells for SCNT, this approach has not been used successfully to create knockout rats. One problem with this strategy is that SCNT is extremely inefficient. The first published attempt had a success rate of less than 1%. Alternatively, ENU mutagenesis is a common random mutagenesis gene knockout strategy in the mouse that can also be used in the rat. ENU mutagenesis involves using a chemical, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), to create single base changes in the genome. ENU transfers its ethyl group to oxygen or nitrogen radicals in DNA, resulting in mis-pairing and base pair substitution. Mutant animals can be produced by injecting a male mouse with ENU, and breeding with a wild type female to produce mutant offspring. ENU mutagenesis creates a high frequency of random mutations, with approximately one base pair change in any given gene in every 200-700 gametes. Despite its high mutagenicity, the physical penetration of ENU is limited and only about 500 genes are mutated for each male and a very small number of the total mutations have an observable phenotype. Thousands of mutations typically need to be created in a single animal in order to generate one novel phenotype. 
Despite recent improvements in ENU technology, mapping mutations responsible for a particular phenotype is typically difficult and time-consuming. Neutral mutations must be separated from causative mutations, via extensive breeding. ENU and cloning methods are simply inefficient for creating and mapping gene knockouts in rats for the creation of new models of human disease. Through 2007, the largest rat ENU mutagenesis project to date run by the Medical College of Wisconsin was able to produce only 9 knockout rat lines in a period of five years at an average cost of $200,000 per knockout line. Although some companies are still pursuing this strategy, the Medical College of Wisconsin has switched to a more efficient and commercially viable method using mobile DNA and CompoZr ZFN technology.
Zinc-finger and TALE nuclease technology.
Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) are engineered DNA-binding proteins that facilitate targeted editing of the genome by creating double-strand breaks in DNA at user-specified locations. Double strand breaks are important for site-specific mutagenesis in that they stimulate the cell’s natural DNA-repair processes, namely homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. When the cell uses the non-homologous end joining pathway to repair the double-strand break, the inherent inaccuracy of the repair often generates precisely targeted mutations. This results in embryos with targeted gene knockout. Standard microinjection techniques allow this technology to make knockout rats in 4–6 months. A major advantage of ZFN- and TALEN-mediated gene knockout relative to the use of mobile DNA is that a particular gene can be uniquely and specifically targeted for knockout. In contrast, knockouts made using mobile DNA technology are random and are therefore unlikely to target the gene of interest.
Mobile DNA technology.
Mobile DNA (jumping gene) technology uses retrotransposons and transposons for the production of knockout rat models. This platform technology meets all of the criteria for a successful gene knockout approach in mammals by permitting random mutagenesis directly in the germ cells (sperm and oocytes) of mammalian model organisms, including rats. Using this technology, genes are disrupted completely and in a stable manner, are knocked out at a high frequency, and are randomly disrupted throughout the entire genome. The genomic location of mutations can be easily mapped, creating a library of knockout rats for later use. Once the random knockout mutations are created, more refined mutations such as conditional mutations can be created by breeding knockout lines with rat lines expressing CRE recombinase in a tissue specific manner. Knock-ins can be produced by recombination mediated cassette exchange.
"piggyBac" (PB) DNA transposons.
"piggyBac" (PB) DNA transposons mobilize via a "cut-and-paste" mechanism whereby a transposase enzyme (PB transposase), encoded by the transposon itself, excises and re-integrates the transposon at other sites within the genome. PB transposase specifically recognizes PB inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the transposon; it binds to these sequences and catalyzes excision of the transposon. PB then integrates at TTAA sites throughout the genome, in a relatively random fashion. For the creation of gene trap mutations (or adapted for generating transgenic animals), the transposase is supplied in trans on one plasmid and is co-transfected with a plasmid containing donor transposon, a recombinant transposon comprising a gene trap flanked by the binding sites for the transposase (ITRs). The transposase will catalyze the excision of the transposon from the plasmid and subsequent integration into the genome. Integration within a coding region will capture the elements necessary for gene trap expression. PB possesses several ideal properties: (1) it preferentially inserts within genes (50 to 67% of insertions hit genes) (2) it exhibits no local hopping (widespread genomic coverage) (3) it is not sensitive to
over-production inhibition in which elevated levels of the transposase cause decreased transposition 4) it excises cleanly from a donor site, leaving no “footprint,” unlike Sleeping Beauty.
Sleeping beauty (SB) transposons.
The sleeping beauty (SB) transposon is a derivative of the Tc1/mariner superfamily of DNA transposons prevalent among both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. However, endogenous DNA transposons from this family are completely inactive in vertebrate genomes. An active Tc1/mariner transposon, synthesized from alignment of inactive transposons from the salmonid subfamily of elements, was “awoken” to form the transposon named Sleeping Beauty. SB, like other DNA transposons, mobilizes itself via a cut-and-paste mechanism whereby a transposase enzyme, encoded by the transposon itself, excises and re-integrates the transposon at other sites within the genome. The 340 amino acid SB protein recognizes inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the transposon; it binds to these sequences and catalyzes excision of the transposon. SB then integrates into random sites within the genome, although some studies report very slight preferences for transcriptional units. There is also a simple requirement of a TA-dinucleotide at the target site, like all Tc1/mariner transposons.
The SB transposon is a powerful tool for insertional mutagenesis in many vertebrate species. It recently exhibited especial utility for germ line mutagenesis in both mice and rats. There are several advantages that make SB a highly attractive mutagen geared toward gene discovery: 1) it has little bias for inserting within particular genomic regions or within specific recognition sequences, 2) de novo insertions of the transposon provide a “tagged” sequence marker for rapid identification of the specific mutation by simple PCR cloning methods, 3) in vivo SB insertional mutagenesis allows multiple mutations to be quickly and easily generated in a single animal, and in a single tissue, such as an adenomatous polyp.
LINE1 (L1) retrotransposons.
Transposons and retrotransposons are valuable tools for unbiased gene discovery as mobile pieces of DNA used for gene disruption. Retrotransposons, such as LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), mobilize via a “copy and paste” mechanism and are abundant in many eukaryotic species. Several L1 retrotransposons have remained active in mice and humans. L1s contain a small internal promoter within a 5’ untranslated region to drive expression, two open reading frames (ORFs), and a 3’ untranslated region containing sequences for polyadenylation. The two ORFs encode proteins necessary for autonomous retrotransposition; ORF1 encodes an RNA-binding protein while ORF2 encodes a protein containing endonuclease (EN) and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, which nick a site in DNA, then produce a copy via RT. These proteins exhibit an overwhelming specificity for binding to and acting on the transcript that encodes them, enabling near exclusive mobilization of the parental L1 RNA. Using the RT activity of the ORF2 protein, the transcribed L1 RNA is copied into DNA by a process termed target primed reverse transcription (TPRT), and integrated into the genome. Integration occurs with little bias for any particular genomic region, requiring a simple consensus sequence, 5’TTTT’A-3’ (along with minor variations of this sequence). Integrated L1 sequences are often truncated at the 5’ end, with an average total size of 1 Kb, many containing only 3’ terminal sequences. 
The nature of retrotransposition endows the L1 with some unique advantages; L1 retrotransposons have an essentially unlimited supply of the insertional mutagen since it is continually transcribed from a promoter, which would be useful for applications where large numbers of mutations are needed in a single cell. L1 elements also demonstrate widespread genomic coverage, with a largely random distribution of insertions. L1 insertions at genomic sites are also irreversible, and thus any mutagenic event caused by an L1 insertion is “tagged” by L1 sequences.

List of Shōnen Onmyōji characters

This is the list of characters that appear in the Japanese light novel, manga and anime series, "Shōnen Onmyōji". 
House of Abe.
Abe no Masahiro.
Masahiro is the protagonist in the series. He is an Onmyōji in training and the grandson of the legendary Abe no Seimei. When he was young, Masahiro’s spiritual sight was so strong that Seimei temporarily sealed it away until he was old enough to properly use it. After meeting Mokkun, Masahiro regained his spirit sight and embraced his destiny as an Onmyōji in service to the emperor. 
He is friendly and kind to both yōkai and people whom he seeks to protect from evil demons that had taken up residence surrounding the imperial capital. Although he is sometimes cocky and clumsy, there are moments when he utilizes powers beyond those of a mere apprentice, which is why Seimei claims he is the only one who can succeed him. Masahiro greatly resents being known only as and trains hard to surpass his grandfather. 
He has two older brothers whom both are married and has families of their own. Narachika is the eldest in the family. His second older brother, Masachika is ten years older than he is.
According to Ten’itsu, children in the Abe residence were often taken care by the twelve Shinshō. It was seen through flashbacks in the anime that Masahiro was taken care by Guren. 
In addition to his magic, Masahiro later receives a sword called the Gōma no Tsurugi, a sword which was forged by Seimei which previously belonged to Suzaku. He was also given by Takao no Kami, flames that has the power to kill gods, in order to destroy the corrupted Guren. 
In addition, he erased Guren’s memories that are about him, meaning that Guren will never remember the time when he met Masahiro in the form of a mononoke or the time when they were fighting demons together.
He cares a lot about his friends, his family and his love, Fujiwara no Akiko whom he vows to protect no matter what.
Abe no Seimei.
The greatest onmyōji in the history of Japan, Abe no Seimei is the grandfather of Masahiro. He is in his 80’s and he has twelve "shikigami" called the Shinshō whom he calls his friends under his command and is able to protect his soul, which takes the form of his younger self, outside of his body in order to aid Masahiro in combat. However, by doing so leaves his body defenceless if an enemy attacks. 
He constantly needles Masahiro to push him further in his journey as a sort of reverse psychology, which causes Masahiro to refer to Seimei as a "tanuki" or raccoon dog. 
Rumour has it that Seimei's mother was not human but a powerful fox spirit, which may explain why he is so powerful. Despite showing such a happy attitude, there were two moments of his life that he was sad, the first when he could not save his only best friend, Ryūsai and secondly the death of his wife, Wakana whom he loved deeply. 
The character is loosely based on a real person of the same name.
Abe no Wakana.
Wakana is Seimei’s wife and Yoshimasa’s mother. She died when he was only two years old due to an illness. Although she died a long time ago, her spirit has not cross to the other side. 
Masahiro also met her for the first time in the final episode and not knowing that she is his grandmother. He met her in the spirit world when he was ready to cross over to the other side, and she invites Masahiro to sit beside her. There she tells him that her lover has not come, and that is the reason why she could not cross to the other side just yet. 
Wakana also reminded Masahiro of the person that is precious to him and managed to persuade him to return.
Abe no Yoshimasa.
Yoshimasa is Masahiro's father and Seimei's youngest son. He is married to Tsuyuki and has three sons: Narichika, Masachika and Masahiro. He has a doctorate in stargazing and is a prominent figure in the onmyō world. 
However, he is not as powerful as Seimei or Masahiro (after he realizes his potential). Yoshimasa realizes that Masahiro is the true heir to Seimei, as acknowledged by Guren, as he is the only one not afraid of his aura.
He is a kind and supportive father, makes up excuses for Masahiro at the onmyō dorms when he goes to fight demons and purposefully ignoring his nightly escapades.
Abe no Tsuyuki.
Tsuyuki is Yoshimasa’s wife and Masahiro’s mother. She knows about Masahiro fighting demons at night but does not say anything to him because she wants him to tell her personally.
Later in series, Tsuyuki also teaches Akiko things that girls her age do, such as going shopping in the market and sewing.
She knows Yoshimasa very well; she could tell that he is worried about Masahiro going to Izumo to kill the corrupted Guren even when he does not tell her. Yoshimasa even went as far to say that the thought on how well Tsuyuki understand himself frightens him.
Abe no Narichika.
Narachika is Yoshimasa's eldest son and Masahiro's oldest brother. He has an easygoing personality and is, personality wise out of the three brothers, most similar to Seimei. 
He married into his wife's family and has two sons and a one year old daughter named Kōhime, . Narichika has a doctorate in calendar and date studies, making him a highly recognized figure in the dorm. 
He cares for his family and Masahiro a lot.
House of Fujiwara.
Fujiwara no Akiko.
Akiko is an imperial princess and the daughter of the minister of the left. She and Masahiro first meet in the Imperial Palace after his coming of age ceremony and the two become good friends after he saves her from a demon attack. As the series progresses, both of them fall in love with each other. 
Akiko is special, as she possesses the Kenki ability (the ability to see demons). Moreover, because of this, during the beginning of the series, the foreign demons constantly attack her to deliver Akiko as a sacrifice to their master. They manage to capture her but Masahiro and his allies were able to save her, but not before the demons gave a curse wound on her hand.
Halfway through the series, Akiko's father attempted to introduce her into the imperial court as a wife for the Emperor, thereby separating her from Masahiro forever. In her moment of sadness, Kyūki was able to put a powerful curse through her wounded hand. While the curse was eventually removed, according to Seimei the after-effects of the curse were so serious to Akiko that an onmyōji was required keep the curse from overwhelming her. 
As a result, she was not sent to imperial court -as that would bring bad luck to the Emperor- so her half-sister Shōko, who looks the same as her, was sent into the palace in her place. Akiko was instead sent to live with Seimei's family to deal with the curse under the identity as distant relative of theirs. (There are suggestions that Seimei tricked Akiko's father into thinking that so she and Masahiro could remain close, since he knows about their feelings for each other. However, it is also revealed Seimei was having difficulty in finding an auspicious date to send Akiko to court.) 
It should be also noted that her Kenki ability is stronger than both Seimei and Masahiro because she was able to see a spirit that was possessing Masahiro while neither Masahiro nor Seimei could.
At the Abe residence, Akiko remains a strong help to Masahiro and helps around the house, learning to do things what an ordinary girl does, like going shopping by herself thanks to the help of Tsuyuki, Masahiro's mother.
During the middle of the series (episode 10), Masahiro promises Akiko that he will show her fireflies at Kifune mountain next year at summer time. In the final episode of the anime, he is shown fulfilling his promise.
Fujiwara no Yukinari.
Yukinari is the minister of the right to the Emperor, whose primary duty is the management and upkeep the imperial capital. 
Yukinari takes a liking to Masahiro from the moment they meet, and constantly encourages him to advance in his studies because he knows he will be a powerful onmyōji like Seimei, which of course promotes a high amount of jealousy among Masahiro's peers in the Onmyō dorms. Seimei helped him long ago and because of this Yukinari offered to be Masahiro's guardian at his coming of age ceremony in return.
During the series, he was cursed by a vengeful spirit who had mistaken him for his grandfather, but the spirit was later exorcised thanks to Masahiro. 
He also seems to be aware of Masahiro's activities in fighting demons.
Fujiwara no Toshitsugu.
Toshitsugu is two years Masahiro's senior; he works at the Onmyō dorms with him. He is a diligent worker who values effort and hard work above all else. He has a nickname, 
He was the first person who talked to Masahiro but after a misunderstanding of seeing Masahiro at night when he was supposed to be at home on rest. Toshitsugu's attitude became harsh and critical, saying he should not do as he wishes just because of his family's influence. 
Toshitsugu shows promise as an onmyōji by "normal" standards (not compared to Seimei or Masahiro). He does not know of Masahiro's power, but gets suspicious after a cloaked Masahiro saved him. 
He was possessed by a vengeful spirit summoned by Kazane in the Kazane arc and placed a curse on Yukinari who had taken care of him since he was young. Masahiro eventually breaks the curse where he had no memory of the incident.
The Twelve Shinshō.
The twelve Shinshō have been in existence for a very, very long time and can be considered as gods of the lower rank. Currently they fall under the command of Abe no Seimei, the greatest onmyōji of all time. Unless Seimei summons them, they usually reside in the spirit world of the Gods.
As told by Takao no Kami, the goddess of Kifune Mountain, the twelve Shinshō are special as they were actually created by peoples' dreams. Over time, people's dreams and imaginations were transformed into the twelve Shinshō, giving them unique forms and personalities. 
They can be considered as the children of humans. Hence, there is a golden rule that they must never harm a human let alone kill one. If they break that rule, they will lose their souls and become demons.
Although they are gods whom possesses strong powers, they can be injured, feel pain and lose their lives. When one of them dies they will be reborn instantly as people's dreams never stop giving them their form but they will forget their past self and continue on as a completely different god.
Mokkun/Guren/Tōda.
Guren is one of twelve Shinshō in service to Seimei, who gave him his current name, after he pledged his servitude. His original name is Tōda, . However, the other Shinshō still address him by his original name. Only Seimei and Masahiro call him Guren.
The form he takes most of the time is an ayakashi although Masahiro considers him a mononoke, whom Masahiro named Mokkun. Because he's invisible to anyone without a spirit sense, Mokkun frequently plays tricks on people who annoy him, much to Masahiro's chagrin. It was also shown in the anime that Guren dislikes babies, because according to him, babies often cry for no reason. However, Masahiro disagrees, saying that Guren was merely afraid that the children who saw him would hate him.
From the time Masahiro was a baby, Guren watched over and protected him, as Masahiro was the only person who was not afraid of him. Because of this, despite how they constantly bicker with each other, Masahiro and Guren share a deep sense of friendship and trust between them and both are willing to lay down their own lives for the other. 
It is also mentioned that Guren is one of most feared summon gods, possessing the power of controlling the fires of Hell. Seimei also created a golden ring to wear around Guren's head to keep his own strength from overwhelming him. 
Since Masahiro does not fear Guren, Seimei cites this as the proof his grandson is the only one compatible to be his successor. In the form of Mokkun, the familiar is able to erect barriers and project crescent shaped blades of energy; in the form of Guren, he attacks with blasts of fire and a trident. 
In the past, Seimei’s best friend Ryūsai who ordered Guren by using the Baku-kon spell, a spell that could forcefully control anyone’s heart. He used it on Guren to kill Seimei and after that kill him. In addition, because of that incident the other Shinshō do not trust him. Nevertheless, that began to change with Masahiro's help, as stated by Kōchin.
Later in the series, he is corrupted by Chishiki no Gūji, losing his soul and becoming a cold-blooded monster who almost leaves Masahiro to die. It is later revealed that he’s a slave of the Underworld, as he controls the Fires of Hell. His blood was required to break the final seal of the gate to the Underworld. 
At the end of the anime, Masahiro revives Guren; saving his life in exchange for Guren's memories of Masahiro being sealed away, so he would not have to remember and regret the terrible things he has done. Despite Guren having no memory of who he is, Masahiro felt that this was better than seeing him die. However, Guren is sill one of Seimei's familiars. As such, he is under orders from Seimei to continue to look after Masahiro.
Kōchin.
Kōchin appears as a mature-looking woman, about 25 years old with shoulder-length black hair. She is ranked second strongest of the twelve in attack power, after Guren. She specializes in close range fighting with twin sai.
Unlike the others, Kōchin does not resent Guren as much and is actually his close friend shown in that he refers to Kōchin as 'Kō'. When Masahiro asks him about this, he refused to respond. 
She has also watched over Masahiro when he was a baby together with Guren. She is very observant and has a clear grasp of all of the Shinshō's personalities. She is also very good at noticing small details.
Her second name from Seimei is Keito, 
Rikugō.
Rikugō's primary role is to be the on-call bodyguard to Seimei but he will leave Seimei's side to aide Masahiro should he be ordered to. His sense of loyalty is so strong that he was willing to put aside his doubts regarding Masahiro's abilities and accepted him as Seimei's successor on little more than his master's assurances. 
He differs from the other Shinshō in that he rarely use magical attacks, preferring instead to fight opponents with a barbed spear. He can also use his cape as a shield and create an explosive 360-degree shock wave of air by striking the ground with his weapon. He also has a chain that was used against the corrupted Guren but he overpowered him. 
Rikugō is a man of few words and only speaks when he must. The only way to notice any change in his emotions was through his eyes. This began to change, however, after he met Kazane whom he fell in love with. He saved Kazane's life twice. The first, when she was swallowed by a demon and there was another time when they were in the underworld. 
He began to show emotions soon after that. He was furious when she was killed. Just before she died, they shared an emotional embrace and he revealed to her that his name is Saiki, and that she is the only one he told his name to. 
Seimei gave him the name Rikugo, and only Seimei and Kazane know "Saiki" as well.
Seiryū.
Seiryū is stubborn, anti-social and has a bad temper. He holds a deep hatred for Guren due to his attempted murder of Seimei and considers Masahiro to be unworthy to be Seimei's successor. 
Seiryū even went as far as to say that if Guren ever harms a human again, he would personally kill him. 
He attacks with blasts of lightning and fights with a large two handed scythe. His second name from Seimei is Shōran . Seiryū cares about Seimei's wellbeing more than any of the others. However, he always shows his care through anger.
Suzaku.
Suzaku is a fire user like Guren. Unlike his destructive flames, Suzaku's flames are used to purify evil spirits. He uses a heavy-bladed Zanbato to slash his enemies.
Suzaku has bright red hair and wears a white strip of cloth around his forehead, which was Ten’itsu's. He is very much in love with Ten’itsu and is fiercely protective of her due to her wound transfer ability, going as far as to hit Masahiro after Ten’itsu saved him.
The reason he cares about her was that Ten’itsu’s past self was Suzaku's best friend who was reborn right before his eyes after she died. Not wanting to lose her again, he becomes her protector. 
His sword was later lent to Masahiro so he can use it with the power to kill gods.
Ten'itsu.
Ten’itsu has the appearance of a young woman with long blond hair. The earring she is wearing belongs to Suzaku. Unlike the other members of the Shinshō, she specializes more in magic than combat, particularly healing and clairvoyance. However, she is still able to create defensive shields with her magic. 
When someone has a very serious wound, she heals it by transferring the wound on her, something her lover and fellow Shinshō Suzaku distresses over.
Ten’itsu has another name, Tenki, which only Suzaku calls her by. She is usually seen protecting Akiko or just keeping her company. She is the only Shinshō of the twelve that has died before. Her past self wore her hair short and was loud and energetic.
Tai’in.
Tai’in is a wind user who resembles a young girl with high pigtails. She also has a childish personality despite living for so long. She was said to be rash by a fair few of the Shinshō.
Tai’in attacks with mini tornadoes and can also use the wind to communicate and pass messages. She can also 'read' the wind to know what is happening at other places but she is not good at it. 
Because of her personality, she is often at the receiving end of one of Byakko's lectures with the current record that lasts 8 hours. Tai’in does not like slimy things and often appears with Genbu. 
She can create a tornado to transport people to other places but the ride is usually very rough. A recurring gag in the series is that whenever she uses this, Masahiro and Genbu falls on the ground with only the other Shinshō remaining standing.
Genbu.
Genbu resembles a young boy of about 13 years old. Although not possessing much ability in combat, Genbu specializes in defence and making barriers. However, out of the four people that can make barriers, his ability is the weakest.
He is a water user and has a water mirror that allows the user to see things happening far away. He can also use this mirror to communicate with fellow water user, Tenkō. Genbu is often seen with Tai’in who he constantly berates on some of the things she does.
Tenkō.
Tenkō is a water user like Genbu. She appears to be about the same age as Kazane and has long, light sliver hair. Tenkō is the weakest out of the eight fighting and is angry with her for that. She gets along well with Kōchin.
She is about as stubborn as Seiryū but has her gentle side. She first appears in the 20th episode & finally had her first speaking role in the final episode of the series.
Taijō.
Taijō is a man with green hair. He appears as a very peaceful, respectful man who always call Seimei's family with the suffix "sama". 
He first appeared in the 20th episode & finally had his first speaking role in the final episode of the series.
Byakko.
Byakko resembles a strong middle-aged man with grayish-green hair. Like Tai’in, he is a wind user but his wind is more 'gentle' and travels slower than Tai’in's. He treats Tai’in and Genbu like his children. 
He is also the only one that can keep Tai’in under control.
Tenkū.
Tenkū resembles an old man with a long beard. He is the governor of the twelve Shinshō and rarely leaves the spirit world. 
He also has the strongest ability of making barriers and defence among all the Shinshō. This was seen with the fact that he can immobilize enemies without leaving the spirit world. 
He also makes all the Shinshō's weapons. He first appears in the 20th episode & finally had his first speaking role in the final episode of the series where he talks to Takao no Kami about Masahiro’s willingness to save Guren at the cost of his life.
Other important characters.
Takaokami no Kami.
She is the dragon goddess of Kifune Mountain. She is a very powerful god that the twelve Shinshō including Seimei respect. When Kyūki and his demons came to Japan, he manipulated Akiko's cousin Keiko to seal her so that he and his demons could hide at Kifune Mountain without interference. Masahiro who used his magic to break the seal later freed her.
As a sign of gratitude, she saves Masahiro's life after a possessed Akiko stabs him. Later in the series, she helps Masahiro and his companions when the capital is in trouble. She also took over Masahiro's body to discuss important issues with Guren regarding Masahiro but later decides to tell the latter herself in her human form.
She usually appears as a white dragon but later appears as a purple haired woman in her 30's usually telling anyone to call Takao when she is in her human form. Even so, her official name is . 
She later gave Masahiro , flames that has the power to kill gods in order to kill Guren who has been corrupted.
Kuromanosuke.
A yōkai who resembles a carriage with a wide-mouthed ogre's face mounted on the left wheel. 
Masahiro first encountered Kurumanosuke while patrolling the streets of the capital and almost exorcised him for allegedly attacking a human, but spared him after realizing Kuramanosuke was only trying to help a drunk who had passed out in the street.
Later, Kuramanosuke accepted Masahiro as his master and serve him by taking him to places he wants to go. When the capital was invaded by demons from the Underworld, it was Kurumanosuke who help hid the Zakki in his carriage to save their lives.
The Zakki.
The term 'zakki' is used to refer to the demons of lower rank. Since Masahiro exorcised Ban Ban, a demon that was attacking the Zakki, they now act as informants for Masahiro, telling him of any strange happenings or sightings. 
In the anime, the Zakki are usually represented by three demons; a lizard with three eyes, a yellow skinned gremlin and a pink, round ball. The Zakki usually appear by suddenly dropping out of the sky and landing on his head and calling him "Seimei's grandson" much to his dismay, a running gag in the light novels and anime.
Kyūki Arc.
Kyūki.
The leader of the foreign demons, Kyūki's form is that of a gigantic winged tiger with horns and saber fangs but can also assume the shape of a massive demon bull. After losing his territory in China to a rival demon, Kyūki and his army of demons seek to establish a new territory in Japan, specifically around the imperial capital. 
Although possessing incredible strength and power, Kyūki is hampered by a massive wound on his throat inflicted by the demon which chased him from China and which requires the consumption of someone possessing great spiritual power in order to heal. As Seimei is too strong for him to attack, Kyūki targets Masahiro instead but also pursues Akiko as well for her Kenki ability and because beautiful longhaired girls are his favorite food. 
He usually has his followers attack his enemies and uses his enemies’ desires to control them. He is eventually killed when Masahiro uses the Gōma no Tsurugi to stab him though the chest in order to transmit a spell directly into Kyūki's body.
Fujiwara no Keiko.
Fujiwara no Keiko is Akiko's cousin and a member of the Fujiwara clan. She was once engaged to a man she was about to marry but the man bewed another woman instead. What angered her was the fact that the woman he married was from a higher noble family and had begged the man to marry her. 
Heartbroken, Kyūki uses that to his advantage to possess her with the promise that if she helps him, he will curse the wife of his beloved’s face that will force him to leave her and to be with Keiko again. 
While the possessing made her sick and bedridden, she was able to leave her home using her cursed spirit to travel. She helped Kyūki by sealing the dragon goddess of Kifune Mountain so his army could hide the mountain. 
She was willing to do anything to be with the man she loved, even killing anyone who gets in her way and sacrificing her cousin Akiko. 
Seimei finally exorcised her possessed spirit and she wakes up in her home not remembering what had happened.
Ban Ban.
Looking like a giant-bodied rat with the head of a turtle, he was one of Kyūki's followers. He was also the demon that made Masahiro realize that the demons he was fighting were from China. 
He first appears in Masahiro dreams and later attack the Zakki in their hideout where he dies bleeding from his injuries from fighting Guren and Masahiro.
Gaku.
Gaku is one of Kyūki's advisors and lieutenants to his followers. It always looks down upon their opponents believing all of them are weak. The other adviser is Shun 
It was one of the demons whom were responsible for putting a cursed wound on Akiko's hand. Due to his overconfidence, Masahiro and the Shinshō finally killed them.
Kazane Arc.
Kazane.
She is initially introduced as a daughter of Ryūsai. She is a formidable fighter, able to use magic and weapons as well. She is able to stand her ground and even defeat Seiryu and Genbu in a 2-on-1 battle.
She has a deep hatred for Guren because she believes that he killed her father. She has a crow for a companion named Kai and cares very deeply for it. She and Rikugō seem to have feelings for each other. 
Rikugō has the most confrontations with her and ended up falling in love with her. He tried to talk some sense in her that Chishikii no Gūji is just using her to open the Underworld but she replied that it is of her own free will. 
It is later revealed that she is not really Ryūsai’s daughter but in fact the daughter of Chigaeshi no Miko. Chishiki no Gūji kidnapped her when she was young and had her memories sealed. She was trained by Ryūsai and was told a lie that Seimei and Guren were responsible for her parents’ death. 
Unknown to her, she was secretly used to open the first gate of the Underworld due to the fact only those related to the Priestess can open the gate. 
When she found out the truth and was weakened by Chishiki no Gūji to open the gate, she tried to escape from the underworld demons where her pet crow, Kai sacrificed his life by teleporting her away. Sadly, it was all in vain as she was killed by a demon who stabbed her through the chest.
Despite being a villain, she was still a good person since did care about Princess Nagako and tried to send her back to her family as she regretted kidnapping and using her in the first place.
Her last moments before dying were with Rikugō who held her in his arms where she learned his real name. Her necklace was used to defeat Chishiki no Gūji and was later given to Rikugō by her mother who later brought her daughter's body back to their home.
Nagako Naishinō.
She is the Emperor's daughter. When her baby brother was born, her parents ignored her who was joyful that they finally had a son. She felt lonely and bitter that here parents were ignoring her where Kazane who was disguised as a nanny soon befriended her. Kazane use her anger to curse the capital. 
Despite being used by Kazane, she still love her since she was the only friend she ever had as Kazane knew what it was like being lonely. When she was sent into the underworld, she felt nobody including her mother, cared about her anymore. 
When Masahiro and Genbu shown her that her mother still care for her and regret not spending time with her that she realize her parents still love her. She was later sent back to her family.
Chigaeshi no Miko.
She is mother of Kazane. She resides in the Overturned Earth, a realm between the human world and the underworld where the guardians of the underworld protects her and her family, large animals whose duty is to serve the Priestess and protect the seal of the Underworld. 
Fifty years before the Kazane arc began; she sought the help of onmyōji Seimei and Ryūsai to help her seal the gates of the underworld since the seal was getting weaker. However, Ryūsai fell deeply in love and kidnapped her instead. 
She later left Ryūsai to go back to the realm but was kidnapped by Chishiki no Gūji. He sealed her into a frozen rock since he could not get her to open the Underworld gate; instead, he used her daughter, Kazane. She was later found and rescued by Seimei. 
However, she was later in grief when she found out her daughter, Kazane died. She later brought back her daughter's body back to her home and gave Rikugō her necklace as a sign of gratitude for protecting her daughter.
Ryūsai Enoki.
He is Seimei's only best friend and a powerful onmyōji. While Ryūsai was not as powerful as Seimei, he had learnt the Baku-kon spell. The Baku-kon spell could forcefully control anyone’s heart, which is a spell that Seimei dislikes. 
Fifty-five years ago, he accompanied Seimei to Izumo to check a disturbance there despite objection by Seimei not to follow him. There, he and Seimei met Chigaeshi no Miko who he fell deeply in love with. He was soon manipulated by Chishiki no Gūji to kidnap the Priestess and break the seal of the Underworld and made to believe that by doing so, he could get the Priestess all for himself. 
When Guren and Seimei tried to stop him, he uses the Baku-kon spell on Guren and made him try to kill Seimei. Guren finally killed him, but his body was used by Chishiki no Gūji's soul. He uses his body to help him in his plan with the promise that he could still get the Priestess all for himself. His body was finally destroyed by Rikugō & Seimei and his spirit thanks Seimei for freeing him.
Chishiki no Soushu.
He is the real villain that has been controlling Kazane and Ryūsai. Seimei and his Shinshō fought him once before many years ago, but now he has returned to open the Gates of the Underworld. 
He is also called by the name of or 
Rikugō was the first one to realize he was back because he heard Kazane talking to him through a second head protruding from her crow, Kai. 
When he was mortally injured, he transferred his soul into Ryūsai's body to continue his plans. He trained Kazane and lied about what happen to her parents so she would help him open the gates of the underworld. 
He later also controls Guren since his blood was needed to break the final seal. He was finally killed, ironically by Kazane's necklace.

Ezriel Auerbach

Rabbi Ezriel Auerbach (b. 1937), also known as Azriel Auerbach, is a prominent Haredi rabbi and posek. He is the son of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, and son-in-law of Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, two renowned poskim. He was considered Rabbi Elyashiv's right-hand man in matters of halakha.
Auerbach married Leah Elyashiv (1938–2010), daughter of Rabbi Elyashiv, in 1960. They had no children. On October 11, 2012, at the age of 75, Auerbach became engaged to Minna Elyashiv, age 58, the widow of Rabbi Avraham Elyashiv, grandson of Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv.
Rulings.
In matters of Halakhic dispute between Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and Rabbi Elyashiv, it would appear that Rabbi Ezriel Auerbach tends to rule privately in accordance with his father, while avoiding a public stand, in deference to his father-in-law.

Women's City Club

The Women's City Club is a women's club located at 2110 Park Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, within the Park Avenue Historic District. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979.
History.
Women's organizations became increasingly influential in the years after the American Civil War as a class of highly educated, middle class women arose in the nation. Their impact was at its peak in the years around World War I, when the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women's suffrage, was ratified. In Detroit, it became apparent at that time that the many women's organizations in the city needed a centralized place to meet. In 1919, a number of local activists founded the "Women's City Club" to "promote a broad acquaintance among women." The club hired architect William B. Stratton (husband of ceramicist and club member Mary Chase Perry Stratton) to design a suitable building.
Description.
The exterior of the building is built of brick, in a featureless modern style. The six stories are differentiated into the lower three floors, which are blocky and regular; and the three upper floors, which appear to be set onto the lower floors. The brick color differs between the two sections, as does the appearance of the windows. There is also a horizontal range of bricks between the two sections. The lower floors were designed to be meeting spaces for social events and planning the activities of members. The three upper floors were used as an apartments for women who moved to Detroit for employment and wished to live in a wholesome environment.
The interior decor was strongly influenced by the then-current Arts and Crafts movement, with hand-wrought ironwork and Pewabic Pottery tilework. The swimming pool was also decorated with Pewabic tile.
Use.
The City Club offered a number of classes and recreation programs for women, eventually enrolling over 8,000 members. However, membership declined after World War II, and in 1974 the club moved to smaller quarters. The social space was used for various purposes, including a restaurant and bar in later years. The building is currently owned by Forbes Management (also owners of the Elwood Bar, Gem Theater, and The Fillmore Detroit), and has recently received an upgrade of its façade.

Francesco Antonio Begnudelli-Basso

Francesco Antonio Begnudelli-Basso (born at Trento; died at Freising, 9 October 1713) was an Austrian canon lawyer.
Life.
From 1675 he was Vicar-General of the Diocese of Trent, his native place. In 1679, however, he held a canonry in Freising Cathedral, where also he became in 1696 vicar-general of the diocese, and where he died. 
Works.
His "Bibliotheca juris canonico-civilis practica seu repertoium quaestionum magis practicarum in utroque foro" established him among the canonists of his day. He speaks in the clearest terms of papal infallibility. The work was published in Freising in 1712, for vols. in folio; Geneva, 1747; Modena and Venice, 1758. It was made effectively obsolete by later editions of Lucius Ferraris's "Bibliotheca".

High Street Historic District (Wilmington, Massachusetts)

The High Street Historic District in Wilmington, Massachusetts is a residential historic district along High Street. The district runs east from High Street's junction with Salem Street (Massachusetts Route 62) to a sharp bend in the road where it meets the right-of-way for Interstate 93. Of the 17 contributing properties, all but four are located on the north side of the road (between numbers 8 and 72); the rest are on the south side (numbers 31, 47, 57 and 67). It represents a cluster of high quality houses built mainly in the second half of the 19th century, although there is one contributing property (a Cape style house at 58 High Street) built in 1942. The styling of these houses is diverse, with all of the popular revival styles of the period represented. Houses built in the 20th century are predominantly Colonial Revival or Craftsman/Bungalow in style.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Larrabee's Brick Block

Larrabee's Brick Block is a historic commercial and residential building at 500-504 Main Street in Melrose, Massachusetts. It is one of only two relatively unaltered 19th century commercial buildings in Melrose. The three story brick Second Empire building was built in 1880 by John Larrabee on the site of a wood frame meeting hall. The block is built of brick laid in stretcher bond, and its third floor is under a mansard rood typical of the style. The ground floor consists of two storefronts with recessed entrances and plate glass windows, and a separate recessed entrance giving access to the upper residential floors. The second floor facade has two projecting bay windows, decorated with brackets and panel trim, above the two store fronts, and a sash window above the the residential entrance. The mansard roof originally had single window dormers, but c. 1910 all but one of these (the one above the residential entrance) were removed and replaced by extensions of the second story bay windows.
The north elevation is also decorated with some elaboration, even though it faces a narrow passage. Windows on the second floor are topped by segmented arches and brick corbelled hoods, and the mansard roof is pierced by six dormers similar in style to the original one on the front. Windows on the south elevation are more simply styled, having only segmented arch lintels, and the cornice becomes simpler towards the rear of the building. The back elevation is also simply decorated, and is mostly obscured by a c. 1930s vernacular three-tier porch.
The interior of the building has also retained most of its original finishes. The ground floor shops have tin ceilings and walls, and original maple flooring, and the upper residential units retain much of the original woodwork, including fireplace mantels, wainscoting, and molded door and window surrounds.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Down Low (rap group)

Down Low is a rap group formed in Kaiserslautern, Germany, in 1995 by Joe Thompson and Darren Tucker. The group is known for hits like "Johnny B." Down Low are considered as one of the first groups to bring hip-hop music in a European style in the middle of the 1990s together with artists such as C-Block, Nana and A.K. S.W.I.F.T.
History.
The group was formed in December 1995 in the K-Town studios in Kaiserslautern. The members were rapper Joe Thompson, who served in the U.S. Army during Operation Desert Storm and had a friendship with Rod. D from Fun Factory, as well as singer Darren Tucker. The first single "Don't Look Any Further", a hip-hop version of the song of the same name of the M People received no attention; the second song "Vision of Life", however, became a hit in several European countries in the middle of 1996.
Shortly after the publication of "Vision of Life", Tucker had to leave the group due to disputes with his manager. He was replaced by Mike Dalien. The album "Visions" and the singles "Murder" over the case of O. J. Simpson, "Potion" and "Lovething/We Do It Like That" followed soon. Together with Flip Da Scrip, the group produced the song "Nothing Like Viva" as a hymn on the German music-television channel VIVA under the project name "Hip Hop Alliance".
A second album, "It Ain't Over", followed at the end of 1997. The song "Johnny B.", a cover version of The Hooters, became the group's largest hit and climbed to number four in the German single charts. Radio NRJ distinguished Down Low as the best rap act in 1997.
In the spring of 1998, the group created "Rapper Against Racism" in order to promote talented new singers and rappers (La Mazz, Trooper Da Don, Jay Supreme and others) and point a spot on racism still present in Germany at that time.
In the autumn of 1998 the group released the album "Third Dimension". The single "Once Upon A Time" could tie to past successes; the probably saddest song of the group contained elements from the music by Ennio Morricone for the epic spaghetti-Western film "Once Upon a Time in the West" (1968). With the song "H.I.V.", one drew the attention of the dangers of the AIDS virus.
After the publication of a greatest-hits album, the gorup took a break for 1½ years. In 2001, the fourth album, "The 4th Level", which was clearly an R&B-album, was released. Dalien left the group because of musical differences in 2001 at the beginning of the work on "The 4th Level". His successor became Erick "Rick" Lamont Smith, who had already co-operated in the past with the group and had published some singles under the name La Mazz and Dressman. Since the German public had lost the interest in European rap in the meantime, the group could celebrate no further success in Germany. In 2002, the record company published a remix of "Murder" with samples of the rapper Warren G.
In 2003, the group released a DVD, "Visions – The Singles 1997–2003". In the autumn of 2003, the single "Living In The Ghetto" appeared. The publication was, however, a single-handed attempt of the record company; the artists experienced only later of it, and for the lack of promotion the song found no commercial attention, but nevertheless became a club hit. Thompson accused SHIFT Music later of cannabalizing the group from money scarcities.
For 2004, an album, "Down Low V / Adrenaline", was announced. But since the new style of the group did not please the record company, the album was not published. For a while it looked like as if the artists would possibly close a contract with a new label in the United States, for legal reasons probably under a new project name. However, in April 2005 Thompson announced that the group had settled the controversy with SHIFT and would work on new material again. The first song "Every Day (MMMM)" of the album "Return of The Trendsetter" was released 27 October 2006.
2010 was to be the come back of Dalien in the group. It planned a new album in the end of 2010. That was later revised to be a released in late 2012.

Indiana Code

The Indiana Code is the code of laws for the U.S. state of Indiana. The contents are the codification of the all the laws currently in effect within Indiana. First codified in 1824, it has been updated almost every year since then and is maintained and updated by the Office of Code Revision.
Organization.
The laws of Indiana were first codified in 1823 by Governor William Hendricks, who owned a printing press, and at the request of the Indiana General Assembly used it to print all of the state′s laws, which he codified before printing. His codification and the printing was officially adopted in 1824. The code had its first major reorganization in 1841 by Governor Samuel Bigger, a prominent lawyer in the state, who, at the request of the General Assembly, reorganized the code and rewrote many sections for better legal application.
The code has been revised almost every year since then, with the General Assembly specifying which clauses are to be altered in the bills they pass. The code is currently (as of 2013) made up of thirty-six titles, three of which have been repealed, with each title being subdivided into articles, chapters, sections, and clauses. The code is maintained by the Office of Code Revision, that is part of the Indiana Legislative Services Agency. In total there are over thirteen-thousand clauses in the code that govern everything by state law from the design of the flag of Indiana, the method of holding elections, to the exact border with Kentucky.

Dil Bole Hadippa!

Dil Bole Hadippa! ("Heart Says Hurray!") is a 2009 Bollywood film directed by Anurag Singh and produced by Aditya Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner. It stars Shahid Kapoor and Rani Mukerji in pivotal roles in the story about a young woman who pretends to be a man to join an all-male cricket team. It also has Anupam Kher, Dalip Tahil, Rakhi Sawant and Sherlyn Chopra in supporting roles. The film released on 18 September 2009, and received negative reviews upon release, and was a box office disappointment. It is a remake of the 2006 Hollywood film "She's the Man".
Plot.
Veera (Rani Mukerji) is a young woman who lives in a small village but dreams of playing cricket in the big league, being extremely talented in the game. Veera works in a nautanki and dances with the star performer, Shanno (Rakhi Sawant), an arrogant and conceited woman.
Rohan (Shahid Kapoor) is an accomplished captain of a county cricket team in England. His father, Vicky, and mother, Yamini, are separated. Rohan lives with his mother in England and his father lives in India. Vicky has been captaining the Indian cricket team against the Pakistani cricket team in a tournament called the 'Aman Cup.' Every year, for 8 years, India has lost all matches. To win, Vicky pretends to have a heart attack and asks Rohan to come to India. When Rohan reaches India, he agrees to captain the team for his father, determined to make the team win.
Rohan holds auditions to select the best players, but when Veera goes to audition, she is not allowed to enter because players have to be male. Upset, Veera then disguises herself as a man named Veer and is accepted into the team. One day when a glass of juice is thrown in Veera's face, her hair falls, but she hides it and runs to the men's changing room. Rohan looks for "Veer", but finds Veera in the changing room instead. Veera quickly pretends to be Veer's sister to cover the disguise. Rohan argues with her but later asks "Veer" to bring him to Veera to apologise. Rohan falls in love with Veera as herself (he does not recognise her as Veer). Rohan and Veera go on a date and Veera falls in love with Rohan as well.
The big day of the match arrives, when India is set to play Pakistan in Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium. Rohan's mother arrives at the match and she and Rohan's father are reunited. In the match, Veer gets the other player out and everyone hugs her in joy. In the excitement, one of Veer's brown contact lenses falls out onto Rohan's finger and he realises that Veer is Veera. He argues with her about her deception and goes back to play the match without "Veer". Upset, Veer takes off her disguise, changing back to herself. When Rohan's team starts losing, Vicky tells Rohan that it isn't important to win or lose any more; he is happy that at least through the match, he and his mother came. But Rohan understands how badly his father wants to win this match, so he gets Veera to come back and play the match.
Veera puts her disguise back on and plays well, but in the closing stages, she is tripped by a Pakistan fielder. Rohan rushes to her aid and the medical unit says that Veera's arm is fractured, but she determinedly continues playing. She shows her talent by switching sides and batting with her left hand. They win the match and Rohan asks "Veer" to show his true identity. Everyone is shocked that Veer is actually a woman and accuses her of being a cheat. Veera then gives a heart-touching speech about women and their talents that become useless because of men's dominance. Everybody realises that talented women should be allowed to play with men in cricket teams and gives her a round of significant applause. Veera sees Rohan's love for her and the two are reunited.
Production.
Filming began on 17 July 2008. Shahid Kapoor's portions were shot in February 2009, since he was shooting for Kaminey from June to December 2008. Urmila Matondkar was initially offered to play a cameo role in the film but she eventually opted out of the project. Sanjay Leela Bhansali had already bought rights for the title "Hadippa". When Yash Raj Films requested him to give them rights for the title, Bhansali refused. Later, it was announced that the movie title would be "Dil Bole Hadippa".
Box office.
"Dil Bole Hadippa"'s domestic net collections were 11.50 crore for its opening weekend. It went on to collect a net of 23.7 crore, and was declared "Flop" by Box office India.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of "Dil Bole Hadippa" had been composed by Pritam with lyrics provided by Jaideep Sahni. The melody composition for the track "Ishq Hi Hai Rab" was composed by Mukhtar Sahota, a United Kingdom-based Music Director.
