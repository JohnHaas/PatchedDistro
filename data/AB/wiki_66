Low-Light (G.I. Joe)

Low-Light (also released as "Low Light") is a fictional character from the toyline, comic books and animated series. He served as the G.I. Joe Team's Infantryman and debuted in 1986.
Profile.
His real name is Cooper G. MacBride, and his rank is that of Staff Sergeant E-6. Low-Light was born in Crosby, North Dakota. 
As a child, Low-Light was afraid of the dark, timid with wild animals, and shy of loud noises, until one hunting expedition with his father. He lost his way in the impenetrable darkness, and was found three weeks later, with his flashlight, .22 rifle, and a grin from ear to ear. Ten years later, he was an instructor at the Army Marksmanship Program in Fort Benning and a self-taught expert on image intensification.
Hasbro Toy.
Low-Light was first released as an action figure in 1986. Overall, he has had 8 releases, using a total of 5 unique molds. Just as his serial number has changed with each release, so has his actual appearance. For his original figure and 1989 repaint as part of the Slaughter's Marauders line, he was shown to have curly blond hair, with no facial hair. For his third release (1991), he had short, straight, black hair, and a full beard. His fourth release (1993) as part of the Dino Hunters line was a repaint of his third release, and this time he had blond hair and beard. His fifth release was again a repaint of his third release, and again featured black hair and beard. His sixth (2006), seventh (2008), and eighth (2011) releases were done as a homage to his original release, as all three versions show him with blond hair and no beard. All versions include some visor (either red or blue) over his eyes.

Devil's Due comics.
In the Devil's Due 'Frontline' series, Low-Light makes a cameo during an investigation of the murder of a Crimson Guard. Low-Light is unsure as to why G.I. Joe should care, as evidence points to another Cobra agent as the killer.
Low-Light, Recondo, Ripcord, Dart and Tunnel Rat are caught in an artificial conflict created by Iron Grenadiers in the fictional country of Sierra Gordo. Low-Light is injured in a mortar explosion but makes it out alive.
Low-Light is also one of the reservists that is called into action in New York City to stop Neurotoxin. The team is successful in stopping Neurotixin, and Low-Light again shows off his night fighting ability. After this, he goes back into reserve status until World War III.

Westfield Municipal Building

Westfield Municipal Building is a historic building at 59 Court Street in Westfield, Massachusetts. It presently houses the Westfield city offices and the local district court. It was built in 1889 to house the state normal school (now Westfield State University), serving in that role until its acquisition by the city in 1959. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Hartwell and Richardson. The second partner was William Cummings Richardson, not H. H. Richardson, but the design of this building, only a few years after the latter's death, was strongly influenced by his distinctive style.
The building has an L shape, with a front facade of . The main block is deep, and the ell extending off the east side is deep. It rests on a granite foundation, and is made of red brick with brownstone trim. There are two entrances on the front facade, each under classic Richardsonian arches, with additional entrances on the east side and the rear. In its first use as a training school, the first floor included a reception area, science classrooms, and training classrooms for elementary grades. The second floor housed a study hall and assembly hall capable of holding the whole student population (about 175), as well as the principal's office, science laboratories, other classrooms, and studio space for artistic disciplines. There was a gymnasium in the basement.
The exterior of the building received only modest modifications when the city took over the building in 1959, although it was extensively remodeled inside. Two brick additions were added, one on the east side as vault space, and the other on the north side for storage. The entrance formerly used by the school now serves as the district court entrance, providing access to the clerk's office, a courtroom, and probation offices. The remainder of the building has been converted for the use of a number of city departments.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and as part of an expanded Westfield Center Historic District in 2013.

Aditya Mehta

Aditya Mehta (b. Maharashtra, 31 October 1985) is an Indian professional snooker player. In 2013, he became the first Indian to reach the final of a ranking tournament at his home event, the Indian Open.
Career.
Early career.
Mehta began his professional career by playing Challenge Tour in 2004, at the time the second-level professional tour. He was nominated for a Main Tour place for the 2008/2009 season. He was the first Indian to play on Main Tour since Yasin Merchant did in the 1990s. He fell off the tour at the end of the season but regained a place for the 2011/2012 season due to being awarded the Asian nomination. Aditya won a Silver and a Bronze medal in Men's Snooker Team and Men's Snooker Singles respectively, at the 2010 Asian Games held in Guangzhou, China.
2011/2012 season.
In the 2011/2012 season Mehta would need to win four qualifying matches to reach the main draws of all ranking events. He came closest to doing so in the second event of the season, the Shanghai Masters. Mehta beat Stuart Carrington 5–0, Rod Lawler and Jamie Jones both 5–4, before losing to former world number 6 Ryan Day 2–5. He played in 10 of the 12 minor ranking PTC Events, with his best result coming in Event 9 where he beat two-time World Championship runner-up Matthew Stevens 4–3 in the last 16, but then lost to Martin Gould 1–4 in the quarter-finals. In April, Mehta won the 2012 Asian Snooker Championship with a 7–5 victory over compatriot Pankaj Advani. He finished the snooker season ranked world number 80 and therefore out of the top 64 who retain their places for the next season, however, due to his recent win he earned a spot on the tour for the 2012/2013 season.
2012/2013 season.
Mehta started the season by almost qualifying for the first tournament of the season, the Wuxi Classic. He beat Sam Baird 5–3, James Wattana and Jimmy White both 5–1, but then lost out to Jamie Cope 4–5 in the final round. He also lost in the final qualifying round for the Shanghai Masters following a 3–5 defeat to Mark King. In the last round he gained revenge over Jamie Cope following his loss at the same stage in the Wuxi Classic, by triumphing 6–4 to seal his place at the event in Chengdu, China, in October. In his first televised match in a major ranking tournament Mehta was outclassed by his opponent as he lost 0–6. However, his run in the tournament matched the best performance by an Indian player in a ranking event set by Yasin Merchant over two decades earlier. The rest of the season was quiet for Mehta as he could not qualify for another event, with his year ending in the second round of World Championship Qualifying, following a 9–10 loss to Alan McManus. He finished the season ranked world number 73.
2013/2014 season.
In July 2013, Mehta won the World Games by beating Liang Wenbo 3–0 in the final to become the first Indian to win the gold medal. The 2013/2014 season saw the introduction of a ranking event held in India for the first time. Mehta qualified for it by seeing off Xiao Guodong 4–2. In the first round of the event held in New Delhi he made a break of 127 in the deciding frame against Peter Ebdon to win 4–3 and then beat Hammad Miah 4–1 to reach the last 16 of a ranking event for the second time in his career. Mehta defeated two-time world champion Mark Williams 4–2 to face compatriot Pankaj Advani in the quarter-finals in an iconic match in Indian snooker as the winner would be the first semi-finalist of a ranking event in the country's history. In a match heavily bound in tactical play it was Mehta who triumphed with a 4–3 win. His remarkable run continued as he held his nerve from 3–0 up against Stephen Maguire to edge through 4–3 and reach the final. His tournament came to an abrupt end, however, as he lost 5–0 to Ding Junhui but he did earn a cheque of £25,000 as the tournament's runner-up.

The Adsit Log Cabin in Willsboro, New York was built by Samuel Adsit in 1778 and is believed to be one of the oldest log cabins in the United States that still exists in its original location. Adsit was an American Revolutionary War veteran and he built the cabin for his family of sixteen when he moved to Willsboro Point following the war. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1992. 
It is believed that the house survived due to its eventual containment within a larger structure, which was later torn down.

John Herbert (Secretary of State)

Sir John Herbert (1550 – 9 July 1617) was a Welsh lawyer, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1586 and 1611. He was Secretary of State under Elizabeth I and James I.
Life.
Herbert was the son of Matthew Herbert of Swansea and was descended from an illegitimate son of William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. Herbert may have been educated at Christ Church, Oxford, although this is questioned. He was admitted an honorary member of the College of Doctors of Laws in November 1573 and awarded MA. He was a commissioner of the High Court of Admiralty from 1575 to 1584 (with David Lewis) and Master of Requests from 1586 to 1601 (with William Aubrey from 1590). Queen Elizabeth appointed him secretary to the Council of the North and Keeper of Signet.
In 1586, Herbert was elected Member of Parliament for Grampound. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law by the University of Oxford in 1587. In 1588, he was elected MP for Gatton. He was elected MP for Christchurch in 1593 and MP for Bodmin in 1597. In April 1600, he was appointed second Secretary of State and a member of the Privy Council. In 1601 he was elected MP for Glamorgan and for Wallingford and chose to sit for Glamorgan. He was knighted in 1602. In 1604 he was elected MP for Monmouthshire and sat until 1611. He was High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1605.
Herbert was a talented linguist (not just speaking English and Welsh) and so was used to interrogate foreign prisoners and on trade and political missions to Denmark, Poland, Brandenburg, the Netherlands and France. He continued in office under James I, although James preferred to use unofficial secretaries such as Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke. When Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury died in 1612, Herbert hoped to succeed him as principal secretary of state, but James I left the office vacant until 1614. He was thereafter Secretary of State in name only.
Herbert was of Neath Abbey. He died in Cardiff aged 67 on 9 July 1617, having fought a duel with Sir Lewis Tresham two months earlier.
Herbert married Margaret Morgan, daughter of William Morgan of Cefn Coch.

Jack Wilson (rower)

John Hyrne Tucker Wilson, known as Jack Wilson (17 September 1914-16 February 1997), was a British rowing champion and Olympic gold medallist. 
Jack Wilson was born in Bristol, Rhode Island to British parents, and was educated in Texas and Shrewsbury School, Shropshire, England before attending Pembroke College at the University of Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he rowed in three successive Boat Races (1934–36) in which Cambridge defeated Oxford. During the 1935 and 1936 races, he rowed alongside Ran Laurie, who became his rowing partner after Cambridge and a lifelong friend. 
After graduating from University, Wilson took a post as a District Commissioner with the Sudan Political Service, missing an opportunity to participate alongside Laurie in Britain’s Eights boat at the 1936 Olympics. With Laurie joining the Sudan Political Service the following year, the two men joined forces in rowing and, while on leave from colonial service in 1938, won the Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta. 
Both Wilson and Laurie returned to Sudan following their success, and continued to serve in the Sudan Political Service through the Second World War. In 1946, Wilson survived an attack by a local woman in Sudan who threw an assegai spear at him. 
In 1948 Wilson and Laurie returned to Henley and once again won the Silver Goblets, having had little training and no opportunity to row since their success in the event ten years earlier. This was followed later that year by an Olympic gold medal, once again rowing at Henley. 
Wilson retired from colonial service in 1954 and worked for the British Steel Corporation. He died in 1997, aged 82.

In 1925, with the decline in demand for whips occasioned by the success of the automobile, Van Deusen converted the factory to the production of lawn swings. He died in 1930, and his son lost many of his inherited assets during the Great Depression. The factory was acquired by Stanley Home Products, which used it as its corporate headquarters into the 1960s. In the 1980s it was acquired by a developer and converted to apartments.

Eliza Bisbee Duffey

Eliza Bisbee Duffey was an American feminist and writer of the 19th century. She published several books in defense of women's rights.
She entered a controversy with physician Edward Clarke, who believed women should be educated separately from men at Universities, claiming common education would be dangerous for the "mental and physical health of women", in her book "No Sex In Education; Or, An Equal Chance for Both Boys and Girls" (1874), where she argued for the equal and co-education of both genders.
Eliza Bisbee Duffey also authored books about women's health and physical and sexual education, "What Women Should Know" (1873) and "The Relations of the Sexes" (1876).
Like most feminists of her time, she also opposed firmly abortion as a crime. In "The Relations of the Sexes", she states that "The act of abortion which I had hitherto regarded as a trivial thing, at once became in my eyes the grossest misdemeanor—nay, the most aggravated crime. Being guided by this experience, I judge that this offence is perpetrated by women who are totally ignorant of the laws of their being. Consequently, the surest preventative against this crime will be a thorough teaching to women, even before marriage, of the physiology, hygiene, duties and obligations of maternity."
She also acknowledge the human nature of the unborn, in the same study : "From the moment of conception, the embryo is a living thing, leading a distinct, separate existence from the mother, though closely bound to her. From almost the earliest stage, the form of the future being is indicated, and it has separate heart-beats, distinctly perceptible through the intervening tissues of the mother’s body, which cover it. It is a human being to all intents and purposes. The period called quickening is a merely fictitious period, which does not indicate the first motion of the embryo. These first motions are not usually detected… until they have acquired considerable force."

The program includes classes in video, filmmaking, photography, computer graphic arts, and new media, with courses providing a review of fundamentals of the craft, overview of aesthetics, and surveys of contemporary work, trends, and ideas, as well as giving students an opportunity to use professional equipment and facilities. Students work on a number of projects, both individually and collaboratively, throughout the four weeks of the program. While the curriculum stresses creative production, it is not exclusively goal-oriented. Exploration, experimentation, and discovery are stressed in each project. The program culminates with a final show and screening.
Orchestral studies.
The School of Orchestral Studies takes place at Skidmore College, and is cosponsored by the New York State School Music Association, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. Students are offered classes in history, literature, and theory of music, in addition to daily rehearsals. In addition to the full orchestra, a string orchestra and a wind ensemble, as well as other small ensembles, are available for students to perform in. Over the course of the program students participate in a number of performances, including shows in the Empire Plaza in front of the state capital and at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. The program's repertoire is arranged in conjunction to the Philadelphia Orchestra's summer repertoire and many of the small ensembles give concerts before the Philadelphia Orchestra's SPAC performances.
Theatre.
The School of Theatre takes place over 4 weeks during July at Adelphi University. Students are given daily courses in improvisation, movement, voice and scene study. Guest artists and performers also provide master classes, readings, and workshops in diverse areas, such as stage combat, comedy and improvisation, mask, play writing, and directing. Students are also taken on field trips to New York City to see on and off-Broadway plays. In addition to their rigorous course load, students write and direct plays, as well as perform in fellow students’ work.
The School of Theatre is a summer intensive conservatory program. The students take six hours of rigorous classes daily and attend nightly workshops for 3 hours, along with assigned reading and out of class homework assignments. Much of voice and movement study is rooted in the Alexander technique. The scene study curriculum leads a daily hour and a half Meisner technique class that delves into the process of repetition, eventually applying activities, given circumstances, and eventually scene work. The Improvisation class derives from Stanislavsky teachings, Michael Chekhov work. Students are required to read Stanislavsky's book An Actor Prepares, as well as William Esper's book, The Actor's Art and Craft. This advanced acting training is usually unavailable for adolescent actors, and typically not for such a low tuition ($2000).
Admission to the School of Theatre is by a competitive audition. 30 students are selected to participate. The audition consists of two contrasting monologues and an interview.
Visual arts.
The School of the Arts takes place at SUNY Fredonia during the month of July, where students work in the studio with drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, mixed media, figure, and inter-disciplinary arts under the direction of noted exhibiting artists/educators. Related activities include drawing and painting from a live model, trips to farms and lakes in the area, and experience with art processes that include welding, casting, direct carving, modeling life-size objects in clay, and experimenting with a variety of printmaking techniques. Group critiques and discussions of student work provide feedback throughout the program.
History.
The New York State Summer School of the Arts was established in 1971, under Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, opening with the Orchestral Studies program. In 1976 the School was expanded with the addition of Ballet, Choral, Theater, Media Arts, and Visual Arts programs. NYSSSA was expanded further in 1988 with the Dance and Jazz programs.
Application.
Placement in the schools is reserved for New York State residents who meet the selection criteria. If there are remaining openings after this selection, they may be filled by out-of-state students who meet additional criteria. Students must be enrolled in grades 8 through 12 and students must audition for the NYSSSA School they wish to attend. This audition is completed in person at a regional audition site, through a portfolio review, or in certain instances, through a video or audiotape review.
Tuition for the schools is $2,100 which includes, room, board and classes and artistic events for the four week residential program. State funds keep these tuitions considerably lower than the actual program costs.
Students are selected for the NYSSSA schools without regard to their financial need and tuition assistance forms are mailed to each student who is offered acceptance or alternate status for each program. NYSSSA awards financial assistance based upon individual need, but is limited to New York State residents only. Auditions are held throughout the state.

Ida Odinga, the wife of Kenya’s Prime Minister, spoke at the festival in London that year and praised an earlier festival held in her country.
A November 2008 festival in Roxas City in the Philippines was criticized by the Catholic Church but supported by local business people. The president of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou spoke at the festival which was held in Taipei October 31, 2009. He addressed the importance of freedom, democracy and peace; and said that his government was a "peace maker."
A Global Peace Convention, sponsored by the GPF, was held in November, 2010 in Kenya. Among the speakers was Kenya's president, Mwai Kibaki. The South Asia Regional Level Global Peace Festival was held in Nepal from 30 September to 2 October 2010. In 2012 the GPF held its annual convention in Atlanta, Georgia.

Wilhelm Lamormaini

Wilhelm Germain Lamormaini (29 December 1570 – 22 February 1648) was a Jesuit theologian, and an influential figure as confessor of the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand II during the Thirty Years' War.
Life.
Lamormaini was born near Dochamps in the Duchy of Luxembourg (nowadays part of Manhay in the Belgian Luxembourg province), since 1482 part of the Habsburg Netherlands. His father, Everard Germain, was a farmer at the hamlet of Lamormenil, hence the name. Lamormaini studied first at the Jesuit gymnasium of Trier, and thence went to Prague, where he received his doctor's degree, and in 1590 entered the Jesuit Order in Brno. Ordained priest at Bratislava in 1596 and afterwards working as a teacher in Žilina and Prague, he was called to the Jesuit University of Graz in Styria as professor of philosophy in 1600, became professor of theology in 1606, and in 1614 was appointed rector of the college. His strong Catholic manners attracted Archduke Ferdinand II of Inner Austria, then residing at Graz Castle.
Between the years 1621 and 1623 he stayed in Rome, but became in the latter year rector of the Jesuit college merged with the University of Vienna, and in 1637 rector of the academic college. From 1643 to 1645 he was provincial of the Austrian province of the Jesuit order, but was compelled to relinquish this office on account of his gout, which made his visitations a task of the greatest difficulty. During the last years of his life, he established a seminary for poor students in Vienna, the "Ignatius- und Franciskus-Seminarium für Stipendisten".
Father Confessor.
After the death of his fellow Jesuit Martin Becan in 1624, he became the confessor of Ferdinand II, and as such his name appears in the political affairs of the time. As counselor of the emperor, his enemies affirmed that it was not Ferdinand, but the Jesuits who ruled the empire. He was an instransigent proponent of the Counter-Reformation, and when the Protestant princes of the Empire were compelled by the 1629 Edict of Restitution to give up all former ecclesiastical property seized from the Catholic Church, Lamormaini was influential in having it used for the propagation of the Catholic faith. However, these measures met with opposition even by the Catholic estates and ultimately enfeebled the Imperial authority.
Having unsuccessfully tried to restrain Ferdinand from antagonizing the French by interfering in the War of the Mantuan Succession, Lamormaini was placed in an unpleasant position when the Spaniards accused him of espousing the cause of their enemies, and tried to have him banished from court. But Lamormaini was able to vindicate himself. His concerns became real, when the French Cardinal Richelieu abandoned the common Catholic cause and had the Treaty of Bärwalde signed with the Swedish Empire in 1631. Lamormaini also took part in the proceedings against the emperor's removed generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein in January 1634.
Lamormaini's rise ended with the emperor's death in 1637. He was offered a large sum by the Senate of Hamburg in recognition of his services on the occasion of the election of Ferdinand III as King of the Romans. The city of Augsburg, in gratitude for the services he had rendered to it, erected a costly altar in the church of the Viennese Novitiate. He died at Vienna.
By his advice many Jesuit institutions were established in the empire. He took a leading part in the Counter-Reformation in the Habsburg lands of Austria, Styria, Bohemia, and Moravia.
Works.
Only a part of the biography of Ferdinand II upon which Lamormaini labored appeared, "Ferdinand II, Romanorum Imperatoris, Virtutes" (1638); this was republished frequently, and in different languages.

City Hall (Chicopee, Massachusetts)

City Hall is a historic city hall in Chicopee, Massachusetts. Located in the heart of Chicopee at Market Square, the building (built 1871) is a strongly Italianate structure, with a tower modeled on that of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy. It was designed by Charles Edward Parker.
History and architecture.
Chicopee purchased land from the Ames Manufacturing Company in 1869 as a site for its new city hall, and a committee of leading citizens was established to oversee its design and construction. The committee selected Charles E. Parker of Boston to design the new building, and construction took place in 1871. Parker's design was modelled on the Palazzo Vecchio, the historic town hall of Florence in Italy; the building was dedicated on December 21, 1871.
By far the most prominent feature of the building is its tower, which echoes that of its Florentine inspiration, and is topped by a golden eagle statue weighing and sporting a wingspan. The tower houses a bell, which was historically used on public occasions and to announce fire alarms. A clock mechanism was added in 1888, with faces on three of the tower's four sides.
The building continues to be used for city offices. The police station was originally located in the basement, but was moved in 1929 to a newly constructed annex.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

A pseudofracture is a diagnostic form of osteomalacia.
Structure.
A band of bone material of decreased density may form alongside the surface of the bone. Thickening of the periosteum occurs. The formation of callouses in the affected area is also common. This gives the appearance of a false fracture. Typical sites of involvement are the axillary margins of the scapula, ribs, pubic rami, proximal ends of the femur and ulna. a lucent line about 1 –2 cm wide vertical to the cortex ..all the changes have unclear border.

The Colonial Block is a historic mixed-use retail, commercial, and residential block at 1139-55 Main Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. The building was built as a speculative venture in 1902 by a local builder and real estate developer, Pascal Morse. The five story building is a relatively rare example of a mixed use building from the period built to provide a mix of uses, in particular residential, at a time when most building in the area were built for commercial and retail purposes. Its first floor was for built for retail use, the second floor housed offices and commercial space, and the upper three floors were residential. The building marked a transitional area between the urban downtown center of Springfield to the north, and more residential areas to the south. It also features distinctive Georgian Revival details not found on many other Springfield buildings.

Norman E. Rosenthal

Norman E. Rosenthal is a South African, author, psychiatrist and scientist who in the 1980s first described winter depression or seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and pioneered the use of light therapy for its treatment. 
Rosenthal was born and educated in South Africa and moved to the United States to complete his medical training. He established a private practice and spent 20 years as a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) where he studied the disorders of mood, sleep, and biological rhythms. 
Rosenthal’s research with SAD led him to write “Winter Blues” and two other books on the topic. More recently Rosenthal has written a book on the Transcendental Meditation technique and conducted research on its potential influence on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In total, he has written eight books, including one on the topic of jet lag, and published 200 scholarly papers.
Early life and education.
Rosenthal (b. 1950) was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa. He received his M.B. B.Ch. (equivalent of an M.D.) from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and completed an internship in Internal Medicine and Surgery at Johannesburg General Hospital. He moved to the United States to further his education as a resident, and then became Chief Resident in psychiatry at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.
Career.
Rosenthal began a private practice in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. in 1979. At the same time, he began a research fellowship with Frederick Goodwin at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. This was the beginning of a 20 year career with the NIMH as a Researcher, Research Fellow, and Senior Researcher. Rosenthal became the director of seasonal studies at the institute and in 1985, led research with 160 participants on the effects of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and later studied the psycho-physiological phenomena of "spring fever".
Rosenthal co-authored the book, "How to Beat Jet Lag" in 1993 and in 1998, he was named clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown Medical School. He became the Medical Director of Capital Clinical Research Associates in Rockville, Maryland in 2001 and is currently its CEO. He received a special recognition award from the Society for Light Treatment & Biological Rhythms (SLBTR) in 1999 and published the book "The Emotional Revolution: How the New Science of Feeling Can Transform Your Life" in 2002.
Early in his career, Rosenthal learned the Transcendental Meditation technique while in South Africa, but found that as a medical student and a medical resident he didn't have time to practice. Then 35 years later, after one of his patients had a dramatic improvement as a result of TM, he began practicing again and then began recommending it to his patients. In 2011, he published "", which debuted at number seven on the New York Times' Best Sellers: Hardcover Advice, How-To And Miscellaneous list. Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Rosenthal has written more than 200 scholarly publications and his writings have been featured in the "American Journal of Psychiatry", "Psychiatry Research", "Archives of General Psychiatry", "Biological Psychiatry", "Molecular Psychiatry", and "Journal of Affective Disorders". He continues to conduct research on pediatric and adolescent SAD, pharmaceutical treatments for SAD and the effects of light therapy on seasonal bipolar disorder and circadian rhythms. He is often cited in mainstream media as an expert on the topic of SAD. 
According to his web site, Rosenthal has received the A.P.A. New York District Branch prize for paper written by a resident, the Psychiatric Institute Alumni Prize for best research performed by Psychiatric Institute Resident, the Public Health Service Commendation Medal, the Anna Monika Foundation Award for Depression Research, the Public Health Service Outstanding Service Award.
Seasonal affective disorder.
Rosenthal is referred to as the pioneer of research into seasonal affective disorder. In 1984, he coined the term and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. Rosenthal’s interest in studying the effects of the seasons on mood changes emerged when he emigrated from the mild climate of Johannesburg, South Africa, to the northeastern USA. As a resident in the psychiatry program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he noticed that he was more energetic and productive during the long days of summer versus the shorter darker days of the winter.
In 1980, his team at NIMH admitted a patient with depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night may be able to help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in someways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered. 
Rosenthal has written three books on the topic of SAD; "Seasonal Affective Disorders and Phototherapy" (1989), "Seasons of the Mind: Why You Get the Winter Blues and What You Can Do About It" (1989) and "Winter Blues" (2005). As a result of his research and publications, "it is now widely acknowledged that winter depression has a sound medical basis, involving changes in the body's mood centers" associated with exposure to light. Rosenthal later identified a form of reverse SAD which some experience in the summer season.

Habbush letter

The Habbush letter, or Habbush memo, is a handwritten message dated July 1, 2001, which appears to show a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq's government. It purports to be a direct communication between the head of Iraqi Intelligence, General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, to Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, outlining mission training which Mohamed Atta, one of the organizers of the September 11 attacks, supposedly received in Iraq. The letter also claims that Hussein accepted a shipment from Niger, an apparent reference to an alleged uranium acquisition attempt that U.S. President George W. Bush cited in his January 2003 State of the Union address.
The letter has been widely considered a fabrication since it was first made public in December 2003. In 2008, journalist Ron Suskind claimed that the forgery had been created by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), under the direction of the White House. Two of Suskind's sources denied having knowledge of anyone in their chain of command ordering the forging the letter. Former CIA officer Philip Giraldi alleged that the Pentagon was behind the forgery. The controversy that erupted as a result of Suskind's allegations led to an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee.
Background.
On December 13, 2003, the day of Saddam Hussein's capture by US forces, "The Daily Telegraph" of London ran a front-page story that not only claimed Saddam Hussein had trained one of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks, but also that his government, assisted by a "small team from the Al Qaeda organization", was expecting to receive a suspicious consignment from the country of Niger. This exclusive article, and a second piece, were both written by Con Coughlin, executive foreign editor to the paper.
Coughlin's information came from a secret intelligence memorandum, purportedly handwritten during Saddam Hussein's final days in power and discovered later by the newly-formed Iraqi Interim Government, which summarized an operational relationship between Mohamed Atta, a known associate of al-Qaeda and one of the hijackers in the aforementioned attacks, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS). The letter was signed by General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, chief of IIS, and directed to the President of Iraq. Coughlin said that he had received this document from a "senior member of the Iraqi interim government", though this person "declined to reveal where and how they obtained it."
Content.
Habbush's July 1, 2001, letter is labeled "Intelligence Items" and is addressed: "To the President of the Ba'ath Revolution Party and President of the Republic, may God protect you." It continues:
Initial reaction to the letter.
Ayad Allawi, interim Prime Minister of Iraq, was quoted in the original report, offering personal assurance over the document's authenticity: "We are uncovering evidence all the time of Saddam's involvement with al-Qaeda... But this is the most compelling piece of evidence that we have found so far. It shows that not only did Saddam have contacts with al-Qaeda, he had contact with those responsible for the September 11 attacks."
The story was quickly picked up and repeated by several conservative columnists in the US, including syndicated columnist Deroy Murdock and William Safire. Safire talked about the document in an op-ed for the "New York Times", claiming Saddam had attempted to cover-up his links to 9/11 by assassinating Abu Nidal, who the letter claims was with Mohammed Atta in Iraq. Stephen F. Hayes, a staunch proponent of Mohamed Atta's alleged Prague connection, ignored the letter entirely.
Three weeks later, in an interview with the "Rocky Mountain News", Vice President Dick Cheney spoke more broadly on Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations:
Doubts.
On December 17, 2003, a "Newsweek" article titled "Terror Watch: Dubious Link Between Atta And Saddam", by Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball, outlined some of the main reasons to doubt the authenticity of the letter:
The article also quoted an Iraq document expert named Hassan Mneimneh, as well as unnamed "US officials", who claim that the document was probably part of "a thriving new trade in dubious Iraqi documents".
Origin.
Ron Suskind's allegation.
Ron Suskind, in his 2008 book "The Way of the World", claimed that the Habbush letter had been forged by the White House, with the co-operation of senior CIA officials, including Robert Richer, the Associate Deputy Director of Operations . The letter was intended to be used as evidence of a link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, thereby further justifying the invasion of Iraq.
Suskind goes on to describe what he believes happened next: Richer spoke to John Maguire, a CIA Iraq expert, who said that this plan would not work, as Habbush would not sign anything himself because the insurgency would harm his family. This, by Suskind's account, led to the White House telling the CIA to hand-write the letter itself. Suskind's book says that this new order was eventually passed down to the Iraq Operations Group, who carried it out. Maguire left for Baghdad to help run the CIA station there and was not involved directly in the mission, other than discussing the mission with Richer.
Suskind also contends that Habbush, who still carries a $1 million reward for his capture, was secretly resettled in Jordan by the CIA with $5 million in US taxpayers' money.
Suskind claimed to have held tape-recorded interviews with Richer, Maguire, and Nigel Inkster of the British Secret Intelligence Service, in which they apparently testified that the White House was behind the forging of the letter. According to a partial transcript of one of Suskind's interviews with Richer, published on Suskind's website, Richer saw a letter on White House stationery that had been passed down the ranks of the CIA – through George Tenet, then-CIA director, then to James Pavitt, the Deputy Director of Operations, then to Pavitt's chief of staff, who passed it on to Richer. The letter, which Richer said might or might not have come from the vice president's office, described a plan to create a forged document and release it "as essentially a representation of something Habbush says".
On August 5, 2008, the White House issued a statement on behalf of George Tenet, Robert Richer and John Maguire, addressing Suskind's allegation. Tenet said:
The CIA issued its own statement on August 22, 2008, saying that Suskind's allegations regarding Habbush "did not happen", and Tenet followed the same day with a second statement saying that Suskind's charges were "demonstrably false in every regard." Nigel Inkster told the "Guardian" that "Mr Suskind's characterisation of our meeting is more the stuff of creative fiction than serious reportage".
Philip Giraldi's allegation.
Former CIA officer Philip Giraldi, writing in "The American Conservative", claimed to have a reliable source who tells him that Suskind's basic story about the White House ordering the forgery is correct, but some of the detail is wrong. His source claims that Dick Cheney ordered the forgery, but not from the CIA, instead using the Office of Special Plans, an office created by Donald Rumsfeld and run by Douglas Feith.
Subsequent reactions.
Author Joe Conason noted that Ayad Allawi had visited CIA headquarters in Langley just days before speaking with Con Coughlin of the "Telegraph".
Con Coughlin, in a blog post highly critical of Suskind, confirmed that he had indeed received the letter from Ayad Allawi. He also called the letter a "leak" and said he got it in November 2003, in Baghdad.
Congressional investigation.
On August 11, 2008, the House Judiciary Committee announced that it would investigate the allegations. The Chairman of the Committee, John Conyers, stated:
As chairman, Conyers wrote to some of those alleged to have been involved (George Tenet, Robert Richer, John Maguire, John P. Hannah and Lewis Libby) on August 20, 2008, but as none of their replies confirmed their knowledge of the fabrication, he concluded "the Administration figures who ordered and authored the apparent forgery... remain unidentified".

Cutler and Porter Block

The Cutler and Porter Block is a historic commercial block at 109 Lyman Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. The four story brick building was constructed in 1894 for the firm of Cutler and Porter Inc, a wholesaler of shoes, boots, and rubber goods. It was made to be visually sympathetic to the adjacent Produce Exchange Building. In the 1920s the firm W.F. Young, Inc. occupied half of the building, eventually taking it over entirely. Young remodeled the premises to accommodate its business, the production of horse liniments, and made changes to the facade, integrating its logo into the brickwork.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The Witch from Melchet Street

The Witch from Melchet Street is a 2007 Israeli modern-day urban fairy tale about magic and first love. It's based on a book by Israeli author Gadi Taub and is geared towards both children and adults as it tells the story of the magical summer that Assaf fell in love for the first time with a neighborhood girl and became close friends with the witch who lived on his street.
Summary.
"The Witch From Melchet Street" is told from the perspective of a grown up Assaf, remembering what it was like to be young and in love and the quirky friend who helped him through it. Plagued by her own broken heart, the three-hundred-year-old witch (with a surprisingly youthful appearance) finds it easy to sympathize with her little neighbor friend, who’s spending his summer pining over a little neighborhood girl who hardly acknowledges his existence. 
Nearly two decades after the summer Assaf is still gripped by his memories. Since then, the little girl has grown up and moved away, but Assaf never left. “When you live in the house you grew up in, your childhood is always right beside you,” he explains. “You buy cigarettes where you used to buy popsicles, you sit at a cafe overlooking your old school.”
Now, when Assaf spots his first love wandering through his neighborhood, he can’t help but follow a few steps behind her, keeping her hot pink dress in sight at all times. As he watches her walk, he can't help but remember the brassy little girl who, long ago, showed no remorse while breaking his heart.

Anna Borkowska (Sister Bertranda)

Anna Borkowska (at that time called Mother Bertranda, O.P.; 1900 –1988), was a Polish cloistered Dominican nun who served as the prioress of her monastery in Kolonia Wileńska, near Wilno, Poland (now Vilnius, Lithuania). She was a graduate of the University of Kraków who had entered the monastery after her studies. During World War II, under her leadership, the nuns of the monastery sheltered 17 young Jewish activists from Nazi persecution. In recognition of this, in 1984 she was awarded the title of Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem.
Hiding Jews.
Vilnius was taken over by the Germans on 24 June 1941, in Operation Barbarossa, and the killing of the Jews began almost immediately. Mother Betranda first agitated to save Vilnius’ Jewish population following the start of the Ponary massacre in July 1941. She initially sought to gain the support of the Vilnius Catholic leadership, but they rebuffed her efforts out of fear that the Nazi German occupation forces would destroy church property and kill any Christian(s) found to be aiding Jews.
Acting on her own initiative, Mother Betranda then took in 17 members of Hashomer Hatzair, a local Zionist group, and hid them within the grounds of her monastery. The activists included Abe Kovner, the movement's leader, Abraham Suckerwer, Arie Wilner and Edek Boraks. They helped the nuns with working their fields, while Kovner, realized the goals of Hitler's Final Solution, worked on organizing a political resistance to the occupation and writing his manifesto for the later uprising. When several of her nuns objected, Mother Bertranda reportedly threatened them with expulsion from the monastery and excommunication from the faith. Some of the Hashomer Hatzair members later decided to leave their monastery hideout and to return to the Jewish Ghetto in Vilnius, where they organized an underground resistance movement.
Ghetto uprising.
Soon after that, Mother Bertranda left the monastery and went to the Ghetto to volunteer her services. She was dissuaded from this by Kovner, who asked that she organize the procurement of supplies instead. She and the other Dominican nuns then took it upon themselves to help the Jewish resistance by smuggling in arms and ammunition. The other nuns of the community included Sister Bernadeta, O.P. (Julia Michrowska), Sister Cecylia, O.P. (Maria Roszek), Sister Diana, O.P. (Helena Frackiewicz), Sister Imelda, O.P. (Maria Neugebauer), Sister Jordana, O.P. (Maria Ostrejko), Sister Małgorzata, O.P. (Irena Adamek) and Sister Stefania, O.P. (Stanisława Bednarska). In this they became among the first to supply hand grenades and other weapons to the Vilnius ghetto underground. Between August and September 1943, some 12,000 men, women and children were deported to camps in Estonia. The uprising, organized by "Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye" (the United Partisan Organization) on 1 September 1943 was crushed. The final Nazi destruction of whatever remained of the Ghetto followed.
In September 1943, Mother Bertranda was arrested by the Nazi German occupation authorities and sent to a labor camp at Perwejniszki, near Kaunas (). The monastery was closed and the community of nuns was forced to disperse. After the war, Mother Bertranda asked for a dispensation from her vows and left the monastery. She reportedly remained a faithful Catholic, nonetheless.
Recognition.
In 1984, Borkowska, now living alone in a small apartment in Warsaw, was awarded the title of Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Abba Kovner, one of the young Jews who had been saved by Borkowska, personally presented a medal to her at a ceremony in Poland. She was the only member of her monastic community to be honored, according to the statistics given by Yad Vashem.

Majestic Tree Hound

The Majestic Tree Hound is a coonhound/bloodhound mix.
Appearance.
These are big hounds with males averaging over 100 pounds. They have the long, low-set earage (with a minimum length specified), heavy flew and dewlap of their ancestors from the Ardennes. They carry more excess skin in general than the American Blue Gascon, and are noteworthy for their abundant flew and dewlap, as well as facial wrinkles.
Temperament.
This is an extremely good-natured and affectionate hound, accepting equally both praise and correction. He is not quarrelsome with his fellows and has a noble and dignified expression.
Origin/history.
The creation of this breed is very recent, but the stem stock goes clear back to medieval northern France and the hounds of St. Hubert. The motives of this breed's creators were much the same as those who sponsor the American Blue Gascon Hound. These hunters wanted to save the large, cold-nosed, methodical working hound as a type in America, but the Majestic Tree Hound's forebear was the working Bloodhound.
Big game hounds of the old Bloodhound/Talbot/St. Hubert type inhabited American soil for many years, and these were crossed with a variety of other hounds for coldtrailing work. The Majestic people say they crossed these Bloodhounds with "western big-game hounds." These dogs may have been of the Gascon type like the Old Line dogs or even strains from those long ago Porcelaines that went west with the Rousseau family.
Lee Newhart, Jr., and several others created the National Majestic Tree Hound Association in 1980and registered the first hounds in that year.
Health.
From what is known thus far, Majestics are a fairly hearty breed. There have been some findings of hip dysplasia as well as the ears needing to be cleaned frequently. Hunting Majestics do best on high performance type of diet as they are a very athletic breed.
Activities.
Intended for rugged terrain and long endurance, they are most suited for lion, bear, bobcat and jaguar, and are able to drive the big cats from their hiding places. They are also good coon hunters where the speed and numbers treed are not as important as the skill, voice and persistence of a hound. (This is true also of American Blue Gascon and Plott Hounds, both big game hunters.)

X-ray transform

In mathematics, the X-ray transform (also called John transform) is an integral transform introduced by Fritz John in 1938 that is one of the cornerstones of modern integral geometry. It is very closely related to the Radon transform, and coincides with it in two dimensions. In higher dimensions, the X-ray transform of a function is defined by integrating over lines rather than over hyperplanes as in the Radon transform. The X-ray transform derives its name from X-ray tomography because the X-ray transform of a function "ƒ" represents the scattering data of a tomographic scan through an inhomogeneous medium whose density is represented by the function "ƒ". Inversion of the X-ray transform is therefore of practical importance because it allows one to reconstruct an unknown density "ƒ" from its known scattering data.
In detail, if "ƒ" is a compactly supported continuous function on the Euclidean space R"n", then the X-ray transform of "ƒ" is the function "Xƒ" defined on the set of all lines in R"n" by
where "x"0 is an initial point on the line and θ is a unit vector giving the direction of the line "L". The latter integral is not regarded in the oriented sense: it is the integral with respect to the 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean line "L".
The X-ray transform satisfies an ultrahyperbolic wave equation called John's equation.
The Gauss hypergeometric function can be written as an X-ray transform .

Joseph Dewey House

The Joseph Dewey House is a historic house at 87 S. Maple Street in Westfield, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story Georgian colonial was built in about 1735 for Joseph Dewey, whose family had been living in the Westfield area since the mid-17th century. Dewey was a local farmer who was also involved in local politics. His grandson Benjamin bought the house later in the 18th century, and added a gristmill and sawmill to his property. He enlarged the house and added Federal style details. The house remained in the Dewey family until 1847. The property then went through a succession of owners, including a several-year period in which a Dewey descendant owned it. The mills were sold off, and redeveloped by the papermaker Crane & Co.
In 1873 the property was purchased by Emma Jane Turner, and it remained in her family for about 100 years. In the 1970s, under threat of demolition, it was acquired by the West Hampden Historical Society, moved to its present location, and carefully restored to its early colonial state. It is now operated by the society as a house museum. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Friedrich Block

The Friedrich Block is a historic mixed-use commercial and residential block at 449-461 Main Street (the corner with Sargeant Street) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. The four story brick and stone building was constructed in 1908 by the E.H. Friedrich Company, a manufacturer of metal architectural parts with a factory in the city; it was designed by local architect George P. B. Alderman. The building's exterior, which includes significant metalwork in Neo-Classical and Italian Renaissance styles, may have used materials produced by the company. At the time of the building's construction the city was engaged in an effort to build housing that was more resistant to fire than wood frame tenements. The building has undergone only modest alterations over the years, principally by the commercial tenants on the ground floor. Its longest-serving commercial tenant was the Weinstein Furniture Company, which operated on the premises from 1926 to 1995; Samuel Weinstein purchased the building in 1948. The apartments, which housed an ethnic diversity of primarily factory workers, saw significant wear as well as damage from vandalism. The building has recently been rehabilitated.
The Friedrick Block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

The Gunn and Hubbard Blocks are historic blocks at 463-477 State Street in the Old Hill section of Springfield, Massachusetts. Located across the street from the Springfield Armory, these are two of the oldest commercial buildings in Springfield. The Gunn Block (473-477 State Street) was built in 1830 by Elisha Gunn, who traded in goods from the West Indies. The Hubbard Block (461-471 State Street) was built five years later by Asahel Hubbard, an inspector at the Armory, as a real estate venture. His principal tenant was Jonathan Bangs, the operator of a local grist mill. As the 19th century progressed, the center of commerce in Springfield moved to what is now the downtown area, but these two blocks continued to serve the neighborhood's needs until the 1890s, when Winchester Square became more important.

Hampden County Courthouse

Hampden County Courthouse is a historic courthouse on Elm Street in Springfield, Massachusetts designed by Henry Hobson Richardson. This was the county's second courthouse. The first courthouse was built in 1822, but by the 1860s, popular pressure was developing for a new courthouse. A grand jury indicted the county commissioners in 1869 for official misconduct since the courthouse did not have fireproof storage for the registry of deeds and the safekeeping of public records. This forced the county to build a new courthouse.
Construction began in late 1871, and the building was dedicated on April 28, 1874. The original building cost $214,068. The site, within the middle of a city block and measuring 160 by 90 feet, cost $75,716. The building is shaped roughly like the capital letter I, with the main facade emphasizing vertical lines, tall windows, and two tall dormers on either side of the bell tower. The facades were built of light gray Monson granite in rough-faced random ashlar masonry, with smooth-faced trim. The overall design reflects Richardson's evolution as a designer, showing development from the Brattle Square Church.
The county's growth eventually pushed the probate court and registry of deeds into another building in 1907, and the county built a large addition to the building between 1908 and 1912. This was designed by Richardson's successor firm Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. The sloping roof and high dormers were eliminated in the remodeling, making it difficult to visualize some parts of Richardson's original design.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Today, it houses the juvenile and Western Division of the Massachusetts Housing Court. The Courthouse is part of the Court Square Historic District.

Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders

The "Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders" were a series of promotional sampler compilation albums released by Warner Bros. Records throughout the 1970s. Each album (usually a 2-record set) contained a wide variety of tracks by artists under contract to Warner Bros. and its subsidiary labels (primarily Reprise Records); often these were singles, B-sides, non-hit album tracks, or otherwise obscure material, all designed to arouse interest in the artists' regular albums. Also found on some were humorous, bizarre interstitial audio material—clips from old records and movies, short skits, found sound, etc.--and most albums featured clever, humorous cover art and liner notes. Most of the '70s albums were compiled and annotated by Barry Hansen, aka "Dr. Demento".
Overview.
Warner advertised the Loss Leaders albums by inserting special illustrated inner sleeves in all of its regular album releases, listing all of the currently available Loss Leaders and including an order form. Each Loss Leader double album was priced at $2USD, significantly less than a comparable regular-release double album of the time. (There were also a few single disc issues in 1969-71, and at least one "triple" disc set.) The fact that Warner sold these double albums at low cost in hopes of increasing sales of their regular releases is the source of the series name "Loss Leaders".
The first Loss Leaders compilation was "The 1969 Warner/Reprise Songbook", featuring a wide range of artists from Miriam Makeba to the Mothers of Invention; the last of the original series was the punk & New Wave-themed"Troublemakers" in 1980. "Loss Leaders Revisited" was a one-off 1995 CD compilation; there have however been no further Loss Leaders releases.

Illustrious Corpses

Illustrious Corpses () is a 1976 Italian thriller film directed by Francesco Rosi and starring Lino Ventura. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. Its title refers to the surrealist game, Cadavre Exquis, invented by André Breton, in which the participants draw consecutive sections of a figure without seeing what the previous person has drawn, leading to unpredictable results, and is meant to describe the meandering nature of the film with its unpredictable foray into the world of political manipulations, as well as the ("illustrous") corpses of the murdered judges.
In 2008 the film was selected to enter the list of the 100 Italian films to be saved.
Plot.
The film starts with the murder of District Attorney Vargas in Palermo, amongst a climate of demonstrations, strikes and political tension between the Left and the government. The subsequent investigation failing, the police assign the protagonist Inspector Rogas (Lino Ventura) to solve the case. While he is starting his investigation, two judges are killed. All victims turn out to have worked together on several cases. After Rogas discovers evidence of corruption surrounding the three government officials, he is encouraged by superiors "not to forage after gossip," but to trail the "crazy lunatic who for no reason whatever is going about murdering judges." This near admission of guilt drives Rogas to seek out three men wrongfully convicted by the murdered judges. He is joined by a journalist friend working for a far-left newspaper, Cusan.
Rogas finds his likely suspect in Cres, a man who was convicted of attempting to kill his wife. Mrs. Cres accused her husband of trying to kill her by poisoning her rice pudding, which she escaped only because she fed a small portion first to her cat, who died. Rogas concludes that he was probably framed by his wife, and seeks him out, only to find that he has disappeared from his house. Meanwhile another district attorney is killed, and eyewitnesses see two young revolutionaries running away from the scene. Rogas, close to finding his man, is demoted, and told to work with the political division to pin the crimes on the revolutionary Leftist terrorist groups.
Rogas discovers that his phone is tapped. He seeks out the Supreme Court's president (Max von Sydow) in order to warn him that he is most likely the next victim. The president details a philosophy of justice wherein the court is incapable of error by definition. Music from a party in the same building leads to Rogas discovering the Minister of Justice (Fernando Rey) at the party with many revolutionary leaders, amongst them the editor of the revolutionary paper Cusan is working for, Galano, and Mrs. Cres. He and the Minister have a discussion, where the Minister reveals that sooner or later, his party will have to form a coalition with the Communist Party, and that it will be their task to prosecute the far-leftist groups. The murder of the judges as well as Rogas's investigations help raise the tension and justify the prosecution of the far-left groups. Rogas also discovers that his suspect, Cres, is present at the party. Rogas meets with the Secretary-General of the Communist Party in a museum. Both of them are killed. Amongst raising tensions between revolutionaries and the government, who mobilize the army, the murder of the Secretary-General is blamed on Rogas by the chief of police. The film ends with a discussion between Cusan and the vice-secretary of the Communist Party, who claims that the time is not yet ready for the revolution and the party will not react to the government's actions. "But then the people must never know the truth?", asks Cusan. The vice-secretary answers: "The truth is not always revolutionary." It is a sardonic concluding comment on the strategy at the time of the 'historic compromise' with Christian Democracy adopted by the Communist party, referring back to the motto 'To tell the truth is revolutionary' adopted from Ferdinand Lassalle by Antonio Gramsci, the party's most famous former leader and author of the Prison Notebooks.

Haynes Hotel

The Haynes Hotel or Waters Building is a historic building at 1386-1402 Main Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. The five story Italianate brick was built in 1864 for Theodore "Tilly" Haynes, proprietor of a store at another location that was destroyed by fire. Haynes operated a hotel on the site, and the post office also operated in the corner space of the building until the 1880s. The hotel was one of the largest in the city of the time, but was later eclipsed by the Hotel Charles, which was larger and located nearer the railroad.
Haynes sold the property in 1876 to Clara Goodman, who purchased it for her son-in-law, H. H. Waters. In 1943 the old hotel lobby was converted to retail space, and the upper floors were converted to office space. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The Henking Hotel and Cafe was a historic building at 15-21 Lyman Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. The four story hotel brick and stone building was built in 1880 for Gustave and Elizabeth Gruendler, German immigrants who had operated hotels elsewhere in the city for some time. Upon their death the building was taken over by Henry Henking, who had worked for the Gruendlers. He changed the name of the hotel and remodeled its facade in a Georgian Revival style. His son Gus took over the business upon his death in 1906, and further expanded the business, building a banquet space adjacent. The hotel was strategically located opposite an entrance to the railroad station, and the business of the small family-run hotel was good despite competition from larger hotels nearby.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and demolished some time thereafter.

<doc id="18732880" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18732880" title="Storey">
Storey

A storey (Australian English, British English, Canadian English) or story (American English) is any level part of a building that could be used by people (for living, work, storage, recreation, etc.). The plurals are storeys and stories, respectively.
The terms floor, level, or deck can also be used in this sense; except that one may use "ground floor" and "ground level" for the floor closer to what is considered the ground or street level, whereas "storey" is commonly used only for levels strictly above or below that level. The words "storey" and "floor" also generally exclude levels of the building that have no roof, even if they are used by people—such as the terrace on the top roof of many buildings.
Houses commonly have only a few floors, often only one. Buildings are often classified as low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise according to how many levels they contain; but these categories are not well-defined. The tallest skyscraper in the world, Burj Khalifa, has 163 floors. , the tallest planned skyscraper, Sky City, is planned to have 202 floors.
The height of each storey is based on the ceiling height of the rooms plus the thickness of the floors between each pain. Generally this is around 10 feet or 3 metres total, however it varies widely from just under this figure to well over it. Storeys within a building need not be all the same height — often the lobby is more spacious, for example. Higher levels may be smaller in area than the ones beneath (a prominent feature of the Willis Tower).
In English, the principal floor or main floor of a house is the floor that contains the chief apartments; it is usually the ground floor, or the floor above. In Italy the main floor of a home is usually above the ground level, and may be called the "piano nobile" ("noble floor").
The attic or loft is a storey just below the building's roof; its ceiling is often pitched and/or at a different height than that of other floors. A penthouse is a luxury apartment on the topmost storey of a building. A basement is a storey below the main or ground floor; the first (or only) basement of a home is also called the lower ground floor.
Split-level homes have floors that offset from each other by less than the height of a full storey. A mezzanine, in particular, is typically a floor halfway between the ground floor and the next higher floor. Homes with a split-level entry have the entire main floor raised half a storey height above the street entrance level, and a basement that is half a storey below this level. In Macy's Herald Square, there is a "one and a half" floor between the first and second, this can be considered a split level floor.
There are also multi-storey car parks, also known as parking garages.
Numbering.
Floor numbering is the numbering scheme used for a building's floors. There are two major schemes in use across the world. In one system, used in the majority of Europe, the ground floor is the floor on the ground and often has no number or is assigned the number zero. Therefore the next floor up is assigned the number 1 and is the first floor. The other system, used primarily in the United States, counts the bottom floor as number 1 or first floor. The next floor up then becomes the second floor and so on. Having the first floor above the ground floor means that subterranean levels (often listed with increasing depth as B1, B2..) can be counted without having a gap at 0 (ground). In both systems, the numbering of higher floors continues sequentially as one goes up, as shown in the following table:
Each scheme has further variations depending on how one refers to the ground floor and the subterranean levels. The existence of two incompatible conventions is a common source of confusion in international communication, sometimes even between communities who speak the same language.
In all English-speaking countries, however, the storeys in a building are "counted" in the same way. Thus, for example, the phrase a seven-storey building would mean the same thing in Britain and in the US — namely, a building with seven covered floors, including one at ground level and six at higher levels; even though the topmost of those levels would be called "6th floor" in Britain, and "7th floor" in the US. Some count mezzanines as storeys, some ignore them.
European scheme.
In most of Europe, the "first storey" or "first floor" is the level above ground level. This scheme is also used in many former British colonies, and in many Latin American countries (including Mexico and Brazil) and in many of the Commonwealth nations (except Singapore and most of Canada).
This convention can be traced back to Medieval European usage. In countries that use this system, the floor at ground level is usually referred to by a special name, usually translating as "Ground Floor" or equivalent. For example, "rez-de-chaussée" ("street level") in France, "Erdgeschoss" ("ground floor") in Germany, "piano terra" (lit. "ground floor") in Italy, "begane grond" ("walked-upon ground") in Dutch, "planta baja" or "planta baixa" ("bottom floor") in Spain, "andar térreo" ("ground walkplace") in Brazil, "rés-do-chão" ("close to the ground") in Portugal, "földszint" ("ground level") in Hungary, "parter" ("based on French "par terre", which means "on the ground"") in Poland and Romania, "prízemie" ("by the ground") in Slovakia, and "pritličje" ("close to the ground") in Slovenia. In some countries that use this scheme, the higher floors may be explicitly qualified as being above the ground level — such as in Slovenian "prvo nadstropje" (literally "first upper floor").
In Spain the level above ground level is sometimes "Entresuelo" in Spanish ("Entresòl" in Catalan, etc., which literally means "between-floors" but corresponds to the English term mezzanine), and elevators can skip it. The next one is sometimes called "Principal". The "first floor" can therefore be three levels above ground level.

The English-speaking parts of Canada generally follow the American convention, where the "first" floor is the floor at the ground level and the floor above it is the "second" floor. Canada however uses the spelling storey, not story. In Quebec, the European scheme was formerly used (as in France), but by now it has been mostly replaced by the US system; so that "rez-de-chaussée" and "premier étage" ("first stage") are now generally equivalent in Quebec. Mexico, on the other hand, uses the European system.
The U.S. system is also used in Russia and some countries of the former Soviet Union, and in some (but not all) Latin American countries. So, for example, "planta baja" and "primer piso" ("first floor"), which are distinct in Spain and Mexico, are equivalent in Chile and Peru, and refer both to the ground-level floor (although "primer piso" is used mainly for indoor areas, while "planta baja" is also used for areas outside the building).
Most countries in eastern Asia, including China (excluding Hong Kong), Japan, and Singapore, follow the North American system. In the grammar of the respective languages, the numbers precede the word "floor", and are cardinals rather than ordinals; so they would translate literally as "1 floor, 2 floor" (etc.), rather than
"1st floor, 2nd floor", or "floor 1, floor 2".
In Singapore, the British system of numbering originally prevailed, but this was replaced in the 1980s with the North American scheme to avoid confusion with the Chinese scheme. In order to emphasise the difference from the original scheme, reference is frequently made to storeys or levels rather than floors) - so the 3rd floor is the 4th storey (or storey 4) or 4th level (or level 4). Many buildings continue to label storeys or levels rather than floors. Some time later, some newer buildings began to use 'floors' instead of naming them as 'storeys' or 'levels'.
Idiosyncrasies.
Some American high-rise buildings follow the British system, often out of a desire on the part of the building's architect or owners to suggest a posh UK / European setting. Conversely, an arrangement often found in high rise public housing blocks, particularly those built in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s, is that elevators would only call at half the total number of floors, or at an intermediate level between a pair of floors; thus a 24 story building would only have 12 apparent floors, a 30 storey building would have 15 apparent floors and so on. This was commonly used as a cost saving measure to reduce the number of elevators (or elevator stops) needed to service the building, therefore staircases would be used to access an "upper" and "lower" level from each intermediate landing.
Occasionally, buildings in the United States and Canada will have both a "1st floor" (usually the main floor of the building) and a "ground floor" below it. This typically happens when both floors have street-level entrances, as is often the case for hillside buildings. In the UK, the lower of these floors would be called the "lower ground floor", while the upper would be called either the "upper ground floor" or simply the "ground floor". Multi-storey car parks which have a staggered arrangement of parking levels sometimes use a convention where there may be an "upper" and "lower" level of the same floor number, (e.g: "1U/U1" = Upper 1st, "L2/2L" = "Lower 2nd", and so on), although the elevators will typically only serve one of the two levels, or the elevator lobby for each floor pair may be between the two levels.
Sometimes, floor number 1 may be assigned to the lowest basement level; in that case the ground floor may be numbered 2 or higher. Sometimes two connected buildings (such as a store and its carpark) have incongruent floor numberings, due to sloping terrain or different ceiling heights.
In Norway and Sweden the floors are numbered as in the North American scheme ("1st" = "ground", "2nd", etc.); but one can also refer to them by how many flights of stairs one needs to climb to reach them from the ground floor. So, in Swedish "2:a våningen" ("2nd floor") is the same as "1 trappa upp" ("1 stair up"); "3:e våningen" ("3rd floor") is also "2 trappor upp" ("2 stairs up"); and so on. In modern lifts, however, floors are numbered according to British convention, where the street level is referred to E (for "entré", or entrance) or BV (for bottenvåning, or bottom floor) and the next floor is given the number 1.
In most instances, American and Canadian buildings omit the thirteenth floor in their floor numbering because of common superstition surrounding this number. The floor numbering may either go straight from 12 to 14, or the floor may be given an alternative name such as "Skyline".
In Hong Kong, the British numbering system is now generally used, in English and Chinese alike. In some older residential buildings, however, the floors are identified by signs in Chinese characters that say "二樓" ("2 floor") at the floor just above ground, as in the North American system. For those buildings, the Chinese phrase "三樓" or its English equivalent "3rd floor" may refer either to the storey three levels above ground (as in the modern numbering), which is actually labeled "四樓" ("4 floor"); or to the storey with the sign "三樓" ("3 floor"), which is only two levels above ground. This confusing state of affairs has led, for example, to numerous errors in utility billing. To avoid ambiguity, business forms often ask that storey numbers in address fields be written "as accessed from a lift".
In some Chinese and Taiwanese buildings (typically high-rises), the 4th floor is actually omitted or skipped, along with other floors ending in 4 such as the 14th and 24th floors, with the floor above the third numbered as the fifth and so on. This is due to the Chinese word for "four" being very phonetically similar (though not exact homonyms in most dialects due to their intonations) to the word for "dead" or "die". Also for this reason, apartments on the 4th floor in Asian countries such as Taiwan have traditionally been cheaper to rent. This cultural superstition can be considered a form of tetraphobia. It is also common in China for the 13th floor to also be omitted.
Lift/Elevator buttons.
In most of the world, elevator buttons for storeys above the ground level are usually marked with the corresponding numbers. In many countries, modern elevators also have Braille numbers—often mandated by law.
European scheme.
In countries that use the European system, the ground floor is either marked 0, or with the initial letter of the local word for ground floor (G, E, etc.), successive floors are then marked 1, 2 etc. However, even when the ground floor button is marked with a letter, some digital position indicators may show 0 when the lift / elevator is on that floor. If the building also contains floors below ground, negative numbers are common. This then gives a conventional numbering sequence -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... In Spain in elevators, the ground floor is usually marked PB ("planta baja", "planta baixa", etc.), and in buildings where these exist, the "entresuelo" or "entresòl" and "principal" are marked E and P, respectively. In France, floors are usually marked the same way as in Spain, however the letters for the ground floor are RC ("rez-de-chaussée"), seldom simplified to R. Where these exist, there are high ground RCH ("rez-de-chaussée haut") and lower ground RCB ("rez-de-chaussée bas"), or garden ground RJ ("rez-de-jardin") and former ground RC.
For example, in the Polish language there is a clear distinction: the word "parter" means ground floor and "piętro" means a floor above the "parter", usually with an ordinal: 1st "piętro", 2nd "piętro" etc. Therefore a "parter" is the zeroth "piętro". Older elevators in Poland have button marked P for the ground floor ("parter") and S for basement ("suterena"). Elevators installed since 1990 have 0 for "parter" and -1, -2 etc. for underground floors.
North American scheme.
In countries that use the North American system, where "floor 1" is the same as "ground floor", the corresponding button may be marked either with 1, or with a letter, as in the European scheme. In either case, the next button will be labeled 2. In buildings that have both a "1st floor" and a "ground floor", they may be labeled 1 and G; or M (for "Main") and LM (for "Lower Main"). M may also be used to designate a mezzanine level, when it is not counted as a separate floor in the building's numbering scheme.
In modern signage, at least in North America, a five-pointed star (★) additionally appears beside the button for the "main entry" floor. In the United States, the five-pointed star marking is mandated by Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as described in Section 4.10.12(2) of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG).
Subterranean floors.
The numbering of levels below ground is also quite varied, even within the same country. In English-speaking countries, the first level below ground may be labelled B for "Basement", LL for "Lower Level" or "Lower Lobby", C for "Cellar" or, in the case of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, U for "Underground". In British buildings, LG for "Lower Ground" is commonly encountered.
If there is more than one basement, the next level down may be marked SB for "Sub-Basement". The lower levels may also be numbered B1, B2, etc.. Negative numbers are sometimes used: −1 for the first level below ground, −2 for the second one, etc. Lettered levels are also sometimes used: A, B, C, etc.
In countries with the metric system only, like France, the negative numbers are used exclusively.
Half-height/split-level parking garages.
In malls, one may find half-height parking garages, in which the floors are named after the mall, but the floors that between the mall's floors may have suffixes like "A" or "M" added. For example, "1", "1A", "2", "2A", etc. The floors maybe numbered as "1", "1½", "2", "2½", or "1", "1.5", "2", "2.5" etc. Elevators in half-height parking garages in malls usually stop only at the mall levels and not the parking levels between the mall levels.
In split-level parking garages, the lower level may have the suffix "A" and the upper level have the suffix "B", like "1A", "1B", "2A", "2B", etc. Elevators in split-level parking garages normally stop at one of the two split levels, and the parking levels in elevators may be named just "1", "2", etc.
Other labels.
Elevator buttons may also be labeled according to their main function. In English-speaking countries, besides the common L for "Lobby", one may find P for "Pool" or "Parking" (and P1, P2, etc. for multiple parking floors), S for "Skyway", R for "Restaurant" or Roof, PH for "Penthouse", OD for "Observation Deck", etc.. In some US buildings, the label G on the elevator may stand for the building's "Garage", which need not be located on the "Ground" floor.
One hotel in Toronto marks the first six floors as A, M, MM, C, H, and 1 (for "Arcade", "Main", "Main Mezzanine", "Convention", "Health Club", and "1st floor"). The North Carolina Museum of Art, whose entrance is on the third floor up, has the floors lettered C, B, A (the main floor), and O (for "Office"). The Festival Walk mall in Hong Kong has floors labelled LG2 and LG1 ("Lower Ground 2" and "1"), G ("Ground"), and UG ("Upper Ground").
Room numbering.
In modern buildings, especially large ones, room or apartment numbers are usually tied to the floor numbers, so that one can figure out the latter from the former. Typically one uses the floor number with one or two extra digits appended to identify the room within the floor. For example, room 215 could be the 15th room of floor 2 (or 5th room of floor 21), but to avoid this confusion one dot is sometimes used to separate the floor from the room (2.15 refers to 2nd floor, 15th room and 21.5 refers to 21st floor, 5th room) or a leading zero is placed before a single-digit room number (i.e. the 5th room of floor 21 would be 2105). Letters may be used, instead of digits, to identify the room within the floor—such as 21E instead of 215. Often odd numbers are used for rooms on one side of a hallway, even numbers for rooms on the other side.
An offset may be used to accommodate unnumbered floors. For example, in a building with floors labeled G, M, 1, 2, ..., 11 and 12, the 4th room in each of those floors could be numbered 104, 114, 124, 134, ..., 224, and 234, respectively — with an offset of 11 in the floor numbers. This trick is sometimes used to make the floor number slightly less obvious, e.g. for security or marketing reasons.
Portugal.
In Portugal, the rule (official standard) is:
These two rules, universally adopted, made many things easy, namely for blind people, who don't need to ask where is the apartment "X".

Laflin-Phelps Homestead

The Laflin—Phelps Homestead is a historic late Federalist style house at 20 Depot Street in Southwick, Massachusetts. The date of its construction is uncertain: the property was purchased in 1809 by Heman Laflin, member of the locally prominent Laflin family, who were among Southwick's early settlers. It is not believed to have a house on it in 1807, so the house may have been built either by or for Laflin. The house was built as a 2.5 Federal-style colonial, although it also has significant Greek Revival styling. The building originally had a 1.5 story ell on the back, which was expanded to a full 2.5 stories sometime between 1830 and 1850. A barn, built c. 1820, was demolished in 2004; only its foundation remains.
The house was purchased from the Laflin family by Matthew Phelps in 1865, in whose family it remained as of 2005. The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

<doc id="18732902" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18732902" title="Sialoendoscopy">
Sialoendoscopy

Sialoendoscopy is a minimally invasive technique that allows for salivary gland surgery for the safe and effective treatment of sialadenitis and other conditions of the salivary glands. During sialoendoscopy a small camera is placed into the salivary glands through the salivary ducts that empty into the mouth. Sialoendoscopy is an efficient yet simple mode of treatment for major salivary gland obstructions, strictures and sialoliths (salivary stones). Depending on the obstruction, sialoendoscopy can be conducted under local anesthesia in an outpatient office or in the operating room under general anesthesia.
Conditions indicating sialoendoscopy.
Salivary gland stones are one of the major causes of salivary gland infections (sialadenitis). These types of stones can be found in 1.2 percent of the general population. 
The second leading cause of salivary obstruction is from strictures and adhesions, which can happen from prior salivary gland infections, including childhood infections like mumps. Most strictures could be seen in the parotid duct and mostly in the disease process of chronic recurrent sialadenitis.
Description of the technique.
Generally, the salivary duct opening needs to be either or incised prior to introduction of the endoscope. Once the sialoendoscope is in place, saline is utilized to dilate the salivary duct and its branching. 
Once the endoscopes are introduced into gland, the internal anatomy is explored either for diagnosis or for treatment of a specific disease entity. The endoscope is introduced into the gland through its natural orifice in the mouth or by a making a small incision in the duct opening. These techniques for introduction are completely intraoral techniques.
Treatment of strictures and adhesions.
In the case of strictures or adhesions, the following technique can be used as a treatment modality. First the surgeon will makes his diagnosis and find the exact location of the obstruction using a sialogram. Following this, the surgeon can use the endoscopic method. The first step in this is anesthetizing and laving the duct with 2 percent lidocaine and saline. If there is no improvement, the surgeon then can insert a dilation balloon, which can be inflated up to 3 mm. The pressure created by the inflation can be sufficient to dilate most strictures. Another technique for dilating strictures is to expand the stricture region with grasping forceps used as a dilator.
Instrumentation.
The ability to perform this technique is the result of the development of miniaturized endoscopic imaging tools. The majority of sialoendoscopes that are currently in use are of the semirigid type. The semirigid endoscope allows for visualization of the diseased process, but the stiffness allows manipulation and navigation of the internal salivary anatomy. 
Multiple types of micro instrumentation are available, including grasping forceps, biopsy forceps, drills, needles, laser fibers, and lithotripters (although the last is currently unavailable in the US pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval). Multiple companies make various types of sialoendoscopes and instrumentation. There are advantages and disadvantages to all of the systems and none are recommend over the other. Different practitioners utilize different systems due to the experience and clinical training of the surgeon.

Life.
Anthony Dominic Fahy (or Fahey) was born on 11 January 1805 in Loughrea, County Galway, Ireland.
He was ordained priest on 19 March 1831, in Rome. Between 1834 to 1836 he lived and worked with his Dominican brothers in the Saint Joseph Convent, in Somerset, Ohio. In 1836 he returned to Ireland.
In 1843, Fahy was appointed by the Archbishop of Dublin Daniel Murray to the Irish chaplaincy of Buenos Aires in replace of father Patrick O'Gorman.
In a short time Fahy become leader of the Irish community in Argentina and, as himself wrote, he acted as consul, postmaster, financial adviser, marriage counselor, matchmaker, judge, interpreter and employment agent for the member of his community. 
Fahy organized his flock in chaplaincies in Buenos Aires province, and appointed twelve Irish priests to these areas.

McKnight District

The McKnight District is a predominanty residential neighborhood northeast of downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. The area represents a planned residential development covering several hundred acres, which was built out in the mid to late 19th century. The architects of the development were James and William McKnight, who, in addition to developing and enforcing construction guidelines in the area, built and landscaped many of the properties. The area was largely built out by 1910, and there has been little new construction in the area since. Most of the houses built in the area were constructed in most of the architectural styles that were popular between 1880 and 1990, although there is a predominance of the Queen Anne style. The McKnights began to develop the area, which had previously been mainly farmland, in 1870 with the purchase of a parcel on which they and a partner built their own homes. They proceeded over the following years to acquire additional parcels of land in the area, plat out roads, and either build houses themselves, or sell plots to other builders. They enforced some uniformity in the area through the use of deed restrictions, which required uniform setback requirements, banned fencing, and required a minimum cost of construction (the latter to prevent the building of inexpensive tenement-style housing).
The neighborhood is roughly defined by the railroad tracks on the north and the Bay Street to the south. On the west it is roughly bounded by Armory and Magazine Streets, and on the east by Monmouth, Clifford, Bay, and Marion Streets. A portion of the neighborhood, encompassing some and 350 homes, was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. This was expanded in 1986 to and 884 properties, encompassing virtually the entirety of the McKnight's development.

Agoseris aurantiaca

Agoseris aurantiaca is a liguliferous species in the Asteraceae or sunflower family, and is commonly called orange agoseris or mountain dandelion. It is widespread and common in western North America from Alaska and western Canada southward to California, Arizona, and New Mexico. It also occurs disjunctly in the Chic-Choc (Gaspe Peninsula) and Otish Mountains (Laurentian Plateau) of Quebec. This is primarily a species of mountainous regions and may be found in wet to dry habitats. It is a perennial herb producing a basal rosette of leaves. There is no stem, but it does produce several stem-like peduncles, each peduncle bearing a single flower head surrounded by glabrous to hairy phyllaries. The head is ligulate, containing several ray florets but no disc florets. The florets are most commonly orange but are occasionally yellow, pink, red, or purple. The flower head matures into a ball-like head of beaked achenes, each with a terminal pappus of numerous, white bristles.

Memorial Town Hall

Memorial Town Hall is the historic town hall of Monson, Massachusetts. Located on Main Street on land donated by the local prominent Reynolds family, the High Victorian Gothic stone building was constructed in 1885 to a design by George Potter. In keeping with a memorial to the town's fallen soldiers, there are two cannons (one from the American Civil War, the other from the First World War) in front of the building.
The hall, which was built of the locally-quarried granite (from the same quarry that supplied granite for the Springfield Armory), the building's basic shape is that of a T. The northwest (left front) corner has a four story tower, and the southwest (right front) corner has a smaller octagonal turret. In between, a gabled pavilion is centered on the front faced perpendicular to the main roofline. The stem of the T extends northeast to the rear of the building. Arches and other decorative elements are shaped out of ashlar granite in alternating light and dark colors. The building's roof is slate; the front portion is hipped, with the center interrupted by the front-facing gable. The rear section ends in a gable.
Inside the hall, the front houses town offices, and a space that was originally used as a GAR meeting space, and the rear of the building houses an auditorium with stage. Interior spaces have not been significantly altered since the building's construction was completed, and most continue to be used for their original purpose. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and was included as a contributing property in the Monson Center Historic District in 1991.

She received her Ph.D. in Anthropology from Yale University in 1991. She is the author of numerous books and essays as well as a former editor of the academic journal "Public Culture".
Povinelli’s work has focused on developing a critical theory of late liberalism that would support an anthropology of the otherwise. This critical task is animated by a critical engagement with the traditions of American pragmatism and continental immanent theory and grounded in the circulation of values, materialities, and socialities within settler liberalisms. Her first two books examined the governance of the otherwise in late liberal settler colonies from the perspective of the politics of recognition. In particular, they focused on impasses within liberal systems of law and value as they meet local Australian indigenous worlds, and the effect of these impasses on the development of legal and public culture in Australia. Her second two books, "The Empire of Love: Toward a Theory of Intimacy, Genealogy, and Carnality" and "Economies of Abandonment: Social Belonging and Endurance in Late Liberalism", examine formations of the Late Liberal Anthropocene from the perspective of intimacy, embodiment, and narrative form. 
Povinelli has also explored these questions in the short film, "Karrabing, Low Tide Turning", selected for the 2012 Berlinale International Film Festival, Shorts Competition. Karrabing was co-directed with Liza Johnson and written with the Karrabing Indigenous Corporation. Povinelli also appeared in the documentary film "Apparition of the Eternal Church" (2006), directed by Paul Festa, about the French composer Olivier Messiaen's organ work.
She was the recipient of the German Transatlantic Program Prize and Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin for Fall 2011.

Mills-Hale-Owen Blocks

The Mills—Hale—Owen Blocks are a collection of three historic mixed-use commercial and residential blocks at 959—991 Main Street in the South End of Springfield, Massachusetts. They occupy an entire city block on the east side of Main Street, between Union and Hubbard Streets. The Mills and Hale blocks were both built in 1874, and are two of the best examples of Italianate architecture of the period in the city. They were also the first major buildings built in a push to extend the downtown area to the south, and introduced the mixed use style of building use. The Owen block was built in 1899 in a Classical Revival style reflective of the further expansion of Springfield's downtown area. All three buildings housed a variety of retail businesses on their ground floors. The upper floors of the Mills block were first used as a boarding house, while those of the other two served as residential tenement-style housing. The buildings were rehabilitated in the 1980s, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Mills-Stebbins Villa

The Mills-Stebbins Villa is a historic house at 3 Crescent Hill in Springfield, Massachusetts. Described as the "best work" of architect Henry Sykes, this Italian style villa was built between 1849 and 1851 for John Mills, a prominent Springfield attorney. Mills died in 1861, and the villa was acquired by John Stebbins, a banker, real estate developer, and local politician. It fell into decline in the 20th century, but was rehabilitated and restored in the early 1970s.
The villa is located at the top of a ridge that historically separated Springfield's downtown and working class South End from the more upscale Maple Street Hill area. It was built of brick that was probably once covered with a stucco-style mastic. The most prominent architectural feature is a tower at the front of the house that echoes the style of an Italian Renaissance campanile. The massing of the building falls away in successive stages. The brickwork is relieved by stone and wood detailing, and there are a few unusual windows on the front facade. A service wing was added to the rear of the house c. 1900.
Inside the building, the formal rooms of the house were on the north side, while the central part of the house contains the bedrooms and a library. The service wing added space for a nursery on the south side. A number of rooms included full-length windows that provided access to outdoor spaces, including a patio area on the north side as well as several balconies.
The villa was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and included as a contributing property to the Ames Hill/Crescent Hill District in 1974.

While calling games for the Estevan Bruins, Boston Bruins President Weston Adams heard Laing's play by play on scouting trips. Adams was very impressed with Laing's impartiality, especially in games between Estevan and their rivals, the Weyburn Red Wings. According to Boston Bruins announcer Fred Cusick, Laing "was a dead ringer, in voice and inflection, for Foster Hewitt, Canada's legendary hockey announcer". He was hired by Adams in 1966 to call Bruins games on radio. Laing was 23 years old at the time of his hiring. 
Laing was fired after only one season due to his tendency to lean on the negative. He was replaced by Bob Wilson the following season.

Milton-Bradley Company (building)

The Milton-Bradley Company is a historic former factory building at Park, Cross, and Willow Streets in Springfield, Massachusetts. The factory was built beginning in about 1880, and expanded over the next decades to include a variety of brick multi-story buildings that are relatively utilitarian in appearance. When built, the property belonged to George Tapley, a principal in the Taylor and Tapley Manufacturing Company and a childhood friend of Milton Bradley. Bradley had entered the toy business in the 1860s, and moved his company to Tapley's premises in 1882. The success of his eponymous company led to a significant expansion of the premises, which eventually came to occupy an entire city block. The company moved its manufacturing to suburban East Longmeadow in the 1960s, and the complex was converted into residential housing in the late 1970s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The New Bay Diner Restaurant is a historic diner at 950 Bay Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. It was manufactured by the Mountain View Diner Company in Signus, New Jersey (as #532) in 1957; it is believed to be the second-to-last diner the company built before it shut down later that year. The diner is attached to a concrete block structure which houses the kitchen and restrooms, and appears to also date to 1957. At the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, it was one of six surviving Mountain View diners in Massachusetts, and the only diner remaining in Springfield.
When the diner was listed in Springfield's 1964 business directory, it was called the New Bay Diner Restaurant, and its owner was listed as Anthony Viamare of Granby, Massachusetts. Viamare owned it until 1988, when it was acquired by Donald Roy. He changed its name to the "Route 66 Diner", which is its present name.
The diner is of steel frame construction, seven window bays wide, with rounded corners. It is mounted on a concrete and brick foundation, has red horizontal banding, and a rounded rubber membrane roof. The doors are steel and glass, although elements of the vestibule do not appear to be original. Its windows are plate glass, separated by steel pilasters. There are signs on the roof, facing east and west, with the diner's name, "Route 66 Diner"; the "Diner" is highlighted in neon. Inside, the diner has a full length counter, with staff access points at the center and the left side. Access to the kitchen is by a door in the center. The diner has seventeen stools and six booths. Its interior decoration is largely original; the countertop has been replaced.

<doc id="18733072" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18733072" title="4 Baruch">
4 Baruch

Fourth Baruch is a pseudepigraphical text of the Old Testament. Paralipomena of Jeremiah appears as the title in several ancient Greek manuscripts of the work, meaning "things left out of (the Book of) Jeremiah."[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rs/rak/publics/pseudepig/ParJer-Eng.html]. It is part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Amharic Bible.
Description.
Fourth Baruch is regarded as pseudepigraphical by all Christian churches, except in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (see Rest of the Words of Baruch).
The text is known in both full-length and reduced versions. The full-length versions came down to us in Greek (older manuscripts dated 10th-11th centuries and 15th century ), in Ethiopic Ge'ez (titled Rest of the Words of Baruch, the older manuscript dated 15th century), in Armenian and in Slavic. The shorted versions have come down to us in Greek (named "Meneo"), Romanian and Slavic.
4 Baruch is usually dated in the first half of 2nd century AD. Abimelech's sleep of 66 years, instead of the usual 70 years of Babylonian captivity, makes think to the year AD 136, that is 66 years after the fall of the Second Temple in AD 70. This dating is coherent with the message of the text. 
4 Baruch uses a simple and fable-like style with speech-making animals, fruit that never rot, and an eagle sent by the Lord that revives the dead. 
Some parts of 4 Baruch appear to have been added in the Christian era, such as the last chapter: due to these insertions some scholars consider 4 Baruch to have Christian origins. Like the greater prophets, it advocates the divorce of foreign wives and exile of those who will not. According to 4 Baruch, the Samaritans are the descendants of such mixed marriages.
Content.
The Lord reveals to Jeremiah that Jerusalem will be destroyed because of the impiety of the Israelites. Jeremiah informs Baruch and at night they see angels that open the door to the city. In that night Jeremiah is instructed by the Lord to hide miraculously in the earth the vestments of the high-priest of the Temple. The Chaldeans enter Jerusalem and Jeremiah follows the Israelites to be exiled, while Baruch remains in Jerusalem and Abimelech (= Ebedmelech the Ethiopian of Jeremiah 38:7) falls asleep for 66 years and awakens with the basket of figs preserved perfectly fresh. When he awakens, Abimelech understands that he slept miraculously for years because the figs are fresh out-of-season. After the re-union with Baruch, they want to communicate with Jeremiah, who is still in Babylon. Baruch prays to the Lord and the Lord sends him an eagle that brings a letter and some of the figs to Jeremiah. The eagle finds Jeremiah officiating at a funeral and alights on the corpse, bringing it back to life, and announcing the end of the exile. The Israelites return to Jerusalem, but only those men who have no foreign wives are allowed to pass the Jordan.
History of the Babylonian Captivity.
This Jewish pseudepigraphical text belongs to the cycle of Baruch and is related to "4 Baruch".
It is longer and probably older than "4 Baruch". It has very few and circumscribed Christian insertions and it hasn't the fable-like style of "4 Baruch". Abimelech's sleep is here of 70 years, the usual duration of the Babylonian captivity.
The original Greek is lost, but we have Sahidic Coptic manuscripts and, even if less ancient, Arabic Garshuni manuscripts

<doc id="18733104" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18733104" title="The Wreckers (opera)">
The Wreckers (opera)

The Wreckers is an opera in three acts, composed by Dame Ethel Smyth to a libretto in French by Henry Brewster. After spending considerable energy in trying to get the work performed in French, the first performance took place in a German translation by John Bernhoff, under the title of "Strandrecht", at the Neues Theater, Leipzig on 11 November 1906.
Symth persisted in her attempts to see it staged elsewhere, but it was not until the conductor Thomas Beecham championed the work that a complete, staged performance was achieved in England in 1909.
Describing the opera in the "New Grove Dictionary", Stephen Banfield notes "Its greatest strength is in its dramatic strategy, strikingly prophetic of (Britten's) "Peter Grimes" in details such as the offstage church service set against the foreground confontation in Act 1."
However, Amanda Holden makes the point that, musically, Smyth is "no Wagnerite, she makes use of his motivic technique, while the texture, orchestration, and even some of the music's dramatic density, show knowledge of the works of Richard Strauss ... but it also slips too readily into operatic convention."
Composition history.
Old tales of Cornish villages where, on stormy nights, the inhabitants lured passing sailing ships onto to the rugged Atlantic coast were commonplace in the nineteenth century. The cargoes plundered were regarded as legitimate reward for the hardships endured in this isolated and barren part of the country. 
Therefore, when looking for a suitable theme for her third opera, it is little wonder that Smyth's thoughts should turn to this dramatic, yet romantic subject. It was after a taking a walking tour in Cornwall in 1886 that the idea came to her and, for several years, Smyth visited places where shipwrecks were said to have been engineered and interviewing anyone with evidence or memories of the wreckers.
Eventually she passed her notes on to Henry Brewster, a close personal friend and writer, to prepare the libretto. Although an American by birth, he had been brought up in France and it was agreed that libretto should be in French, partly because Brewster was happier working in French, but also it was felt that there was a more realistic chance of the work being produced in France or Belgium than in England. 
Smyth encountered considerable difficulty in getting this work published; her persistence in doing so was very commendable, notes Charles Reid: "For five years Ethel Smyth, wearing mannish tweeds and an assertively cocked felt hat, had been striding about Europe, cigar in mouth, trying to sell her opera "The Wreckers" to timorous or stubborn impresarios."
Performance history.
Unfortunately all attempts to have the opera premiered in the French-speaking world came to nothing, and Smyth was forced to fall back on personal contacts in Leipzig, where she had studied, to get the work performed in an inferior German translation. Severe cuts were insisted on by the conductor, particularly in the third act, which Smyth felt was turned into an "incomprehensible jumble". Despite a successful first night (the opera received 16 curtain calls) and general critical approval, Smyth immediately withdrew the opera and took it to Prague where she hoped for a more sympathetic production. Regrettably the opera fared even worse than at its first performance, and a disappointed Smyth returned to England.
With Beecham's support, the opera was given at Her Majesty's Theatre on 22 June 1909. Smyth was actually upset at the way Beecham conducted the rehearsals themselves, which were crammed into 10 days and nights. Beecham also included "The Wreckers" in his first Covent Garden season in 1910. In 1907 Gustav Mahler was considering the opera for a production at the Vienna State Opera, which would have been a very prestigious première for Smyth. Smyth said of Mahler, "He was far and away the finest conductor I ever knew, with the most all-embracing musical instinct, and it is one of the small tragedies of my life that just when he was considering "The Wreckers" at Vienna they drove him from office." 
Thereafter performances have been occasional, at best. Rare stage performances have taken place in England since 1939, but "The Wreckers" was performed by Duchy Opera at the Hall for Cornwall in 2006 to mark the opera's centenary and its first performance in Cornwall. This production was conducted by Paul Drayton and directed by David Sulkin. The libretto for this production was adapted by Amanda Holden. A concert performance was included in the Proms in 1994. It was most recently performed in concert performance by the American Symphony Orchestra in September 2007, marking its United States premiere.
Synopsis.
Act 1.
"A Cornish fishing village. Sunday evening"
On their way to chapel, villagers are drinking outside the tavern. Pascoe, the lay preacher, arrives and chastises them for taking alcohol on the Sabbath. He declares that this is why the Lord has stopped sending them ships to plunder. Lawrence, the lighthouse keeper, has another explanation: he has seen beacons burning on the cliffs and is certain someone is warning ships of the danger. The villagers vow to find the traitor in their midst and destroy him.
Mark, one of the younger fishermen, has been courting Avis, who is the daughter of the lighthouse keeper. His affections however, have now turned towards Thirza, the young wife of Pascoe. Unaware that Avis is spying on him, he serenades his new love while the other villagers are in the chapel, and to Avis's jealous fury it is clear that his amorous feelings for Thirza are fully returned.
The villagers leave the chapel inspired by Pascoe's fiery sermon to commit further bloody acts of plunder. The preacher upbraids his wife for not attending the service, but Thirza retorts that she can no longer endure life in the village and the merciless ways of the wreckers.
Pascoe is left alone with his thoughts. A storm is brewing and a ship is being drawn onto the rocks. Excitedly, the men of the village anticipate the rich pickings soon coming their way.
To everyone's amazement Avis returns and denounces Pascoe as the traitor who has been warning the ships of danger. The men agree to keep a close watch on the preacher as they begin their preparations for the grim work ahead.
Act 2.
"A desolate seashore at the base of the cliffs"
Mark is collecting flotsam and driftwood. He is in fact the one responsible for the warning beacons. Just as he is about to set light to his bonfire using the flame of his torch he hears Thirza calling. She hurries to his side and warns him that other villagers are close by and that if he lights the fire they will see the flames and come to trap him. 
The lovers embrace. At first Mark is intent on lighting his beacon, but when Thirza declares her love for him he stops, realizing he is putting her in danger as well as himself. Mark begs her to leave Pascoe and run away with him. She is reluctant at first, but gradually yields to his pleading. Triumphantly together they seize the torch and ignite the bonfire.
Pascoe arrives just in time to see the lovers making their escape. For a moment he sees his wife's face in the moonlight and in a state of anguish collapses on the beach. He is still unconscious when Avis and the men from the village arrive. Finding Pascoe near the beacon they are certain that he is the traitor.
Act 3.
"The interior of a large cave"
An impromptu court has been convened and Lawrence has appointed himself as prosecutor since he was one of the men who discovered Pascoe, apparently red-handed. Pascoe refuses to acknowledge the court and ignores their questions. Avis declares that he is the victim of witchcraft, as he is clearly still under the spell of his young wife, Thirza.
The evidence seems clear. The crowd howl for Pascoe's death, but at that moment Mark bursts into their midst and confesses that he was the one who betrayed them. Thirza also steps forward to acknowledge her share of the guilt. Avis tries to save Mark by claiming he spent the night with her, but the lovers are determined to meet their fate together.
The verdict is inevitable. The lovers are to be left chained as the incoming tide gradually fills the cave. Once more Pascoe begs Thirza to repent, but she again rejects him, preferring to die with Mark. The villagers leave as the waters begin to rise and ecstatically the lovers face death in each other's arms.

Pulaski Park (Holyoke, Massachusetts)

Pulaski Park is a city park along the Connecticut River in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Originally called Prospect Park when it was laid out in 1884, it was given its present name in 1939 in honor of American Revolutionary War hero Casimir Pulaski, for whom there is a memorial in the park's center. The original park was designed by the Olmsted Brothers landscape design firm.
Description.
The park's northern border is a crescent-shaped stretch of the Connecticut River. The shore is lined by a long concrete wall (built 1905-1910), which is interrupted every ten feet by a squat pier, and by four lookouts that jut over the embankment. A concrete promenade runs along the wall, providing views of the river. The southern edge of the park abuts the properties that line the north side of St. Kolbe Street. South and east of the historic core of the park lies Feldman Park, an adjoining city property that consists primarily of sports fields. On the west end of the park is another small park area with tennis courts. The center of the park has a small garden enclosed by a wrought iron fence, in which is a boulder on which is mounted a bronze plaque memorializing Casimir Pulaski. The historic core of the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.
History.
When the city of Holyoke was laid out in the 1840s, the parcel of land that became the park was not immediately identified for use as such. The area, which did not have a defined use in early plans, became known as "The Patch", and was an area where Irish immigrant workers who built the city's canals and infrastructure built a shantytown. The grid of city streets ended at the area's southern boundary, a street named Prospect Street, as it was built out during the second half of the 19th century. Sometime between 1865 and 1884 the area was cleared of shanties, and informal use of the area as a park began. The city's many Irish residents referred to it as "Kerry Park", after County Kerry and the green views of the surrounding area the park afforded.
In 1884 the Holyoke Water Power Company, owner of the land, gave it to the city, and its formal existence as Prospect Park began. Between 1884 and 1898 the park's paths were laid out, and landscaping and planting took place. Features built in this time that have not survived include a bandstand and an ornamental pump house used to bring water up from a spring in the river embankment. The park edge along the river was lined with a wooden fence. In a 1901 review of the park, John C. Olmsted recommended the construction of a more permanent retaining wall with either wrought iron railing or stone parapet; this suggestion led to the construction of the existing concrete wall. Olmsted also recommended changes to the landscaping to improve the park's appearance.
During a phase of urban renewal in the 1960s, the area south of the park was redeveloped. The grid character of its streets was altered, with only Maple Street providing access from the street grid to the park. Prospect Street was removed at this time for the development of the properties that now abut the park.

Dhanaji Jadhav

Dhanaji Shambhusinha Jadhav (1650–1708), popularly known as Dhanaji Jadhav, was a warrior of the Maratha Empire. Along with Santaji Ghorpade he made terrifying campaigns against Mughal Army from 1689 to 1696. After Santaji, Dhanaji became the chief of the Maratha army in 1696 and remained on the post until his death in 1708.
Background.
Dhanaji was born in or around 1650, to the Jadhav family from Sindkhed, which claimed descent from the Yadavas of Devagiri. Dhanaji’s father Santaji was brought up by Shivaji’s mother Jijabai after assassination of Dhanaji's grandfather Achloji, Jijabai’s brother. Santaji’s son Shambhusinha (Sambhaji) also was brought up by Jijabai with her son Shivaji after Santaji's death at the Battle of Pavan Khind.
Early career.
At an early age, Dhanaji joined Maratha army under Shivaji’s Military Chief Prataprao Gujar. In the battles at Umbrani and Nesari, Dhanaji’s performance attracted attention of Shivaji for the first time. He was named by Shivaji on his death bed among six pillars of Maratha Empire who would save the kingdom in hard times.
Contribution to the Maratha War of Independence.
At the beginning of the Rajaram’s regime, Dhanaji was a "Pancha Hajari", a chief of 5,000 soldiers. In September 1689 along with Santaji Ghorpade, Dhanaji attacked Aurangzeb’s general Sheikh Nizam who had blockaded Maratha fort in Kohlapur Panhala. Nizam was dealt a severe beating and most of his supplies, horses and elephants were captured.
During 1689 – 1690, Santaji and Dhanaji were directed to prevent the Mughal army in Maharashtra to enter into Karnataka after Rajaram’s flight to Gingee. On 25 May 1690, Sarjahkhan alias Rustamkhan was defeated and captured near Satara by Ramchandra Pant Amatya, Shankaraji Narayan, Santaji and Dhanaji and this defeat proved to be a big blow to Aurangzeb. In the month of December in the same year, Santaji and Dhanaji were promoted and were placed respectively under the supervision of Ramchandra Pant Amatya and Shankaraji Narayan Sacheev.
In the last quarter of 1692, Dhanaji and Santaji were sent to Karnataka to beat back the Mughal blockade of the new Maratha capital of Gingee. On the way south to Karnataka on 8 October 1692, Dharwad was captured and annexed by 7000 Maratha soldiers under both of them. In December 1692, the Mughal army under Zulfikhar Ali Khan around fort Gingee was beaten soundly by Santaji and Dhanaji as a result of which Zulfikhar Ali Khan had to approach to king Rajaram for accommodation and compromise.
On 9 January 1693, Dhanaji captured Aurangazeb’s General Ismailkhan Makha, arrested him and took him to Gingee. After lengthy negotiations with Rajaram, Zulfikhar Ali Khan was granted a safe passage out in March 1693 which Santaji did not like. He argued with Rajaram and left the place without his permission as a result of which Dhanaji was given tentative charge of the army chief. Santaji, however, soon resumed his duties.
In September 1695 during a great battle against the Mughals at Chandan Vandan, Dhanaji lost one of his sons on the battlefield. On 20 November 1695, Kasimkhan; Aurangzeb’s powerful General in Karnataka, was attacked, defeated and killed by Santaji and Dhanaji at Doderi near Chitradurga.
In December 1695, Dhanaji was defeated in a battle near Vellore by Zulfikhar Ali Khan. In June 1696, by order of Rajaram, Dhanaji attacked Santaji for his rebellion near Vriddhachalam but was forced to retreat. Soon thereafter Santaji was officially sacked and his charge was given to Dhanaji again.
In March 1697, Dhanaji defeated Santaji at Dahigaon with the help of Hanmantrao Nimbalkar.
Later career and death.
In 1700 after the death of Rajaram, his illegitimate son Raja Karna was placed on his throne by his Ministers with the help of Dhanaji. However, Raja Karna died of smallpox within 3 weeks.
In November 1703, Aurangzeb opened talks with Dhanaji through his son Kambaksh to handover Shahu to him. The talks, however, could not succeed due to the so-called extravagant demands by Dhanaji made on behalf of the Maratha king. 
In 1705, Maratha army containing about 40,000 soldiers headed by Dhanaji, Dado Malhar and Rambhaji Nimbalkar smashed into Surat and looted entire region of Gujrat up to Bharoch.
Dhanaji also vanquished the Mughal army under Nazar Ali, the Nawab of Baroda, at Ratanpur and brought huge treasure to Maharashtra. In 1708, with mediation by his assistant Balaji Vishwanath (who would later become Peshwa in 1713) Dhanaji left Tarabai and joined hands with Shahu at Khed. Soon thereafter he died. Subsequently, his son Chandrasen was placed on his post. A monument to Dhanaji Jadhav is in Peth Vadgaon town in Kolhapur district.
In popular culture.
A Marathi film Dhanya Te Santaji Dhanaji directed by Dinkar D. Patil starring Chandrakant and Suryakant was released in 1968. This film is about Dhanaji Jadhav and Santaji Ghorpade.

Free Range Studios

Free Range Studios is a messaging firm based in Washington, D.C. and Oakland, California. Free Range works with companies and organizations to create story-based brands, producing media in various formats from interactive and mobile to print and video. They are known for their creative services and films promoting social change.
Beginnings.
Free Range Studios was founded by Jonah Sachs and Louis Fox in 1999 as Free Range Graphics. Sachs and Fox had been childhood collaborators on amateur film and video projects.
After years of experimenting with various media, the pair decided to form a print design firm, working exclusively for non-profits who promoted social change. Within six months of its founding, Free Range was working on national campaigns for Earthjustice, SEIU, and Amnesty International.
Free Range began offering poster and brochure design, identities, annual reports and website design.
New media.
In early 2000, Earthjustice, a national environmental group, approached Free Range with an idea to create a short internet cartoon about the problem of mountain top removal in West Virginia. Using Flash Animation, a rudimentary 40 second cartoon was produced. The movie explained, in cartoon format, about the problem with mountain top removal mining and then offered users the opportunity to take action to stop it.
Though simple, this type of viral activism animation was new at the time, and the novelty of it got the attention of both the general public and the social activism community. Soon, requests for similar work began coming in on several critical issues.
Later that year, Free Range delivered its first Flash animation piece that would have worldwide impact. Amnesty International wanted to pressure Congress to ban "dirty diamonds" which were mined in war zones and carried the weight of human rights abuses. Free Range developed a 90 second ad that spoofed the famous De Beers shadow hands TV spot, showing the harm dirty diamonds did to African people. The piece was distributed on the internet and on DVD to members of the United States Congress. De Beers, the campaign's target, took notice, showing it at a leadership meeting; 500,000 viewers watched the movie online and soon after Congress passed a Clean Diamonds act. Within two years, the loss of dirty diamond funding contributed to the end of Sierra Leone's civil war.
Expansion.
By 2003, Free Range was creating visual identities and conference materials for groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), International Campaign for Tibet and Annie Casey's Kids Count. The web team was also creating websites for Greenpeace, Heifer International and The Harvard Civil Rights project.
The Meatrix.
Free Range came into the public consciousness in 2003 with the release of The Meatrix, the result of a Free Range "Gratitude Grant" awarded to the Global Resource Action Center for the Environment (GRACE). Sachs and Fox had long been passionate about fighting factory farming and chose GRACE's factory farming campaign as a way of lending their support to this cause. The Meatrix, which was released the same week as The Matrix Revolutions, features Leo the Pig and Moopheus the Bull exploring the world of a factory farm. The movie, which took a humorous approach to the issue, was a success. It has been viewed over 15 million times, translated into over 30 languages, and featured in news outlets from the "New York Times" to CNN.
Evolution of the firm.
In 2003, they expanded their client list beyond non-profits to include socially responsible businesses and political campaigns. 
By 2004 Free Range was heavily involved in the political arena. After creating viral advertising for Howard Dean's primary campaign, the team was hired by John Kerry for President to help in the general election. Free Range built a suite of web advertisements, print materials and interactive web features to help with an online campaign. Also that year, Free Range created the online documentary Beyond the Fire which would be featured at Sundance and take home the Best Educational Site award at the South by Southwest festival.
In 2005, Free Range created its first live action short, Store Wars, which took on the issue of organic food. The vegetable puppetry 5-minute video was seen over 10 million times online and was reported on in newspapers and television across the country. That year, Sachs left DC to join Fox in California and opened a second office for the firm in Berkeley. By that year, the team reached 20 members and modified its service offering to include interactive games, complete print and identity design, web-effectiveness consulting and campaign strategy services.
Books.
In July 2012, Free Range Studios founder Jonah Sachs published his first book with Harvard Business Review Press entitled "Winning the Story Wars: Why Those Who Tell -- and Live -- the Best Stories Will Rule the Future". In "Winning the Story Wars", Sachs argues that brands that tell value-driven stories can truly revolutionize marketing. 
Gratitude Grant.
Each year, the Free Range Gratitude Grant gives free services to organizations with ideas to create maximum impact. Free Range also hosts "green design" events and actively researches and educates on next-generation web advocacy strategies.

Joanna Hiffernan

Joanna "Jo" Hiffernan (ca. 1843 – after 1903) was an Irish artists' model and muse who was romantically linked with American painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler and French painter Gustave Courbet.
Early life.
Hiffernan was a Roman Catholic. Her father, Patrick Hiffernan, is described by Whistler's friends, Joseph Pennell and his wife Elizabeth, as being like "Captain Costigan," the drunken Irishman in Thackeray's novel "Pendennis". The Pennells also described him as "a teacher of polite chirography (calligraphy)" who used to speak of Whistler as "me son-in-law." Her mother, Katherine Hiffernan, died in 1862, aged 44. Joanna Hiffernan had a sister called Bridget Agnes Hiffernan, later Singleton. The artist Walter Greaves, who began tuition with Whistler in 1863, and who knew Hiffernan well, claimed that she had a son called Harry but no trace of him can be found in official records.
Artist's model.
Whistler first met Hiffernan in 1860 while she was at a studio in Rathbone Place, and she went on to have a 6-year relationship with him, during which period she modelled for some of his most famous paintings. Physically striking, Hiffernan's personality was even more impressive. Whistler's biographers and friends, the Pennells, wrote of her, "She was not only beautiful. She was intelligent, she was sympathetic. She gave Whistler the constant companionship he could not do without."
Whistler's family did not approve of Hiffernan, as unmarried artists' models, and especially those who posed nude, were considered at that time to be little better than prostitutes. However, Hiffernan seems only to have modelled for friends, so perhaps the objections to her made by Whistler's family were based more on social class than on Hifferman's personal character. When Whistler's mother visited from America in 1864, alternative accommodation had to be found for Hiffernan, who also seems to have been the cause of Whistler's quarrel with Alphonse Legros in 1863.
She was in France with Whistler during the summer of 1861, and while in Paris during the winter of 1861–62 she sat for "Symphony in White, No. I: The White Girl" at a studio in "Boulevard des Batignolles" and in 1864–65 she posed for . It is possible that this is when she met Whistler's friend and fellow artist, Gustave Courbet, for whom she later modelled. There is some thought -recently confirmed by experts who found another part of the picture showing the woman's head- that she was the model for Courbet's "L'Origine du monde", which depicts a nude woman's vulva.
Hiffernan attended séances with Whistler at Dante Gabriel Rossetti's house in Chelsea in 1863, and spent the summer and autumn of 1865 in Trouville with Whistler. In 1866, Whistler gave Hiffernan power of attorney over his affairs while he was in Valparaiso for seven months, making provision for household expenses and giving her the authority to act as an agent in the sale of his works.
During Whistler's absence, Hiffernan travelled to Paris and posed for Courbet in "The Sleepers", or "Le Sommeil" which depicts two naked women in bed asleep. It is likely that she had an affair with Courbet at this time, After the end of his relationship with Hiffernan, Whistler left a will in her favour.
In addition to being an artists' model, Hiffernan herself also drew and painted.
Later years.
After she and Whistler parted, Hiffernan helped to raise Whistler's son, Charles James Whistler Hanson (1870–1935), the result of an affair with a parlour maid, Louisa Fanny Hanson. He lived with Hiffernan at 5 Thistle Grove as late as 1880 when Whistler was away in Venice with Maud Franklin, his then mistress. The 1881 English census recorded Hiffernan, her sister Bridget and Charles Hanson as visitors of Charles Singleton (whom Bridget would later marry) at 2 Thistle Grove.
Little is known of Hiffernan after 1880. A woman reported to Juliette Courbet (1831–1915), the sister of Gustave Courbet, in a letter of 18 December 1882, that "the beautiful Irish girl" was in Nice, where she sold antiques and some pictures by Courbet. It is believed that Hiffernan married a man named Abbot some time after 1881, possibly on the Continent.
The art collector Charles Lang Freer met Hiffernan when he was a pallbearer at Whistler's funeral in 1903 when she came forward in heavy mourning to pay her last respects. His fellow art patron Louisine Havemeyer (1855–1929) later recorded the incident as she heard it from Freer:"As she raised her veil and I saw ... the thick wavy hair, although it was streaked with grey, I knew at once it was Johanna, the Johanna of Etretat, 'la belle Irlandaise' that Courbet had painted with her wonderful hair and a mirror in her hand... She stood for a long time beside the coffin—nearly an hour I should think... I could not help being touched by the feeling she showed toward her old friend. "Did Maud come?" [Havemeyer asked. "Yes" answered Mr. Freer, "the same afternoon. She had come all the way from Paris and was very much affected as I uncovered Whistler's face for her to see him." ... could see, Freer mused "that the real drama of life was bound up in the love of [these devoted women."

Clovis Robert Block

The Clovis Robert Block is a historic mixed-use commercial and residential block at 338-348 Main Street (the corner of Cabot Street) in south Holyoke, Massachusetts. The four story brick building was built in 1881 for Clovis Robert, an expatriate French Canadian, and expanded in 1888, both to an early design of Holyoke architect George P. B. Alderman. It was built during a period of major migration by French Canadians to the area, seeking work in the local mills. When built it offered two storefronts on Cabot Street and three on Main Street, with the upper floors containing fifteen residential units. The interior of the building has retained little of its original character: the commercial spaces were extensively altered over the years, and the apartments above suffered from neglect and vandalism.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Caherline GAA

Caherline GAA (Irish: "Cathair Laighin") is a Gaelic Athletic Association hurling club based in County Limerick, Ireland. It is based in the parish of Caherline/Caherconlish in the east division of Limerick GAA.
History.
The club was founded in 1884, making it one of the oldest clubs in county Limerick. The early years of the club were its most successful, winning the Limerick Senior Hurling Championship on three occasions; 1896, 1905 and 1907. Caherline also lost two county finals in this period; in 1898 (When a lack of crowd control caused the match to be abandoned) and in 1908.
By the 1920s Caherline had slipped back to the junior ranks but returned to the limelight in 1927 when winning their first Limerick Junior Hurling Championship by beating Kilmallock in the county final. This was followed by a second junior title in 1931, when once again Kilmallock were beaten in the final.
The club went through lean times after this and were not to appear in another county final until 1974 when Glenroe were the victors in the county junior hurling final. Defeat was to be Caherline's lot once again in the 2001 county junior hurling final, losing out to Newcastlewest. These heartbreaking defeats were consigned to history however, when in 2007 Caherline bridged a 76-year gap and claimed their third junior hurling championship title defeating Effin in the county final.
In 2008 the club played in the county intermediate hurling championship for the first time and exceeded expectations by reaching the county final. However Bruff were to be the victors on this occasion, winning on a scoreline of 3-14 to 0-15 in Ballyagran on October 12, 2008.

Julia Sanderson Theater

The Julia Sanderson Theater (originally and currently known as The Paramount Theater; recently and formerly known as The Hippodrome) is an historic theater at 1676-1708 Main Street in Springfield, Massachusetts, (although generally listed at 1700 Main Street.) Built in 1926 out of part of the grand Massasoit Hotel at a cost of over $1 million, the Paramount Theater was the most ornate picture palace in Western Massachusetts. As of 2011, The Paramount is in the midst of a $1.725 million renovation to once again become a theater after decade as a disco and concert hall, (the Hippodrome,) when it was the center of Springfield's club scene. 
History.
From 1926 until the 1960s, The Paramount changed names several times - including a brief stint as the Julia Sanderson Theater, honoring a famous actress from Springfield - however, it remained a movie theater until the 1960s, when it began to find use as a mixed use venue for movies, rock concerts, and other live performances. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
In 1999, the venue was purchased and restored by Steven Stein and Michael Barrasso of Paramount Realty Investment LLC. At that time, it was turned into a lavish nightclub and performance space. The venue's main floor seats were removed; however, the 1,100 balcony seats were retained and restored. The theater underwent a $1.3 million renovation in 1999, and was reopened as the Hippodrome Theater. The original organ was restored and the marquee was changed to reflect the theater's new name.
The Hippodrome became a popular nightclub and concert venue during the 2000s. In 2011, the theater was purchased by the New England Farm Worker's Council. As of 2011, the Paramount Theater is in the midst of a $1.725 million renovation to once again become a theater and performance space.

Smith's Building

Smith's Building is a historic commercial building at 201-207 Worthington Street in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. The five story building was built in 1897, and first occupied by the McIntosh Corporation, a major area shoe manufacturer. McIntosh occupied the premises until 1913, when it moved into a new building at Chestnut and Worthington. The next major tenant was Fred Smith, who moved his recreation center business there.
Fred Smith began his billiard and bowling business on an adjacente block in 1903. He acquired a number of billiard tables from the 1904 St. Louis Exposition, and installed them on the second floor of this building. On the upper floors he installed a bowling alley, with seven lanes of candlepins on each of the third and fourth floors, and eight on the fifth. The lanes were removed due to declining popularity and moved to a bowling alley in Connecticut. The pool hall is still in business.
The building is five story brick construction. The ground floor has glass storefronts. The second floor facade is shown as a mezzanine level, with five windows separated by brick piers. The upper three floor fronts are divided into five bays, each with two windows, separated by piers and topped by a decorative arch. The facade is topped by a corbelled cornice and pierced parapet.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Ryan Taylor (wrestler)

Russell "Ryan" Gene Taylor (born January 26, 1987) is an American professional wrestler, who is currently working for several independent wrestling promotions on the west coast of the United States and continues to travel outside the country to Mexico City and Japan. He also does much work with the WWE while never being under contract.
Professional wrestling career.
Empire Wrestling Federation.
Debut; Cruiserweight Champion (2004-2007).
At 16 years old he began training at the EWF's training school, Jesse Hernandez's School of Hard Knocks and had his match for the EWF on March 27, 2004. Taylor wrestled to gain experience and won the 2004 Rookie of the year award in the company. In the spring of 2006 Taylor had his first feud with Joey Harder and after a series of hard matches, Taylor won the EWF Cruiserweight Championship on June 9, 2006. Taylor also won the 2006 Most Improved Award, becoming the first recipient of it. Taylor's reign as the Cruiserweight Champion lasted for 399 days until ending on July 13, 2007 when Markus Riot defeated Taylor in a Best of 3 Falls match to win the EWF Cruiserweight Championship. Ryan won back the EWF Cruiserweight Championship by ending Markous Riot's reign after only 22 days. At EFW's "Meltdown", Taylor forced Riot to submit to win back the title. Taylor's second reign as the EWF Cruiserweight Champion only 77 days until October 10, 2007 when Maximo defeated Ryan Taylor to win the EWF Cruiserweight Championship. In November, Ryan Taylor competed in the EWF's Inland Title Series Tournament against J.T. Blackstar, Scorpio Sky, and Brandon Gatson. He placed third with a final score of 1-2-0. Taylor also won the 2007 Match of the Year Award for his match against Marcus Riot at the Covina Classic on June 9.
The KOS (2008-2009).
In the early part of 2008 Taylor formed a stable known as the KOS alongside Mondo Vega and Hook Bomberry. On August 23, 2008 in San Bernardino, California, Taylor defeated Vizzion in the main event at "Flirting With Disaster" for the EWF American Championship and had new female wrestler Aiden Riley join the KOS as well. The KOS then feuded with TJ Perkins and Liger Rivera until the end of the year in a very intense feud that not only won the Feud of the Year 2008 Award but Taylor would win the Match of the Year 2008 Award for his Belt on a Pole match against Perkins in which Taylor would win the NWA Heritage Championship from Perkins. Taylor also wrestled the main event of the first ever So-cal supershow featuring the combined companies of EWF and AWS against TJ Perkins and Scott Lost in a triple threat match for the AWS Heavyweight and Light Heavyweight Championships and Taylor's NWA Heritage Championship, in which Taylor retained his title. Taylor held and defended both the EWF American Championship and the NWA Heritage Championship in the early parts of 2009 until losing the Heritage title to Oliver John in a Fatal 4-way match at the main event of the Cauliflower Ally Club Show after pinning Chris Hero and he lost the American title to Liger Rivera at the EWF's 14th Anniversary Show.
EWF Heavyweight Championship (2009-2011).
On October 30, 2009, after returning from Japan and being set on climbing the EWF to the top, Taylor defeated Brandon Gatson to win the EWF Heavyweight Championship. Taylor began to feud with his former stable the KOS in late 2009 and the early parts of 2010, ultimately ending with a Street Fight between Taylor and Mondo Vega, that ended the KOS as Taylor prevailed. During his 567 reign as EWF Heavyweight Champion, he would successfully defended his title 25 times against some of the independents top talent including Human Tornado and Scorpio Sky as well as EWF talent such as Extreme Loco, HJ Starr, Liger Rivera, Mike Mountain, Roger Ruiz, Shaun Ricker, SoCal Crazy and Terex. On May 20, 2011 Taylor lost the EWF Heavyweight Championship to Johnny Starr. However, several weeks later on August 12, he would regain the championship, only to lose it 21 days later to Shaun Ricker. Taylor participated in Inland Title Series Tournament in November and made it to the finals but lost to Jeremy Jaeger.
Championship Wrestling from Hollywood (2008-present).
Taylor made his debut for NWA Championship Wrestling from Hollywood on December 21, 2008, defeating Jay Streets. During the early years of the promotion, Taylor was used sporadically but that would change in 2011 when he would become a regular competitor. Taylor began feuding with Peter Avalon in April and would continue throughout the year and into 2012. Avalon initially had the upper hand winning two out of two matches, however, Taylor's fortunes would change on July 10 when he defeated Avalon in a six man tag team hair vs. hair match where Avalon and Taylor's hair were on the line. Avalon would bounce back by defeating Taylor in a number one contendership match and an "anything goes" match. The feud culminated on February 12, 2012, when Taylor defeated Avalon once and for all in a steel cage match.
With this win, Taylor would go on to challenge Scorpio Sky for the NWA Hollywood Television Championship in April but lost. He would move onto the Percy Pringle III Cup where on the way to the finals, he defeated Peter Avalon once again. The finals took place on July 22, where Taylor would win the tournament by defeating Shaun Ricker and guaranteeing a shot at the CWFH Heritage Heavyweight Championship. After winning the tournament, Championship Wrestling from Hollywood split from NWA and would subsequently change the name of there championships so the CWFH Heritage Heavyweight Championship became the Hollywood Heritage Championship. In the beginning of 2013, Taylor defeated Tyler Cintron in a qualifying match for the Red Carpet Rumble. This match took place on May 5, where Shaun Ricker would win the match and the Hollywood Heritage Championship. Straight after the match however, Taylor cashed in his Percy Pringle III Cup title shot and lost.
Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2009-2012).
On November 20, 2009, Taylor made his Pro Wrestling Guerrilla debut at the first night of the 2009 Battle of Los Angeles, where he teamed with Malachi Jackson in a losing effort against the Cutler Brothers (Brandon and Dustin Cutler). Taylor continued to perform on every PWG show since, including having a standout and stellar match against Brandon Gatson at "Titannica" and teaming with Roderick Strong at the DDT4 tournament in May 2010, where they were eliminated in the first round by the Cutler Brothers. On September 4 Taylor entered the 2010 Battle of Los Angeles, but was eliminated in the first round by Brandon Gatson. The following day Taylor formed a new alliance with Chuck Taylor and Brian Cage (who would adopt the ring name Brian Cage-Taylor), called the Fightin' Taylor Boys. In the early portion of 2011, Fightin' Taylor Boys lost a number one conders corners match and partook in the Joey Ryan invatational and lost. The Fightin' Taylor Boys lost to the RockNES Monsters in the first round of the 2012 DDT4.

Thomas and Esther Smith House

Thomas and Esther Smith House is a historic house at 251 North West Street in Agawam, Massachusetts. It is one of the oldest houses in Agawam. The house is situated on of land about west of the Connecticut River, at the foot of Provin Mountain. It is a vernacular 1.5 story house with plain Georgian styling. The main block of the house is three bays wide, with a gambrel roof and a central chimney. A 1.5 story addition on the western side of the house as a gabled roof. The main block's foundation is fieldstone, while that of the addition is brick and concrete block.
Inside the house, the main block follows a fairly standard Georgian four-room plan. A vestibule with a dogleg stair separates a hall and a parlor in the front, and the rear is divided asymmetrically into a large kitchen space and a small bedroom. Fireplaces open from the central chimney onto the hall, parlor and kitchen. The kitchen fireplace is particularly deep, and includes a bake oven (now coated with a layer of concrete) at its rear, rather than a more typical placement on the side. The upstairs of the main block is divided into four bedrooms, all with very basic finishing work. The exterior walls and ceilings are plastered, while the interior walls which separate them are either plastered or of simple wood construction.
The addition, built c. 1930s, is accessed from the small bedroom space, and includes a kitchen space that dates roughly to the period of its construction. The kitchen is at the level of the main part of the house, but a doorway leads to stairs going up and down to rooms in the rest of the addition, which were laid out to provide a separate living space.
The construction date of the house is uncertain, and is believed to have been sometime before 1758, when a deed mentions the home of one George Mixer on this parcel of land. The purchaser of the land, Thomas Smith, was a carpenter and housewright, and may have been this house's builder. Tree ring dating places some of the house's structural elements somewhat later, circa 1790. The house was built using a plank framing method that is distinctive to the Connecticut River valley.
The property remained in the Smith family until 1843. It was owned by the Park family until 1910, and then went through a succession of owners before its acquisition by the Agawam Historical Society in 2002. The house remained without modern amenities until the 1950s. It is now operated by the historical society as a house museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Captain Sky

Daryl L. Cameron (born July 10, 1957, Chicago, Illinois), better known as Captain Sky, is an American musician and singer. Captain Sky’s funk-based musical style, futuristic costumes, and psychedelic imagery are similar to those of George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, and other Parliament/Funkadelic projects. In the liner notes to the first Captain Sky album, Captain Sky’s origins are explained in this way: “Oh, by the way, if you’re wondering, Daryl Cameron somehow entered the phonebooth of his mind and emerged as Captain Sky. Tune in again.”
With a group of other Chicago-based musicians, Captain Sky began recording around 1978 and released "The Adventures of Captain Sky" in that year followed quickly by "Pop Goes The Captain" in 1979. Both albums were released by AVI Records. Several singles were released from these albums, most notably “Wonder Worm” and “Super Sporm.” By 1980, Captain Sky had moved to TEC records and on that imprint released his third album "Concerned Party #1". After several more singles, "The Return of Captain Sky", his final album was released in 1981 back on AVI records. Since that time, Captain Sky has released singles sporadically on various labels and older tracks have been included on various compilations.

Colautti v. Franklin

Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979) was a United States Supreme Court abortion rights case, which held void for vagueness part of Pennsylvania's 1974 Abortion Control Act. The section in question was the following:
(a) Every person who performs or induces an abortion shall prior thereto have made a determination based on his experience, judgment or professional competence that the fetus is not viable, and if the determination is that the fetus is viable or if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable, shall exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted and the abortion technique employed shall be that which would provide the best opportunity for the fetus to be aborted alive so long as a different technique would not be necessary in order to preserve the life or health of the mother.
Doctors who failed to adhere to the provisions of this section were liable to civil and criminal prosecution "as would pertain to him had the fetus been a child who was intended to be born and not aborted." Franklin and others sued, arguing that the provision was both vague and overbroad. In a 6-3 decision written by "Roe" author Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court agreed, finding that requiring a determination "if... the fetus is viable or if there is sufficient reason to believe the fetus may be viable" was insufficient and impermissibly vague guidance for physicians who might face criminal liability if a jury disagrees with their judgment.

The Son of Dr. Jekyll

The Son of Dr. Jekyll is a 1951 American historical horror film directed by Seymour Friedman and starring Louis Hayward, Jody Lawrance, Lester Matthews and Alexander Knox. Financed and distributed by Columbia Pictures, it is based on a screenplay by Jack Pollexfen and Mortimer Braus. The film is a continuation of Robert Louis Stevenson's original classic novel "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", although bearing some differences to the horror classic. 
"Son of Dr. Jekyll" is considered to be an unofficial sequel to the 1941 adaptation of the novel, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" starring Spencer Tracy, although the two films have a number of plot differences. The main difference is that Jekyll the father survives long enough to marry and have a son which is neither of the earlier film adaptations. Also a Hyde character only appears briefly when the true chemicals that Jekyll the father used rather than the non-functional chemicals listed in the altered notebook and never again in the film.
Jack Pollexfen, the scriptwriter of this film, wrote and produced a further sequel in the same vein, "The Daughter of Dr. Jekyll" in 1957 starring Gloria Talbott.
Plot summary.
The film begins with a prologue set in 1860, where Mr. Hyde is chased down in the streets of London, after murdering his wife at their Soho flat. He escapes to the house of Dr. Jekyll, where he prepares the potion that will transform him back to the respected doctor. Unfortunately, the mob has already set the house ablaze. The flames drive Hyde at the top floor, and in attempt to leap to the ground, he meets his demise when he falls to the ground. As he dies, he changes back to Dr. Jekyll.
John Utterson and Dr. Lanyon (original characters from Stevenson's novel) mourn their unfortunate friend Dr. Jekyll, until Inspector Stoddard brings the two to the Soho flat, where Jekyll/Hyde has left an orphan behind. Utterson agrees to adopt the young Jekyll, since he and his wife haven't succeeded in having children. Thirty years later, Edward Jekyll, now fiance to Utterson's niece Lynn and a student of Royal Academy of Science, is expelled from the academy because of his peculiar and unorthodox experiments. Edward is unaware that he is actually Henry Jekyll's son, and when he inherits the Jekyll Mansion, Dr. Lanyon tells him his tragic father's story. 
Edward and Lynn move to the old Jekyll Mansion for the preparations of their marriage, and soon, Edward feels unwelcome by his neighbors. Discovering his father's laboratory, Edward convinces himself to work on his father's experiments in order to clear the Jekyll name. He hires Michaels, Dr. Jekyll's old assistant, and begins researching. Unfortunately, after Edward first tests the formula on himself, a Hyde-like man appears in the house and murders a number of people. Edward is charged for the murders, and thought insane, is transferred to Dr. Lanyon's sanitarium where the murders continue. Edward begins wondering if it is him who transforms into a murderer, or someone else is trying to drive him to insanity.
It was shown clearly that Edward's adoptive father changed chemicals and his father's notebook to punish Edward for abandoning him and embracing his biological father's heritage despite raising Edward as his own son.

<doc id="18733230" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18733230" title="Leading-edge slats">
Leading-edge slats

Slats are aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings of fixed-wing aircraft which, when deployed, allow the wing to operate at a higher angle of attack. A higher coefficient of lift is produced as a result of angle of attack and speed, so by deploying slats an aircraft can fly at slower speeds, or take off and land in shorter distances. They are usually used while landing or performing maneuvers which take the aircraft close to the stall, but are usually retracted in normal flight to minimize drag.
Types.
Types include:
Operation.
The chord of the slat is typically only a few percent of the wing chord. The slats may extend over the outer third of the wing, or they may cover the entire leading edge. Many early aerodynamicists, including Ludwig Prandtl believed that slats work by inducing a high energy stream to the flow of the main airfoil thus re-energizing its boundary layer and delaying stall. In reality, the slat does not give the air in the slot high velocity (it actually reduces its velocity) and also it cannot be called high-energy air since all the air outside the actual boundary layers has the same total heat. The actual effects of the slat are: 
The slat has a counterpart found in the wings of some birds, the alula, a feather or group of feathers which the bird can extend under control of its "thumb".
History.
Slats were first developed by Gustav Lachmann in 1918. A crash in August 1917, with a Rumpler C aeroplane on account of stalling caused the idea to be put in a concrete form, and a small wooden model was built in 1917 in Cologne. In 1918, Lachmann presented a patent for leading-edge slats in Germany. However, the German patent office at first rejected it as the office did not believe in the possibility of increasing lift by dividing the wing.
Independently of Lachmann, Handley-Page Ltd in Great Britain also developed the slotted wing as a way to postpone stall by reducing the turbulence over the wing at high angles of attack, and applied for a patent in 1919; to avoid a patent challenge, they reached an ownership agreement with Lachmann. That year a De Havilland D.H.9 was fitted with slats and flown. Later, a D.H.4 was modified as a monoplane with a large wing fitted with full span leading edge and back ailerons (i.e. what would later be called flaps) that could be deployed in conjunction with the leading-edge slats to test improved low speed performance. Several years later, having subsequently taken employment at the Handley-Page aircraft company, Lachmann was responsible for a number of aircraft designs, including the Handley Page Hampden.
Licensing the design became one of the company's major sources of income in the 1920s. The original designs were in the form of a fixed slot in the front of the wing, a design that was found on a number of STOL aircraft.
During World War II, German aircraft commonly fitted a more advanced version that pushed back flush against the wing by air pressure to reduce drag, popping out when the angle of attack increased during slower flight. Notable slats of that time belonged to the German Fieseler Fi 156 "Storch". These were similar in design to retractable slats, but were fixed non-retractable slots. The slotted wing allowed this aircraft to take off into a light wind in less than 45 m (150 ft), and land in 18 m (60 ft). Aircraft designed by the Messerschmitt company employed automatic, spring-loaded leading-edge slats as a general rule, except for the Alexander Lippisch-designed Messerschmitt Me 163 "Komet" rocket fighter, which used fixed slots in the wing panel's outer leading edges instead.
Post World War II, slats have generally been operated by hydraulics or electricity on larger aircraft.
Slats are one of several high-lift devices used on airliners, such as flap systems running along the trailing edge of the wing.
Research.
Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. One promising approach that could rival slats are flexible wings.
In flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing is a NASA effort. The Adaptive Compliant Wing is a military and commercial effort.

Charles Harry Bull (29 March 1909 – 28 May 1939) was an English cricketer who played 175 first-class matches between 1929 and 1939, first for Kent and later for Worcestershire.
After having made a number of appearances for Kent's Second XI in the late 1920s, Bull made his first-class debut against Surrey in July 1929; he scored 23 in his only innings and sent down three overs for 19.
He played a further two first-class games that season, and another one in 1930, but had no success and left the county at the end of the season.
Bull's Worcestershire debut came against the New Zealanders in May 1931, when opening the batting he scored just 8 and 6,
but his career for his new county truly began in 1933.
In that year he made 25 appearances, scoring 743 runs at 21.85, though his highest score was only 79.
The four seasons from 1934 to 1937 were the best years of Bull's career. He passed a thousand runs in each season, making five centuries, the highest of these being the first: 161 against Glamorgan in June 1934.
His most productive summer was that of 1937, when he hit 1,619 runs and hit two centuries, this being the only season of his career in which he reached three figures more than once.
Bull played 15 times in 1938, but passed 50 only thrice and scored under 500 runs in the season. In late May 1939, during the weekend of the match against Essex at Chelmsford, he was killed in a car accident which also left his team-mate Syd Buller injured.

Stacy Building

The Stacy Building is a historic building at 41-43 Taylor Street in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the district of Metro Center known as the Club Quarter. On September 20, 1893, Springfielders Charles and Frank Duryea road-tested the first-ever American-built, gasoline-powered car in Springfield, which they had built at the Stacy Building. The first Duryea Motor Wagons were all built by hand at the Stacy Building on Taylor Street in Springfield. Despite the September 20 road-test on Howard Bemis's Springfield farm, the "Springfield Republican" newspaper did get the story until the Duryea brothers' 2nd public road-test on November 10, 1893.
In 1895, the Duryea Motor Wagon won America's first-ever road race - a 54 mile race from Chicago to Evanston, Illinois, beating out European companies like Daimler Benz. Following this, demand for Duryea automobiles soared. In 1896, the Duryea Motor Wagon Company became the first company to manufacture and sell gasoline-powered automobiles. The Duryea Brothers produced thirteen cars by hand in the company's first year - all at the Stacy Building. The company's motto was "there is no better motorcar." Immediately, Duryeas were purchased by luminaries of the time, including George Vanderbilt. Two months after buying one of the first, manufactured cars - New York City motorist Henry Wells hit a bicyclist with his new Duryea; the rider suffered a broken leg, Wells spent a night in jail, and the United States' first traffic accident was recorded.
Outside of the Stacy Building - in what is now (as then) Springfield's Club Quarter - next to what is currently the popular Alumni Club at 90 Worthington Street, there is a model of an 1893 Duryea Motor Wagon - mere feet from the Stacy Building, where the Duryea Brothers invented and manufactured their history-changing machine.

Functional discourse grammar

Functional grammar (FG) and functional discourse grammar (FDG) are grammar models and theories motivated by functional theories of grammar. These theories explain how linguistic utterances are shaped, based on the goals and knowledge of natural language users. In doing so, it contrasts with Chomskyan transformational grammar. Functional discourse grammar has been developed as a successor to functional grammar, attempting to be more psychologically and pragmatically adequate than functional grammar.
The top-level unit of analysis in functional discourse grammar is the discourse move, not the sentence or the clause. This is a principle that sets functional discourse grammar apart from many other linguistic theories, including its predecessor functional grammar.
History.
Functional grammar (FG) is a model of grammar motivated by functions. The model was originally developed by Simon C. Dik at the University of Amsterdam in the 1970s, and has undergone several revisions since then. The latest standard version under the original name is laid out in the 1997 edition, published shortly after Dik's death. The latest version features the expansion of the model with a pragmatic/interpersonal module by Kees Hengeveld and Lachlan Mackenzie. This has led to a renaming of the theory to functional discourse grammar. This type of grammar is quite distinct from systemic functional grammar as developed by Michael Halliday and many other linguists since the 1970s.
The notion of "function" in FG generalizes the standard distinction of grammatical functions such as subject and object. Constituents (parts of speech) of a linguistic utterance are assigned three types or levels of functions:
Principles of functional discourse grammar.
There are a number of principles that guide the analysis of natural language utterances according to functional discourse grammar.
Functional discourse grammar explains the phonology, morphosyntax, pragmatics and semantics in one linguistic theory. According to functional discourse grammar, linguistic utterances are built top-down in this order by deciding upon:
According to functional discourse grammar, four components are involved in building up an utterance:
The grammatical component consists of four levels:
Example.
This example analyzes the utterance "I can't find the red pan. It is not in its usual place." according to functional discourse grammar at the interpersonal level.
At the interpersonal level, this utterance is one discourse move, which consists of two discourse acts, one corresponding to "I can't find the red pan." and another corresponding to "It is not in its usual place."
Similar analysis, decomposing the utterance into progressively smaller units, is possible at the other levels of the grammatical component.

Andover Village Industrial District

The Andover Village Industrial District encompasses one of the 19th century industrial mill villages of Andover, Massachusetts known locally as "The Village". The growth of this village contributed to the decision in the 19th century to separate the more rural area of North Andover from the town. It is centered on a stretch of the Shawsheen River between North Main Street on the east and Moraine Street on the west. Most of the district's properties lie on Stevens Street, Red Spring Road, Shawsheen Road, and Essex Street, with a few properties also located on adjacent roads.
Although no buildings remain from Andover's earliest industrial enterprises in the area, there are still some mill buildings that date as far back as to the 1820s in the old Marland Mill complex on Stevens Street. The most prominent building in this complex, however, is a spinning and carding mill that was built in 1885, and features a five story tower and ornate brick detailing.
The oldest building in the district is in the Abbot Mills complex, dating to 1814. Located at 18-20 Red Spring Road, it is a 1.5 story wood frame barn-like structure. It is next door to the mills of Smith & Dove, which are of stone construction dating to the 1820s. The other major industrial component of the district is the Tyer Rubber complex on Railroad Street, whose main building dates to 1912.
There is a significant variety in the types of housing related to the mills. Much of the early housing has Greek Revival styling, although there are a few houses that show more Federal style detailing. Later housing includes boarding houses, tenements, and other multiunit buildings in a diversity of styles.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

The Arlington Mills Company began operation (as the Arlington Woolen Mills) in 1865 at this location adjacent to the Spicket River, where there was an extant wooden mill building. This first building was destroyed by fire in 1866, and was replaced by another wooden structure in 1867. In 1880 this building was demolished and replaced by a new brick structure, which is one of the surviving buildings. The complex grew over the years, and was by 1925 one of the largest textile factories in the state. At the time of hits listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, the mill complex was owned by Malden Mills.

Arlington-Basswood Historic District

The Arlington-Basswood Historic District encompasses a substantial residential development project of the Arlington Mills Company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Roughly bounded by Lawrence, Alder, Arlington, and Juniper Streets, the district includes 89 properties, most of which are triple-deckers or other multiunit housing. The area was developed by the company between 1909 and 1925 to address local issues of overcrowding and poor sanitation. Most of the housing built features Classical Revival detailing, with bands of distinctive shingles, roof brackets, and dentil molding in roof cornices. Although some properties have lost some of their character due to modifications such as the application of synthetic siding, many have not. 
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Climate of Pakistan

Pakistan has recorded one of the highest temperatures in the world – – on 26 May, 2010. It is not only the hottest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan, but also the hottest reliably measured temperature ever recorded in the continent of Asia. As Pakistan is located on a great landmass north of the tropic of cancer (between latitudes 25° and 35° N), it has a continental type of climate characterized by extreme variations of temperature, both seasonally and daily. Very high altitudes modify the climate in the cold, snow-covered northern mountains; temperatures on the Balochistan Plateau are somewhat higher. Along the coastal strip, the climate is modified by sea breezes. In the rest of the country, temperatures reach great heights in the summer; the mean temperature during June is in the plains, the highest temperatures can exceed . In the summer, hot winds called Loo (wind) blow across the plains during the day. Trees shed their leaves to avoid loss of moisture. The dry, hot weather is broken occasionally by dust storms and thunderstorms that temporarily lower the temperature. Evenings are cool; the diurnal variation in temperature may be as much as to . Winters are cold, with minimum mean temperatures in Punjab of about in January, and sub-zero temperatures in the far north and Balochistan
The monsoon and the Western Disturbance are the two main factors which alter the weather over Pakistan; otherwise, Continental air prevails for rest of the year. Following are the main factors that influence the weather over Pakistan.
Pakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.
The climate in the capital city of Islamabad varies from an average daily low of 2°C in January to an average daily high of 38°C in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about 255 millimeters in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about fifty millimeters per month. Hailstorms are common in the spring.
Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, which is also the country's industrial center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets less rain. Only July and August average more than twenty-five millimeters of rain in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of 13°C during winter evenings to an average daily high of 34°C on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.
Extreme weather events.
Highest temperature and rainfall ever recorded.
The weather extremes in Pakistan include high and low temperatures, heaviest rainfall and flooding. The highest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan is which was recorded in Mohenjo-daro, Sindh on 26 May 2010. It was not only the hottest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan but also the hottest reliably measured temperature ever recorded on the continent of Asia. and the fourth highest temperature ever recorded on earth. The highest rainfall of was recorded in Islamabad during 24 hours on 24 July 2001. The record-breaking rain fell in just 10 hours. It was the heaviest rainfall in Islamabad in the previous 100 years.
Tropical cyclones and tornadoes.
Each year before the onset of monsoon that is 15 April to 15 July and also after its withdrawal that is 15 September to 15 December, there is always a distinct possibility of the cyclonic storm to develop in the north Arabian Sea. Cyclones form in the Arabian sea often results in strong winds and heavy rainfall in Pakistan's coastal areas. However tornadoes mostly occur during spring season that is March and April usually when a Western Disturbance starts effecting the northern parts of the country. It is also speculated that cycles of tornado years may be correlated to the periods of reduced tropical cyclone activity.
Drought.
The drought has become a frequent phenomenon in the country. Already, the massive droughts of 1998-2002 has stretched the coping abilities of the existing systems to the limit and it has barely been able to check the situation from becoming a catastrophe. The drought of 1998-2002 is considered worst in 50 years. According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan, the drought was one of the most significant factors responsible for the less than anticipated growth performance. The survey terms it as the worst drought in the history of the country. According to the government, 40 percent of the country's water needs went unmet.
Floods.
Pakistan has seen many floods, the most worst and destructive is the recent 2010 Pakistan floods, other floods which caused destruction in the history of Pakistan, includes the flood of 1950, which killed 2910 people, On 1 July 1977 heavy rains and flooding in Karachi, killed 248 people, according to Pakistan meteorological department of rain fell in 24 hours. In 1992 flooding during Monsoon season killed 1,834 people across the country, in 1993 flooding during Monsoon rains killed 3,084 people, in 2003 Sindh province was badly affected due to monsoon rains causing damages in billions, killed 178 people, while in 2007 Cyclone Yemyin submerged lower part of Balochistan Province in sea water killing 380 people. Before that it killed 213 people in Karachi on its way to Balochistan.
2010 Floods.
2010 July floods swept away the 20% of Pakistan's land, the flood is the result of unprecedented Monsoon rains which lasted from 28 July to 31 July 2010. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and North eastern Punjab were badly affected during the monsoon rains when dams, rivers and lakes overflowed. By mid-August, according to the governmental Federal Flood Commission (FFC), the floods had caused the deaths of at least 1,540 people, while 2,088 people had received injuries, 557,226 houses had been destroyed, and over 6 million people had been displaced. One month later, the data had been updated to reveal 1,781 deaths, 2,966 people with injuries, and more than 1.89 million homes destroyed. The flood affected more than 20 million people exceeding the combined total of individuals affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The flood is considered as worst in Pakistan's history affecting people of all four provinces and Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan.
2011 Sindh floods.
The 2011 Sindh floods began during the monsoon season in mid-August 2011, resulting from heavy monsoon rains in Sindh, Eastern Balochistan, and Southern Punjab. The floods have caused considerable damage; an estimated 270 civilians have been killed, with 5.3 millio­n people and 1.2 millio­n homes affect­ed. Sindh is a fertile region and often called the "breadbasket" of the country; the damage and toll of the floods on the local agrarian economy is said to be extensive. At least 1.7 million acres of arable land has been inundated as a result of the flooding. The flooding has been described as the worst since the 2010 Pakistan floods, which devastated the entire country. Unprecedented torrential monsoon rains caused severe flooding in 16 districts of Sindh province.

Bakers Island Light

Bakers Island Light is a historic lighthouse on Bakers Island in Salem, Massachusetts. 
The station was originally established in 1791, with a daymark. This was replaced in 1798 by two lights atop a keeper's house, one at each end. After storm damage in 1815, an octagonal stone tower was constructed. The current round stone tower was added in 1820. The 1820 tower was taller, leading to the names "Ma" and "Pa". The two remained in service until 1926, when the older, shorter tower was removed.
The light was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Baker's Island Light Station in 1976.
Nomenclature.
The City of Salem, the Coast Guard, and NOAA spell the name without an apostrophe, but the National Register of Historic Places includes it. The name is always written with the "s".

Transition to and from Hostilities

Transition to and from Hostilities is a 2004 report by the Defense Science Board, a committee of civilian experts appointed to advise the U.S. Department of Defense on scientific and technical matters. The report was the foundation for a subsequent Department of Defense Instruction that elevated Operations Other Than War (OOTW) to co-equal status with combat operations.
Overview.
The report made two key recommendations. First, that the management discipline demonstrated by United States Armed Forces in combat operations should be extended to peacetime work, post-conflict stabilization and intelligence in pre- and post-conflict phases of defense activities. Second, that additional capacity was required within United States Department of Defense in order to deliver the stabilization, reconstruction and intelligence tasks required in pre- or post-stabilization phases of Defense operations.

Arab Chileans

Arab Chileans, are immigrants to Chile from the Arab world. Most are Christian and are the descendants of economic migrants from Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, who arrived in Chile in the mid-19th to early-20th centuries.
Ethnically Arab Chileans are often called "Turks", (Spanish: Turcos) a term believed to derive from the fact that they arrived from the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Most arrived as members of the Eastern Orthodox church, but a minority became Roman Catholic. A minority are Muslim.
It is estimated that 800,000 Chileans or nearly 5% of the population is of Arab origin, chiefly descendants of immigrants from the Middle East (i.e. Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese and Middle East Armenians).
Chile is home to a large population of immigrants, mostly Christian, from the Levant. Roughly 500,000 Palestinian descendants are believed to reside in Chile. And the effects of their migration are widely visible. The earliest such migrants came in the 1850s, with others arriving during World War I and later the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The "Club Palestino" is one of the most prestigious social clubs in Santiago. They are believed to form the largest Palestinian community outside of the Arab world. Aside from these migrants of previous decades, Chile has also taken in some Palestinian refugees in later years, as in April 2008 when they received 117 from the Al-Waleed refugee camp on the Syria–Iraq border near the Al-Tanf crossing. The situation in Gaza has caused tensions even thousands of miles away between the Israeli and Palestinian communities in Chile.
Historically, the Arabs of Chile were called Turks, Moors, Arabs or Lebanese. In recent years they have often called themselves Palestinians. In the past decade, most of the Arab immigration are Iraqis.
The Christian Orthodox, built the "Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Santiago and All Chile" in Santiago in 1917. It is a cathedral of the Church of Antioch with six parishes.
History.
The first Arabs in Chile first registered in a census carried out dates back to 1895, however, in 1854 and 1885 are some subjects of the Ottoman Empire, which could well be in Lebanon, Palestine or Syria, which were part of the Empire at the time.
The majority of Palestinians arrived in the early 20th century, fleeing the Ottoman Empire due primarily to professing the Christian religion, oppressive rule and then the economic situation and the outbreak of the First World War. Note that the Ottoman Turkish oppression (Sunnis) was reflected not only in the Christian minority in Syria, Palestine and Lebanon, but against Shiite Muslims who arrived in the entire Atlantic coast to be the majority in the region, and some spent via Argentina to Chile in the early 20th century located across the country bringing to their culture and work to the development of Chile.
On arrival, the Arabs were devoted to work primarily in the commercial sector. The Palestinian community, despite their cultural differences with Chilean society, managed to permeate and an important part of the country's middle class, although some of its members have some of the greatest wealth of the country. Although the District Board, in Santiago and the city of La Calera were his main residence centers, meeting and trade for many years, in recent times have moved over the city of Santiago de Chile, Las Condes, Providence, Ñuñoa and Recoleta.
The large influx Arab party began in 1860 and extends until 1900. It is estimated that the Arabs who came to America reached at one million people. Until 1918 the Palestinians migrated with Turkish passports. The output ports were Beirut, Haifa and Alexandria, and the journey was made via Genoa and Marseille.
The large concentrations of immigrants were Syrians, Palestinians, Lebanese and their descendants in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. It is estimated that Latin America would amount to 25 million of Arab descent.
By 1940, the Arab Guide de Chile estimated at 13,466 the number of Arabs in Chile.
61% of the Arabs arrived in our country did between 1900 and 1930. Over 60% of Arabs who came were between 10 and 30 years old .
In 1912 appears the "Muerched", the first Chilean newspaper written in Arabic. It is estimated that there were at least 12 publications such during the 40 years of immigration.
In addition to the strong influence and varied diversity in areas of national affairs, a fact which demonstrates the presence of the Arab population in Chile, is the call for at least 7 players who were Chilean-born Palestinians (as Roberto Bishara) in the Palestinian football team during the Asian qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup 2006.
Economic influence in Chile.
It is the case of the Banna family: Yarur, Carlos, Jorge and Amador. His father, John, emigrated in 1894 from Bethlehem and was a good move. He died in 1954, when Cotton Manufacturers under Yarur lived its golden age: the company, founded in 1936 with his brothers Nicholas and Saba, it produced 60% of cotton yarn and fabrics in Chile. Its partners were the Said-Isa and his six children, among them Salvador, the father of Joseph, now a member of the Parque Arauco shopping mall-amusement park and BHIF.
In the years since, Yarur developed Chilean Cotton Manufactures. And when they bought the company, Said decided to leave his side to the new owners.
At his death, the patriarch Yarur presided over the Banco de Crédito e Inversiones (BCI), which was released in 1937 and has the distinction of being the only one in Chile that is still owned by its founders. Since 1991 is chaired by Luis Enrique Yarur, son of Charles.
Today is the fourth financial institution, with 11% of loans and returns on equity of 24%, and among the 20 largest banks in the region. In 2003 the Bank acquired Conosur at about U.S. $ 100 million.
Furthermore, Yarur own over 50% of Viña Morandé.
José Said Saffie (age 72) multiplied the family fortune and is among the most affluent persons in Chile and Latin America, as owner of 21% of Parque Arauco, 16% BHIF Bank-BBVA, which concentrates 7% of loans, 25% of Andina Bottling, 30% of Factorline, factoring the fourth largest in the country, 48% of Edelpa, the largest flexible packaging and 50% of Clínica Reñaca.
In the area of the mall has invested in Argentina, where Parque Arauco owns 27% of Alto Palermo, a company that manages eight shopping centers, including Patio Bullrich and unique Market Hall.
Apart from the groups spearheading the cousins José Said Saffie, Jaime Said Demaria and his uncle, Domingo Said Kattan, there is another branch that descends from the businessman born in Bethlehem Issa Said Sahuire: that of Antonio Said Kattan, brother of Domingo. This is the only one still remains in the textile sector. At 92 years, heads Fibratex Textiles Manufacturing. It also has real estate investment and action by the Electronic Stock Exchange.
A group met in 1986 under the name of the Ten Mosques, whose history dates back to 1986. Then Carlos Abumohor called Espir Aguad, Alejandro Kauak, Munir Khamis, Selum Jorge Fernando Abuhadba and pairs of Odde Rishmague with Solomon and Domingo Díaz and Álvaro Saieh with Juan Rafael Gutiérrez (the only non-Arab) to form a bank, conscious that the textile industry was in decline.
The economic boom enjoyed by Chilean society was formed by Arab Investment, a financial firm where the individual contribution was U.S. $ 1 million. Saieh took over as manager.
Two years later, he merged the Bank of Labor, making it the third of the square. In the early 1990s formed subgroups to start new businesses. First was the purchase of AFP Provida, in 1993 - six years later sold to BBVA for U.S. $ 260 billion, where through participating INECSA Saieh only, the Diaz family, Fernando Aguad the Abumohor and Rishmague Odde.
This operation was later joined Interbanc purchases of Peru and insurance companies Mass and compensates. In 1995 was born on holding Inversiones Financieras SA (Infisa), where Saieh kept 51% of the property.
That year the Bank purchased Infisa Sonami Conception to U.S. $ 60 million to merge with Osorno. But they accepted the offer of Banco Santander: nearly $ 500 million by the Osorno. At that time Juan Gutiérrez left the group. Khamis and later emigrated Kauak.
Consolidated acquired in Venezuela and in Argentina the Buci, who later disposed of. Here AFP acquired the Union and Financial Protection and Condell. In 1997, seeking to give a new image and profile, the Concepción was renamed Infisa Corpbanca and became the holding Corpgroup.
Saieh, Abumohor, Rishmague Díaz Cumsille, Selum and remain in Corpgroup Aguad. The bag placed in holding 24.9% of Corpbanca in November 2002 and exactly one year later topped the 23% that belonged to foreign funds Blackstone Group, JP Morgan Partners and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, in addition to ADR Wall Street, to provide more liquidity to the action. This institution is the fifth of the financial system in loans, with 3.8%.
But everyone has done their part. Rishmague in 2002 consolidated his emerging regional financial holding company UCB, UCB umbrella of Financial Services, Factoring UCB, Union Credit Bank in Miami, and a significant share of Chile Corpbanca, Corpbanca Venezuela. Its assets exceed $ 100 million.
Also betting on the U.S. market, and its partners Saieh Álvaro Jorge Selum, Fernando and Alberto Aguad Muchnick - through Corpgroup Financial Services, concluded an agreement in November 2002 to buy First Western Bank of Florida, allegedly close in December. The aim is to use that entity - with assets of U.S. $ 30 million as a platform for Latin America and complement Corpgroup operations, where 51% Saieh handles.
He also leads Real Estate Andrés Bello, owner of the buildings of the university of the same name and Indisa Clinic. It is the driver of Journalism Consortium (COPES), which publishes the daily La Tercera, The Fourth, The Hours, Revista Que Pasa and Paula. There are the Abumohor family (or nicknamed "el Trek" for the migration of Palestinians they represented have entered the Chilean economy).
Cumsille Juan Pablo Diaz, president of the prestigious social group, "Club Palestino" (the Palestinian Club) in Santiago was processing a license to open in 2004 the Banco Progreso. This is a civil engineer and heir of Solomon Domingo Diaz Cautín involved in Real Estate, which leases properties in the center, and Lo Espejo Comercial who sells machinery for construction. But its strength is the leasing and factoring, through Progress Financial Services.
The Abumohor, Álvaro Saieh, Juan Pablo Diaz, Domingo Diaz, Alejandro and Juan Rafael Gutiérrez Kauak formed Cabildo SA in 1997 purchased the Hacienda Rupanco at about U.S. $ 80 million. The site, about 50 000 hectares, has 30 thousand head of cattle and is one of the leading producers of milk.
The grandfather of the early "el Trek Abumohor" century, but it was Zechariah - Nicholas's father, Carlos and René, who entered the textile business distributing imported clothing.
After a spinning industry, leased, bought and expanded the business to be grouped under the parent American Manufacturing (Maisa).
They are on the peninsula resorts Pucón, Puerto Velero, the Haras de Pirque and Club Balthus. In the real estate and commercial control 10% of Parque Arauco and textiles, Maisa Spinning Mills (licensee of Benetton, Esprit, Nino Mori, Arrow and New Man) Carpet and Wiener.
Munir Khamis, after selling its stake in Corpbanca embarked on the textiles. There is a partner with his cousins in Bromac SA, dedicated to the embroidered linens, children's clothing and home affairs. It also has 25% of Trama, an importer of fabrics for the clothing created in 1985.
An architect by profession, has concentrated on building projects, in Santiago and the Tenth Region, through Pacific Real Estate and Building America.
Kauak owns 10% of the tax Rupanco and livestock is a major employer. With its four fields in the X region it is an agricultural corporation and their dairy division produces about six million liters of milk a year.
This year will begin construction of a shopping center next to the group in Osorno Cordel and plans to return to the financial world, with a bank for SMEs.
Kassis Cecinas owns San Jorge and in 2002 bought Cecinas JK to his brother John, which controls about 30% of the domestic market of sausages. Participate in building projects in Peñalolén associated with Sarquis and Marcelo Zalaquett, and Las Condes.
Dr. George Manzur is nicknamed the "First Palestinian of Chile" or personality leader to represented the power and prominence of the Palestinian community, as he's involved in medical science, financial business and national politics.

Salem Willows Historic District

The Salem Willows Historic District of eastern Salem, Massachusetts encompasses a now residential area that had its origins as a 19th-century summer resort community. Development of the area began in 1875, after Daniel Gardner purchased land at Juniper Point he had been leasing with the intent of developing it. There is evidence from an 1874 map that he may have begun development as early as 1874, even though he did not have permission to erect permanent structures on the land then. This development grew, and a significant number of modest cottage-style houses were built between then and the early 20th century. Alongside this development, the Salem Willows Park, just to its north, began to take shape, with a casino located at Bay View and Fort Avenues, and a large pavilion at Fort and Island Avenues, visible on an 1897 map. The area became popular with day visitors, and hotels catering to tourists were built, although only one, the Central House at 1 High Street, has survived. The park is owned by the city, and continues to be used as a recreational area.

No. 662 Squadron RAF

No. 662 Squadron was a Royal Air Force Air Observation Post squadron associated with the 21st Army Group and later part of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Numbers 651 to 663 Squadrons of the RAF were Air Observation Post units working closely with Army units in artillery spotting and liaison. A further three of these squadrons, 664–666, were manned with Canadian personnel. Their duties and squadron numbers were transferred to the Army with the formation of the Army Air Corps on 1 September 1957. 
History.
Formation and early years.
No. 662 Squadron was formed at RAF Old Sarum on 30 September 1943 with the Auster III which gave way to the Auster IV in March 1944. The squadron role was to support the British 21st Army Group in June 1944 when it moved to France. The squadron supported the Army until the end of the war when it was disbanded on 15 December 1945 at Melsbroek in Belgium.
Post war.
After the war the Air Observation Squadrons were reformed and No. 662 Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force was reformed as such at RAF Colerne on 1 May 1949, also operating a flight from RAF Middle Wallop, to provide support to the Army in the West Country until it was disbanded at RAF Colerne on 10 March 1957.

Americans and Canadians in Chile

American Chileans and Canadian Chileans are Chileans of North American ancestry (Americans and Canadians). Over 300,000 Chileans have North American ancestors, with 100,000 said to be of Cherokee Indian descent. 19th century settlement and land speculation deals brought tens of thousands of U.S. Americans to Chile with the rest of Central and South America.
History.
Immigration.
Along with the British, U.S. citizens came to Chile to develop the country's economy and trade from the early 19th century onwards. Even though very few compared to the British, they did contribute to Chile's wealth and economic development well into the 20th century. Other Anglosphere immigrants included Irish, New Zealanders and Australians.
Valparaíso was on the route from Britain to California, which the US won from Mexico in 1845. That same port was even the scene of one of the battles of the Anglo-American War of 1812. One American who was in Chile was Wheelwright, who introduced the railway in Chile and nearby Argentina in the 1850s. In the California Gold Rush, a massive influx of Chilean miners went to California and many had returned to Chile wealthier than before.
To Chileans, Americans, almost all of British ancestry at the time, were so similar to the British that they were both lumped together as "gringos", a term still used for Americans. Nowadays, most Chileans are much familiar with U.S. American culture than British culture, due to Hollywood and popular music.
It was not only European Americans who emigrated to Chile. In the 18th and 19th centuries, a group of Cherokee Indians settled in Chile and finally integrated into the Spanish Chilean majority, making themselves invisible. Joaquin Murieta, a legendary figure was considered a Chilean of Cherokee descent. He was part of a migration of Cherokee and other American Indian settlers from the Southeastern United States and Indian Territory in the late 19th century into Chile and other South American countries like Brazil.
Contributions.
"Americo-Chilean"s played a role in international diplomacy between the two countries (see United States-Chile relations). The relationship turned tense during the Salvador Allende era (1970–73), in which the U.S. CIA-backed coup replaced him with general Augusto Pinochet to head a right-wing military regime (1973–89).
Also the American Chilean community were instrumental in reformation of the economy of Chile since the Chicago Boys experiment in U.S. business schools from the late 1950s to early 1990s known as "El Milagro Economico" (economic miracle) or Miracle of Chile.
Historically, some Chilean immigrants to the U.S. (see Chilean American) originated from the Central Valley of Chile from the San Antonio, Chile and Los Angeles, Chile areas, usually to California during the gold rush era (1846–54). Many Chileans prospered there and some were established enough to return home with their new wealth.
In August 18, 1906; a major earthquake struck Valparaíso with great devastation and thousands of deaths. Chilean doctor Carlos Van Buren, of U.S. American descent, was involved in medical care of earthquake victims. He later established a modern hospital Carlos Van Buren Hospital in 1912. American and European medical staffers improved medical care in Chile, where it has a universal health system since 1925.
Military experts from the U.S. and Great Britain when the British Empire peaked in the turn of the 20th century, and pre-1914 Prussia (now Germany) developed and modernized the Chilean armed forces (the army, national police, navy and air force).
Demography.
Today, (North) American culture is a dominant force in Chilean society, and an increase of North American tourists from the US and Canada in the 1990s and 2000s attracted to the world-renowned scenery and increasing economic opportunity in Chile.

The Woodberry-Quarrels House is a historic First Period house at 180 Bridge Street in Hamilton, Massachusetts. The oldest part of this 2.5 story, seven bay wood frame house is the central doorway and the rooms to its right, which were built c. 1690 along with a central chimney that was probably removed during Federal-period alterations. Later in the First Period rooms to the left of the entry were added, and there have been a series of alterations and additions since then. The First Period core of the house survived the major Federal-era changes, and the house retains much decorative work from that period.

Robert Stone (cricketer)

Robert Stone (29 January 1749 – June 1820) was an English first-class cricketer with amateur status. He was born in Brixton and was initially associated with Surrey but he went on to represent other teams. The full span of his career is uncertain but he was definitely active between 1773 and 1780, playing in eight first-class matches. According to "CricketArchive", Stone resurrected his career with two further matches in the 1790 season, but it cannot be said with certainty that this was the same man, especially as he seems to have moved from Surrey to Kent.

<doc id="18733617" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18733617" title="Multiwinia">
Multiwinia

Multiwinia is the fourth video game made by Introversion Software, the creators of "Uplink", "Darwinia" and "Defcon". It is a real-time strategy game. "Multiwinia" is available as a standalone game, or included as part of "Darwinia+".
Plot.
Multiwinia follows its predecessor "Darwinia", in which a computer scientist, Dr Sepulveda, created a digital world that existed within a computer network. This world, Darwinia, was inhabited by a two-dimensional digital life-form called Darwinians and was to become "the world's first digital theme park". In "Darwinia", the player eradicated a computer virus that infected the world and threatened the life of the Darwinians. After this, Dr Sepulveda deemed the world safe again. However, the virus had changed something in the Darwinians, and over time they became more aggressive, dividing into factions and fighting. Now labelled Multiwinians, the tribes continue to fight each other.
Gameplay.
"Multiwinia" is a real-time strategy game with six different modes. Each mode is designed to support between one and four players (human or CPU) and up to 50 unique maps of varying difficulties.
Each team fights to control the entire map.
Teams fight over the spawn points dotted around the map in order to capture them and achieve a dominant position that will enable them to control the entire map. This game mode will continue until one team is victorious, or a timer can be used to limit the game to a set time limit. After that time the team with the most spawn points will win the game.
On each map there are a fixed number of Scoring zones - for a standard sized two-player map there are up to four zones. Each team can score points by occupying these zones with Multiwinians - scoring one point per second for every zone under their control. 
Scoring zones often become areas of heavy fighting, and are frequently occupied by several teams at once, all in intense combat. In this case, the team with the largest share of the zone will be scoring the points, and this is shown by rendering the Scoring zone as a "pie chart", showing the team colours occupying the zone and their relative percentages.
Multiwinians must lift the giant stone statues that appear in the Statue Zone, and carry them safely back to their base to score points.
Large numbers of Multiwinians are required to lift the heavy statues, and they move very slowly. If the Multiwinians carrying a statue are killed, it is dropped and remains where it is until more Multiwinians pick it up. If it is dropped heavily (e.g. on the edge of a steep hill) the statue shatters, and re-appears randomly in one of the Statue Zones.
Each team has a base near their start point, into which they must lift the statue to score a point. The winner is the team that has successfully carried the most number of statues to their base.
Each team has a giant rocket at their start point, and in order to win they must refuel and occupy the rocket, and perform a successful launch.
Each team must complete several stages in order to successfully launch their rocket. First it must be refueled, and then occupied by 100 Multiwinian astronauts. Once occupied a launch countdown begins and upon completion the rocket launches. The team that first launches its rocket wins the game.
Fuel for the rocket is generated by several fuel pumps, located around the map. These fuel pumps are the key to winning Rocket Riot - the team must occupy and control the solar panels which work the fuel pumps, in order to divert their fuel into the rocket.
At any point during these phases, the rocket is extremely vulnerable to explosions. If the rocket is successfully attacked by an enemy team it will explode, burning all the fuel and all the Multiwinians inside, and resetting the rocket to its starting point.
Each team tries to capture the enemy's flag while defending their own.
Each team starts with a flag. A number of other flags are spread across the map, and in order to win the game, a team must capture flags which link their own flag to their opponents' flags. When a team loses its flag, it is eliminated from the game - the last team standing (the one which has kept hold of its flag until the end of the game) wins. Each team's flag is well protected, and each team receives regular reinforcements of Multiwinians throughout the match.
One team must defend a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) that will explode within a defined time period, whilst the other team must attack and destroy the WMD before the time period elapse. Play then switches around and the attacker becomes the defender and vice versa. The winner is the team that successfully attacks in the quickest time.
The attacking team receives a constant flow of reinforcements whilst the defending team is heavily armed with turrets, but has a limited force. The attacking team must build up a force and attack in waves to capture machine gun turrets, pillboxes and sabotage the three control stations connected to the bomb. The constant reinforcements provided to the attacking team ensure that eventually they will break through - the challenge is for the defending team to hold off for as long as possible.
Reception.
Eurogamer rated "Multiwinia" 8/10, calling it "a quirky but devilishly compelling distillation of all that strategy games can be". IGN rated it 7.6/10, citing the crate power ups as the game's "most questionable element" and stating "while it's still undoubtedly fun as a lightweight experience, it's far from being cerebrally rewarding or especially clever." Strategy Informer rated "Multiwinia" 8.7/10, calling it "A true triumph".

Shoreborne Wilson House

The Shoreborne Wilson House is a historic colonial house at 4 South Main Street in Ipswich, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built between 1685 and 1692 by Shoreborne Wilson, a cooper. It has a basic four-room center chimney plan, of which Wilson built the northwest section. The house was acquired by Captain Samuel Appleton in 1702, who likely built the southeast section. In the following years the house went through a variety of uses. It underwent a restoration of sorts in the 1920s, in which fireplaces and trim details were replaced.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

.450 Marlin

The .450 Marlin is a firearms cartridge designed as a modernized equivalent to the venerable .45-70 lever-action cartridge. It was designed by a joint team of Marlin and Hornady engineers headed by Hornady's Mitch Mittelstaedt, and was released in 2000, with cartridges manufactured by Hornady and rifles manufactured by Marlin, mainly the Model 1895M levergun. The Browning BLR is also now available in .450 Marlin chambering. Marlin ceased manufacture of the 1895M rifle in 2009. It is not known if or when this model will be available again.
Design.
While ballistically similar to the .45-70, the .450 Marlin was not developed from the .45-70. Rather, the .450 Marlin was developed from the wildcat .458×2" American, which was based on the .458 Winchester Magnum. This places the .450 Marlin in the .458 Winchester family of cartridges, though it is more easily understood as a "modernized" .45-70. 
The belt has been modified to prevent it from chambering in smaller-bore 7mm Magnum or .338 Magnum rifles. The .45-70 and .450 Marlin cannot be cross-chambered, but rifles chambered for the .458x2 can be modified to fire the .450 Marlin.
Visually, the case resembles that of the .458 Winchester Magnum with a wider belt. The cartridge is most useful for hunting big game at short ranges, being accurate at ranges of .

Jim Webb (rugby)

Alfred "Jim" Webb (1878–29 July 1955) was a Welsh international rugby union player who played club rugby for Abertillery and county rugby for Monmouthshire. He won 20 caps for Wales and was part of the 1910 touring British Isles team to South Africa.
Webb was a strong forward player who was part of three Triple Crown Wales teams, and won 19 consecutive caps, all while playing for a 'second class' team, normally unpopular with selectors. On 22 December 1908, Webb while captain of Abertillery, lead his team against the first touring Australian team. The resulting 3-3 draw is one of the greatest days in the club's history.
Webb is remembered as a powerful scrummager, strong at line-outs and mauls. He was a modest, proud and defiantly loyal man.
International career.
After a strong performance against the touring South Africans with county team Monmouthshire, Webb was capped for Wales against Scotland on February, 1907. He would play for Wales a further 19 times. His final game was against Scotland in 1912 in which he led the pack in a rousing victory. The selectors though felt Webb was too old and too slow and he was dropped. Webb would later argue with the Welsh Rugby Union selectors and leave the game of rugby union. He joined St. Helens but would only play five matches for the team.

Brühl (Leipzig)

The is a street in Leipzig, Germany, just within the former city wall.
History.
On the corner of the Brühl and Katharinestrasse stands the Romanus house, built for the mayor of Leipzig between 1701 and 1704, and one of the finest baroque buildings remaining in the town.
In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the Brühl was part of the Jewish quarter of the city. 
The Brühl retained Jewish connections into the 20th century. The street was the centre of the World fur trade. Chaim Eitingon, the Russian-born 'king of the fur trade', opened a branch there in 1893, and in the 1920s the street represented one-third of the world trade in furs. Only 4.2% of Leipzigers as a whole worked in the fur industry, but 8.7% of Jewish Leipzigers did. The Brühl was an emblem of Jewish economic activity in Leipzig, and of the city as a whole
In 1938, under the Nazi government, 'the entire Brühl district changed hands, as fur firms — the pinnacle of Jewish commerce in the city, along with the department stores — were stolen from their owners.
Today the street contains a few 19th-century and early 20th-century buildings, most of the remaining buildings being from the third quarter of the 20th century. A notable modern building is the town's "Museum der bildenden Künste" (Museum of the visual arts).
Wagner's birthplace.
It was in the Brühl, in 1813, that the composer Richard Wagner was born at no. 3, the 'House of the Red and White Lions'. Ironically, Wagner's disciple Theodor Uhlig, in an 1850 essay which Wagner was later to build on for his own essay "Das Judenthum in der Musik", condemned the music of Meyerbeer by linking it to the Jewish quarters of Leipzig and Dresden: 'If that is dramatic song, then Gluck, Mozart, Cherubini and Spontini carried out their studies at the Neumarkt in Dresden or the Brühl in Leipzig.' Wagner's birthplace was demolished in 1886, three years after his death, and the site is now occupied by a disused (as of August 2008) department store, built in 1968 to a design of the architect Harry Müller. It is hoped to replace this building over the next few years with a new construction that could incorporate parts of the foundations of the Wagner house and will contain a memorial to the composer.
A parallel street to the Brühl is now named "Richard-Wagner-Straße".

Ashutosh Tewari

Ashutosh K. Tewari (born in Kanpur, India) is Chairman of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. He is a board certified American urologist, oncologist, and principal investigator. Before moving to the Icahn School of Medicine in 2013, he was the founding director of both the Center for Prostate Cancer at Weill Cornell Medical College and the LeFrak Center for Robotic Surgery at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. Dr. Tewari was the Ronald P. Lynch endowed Chair of Urologic Oncology and the hospital's Director of Robotic Prostatectomy, treating patients with prostate, urinary bladder and other urological cancers. He is one of world's leading urological surgeons, and has performed over 5500 robotically assisted procedures using the da Vinci Surgical System. Academically, he is recognized as a world renowned expert on urologic oncology with over 250 peer reviewed published papers to his credit; he is on such lists as America's Top Doctors, New York Magazine's Best Doctors, and Who's Who in the World. In 2012, he was given the American Urological Association Gold Cystoscope Award for "outstanding contributions to the field of urologic oncology, most notably the treatment of prostate cancer and the development of novel techniques to improve the outcomes of robotic prostatectomy." 
Robotic prostatectomy.
With the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System, the advent of robotic surgery using a laparoscopic approach has significantly changed the way prostate cancer surgery and prostatectomy procedures in general are performed as compared to the traditional 'open' methodology. Much of Tewari's research projects serve to promote robotic surgery as opposed to open procedures. For example, Tewari has shown that the operating field has become more visible to the surgeon, unobscured by the copious amounts of blood encountered in traditional surgery and is thus able to view the urological structures under three-dimensional, enlarged magnification. Patients reap even greater benefits. Due to the minimally invasive nature of the procedure, they experience minimized pain, minimized blood loss, less scarring and fewer complications. Post-surgery recovery is accelerated and patients experience quicker return to urinary continence and sexual function. Some of Tewari's current research is focused on comparing the benefits of robot-assisted surgery with traditional open prostatic surgery.
Career.
On October 15, 2013, Dr. Tewari was named the Chairman of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Previously he served as Director of the Lefrak Institute of Robotic Surgery, Director of Prostate cancer, as well as the Director of Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer-Urologic Oncology Outcomes at the Brady Urology Foundation of Weill Medical College. He is a tenured Professor of Urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. In addition, Tewari directs a fellowship program in Robotic Prostatectomy and Prostate Cancer Outcomes that has conducted research comparing robotic surgery outcomes versus those of laparoscopic and open surgeries. Tewari is an Attending physician at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.
Education.
Receiving his medical education from Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College (GSVM) in Uttar Pradesh, India, Tewari graduated with honors in 1984 with 17 gold academic medals to credit. He received his training in urology from Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) in India under the mentorship of Professor Mahendra Bhandari and completed the McH and DNB program in 1991.
Training.
Tewari has trained in the U.S. at UCSF, University of Florida and at HFHS under Dr. Mani Menon, where was part of the surgical team that performed the first robotic procedure at VUI. Tewari completed his urology residency at the Vattikuti Urology Institute (VUI) of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan in 2004. He received his urologic oncology research training at the University of California, San Francisco in 1994, the University of Florida in 1998, and VUI in 2004.
Research.
Tewari's research interests revolve around the diagnosis and treatment of patients with urological cancers, with a focus on prostate cancer. His research ranges from the study of patient outcomes, robotic techniques, molecular markers for cancer aggressiveness, racial disparity in cancer biology, quality of life studies, strategies to improve nerve sparing and sexual function recovery, and anatomic studies to facilitate continence preservation to the development of next generation robotic techniques. He has received several federal and non-federal research funding grants for his research on prostate cancer, totaling several million dollars in grant capital. He is one of the few urologists in the world to receive an NIH R01 Grant. Additionally, he is among the first surgeons to use real time tissue imaging during surgery to minimize nerve damage in the patient and was the first surgeon in the world to use the catheter-less Prostate Surgery. The catheter-less surgery minimizes postoperative pain after prostatectomy.
Honors, awards, and prizes.
A few of the medical conference and achievement awards earned by Tewari and his research team are:
Professional activities.
Tewari serves as a reviewer for a number of prestigious professional journals including the Journal of Urology, British Journal of Urology, Contemporary Urology, Medscape, Post Graduate Medicine, and Oncology Operational. He is the associate editor for BJU International. Tewari has served as a visiting professor and lecturer at dozens of venues both in the United States and abroad.

Collis Primary School

Collis Primary School is a large state primary school located in Teddington, Middlesex, United Kingdom. Following an extensive building project in 2005/6, the school has increased from two-form to three-form entry. The school achieved the highest rating possible in its most recent Ofsted report, with "Outstanding" given in every category.
History.
Collis School (then Park Road Girl's School) was founded in 1865 by Sarah Collis in a house in Park Road, Teddington. Initially, there were just 16 pupils, but this had risen to 71 by the end of the year. Boys were first admitted in 1871 and by 1875, there were 318 pupils attending. 
Following the Education Act of 1891 and the introduction of free schooling, the school moved in 1902 to Station Road and was renamed accordingly. Sarah Collis retired in 1906 and the school was taken over by her niece, Mary Collis. The school was again renamed in 1937 to Christchurch County Primary School, before being finally called Collis School in 1960.
The school moved to its present location on Fairfax Road in 1972 and the school as it is today was completed in 1982 with a new nursery department. The now headmaster, David Butterfield took over in 1991. In 2005/6 a new building was built to catch up with growing demand for places at the school in the local area. The school now accepts three classes per year instead of two,even with 4 in the infants.
Facilities.
Collis is situated on a very very large field which can be used, weather-permitting, by pupils at breaktimes. It is also used for P.E. and football practices. The grounds also contain a concrete playing area for the winter including two netball pitches, an adventure playground, an even bigger play-frame,a nature trail and a small swimming pool. The school also possesses an ICT suite.

United States House of Representatives elections in New Mexico, 2008

The 2008 congressional elections in New Mexico were held on November 4, 2008 to determine New Mexico's representation in the United States House of Representatives. The party primary elections were held June 3, 2008. Martin Heinrich, Harry Teague, and Ben R. Luján, all Democrats, were elected to represent New Mexico in the House. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; the winners of the election currently serve in the 111th Congress, which began on January 4, 2009 and is scheduled to end on January 3, 2011. The election coincided with the 2008 U.S. presidential election and senatorial elections. 
New Mexico has three seats in the House, apportioned according to the 2000 United States Census. Its 2007-2008 congressional delegation consisted of two Republicans and one Democrat. All three incumbents chose to vie for New Mexico's open Senate seat. The election resulted in all three New Mexico seats are being occupied by freshman Democrats. Districts 1 and 2 changed from Republican to Democratic; "CQ Politics" had forecast that these seats might be at risk for the Republican Party.
District 1.
This district includes the central area of New Mexico, in and around Albuquerque. An open seat, CQ Politics forecast the race as 'No Clear Favorite'. "The Rothenberg Political Report" rated it 'Pure Toss-Up'. "The Cook Political Report" ranked it 'Lean Democratic'.
The 2006 race between incumbent Republican Heather Wilson and Democratic state Attorney General Patricia Madrid was a cliffhanger, with Wilson being reelected by 861 votes. John Kerry narrowly won the district with 52% in 2004 (CPVI=D+2). With the retirement of longtime U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, Wilson ran and lost as a candidate for the Republican nomination in the race for an open U.S. Senate seat, leaving this an open seat. The Democratic nominee was Martin Heinrich (former Albuquerque City Councilor). The Republican nominee was Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White.
In the general election, Heinrich defeated White by a margin of 11%. When sworn into Congress in January 2009, Heinrich became the first Democrat to ever represent this district in the House.
District 2.
This district covers the southern half of the state of New Mexico, including Las Cruces and Roswell. "CQ Politics" forecast the race as 'Leans Republican'. "The Rothenberg Political Report" rated it 'Pure Toss-Up'. "The Cook Political Report" ranked it 'Republican Toss Up'.
Republican incumbent Steve Pearce won his party's nomination over Heather Wilson for the U.S. Senate, leaving this an open seat. This district usually votes Republican. George W. Bush won the district 58% to 42% over John Kerry in 2004 (CPVI=R+6). Nevertheless, Democratic nominee Harry Teague defeated Republican Edward R. Tinsely III in the general election and is the first Democrat to represent this district since 1981.
Candidates.
Teague is a Hobbs business owner, civic leader and former Lea County Commissioner.
Tinsley is a restaurateur.
District 3.
This district covers the northern half of the state of New Mexico, including the capital, Santa Fe. An open seat, "CQ Politics" forecast the race as 'Safe Democrat', as did "The Rothenberg Political Report" and "The Cook Political Report".
Democratic incumbent Tom Udall won his party's nomination for Pete Domenici's open U.S. Senate seat. The Democrats tend to hold the advantage in the district: John Kerry received 54% of the vote there (CPVI=D+6) in 2004. The Democratic nominee was State Public Regulation Commissioner Ben R. Luján. Luján's father serves as Speaker of the New Mexico House of Representatives. The Republican nominee was small business owner Dan East. Carol Miller, a 1997/1998 Green Party candidate, was seeking the seat as an independent.
Luján won the three-way race fairly easily and was sworn into Congress in January 2009.

Ludington Public Library

The Ludington Public Library is one of the two 'branches' of the Mason County District Library administrative system. It is located in downtown Ludington, in Mason County in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The other 'branch' is the Scottville Public Library.
Early history.
The Ludington Public Library started with the Ludington Library Association on April 9, 1872. A meeting was announced for those that were interested in organizing a library. At the time there was interest in a public reading room for the attainment of mental improvement. The meeting was held at Ludington Hall over the Pere Marquette Lumber Company store at the southwest corner of Main Street (now Gaylord Avenue) and Ludington Avenue to effect a permanent organization of a library association. Articles of association were filed April 12, 1872. It was brought up then at an official city meeting on the evening of April 24, 1872 at this same location at the Pere Marquette Lumber Company store (later bought by Pierce Manufacturing Company). The organization was perfected and officers were elected in 1872 and 1874.

Executive committee
On April 30, 1872 a free reading room opened for a 90 day trial. A few days later a letter was received from James Ludington of Milwaukee, expressing his interest in the library idea. In the letter was a draft for $100 to be used in the purchase of books. S. F. White visited Milwaukee in June of that year in the interest of the library association and made a purchase of books. Local citizens donated other suitable books. By the spring of 1874 a sizable library of 300 to 400 books had been gathered. The library association then occupied a small building that stood just south of the Pere Marquette Lumber Company's "Big Store" to be used freely by anyone. 
Soon thereafter various plans were considered for a new location. D. L. Filer, who had always been the president, proposed on behalf of the Pere Marquette Lumber Company to donate a site on Ludington Avenue. In this proposal all the lumber necessary for its construction would be provided. James Ludington was to donate $2500 to the city of Ludington for building the new structure and $1,000 each from D. L. Filer and John Mason Loomis. The new structure was to accommodate the library on the main floor with county offices, a court room, and the city council chambers upstairs. This building with a library, however, was never built since James Ludington didn't come through with his donation because of financial setbacks in Milwaukee. Meanwhile instead there was a Mason County Courthouse built in 1873 on Pere Marquette Street to accommodate the city and county offices only.
Nothing further was done toward plans for a new library structure and in time the matter was all but dropped. The library association subsequently moved to the second floor of the Gebhart Building at the southeast corner of Ludington Avenue and Harrison Street. Later in 1877 the library moved into the Temperance Hall after its new construction. This was at the northeast corner of Ludington Avenue and James Street. Between 1877 and 1881 this library association hosted lectures by guests that included Susan B. Anthony and Schuyler Colfax.
On June 11, 1881, there was a major city fire and the building burned to the ground, destroying all the library contents. There was no insurance and about $500 worth of books were lost. An effort was made by Eugene Allen of the executive committee and a few others to reorganize a new library, however nothing serious came of this for over 20 years. The Central School (later Longfellow School) shared their books with the public for many years, however this was inadequate.
Mid history.
Earnest interest to rebuild a new Ludington library was kept alive in the 1890s by a group of women that had an organization called the Pere Marquette Literary Club.
They first made contact with Andrew Carnegie around 1903 concerning obtaining funds for the construction of a new library. At this time various people offered sites that they would sell for prices ranging from $1,000 to $1,500. Some of these sites were at the corners of Harrison and Loomis as well as Rowe and Court streets and on Ludington Avenue, Emily Street, and Charles Street (now Rath). There was a lot of controversy over the selection of the final library site. The city mayor of the time, Warren A. Cartier, recommended that the matter of "petty jealousies" be worked out and that deciding on the final site location would be brought up again in a later meeting. 
The Pere Marquette Literary Club worked on obtaining the grant from the Carnegie Institution for construction of the new Ludington library. Carnegie wrote back a letter saying that as soon as the city council decided on a free site and could guarantee it then funds would be appropriated. On September 6, 1904, the city council had a meeting and voted to close the deal with Charles G. Wing for the lot at the corner of Ludington Avenue and Rowe Street, site of the former newspaper office of the "Ludington Appeal". They then proceeded to complete the arrangements with Carnegie for the construction funds of $15,000 for the library.
At a city meeting on February 6, 1905, the city approved the plans for a two story building that would take advantage of Carnegie's funds. The building was designed by architect Edward Lippincott Tilton, who was suggested by Carnegie himself. The building was to have reading rooms, cloak rooms, and a lecture room on the second floor. The Ludington Carnegie library building was declared as the library that will last a thousand years. 
The current Ludington Public Library was constructed where the "old Appeal building" once stood. The contractor builder John Anderson received the contract to build the new Carnegie library in 1905. His was the lowest general contractor bid of $11,380.33 of the 6 bids received by the city of Ludington. The local Ludington newspaper then reported the minutes of the city council showing that the plans for the new library and its construction had been approved.
In 1905 Ludington received one of the 53 grants given to Michigan communities from Andrew Carnegie for the construction of libraries. He had a special program that gave grants that would cover the cost of the construction of free public access libraries under certain conditions. A Carnegie Grant of $15,000.00 and matching funds from the City of Ludington was put forth to build and support the new library that exists to this day. 
Andrew Carnegie distributed over 40 million dollars given in grants to United States communities to erect 1,689 libraries. The conditions for these new libraries were that Carnegie would provide the funds for the erection of the building, which was usually equal to about two dollars per local area resident. The local government had to then provide the construction site and an amount equal to 10 percent of the Carnegie grant annually from the city tax revenues to support the newly funded library. The city of Ludington provided the construction site and agreed to $1,500 annually (10% of the construction cost) for maintenance of the building. On March 1, 1906 the library opened. On its opening in March 1906 the library had assembled a collection of 3,800 books.
Later history.
In 1975 a major remodeling and enlargement to the Ludington Public Library was begun. The Mason County voters passed a millage for the construction and additionally Federal revenue-sharing funds were received. Total cost of the new portion was $300,000. The addition was finished and opened to the public in 1976. There has been since this time Friends of the Library, a group assisting the activities of the library. The Zonta Room, named for the local branch of Zonta International, includes extensive genealogical and historical research materials.
Currently the Ludington Public Library has an expansion campaign called Just Imagine where it will be adding a addition. This will be mostly a Children's Library, a large meeting room, and an activities area. The lobby of this addition will have an area of personalized brick "pavers" for those that have donated to the library. There will be a Wall of Recognition at the entrance for special donations to the Vision Campaign. The Ludington library celebrated its centennial in March 2006.
Flights of Learning sculpture.
The "Flights of Learning" 800-pound, seven-and-a-half-foot-tall sculpture is at the front exterior entrance of the Ludington Public Library. The metal sculpture by Utah artist Bryce Pettit took about six months to complete. It was purchased for the downtown Ludington library by John and Anita Wilson. The sculpture came just after the opening of the new wing addition added to the back of the existing library. The new wing is called the Keith Wilson Children’s Center and is named after John Wilson's father. 
The metal sculpture symbolizes the mission of the library. The metal book open at the base of the statue says it all. It explains that parents and members of the community shoulder the responsibility to better the world which can be done in a child's learning. The open book represents a gateway to learning, while the birds represent the knowledge learned through the books. Once the knowledge is released it soars to new heights that enrich and enlighten our lives. The knowledge released through the "Flights of Learning" is an opportunity to new heights of freedom. The birds show different areas of learning and knowledge. The owl represents the knowledge in sciences and mathematics, the falcon represents the knowledge in history, the jay represents the knowledge in literature, the meadowlark represents the knowledge in music, the hummingbird represents the knowledge in fantasy, and the tern represents the knowledge in arts. The artist used his 11 year old daughter as a model for the metal sculpture.
The "Flights of Learning" sculpture was dedicated June 29, 2012. There were dozens of people in attendance. John and Anita Wilson were presented with a scale model of the sculpture they had donated to the library.
The "Flights of Learning" sculpture at the library is a continuation of the sculpture trail that started with nine sculptures at Waterfront Park near downtown Ludington, Michigan.

2009 Giro d'Italia

The 2009 Giro d'Italia was the 92nd running of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It was held from 9 to 31 May 2009, and marked the 100th year since the first edition of the race. Starting in Venice and finishing in Rome, 22 teams competed over 21 stages.
The Giro was raced on a unique path through Italy, taking the peloton to some historic cities and towns in Italian cycling. Though the route lacked any well-known, storied climbs, the many intermediate and mountain stages in the second and third weeks of the race proved deceptively difficult. The 10th and the 16th stages were both called the race's queen stage, as both contained multiple difficult mountain climbs.
Riders protested during the ninth stage, a criterium in Milan. This protest was nominally about the overall safety conditions of the stage, and was sparked by life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before. In the protest, riders declined to contest the stage except for a final sprint finish, a decision that proved controversial with race organizers and fans.
Denis Menchov won the race, having taken the lead in a long time trial in stage 12, and defended vigorously against attacks by his closest challenger, Danilo Di Luca, during the mountain stages of the final week. Di Luca came in second, 41 seconds behind the winner, and won the mauve jersey as points classification winner. Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.
Teams.
Twenty-two teams were announced for the Giro. These included fifteen ProTour teams, and seven Professional Continental teams. Three ProTour teams did not wish to participate, and were thus not invited: , , and . Conversely, the organizers of the race originally declined to invite , but changed this decision on 23 April, inviting them as the Giro's 22nd and final team. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 198 cyclists.
The 22 teams that took part in the race were: 
Race previews and favorites.
The Astana team did not include 2008 race champion Alberto Contador, who chose not to defend his championship, but did include Lance Armstrong, who had recently returned from retirement. Though his appearance was put in doubt after he crashed out of stage 1 of the Vuelta a Castilla y León and broke his collarbone, Armstrong announced on 16 April that he would start the Giro despite undergoing surgery for his injury. star Cadel Evans was originally announced to be taking part in the Giro, but he publicly announced shortly afterward that he would not ride it, and accused RCS Sport (the organizers of the race) of using his name to promote the event. Contador and Evans both chose to focus on the Tour de France later in the season.
Many riders were named as contenders, including Ivan Basso, Levi Leipheimer, Armstrong, Damiano Cunego, Carlos Sastre, Gilberto Simoni, Danilo Di Luca, Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov. Before his collarbone injury, Armstrong was considered an overall favorite, and it was also noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider very likely to gain from having such a long race against the clock included in the Giro.
Former winner Stefano Garzelli named Leipheimer as the favorite, as did some American media outlets. Armstrong considered Basso to be the favorite when speaking about the Giro in December 2008. Other news outlets also referred to Basso as the pre-race favorite.
Only a small number of stages were expected to end in a sprint, barring a successful breakaway. Sprinters in the event included Mark Cavendish, Alessandro Petacchi, Allan Davis, Filippo Pozzato, Robert Hunter, Robert Förster, Tyler Farrar, Juan José Haedo, and Oscar Gatto.
Route and stages.
The first Giro d'Italia was held in 1909, and the 2009 route was designed to commemorate the 100th anniversary, though interruptions due to World War I and World War II meant this was only the 92nd race. Milan, which had for years been the city in which the Giro concluded, was the site of a ten-lap criterium on the same circuit that began the first Giro d'Italia. Every city that hosted a stage start or finish in the first Giro was visited in 2009 with the exception of Genoa, although Arenzano (in the province of Genoa) hosted the finish to stage 11. The 11th stage also went over the Passo del Turchino, a climb used every year in the classic cycling race Milan – San Remo.
The tenth stage was planned to mimic stage 17 of the 1949 Giro d'Italia, which was won by Italian cycling legend Fausto Coppi en route to the overall victory. That route originally included the Col d'Izoard, a climb in France which has been featured in the Tour de France numerous times. Race organizers were forced to alter this stage to cover only the Italian side of the Alps rather than also visit France, as there were concerns over radio communication in the area, and the roads stood the risk of landslides. It was subsequently made longer than first planned, with an additional, shorter climb added. Stages 10 and 16, the latter of which went over Monte Petrano and two other first-category climbs, were both called the race's queen stage.
The route received a small amount of criticism for failing to include any well-known and especially difficult climbs such as the Passo del Mortirolo or Monte Zoncolan, instead including stages featuring multiple climbs with lesser ascents. Race director Angelo Zomegnan responded to the criticism by saying, "I won't follow the philosophy that the selection of climbs has to be determined by their names."
The 21 stages of the 2009 Giro d'Italia were divided into five categories: one team time trial, seven flat stages, four intermediate stages, seven mountain stages and two individual time trials. The type of stage together with the average speed of the winner decided how much time each cyclist would be allowed to finish that stage before being eliminated from the race.
Race overview.
The Giro began with a team time trial in Lido, a barrier island in the city of Venice. The starting order of the teams was decided by a random draw. , the first team to take the course, won the stage, giving their star sprinter Mark Cavendish the first pink jersey as leader of the race. Cavendish was defeated in a sprint finish the following day by Italian Alessandro Petacchi, who was riding for the team. Petacchi became the next wearer of the pink jersey, after he won the Stage 3 sprint into Valdobbiadene. Cavendish went on to win three mass-start stages, but 's success was not limited to Cavendish's victories nor the team time trial, as Edvald Boasson Hagen and Kanstantsin Siutsou also took stage wins.
The first two high mountain stages of the Giro revealed the men who would battle for the overall race title. Danilo Di Luca of took the win in Stage 4, and put himself just 2 seconds off the pink jersey. The next day, he claimed the jersey, when he was second to stage winner Denis Menchov at Alpe di Siusi as an elite group of favorites emerged including Menchov, Di Luca, and others who had performed well on the climb and were in high places in the overall standings. 
Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose to second before stage 12, the very long and hilly individual time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages to make up the time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.
Stefano Garzelli was the winner of the mountains classification, gaining points for consistent high placings on the summit stage finishes, as well as a brief breakaway on the mountainous stage 10. The points classification was won by Di Luca, after he finished in the top ten in eight of the road stages. The youth classification was won by Kevin Seeldraeyers, who remained consistent after Thomas Lövkvist lost nearly 25 minutes on stage 16. Lövkvist had, for one day earlier in the race, led not just the youth but also the general classification.
Controversy arose during the ten-lap Milan criterium of the ninth stage, when the riders staged a protest over what they viewed as unsafe riding conditions in that stage and those that preceded it. The most visible cause for the protest was Rabobank rider Pedro Horrillo's accident during the eighth stage; Horrillo sustained numerous fractures and head injuries after tumbling over a barricade on the roadside while descending the Culmine di San Pietro. Horrillo fell more than , and nearly died as a result of his injuries. After spending five weeks in hospitals in both Italy and his native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered, though the day on the Culmine di San Pietro was his last as a professional cyclist, as he retired before the 2010 season began.
The protest at first only involved the criterium being neutralized – that is, the race director agreed that each rider would receive the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless of when they actually crossed the line. After the riders rode a lap of the course, they decided instead not to contest the stage at all, riding the first six circuits slower than previous stages. After four laps, they stopped altogether as race leader Di Luca addressed the unhappy crowd to explain their actions. The times for the stage did not count, and there was no aggressive riding until a final sprint finish. Along with Di Luca, Lance Armstrong was considered the principal voice speaking for the peloton on this day. Although the protest was referred to by some as "unanimous," cyclists such as Filippo Pozzato, who was himself bearing injuries sustained in a crash that would later force him to leave the race, said the riders had been too hasty in their decision, and that it should have been made conclusively before the stage began. Armstrong apologized to the fans for the effect the protest had on what was supposed to be a grand spectacle, but also contended that it was the correct decision for the peloton to make.
Success in stages was limited to a few teams. Though there were nearly as many stages (21) as teams in the event (22), only eight teams ultimately came away with stage victories. Six different riders won multiple stages – Cavendish, Petacchi, Menchov, Di Luca, Carlos Sastre, and Michele Scarponi. Teammates of Sastre, Scarponi and Cavendish were also stage winners; Sastre's provided the winners to stages 14 (Simon Gerrans) and 21 (Ignatas Konovalovas), and Scarponi's teammate Leonardo Bertagnolli was the winner of stage 15. The only teams to be single stage winners were with Franco Pellizotti in stage 17, and with classics specialist Philippe Gilbert three days later in a stage thought to resemble a classic. Pellizotti was also the third-place overall finisher. With wins for Quick Step's Seeldraeyers in the youth classification, Garzelli of Acqua & Sapone in the climbers' competition, and in the Trofeo Fast Team ranking, 11 teams – half of the total entries – won significant prizes during the race.
Aftermath.
About two months after the event concluded, on 22 July, it was announced that second place overall finisher and points classification winner Di Luca had given two positive tests for continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA, an erythropoietin derivative) on 20 and 28 May, before the Cinque Terre time trial and the Mount Vesuvius stage in the race's final week. He was provisionally suspended with immediate effect by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), cycling's governing body. It was announced on 8 August that the analyses of the B-samples from those controls confirmed the initial results, making it likely that Di Luca will be stripped of some or all of his results from the race. fired him on 13 August. Di Luca at first maintained his innocence and claimed a conspiracy against him by the labs handling the tests. A period of legal maneuvering between Di Luca and the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) followed. CONI officials asked their anti-doping tribunal (TNA) to suspend Di Luca for three years – while two years is a customary ban for a doping positive, CONI prosecutors sought a third year for recidivism, stemming from Di Luca's previous doping incident two years earlier. He was given a two-year suspension, retroactive to July 2009, and indicated that he would appeal it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In October 2010, Di Luca was reinstated to active status by CONI, due to his cooperation with several ongoing doping investigations, though his results were indeed stricken from the record. On 10 January 2011, he signed with and indicated that he would return to the Giro in 2011 to support Katusha team leader Joaquim Rodríguez.
Five days before the start of the 2010 Giro d'Italia, 2009 podium finisher Pellizotti was identified as a rider of interest to the UCI's biological passport program due to irregular blood values. He was removed from his team's start list for the Giro and provisionally suspended. The UCI asked that CONI open disciplinary proceedings against him, which had no resolution until after the 2010 season finished. TNA cleared him on 21 October and declared him free to race, at which time the Liquigas team intended to re-sign him. The UCI decided in January 2011 to appeal his case to the CAS. The hearing was held in March, and Pellizotti asked for a quick resolution, with plans to return with in the 2011 Tirreno–Adriatico if he were cleared. The court reached its decision after five days, upholding the UCI's appeal, handing Pellizotti a two-year ban, and stripping all his results from this Giro and the 2009 Tour de France. Consequently, Pellizotti has said he is quitting the sport.
Classification leadership.
In the 2009 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.
Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.
There was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the "Cima Coppi"), which in 2009 was Sestrière in stage 10, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.
The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, which awarded a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1984 were eligible.
There were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.
The rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.
Final standings.
Minor classifications.
Other less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the "Traguardo Volante", or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known in previous years as the "Intergiro" and the "Expo Milano 2015" classification. It was won by Italian Giovanni Visconti, of .
Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Mountains classification winner Stefano Garzelli won this award. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were only awarded for the top three finishers in each stage. It was won, like the closely associated points classification, by Danilo Di Luca. Additionally, the "Trofeo Fuga Cervelo" rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. 's Mauro Facci was first in this competition. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. and were most successful in avoiding penalties, and so shared leadership of the Fair Play classification.
World Rankings points.
The Giro was one of 24 events throughout the season that contributed points towards the 2009 UCI World Ranking. Points were awarded to the top 20 finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage.

Court of Great Sessions in Wales

The Court of Great Sessions in Wales was the main court for the prosecution of felonies and serious misdemeanours in Wales between the second Laws in Wales Act of 1542 and the court's abolition in 1830. It had the same powers in civil law as the King's Bench in England, (it also had equity jurisdiction) and its criminal jurisdiction was equivalent to the English county assizes.
The Court was established under the 1542 Act which formally incorporated Wales within the English legal system. Of the 13 Welsh counties, 12 - that is, all except the County of Monmouth - formed new court circuits. These were Chester (comprising the counties of Flint, Denbigh and Mountgomery); North Wales (Anglesea and the counties of Caernarvon and Merioneth); Brecon (the counties of Brecon, Glamorgan, and Radnor); and Carmarthen (the counties of Kayermarthen, Cardigan, and Pembroke). Monmouthshire was added to the Oxford circuit of the English Assizes. The Sessions met twice a year in each county, administering English law in the English language: of the 217 judges who sat on its benches in its 288 years of existence, only 30 were Welshmen and it is unlikely that more than a handful of the latter - members of the higher gentry - actually spoke Welsh. 
According to historian John Davies, the treatment of Monmouthshire in this arrangement was the cause of the erroneous belief that the county had been annexed by England rather than remaining part of Wales.
The National Library of Wales holds the surviving historical records of the Court of Great Sessions.

Diversified Specialty Institute Holdings, Inc.

Diversified Specialty Institute is a healthcare group created in 2003 whose purpose is to build and operate hospitals across the nation. While the group’s primary task is the operation of over a hundred dialysis clinics around the nation, DSI is on the forefront of hospital construction technology with operations including the state-of-the-art breast cancer treatment facility in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
History.
DSI was originally founded in Nashville during 2003. While the group found a rocky start with only five employees in the beginning, over the next few years DSI was able to created a modular design for hospital buildings, reducing the cost and time to create the building while actually improving the quality of the facility.
In April 2006, financed by Centre Partners, a leading private equity firm, DSI was able to purchase 105 dialysis clinics and four other programs from Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, inc. The purchase made DSI the third largest dialysis provider at the time.
In July of the same year, DSI set its first modular building in Bucks County. The modular units, produced in Conyers, Georgia were shipped to Bucks County and a twelve patient hospital wing was laid out in less than eight hours. This marked a milestone for both DSI and the medical community, showing that quality hospitals could be created in record time.
In April 2009, the hospital facility in Bucks County, PA filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7. The bankruptcy was actually filed under "Bucks County Oncoplastic Institute."
Technology.
DSI pursues and utilizes the best technology the medical industry has to offer. For instance, all files are stored electronically which has improved efficiency and confidentiality while streamlining patient records and treatment. All personnel are trained on the system and capable of easily tracking their patients’ progress and are thus able to treat them more effectively.
PEARL
DSI and its predecessor were able to create the medical software PEARL, which is used to track patients’ status, ensure that medications and operations are performed in a timely fashion, and allow a streamlined interface between doctors and their staffs. This system is used in all DSI facilities.
Modular Construction
From the beginning of DSI, modular construction for hospital facilities was envisioned. While many skeptics denied that it was possible, after a rigorous production program, DSI was able to also design their first modular clinic. The facility not only met health department standards but exceeded them in many departments. Combined with the advanced technology and DSI’s creative strive, many of the facilities can be considered the highest technology healthcare facilities in the United States.
In mid-2006, DSI laid its first modular hospital, including a twelve patient wing, in less than eight hours. Actual time to set the building is around two days. The entire construction cycle, from the time that the building is ordered until the time that the facility receives a certificate of occupancy is barely over four months, compared to the standard six months to a year that it takes to erect a facility using standard construction methods.
Current and future projects.
DSI is currently working on an economical pharmaceutical service in which dialysis patients can have their prescriptions sent directly to their clinic through DSI. This means that instead of having to go to a local pharmacy to place and pick up prescription orders, DSI will ensure that all prescriptions arrive on time at the clinic and will eliminate the cost and hassle of going to the pharmacy for the patient.
Going along with DSI’s desire to be environmentally responsible, DSI set up a research study during the summer of 2008 in order to investigate how the facilities can become more energy efficient and “go green.” Currently, research into wind turbine and solar photo-voltaic technology is being conducted to improve facilities’ energy efficiency and reduce their global footprint. Likewise, water reclamation technology is being pursued.

RemoteView

RemoteView is the family name of a group of software programs designed to aid in analyzing satellite or aerial images of the Earth's surface for the purpose of collecting and disseminating geospatial intelligence. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is a longtime user of RemoteView software. The software is published by Overwatch Systems, Ltd., an operating unit of Textron Systems.
Overview.
RemoteView was the first successful electronic light table application to be widely available, initially developed and released commercially by Sensor Systems in 1996. An electronic light table application makes it possible for imagery analysts to review satellite images on a computer instead of examining film or printed photographs. RemoteView was originally written only for the Unix operating system, but as the US Department of Defense transitioned to the Windows operating system, Sensor Systems released a Windows-based version that soon became a primary tool used by the intelligence community. Overwatch acquired Sensor Systems and the RemoteView software in 2005. Textron Systems acquired Overwatch in 2006.
RemoteView's main function is an imagery and geospatial analysis tool. It can display a wide array of imagery formats, elevation data sets, and vector data sets. Capabilities include image enhancements, photogrammetry, orthorectification, multispectral classification, pan sharpening, change detection, assisted search, location positioning, and 3D terrain visualization. These features allow an intelligence analyst to review large-scale imagery and generate annotated reports on any findings.
RemoteView for Windows comes in two versions, RemoteView Desktop and RemoteView Pro. RemoteView Desktop is an entry-level imagery exploitation and analysis solution, for focusing on a single image at a time or reviewing the results of another analyst's work. RemoteView Pro is the flagship product offering a greater number of tools, extensions, and capabilities.
Extensions.
Overwatch offers a series of extensions that add specialized capabilities to RemoteView. These include:

<doc id="18733955" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18733955" title="United States v. Vuitch">
United States v. Vuitch

United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971) was a United States Supreme Court abortion rights case, which held that the District of Columbia's abortion law banning the practice except when necessary for the health or life of the woman was not unconstitutionally vague.
Background.
Milan Vuitch, an abortion provider in the District of Columbia, had several times come under suit for providing abortion services that the government deemed not necessary for the life or health of the woman, in accordance with the DC law. Vuitch challenged the law as being unconstitutionally vague with regard to the term "health." Federal District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell agreed, dismissing Vuitch's indictment and ruling that the law failed to give the sufficient certainty required by due process of law in criminal matters.
Gesell's finding was the first federal court decision declaring an abortion law unconstitutional.
Decision.
There were two questions before the court: 1. Whether they had jurisdiction to decide the case, and 2. Whether the D.C. law was unconstitutionally vague. On the first question, Justice Black, joined by Burger, Douglas, Stewart, and Byron White, held that they could. On the second question, Harlan and Blackmun, although dissenting in jurisdiction, joined Black on the merits, while Douglas and Stewart joined Brennan and Marshall in dissent.
On the merits, Black held that "health" was not vague, since lower courts had construed it fairly concretely to mean physical as well as psychological health. Although this was the final (as well as the first) abortion case prior to "Roe", only Justice Douglas, writing in dissent, suggested the existence of a general right to abortion as part of a broader right to privacy. This view would be embraced by seven Justices in "Roe" two years later.
Significance.
Vuitch lost in the sense that the statute was ruled not "vague"; the district court's decision was overturned and Vuitch could be prosecuted. However, the decision treated abortion as a surgical option not fundamentally different from any other, and the Court seemed to care most about sufficient leeway being given to a doctor's professional judgement.
The justices voted to hear "Roe v. Wade" and "Doe v. Bolton", other abortion cases, the day after "Vuitch"s opinion was announced.

<doc id="18733960" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18733960" title="Christian Gerhartsreiter">
Christian Gerhartsreiter

Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter (born February 21, 1961) is a German man who is currently serving a life sentence in the United States for murder. In his late teens Gerhartsreiter moved to the US, where he lived under a succession of aliases while variously claiming to be an art collector, a physicist, a ship's captain, a negotiator of international debt agreements, and an English aristocrat. He was quite plausible and one point was hired to work in a brokerage firm. 
In 1995 while using the assumed identity, Clark Rockefeller, he married a successful businesswoman. The couple had one child, a daughter. Gerhartsreiter lived a prosperous lifestyle solely on his wife's income. She became dissatisfied with his secretive, controlling behavior and sought a divorce. Inquiries on her behalf revealed he had fabricated his name and family background. The couple divorced and Gerhartsreiter agreed to limited access to his daughter on supervised visits. Gerhartsreiter was arrested in 2008, six days after he abducted his daughter while she was on a visit. He was subsequently convicted of the custodial kidnapping of his daughter. Gerhartsreiter's true identity was discovered after his arrest. Police had been seeking him since the eighties as a suspect in the disappearance of a married couple. He was subsequently convicted of the 1985 murder of a man in California and is now serving 27 years to life in California prison.
Early life.
According to his parents, Simon and Ermengard Gerhartsreiter, Christian was born on February 21, 1961 in Siegsdorf, Bavaria, Germany, although he maintains that he was born on February 29, 1960. Gerhartsreiter told Boston police that his mother is Ann Carter, an American child actress of the 1940s, which Carter has denied.
Travel to the USA and first marriage.
In 1978 he met an American couple, Elmer and Jean Kelln, who were traveling through Germany. Later he used their names to obtain permission to go to the US, falsely saying that the Kellns had invited him to come stay with them in California. He initially made his way to Berlin, Connecticut where he found a family (the Savios) willing to let him live with them and was accepted as a foreign exchange student at Berlin High School in 1979. He told the Savios that he was from a wealthy family in Germany. Eventually he wore out his welcome with the Savios and was told to leave. 
Gerhartsreiter had the idea when he came to the US that he wanted to become an actor, so he headed toward California. By the time he reached Milwaukee he had changed his name to Chris Gerhart. While there, he enrolled in a class at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Realizing that he wanted to become a US citizen he sought a woman who would marry him. He married 22-year-old Amy Jersild Duhnke in 1981 in Madison, Wisconsin, purportedly to obtain his green card. To convince her to marry him, he falsely claimed that if he had to go back to Germany, he would have to go into the Army and would be sent to fight in the Cold War on the Russian front line. After the marriage took place, Gerhartsreiter left his wife and headed for California. Duhnke filed for divorce in 1992 and, according to the divorce papers, claimed that Gerhartsreiter left her the day after the wedding.
Second Marriage.
In 1995, Gerhartsreiter married Sandra Boss in a Quaker ceremony that had no legal status. The couple had a daughter. Sandra Boss changed her child's surname after her reported divorce from Gerhartsreiter, in part because he refused to provide proof of his identity. During the case, Boss, a high-earning McKinsey senior executive who had graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Business School, accused him of lying about being a member of the Rockefeller family. Members of the Rockefeller family have also denied any relation to the man. Boss testified in June 2009 at his trial that Gerhartsreiter agreed to give her custody of their daughter following the divorce. She testified that he also agreed to supervised visits three times a year with their daughter in return for an $800,000 settlement, two cars, her engagement ring, and a dress that he had given her. Boss moved with their child to London following the divorce. 
Boss testified that Gerhartsreiter was charming and that she believed the stories he told her at the beginning of their relationship. Later, however, he became emotionally abusive and there was a "lot of anger and yelling" in their household. Although Boss earned all of the family income, she testified that Gerhartsreiter had complete control of the family's finances and other aspects of her day-to-day life.
She hired a private investigator in 2006 and discovered that Gerhartsreiter was not who he claimed to be, though she did not learn his real name at that time. She said he was unpleasant to live with, but did not think he was delusional. 
Prior to the divorce, Gerhartsreiter had lived with Boss and their child in Cornish, New Hampshire, where he used his supposed family ties to bolster his reputation, telling friends and neighbors that he was a wealthy Yale graduate who owned a business in Canada. Gerhartsreiter, under the name Clark Rockefeller, was also a member of Boston's Algonquin Club, where he spent a great deal of time. He resigned as one of the club's directors in April 2008.
Custodial kidnapping and assault conviction.
On July 27, 2008, Gerhartsreiter abducted his daughter at about 12:45 p.m. in a black sport utility vehicle. Boston police searched the area of the incident without success, and Massachusetts State Police issued an Amber Alert just before 5 p.m. Later that night police issued a warrant for Gerhartsreiter's arrest. He was charged with custodial kidnapping, assault and battery, and assault with a deadly weapon — the sport utility vehicle.
Boston police said Gerhartsreiter, his daughter, and a social worker were in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood at the intersection of Marlborough and Arlington streets, traveling on foot from the Four Seasons Hotel Boston to the Boston Common when a sport utility vehicle drove up. Gerhartsreiter allegedly grabbed his daughter, pushed the social worker aside, and jumped into the vehicle, which then sped off. The social worker grabbed onto the vehicle and was dragged a short distance before letting go. He was treated for minor injuries at Massachusetts General Hospital and released. Police searched the immediate area and Logan International Airport that day. The same day police received calls reporting sightings of the child in Dedham, Hyde Park, and even New York's Grand Central Station. Police reported they followed up on all leads, but had nothing solid by the end of the day. 
Apprehension.
On August 3, 2008 after a week-long search, Gerhartsreiter was found in Baltimore, Maryland where he had recently purchased an apartment for about $450,000 under the name Charles "Chip" Smith. With the help of the owner of a local marina where Gerhartsreiter had apparently kept a catamaran for the past nine years, FBI agents were able to lure him out of the apartment with a telephone call telling him the boat was taking on water. He was arrested as he left the apartment and was charged with kidnapping and assault and battery. The child was found unharmed inside the apartment.
Identification.
On August 15, 2008, the FBI, the Massachusetts State Police, the Boston Police Department, and the Suffolk County District Attorney identified Clark Rockefeller as Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter. He was conclusively identified by means of forensic examinations conducted by the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia. When Gerhartsreiter, using the name Clark Rockefeller, was arrested, his fingerprint impressions were taken by FBI agents in Baltimore and by Boston Police when he was returned to Massachusetts. Those fingerprints were compared to latent fingerprints lifted from a variety of sources. They matched a latent print lifted from a wine glass in Boston collected at the time of the search for "Rockefeller" and his daughter earlier in the month. Those fingerprints also match a latent print developed from a document in Gerhartsreiter's immigration file from the early 1980s. Although there were no fingerprint cards or inked impressions in the immigration file, an FBI laboratory was able to develop latent print impressions from a document in that file, which had been provided by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Through fingerprint analysis, the FBI confirmed his identity. 
Alexander Gerhartsreiter, who lives in Bergen, Upper Bavaria, identified Rockefeller as his brother, stating they are the sons of Simon and Irmgard Gerhartsreiter, a painter and homemaker. 
Gerhartsreiter went to great lengths to conceal his true identity from his wife, Sandra Boss. He repeatedly told her she should file her tax return as a single person, and later in their marriage, when his wife's firm required that a certified public accountant do her taxes, he found an accountant for her. After their divorce, Boss learned that he had told their accountant he was her brother so that the accountant would continue filing single tax returns for her.
Aside from Clark Rockefeller, other aliases used by Gerhartsreiter included: Chris C. Crowe, Chris Chichester, Charles Smith, and Chip Smith, among others.
Prosecution.
On September 3, 2008, Gerhartsreiter was charged with furnishing a false name to a law enforcement officer following an arrest. His lawyers later argued that he did not do this for dishonest purposes.
On October 2, 2008, at a hearing requested by defense attorney Stephen Hrones, bail was revoked. Hrones had requested the hearing in order to seek a reduction from the $50 million cash bail under which the defendant had previously been held. Instead, the judge ordered the defendant to be held without bail.
On February 13, 2009, Gerhartsreiter's attorneys filed notice that they intended to use an insanity defense for him.
During the trial, conducted in Boston in May and June 2009, Gerhartsreiter's defense team told jurors that Gerhartsreiter believed his daughter had communicated with him telepathically from London, where she and her mother moved after the divorce, begging him to rescue her. 
Two defense experts testified that they have diagnosed Gerhartsreiter with delusional disorder, grandiose type, and narcissistic personality disorder. One of the defense experts, Dr. Keith Ablow, testified that Gerhartsreiter told him that his father had been emotionally abusive during his childhood. Dr. James Chu, a psychiatrist for the prosecution, testified that he had diagnosed Gerhartsreiter with a "'mixed personality disorder', with narcissistic and anti-social traits" but felt that Gerhartsreiter had exaggerated his symptoms of mental illness and was capable of knowing right from wrong, particularly since he allegedly meticulously planned the details of the abduction well in advance. Gerhartsreiter did not take the witness stand. 
Closing arguments concluded on June 8, On June 12, 2009, the jury found Gerhartsreiter guilty of the charges of parental kidnapping and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He was found not guilty of the charge of assault and battery and of using a false name. The judge sentenced him to four to five years in state prison on the kidnapping count and a concurrent two to three years on the assault charge. 
Jonathan Sohus murder conviction.
Gerhartsreiter was initially identified as a "person of interest" by police in the 1985 disappearance and possible murder of Jonathan Sohus, a California man in whose guesthouse he lived as a tenant in the upscale community of San Marino, during the mid-1980s. Bones believed to belong to Sohus were found in 1994 buried in the back yard of the home he had lived in with his wife, Linda, who is also missing. Sohus's family members said the bones match Jonathan Sohus's general description but, since he was adopted, there was no way to compare his DNA against that of biological family members and arrive at a conclusive identity.
Gerhartsreiter, who was then using the alias Christopher Chichester, reportedly told people that Jonathan and Linda Sohus had traveled to Europe. Their family reportedly received a postcard from the couple sent from France after Jonathan and Linda Sohus had disappeared, though its authenticity has been questioned. "Chichester" was pulled over by police in Greenwich, Connecticut, in the late 1980s driving a pickup truck that had belonged to Jonathan Sohus, but he left the area before police could interview him. Police had no proof that Jonathan and Linda Sohus were dead or had not left voluntarily. News reports indicated that a grand jury was to be convened in the spring of 2009 to examine the evidence in the Sohus case. The Hon. Frank Gaziano, judge in Gerhartsreiter's parental kidnapping trial, barred prosecutors from presenting evidence about the Sohus case to avoid prejudicing jurors against Gerhartsreiter.
On March 15, 2011, Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Gerhartsreiter with the murder of Jonathan Sohus.
On October 17, 2011, an Alhambra Superior Court judge ordered Gerhartsreiter to appear in court there on January 18, 2012 for a preliminary hearing where a judge was to decide if enough evidence existed for the case to go to trial. On January 24, 2012, Judge Jared Moses of Alhambra Superior Court ruled that Gerhartsreiter must stand trial for the death of Sohus. The murder trial was held in March and April 2013 and Gerhartsreiter was convicted of first degree murder on April 10, 2013. The verdict includes an enhancement for use of a deadly weapon to bludgeon Jonathan Sohus to death. Forensic evidence showed that Sohus had been struck in the head two times with a rounded, blunt object and then stabbed six times. His body had been cut in three parts. Evidence in the case was largely circumstantial, but jurors were most swayed by two plastic book bags found buried with Sohus's remains: one from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where Gerhartsreiter attended classes between 1979 and 1982, and one from the University of Southern California, where Gerhartsreiter audited film classes. One juror said that was the most solid piece of evidence presented to the jury. Jurors also heard evidence that Gerhartsreiter was in possession of the Sohus' pickup truck following the murder.
On August 15, 2013, Christian Gerhartsreiter was given the maximum sentence of 27 years to life. After he was convicted, Gerhartsreiter fired his lawyers and represented himself during the sentencing phase. Gerhartsreiter maintained his innocence during the sentencing hearing and said, "I want to assert my innocence and that I firmly believe that the victim's wife killed the victim, but be that as it may, once again, I did not commit the crime."
"Clark Rockefeller" in popular culture.
Cable TV network Lifetime premiered the movie "Who Is Clark Rockefeller?" on March 13, 2010, with Eric McCormack in the title role and Sherry Stringfield as Sandra Boss. The DVD was released on September 14, 2010.
Journalist Mark Seal published a non-fiction account of Gerhartsreiter called "The Man in the Rockefeller Suit" (2011). The book is in preliminary development to be made into a movie by Fox Searchlight, directed by Walter Salles and produced by Donald De Line.
American author Amity Gaige published a novelized version of Gerhartsreiter's life in "Schroder: A Novel" (2013), about Erik Schroder, an East German refugee who comes to America and reinvents himself pretending that he's a WASP-ish distant relation of American royalty and calling himself "Eric Kennedy". calls the novel "absorbing, with a propulsive plot and a narrator who is charming, ambivalent, and searching - a man driven by love who understands that love cannot save him."

Harry &amp; Son

Harry & Son is a 1984 American drama film directed by Paul Newman, who also stars. The screenplay by Newman and Ronald Buck focuses on the relationship between a blue-collar worker and his son (Robby Benson), who fails at various odd jobs while aspiring to be a writer.
Joanne Woodward, Ellen Barkin, Ossie Davis, Wilford Brimley and Judith Ivey also star.
Much of the film was shot in Lake Worth, Florida. The movie set construction site was the demolition of the sister hotel affiliated with the Gulf Stream Hotel named The Inn.
Plot.
Widower Harry Keach is a construction worker who was raised to appreciate the importance of working for a living. He takes a dim view of his sensitive son Howard's lackadaisical lifestyle, devoted to a dead-end part-time job, surfing, chasing girls, and hot-tubbing while he dreams of becoming the next Ernest Hemingway. Harry also has a strained relationship with his daughter Nina because he dislikes her husband, an insurance salesman. 
When intense headaches and impaired vision cause Harry to lose control of the wrecking ball on his crane, he loses his job. His unemployment leaves him feeling frustrated, although he refuses to work in his brother Tom's military surplus store. He becomes increasingly angry at Howard for quitting jobs at a car wash and with an auto-repo outfit and threatens to throw his son out of the house.
Harry spends some of his free time visiting his widowed neighbor Lilly, a pet store owner who has loved Harry for years. Her daughter Katie, a former girlfriend of Howard, is now pregnant with another man's child.
After being abandoned by her lover, Katie's relationship with Howard rekindles. He is resisting the advances of a nymphomaniacal older woman, Sally, but eventually introduces her to Harry.
Howard succeeds in selling a short story, much to his father's amazement. He uses some of the money to finance a vacation for Harry, Lilly, Katie and her newborn baby (also called Harry). Harry begins to experience happiness at last, until tragedy strikes.
Critical reception.
The film received negative reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of the "New York Times" called the film "a decently intentioned but rather drab mess of a movie" and added, "Mr. Newman has done creditable work as a director before . . . but "Harry and Son" looks like a first effort, partly because the screenplay has no focus and no particular tone of voice . . . Though the characters use a lot of words that are still taboo on television, the entire project feels as small and dated as a "Studio One" show of the 1950s."
Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" rated the film one star and commented, "This movie looks like the aftermath of an explosion in the story department. It's about everything. They give us so many relationships, so many problems, so many emotional hazards, so many colorful characters, we need a battery-lighted ballpoint, so we can take notes in the dark."
Although "Time Out London" felt the film was "well acted and elegantly photographed," it thought overall "It is nothing more than a constant succession of the kind of emotional peaks actors love to do on screen. Humbler scenes involving background or narrative, which may be immensely tedious to act but help the plot unfold, have in general been left out altogether. The result is a curiously indigestible phenomenon, like being forced to eat five courses of avocado by an overbearing dinner-party host."
Rotten Tomatoes maintains the film with a 22% "rotten" rating. Robby Benson's performance in the film earned him a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor.

<doc id="18734014" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18734014" title="Superman vs. Muhammad Ali">
Superman vs. Muhammad Ali

Superman vs. Muhammad Ali is an oversize comic book published by DC Comics in 1978. The 72-page book features Superman teaming up with the heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali to defeat an alien invasion of Earth. It was based on an original story by Dennis O'Neil which was adapted by Neal Adams, with pencils by Adams, and figure inks by Dick Giordano with background inks by Terry Austin.
Publication history.
"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali" was part of DC's oversized series "All-New Collectors' Edition", officially numbered #C-56.
By the late 1970s, Superman had already been paired in the comics pages with real-life American icons like John F. Kennedy, Steve Allen, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, Allen Funt, Don Rickles, and Pat Boone. He had even previously gone up against a real-life athlete, the professional wrestler Antonino Rocca.
The book suffered numerous delays, going from an original publication date of fall 1977 to spring 1978. By the time the book was published, Ali was no longer World Heavyweight Champion, having been dethroned by Leon Spinks in February 1978. (Ali won back the title later that year in September.)
2010 Re-issue.
In December 2009, DC Comics announced it would publish two hardcover reprint editions of "Superman vs. Muhammad Ali" in the fall of 2010. One edition reprinted the original story at its original treasury size, while a deluxe edition (featuring a new cover by Neal Adams) included additional content dating back to the original book's publication.
Plot summary.
Rat'Lar, the maniacal leader of a species of aliens called the Scrubb, demands that Earth's greatest champion fight the greatest Scrubb fighter. If Earth refuses, the Scrubb and their huge armada of spaceships will destroy it. Superman and Muhammad Ali each come forward to volunteer. However, Ali argues that Superman is not really of Earth, and has an unfair advantage in his many superpowers. In typical Ali-style verbiage, he puts himself forward as the obvious choice.
Intrigued, Rat'Lar decides that Superman and Ali should fight one another to see who really is Earth's champion. To make the fight fair, he decrees that the match should take place on his home planet, Bodace, which orbits a red sun (which temporarily robs Superman of his powers). The winner would simply be the best boxer. The two would-be champions decide that Ali will train Superman in the finer points of boxing. They journey to Superman's Fortress of Solitude to have his powers temporarily deactivated.
The Superman vs. Muhammad Ali match is broadcast on intergalactic television to thousands of other worlds (with Superman's pal Jimmy Olsen acting as broadcaster). With match underway, it soon becomes apparent that in battling with more or less equal strength, Ali is the superior fighter. Superman takes a serious pummeling, but somehow refuses to fall down; he stays on his feet all through the beating. Finally, Ali stops the fight, urging the referee to call for a technical knockout. Superman then falls face-first on the canvas (making the knockout more than technical).
Now crowned Earth's champion, Ali is set to face the Scrubb's champion, the behemoth Hun'Ya. The alien leader then asks Ali to predict at what round the fight will end. (Ali was known for predicting the round in which he would knock out his opponent.) After some chiding, Ali predicts that he’ll knock the alien out in the fourth round ("He'll hit the floor in four!"). Once the match begins, however, Ali quickly starts to suffer from fighting the super-powered Hun'Ya.
Meanwhile, Superman's great recuperative powers have enabled him to make a speedy recovery. Disguising himself as Ali cornerman Bundini Brown, he steals into the Scrubb command ship and sabotages their space armada. In his showdown with the armada, however, Superman is again badly hurt, and is left drifting in space.
Miraculously, Ali gets a second wind. In the predicted fourth round, he not only knocks the alien champion out, but out of the ring as well. Yet after witnessing Superman's decimation of his forces, the Scrubb leader cries foul and decides to invade the now helpless Earth anyway. Just as Rat'Lar is about to give the go-ahead to his backup forces, his own champion Hun'Ya becomes enraged at Rat'Lar's dishonorable tactics and deposes him. There will be no invasion. Earth is saved.
Superman is rescued and once again revived. Hun-ya, the new Scrubb leader, makes peace with Ali, Superman, and all of Earth. The very end of the book shows Ali and Superman in a private moment. Ali reveals that he figured out Superman's secret identity as Clark Kent, but implicitly vows to keep it secret. The book ends with the two champions embracing and Ali proclaiming, "Superman, WE are the greatest!"
The cover.
"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali"'s wraparound cover shows a host of late 1970s celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, Tony Orlando, Johnny Carson, the cast of "Welcome Back, Kotter", and The Jackson 5; sharing close-up seating with Wonder Woman, Batman, Green Lantern, and other DC superheroes; as well as Warner and DC employees.
Joe Kubert was originally asked to draw the cover, and his version (a black-and-white sketch of which still survives) didn't feature any celebrities, but just a "normal" raucous crowd of boxing fans. DC didn't approve of Kubert's likeness of Ali, however, nor the overall grim feeling of the piece, and asked Adams to draw the book instead. Adams' original cover illustration (modeled very closely on Kubert's layout), included Mick Jagger in the front cover's lower left corner; he was replaced in the final version by fight promoter Don King.
In 2000, Adams did a riff on this cover — featuring Ali fighting basketball star Michael Jordan — for a special issue of "ESPN The Magazine".

1978–79 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1978-79 campaign was Town's penultimate season in their 5-year stint in the Football League's basement division. It also saw the arrival of Mick Buxton at the club, he would be Town's second longest manager in the club's history. After replacing Tom Johnston, Town gained a resurgence in their form and then finished in 9th place. It would be a precursor to Town's championship winning team the next season.
Review.
Following on from the previous season's disappointments and the early season's poor form, Tom Johnston resigned and following a spell as caretaker, Mick Buxton became the new manager and helped Town recover their form mainly from the signing from Bury and the conversion of Keith Hanvey from midfield to defence to partner Dave Sutton in the centre.
Town would finish the season in 9th place with just 47 points, but the following season would see Town return to Division 3 in style.

Animals came to it and drank it and they became funny too. The narrator is revealed to be Garfield and he is reading the story to Odie. Jon calls them for breakfast. He cooks breakfast while doing a disco act and he tells Garfield and Odie that he is doing it for the "Fun Fest" (he says he has been doing it since 1978, the year the first Garfield script came out), a talent show which is held every year at the Comic Studios to see who would be the first comic on the cartoon page, and all the comic strip character participate in the competition. Odie shows that he is doing a mime, and Jon tells Garfield he should do a dance with Arlene, which she wanted to do for years but Garfield wanted to do something different. They drive to the Comic Studio with Arlene and Nermal (who teases Garfield).
The Comic Studio is all decorated for the "Fun Fest", and everybody is practicing for it. Then they get to work, but it's "Fun Fest" auditions instead. Charles the Director chooses Betty, Bonnie Bear, and Bonita Stegman as the judges for "Fun Fest." Garfield performs all the great scenes from all the great movies in 30 seconds with Arlene ("James Bond", "Tarzan", "The Wizard of Oz", "Titanic" etc.) After the auditions, Arlene comes into the living room with Garfield, telling him that she really wants to do the tango dance this year. She gives Garfield his costume. But Billy Bear, Randy Rabbit, and Wally all laugh at it. Garfield rejects Arlene's idea, and gives her another idea, which Arlene finds not amusing. A cat named Ramón comes in and tells Arlene that he wants to do the dance with her. Arlene starts to like him which makes Garfield jealous. Ramón is successful at the auditions.
During the night, Garfield reads the storybook. In the morning, Odie (in his mime costume) comes in and shows Garfield it's Fun Fest that night. Jon calls Garfield and Odie for breakfast. Odie finds an envelope in the storybook and tries to get Garfield to read it in the kitchen, the car, and the dining room at the Comic Studio. All three attempts fail (because Garfield thinks Odie is playing a game of "Mailman" and is trying to cheer Garfield up). Odie tries to get Garfield to read it in the break room of the Comic Studio. This attempt is successful and Garfield opens the envelope. Garfield finds a map to the Funny Water in the envelope. He sets the map on the table in the living room and Garfield demonstrates his plan. He'll go to the Funny Water to drink it and get funny in time for "Fun Fest" in the evening. However, Garfield knows its fiction, and rejects his own idea. Garfield and Odie leave for the Funny Water, after he sees Arlene in Ramón's strip.
According to the map, Garfield and Odie must first go through the Mystical Forest. While in the forest, Garfield and Odie meets certain misfits like Stan the Squirrel who annoys Garfield with his curtains. He also meets Junior the Bear who shows Garfield he should go right at a fork in the road saying "To get to the magic pond tonight, follow your heart and you'll always be right" (He is called by his mother who tells him that he should go to dinner). Garfield thinks that they should go right. But Odie disagrees by showing Garfield that he thinks that since their hearts are on the left side of their bodies, then if they follow their hearts, they must go left. They follow Odie's idea and they go left. Garfield and Odie come across a river and try to cross it, but they find out that there are alligators in the river. Two birds tell the duo that they should do stupid things and get the alligators to laugh so they can cross the river. Garfield tries to act stupid, but the alligators don't laugh. Garfield gives up and Odie decides to help Garfield and does stupid things causing the alligators to laugh loudly. While the alligators laugh, Garfield and Odie manage to get across the river. Garfield goes to a pond, supposedly the Funny Water, and he drinks the water. Then they see a tall frog in a mumu on a leaf, and the leaf floats near Garfield and Odie, and the frog goes onto land. The frog tells Garfield and Odie the water is not the funny water and it really is sludge water from a nearby town. Garfield spits the water out in disgust.
The frog reveals himself to be Freddy Frog from the story and tells Garfield that the magic pond (where the Funny Water is) had been moved years ago. Freddy puts Garfield and Odie through a series of comical challenges and they succeed as Freddy teaches Garfield how to be funny. Garfield and Odie reach the funny water by climbing up a really high ladder to a floating island and Garfield drinks it as well as saving some in a bottle. The two realize they won't make it back in time for Fun Fest so Freddy provides them with a hang glider, telling them that all landings end with a crash. Garfield and Odie push it and fall down a cliff and almost collapse. However, the glider flies back into the air. After a bumpy flight, Garfield and Odie crash into the building and sees his role as host was given to Ramón because Garfield didn't show up.
Garfield is about to drink the Funny Water he saved earlier, when he realizes the bottle got smashed when he landed the glider. Garfield believes he is no longer funny and feels too depressed to perform, especially without Arlene, and goes to the back alley. Freddy appears before him and Garfield begs him for more Funny Water. Freddy then tells him that the Funny Water is just regular water and he doesn't need it. Freddy tells Garfield that he was being an egotistical, primadonna and competitive instead of making people laughing. Garfield claims he felt funnier after he drank the water and Freddy tells him that's because he IS funny and that he'd only forgotten to follow his heart (like Junior Bear said). But Freddy then encourages Garfield, his new friend, along with Odie, and Garfield knows how to fix everything... Tango!
Garfield puts on his Tango costume and confronts Ramón while he is dancing with Arlene. Ramón throws Garfield onto the ceiling, but Garfield ties a rope to himself and jumps down. Garfield and Ramón fight over Arlene, and cause a small tornado. Garfield and Arlene are flung to the ceiling and the two dance in the ceiling, but Ramón grabs Arlene and brings her back to the ground. Garfield tugs at Ramon's leg, and it falls off. Garfield continues to pull off Ramon's body parts. Garfield manages to outdance Ramón who turns out to be Nermal in disguise. Garfield then apologizes to Arlene as he finishes the dance with her. As they finish the dance the judges declare them the winners, all giving them ten points. Nermal tells Odie he'll be Pierre (his new disguise) next year. Odie rejects it. Freddy then concludes the story, and closes the story book. He then flies home on the glider.

Huta Stepańska

Huta Stepańska was an ethnic Polish village, located in prewar Kostopol county, Wołyń Voivodeship, in the Second Polish Republic. In 1943, during the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia, it became an important Polish self-defence centre, captured by the UPA between 16 and 18 July 1943. Some 2,000 UIA soldiers, supported by 3,000 local Ukrainian peasants, killed 300 Poles (other sources put number of victims at 600), as they were trying to break out of the encirclement.
History.
The village of Huta Stepańska was founded in the end of the 17th century in the scorched areas of the "Stepańska Wilderness". Its founders were members of the poor Polish noble family of Sawiccy, who had come there from Zhytomyr. In the registry books in the 19th century, the village is called Majdan, and on maps from before World War I, it is called Majdan Huta. The Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland and Other Slavic Countries, issued in 1900 (volume XV, part I), describes the place as follows: “Huta Stepańska, a settlement, located 82 versts from Rivne. 71 houses, 208 inhabitants”. 
In 1921, when Volhynia was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic, Huta Stepanska was included in the Kostopol county, Volhynian Voivodeship. According to the 1921 Polish census, it had 97 buildings and 539 inhabitants (489 Roman Catholics, 18 Orthodox, 31 Jews and 1 Protestant). In 1922, a Roman Catholic parish was opened there and after 1930 - a health resort, due to rich resources of salt and therapeutic mud, located there. By 1939, Huta Stepanska developed into a major center of northern Volhynia, with more than 200 houses and almost 1000 inhabitants.
World War II.
After combined German and Soviet aggression on Poland, Huta Stepańska, together with whole Volhynian Voivodeship, was annexed by the Soviet Union and was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Many inhabitants of this area were deported by the NKVD to Siberia, majority of those deported were Poles (see: Forced settlements in the Soviet Union). 
In the summer of 1941, following Operation Barbarossa, Volhynia, together with Huta Stepanska, were incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Local Ukrainians started to organize themselves in paramilitary units, also first troops of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army began to appear in the area. 
In late 1942 the UIA started attacking Polish settlements in Volhynia, and in the summer of 1943 the ethnic cleansing became widespread (see: Massacres of Poles in Volhynia). Since Huta Stepańska was a large village, surrounded by a Ukrainian majority, numerous Poles, survivors of the early massacres, gathered there. In the first weeks of summer of 1943, Huta Stepańska became one of the largest centres of Polish defence, with thousands of refugees living there in appalling conditions. Tadeusz Piotrowski estimates that up to 18,000 people found shelter there.
Destruction of the village.
Establishment of the defence center, which was commanded by Captain Władysław Kochański, aka "Bomba" (he had been dropped over Poland in late 1942), and in which there also were Jews, serving in Polish units was soon noticed by the Ukrainians, who decided to destroy it. The attack on Huta Stepanska, preceded by burning fifteen smaller villages in the area, began on July 16, 1943, by troops commanded by Stepan Koval (aka Rubashenko, Burlak), who later said that it was carried out by order of Klym Savur. 
Koval stated after the war: 
"In the summer of 1943, following orders of Klym Savur, I carried out operation of destruction of Polish population in the Rivne district. A UPA unit under my command destroyed villages of Rafałówka and Huta Stepańska, inhabited by the Poles. According to the order of Oleil, commanders of my battalions - Moroz, Bohdan and Rybak, liquidated Polish colonies and people there, such as Marianówka, Wólka Kotowska - Aleksandria and Zofiówka. We had two days and we managed to keep the schedule". 
Huta Stepańska was abandoned and captured by the Ukrainians on July 18, two days after the attack started. Its Polish defenders, realizing that ammunition was in short supply, decided to break out of the encirclement and reach the nearby rail lines. During the evacuation, a panic broke out among Polish civilians, and the Ukrainians took advantage of it, killing from 300 to 600 persons (it is difficult to establish the number of victims). Survivors managed to fight their way through the Ukrainians and reached the railroad junction at the town of Sarny. Most of them were later forcibly taken to Germany, where they had to work for the German war economy as OST-Arbeiters.
Today.
Huta Stepańska does not exist any more. All houses inhabited by the Poles were burned to the ground in 1943, and local Ukrainians stole all possessions, including cattle. What remains is a cross with Polish inscription "Jezu ratuj nas" ("Jesus Save Us", it is a copy of the original, 1943 cross) as well as commemorative stone, placed where once a Roman Catholic church stood, with inscriptions in both Polish and Ukrainian languages.

Giddings Hall, Georgetown College

Giddings Hall, originally called Recitation Hall, is a Greek Revival building located on the campus of Georgetown College in Scott County, Kentucky. Georgetown was the first Baptist college founded west of the Allegheny Mountains, and Giddings Hall was the first permanent structure constructed after the college was formed. The building is named after Rockwood Giddings, the third president of the school. The property was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 6, 1973.
History.
In 1829, the Kentucky Legislature chartered the Kentucky Baptist Education Society with the purpose of establishing a Baptist college in the state. The town of Georgetown was selected for the site of the school because the community agreed to raise $20,000 and to donate the assets of Rittenhouse Academy, a failed land grant school in the town that had recently closed.
In 1839, Rev. Rockwood Giddings became the third president of the college. During his tenure as president, Giddings began construction on Recitation Hall, the first permanent building for the school.
College tradition states that Jonathan E. Farnam, professor of mathematics, drew the original plans for the building, and that architect A.T. Rice drew the final design. A local African-American mason laid the foundation, and a local brickmason named A.L. White built the walls.
The structure is currently used as the main administrative building for the campus. Previously, rooms in the building have been used as a chapel, a library, classrooms, and a theater.
Architecture.
Giddings Hall is a two-story rectangular temple-style Greek Revival brick building situated at a prominent central campus location at the head of Giddings Circle.
The building has four levels, including a stone basement and a deep attic. The brick is laid in Flemish bond on all four sides, and wide pilasters delineate the bays on all facades. The central front facade is a two-story pedimented portico with six brick graduated columns with Ionic capitals. The college's early association with Elijah Craig, who historically is linked to inventing Bourbon whiskey, has fueled a local legend claiming that "a quart of bourbon reposes under each of the six Ionic columns of the portico".
The double windows and Italianate style hoodmolds were added in 1879 when Pawling Hall was constructed.

The Soddered Citizen

The Soddered Citizen is a Caroline era stage play, a city comedy now attributed to John Clavell. The play was lost for three centuries; the sole surviving manuscript was rediscovered and published in the twentieth century.
"The Soddered Citizen" was produced onstage, most likely in 1630, by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register in 1632, but no edition was printed in the seventeenth century. Thereafter the play was thought to be lost; it was known only by its title, and widely attributed to Shackerley Marmion. The manuscript surfaced in 1932, when its owner, Lt. Col. E. G. Troyte-Bullock, brought it to the British Museum for examination. It was studied by scholar John Henry Pyle Pafford and published in 1936.
The manuscript, now kept in the collection of the Wiltshire Record Office, is written in the hand of a professional scribe, and bears notations in five other hands; one of them is the hand of Edward Knight, the prompter and "book-keeper" of the King's Men. John Clavell's signature occurs twice in the manuscript, providing clear clues to the author's identity; it may have been Clavell's personal copy of the work, though the manuscript also shows signs that it went through at least the initial stages of preparation for use as a theatrical promptbook. Notations indicate the identities of some of the actors and their roles in the King's Men's staging.
The play has thirteen speaking parts, four assigned to boy players in female roles. Clavell, the amateur or neophyte dramatist, helpfully loaded his play with copious stage directions — 80 in the text's 2826 lines. The manuscript also contains a list of "dramatis personae", a rare feature in dramatic manuscripts of the era. The actors were:
Additionally, Pollard and Shank doubled small roles, as did Alexander Gough and Anthony Smith. Sharpe spoke the play's Prologue and Epilogue during performances.
The play is set in the milieu of London goldsmiths, with characters named Undermine and Mountain. Its protagonist, Wittworth, is a melancholic whose romantic pursuit of the heroine, Modestina, provides the driving force of the plot. Wittworth's physician, Doctor Makewell, treats him with a radical approach: the delirious Wittworth is led on a pretended passage through Hell, in which Modestina acts the ghost of a love-lorn girl and Makewell is a spell-casting devil at Hell's gates. Wittworth witnesses a masque of seven dancers, "all in Shrowdes," and joins with them to dance in "an antick mockway." Doctor Makewell treats Wittworth with a potion concocted of "an Opiate, of Laudanum, and Diescordium, mixt with Besar stone and Amber."
The Doctor's treatment is successful; Wittworth and Modestina are happily united at the end of the play.

Pavel Yurevich Ruminov (; born 25 November 1974) is a Russian film director. He began his career in Vladivostok directing music videos for Russian acts such as Mumiy Troll and Zemfira before relocating to Moscow. He is best known in Russia for the Internet-based hype surrounding his first feature film "Dead Daughters", where he tried to marry horror and arthouse cinema effectively. The film divided critics in Russia, some praised its style and message, others found the structure of the movie to be very strange. He sold the remake rights for "Dead Daughters" to the Hollywood studio Gold Circle Films but no remake has been produced. His second film "Circumstances", a romantic comedy with dark overtones, was released in Russia in September 2009, but failed at the box-office. In 2012 his third movie "Ya Budu Ryadom" won the gran-prix for the best film at 23rd open film festival Kinotavr, the largest national film festival in Russia. Besides professional cinema, Pavel also makes amateur movies of his family and friends which are available on his website at YouTube.
Ruminov once compared himself favourably to such filmmakers as Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, Jean-Luc Godard, and M. Night Shyamalan. He was the only Russian contributor to Cinema Now, Taschen's 2008 survey of contemporary cinema.

Family Guy (season 2)

The second season of the animated comedy series "Family Guy" aired on Fox from September 23, 1999 to August 1, 2000, and consisted of 21 episodes. The series follows the dysfunctional Griffin family—father Peter, mother Lois, daughter Meg, son Chris, baby Stewie and their anthropomorphic dog Brian, all of whom reside in their hometown of Quahog. The show features the voices of series creator Seth MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Seth Green, Lacey Chabert and later Mila Kunis in the roles of the Griffin family. The executive producers for the first season were David Zuckerman and MacFarlane.
By the end of the second season, due to low ratings, Fox resorted to canceling "Family Guy". However, following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. The series was canceled again in 2002; however, high ratings on Adult Swim and high DVD sales renewed Fox's interest in the series. The series returned for a total of 35 new episodes in 2005.
The season received a favorable reception from critics, who called the series "extremely witty and darkly hilarious," and was "unfortunately" canceled. The Volume One DVD box set was released in Region 1 on April 15, 2003 and Region 2 on November 12, 2001. All twenty-one of the season's episodes are included in the volume. The first season's seven episodes were also included in the volume.
Production.
In 2002, "Family Guy" was canceled after three seasons due to low ratings. The show was first canceled after the 1999–2000 season, but following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. 
During the third season, Fox announced that the show was canceled for good. Fox tried to sell rights for reruns of the show, but it was hard to find networks that were interested; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, " basically for free", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television Production. When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in 2003, "Family Guy" became Adult Swim's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers an episode. Following "Family Guy"s high ratings on Adult Swim, the first season was released on DVD in April 2003. Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies, becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003 and the second highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's "Chappelle's Show". The second season DVD release also sold more than a million copies. The show's popularity in both DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest in it. They ordered 35 new episodes in 2004, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales. Fox president Gail Berman said that it was one of her most difficult decisions to cancel the show, and was therefore happy it would return. The network also began production of a film based on the series.
Reception.
The second season of "Family Guy" received favorable assessments from critics. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk said "Often brilliant, extremely witty and darkly hilarious, "Family Guy" was unfortunately canceled after Fox bumped it around six or seven different time slots. Fans of the show should definitely pick up this terrific sets , while those who haven't seen it should consider giving it a look." Fewer critics responded negatively to the season, including Ken Tucker of "Entertainment Weekly", who graded the series a "D", and named it the worst show of the 1999–2000 television season. Mark Graham noted "MacFarlane's incredibly rocky relationship with both the magazine and its lead television critic, Ken Tucker" in a blog on the "New York" magazine website. Tucker has also criticized the show for perceived anti-Semitism. L. Brent Bozell III expressed in a column of his written in 1999 that he felt that the episode "Holy Crap" promoted anti-Catholicism.
The Parents Television Council, a watchdog and frequent critic of "Family Guy" had initially speculated that "Family Guy" would be "pushing the envelope" before the series' 1999 premiere. In May 2000, in its weekly "E-Alert" email newsletter, the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network to persuade the network to cancel "Family Guy" following a return from a long hiatus in the , due to what the PTC claimed were "strong advertiser resistance and low ratings". In addition, "Family Guy" made the PTC's 2000 "worst prime-time shows for family viewing".
DVD release.
The first and second seasons were released under the title Family Guy Volume One; this standard four-disc DVD box set debuted in Region 1 on April 15, 2003, three months before the premiere of the third season. Distributed by 20th Century Fox Television, it included several DVD extras such as episode commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, and online promo spots. The same episodes, without the special features, were released in Region 2 on November 12, 2001 and in Region 4 on October 20, 2003.
