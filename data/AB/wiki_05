Light rail in Canada

In Canada light rail has widespread support, yet there are only a few light rail systems in the country.
Light rail systems by city.
Calgary.
Despite Calgary, Alberta having a relatively low population density, the city's C-Train system has developed into one of the most successful and busiest light rail system in North America with an average of 297,500 boardings per weekday in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to 285,000 for Toronto, Ontario (includes only the streetcar system, not the subway) and 229,200 for Boston, Massachusetts, the largest LRT system in the United States. In North America, only the light rail systems in Vancouver (with approximately 354,000 passengers per day) and Monterrey, Mexico (with approximately 309,200 passengers per day) surpass the Calgary C-Train passenger load. 
The Calgary system was started in 1981 as the result of decisions to avoid building either downtown freeways or a heavy rail system. At that time, Calgary had less than half a million people and was considered too small for rail transit, but when it first opened the C-Train carried about 40,000 passengers per day. By 2007, Calgary was twice as big with 1 million people, but the C-Train system was over three times as long and carried over six times as many passengers.
As of 2007 45% of the people working in downtown Calgary took transit to work, and the city's objective was to increase that to 60%. The reason is that Calgary's downtown core covers only , is isolated from the rest of the city by two rivers and a railway line, and was built with relatively narrow streets by North American standards. In the 1960s planners proposed a comprehensive freeway system to improve access, but this was rejected due to intense public opposition. However, subsequent growth exceeded expectations and by 2006, Calgary had become the second largest head office center in Canada after Toronto, with of office space and 120,000 people working in the downtown core. The downtown street system is at maximum capacity and has no room for traffic growth, but the city is confident it can add another 60,000 downtown workers in the next 20 years without making space for more cars. Peak hour travel by LRT is equivalent to the capacity of about 16 free flow traffic lanes and allows the city to have fewer than 0.4 downtown parking places available per worker.
Despite the downtown rush, 25% of the riders during rush hour are counterflow commuters - going out of downtown during the morning and into it during the afternoon. Many of these are students going to educational institutions, who receive deep discounts because they are filling seats that otherwise would be empty, and workers doing crosstown commutes to avoid the lack of freeways. However, as of 2007, the C-Train is suffering growing pains. Because population growth has exceeded expectations and LRT ridership has outpaced population growth, Calgary has had trouble buying enough new LRT vehicles and hiring enough new drivers to meet the demand. As a result, many passengers experience lengthy train waits due to overcrowding.
Despite funding problems resulting from lack of support from the provincial and federal governments, there are two extensions under construction. In November 2007, Calgary City Council approved another two further extensions on the two lines, to be completed by 2012. 
In addition, on November 20, 2007, Council gave final approval for the new West Leg of Calgary's LRT, which would be the system's fourth leg. Construction for the West leg will begin in 2009, with completion expected in 2012. When the new light rail vehicles ordered for the extension are finally delivered, the city will have a total of 223 LRVs.
Besides the ongoing program of extending all station platforms to 100Â m to accommodate four-car trains, transportation planners have identified two additional lines to be constructed within the next 25 years. They are to the North-Central and South-East districts of the city. BRT service is in place along the future North-Central route, and is expected to begin on the South-East route within a year. Calgary will also one day have to place a tunnel in their downtown to accommodate one of these new lines, or a combination of lines, much like Edmonton has already done.
Edmonton.
Edmonton was the first city in North America with a population of less than one million to build a modern light rail system. The route first started construction in 1974, and opened its first segment on April 22, 1978, in time for the 1978 Commonwealth Games. While groundbreaking at the time, in contrast with Calgary the Edmonton Transit System built much of its light rail system underground, which meant that it could not afford to lay as much track to the suburbs. In addition, Edmonton's central business district has less office space and the single line which was built did not reach areas which housed many commuters to downtown. The system is successful by North American standards, with a daily ridership of 93,600 passengers.
The City of Edmonton has focused on LRT expansion plans over the past couple of years, with one new line under construction, plans to extend current lines, and plans to add two additional lines.
Ottawa.
In the 1970s and 1980s Ottawa, Ontario opted for grade-separated busways (the Ottawa Transitway) over light rail on the theory that buses were cheaper. In practice, the capital costs escalated from the original estimate of C$97 million to a final value of C$440 million, a cost overrun of about 450%. This is nearly as high as Calgary's C-Train system, which had a capital cost of C$548 million, is about the same length, and carries more passengers. Unfortunately, the Ottawa Transitway has reached capacity, with over 175 buses per hour on the downtown section, and has no cost-effective way to increase the volume.
In 2001, to supplement its BRT system, Ottawa opened a diesel light rail pilot project, (the O-Train), which was relatively inexpensive to construct (C$21 million), due to its single-track route along a neglected freight-rail right of way and use of diesel multiple units (DMUs) to avoid the cost of building overhead lines along the tracks. O-Train has had some success in attracting new ridership to the system (a few thousand more riders), due to its connection of a south end big box shopping mall (South Keys), through Carleton University to the east-west busway (Ottawa Transitway) near the downtown core of the city.
Ottawa produced plans to expand both the Transitway and to open additional rail routes. The intention of the light rail project was to add to the system, not to replace the existing Transitway. However, in mid-December 2006, the new Ottawa city council voted to cancel the LRT system despite the fact that funding was already in place and contracts were already signed. As of 2008, lawsuits against the city of Ottawa over its canceled light rail system totaled over $280 million. The east-west Confederation Line was approved unanimously by Council on December 19, 2012 with the downtown portion of the project expected to be substantially complete by 2017.
Toronto.
Toronto is the largest city in Canada and employs several forms of transit that may or may not be considered "light rail". 
Streetcar
The legacy streetcar system is still largely in place in the downtown area and is extensive in terms of routes and service intervals. Some lines even tie into integrated subway stations without the need for a transfer, and some traffic signals give priority to streetcars. However, the system as a whole is not normally considered true light rail because the mixed running with surface traffic slows travel considerably. Because of the differences in technology and speed, Canadian transportation planners do not usually classify historic streetcar systems as LRT, although they may technically qualify as such.
Some portions of the system operate in dedicated right of ways that come closer to meeting modern light rail standards. Dedicated rights of way have recently been built for the Spadina, Harbourfront and St. Clair streetcars, while the Queen streetcar has operated in a dedicated right of way on The Queensway since 1957. However, the largest vehicles used are articulated double streetcars which are much smaller than most LRT trains and these use trolley poles rather than pantographs to collect electricity. Streetcar fares must also be paid upon boarding as with a local bus. 
Intermediate Capacity Transit System
The Scarborough RT was a demonstration project for elevated light rail that served as a prototype for Vancouver's SkyTrain and JFK's AirTrain). However, it does not meet the common definition of light rail either since it supplies electricity to the trains using two extra power rails (one at +300 VDC and the other at -300 VDC), uses linear induction motors acting on a metal plate between the tracks for propulsion, requires a fully grade-separated right-of-way, and has large stations that have much more in common with a heavy-rail metro. In Toronto it is mapped as part of the subway system. As a part of the Transit City plan, the line will be converted to operation with overhead power collection and low floor vehicles.
Light Rail
On March 16, 2007, the Toronto Transit Commission announced a 120 Kilometre Light Rail Transit network throughout Toronto's inner suburbs. It is planned to be built to modern LRT standards and be entirely separate from the legacy streetcar network. This will be a 15 year project predicted to have 175 million-users by 2021. The plan has been released and can also be viewed at TransitCity.ca
Vancouver.
SkyTrain is an urban rapid transit system in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia and is the longest automated rapid transit system in the world, It uses fully automated trains running mostly on elevated tracks and has of track. SkyTrain was a showcase for Expo 1986.
In addition to using driverless trains, SkyTrain uses two energized power rails (one at +300 VDC and the other at -300 VDC) rather than overhead wires to supply electricity, making it unsafe to operate in the street or use level crossings. Since it is not conventional light rail it is often called an advanced light rapid transit or light metro system. SkyTrain's newest extension, the Evergreen Line, is also planned to be grade-separated automated light transit. Additional extensions are planned for the Millennium Line mostly underground under Central Broadway to University of British Columbia. There is also preliminary talk about extending the Expo Line (although its routing has not yet been determined).
Proposed light rail systems.
Greater Victoria.
A $950 million Douglas St light rail project has been proposed. It would connect West Shore to downtown Victoria, British Columbia.
Fraser Valley from Surrey to Chilliwack.
100 years ago a Vancouverite could board an electric tram in downtown Vancouver and step off 100 km east in downtown Chilliwack. Friends of Rail for the Valley is a non-profit volunteer organisation lobbying for reactivation of this British Columbia owned historic InterUrban passenger rail service from Chilliwack city centre to Surreys' Scott Road Skytrain station on existing and still active rail lines. The InterUrban would provide service to almost one million and access to the US-Sumas border, six universities with 35,000 student and staff, downtown Abbotsford, (with shuttle to Abbotsford Airport), central Langley, and Surrey with connections to Vancouver, YVR airport, Richmond central, Mission and the West Coast Express. A light rail service for the Fraser Valley would be cheaper and quicker to implement than SkyTrain and the entire proposed InterUrban system could be up and running for approximately the same cost as a few kilometers of SkyTrain.
Hamilton.
Hamilton, Ontario's B-Line route is proposed to run east-west along King and Main streets, with Eastgate Mall and McMaster University as its termini. Currently, as a precursor, Route 10 provides an express service along the future LRT route.
Waterloo Region.
The Waterloo Region, Ontario has approved plans for a light rail transit system from Waterloo to Cambridge, which will be constructed in phases.
The first phase of the LRT system is proposed to run from Conestoga Mall in Waterloo to Fairview Park Mall in Kitchener. Extension to Ainslie Street Terminal in Cambridge will be implemented in the second phase. During the first phase, the Kitchener to Cambridge segment will be operated as adapted BRT. The first phase of the project is to begin construction in 2014 and open in 2017. Currently, the iXpress route, a limited stop express bus service, is operating as a precursor to rapid transit. The Region of Waterloo received funding from the provincial government.
Peel Region.
The cities of Mississauga and Brampton in Ontario are jointly working on a light rail along Hurontario and Main Streets. In the original MoveOntario 2020 plan, only Mississauga is supposed to get the LRT, ending only at Highway 407 (which is the boundary), located in an industrial area and a hydro corridor. Meanwhile, the Brampton segment is originally getting BRT, also ending at Highway 407. 
Mississauga Transit's ridership in 19 Hurontario is large enough to warrant decent LRT ridership. This route is also the fastest-growing bus route in Mississauga and the busiest bus route in the 905 region (suburban Toronto), carrying 28,000 passengers a day. Currently, the combined frequency of Hurontario during peak hours, using Routes 19, 102, and 202, is every 3â4 minutes. Meanwhile, Brampton Transit's 2 Main is also frequent, running every 10 minutes.
As a precursor, MiWay's Route 102 has been launched to run between Shoppers World and City Centre Transit Terminal. By September 2011, Brampton Transit's Main Street ZÃ¼m will run from Sandalwood Parkway to Mississauga City Centre Transit Terminal, replacing and extending MiWay's Route 102. Meanwhile, MiWay's Route 202 is replaced by Route 103, a new express route which offers additional midday and evening services.
A similar line to "Connect 10" ("10" refers to Hurontario and Main Street's now-defunct highway number, which is commonly used in popular vernacular) was proposed in the 1970s by Hubert Wolf, a Regional Councillor representing Port Credit; it was largely ignored.

1860 DruzeâMaronite conflict

The 1860 DruzeâMaronite conflict was the culmination of a peasant uprising, which began in the north of Mount Lebanon as a rebellion of Maronite peasants against their Druze overlords and culminated in a massacre in Damascus. It soon spread to the south of the country where the rebellion changed its character, with Druze turning against the Maronite Christians. Around 20,000 Christians were killed by the Druzes and 380 Christian villages and 560 churches destroyed. The Druzes and Muslims also suffered heavy losses.
Background.
On September 3, 1840, Bashir III the last Prince of State of Lebanon was appointed amir of Mount Lebanon by the Ottoman sultan. Geographically, Emirate of Lebanon represents the central part of present-day Lebanon, which historically has mostly had a Christian and Druze population. In practice, the terms Lebanon and Mount Lebanon tend to be used interchangeably by historians until the formal establishment of the Mandate.
Bitter conflicts between Christians and Druzes, which had been simmering under Ibrahim Pasha's rule, resurfaced under the new Prince. Hence, the sultan deposed Bashir III, Bashir II cousin on January 13, 1842, and appointed Umar Pasha as governor of Mount Lebanon. This appointment, however, created more problems than it solved. Representatives of the European powers proposed to the sultan that Lebanon be partitioned into Christian and Druze sections. On December 7, 1842, the sultan adopted the proposal and asked As'ad Pasha al-Azm, the governor of Damascus, to divide the region, then known as "State of Lebanon", into two districts: a northern district under a Christian deputy governor and a southern district under a Druze deputy governor. this arrangement came to be known as the Double Qaimaqamate. Both officials were to be responsible to the governor of Sidon, who resided in Beirut. The Beirut-Damascus highway was the dividing line between the two districts. 
This partition of Lebanon proved to be a mistake. Nurtured by outside powers, animosities between the religious sects increased. The French, for example, supported the Christians, while the British supported the Druzes, and the Ottomans fomented strife to increase their control on the divided State. Not surprisingly, these tensions led to conflict between Christians and Druzes as early as May 1845. Consequently, the European powers requested that the Ottoman sultan establish order in Lebanon, and he attempted to do so by establishing a new council in each of the districts. Composed of members of the various religious communities, these councils were intended to assist the deputy governor.
Peasant uprising in Keserwan.
This system failed to keep order when the peasants of Keserwan, overburdened by heavy taxes, rebelled against the feudal practices that prevailed in Lebanon. In 1858 Tanyus Shahin, a Maronite peasant leader, demanded that the feudal class abolish its privileges. The demand refused, the peasants began to prepare for a revolt. In January 1859, an armed uprising headed by Shahin flared up. The uprising targeted the shaykhs of Mount Lebanon, pillaging their land and burning their homes. Having driven the Maronite feudal lords out of Kesruan and seizing their land and property, the insurgent peasants set up their own rule.
The Keserwan uprising, as it became known, had a revolutionary effect on other regions in Lebanon. The disturbances spread to Latakia and to central Lebanon. Maronite peasants, actively supported by their clergy, began to prepare for an armed uprising against their Druze masters. In turn, the Druze lords began to arm the Druze irregulars.
1860 Druze-Maronite massacre.
Tensions escalated when the Maronite Patriarch of the time, Patriarch Paul Peter Massad, threatened the Druze Prince Mustapha that he would displace all the Druze in the Lebanon with 300,000 men that he had assembled.
Allegedly, the war began with dispute between two children from Deir el Qamar, one Druze and the other Maronite, which spread from their families to their communities. Thus sparked, a torrent of violence swept through Lebanon. In a mere three days, from May 29 to 31, 1860, 60 villages were destroyed in the vicinity of Beirut. 33 Christians and 48 Druzes were killed. By June the disturbances had spread to the âmixedâ neighbourhoods of southern Lebanon and Anti Lebanon, to Saida, Hasbaya, Rasheiya, Deir el Qamar and ZahlÃ©. The Druze peasants laid siege to Catholic monasteries and missions, burnt them and killed the monks. 
In July 1860, fighting spilled over into Damascus. With the connivance of the military authorities and Turkish soldiers, Druze and Sunni Muslim paramilitary groups organised pogroms which lasted three days (July 9â11). 25,000 Christians were killed, including the American and Dutch consuls. Churches and missionary schools were set on fire. Many Christians were saved through the intervention of the Muslim Algerian exile Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers, who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the Citadel of Damascus. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including a number of churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbours.
Most sources put the figure of those killed between 7,000 and 11,000, with some claiming over 20,000. A letter in the English "Daily News" in July 1860 states that between 7,000 and 8,000 had been murdered; 5,000 widowed and 16,000 orphaned. James Lewis Farley, in a letter, speaks of 326 villages, 560 churches, 28 colleges, 42 convents, and 9 other religious establishments, having been totally destroyed. Churchill puts the figures at 11,000 murdered, 100,000 refugees, 20,000 widows and orphans, 3,000 habitations burnt to the ground, and 4,000 perishing from destitution. Other estimates claim 380 Christian villages were destroyed.
International intervention.
The bloody events led France to intervene and stop the massacre after Ottoman troops had been aiding Islamic forces by either direct support or by disarming Christian forces. France, led by Napoleon III, recalled its ancient role as protector of Christians in the Ottoman Empire which was established in a treaty in 1523. Following the massacre and an international outcry, the Ottoman Empire agreed on 3 August 1860 to the dispatch of up to 12,000 European soldiers to reestablish order. Syrian region was then part of the Ottoman Empire. This agreement was further formalized in a convention on 5 September 1860 with Austria, Great Britain, France, Prussia and Russia. France was to supply half of that number, and other countries were to send supplementary forces as needed.
General Beaufort d'Hautpoul was put in charge of the expeditionary force. d'Hautpoul was quite experienced and knowledgeable of matters in the Middle East, as he had served during the 1830s as chief of staff for Ibrahim Pasha in the Egyptian campaigns in Southern Syria. The French expeditionary corps of 6,000 soldiers, mainly from ChÃ¢lons-sur-Marne, landed in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860. 
Beaufort had instructions to collaborate with the Ottoman authorities in reestablishing order, and especially to maintain contact with the Ottoman minister Fuad Pasha. Although the troubles had already been quelled by the Ottoman Empire, the French expeditionary corps remained in Syria from August 1860 to June 1861. This was longer than the initially agreed period of 6 months.
The prolonged French presence in Syria was soon objected to by the British government, who argued that pacification should be left to Ottoman authorities. 
An important consequence of the French expedition was the establishment of the autonomy of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate from Ottoman Syria, with the nomination by the Sultan of an Armenian Christian Governor from Constantinople named Daud Pasha on 9 June 1861.
The French intervention has been described as one of the first humanitarian interventions.

Ben Barba

Benjamin 'Ben' Barba (born 13 June 1989), born in Darwin, Northern Territory, is an Indigenous Australian professional rugby league player who plays fullback in the National Rugby League (NRL) for Brisbane team, Brisbane Broncos. In September, 2008, Barba was named in the Toyota Cup "Team of the Year". The previous season, playing for the Bulldogs in the Jersey Flegg competition, Barba scored 130 points in 11 games. In 2009, Barba was an integral member of the Bankstown City Bulls team that won the New South Wales Cup.
Barba made his NRL debut for the Bulldogs on 28 July 2008, against the St. George Illawarra Dragons. At the time he was called up to first-grade, Barba was working at a car wash. It was announced on 20 July 2011 that Barba had signed a contract extension at the Bulldogs until the end of the 2015 season.
Barba had a successful 2011 season and scored 23 tries from 24 games. Barba's form has been so impressive it earned him a selection into the 25-man Queensland State of Origin squad, however Barba did not make his origin debut.
Background.
An Aborigine and Torres Strait Islander, At a young age Ben and his family moved from Darwin in the Northern Territory to Mackay in Queensland. During his time in Queensland he played all of his junior Rugby League for the Northern Suburbs Rugby League Football Club.
Playing career.
He signed with the Bulldogs in 2007 and joined the Bulldogs in the middle of the 2007 season. At his first season at Belmore, he didn't play First Grade, he played the remainder of the 2007 season in the Under 21s, where he had a good first season, scoring a lot of tries. In his second season at the Bulldogs in 2008, he played most of the season in the Toyota Cup Under 20s competition, where he was playing magic Rugby League. Barba was scoring tries left, right and centre. He scored 26 tries in 27 games in the to Toyota cup competition in 2008. His performances, try scoring ability and attacking flair caught the eye of the Canterbury Bankstown supporters. All the supporters strongly believed that he will be a future star and fan favourite and he should be put into the First Grade side and he would be able to help them win some games and avoid the wooden spoon. But Canterbury coach, former club player and Australian international Steve Folkes stated that he was still too young and it would be a couple of years till he would become a First Grader. As the season went on, Canterbury kept on losing games and were possibly going to cop the Wooden Spoon and the fans kept on urging that Barba be put into First Grade. He made his First Grade debut for Canterbury in Round 20 of 2008, the same week that Sonny Bill Williams quit the club, where they were heavily beaten by the St. George Illawarra Dragons 30-0 at ANZ Stadium. He played three more games for Canterbury in 2008 but resulted in losses against the Wests Tigers at ANZ Stadium 56-4 in Round 21. A 36-12 loss to the other desperate team close to winning the Wooden Spoon the North Queensland Cowboys at Suncorp Stadium with Barba scoring his first ever First Grade try for the club in Round 22 and Round 23 in Canterbury's 52-16 loss against the Penrith Panthers at CUA Stadium. At the end of 2008, he played four games and scored 1 try.
2009.
Barba started the 2009 season in First Grade under new Coach, former Canterbury player and the son of former Great and famous CEO Peter "Bullfrog" Moore, Kevin Moore. He came on as a substitute in Round 1 in Canterbury's 34-12 win over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. That game was the game that Former NSW City, NSW State of Origin player and Former Lebanese and Australian International and Club Great Hazem El Masri became Australian Rugby League's top Point Scorer. Ben played the next couple of games in First Grade in Round 2 Canterbury's 28-26 win against the Penrith Panthers at CUA Stadium and Round 3 in Canterbury's 20-12 loss against the Gold Coast Titans at Skilled Stadium. Then after the loss he got into an incident with Canterbury team mate Jamal Idris. After the incident he was dropped into second grade and played many games and scored tries for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs reserve grade side. He returned to first grade in Round 18 in Canterbury's lucky 18-14 win against the New Zealand Warriors over in Auckland. That game was a memorable one for Barba and for the Club. The Bulldogs were down 14-12 with a couple of minutes to go, then the Dogs made a break and Barba received a pass of Ben Roberts then stepped and dived over for the winning Try. Barba eventually played the rest of the 2009 season in Reserve Grade. He played in Canterbury's 2009 NSW Cup Reserve Grade Grand Final and Premiership win over the Balmain Ryde Eastwood Tigers 32-0 where he had a Magic game where he scored a Hat Trick 3 Tries. At the end of 2009 he played only 4 Games and scoring only 1 Try like in 2008.
2010.
Barba started the new decade, season 2010 in First Grade. He played in Round 1 in Canterbury's 20-16 loss against the Newcastle Knights coming on as a substitute. The next week he scored his first Try of the season in the Bulldogs 26-6 loss against that year's Premiers St. George Illawarra Dragons at WIN Stadium. The next week Barba came on as a Substitute and scored a Hat Trick 3 Tries in Canterbury's charging 60-14 massacre over the Sydney Roosters at ANZ Stadium. After that match he was given the tag "The X-Factor" and became a regular First Grader. In Round 4 he scored 1 try in Canturbury's 38-16 loss to the South Sydney Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium. In Round 5 he scored a sensational try when halftime was approaching in Canturbury's heartbreaking try on full-time 30-24 loss to the New Zealand Warriors at ANZ Stadium. In Round 7 he scored a great Try against the Brisbane Broncos at ANZ Stadium where Canterbury won 36-18. In Round 11 he started for the first time in the season at Halfback in Canterbury's 31-16 loss against the Penrith Panthers at CUA Stadium. In Round 15 Barba came on as a substitute, he scored 2 Tries and almost won Canterbury the game in their 25-24 loss to the Gold Coast Titans at Suncorp Stadium. In Round 16 he filled in the Five-Eighth position and scored 1 try in Canterbury's 18-10 win against the Canberra Raiders at Canberra Stadium. In Round 17 he scored 2 Tries in Canterbury's 24-12 win over the Cronulla Sharks at Bluetongue Stadium in Gosford . In Round 20 he scored 1 try in Canterbury's 32-16 loss against the Parramatta Eels at ANZ Stadium in Bulldogs veteran halfback Brett Kimmorley 300th first grade game. In Round 22 he scored 1 try in Canterbury's 30-6 loss against the Newcastle Knights at Ausgrid Stadium.

At the end of 2010 he played 21 Games scoring 15 Tries.
2011.
At the beginning of 2011 Barba made his representative debut for the Indigenous All Stars in the 2011 All Stars Match where he scored his first ever representative try in that match where they lost to the NRL All Stars 28-12. With the departure of former Canterbury and NSW Country fullback Luke Patten to English club The Salford City Reds, Barba became the Bulldogs new fullback. He played well in Canterbury's 24-14 win over the Wests Tigers in Round 1. Barba scored his first 2 tries of the season in Round 3 in Canterbury's 24-20 win over Eastern Suburbs at ANZ Stadium.

Nariman Printer

Nariman Abarbad Printer (fl. c. 1940) was an Indian amateur radio operator known for setting up the Congress Radio.
With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the British cancelled the issue of new licences. All amateur radio operators were sent written orders hand over their transmitting equipment to the police, both for possible use in the war effort and to prevent the stations from being surreptitiously used by Axis collaborators and spies. With the Indian independence movement gaining momentum, Printer, in 1940 set up the Azad Hind Radio to broadcast Gandhian protest music and uncensored economic news. He was promptly arrested and his equipmient seized. In August 1942, after Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, the British began clamping down on Indian freedom fighters and censoring the media. To circumvent media restrictions, Indian National Congress activists, led by Usha Mehta contacted Mumbai-based amateur radio operators, "Bob" Tanna (VU2LK) and Printer to help broadcast messages to grass-root party workers across the country. This became known as the "Congress Radio", and began broadcasting from 2 September 1942 on 7.12Â MHz. The station could be received as far as Japanese occupied Burma. By November 1942, Printer was caught and decided to help the British.
He is remembered for his call sign VU2FU.

Criser High School

Criser High School was an all-black school accommodating grades 1-12 constructed in 1959 in the Northern Virginia town of Front Royal, Virginia. Its opening occurred the same year 22 black students integrated the all-white Warren County High School which drew national media attention.
After the Stanley plan, the legislative package implementing the massive resistance policies of Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr., was found to be unconstitutional by federal courts, Criser High School was built to prevent total integration of Warren County High School. Its first and only principal, James W. McClendon came to Front Royal from Farmville, Va. McClendon was previously a teacher of agriculture at the R.R. Moton School in Prince Edward County, Va., but had to find work elsewhere when the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors closed the entire county school system as part of its refusal to integrate.
Located on the south side of Front Royal in the town's predominantly black neighborhood, Criser High School provided education for African American students from the surrounding communities of Bentonville, Limeton, Guard Hill, Milldale, Bayard, Reliance, Riverton, Rockland and Happy Creek. With an initial student population of 300 plus, African American instructors from various historically black colleges were recruited to make up its competent corps of teachers. Some of the initial high school instructors came from the Prince Edward County School system.
Criser reached its zenith in the early sixties and it was these formative years of the band that music instructor Geraldine Jackson established the foundation of its music legacy. Appearing on Ted Mack's nationally known The Original Amateur Hour, she showed her proficiency playing the baritone horn. Later, it was under the direction of music instructor John Easley, from Langston University, that the Black and Gold Lancers became marching band favorites of the Annual Apple Blossom Festival, Front Royal Christmas Parade, and the Hagerstown Halloween Parade. Frank Threatts of Richmond inaugurated and coached the school's sports program. In 1962, McKinley Armstrong significantly expanded the program to include baseball along with track and field competition. Criser competed with other historically black Virginia high schools in a local district that comprised Douglas of Winchester, Johnson-Williams of Berryville, West Luray, and Lucy Simms of Harrisonburg. Beyond their district, their competition included Douglass of Leesburg, W.C. Taylor of Warrenton, George Washington Carver of Culpeper, Luther P. Jackson of Merrifield, Hoffman-Boston of Arlington, Booker T. Washington of Staunton, Central Augusta of Staunton, and Jennie Dean of Manassas.
The consolidation of both Warren and Rappahannock school systems introduced black students from Huntly, Flint Hill, Little Washington, and Sperryville to its school population but still the overall student enrollment continued to decline. The school closed its doors in 1966 due to further declining enrollment as a major exodus of students opted to attend Warren County High School in search of a purported better education and to fulfill a driving need to satisfy the wishes of Front Royal's integrationist constituency.
Today the school still stands and has since been renamed Ressie Jeffries Elementary School by the Warren County School Board. Ressie Jeffries, Front Royal's educational black matriarch, was the town's most notable educator. Prior to the construction of Criser High School she was principal at the only elementary school for blacks. This elementary school, located on Criser Road as well, presently serves as one of the administrative offices for the school board. For those African Americans that attended this school and lived during its operation, it is the original Ressie Jeffries Elementary School.

Tosan tank

The Tosan (Also written Towan, meaning Wild Horse or Fury) is an Iranian light tank, for unconventional warfare. Production started in 1997, but the tank was only produced in small numbers. Mass production started in 2008. Colonel Nasser Arab-Beigi, head of the self-sufficiency unit of the IRGC ground forces, announced the mass-production of this 'Quick Reaction' tank on June 30, 2008, as part of the country's campaign for defense self-sufficiency. Iran calls it a 'Quick Reaction' tank because the tank is said to be capable of rapid response and is built for strategic missions. It appears to be based on the British FV101 Scorpion (where Iran has 80 in service), the tank is fitted with a 90 mm gun, Toophan missile launchers and an improved firing and targeting systems. The tank can drive long distances on its tracks and does not need to be carried on trucks.

Tory Mason

Tory Mason (also known as Adrian) is an American pornographic actor (porn star) who has appeared in gay pornography; both in pornographic films and online at commercial amateur porn websites. Born in Idaho, he lived in Belgium for five years as a child. He entered college in Chicago for one semester immediately after graduation from high school and has since transferred to Los Angeles where he now lives and is continuing his college education.
Career.
Mason started his career in February 2006 with some amateur shots that were posted on sites such as DudesNude.com. Those pictures resulted in appearances at online amateur websites operated by producers Corbin Fisher and Boys First Time; he appeared at CockyBoys.com before becoming an exclusive model to RandyBlue.com for nine months which concluded in May 2007.
With his film career, he starred in the debut film for Fierce Dog Productions, "The Bottoming Desire". After filming "Desire", Mason was referred to "FabScout" to represent him in the adult movie business; he has since done additional movies and online appearances. He has also had multiple dancing/stripping engagements across the United States, including appearing at Southern Decadence 2006. In July 2006, Mason had plans for a movie with Studio 2000 to include a scene with Barrett Long and Jake Havoc, followed by working with Chi Chi LaRue, and a film for Titan Men. All three movies came out before the summer of 2007 and have launched Tory's career.
Mason is usually cast in the role of a bottom because of his height and twink appearance, although he's been described as having "some toughness" and "a little bit of a leer", rendering him "foxy cute". Mason claims to be versatile in his private life and is trying to change his look to avoid automatic twink typecasting. He credits his physique to having been a track and gymnastics athlete during his middle and high school years and continuing to run for exercise. In his Yahoo! Group, Mason has announced that he will be gaining approximately 20 pounds throughout the summer of 2007 to relaunch a newer, more athletic image.

European Movement UK

The European Movement UK is an independent pressure group in the United Kingdom which campaigns in support of greater European integration and for reform of the European Union. It is part of the European Movement International. 
The current President of the European Movement UK is the Rt Hon Charles Kennedy MP and the current chairman is Petros Fassoulas. The organisation promotes a 'more democratic, effective and accountable' EU. 
History.
The origins of the European Movement lie in the aftermath of the Second World War. More than eight hundred delegates from across Europe gathered in The Hague in May 1948, under the chairmanship of Sir Winston Churchill, to create a new international movement to promote European unity and prevent further wars between its members. The British section of the European Movement was founded a year later. 
In the 1950s and 1960s, the European Movement put forward the arguments for the United Kingdom joining the European Economic Community, and campaigned in support of membership in the 1970s. During the UK's European Communities membership referendum in 1975, the organisation was involved within the 'Yes' campaign. 
Other campaigns since then have included pressing for direct elections to the European Parliament in the 1970s and promoting the benefits of the single market in the run-up to 1992.

Sellinger School of Business and Management

</table>
The The Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management is the business school of Loyola University Maryland (formerly Loyola College in Maryland) and is located on the college's main campus in Baltimore, Maryland. Formally established in 1980, the business school was named in honor of Loyola's late president Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J., although the university has been offering courses in business for over 70 years. The Sellinger School consists of seven academic departments: Accounting, Economics, Finance, Information Systems/ Operations Management, Management/ International Business, Marketing, and Law & Social Responsibility. The Sellinger School of Business and Management is one of Loyola's three schools, the other two being the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education.
Timeline.
Loyola College first offered courses in accounting and business administration at the undergraduate level in 1937. The baccalaureate degree in business administration was first awarded in 1943 with the accounting major added shortly thereafter. Loyola introduced the Executive MBA program in 1973, the first of its kind in the Baltimore-Washington area and one of the first ten Executive MBA programs in the country. Loyola established the School of Business and Management in 1980 to provide strategic management for business programs. In 1984, the business school was formally named The Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management in honor of the late Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger. In 1985, the Sellinger School initiated the Fellows MBA program to serve rising young executives. In 1988, the Sellinger School earned accreditation in all programs by AACSB (The International Association for Management Education). In early 2000, the Sellinger School moved into a new state-of-the-art facility constructed on the north side of the academic quadrangle.
Jesuit Education.
Loyola University Maryland is a Jesuit Catholic university committed to the educational and spiritual traditions of the Society of Jesus and to the ideals of liberal education and the development of the whole person. Accordingly, the College will inspire students to learn, lead and serve in a diverse and changing world.
In this mission the hallmarks of a Jesuit education are clearly evident: a commitment to the rich tradition of Catholic education, an emphasis on academic excellence, the importance of the liberal arts, and the education of the whole person. At Loyola, this means that the curriculum is rigorous and faculty expectations are high. All undergraduates complete the core curriculum that includes courses in English, philosophy, theology, ethics, history, fine arts, foreign language, mathematics, science, and social sciences. Students are challenged to understand the ethical dimensions of personal and professional life and to examine their own values, attitudes, and beliefs. The College sponsors a variety of programs and opportunities in support of its Jesuit mission; these include the Center for Values and Service, Campus Ministry, and Catholic Studies.
Academics.
The Sellinger School stresses the importance of Experiential Learning, noting that such opportunity serves to enhance traditional classroom work through the integration of theory and practice. Students are offered the chance for enriched academic discussion and a broadened learning environment through Internship, Study Abroad, and Service-Learning Experiences. Two of the three are required for graduation from the Sellinger School.
The college recognizes chapters of Beta Gamma Sigma and Beta Alpha Psi, and affords students international societies such as the Financial Management Association for academic growth and development. The Sellinger Scholars business honors program was developed to prepare highly motivated students for roles of leadership and service in a diverse and changing world. Students are invited to join in their Freshmen year based on academic achievement and must then go through an interview process.
Awards and Distinctions.
Loyola's Sellinger School of Business and Management is the only Baltimore MBA program that has earned accolades from some of the country's most prestigious business publications:
Facility.
The Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J., School of Business and Management Building opened its doors in January 2000. The 50,000-square-foot (4,600 mÂ²) facility features innovative learning space and faculty offices; a five-story glass faÃ§ade; an open atrium; 11 state-of-the-art classrooms; a four-story glass tower; and three seminar rooms.

The Westside Shopping and Leisure Centre, on the outskirts of Bern, Switzerland, is a multi-use facility with shops, restaurants, a swimming pool, conference spaces, residences, a hotel, fitness centres, and a cinema. It was designed by international architect Daniel Libeskind and completed in October 2008.
Design.
Despite its location west of the city, in BrÃ¼nnen-Bern, Westside is urban in scale. According to Studio Daniel Libeskindâs website, the site brings âtogether the dimensions of commerce, culture and leisure." Positioned over a motorway, the centre overlooks an S-Bahn station and acts as a gateway to Bern. The complex is crystalline in structure; a steel concrete skeleton supports the centreâs wood faÃ§ade.
Cuts in the roof bring the changing daylight into the centerâs two plazas. One plaza faces the surrounding BrÃ¼nnen landscape and connects to the centreâs bath, while the other plaza adjoins the hotel and cinema.
Windows tumble across the faÃ§ade, bringing light into the building. This design evokes the erratic matrix of windows across Libeskindâs first major international success, the Jewish Museum Berlin.
Reaction.
Critics, such as David Rogers of the Los Angeles-based Jerde Partnership, have faulted Bern for neglecting to integrate such a shopping centre into the cityâs urban fabric. A shopping centre on the cityâs periphery contributes to the disintegration of the city centre and leads to a âloss of values,â he says.
Defenders of Westside, such as Swiss architect Barbara Holzer, argue that Bernâs urban centre is not under threat and that the shopping centre instead offers ânew urban spaces.â Westside, with its blend of commercial, residential and recreational spaces, exemplifies populist architecture and emphasises public life. Peter Keller, of the ZÃ¼rich newspaper, Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung, adds that the shopping centre suits its surrounding landscape and bears the striking signature of its architect.

Augusto Vandor

Augusto Timoteo Vandor (1923Â â 1969) was an Argentine trade unionist leader, military and politician.
Career.
Vandor was born in Bovril, Entre RÃ­os Province, to a Dutch father and a French mother, in 1923. He enlisted in the Argentine Navy in 1940, and later became an officer aboard the minesweeper ARA "Comodoro Py". He left the Navy in 1950, however, and joined the new Philips factory in the Saavedra section of Buenos Aires. There, he met his future wife, and gained a reputation for strategic thinking that earned him the nickname of "El Lobo" (the Wolf). He became the steward of the Phillips factory UOM local and in 1954, led a strike for better pay at the facility. Its success made him prominent in the UOM (the steelworkers' union within the CGT, the paramount trade union in Argentina), but led to his arrest following a 1955 military coup that overthrew the populist administration of Juan PerÃ³n.
Introduced to the exiled PerÃ³n in Santo Domingo in 1958, Vandor cultivated good relations with amenable figures in management and the military, and on the lifting of government receivership over the CGT in 1961, Vandor was elected Secretary General of the UOM, the largest of the CGT's 62 unions. He represented labor as part of the troika of PerÃ³n's official delegates in Argentina, and as such helped negotiate potential endorsements ahead of the 1963 elections. As the leading CGT political strategist, he was at least as influential in the Peronist movement as CGT Secretary General JosÃ© Alonso, and helped plan "Operation Return," a 1964 mission to slip PerÃ³n into Argentina.
The mission's failure, and Alonso's support for a military coup against President Arturo Illia made opponents of Alonso and Vandor, and the two labor leaders backed opposing candidates in a Mendoza Province gubernatorial race in the 1965 elections. Vandor became increasingly critical of PerÃ³n, in part from a conviction that the aging leader might never return to Argentina. His vocal challenge to PerÃ³n's influence reached a high pitch during the Mendoza campaign, with slogans such as "For a Peronism without PerÃ³n," and "to save PerÃ³n, one has to be against PerÃ³n," and led the exiled leader to send his wife, Isabel, to promote Alonso's candidate. This resulted in the defeat of both Peronist candidates, however, and a conservative candidate was ultimately elected.
Vandor had the CGT leader ousted in February 1966, after which Alonso formed the "62 Organizations Standing with PerÃ³n" faction of the CGT. The military dictatorship installed that June and headed by Gen. Juan Carlos OnganÃ­a lost Alonso's support by the end of 1966, and the two leaders found common cause in both their support for a "participationist" point of view (in favor of negotiations with the regime rather than for headfront opposition), and in their opposition to the more confrontational Raimundo Ongaro. These developments came to a head in March 1968, when Ongaro, head of the Graphists' Union, and Vandor both sought the post of CGT Secretary General. PerÃ³n, wary of Vandor, supported the graphist leader, and Ongaro was elected to the post. The CGT elections were annulled by Labor Minister Rubens San SebastiÃ¡n, however, leading to a temporary schism within the CGT. Vandor thereafter reconciled himself with PerÃ³n, who favored a moderately critical stance towards the junta, opting for the participationist stance.
Augusto Vandor was assassinated on June 30, 1969, at his UOM offices. The attack, for which a far-left Peronist group, the "EjÃ©rcito Nacional Revolucionario" claimed responsibility, remains an unsolved mystery.

Frederick Mitchell Mooers House

The Frederick Mitchell Mooers House, also known as the Wright-Mooers House, is an ornately-detailed Victorian house built in 1894 at 818 South Bonnie Brae Street in the Westlake area of Los Angeles, California. It is named after the wealthy gold miner who owned the house from 1898 to 1900.
The house has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Architecture.
The Victorian era house combines elements of Queen Anne, Richardsonian Romanesque and Moorish Revival architectural styles. 
In their book, "An Architectural Guidebook to Los Angeles," authors David Gebhard and Robert Winter note that the home's overall design is in the Queen Anne style, though are also elements of Richardsonian Romanesque (the two pairs of small columns) and Islamic design (the elongated domed roof) "(Moorish Revival)".
Ownership of the House.
The Wrights and Mooers.
The Mooers House was built in 1894 for May Gertrude Wright and F. L. Wright. However, the Wrights sold the house in 1898 to Frederick M. Mooers (1847â1900) for $5,200. Mooers, known as the "Yellow Aster mining king," was the home's most famous occupant, and the house is commonly known by his name despite his having lived there for less than two years. Mooers came from a wealthy family, but reportedly had an adventurous spirit and spent years prospecting for gold in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona. He moved to Southern California in 1885 and spent years traveling through the Mojave Desert on a burro with a pickaxe and grub-kit searching for his big strike. In 1895, while working with two other prospectors who became his partners, Mooers picked a spot in Randsburg, California that proved to be the site of the Yellow Aster mine, the richest in the area. Mooers became a wealthy man and bought a house in one of the finest neighborhoods in Los Angeles.
Will contest over Frederick Mooers' estate.
The Mooers House and the Mooers entire estate became the subject of a bitter and widely publicized will contest after he died at age 52 in 1900. At the time of his death, Mooers' interest in the Yellow Aster Mining and Milling Company was valued at $755,050; the family house on Bonnie Brae was valued at $10,000. Mooers' wife, who was given only one-sixth of the estate, had not lived with him for 18 years prior to discovery of the Yellow Aster mine. Mrs. Mooers said she had tried living with him over the years, but his alcoholism had caused him to desert his family, leaving her to run a boarding house in New York. On making the big strike in 1895, Mooers wrote asking her to join him in California. Mrs. Mooers came to California and had Mooers deed his interest in the Yellow Aster to her. Mrs. Mooers than granted an option in the property to another, spawning litigation over the mine's ownership. Though Mrs. Mooers had filed for divorce (on grounds of desertion) in 1898, the two remained married, and upon Mooers' death it was revealed that he had recently signed a new will â limiting Mrs. Mooers to one-sixth of the estate and leaving the house on Bonnie Brae to his mother. Prior to his death, Mooers was living at the house on Bonnie Brae with his brothers, and Mrs. Mooers alleged that Mr. Mooers was suffering from severe alcoholism prior to his death and had been coerced by one of his brothers to sign the new will. Mrs. Mooers noted that her husband had been hospitalized for delirium tremens and was not in a proper mental state to sign a new will. The "Los Angeles Times" reported that Mooers was "shattered by drink" and had come under the delusion that his wife was trying to kill him. Mooers' brother, who along with two other brothers and their mother were the principal beneficiaries of Mooers' will, contended that Mrs. Moers had not been "a good and faithful wife" and should receive nothing from the estate. The dispute was settled the day before it was to be tried, after Mrs. Mooers met with her late husband's brother at the family home on Bonnie Brae.
Ownership by Mooers' mother and brothers.
The Mooers House on Bonnie Brae ultimately was conveyed to Mooers' mother, Eliza A.R. Mooers, who lived there until her death in January 1902. The house was then inherited by her surviving sons.
Historic designations.
Though the surrounding neighborhood is no longer an upper class neighborhood as it was at the turn of the 20th Century, the Mooers House and other Victorians in the South Bonnie Brae Historic District have been well preserved. The Mooers House has often been used as an illustration of West Coast Victorian architecture. 
The Mooers House was declared a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #45) in 1967 by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. It was also listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The historic marker at the house calls the home "A Prototype of Distinctive Architecture of the Boom of the 80âs".

David Graham Baird (3 December 1854, New York â 8 October 1913, Elizabeth, New Jersey) was an American chess master. He was the brother of John Washington Baird, who was also an American chess master. A writer in the "New York Times", describing the players in the Sixth American Chess Congress (1889), portrayed Baird and his brother as follows:
Of the Baird brothers, David G. is the better player by far. He plays with characteristic Scotch carefulness, for he is of Scotch descent. Of medium height, he is inclined to stoutness, and is of light complexion. His brother John W. is very thin, although he looks like his brother in the face. He was one of the slowest players in the tournament.
Baird lived in New York, and played in many tournaments there. He won the Manhattan Chess Club Championship four times (1888, 1890, 1891, and 1895).
He also tied for 2nd-4th in 1880, took 2nd in 1883, took 3rd in 1884, took 5th in 1885, took 10th in 1886, took 14th in 1889 (the sixth American Chess Congress, Max Weiss and Mikhail Chigorin won), took 7th in 1893 (Harry Pillsbury won), tied for 10-11th in 1894, took 5th in 1900, tied for 7-8th in 1905, and tied for 11-12th in 1911.

Growling (wind instruments)

Woodwind growling is a musical technique where the instrumentalist vocalizes into the instrument to alter quality of the sound. Growling is used primarily in rock and blues style playing; it is popular in the woodwind family of instruments, especially the saxophone. It is commonly used by mainstream artists such as Ben Webster, Illinois Jacquet and Earl Bostic. Outside of these styles and instruments, it is often considered a novelty effect.
The growl gives the performer's sound a dark, guttural, gritty timbre resulting largely from the rustle noise and desirable consonance and dissonance effects produced. The technique of simultaneous playing a note and singing into an instrument is also known as horn chords or multiphonics.
Method.
The most common and effective method of woodwind growling is to hum, sing, or even scream into the mouthpiece of the instrument. This method introduces interference within the instrument itself, breaking up the normal quality of sound waves produced. Furthermore, the vibration of the vocal note in the mouth and lips creates rustle noise in the instrument.
The vocally produced note can be the same note (though this is believed to be less effective), a natural third or perfect fifth, or any random note, usually from a different octave than the note the instrument is producing. The latter choice is believed to cause the most interference and yield the darkest, grittiest timbre.
Alternate methods.
A woodwind growl can also be produced by allowing air to escape from around the corners of the mouth, causing a vibration in the lips and mouthpiece. Although this method does not set up patterns of interference, it does produce the characteristic rustle noise of the growl.
Alternately, it is possible to use multiphonic fingering to create a growl-like effects. The performer selects a bizarre or unusual fingering that causes the instrument to attempt to sound on multiple notes. This creates interference, but no beating or rustle noise.
Other methods include constricting the airway to create a "rasp".
Use in other instruments.
A "growl" can be produced by instruments outside of the woodwind family such as the trumpet or the trombone. Bubber Miley is often referred to as "growl trumpeter". A "growl trombone" may be seen in a 1929 film "Black and Tan Fantasy" played by Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton.
Harmonica players have started growling as well by using a technique similar to bending notes which causes the reeds to project a raspy gutteral sound.

Edward "Eddie" Davidson (July 29, 1972 â July 24, 2008), also known as "Fast Eddie" and "the Spam King," was an American spammer who from July 5, 2002 through April 15, 2007 conducted a Colorado business using the name Power Promoters. The primary nature of Davidson's business consisted of providing promotional services for companies by sending large volumes of unsolicited commercial electronic messages ("spamming"). The spamming was designed to promote the visibility and sale of products offered by various companies. Davidson utilized the services and assistance of other individuals whom he hired as "sub-contractors" to provide spamming at his direction on behalf of his client companies.
Spamming operations.
Throughout 2002 through the middle of 2005, Davidson's spamming activities were provided on behalf of companies to promote watches, perfume, and other items. Beginning in the middle of 2005 through 2006, Davidson sent spam on behalf of a Texas company for purposes of promoting the sale of the company's stock. The company generated its income through selling low-value stock (commonly referred to as "penny stock") on behalf of small companies on the public market. Davidson, aided by several sub-spammers, sent hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to potential purchasers throughout the United States and the world, which messages touted the penny stock as an excellent investment. Davidson possessed hundreds of thousands of e-mail addresses, which he and his sub-spammers would use to send e-mail messages. Such e-mail messages contained false header information, which concealed the actual sender from the recipient of the e-mail. Davidson provided spammed messages for approximately 19 companies. Davidson operated his spamming activities from his personal residence in Bennett, Colorado, where he had a large network of computers and servers, which facilitated his business.
Court proceedings.
Davidson was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 5, 2007 for violating the CAN SPAM Act. He pled guilty in U.S. District Court before Judge Marcia S. Krieger on December 3, 2007. On April 28, 2008, Davidson was sentenced by Krieger to serve 21 months in federal prison. Judge Krieger also ordered him to pay $714,139 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As part of the restitution, Davis agreed to forfeit property, including gold coins, which he purchased with the proceeds of his activities. At the time of sentencing Judge Krieger ordered Davidson to report to a facility designated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons on May 27, 2008. 
This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Denver field office, and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Neff prosecuted the case.
Incarceration.
Davidson was assigned Inmate Number 35082-013 and housed in a minimum security part of the Florence Federal Correctional Complex in Florence, Colorado.
Escape and death.
Davidson walked away from a federal prison camp in Florence on July 20, 2008. He was subsequently found dead in Arapahoe County, Colorado on the morning of July 24, 2008, after reportedly killing his wife and three-year-old daughter who was strapped to a car seat, in an apparent murder-suicide. His 16-year-old daughter was also shot, but has survived, while his 7 month old son remained unharmed.

Politics of Tuscany

The Politics of Tuscany, Italy, takes place in the framework of a semi-presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of the Region is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Legislative power is vested in the Regional Council of Tuscany, while executive power is exercised by the Regional Government led by the President, who is directly elected by the people. The current Statute, which regulates the functioning of the regional institutions, has been in force since 2005.
Prior to the rise of Fascism, most of the deputies elected in Tuscany were part of the liberal establishment, which governed Italy for decades. The eastern and northern provinces of the region were anyway an early stronghold of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). At the 1924 general election, which opened the way to the Fascist authoritarian rule, Tuscany was one of the few regions which did not return an absolute majority to the National Fascist Party (PNF). After World War II, Tuscany became a stronghold of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which was especially strong in rural areas. 
Traditionally, Tuscany returns big majorities to the left during elections. The PCI and its successors won all the regional and general elections. The region is now a stronghold of the centre-left coalition led by the Democratic Party, which is by far the largest party. The coalition has governed the region since 1995. The current President, Enrico Rossi, has been President since 2010.
Legislative branch.
The Regional Council of Tuscany is composed of 55 members. 34 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 20 councillors (elected in a general ticket) come from a "regional list", including the President-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second.
The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the "simul stabunt, simul cadent" prevision introduced in 1999 (literally "they will stand together or they will fall together"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.
2010â2015 composition.
Source: Regional Council of Tuscany
Executive branch.
The Regional Cabinet ("Giunta Regionale") is presided by the President of the Region ("Presidente della Regione"), who is elected for a five-year term, and is currently composed by 10 members: the President and 9 regional assessors ("Assessori", literally "aldermen"), including a Vice President ("Vice Presidente"), while under-secretaries ("Sottosegretari") help the President but have not right of vote when the cabinet meets.
List of Presidents.
The current President of Tuscany is Enrico Rossi, who is serving his first term after winning the 2010 regional election.
Local government.
Provinces.
Tuscany is divided in ten provinces, which are a traditional form of local administration in the region.
Socialist and communist ideas had an early diffusion in quite all the provinces around World War I. After the Fascist parenthesis, left-wing parties found their strongholds in eastern rural provinces, especially Siena and Arezzo, while Christian Democracy used to be strong in the north-western part of the Region.
The city of Florence is now one of major national strongholds of Democratic Party. The Province of Siena is also called the ""red province of Italy"", because the Italian Communist Party has always governed it with the 60% of the votes since 1945 to its dissolution in 1991.
Municipalities.
Tuscany is also divided in 287 "comuni" (municipalities), which have even more history, having been established in the Middle Ages when they were the main places of government. 13 "comuni" have more than 50,000 inhabitants, of which all but one are ruled by the centre-left.
Parties and elections.
Last regional election.
In the last regional election, which took place on 28â29 March 2010, Enrico Rossi the Democratic Party defeated by a landslide his centre-right opponent Monica Faenzi. The Democrats were by far the largest party, albeit losing ground from previous elections.

<doc id="18568424" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18568424" title="History of Lebanon under Ottoman rule">
History of Lebanon under Ottoman rule

The Ottoman Empire at least nominally ruled Lebanon from its conquest in the sixteenth century until the end of World War I in 1918.
The Ottoman sultan, Salim I (1516â20), invaded Syria and Lebanon in 1516. Salim I, moved by the eloquence of the Lebanese ruler Amir Fakhr ad Din I (1516â44), decided to grant the Lebanese amirs a semiautonomous status. The Ottomans, through the Maans, a great Druze feudal family, and the Shihabs, a Sunni Muslim family that had converted to Christianity, ruled Lebanon until the middle of the nineteenth century. It was during Ottoman rule that the term Greater Syria was coined to designate the approximate area included in present-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine.
Ottoman administration, however, was only effective in urban areas, while most of the country was ruled by tribal chieftains, based largely on their ability to collect taxes for the sultan. The system of administration in Lebanon during this period is best described by the Arabic word "iqta"', which refers to a political system, similar to other feudal societies, composed of autonomous feudal families that were subservient to the emir, who himself was nominally loyal to the sultan; therefore, allegiance depended heavily upon personal loyalty.
It was precisely this power structure, made up of fiefdoms, that allowed Bashir II, an emir from the Shihab dynasty in the Druze and Maronite districts of Mount Lebanon, to become the most powerful figure in Greater Syria during the first part of the 19th century. It was during this period that Lebanon saw increasing class and religious antagonisms that would define Lebanese social and political life for decades to come.
Ottoman conquest and early rule.
The Ottoman sultan, Selim I (1516â20), after defeating the Safavids, conquered the Mamluks of Egypt. His troops, invading Syria, destroyed Mamluk resistance in 1516 at the Battle of Marj Dabiq, north of Aleppo.
During the conflict between the Mamluks and the Ottomans, the amirs of Lebanon linked their fate to that of Ghazali, governor (pasha) of Damascus. He won the confidence of the Ottomans by fighting on their side at Marj Dabaq and, apparently pleased with the behavior of the Lebanese amirs, introduced them to Salim I when he entered Damascus. Salim I, moved by the eloquence of the Lebanese ruler Amir Fakhr ad Din I (1516â44), decided to grant the Lebanese amirs a semiautonomous status.
Bashir II.
The reign of Bashir II saw an economic shift in the mountain regions from a feudal to a cash crop system, in which Beiruti merchants (largely Sunni and Christian) loaned money to peasants, freeing them from dependence on their feudal mountain lords and contributing to the development of a handicraft economy with the growing specialization of agriculture.
The emir's relationship with Muhammad Ali, the Albanian-Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, began in 1821 after Bashir II was forced to seek refuge in Egypt by revolting Maronites upset about overtaxation. In 1822, the emir returned to Lebanon, backed by Muhammad Ali, and reestablished his semi-autonomous rule, making allies with Maronite patriarchs and surrounding himself with Christians, causing many historians to retrospectively accuse the emir of fomenting religious tensions between the ascendant Maronite community and the historically dominant Druze.
Lebanon under Egyptian Occupation.
After the failure to put down the insurrection in some of the Greek provinces of the Ottoman Empire due to the intervention of European powers sinking his naval fleet at the Battle of Navarino, the wÄli of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, sought the province of Syria, which had been promised to him by the Ottoman government if he succeeded in the war. When the Porte refused to give him the province, Muhammad Ali raised an army under his son Ibrahim Pasha to occupy the province and bring it under Egyptian control. Bashir II had sought refuge in Egypt during the aforementioned troubled times in Lebanon from 1821â1822 and had become an ally of Muhammad Ali, thus his help was sought to help secure Egyptian rule in the province. During the occupation, Ibrahim Pasha and Bashir II enacted high taxes, eventually producing resistance, and Bashir IIâs provision of Christian forces in battles against the Druze may have served as a source of future sectarian tensions. Bashir II had previously attempted to not appear as favoring the Maronites to the degree that he was required to under the Egyptian occupation, however as his help was required to hold the territory, Muhammad Ali was insistent that he provide forces to his son, even threatening Bashir II personally when he appeared to be hesitating in bringing his soldiers. The occupation also introduced social measures that raised the legal rights of Christians in the area and imposed conscription and disarmament.
Foreign intervention in the 19th century and changing economic conditions.
The tensions that burst into the sectarian conflict during the 1860s were set within the context of a fast paced change in the established social order in the region. Under Bashir II, the agricultural economy of the Mount Lebanon region was brought into greater interdependence with the commercial economy of Beirut, altering the structure of feudal obligations and expanding the influence of cash crops. This created increased economic and political ties with France, leading to the French becoming an international patron of sorts to the Maronites of Lebanon. This left the British to side with the Druze to the extent that a counterweight to France could be established in the region and that such tensions would not result in separatism that would threaten the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. The reforms within the Tanzimat also provided a source of increasing disagreement between Maronite and Druze populations. The European powers attempted to make sure the Tanzimat was interpreted as a mandate to protected Christians in the region and grant them great autonomy; while Druze elites interpreted the Tanzimat as restoring their traditional rights to rule the land.
Youssef Karam, a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanon's independence during this era.
Religious conflicts.
On September 3, 1840, Bashir III was appointed amir of Mount Lebanon by the Ottoman sultan. Geographically, Mount Lebanon represents the central part of present-day Lebanon, which historically has had a Christian majority. Greater Lebanon, on the other hand, created at the expense of Greater Syria, was formally constituted under the League of Nations mandate granted to France in 1920 and includes the Biqa Valley, Beirut, southern Lebanon (up to the border with modern Israel), and northern Lebanon (up to the border with Syria). In practice, the terms Lebanon and Mount Lebanon tend to be used interchangeably by historians until the formal establishment of the Mandate.
Bitter conflicts between Christians and Druzes, which had been simmering under Ibrahim Pasha's rule, resurfaced under the new amir. Hence, the sultan deposed Bashir III on January 13, 1842, and appointed Umar Pasha as governor of Mount Lebanon. This appointment, however, created more problems than it solved. Representatives of the European powers proposed to the sultan that Lebanon be partitioned into Christian and Druze sections. On December 7, 1842, the sultan adopted the proposal and asked Assad Pasha, the governor (wali) of Beirut, to divide the region, then known as Mount Lebanon, into two districts: a northern district under a Christian deputy governor and a southern district under a Druze deputy governor. this arrangement came to be known as the Double Qaimaqamate. Both officials were to be responsible to the governor of Sidon, who resided in Beirut. The Beirut-Damascus highway was the dividing line between the two districts.
This partition of Lebanon proved to be a mistake. Animosities between the religious sects increased, nurtured by outside powers. The French, for example, supported the Christians, while the British supported the Druzes, and the Ottomans fomented strife to increase their control. Not surprisingly, these tensions led to conflict between Christians and Druzes as early as May 1845. Consequently, the European powers requested that the Ottoman sultan establish order in Lebanon, and he attempted to do so by establishing a majlis (council) in each of the districts. Each majlis was composed of members who represented the different religious communities and was intended to assist the deputy governor.
This system failed to keep order when the peasants of Kasrawan, overburdened by heavy taxes, rebelled against the feudal practices that prevailed in Mount Lebanon. In 1858 Tanyus Shahin, a Maronite peasant leader, demanded that the feudal class abolish its privileges. When this demand was refused, the poor peasants revolted against the shaykhs of Mount Lebanon, pillaging the shaykhs' land and burning their homes.
Foreign interests in Lebanon transformed these basically sociopolitical struggles into bitter religious conflicts, culminating in the 1860 massacre of about 10,000 Maronites, as well as Greek Catholics and Greek Orthodox, by the Druzes. These events offered France the opportunity to intervene; in an attempt to forestall French intervention, the Ottoman government stepped in to restore order. 
On October 5, 1860, an international commission composed of France, Britain, Austria, Prussia, and the Ottoman Empire met to investigate the causes of the events of 1860 and to recommend a new administrative and judicial system for Lebanon that would prevent the recurrence of such events. The commission members agreed that the partition of Mount Lebanon in 1842 between Druzes and Christians had been responsible for the massacre. Hence, in the Statue of 1861 Mount Lebanon was separated from Syria and reunited under a non-Lebanese Christian mutasarrif (governor) appointed by the Ottoman sultan, with the approval of the European powers. The mutasarrif was to be assisted by an administrative council of twelve members from the various religious communities in Lebanon.
Direct Ottoman rule of Lebanon remained in effect until the end of World War I. This period was generally characterized by a laissez-faire policy and corruption. However, a number of governors, such as Daud Pasha and Naum Pasha, ruled the country efficiently and conscientiously. 
Restricted mainly to the mountains by the mutasarrifiyah (district governed by a mutasarrif) arrangement and unable to make a living, many Lebanese Christians emigrated to Egypt and other parts of Africa and to North America, South America, and East Asia. Remittances from these Lebanese emigrants send to their relatives in Lebanon has continued to supplement the Lebanese economy to this day.
In addition to being a center of commercial and religious activity, Lebanon became an intellectual center in the second half of the nineteenth century. Foreign missionaries established schools throughout the country, with Beirut as the center of this renaissance. The American University of Beirut was founded in 1866, followed by the French St. Joseph's University in 1875. An intellectual guild that was formed at the same time gave new life to Arabic literature, which had stagnated under the Ottoman Empire. This new intellectual era was also marked by the appearance of numerous publications and by a highly prolific press.
The period was also marked by increased political activity. The harsh rule of Abdul Hamid II (1876â1909) prompted the Arab nationalists, both Christians and Muslims, in Beirut and Damascus to organize into clandestine political groups and parties. The Lebanese, however, had difficulties in deciding the best political course to advocate. Many Lebanese Christians were apprehensive of Turkish pan-Islamic policies, fearing a repetition of the 1860 massacres. Some, especially the Maronites, began to contemplate secession rather than the reform of the Ottoman Empire. Others, particularly the Greek Orthodox, advocated an independent Syria with Lebanon as a separate province within it, so as to avoid Maronite rule. A number of Lebanese Muslims, on the other hand, sought not to liberalize the Ottoman regime but to maintain it, as Sunni Muslims particularly liked to be identified with the caliphate. The Shias and Druzes, however, fearing minority status in a Turkish state, tended to favor an independent Lebanon or a continuation of the status quo.
Youssef Karam, a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanon's independence during this era.
Originally the Arab reformist groups hoped their nationalist aims would be supported by the Young Turks, who had staged a revolution in 1908-1909. Unfortunately, after seizing power, the Young Turks became increasingly repressive and nationalistic. They abandoned many of their liberal policies because of domestic opposition and Turkey's engagement in foreign wars between 1911 and 1913. Thus, the Arab nationalists could not count on the support of the Young Turks and instead were faced with opposition by the Turkish government.
World War I and the French Mandate.
The outbreak of World War I in August 1914 brought Lebanon further problems, as Turkey allied itself with Germany and Austria-Hungary. The Turkish government abolished Lebanon's semiautonomous status and appointed Jamal Pasha, then minister of the navy, as the commander in chief of the Turkish forces in Syria, with discretionary powers. Known for his harshness, he militarily occupied Lebanon and replaced the Armenian mutasarrif, Ohannes Pasha, with a Turk, Munif Pasha.
In February 1915, frustrated by his unsuccessful attack on the British forces protecting the Suez Canal, Jamal Pasha initiated a blockade of the entire eastern Mediterranean coast to prevent supplies from reaching his enemies and indirectly caused thousands of deaths from widespread famine and plagues. Lebanon suffered as much as, or more than, any other Ottoman province. The blockade deprived the country of its tourists and summer visitors, and remittances from relatives and friends were lost or delayed for months. The Turkish Army cut down trees for wood to fuel trains or for military purposes. In 1916 Turkish authorities publicly executed twenty-one Syrians and Lebanese in Damascus and Beirut, respectively, for alleged anti-Turkish activities. The date, May 6, is commemorated annually in both countries as Martyrs' Day, and the site in Beirut has come to be known as Martyrs' Square.
Relief came, however, in September 1918 when the British general Edmund Allenby and Faysal I, son of Sharif Husayn of Mecca, moved into Palestine with British and Arab forces, thus opening the way for the occupation of Syria and Lebanon. At the San Remo Conference held in Italy in April 1920, the Allies gave France a mandate over Greater Syria. France then appointed General Henri Gouraud to implement the mandate provisions.

Pelorocephalus (meaning "monstrous head" in Greek) is an extinct genus of chigutisaurid temnospondyls from Late Triassic of Argentina. Three species are currently recognized: the type species "C. mendozensis", which was named in 1944, "P. tenax", which was named in 1949 as a species of "Chigutisaurus" and reassigned to "Pelorocephalus" in 1999, and "P. cacheutensis", which was named in 1953 as another species of "Chigutisaurus" and reassigned to "Pelorocephalus" along with "P. tenax". A fourth species, "P. ischigualastensis", was named in 1975 but is based on too little material to distinguish it from other species. The species "P. tunuyanensis" was named in 1948 but has since been synonymized with "P. mendozensis". The largest individuals are estimated to have been over 107 cm in length.

Achaemenid Phoenicia

The Achaemenids ended Babylonian rule in Lebanon, when Cyrus, founder of the Persian Empire, captured Babylon in 539-38 BC and Babylonian province of Phoenicia and its neighbors passed into Persian hands. Cambyses (529-22 BC), Cyrus's son and successor, continued his father's policy of conquest and in 529 BC became suzerain of Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. The Phoenician navy supported Persia during the Greco-Persian War (490-49 BC). But when the Phoenicians were overburdened with heavy tributes imposed by the successors of Darius I (521-485 BC), revolts and rebellions resumed in the Lebanese coastal cities.
The Persian Empire, including the Phoenician province, eventually fell to Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia in 4th century BC.

FertÅrÃ¡kos mithraeum

The FertÅrÃ¡kos Mithraeum is a temple to the Roman god Mithras at FertÅrÃ¡kos in Hungary. The temple (known as a mithraeum), follows a typical plan of a narthex followed by the shrine proper that consists of a sunken central nave with podium benches on either side.
Discovery.
It was discovered by chance by a stonemason called GyÃ¶rgy Malleschitz in 1866 who undertook the initial clearance of the site. It attracted a great deal of interest from local scholars and a restoration of the stone vault of the shrine was funded by a local magistrate (the first attempt at reconstruction at any archaeological site in Hungary). This roof, however, was later demolished and the present cover building erected in the 1990s following the excavations of 1990â1991. The mithraeum is currently open to the public.
The Mithraeum.
Two altars refer to people from Carnuntum and they seem to have been the impetus behind the construction of the temple. Its construction can roughly be dated to the beginning of the 3rd century AD.
Trapeziodal in shape as the north end is wider than the south (5.50 m wide compared to 3.65 m), the shrine is 5.50 m long. It is orientated north to south, with the southern and eastern sides of the shrine both hollowed out of the natural rock and the northern and western sides being built in stone. Four steps lead down into the central aisle (nave) of the shrine which was 80Â cm below the level of the "pronaos" and the two flanking side benches which were all on ground level. The tauroctony sculpture was carved into the rock face.
Three altars (see below) were also found on the site. Two were dedicated by Septimius Justianus, a "custodes armorum" (an soldier in charge of the armoury) of Legio XIIII Gemina. The second was dedicated by Julius Saturninus, a politician from the colony.
The altars.
The following altars were discovered:
"To the god the Invincible Sun Mithras. Lucius Avitus Maturus, decurion of the colony of Carnuntum, willingly deservedly happily fulfilled his vow."
"To Invincible Sun Mithras. Septimius Iustinianus, armorum custos of the 14th legion Gemina Antoninianus, fulfilled the vow."
"To the Invincible Sun Mithras. Septimius Iustinianus, armorum custos of the 14th legion Gemina Antoninianae, willingly and deservedly fulfilled the vow."
The finds are housed in the museum at Sopron.

Phoenicia under Hellenistic rule

The Persian Empire, including Lebanon, eventually fell to Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia. He attacked Asia Minor, defeated the Persian troops in 333 BC, and advanced toward the Lebanese coast. Initially the Phoenician cities made no attempt to resist, and they recognized his suzerainty. However, when Alexander tried to offer a sacrifice to Melqart, Tyre's god, the city resisted. Alexander besieged Tyre in retaliation in early 332 BC. After seven months of resistance, the city fell, and its people were sold into slavery (See Siege of Tyre (332 BC)). Despite his early death in 323 BC, Alexander's conquest of the eastern Mediterranean Basin left a Greek imprint on the area. The Phoenicians, being a cosmopolitan people amenable to outside influences, adopted aspects of Greek civilization with ease.
The Seleucid Dynasty.
After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his Macedonian generals. The eastern partâPhoenicia, Asia Minor, northern Syria, and Mesopotamia--fell to Seleucus I, founder of the Seleucid dynasty. The southern part of Syria and Egypt fell to Ptolemy, and the European part, including Macedonia, to Antigonus I. This settlement, however, failed to bring peace because Seleucus I and Ptolemy clashed repeatedly in the course of their ambitious efforts to share in Phoenician prosperity. A final victory of the Seleucids ended a forty-year period of conflict (See Syrian Wars) . 
The last century of Seleucid rule was marked by disorder and dynastic struggles. These ended in 64 BC, when the Roman general Pompey added Syria and Lebanon to the Roman Empire.

Bezirksliga Main-Hessen

The Bezirksliga Main-Hessen was the highest association football league in the German state of Hesse and the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau from 1927 to 1933. The league was disbanded with the rise of the Nazis to power in 1933.
Overview.
The league was formed in 1927, from the clubs of the "Bezirksliga Main" and the clubs of the north-eastern part of the "Bezirksliga Rheinhessen-Saar". The clubs from the "Bezirksliga Rheinhessen-Saar" which did not become part of the new league were added to the new "Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar" instead. With the Viktoria Aschaffenburg, the league also included one club from Bavaria.
The league operated from the start in two regional divisions, the "Main-division", named after the river Main and the "Hessen-division", named after the region of Hesse. The first played with twelve, the second with ten clubs in its first season 1927-28. The clubs in each division played each other in a home-and-away round with the division winners advancing to the Southern German championship, which in turn was a qualification tournament for the German championship. A "Bezirksliga" final was not played.
The second and third placed team in each division qualified for another round, the "Bezirksliga" runners-up round, to determined one more team which would gain entry to the German finals.
The leagues were reduced to ten teams in the "Main" division and nine in the "Hessen" division in the following season but remained unchanged in modus otherwise. For the 1929-30 season, both divisions then operated on a strength of eight teams, a system that also applied in the following season.
In the 1931-32 season, both divisions expanded in strength, "Main" to eleven and "Hessen" to ten teams. The Southern German finals were also reorganised with the top two teams from each division advancing to the "Northwest" finals group.
In its last season, 1932â33, both divisions operated on a strength of ten clubs.
With the rise of the Nazis to power, the "Gauligas" were introduced as the highest football leagues in Germany. In the region, the "Gauliga SÃ¼dwest/Mainhessen" replaced the "Bezirksliga Main-Hessen" as the highest level of play. The clubs from the Hanau and Friedberg region however were added to the new "Gauliga Hessen".

Phoenicia under Roman rule

The History of Lebanon under Roman rule relates to the Roman control of actual Lebanon, that lasted from 64 BC to the Arab invasions.
History.
[[File:Dioecesis Orientis 400 AD.png|thumb|left|250px|The Roman Diocese of Oriens
in 400 AD, with the two provinces of Phoenice Prima and Phoenice Libanensis]]
The last century of Seleucid rule in Lebanon was marked by disorder and dynastic struggles. These ended in 64 BC, when the Roman general Pompey added Seleucid Syria and Lebanon to the Roman Empire. 
Economic and intellectual activities flourished in Lebanon during the Pax Romana. The inhabitants of the principal Phoenician cities of Byblos, Sidon, and Tyre were granted Roman citizenship. These cities were centers of the pottery, glass, and purple dye industries; their harbors also served as warehouses for products imported from Syria, Persia, and India. They exported cedar, perfume, jewelry, wine, and fruit to Rome. 
Economic prosperity led to a revival in construction and urban development; temples and palaces were built throughout the country, as well as paved roads that linked the main cities like Baalbeck and Berytus. Indeed starting in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE (reign of Augustus) and over a period of two centuries (reign of Philip the Arab), the Romans built a huge temple complex in Baalbek on a pre-existing tell dating to the PPNB, consisting of three temples: Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus. On a nearby hill, they built a fourth temple dedicated to Mercury.
Phoenician Semites would ascend to the throne of Rome during the Severan dynasty. The city of Baalbeck (then called Heliopolis) was made a "colonia" by Septimius Severus (193-211) in 193 AD, having been part of the territory of Berytus on the Phoenician coast since 15 BC. Work on the religious complex there lasted over a century and a half and was never completed. The dedication of the present temple ruins, the largest religious building in the entire Roman empire, dates from the reign of Septimus Severus, whose coins first show the two temples. The great courts of approach were not finished before the reigns of Caracalla (211-217 CE) and Philip the Arab (244-249 CE). In commemoration of the dedication of the new sanctuaries, Severus conferred the rights of the "ius Italicum" on the city.Today, only six Corinthian columns remain standing of this huge Jupiter temple. 
Severus also separated the area of modern Lebanon and parts of Syria from the greater province of Syria Coele, and formed the new province of Phoenice.
Furthermore the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus (actual Beirut): the fifth Macedonian and the third Gallic. The city quickly became Romanized. Large public buildings and monuments were erected and Berytus enjoyed full status as a part of the empire.
Under the Romans, Berytus was enriched by the dynasty of Herod the Great, and was made a "colonia", "Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus", in 14 BC. Beirut's school of law was widely known at the time. Two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught at the law school under the Severan emperors. When Justinian assembled his "Pandects" in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws were derived from these two jurists, and Justinian recognized the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire in 533 AD.
Upon the death of Theodosius I in AD 395, the empire was divided in two: the eastern or Byzantine part with its capital at Constantinople, and the western part with its capital at Ravenna. Under the Byzantine Empire, intellectual and economic activities in Beirut, Tyre, and Sidon continued to flourish for more than a century. 
However, in the sixth century a series of earthquakes demolished the temples of Baalbek and destroyed the city of Beirut, leveling its famous law school and killing nearly 30,000 inhabitants. To these natural disasters were added the abuses and corruptions prevailing at that time in the empire. Heavy tributes and religious dissension produced disorder and confusion. Furthermore, the ecumenical councils of the fifth and sixth centuries AD were unsuccessful in settling religious disagreements. 
This turbulent period weakened the empire and made it easy prey to the newly converted Muslim Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula.
Roman Temples in Lebanon.
Actually, one of the best examples of Roman Temples can be seen in Lebanon. The ruins of Baalbeck are worldwide reminiscence of Roman arquitecture at its best.
The Roman temple sites in Lebanon can be divided into three main groups. First, there is the group in the Bekaa valley north of the Beyrut-Damascus road. Second, there is the group in the area south of the same road, including the Wadi al-Taym and the western flank of Mount Hermon. Third, the group in the area west of a line drawn along the ridge of Mount Lebanon. But in the coastal area of actual Lebanon there are not many ruins from the Roman Empire.
Agrippa greatly favoured the city of Berytus, and adorned it with a splendid theatre and amphitheatre, beside baths and porticoes, inaugurating them with games and spectacles of every kind, including shows of gladiators. But now only minor ruins remains, in front of the Catholic Cathedral of Beyrut.
In two hundred and fifty years - from Augustus to Philip the Arab - were made all the Roman Temples, with a very similar design: they show the golden era of Roman rule in Lebanon.

To these natural disasters were added the abuses and corruptions prevailing at that time in the empire. Heavy tributes and religious dissension between Chalcedonians and Monophysites produced disorder and confusion. In addition, a long period of Sassanid Persian occupation in the early decades of the 7th century temporarily detached the area from Roman control. Although the Byzantines re-established themselves in the region, their hold was shaky, and they soon lost their Middle Eastern provinces to the Muslim conquests.

Politics of Friuli-Venezia Giulia

The Politics of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.
Executive.
The Regional Government ("Giunta Regionale") is presided by the President of the Region ("Presidente della Regione"), who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed by the President and the Ministers ("Assessori"), who are currently 10, including a Vice President.
Legislative branch.
The Regional Council of Friuli-Venezia Giulia ("Consiglio Regionale della Friuli-Venezia Giulia") is composed of 60 members and is elected with proportional representation plus a majority premium for the winning coalition. The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the "simul stabunt vel simul cadent" prevision (introduced in 2003), also the Council will be dissolved and there will be a fresh election.
Parties and elections.
Last regional election.
In the last regional election, which took place on 21â22 April 2013, Debora Serracchiani of the Democratic Party narrowly defeated incumbent President Renzo Tondo of The People of Freedom. Serracchiani was the second woman to hold the office after Alessandra Guerra in 1994â1995.

Woodlawn Farm (Slate Hill, New York)

Woodlawn Farm, sometimes known as the Wood Homestead, is located on Mount Orange Road, a short distance north of Slate Hill, New York, United States. It is centered by a three-section farmhouse whose materials date to the mid-18th century, making it one of the oldest buildings in the Town of Wawayanda. In 2008 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
It has undergone extensive renovation and reconstruction since its original construction, some incorporating elements of architectural styles of the later 19th century. Its residents, many of whom lived in the house for years, have primarily been from two different families, including the descendants of the original builder. Many have also been active in local affairs and served in political office. Woodlawn Farm has thus played an important role in the history of Slate Hill.
Property.
The main farmhouse is a combination of three structures erected during different eras. The main (west) block, closest to the road, is a two-and-a-half-story three-by-two-bay gable-roofed clapboard-sided unit with wraparound veranda on the south and west sides. All the windows have louvered shutters, with those on the main block larger than the other two sections. The roof has patterned cement-asbestos shingles and a brick chimney.
The center and east sections are smaller two-by-two-bay two-story buildings with rolled asphalt roofs, progressively lower in height. Another chimney rises from the east block, currently used as a kitchen. A chimney on the center block has been largely dismantled.
Inside, the main block has a side-hall, double-parlor plan, suggesting it was built as the Federal style was becoming popular in the late 18th century. Some of the decorative touches, such as woodwork and door paneling, are in keeping with the Greek Revival era and an extensive renovation around that time. In the center section, believed to be the oldest, the two open areas and cooking fireplace are consistent with the late 18th century. A library and bay window were added during the 19th century. Its upper story is used for bedrooms.
The east block, the smallest and newest, serves as the kitchen with a large brick mass separating it from the cooking areas in the center block. Its upper story is unfinished.
Two outbuildings are considered contributing resources to the farm's historic character. A large barn with gabled roof is to the north, near the carport, and a frame privy with gabled, asphalt-shingled roof, four-paneled door and novelty siding.
History.
Local lore dates the building's center block to 1765, when Benjamin Whitaker owned what was then a property but the hand-hewn timbers visible in the basement, and the finishes used are not consistent with that period. They, and the overall plan, are more suggestive of a circa-1790 construction date. Richard Wood, the first known occupant of the house, did not settle it until 1772. His house was used for early meetings of the nearby Primitive Baptist Church of Brookfield until the church that still bears that name was built in 1792. The main block was probably added around this time.
While the house itself may not be as old as believed, some of its materials may. In 2002, during the most recent renovation of the house, notched hand-hewn timbers were found beneath the center-block bathroom floor that are more extensively used in houses on Long Island from that era. They appear to have been reused from a previously-built home. No record or other trace exists of any earlier building on or near the site.
From Wood, the house became the property of Festus Webb, a local official, in 1796. He would reside there for the next forty years, during which the Greek Revival aspects of the main block were added. Roswell Mead, who bought it from Webb's estate, lived there until his death in 1850, serving as town supervisor, New York State Assemblyman, and town justice during his residency. His wife and son sold the property to William Wood, Richard's grandson, in 1867.
Like his predecessors, Wood would own the house for over two decades, and distinguish himself in local politics as a supervisor, a position he held for 14 years. It is likely that he put the east wing on the house, due to the Italianate touches on it. He built the current barn in 1888 when the original one burned down. He also branched out from farming into industry, damming a nearby stream to create the now-drained Crescent Lake. He built a gristmill, ice house and the Springbrook Hat Factory, using wild teasel from his fields to card the wool. None of these buildings remain, but their existence is attested by period photographs.
He transferred the property to his daughter Minnie in 1900. Under her ownership, the property became more valuable as real estate than as farmland. She subdivided it into 18 lots, reducing the family plot to today's around the house and fronting on the road. Her son LeRoy inherited it when she died in 1945, then sold it to Dr. Frank Myers Jr. a year later.
Myers, who lived at Woodlawn until 1986, was also active in community affairs. He chaired the Department of Medicine at Middletown's Horton Memorial Hospital for 22 years, serving for part of that time as chief of staff, while maintaining his local practice. He was the town's health officer, and also played a part in establishing the Minisink Valley Central School District. His son and daughter-in-law have lived there since then.
Aesthetics.
The original blocks of the Woodlawn Farm house are representative of English colonial building traditions of the mid-18th century. The center block's two-by-two-bay shape is common among older houses in Orange County built by settlers of English descent, especially in the Town of Montgomery. Most were expanded with only one wing, or with an additional bay or two. The two separate blocks added on and heavily modified in later eras represent a distinctive record of the changes in architectural taste among the region's prosperous landowners.

Racing in the Street

"Racing in the Street" is a song by Bruce Springsteen from his 1978 album "Darkness on the Edge of Town". In the original vinyl format, it was the last song of side one of the album. The song has been called Springsteen's best song by several commentators, including the authors of "The New Rolling Stone Album Guide".
Structure.
The song is a near-dirge-like ballad that begins with a slow, graceful and elegant introduction by pianist Roy Bittan. 
The narrator has a dead end job, but his pride and joy is his '69 Chevy that he and his partner built, and race across the northeast United States to win money gambling against similar racers. The first verse is accompanied only by piano and opens with the narrator singing that:
Max Weinberg's drum rim taps signal a somewhat faster pace for the second verse. Midway through, Danny Federici's organ later joins in, combining to form what writer Robert Santelli termed "one beautiful, seamless sound". The organ entrance signals one of the lyric's main points, that the narrator divides the world into two types of people: those who "give up living / And start dying little by little, piece by piece," and those like himself who find something to live for, which in his case is going racing in the streets. 
However, after an instrumental break the third verse unexpectedly takes place with again only piano behind it. The girlfriend the protagonist apparently won from a competitor in one of his races does not share his dream of going racing in the streets. Instead, she "stares into the night with the eyes of one who hates for just being born." But the story ends on a possibly hopeful note, as the narrator attempts to find salvation in the closing lines:
Other views of the closing have been grimmer. In any case, the song concludes with a moving fugue-like instrumental coda with Bittan's piano, Federici's organ and Max Weinberg's drums intertwining.
The chord progression in the choruses and coda is IâIVâVIâIV in the key of F. Springsteen uses the technique of withholding the V chord, which is only heard during the piano introduction and during a later transition; by reducing the chord's influence, the sense of longing or desperation in the song is heightened.
"Racing in the Street" contains two clear homages: the title and chorus refer to Martha and the Vandellas' 1964 hit "Dancing in the Street", while the instrumental break after the second verse and chorus is an allusion to The Beach Boys' 1964 song "Don't Worry Baby", itself about the emotional aspects of drag racing. The song also inhabits the space established by other early 1960s works, such as Jan and Dean's "Dead Man's Curve" and various other Beach Boys works. Indeed, writer Jim Cullen sees as one of Springsteen's goals with the song to comment upon and reconnect certain elements of rock history. Structurally, the song is also influenced by Van Morrison's "Tupelo Honey".
Themes and interpretations.
Springsteen has said that this song commemorates the racing in the street that occurred on a little fire road outside his home base of Asbury Park, New Jersey. But the song is one of a number of Springsteen songs from the 1970s, such as "Born to Run" and "Thunder Road", that celebrate American men's desire for freedom from responsibility, as symbolized by the ability to drive to freedom in a fast car. The protagonist of "Racing in the Street" can be contrasted with the protagonist of Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car". The protagonist of "Racing in the Street" using his fast car as a means to escape the city and responsibility, while the protagonist of "Fast Car" is using her fast car to approach the city and responsibility. 
In any case, the song plays off the American love of muscle cars during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. Indeed, automotive enthusiasts have debated whether 1969 Chevrolet models could be ordered, customized, or built to the exact specifications given in the song of a 396-cubic-inch Chevrolet big-block engine with fuel injection and Hurst Performance transmission. 
Another interpretation of the song is that it is a possible realization of the potential inherent in "Thunder Road". That song is a declaration of what the protagonist and his girlfriend are going to do; "Racing in the Street" is the reality of how they might end up. Most importantly, "Racing in the Street" is the first song in which Springsteen introduces the suffering woman. Rock has always had songs where women are won and lost as trophies in contests, but Springsteen treats that theme with much more compassion than usual in the genre. This perspective is amplified by writer Jeffrey B. Symynkywicz, who sees the romantic attachment formed in the story removing the protagonist from his perfectly constructed world of cars built to personal specification and no external commitments. Springsteen paints "a harrowing portrait of the toll depression takes" on the woman, but the protagonist is at least mature enough to realize he has to augment the challenges he takes on the street with the role of not letting the woman face her demons alone. While romanticization of the ordinary, anonymous Americans found in "Racing in the Street" is common in rock, Springsteen's detailed depiction of them in this song shows real understanding and compassion, perhaps due to his having lived among them.
Writer Greil Marcus sees "Racing in the Street" as picking up the characters of various Beach Boys songs fifteen years later in their lives, never finding anywhere else the freedom they found in their cars and driving forever towards a dead end that they could see but not wish away or reach. "Rolling Stone"'s David Fricke echoes this view, saying it is "Springsteen's grim "Darkness" portrait of a generation racing to a dead end." Both the album's title track "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "Racing in the Street", which is similarly set physically and which close the two album sides, are influenced by film noir, which further set the mood of the record. Writer Eric Alterman sees "Racing in the Street" as one of Springsteen's top-flight songs, and one of several on the "Darkness" album that helped establish its low-on-hype integrity and power, and thus cemented Springsteen's relationship with his fan base. 
William Gibson, "noir prophet" of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction, said in 2010 that "Racing in the Streets" had everything to do with the hacker Bobby Quine from Gibson's 1982 short story "Burning Chrome" and what he did for a living.
Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh has called the song "the line of demarcation separating casual Springsteen fans from the fanatics," with the former considering it yet another sign of Springsteen's car metaphor obsession taken to an extreme, while the latter consider it "maybe the best thing Springsteen has to give." Detractors have also referred to the song as plodding, especially in comparison to the dynamicism of the prior "Born to Run" album. In any case, the people in "Racing in the Street" are part of the central thematic development of Springsteen's cast of characters from "Born to Run" to "Nebraska" and beyond.
Springsteen has called "Racing in the Street" one of his favorite songs. The song has been highly praised by other artists, including Bob Dylan. It was disc jockey Richard Neer's favorite Springsteen song, and when famed New York station WNEW-FM finally gave up on its rock format in 1999, "Racing in the Street" was the last song Neer played.
Live performance history.
"Racing in the Street" was a regular feature of the set list during Springsteen's 1978 Darkness Tour. This began the practice of the band playing a much longer coda part after the lyrical section concluded. With the music almost gone, Weinberg would start tapping his drumstick, and the band would slowly begin a long instrumental build-up with Bittan's piano leading. Subsequently, guitars enter almost unheard, with soft, high-pitched figures adding overtones against the keyboard parts. Listening to it live and on bootleg recordings of radio broadcasts the following year, writer Greil Marcus said the performance of "Racing in the Street" following the tour's famed elongated presentation of "Prove It All Night" had captivated his attention and was "the only music I've felt scared to play, and scared not to." The 1978 performances of the song typically segued into "Thunder Road".
The song was also a regular during the 1980â1981 River Tour. Now the song was a standalone piece, typically eight minutes in length, with a coda that neither faded out like the studio recording or segued into another song, but rather built to a series of climaxes. A live version of the song from the tour, recorded in 1981 at Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey, was included on the 1986 box set "Live/1975â85". "Rolling Stone" noted that in concert the song "draws its power from a deeper well, palpably accelerating with pensive desperation as Danny Federici's sorrowful organ clouds over Roy Bittan's ballerina piano figure."
During the 1984â1985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour, "Racing in the Street" was first in set list rotation with "Backstreets". Then, once "Rosalita" was dropped as the standard second-half main set closer, "Racing in the Street" often served in its stead for a while, although by the 1985 U.S. stadium leg it was gone. During its time as a set closer, Springsteen began telling a softly spoken story about a summer romance gone bad, set against a wistful synthesizer backdrop by Bittan. Then the song was played, but the coda's ending was routed into Springsteen telling the conclusion of the story, with the couple packing their bags and leaving for an unknown destination, after which Springsteen walked off the stage while the coda resumed for one time around. This version was not included on the "Live/1975â85" set because it had not been performed during any of the shows that were professionally recorded.
The song virtually disappeared from Springsteen's concert repertoire in the following years, appearing just a few times on the 1995â1997 solo Ghost of Tom Joad Tour played on acoustic guitar (and usually accompanied by future E Street Band violinist Soozie Tyrell). 
Beginning in 1999 with the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour and the subsequent 2000s tours in the Reunion Era, "Racing in the Street" appeared intermittently, often rotating with "Backstreets", "Jungleland", and similarly long, intense songs in a late-in-main-set "epic" slot. These versions were often nine minutes long, with audiences cheering in anticipation of the coda. Tyrell's violin and sometimes Clarence Clemons' baritone sax were added to the mix, but the lead was still Bittan, playing coda sequences up to several crescendos, before playing a minor-key line that signalled the conclusion.
During the final Vote for Change concert in 2004, "Racing in the Street" was performed by Springsteen and the band with Jackson Browne sharing the vocals. Springsteen played it a number of times on solo piano during his 2005 Devils & Dust Tour. It returned in its full-band incarnation on subsequent tours beginning in 2007, including a lengthy 2009 version which appears on the DVD "".
Other versions.
In addition to the original, the song has been covered by several artists, including a countrified version by Townes Van Zandt from his 1993 album "Roadsongs". Other artists who have covered the song include Emmylou Harris on her 1982 live album "Last Date" and Queen's Roger Taylor on his 1984 solo album "Strange Frontier". Serena Ryder recorded it in 2009 for use on Springsteen's website, and in the same year, Charlie Robison included the song on his album "Beautiful Day" and a version by The Wave Pictures was used as the opening selection on the Springsteen tribute album "Play Some Pool, Skip Some School, Act Real Cool". In 2010, Justin Townes Earle recorded it as the B-side to the digital single "Christchurch Woman".
Springsteen released his own alternate version on "The Promise", his 2010 double CD of outtakes from "Darkness on the Edge of Town". This version has slightly different lyrics and a more uptempo, anthemic arrangement than the album version. In the opening verse, the protagonist's car is a 1932 Ford instead of a 1969 Chevy. In the final verse, the woman's "pretty dress" is torn, not her "pretty dreams".

Kim Dalton was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Director of Television from 2006 until December 2012 when he announced he would leave the coporation. Before this appointment, Dalton had been chief executive of the Australian Film Commission since 1999.
In 2007 Dalton was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the film and television industry in policy, in assistance to Indigenous producers and in the promotion of emerging visual technology.
In August 2011, the ABC eliminated three television programs and laid off some staff. The Community and Public Sector Union complained about the staff cuts. Dalton said the audience for "Art Nation", one of the eliminated programs, had fallen by 30%. Australian Senator Nick Xenophon initiated an inquiry into the staff and programming cuts. A report from the environment and communications references committee was released on 13 October 2011.
In February 2012, the ABC appointed a new head of arts effective 11 April 2012. Dalton said the new position would report to him, and as "a result of changes to our arts production and line up last year we have increased the resources committed to primetime arts programming to be commissioned from the independent production sector."
In November 2012, ABC Managing Director Mark Scott and Dalton announced the closure of television production facilities in Hobart, making 16 staff members redundant. Tasmanian senator Catryna Bilyk called for further investigation after ABC announced it was cutting the state's TV production unit.

Snowy River Cave

Snowy River Cave is a cave passage within Fort Stanton Cave in Lincoln County, New Mexico, obtaining its name from a stream bed of white calcite.
Geology.
The bed of Snowy River is covered with bright white calcite. Over time, ancient, slow moving ground water dissolved the limestone walls of the cave and, with the help of microorganisms, recrystallized limestone into the white-colored mineral. Since prehistoric times, ground water saturated with dissolved calcite has periodically flooded the cave, followed by extended periods of dryness, leaving behind coatings and deposits.
The Bureau of Land Management reports that Snowy River may be the largest continuous cave formation in America.
Hydrology.
Discovered in 2001, Snowy River is a section of a much larger cave complex. Researchers and explorers have not yet determined how the formations relate to the geology and hydrology. After visits to the dry riverbed in 2001, 2003, 2005, explorers were surprised to find Snowy River flowing with water in 2007 and also in 2010 after a heavy winter snowfall. The non-profit Fort Stanton Cave Study Project group has a long history of work in the cave.
Biology.
From crusts on the cave walls, antibiotic-producing actinobacteria and some 36 strains of manganese-using bacteria have been discovered. New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology says the organisms live in this isolated environment by chemically breaking down manganese compounds, creating reconstituted mineral byproducts in the process that may have pharmaceutical uses. Scientists anticipate new biological as well as geologic discoveries will be found.

Hermann Rothe

Hermann Rothe (December 28, 1882 in Vienna â December 18, 1923 in Vienna) was an Austrian mathematician.
Rothe studied at the University of Vienna and the University of GÃ¶ttingen. He attained the Doctorate in Engineering in 1909 in Vienna. Then he was assistant at the Vienna University of Technology, where he attained the Habilitation in 1910. In 1913 Rothe married and began to teach mathematics at the Vienna University of Technology as Professor extraordinarius, and from 1920 as Professor ordinarius. In 1923 he died after a long disease.
Rothe is known for his collaboration (1910â1912) with Philipp Frank on special relativity. Based on group theory, they tried to derive the Lorentz transformation without the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light.
Furthermore Rothe worked â outside his teaching activity â on mathematical problems like Hermann Grassmann's "Ausdehnungslehre" (theory of extension, or exterior algebra).

While in the set position, American sprinter Torri Edwards twitched before the gun, and apparently anticipated a recall; however, there was no recall gun, and Edwards finished last. After the race, US Track & Field officials appealed for a recall, claiming that Edwards had false started, but the appeal was rejected and the result stood. Despite Edward's assertions, she actually had a reaction time of 0.179 seconds, which was not the fastest or the slowest of the eight runners. It is possible, therefore, that when she twitched, Edwards had not applied enough pressure on the blocks to trigger a warning, or she might have twitched her upper body but left her feet solid."

Battle of Intramuros

The Battle of Intramuros is the rivalry between Colegio de San Juan de Letran Knights and MapÃºa Institute of Technology Cardinals; both are walking distance from each other at Manila's Intramuros district. The rivalry is played at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines).
The rivalry is notable in which even though Letran performs better in league competition, they have never swept the elimination round meetings against their neighbors in recent years.
The Battle of Intramuros may also refer to the "original" rivalry between University of the Philippines Manila (UP) and Ateneo de Manila in which first began on 1915 when UP and Ateneo played basketball games on Intramuros. Eventually the rivalry died down and was revived when both schools competed in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines and is now called the "Battle of Katipunan" from the avenue that connects Ateneo's new campus at Quezon City and University of the Philippines Diliman (The Manila university stopped sponsoring collegiate athletics after World War II.)
Another "Battle of Intramuros", though not as prominent as the one between Letran and MapÃºa, was formed when Lyceum of the Philippines University, another Intramuros-based institution sandwiched between Letran's and MapÃºa's campuses, joined the NCAA as a guest team in 2011 and was advertised as such whenever the Pirates play either the Knights or the Cardinals. However, due to Lyceum's status as a guest team, it is not considered a rivalry for now.
Men's basketball results.
Both teams are guaranteed to face each other at the elimination round (regular season) twice, while they can meet for a maximum of three times in the playoffs.Mapua leads the eliminations 21-13 over Letran

Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics â Men's 200 metres

The Men's 200 metres at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on 18â20 August at the Beijing National Stadium.
The qualifying standards were 20.59 s (A standard) and 20.75 s (B standard).
Usain Bolt set a new world record of 19.30Â s in the medal race and won by the largest margin of victory (0.52Â s; after disqualifications 0.64Â s) in an Olympic 200 m (Walter Tewksbury had a ca. 0.6 seconds margin in his victory in the first Olympic 200 m race in 1900). 
Controversy arose within minutes after the medal race when Wallace Spearmon, who finished third in 19.95Â s was disqualified for stepping out of his lane. United States officials filed a protest, but conceded after seeing the video and noticing that silver medalist Churandy Martina (19.82Â s) who had celebrated the second ever Olympic medal for the Netherlands Antilles, also may have stepped out of his lane. They filed an appeal to disqualify Martina, which after more than an hour of deliberation was granted, through which the United States obtained both the silver and bronze medals.

The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty

The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty (NLCHP) was founded in 1989 by Maria Foscarinis as a non-profit corporation based in Washington, D.C. It is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal revenue Code, and contributions to it are tax deductible. The organization is governed by a 16 member volunteer Board of Directors, and works with other national and local organizations across the country.
The mission of NLCHP is to prevent and end homelessness by serving as the legal arm of the nationwide movement to end homelessness. Through a combination of impact litigation, policy advocacy, and public education, NLCHP works for systematic reform that addresses the causes of homelessness at the local, state, and national level. NLCHP views homelessness as an extreme form of poverty, caused primarily by a shortage of affordable housing, insufficient income, and inadequate social services. NLCHP is the only national legal advocacy organization dedicated solely to preventing and ending homelessness.
NLCHPâs programs focus on reforming systems that contribute to and cause homelessness, while also working to make a concrete difference in the lives of millions.
The organizationâs programs include:
Accomplishments.
Major accomplishments by NLCHP include:
Pro bono.
Many of NLCHP's most significant and high profile legal victories were made possible through extensive pro bono service from the private bar. In 2004, NLCHP decided to strengthen its ties with pro bono partners and recognize their vital contributions to its work. Thus, the Lawyersâ Executive Advisory Partners, known as LEAP, was formed. LEAP is a national philanthropic effort of the legal community to help homeless and poverty-stricken Americans achieve self-sufficiency. LEAP members work to prevent and end homelessness by providing NLCHP with financial support as well as pro bono legal services. The members form a network of key influential leaders that realize significant positive social change.
History/Founder- Maria Foscarinis.
In 1989 by Maria Foscarinis created theNLCHP. She is a lawyer who has been working to end homelessness on the national level. *Before founding this organization, Maria Foscarinis was a former litigation associate at Sullivan and Cromwell. Through her pro bono work at Sullivan and Cromwell, she became an advocate for the homeless *[http://www.law.stanford.edu/display/images/dynamic/events_media/LEAP%20description%20with%20members%20on%20letterhead.pdf. She has worked on Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. This act was the first major federal legislation that addresses homelessness and poverty on a national level. *[http://www.nlchp.org/staff_project.cfm]

They also work with victims of domestic violence who are at risk of losing their homes due to what has happened to them. 
Income
The NLCP focuses on improving benefits in income for homeless persons. This includes Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and the food assistance programs. They advocate for an increase in funding for these programs. 
Children and youth
There are more than 1.3 million children are homeless. They work to strengthen legislation that will guarantee all children especially children who are homeless an education. They believe that education is one way to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness. 
Human rights
About half of Americans believe that adequate housing is a human right. This advocates for an increase in housing resources at all levels of government
Hurricane Katrrina
The NLCHP has immediate, intermediate, and long-term plans to help the people affected by both hurricanes Katrina and Rita. They assist in two ways. They assist those who lost their housing to the hurricanes and those who were homeless before the hurricanes. They work with the national response that meets the needs of the people who are affected. 
Membership-LEAP.
Membership is used through the Lawyers' Executive Advisory Partners (LEAP) Program. *Members of LEAP members provide financial support and pro bono legal services to help the NLCHP prevent. *[http://www.law.stanford.edu/display/images/dynamic/events_media/LEAP%20description%20with%20members%20on%20letterhead.pdf Pro-bono is when someone donates professional and legal work for the public good *[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pro%20bono].

Long-term solutions of homelessness.
There long-term solutions for homelessness include ensuring affordable housing, ensuring adequate income, ensuring social services, and to prohibit discrimination. They believe by providing real solutions they will be able to help integrate the homeless back into society. They will do this by lobbying and creating policies. One example of this is that they are creating policies that will help the homeless jobs that will then help them find homes which will help stabilize the economy. 
McKinney-Vento Awards.
Every year the NLCHP holds the McKinney-Vento Awards. These awards recognizes individuals and organizations that have helped provide solutions to end homelessness and poverty. 2011 marked the 13th annual Mckinney-Vento Awards.*The McKinney-Vento awards is named after Congressman Stewart B. McKinney and Congressman Bruce F. Vento. *[http://nlchp.org/2011MVDetails.cfm#AboutTheAwards.

Zinovii Shulman

Zinovii P. Shulman (23 February 1924 in Ptich, Homiel Voblast â 4 February 2007 in Minsk, Belarus) was a Belarusian hydrodynamics scientist, former chief research worker of the state research institute A. V. Luikov Heat and Mass Transfer Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, and a doctor of technical sciences.
Early life and education.
Born in Ptich, Shulman spent his childhood in a small township near the Ptich railway station in Gomel Province. Later, his family moved to Gomel, where attended high school in preparation for tertiary studies.
When the Second World War broke out, like several of his fellow male students, Shulman joined to defend his country. His bravery, courage, and valour were marked with high battle service decorations, including the Order of Glory and Order of the Patriotic War.
In 1947, after his military discharge and without passing high-school equivalency exams, Shulman matriculated to the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute, where he was taught by the physicist Abram Ioffe.
Career.
As an engineer in aerohydrodynamics, Shulman worked on an assignment at a major industrial design office in the city of Syzran where he worked to create new equipment products. While working as part of a large team, Shulman took an active part in scientific innovation. He organized several scientific cells at the plant, published his first research paper in the journal Energomachinostroyeniye and made inventions. One of his early proposals was of quite fundamental nature: a split wheel for a water turbine. In 1957, Shulman returned to his native Belarus, where he was employed by the Institute of Power Engineering of the BSSR Academy of Sciences. There he continued his scientific development, acquiring, accumulating and, what is more important, creating new knowledge.
In 1963, a new scientific school investigation of the flow and heat and mass transfer in rheologically complex media began to develop at the Heat and Mass Transfer Institute (HMTI)] on the initiative of academician A. V. Luikov, member of the BSSR Academy of Sciences, and Shulman. As early as 1966 the pioneering monograph "Boundary layer of Non-Newtonian Fluids" by Shulman and Berkovsky was published. In it, the authors generalized their own theoretical developments and descriptions of convective processes of heat and momentum transfer in external flow of nonlinear-viscous fluids past bodies of various geometry. Subsequent results of the new theoretical and experimental investigations were reflected in Shulmanâs work "Convective Heat and Mass Transfer of Rheologically Complex Fluids" (Moscow: Energia, 1975) and in a large series of publications for the Rheophysics Laboratory in authoritative domestic and foreign publications. The monograph gave an explanation of the phenomenon discovered by Luikov, Shulman and Puris. During the same years, Puris and Shulman discovered rubber mechanical behavior of gases in high-intensity rotating flows with considerable rates of shear deformations in the interdisk gap with eccentricity.
The generalized law of nonlinear-viscous flow (1966) formulated by Shulman and his followers is widely used in the scientific world. Based on this law, six monographs have been written and various investigations have been actively conducted.
A fundamental study of the electric rheological effect (ERE) was started in 1966 and that of the magnetic rheological effect (MRE) began the following year. The results led to new theories and also to more than 170 engineering applications: among them robots, manipulators, machine-tools, electro-acoustic equipment and micromachines. A large series of investigations on the said subject is reflected in articles, papers and monographs written personally or in co-authorship.
In the years before his death, Shulman worked a lot and achieved success in the field of biomedical problems and, in particular, the rheology of blood. This included the description and modeling of thermal processes in controlled hyperthermia and hypothermia and also in photodynamic therapy.
Honours.
Honored worker of science of the Republic of Belarus, Shulman is considered a pioneer in ERE and MRE. In 1982, based on the results of the all-union contest, he was mentioned among the five best inventors of the USSR. In 1997 he was awarded the annual G. V. Vinogradov Prize of the Rheological Society of the C.I.S. He was honored as a scientist and awarded decorations by foreign universities (Sheffield, Warsaw, Seoul, and Krakow). Twenty-nine doctoral dissertations and those of 108 candidates have been prepared under his supervision.

The Women's 400 metres at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on 16â19 August at the Beijing National Stadium.
The qualifying standards were 51.55 s (A standard) and 52.35 s (B standard).
Favourites for the event included Sanya Richards-Ross and the reigning world champion, Christine Ohuruogu. In the final, Richards-Ross made a rapid start and quickly took the lead, while Ohuruogu ran a more even-paced race, but was well down the field entering the final straight. However in the last 100 metres Richard-Ross, clearly tired from her earlier effort, began to tie up badly, while Ohuruogu began to surge through the field. At the line, Great Britain's Christine Ohuruogu won in 49.62 seconds to add the Olympic title to her World title, just pipping Shericka Williams by 0.07 seconds to take gold. Richards-Ross faded to third, and bronze, in 49.92.

An Outline Dictionary of Maya Glyphs

An Outline Dictionary of Maya Glyphs: With a Concordance and Analysis of Their Relationships is a monograph study of the Maya script by William E. Gates, first published in 1931. The inventory of glyphs used in Gates' analysis was compiled and drawn from the Madrid, Dresden and Paris codices, rather than from monumental inscriptions and stelae. It was published at a time when the Maya script remained wholly undeciphered and the type of writing system the script represented was unknown and much debated among Mayanists. Gates' work represented one of the major attempts in this pre-decipherment era of Mayanist scholarship to catalogue and analyse Maya glyphs as a prelude to uncovering their meaning. In comprehensiveness it was later superseded by GÃ¼nther Zimmermann's "Die Hieroglyphen der Maya-Handschriften" (1956), and then in particular by J. Eric S. Thompson's "A Catalogue of Maya Hieroglyphs" (1962), which became established as the "de facto" standard catalogue and analysis of its day.
Once it was realised in the latter half of the 20th century that the Maya script was largely logosyllabic in nature, Mayanist epigraphers beginning with Yuri Knorozov began a process of breakthroughs in the script's decipherment. Other key contributions and realisationsâsuch as establishing that the stelae texts recorded actual history and real personages and eventsâled to the decipherment of a significant number of glyphs and texts, particularly from the 1970s onwards. While many of the interpretations put forward in the early catalogues by Gates "et al." have been made redundant by the modern knowledge of the script, catalogues such as Gates' have retained their significance and utility as references and recordsâparticularly for calendrical and astronomical data and interpretation.
The original edition was limited to 207 copies. The book was subsequently reprinted by Dover in 1978, and by Kessinger in 2003.

Ma'ayan Baruch

Ma'ayan Baruch (, "lit." Blessed Spring) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located near the intersection of the Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese border, it falls under the jurisdiction of Upper Galilee Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 277.
History.
The kibbutz was founded in March 1947 on the land of Hamara, a moshav abandoned in 1920. The founders were members of other kvutzot who had met in Kfar Giladi; members of the HaTenua HaMeuhedet youth movement, members of Habonim who immigrated to British Mandate of Palestine as Ma'apilim (illegal immigrants of Aliyah Bet), and members of a garin of pioneering soldiers from South Africa who fought in the British Army during World War II.
Development projects.
A new neighborhood in Ma'ayan Baruch was built to attract newcomers and bring money into the kibbutz coffers in the wake of the socio-economic problems that have affected many kibbutzim since the 1980s. The newcomers are from other kibbutzim and townships in the region, as well as other parts of the country. 
Landmarks.
A museum which holds a collection of prehistoric artifacts found in the Hula Valley, The Prehistoric Man Museum, is located on the kibbutz. The museum collection includes the skeleton of a prehistoric woman, approximately 50 years old, buried with her dog.

Tom Kotchman

John Thomas Kotchman (born August 14, 1954 in Grafton, North Dakota) is an American professional baseball scout, coach and minor league manager.
Early baseball career.
Tom Kotchman attended high school in Seminole, Florida, and played baseball at Chipola Junior College in Florida and Georgia Southern University. He was signed by the Cincinnati Reds in 1977 and played two seasons (1977â1978) in their farm system at the Class A level. A third baseman, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .
The 2012 season marked Kotchman's 34th consecutive year as a minor league manager. He began his career in 1979 at age 24 with the Auburn Redstars in the Short-Season Class A New York-Penn League. The Auburn franchise lacked a Player Development Contract and was designated a "co-op" team, receiving its players on loan from multiple Major League organizations. After one season there, Kotchman became manager of teams affiliated with MLB organizations. He spent 1980â1981 in the Detroit Tigers' system, as skipper of the Bristol Tigers of the Rookie-level Appalachian League in 1980, then the Macon Peaches of the full-season Class A South Atlantic League in 1981. He then spent 1982â1983 as pilot of the Boston Red Sox' Class A Florida State League franchise, the Winter Haven Red Sox.
Almost three decades with Angels.
In 1984, he joined the farm system of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (then the California Angels), beginning an association that would last until 2012.
From 1984 to 1986, he was manager of the club's Class A California League farm clubs, the Redwood Pioneers, based in Rohnert Park, California, and the Palm Springs Angels. Success there led to a promotion to the Angels' Triple-A Edmonton Trappers affiliate in the Pacific Coast League, where he also spent three seasons (1987â1989).
In 1990, Kotchman assumed a role he would play for 23 seasons, as both a Florida-based area scout and manager of the Angels' Short-Season Class A or Rookie-level teams in the Northwest League and the Pioneer League. He skippered the Boise Hawks of the NWL for 11 seasons (1990â2000), during which time the Hawks never finished lower than second place and never compiled a losing record. From 2001 to 2012, he managed in the Pioneer League with the Provo Angels (2001â2004) and the Orem Owlz (2005â2012). Through 2012, he had compiled a career managerial record of 1,704 victories and 1,434 defeats, a winning percentage of .543, with eight league championships, including Orem's '09 Pioneer League title. In late October 2012, it was reported that Kotchman and the Angels had severed their longtime relationship, when he was told to concentrate solely on scouting.
Return to Red Sox' system.
The December 11, 2012, edition of "Baseball America" reported that Kotchman had decided to rejoin the Red Sox organization for as a Florida area scout. On December 14, the Red Sox announced that Kotchman would also serve as a coach for the Rookie-level Gulf Coast Red Sox. On December 18, 2013, the Red Sox promoted Kotchman to manager of the GCL Red Soxâhis 35th year as a skipper in minor league baseball.
In 2008 Kotchman was one of the inaugural inductees into the Professional Baseball Scouts Hall of Fame.
Personal.
He is the father of Cleveland Indians first basemen Casey Kotchman and his daughter Christal Kotchman was on the College of Charleston softball team.

Fatos BeÄiraj

Fatos BeÄiraj (Cyrillic: Ð¤Ð°ÑÐ¾Ñ ÐÐµÑÐ¸ÑÐ°Ñ, Albanian: "Fatos Besim Beqiraj"; born 5 May 1988) is a Montenegrin footballer of Albanian ethnicity who plays for Changchun Yatai and the Montenegro national football team.
Club career.
BuduÄnost Podgorica.
He began his career in PeÄ with the local club KF Shqiponja at 17 years of age before joining their city rivals KF Besa in July 2007. After spending the first half of the 2007â08 season with Besa his good performances in the Kosovar Superliga attracted attention from several clubs in the region, and in January 2008 he moved to the Montenegrin side FK BuduÄnost Podgorica.
He immediately established himself as a first team regular at BuduÄnost, scoring 9 goals in 15 appearances in the second half of the 2007â08 season, helping the club win the Montenegrin championship title and finish runners-up in the 2007â08 Montenegrin Cup. In the following two seasons BeÄiraj scored 28 league goals in 62 matches for the club, becoming league top scorer in the 2008â09 season with 18 goals scored.
Dinamo Zagreb.
It was announced on 30 August 2010 that Beqiraj signed for Croatian powerhouse Dinamo Zagreb. Beqiraj played very well in his debut season with Dinamo and became regularly called up to the Montenegro national team. He played in 22 league matches and scored 8 goals, most notably a beautiful goal against NK Rijeka and a fine header against Hajduk Split.
Beqiraj struggled to find his goalscoring form at the beginning of the 2011â12 season, finally scoring after eight matches without a goal, netting the fifth goal in a 5â0 win against NK Karlovac. He then scored the last goal in a 4â1 win against MalmÃ¶ FF in the Champions League Play-off. Beqiraj then continued his goalscoring form in domestic competition, scoring against NK VaraÅ¾din, NK Istra, NK Zadar, NK Å ibenik and RNK Split.
On 22 November 2011, BeÄiraj scored Dinamo's first goal in the 2011-12 Champions League, netting a header in Dinamo's 6-2 away loss to Real Madrid at the Santiago BernabÃ©u.
Beqiraj was the first choice striker throughout the 2011-12 season and became top scorer of the Prva HNL with 15 goals in 28 appearances, becoming the first foreign player to accomplish that feat.
Changchun Yatai.
In February 2014, BeÄiraj transferred to Chinese Super League side Changchun Yatai.
International career.
Beqiraj was first called up for the Montenegro U21 by coach DuÅ¡an VlaisavljeviÄ in 2009, winning his first cap in a 2011 European Under-21 Championship qualifier against Kazakhstan U21 on 7 June 2009. He went on to earn five caps for the U21 team before receiving his first call-up for the senior team in March 2009, for a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Italy. He had his international debut in the match, coming on as a substitute for Radomir ÄaloviÄ in the 70th minute. He scored his first goal for Montenegro on 17 November 2010 in a friendly match against Azerbaijan.
Beqiraj said in an interview that should the Kosovo national football team be allowed to play international events, he would consider leaving the Montenegro team to play for Kosovo.

Red Point is an unincorporated community located just off Maryland Route 272 south of North East, Maryland, USA. It is near Elk Neck State Park, where the North East River enters Chesapeake Bay.
The neighborhood is a mix of seasonal and full-time residents. In the past several years the residents have worked to improve the area, paving and patching streets, renovating existing homes, and even tearing down some older cottages and replacing them with newly constructed homes. Several members of the community have been investing time, effort and money into trying to decrease the erosion of the banks into the Chesapeake Bay. The view is beautiful with seven miles of water to Havre de Grace. Situated on the bay with its private beach, boat ramp and pier provides frequent sightings of Bald Eagles, Osprey and herons feeding on the fish. 
The community association sponsors an annual Fourth of July picnic complete with a pig roast and pot luck lunch. Several residents work together over the winter to construct a quilt that is raffled off at the picnic to raise money for community projects. Many neighborhood vehicles display the oval "RP" (Red Point) stickers as a symbol of pride in the community.

National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis

The National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis (NPAP) is an institution established in New York City by Theodore Reik in 1948, in response to the controversy over lay analysis and the question of the training of psychoanalysts in the States.
Following the lead established by Sigmund Freud, the NPAP offered training to the three core disciplines of medicine, social work and psychology, as well as to graduates from the humanities.
History.
Over the following decades, inevitably dissensions emerged in the organisation, and other non-medical training institutions were set up in America.
Current ideology.
The organisation currently sees itself as a vibrant professional association of analysts representing a diversity of theories that comprise contemporary psychoanalytic inquiry. The NPAP's diverse membership is active in research, publication, legislation, public education, and cultural affairs, thus ensuring a psychoanalytic contribution to the community at large. The NPAP also publishes the highly respected and internationally recognized journal "The Psychoanalytic Review", the oldest continuously published psychoanalytic journal in the United States.
Mindful of a legacy reaching directly back to Freud, the Institute today offers comprehensive psychoanalytic training grounded in the classical tradition, expanded by contemporary insights, and designed to prepare candidates for the professional practice of psychoanalysis.

Jan KlusÃ¡k

Jan KlusÃ¡k (born 18 April 1934 in Prague as Jan Porges) is a contemporary Czech composer, author of film, television and incidental music.
Life.
KlusÃ¡k was born to a Czech Jewish family, who owned the farm in Prague (Prosek). After he graduated from the gymnasium, he pursued his studies at the Prague Music Academy as a pupil of Jaroslav ÅÃ­dkÃ½ and Pavel BoÅkovec (in 1953-57). Later he concentrated solely on composing.
He has never worked directly with music groups or schools, although his style was temporarily influenced by the music of Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky, and later by the Second Viennese School, especially by Alban Berg and Serialism. Since 1959 he cooperated closely with Czech conductor Libor PeÅ¡ek and with "Chamber Philharmony". In the 1960s he occasionally acted in films, such as the 1966 film "A Report on the Party and the Guests", in addition to composing the music. However, after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, KlusÃ¡k was condemned as a "politically undesirable" person (he composed music for prohibited films). During the normalization KlusÃ¡k was engaged in the JÃ¡ra Cimrman Theatre, but he was forced to leave in 1975. Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, he began to participate in public life again, and worked as a member and director of various cultural institutions in the Czech republic. He was awarded a ""Classic 1995"" Award for his compositions and for his "String Quartet No. 5" in particular.
Selected works.
In the 1980s KlusÃ¡k focused more on vocal compositions. He began to compose song cycles, cantatas, and wrote an opera.
KlusÃ¡k is also the composer of the music to the popular Czech television series Hospital at the End of the City.

Warhol-o-rama is a book of American poetry that examines the lifeâand robust afterlifeâof the artist Andy Warhol (1928â1987).
A poetic sequence by Peter Oresick, it employs techniques of multiple perspective and Warholian parody and appropriation, often to humorous effect. The sequence draws heavily from source material in the archives of the Andy Warhol Museum as well as a large body of mythology surrounding the pop art icon to render a postmodern serial portrait of Warhol.
The book was published on 6 August 2008, the occasion of Andy Warhol's 80th birthday, by the university press at Carnegie Mellon University, of which Warhol was an alumnus.

Take a Chance (musical)

Take a Chance (1932) is a musical with lyrics by B. G. De Sylva and music by Nacio Herb Brown and Richard A. Whiting, with additional songs by Vincent Youmans, and book by De Sylva and Laurence Schwab.
Background.
"Take a Chance" started as a musical titled "Humpty Dumpty" written by DeSylva and Schwab, which flopped immediately during out-of town tryouts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it had opened on September 26, 1932. The musical was extensively rewritten, and after further tryouts in Philadelphia, Wilmington, Delaware, and Newark, New Jersey, the musical was renamed, and the book, music, and cast had changed, leaving only Ethel Merman. Richard Whiting left, and Vincent Youmans was called in to write additional songs.
Production.
The musical opened on Broadway at the Apollo Theatre on November 26, 1932 and closed on July 1, 1933 after 243 performances. Directed by Edgar MacGregor with choreography by Bobby Connolly, the show starred Ethel Merman as Wanda Brill and featured Jack Haley as Duke Stanley, Jack Whiting as Kenneth Raleigh, June Knight as Toni Ray, and Sid Silvers as Louie Webb. Merman's vocal arrangements were by Roger Edens. Merman introduced the popular hit "Eadie Was a Lady".
Synopsis.
Two small-time gamblers, Duke Stanley and Louie Webb, leave their carnival circuit to seek greater fortunes in the legitimate theater. Their friend Toni Ray wants to be a singer and her Harvard-educated boyfriend, Kenneth Raleigh, also wants to enter show business. They meet a no-nonsense nightclub singer, Wanda Brill. Wanda performs a risque number in a New Orleans club in a red dress and black boa ("Eadie Was a Lady").
1933 Film.
In 1933, the show was made into a film with almost no resemblance to the original show, except for the song "Eadie Was a Lady". Lillian Roth played Merman's role in the film.

Supernatural (season 1)

Season one of "Supernatural", an American television series created by Eric Kripke, premiered on September 13, 2005, and concluded on May 4, 2006 after 22Â episodes. It focuses on the protagonists Sam and Dean Winchester as they track down their father, John, who is on the trail of the demon who killed their mother and Sam's girlfriend. During their travels they use their father's journal to help them carry on the family businessâsaving people and hunting supernatural creatures. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles star as Sam and Dean, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan recurring as their father John and Nicki Aycox as the demonic Meg Masters. This is the only season to air on The WB Television Network, with all subsequent seasons airing on The CW Television Network, a joint venture of The WB and UPN.
The first sixteen episodes of the season aired on Tuesdays at 9:00Â pm ET in the United States, after which the series was rescheduled to Thursdays. Overall, the season averaged about 3.81 million American viewers. The season gained many award nominations, among them two Primetime Emmy Awards for work done on the pilot episode. While some critics did not like the mostly anthology-like format, others praised the show for the emotional moments and noted the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors.
The season was internationally syndicated, airing in the United Kingdom on ITV, in Canada on Citytv, and in Australia on Network Ten. The first season was released on DVD as a six-disc box set on September 5, 2006, by Warner Home Video in RegionÂ 1. Although the season was split into two separate releases in RegionÂ 2, the complete set was released on October 2, 2006, and in RegionÂ 4 on October 2, 2007. The episodes are also available through digital retailers such as Apple's iTunes Store, Microsoft's Xbox Live Marketplace, and Amazon.com's on-demand TV service.

Production.
Writing.
The first season's mythology mainly follows Sam and Dean's search for their missing father. Series creator Eric Kripke summarized this storyline as merely "find Dad", which he deemed "simple", "emotional", and "clean". However, he found the self-enclosed episodesâindependent stories which attain closure at the end of each episode and add little to the overarching storylinesâto be "hit and miss". Because the first ten episodes consist of self-enclosed stories, the series mythology does not begin until the eleventh episode, "Scarecrow". This episode introduces the demon Meg Masters, which executive producer Kim Manners felt was "desperately needed". Though uncertain at exactly what direction to take the character, the writers intended Meg to be an antagonist for the Winchesters throughout her story arc. The series mythology further expands with the addition of the demon-killing Colt handgun near the season's end, lending to the "modern American Western" theme the producers were going for.
Although the weekly adversaries for the Winchesters were often based on urban legends, the writers tried to put their own spin on the stories for each of the episodes. For example, Kripke combined the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization in the pilot. The episode "Hook Man", however, borrowed three or four elements from the numerous variations of the Hook Man legend. The figure is an escaped mental patient in the traditional myth, but the writers decided for the purposes of the show to make him the ghost of a hook-handed killer. They also added a poltergeist element by having him attached to the conflicting emotions of the guest starâshe wears a crucifix made from his melted hook. Rather than focus on modern interpretations, Kripke and co-executive producer John Shiban decided that "Supernatural"s vampires would stem more from the original legends. The vampires were given retractable fangsâthese were inspired by the rowed teeth of sharksâas well as no aversion to sunlight or the crucifix. Kripke personally added the fact that vampires would become weak if given the blood of a dead man.
Other aspects grew out of basic concepts or ideas. For the episode "Skin", writer Shiban felt that the shapeshifting villain had to change into one of the lead characters. The character chosen was Dean, and the writers decided not to clear his name of attempted murder at the end of the episode. Though they at first feared that having one of the main characters be a wanted man would later ruin the show, the writers eventually felt it was "a great layer to add", opening up new potential storylines and characters. Dean's reputation is addressed again in "The Benders", and catches up to him in the second and third seasons. Another element that would influence future episodes came about in "Hook Man" when writers Milbauer and Burton realized that shotguns shoot salt, a weakness for spirits. Kripke deemed it the "perfect combination of occult element", as it brought together a "folkloric repellent of evil" with the "blue-collar aspect of shotguns". The episode "Ayslum" later established iron as another weapon against ghosts. "Faith", on the other hand, stemmed from the question of whether it truly was wrong to heal good people of their illnesses at the cost of the lives of strangers. Kripke noted, "[Layla's] really a great girl and she deserves to live, and some stranger you don't even know will die... and maybe that's worth it." Reapers were not in the original script of the episode, but were added later to give the writers a chance to create "scary" sequences and to explain the faith healer's ability. Because the writers found the traditional look of the Reaperâhooded and carrying a sickleâto be cheesy, they ultimately made him appear as "the most shriveled old man you could ever imagine".
Although the villain of the episode "Hell House" has supernatural origins, the basis of the story came from a situation writer Trey Callaway had as a child; he and his friends created a fake murder scene in an abandoned barn and then convinced their friends that killings occurred there. The children would often go there to scare each other, with one girl running away and breaking her leg after believing that she saw an attacking ghost. The human antagonists of "The Benders", however, were completely devoid of supernatural elements. Shiban made this decision not only to surprise the audience, but also to have the Winchesters face something they had never encountered before. For "Nightmare", Tucker tried to write the character Max as sympathetic, and thus had difficulties in deciding how to end the episode. The writers eventually decided to have him kill himself to prevent him from doing more harm.
Starting off on the series, Kripke excluded vampires due to their affiliation to "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". He wanted "Supernatural" to have its own identity, but became more comfortable with it over time. The writers intended for the vampire-episode "Dead Man's Blood" to be a self-enclosed episode, but Kripke's introduction of the Colt tied it to the final two episodes of the season. This addition pleased the writers of the penultimate episode "Salvation" because the Colt gave the brothers a way to fight Meg and also provided a reason for her to kill the Winchesters' friends. Gamble and Tucker crafted the latter storyline because they felt Kripke would only allow their inclusion if they died. When the writers could not come up with something for the Winchesters to be doing while Meg is on the loose, they split the episode into two stories; John would go after Meg while the brothers protect another family from Azazel. Tucker felt that this opened "all this emotional stuff with the guys", as well as "brought back all the themes of the show and tied the season up into a nice big bow". Similarly, Kripke believed that the revelation of John being possessed by Azazel in "Devil's Trap" had to be, as it completed the two main storylines of the seasonâfinding their father and tracking down the demonâat the same time, but had them find "both" characters in "one" body.
Influences by popular culture.
While supernatural and urban legends inspired many episodes, some storyline aspects were influenced by popular culture. The inspiration for the wendigo's appearance in "Wendigo" came from the creature featured in the music video for the Aphex Twin song "Come to Daddy". Human features were added to the design due the wendigo's human origins, and the creature was given the ability to mimic human voices to create a "creepy effect". However, Kripke was not pleased with the final appearance of the wendigo, deeming him as "Gollum's tall, gangly cousin". Because of this, the creature is not seen throughout most of the episode. For shapeshifting scenes in the episode "Skin", Kripke chose to base the transformation on that of "An American Werewolf in London", using prosthetics and makeup rather than computer-generated imagery. "The Ring"s Samara influenced the titular villain in "Bloody Mary", though Kripke felt that she ended up looking too similar to the character due to her grisly appearance and the use of speed ramping to create a time-manipulation effect. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden, on the other hand, believes it was more of an homage.
Filming.
Though the pilot was shot in Los Angeles, principal filming for the rest of the season took place in Vancouver, British Columbia. Local sites often served as shooting locations, with much of "Dead in the Water" taking place at Buntzen Lake and the climax of "Wendigo" occurring in a Britannia Beach mine. Likewise, Riverview Hospital functioned as a mental institution in "Asylum". Though production has sometimes recycled sets from other television seriesâ"The Benders" made use of a previously-built Western town, while the warehouse-loft set of "Shadow" originated from the series "Tru Calling"âmost episodes usually require the construction of new sets due to the constant change of setting. The production team, however, created reusable standing sets in the form of the motel rooms frequented by the Winchesters. Each episode presents a different theme to disguise the motel-room set's repeated use, with different colors, bedspreads, and curtains being used. The episode "Provenance", for instance, displayed a disco-themed motel room.
Music.
The mostly synthesized orchestral score of the season was composed by Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska. The pair try to base the music on the visuals of each episode, with about a third of each episode's score being newly written for the supernatural legend. For example, off-angle shots in "Dead in the Water" are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes. As well, spoken words such as "water" and "die" are followed by a lower pitch because Lennertz felt it created a "gurgly" water sound. An electric cello and woodwinds helped to create a big emotional tone in the episode "Home", with Lennertz feeling that the final cue "became a very cinematic musical moment". To fit in with the episode's ambiance in "Asylum", Gruska made the music very subtle; Lennertz felt that it was "creepy-crawly" like "a snake sneaking along the ground". Conversely, Lennertz matched the theme of traveling evangelists in "Faith" by using a small 76-key piano that was damaged and slightly out of tune. He attached small items such as coins and paper clips to the keys to create a rattling noise, making the piano seem "old and crappy". Lennertz then played "bluesy gospel music" during the sermon scenes involving the Reapers. Because he felt that there was also a "snake-oil salesman vibe" to the episode, he included an Armenian duduk due to its association with snake charming. The score of "Hell House", on the other hand, had a much lighter tone to coincide with the episode's humor. For example, music for the scenes involving the "professional" ghost hunters used percussion instruments to slightly mimic the "" theme.
However, recurring characters often have certain musical themes attached to them. For the pilot episode, Lennertz used a piano solo with discordant notes and reverberations to create a "really nasty"-sounding echo effect for the scenes involving Mary and Jessica's deaths at the hands of the demon Azazel. Lennertz returns to this in "Nightmare", including it when Sam realizes the connection he shares with the demon and Max. The episode "Dead in the Water" was the first to use what Kripke feels is the "Winchester emotion", which involves sorrowful and reverberating piano notes on top of strings. It plays when the brothers make connections with other characters. As well, there are variants of a guitar line used as the "humorous brothers' theme" in many episodes, including "Pilot" and "Hell House", when the brothers are having fun. With Gruska writing Meg Masters' theme for "Scarecrow", Lennertz reused the music in "Shadow" but "took the scary up a notch" to imply to the viewers that she is both "more important and more devilish" than the other creatures in the episode. For the penultimate episode "Salvation", Lennertz incorporated musical elements used throughout the season.
In addition to the score, the series makes use of rock songs, with most being selected from Kripke's private collection. Among the many bands featured in the first season are AC/DC, Blue Ãyster Cult, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Bad Company. Rock songs are also usually featured in "The Road So Far" montages at the beginning of select episodes that recap previous events. This was first done with the episode "Salvation", in which the entire season was recapped to Kansas' "Carry On Wayward Son", with the subsequent episodeâthe season finaleâusing Triumph's "Fight the Good Fight".
Effects.
To depict the supernatural aspects of the show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. While various companies were contracted for the Los Angeles-based production of the pilot episode, subsequent episodes being filmed in Vancouver required a new crew to be hired. The company Entity FX performed the visual effects for the pilot episode, with Ivan Hayden taking over as visual effects supervisor for the rest of the season. The crew was required to design all of the external airplane shots in "Phantom Traveler" from scratch using computer-generated imagery (CGI). As well, they created a time-manipulation effect for the titular villain in "Bloody Mary" by altering the capture frame rate of the camera. Randy Shymkiw acted as special effects supervisor, and the department found the episode "Asylum" to be quite a challenge because one scene has the vengeful spirit collapse into dust. They made casts of the character's torso and hands, and had to find the perfect mixture in order to have the casts remain solid but disintegrate when needed.
The visual and special effects departments often overlap, such as in Mary Winchester's death scene in the pilot episode. Because the character is pinned to the ceiling and burned to death, actress Samantha Smith was required to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© body was ignited on a fake ceiling. When the burning of the titular creature in the episode "Wendigo" was not sufficient using special effects, a wire-frame mannequin wrapped in steel wool was then burned, with the scene being composited into the original footage to draw out the wendigo's death. To make it appear that the Hook Man is invisible as he scrapes his hook along the wall for one of the scenes in "Hook Man", a wire was placed inside plaster walls and then pulled out; the wire later was digitally removed in post-production. In the episode "Bugs", the cast had to be sealed in a small area with hundreds of bees, and were stung despite wearing special costumes with cuffs sewn into their sleeves and pants. However, the bees did not show up well on camera, so most of them that appear in the final version were added with CGI.
In addition to the digital effects, the series also features stuntwork. Lou Bollo took over as stunt coordinator after the pilot episode, and big scenes often involved the actors, though stunt doubles were used for certain moments. For the final lake scene in "Dead in the Water", in which Dean must save a boy after he is pulled underwater by a vengeful spirit, Jensen Ackles had to hold onto the young actor as they were pulled down ten feet into the water by divers. The actor portraying the vengeful spirit had to wear a wetsuit under his costume due to the extended period of time he was required to spend in the lake. Ackles and Jared Padalecki performed most of the fight scene featured in "Skin", and only took four hours to learn the fight choreography. However, stunt doubles were brought in for the scenes in which they are thrown into bookshelves and through a coffee table. For the episode "Shadow", rather than filming at the exterior location for the scene of Meg Masters being thrown out of a window to the street below, it was decided to not depict the impact, instead having the Winchesters look down at her body after the landing. Thus, filming of it was allowed to take place in the studio using a body double.
Throughout filming, various scenes make use of all three effects departments. For scenes involving the floating, fiery spirit of Mary Winchester in "Home", a small and slim stuntman wearing a fire suit was lit on fire and raised into the air on wires. For the spirit's transition into Mary's normal form, Smith stood in front of a black background with wind blowing onto her, and the two scenes were later combined in post-production. Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale "Devil's Trap". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of Lexan placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them. For scenes of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled together by a winch, and driven toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to then barrel roll as the truck drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail and the truck to go out of control. The truck began to jackknife, but the stuntman driving it saved it from flipping. The mistake ended up being beneficial for the scene, as Kripke and director Manners found it to look "pretty real".
Reception.
After the first four episodes of "Supernatural" aired in 2005, the WB decided to pick up the series for a full season of 22Â episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18â34 and 12â34. It also posted an increase of 73% in males aged 18â49 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, "Gilmore Girls". "Supernatural"'s first season averaged about 3.81Â million American viewers. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 "Supernatural" convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.
The first season of the series received mixed reviews from critics. Tanner Stransky of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the first season a B, saying the show "comes off as weekly installments of a horror movie series", but that "Adding to the show's cred are the '67 Chevy Impala the boys rumble around in and their kick-ass soundtrack". Tom Gliatto of "People Weekly" ranked the show at number five on his list of the Best TV Shows of 2005. Peter Schorn of "IGN" gave the season a score of 7 out of 10. While he found the self-enclosed episodes to be "passably entertaining", he enjoyed the story arcs introduced later in the season. Schorn also deemed the "stormy relationship between Sam and his father" to be "compelling", and noted that the lead stars have "good chemistry together". Rick Porter of "Zap2it" felt that while the season had its "share of emotional moments", it also " the pants off" of viewers "surprisingly well". He also believed that it did a good job at balancing mythology episodes with self-enclosed ones, comparing it to the early seasons of "The X-Files". However, Eric Neigher of "Slant Magazine" highly criticized the self-enclosed episodes for being "almost totally linear, without any B- or C-stories", and felt that the episodes were mainly "watered-down rehashes of classic weird fiction or popular urban legends".
Work on the pilot episode garnered two Primetime Emmy Awards nominations in 2006, composer Christopher Lennertz being nominated in the category of "Outstanding Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore)" and the sound editors receiving a nomination for "Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series". The pilot episode also brought in a nomination for a Golden Reel Award in the category of "Best Sound Editing in Television: Short Form â Sound Effects and Foley", with work on the episode "Salvation" gaining the same nomination in 2007. Additionally, the season was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category of "Best Network Television Series". For the Teen Choice Awards, the series was nominated for "TV â Choice Breakout Show" and Jensen Ackles for "TV â Choice Breakout Star".
Home media release.
The first season of "Supernatural" was released as a six-disc RegionÂ 1 DVD box set on September 5, 2006, three weeks before the premiere of the second season. The cover art incorporated a stylized shot of the Winchester brothers in front of their car. Including all 22Â episodes of the first season, the set also featured DVD extras such as episode commentaries, deleted scenes, bloopers, featurettes, and a DVD-ROM sneak-peek at the second season. The season was ranked No.Â 14 in DVD sales for its week of release, and slipped to No.Â 28 the following week, with cumulative sales during those two weeks coming to 150,376Â sets for $5,264,942. The set was later packaged with the first season of "Smallville" as a "Season One Starter Pack", which was released on September 18, 2007. For RegionÂ 2, the season was split into two parts, being released on May 22, 2006, and August 21, 2006; the complete set was released on October 2, 2006. The season was also released in RegionÂ 4 on September 6, 2006, though the special features were removed. A "Special Collector's Edition" was later released on October 2, 2007, with the extras restored. The first season was released on Region A Blu-ray Disc on June 15, 2010, including new special featuresâ"The Devil's Road Map", an interactive guide featuring interviews about every episode and a Paley Festival panel discussion featuring the cast and crew.

The agency believes that it received either incomplete or falsified certification information. 
Current Models.
WF650-T and WF650-C.
The Wildfire WF650-T is a three-wheeled truck. The Wildfire WF650-C is a three-wheeled hatchback sedan. Both are registered with the Department of Transportation as motorcycles. They are powered by a 650Â cc water-cooled 4-stroke twin engine. The manufacturer states the vehicles get up to 60 miles per gallon, although some dealers have suggested 40â60 miles per gallon is a more realistic figure. Both vehicles are manufactured by Jiangsu Sandi Motorcycle Co Ltd.
On April 3, 2013: EPA withdrew its approval of the import and sale of over 70,000 gas-powered on- and off-road motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles because the agency believes that it received either incomplete or falsified certification information. EPA issued the vehicle certificates from 2006 to 2012 to two companies which operate as Snyder Technology, Inc. and Snyder Computer Systems, Inc. (doing business as Wildfire Motors Corporation). As a result of a lengthy investigation, the agency believes that the applications for the certificates contained fallacious information and must be voided.

Skylace Language Centre is a language centre that teaches children Mandarin. It was established in 1997.
Teaching Methods.
Skylace educates children using fun and innovative methods, such as using games that encourage movement and other popular games modified to educate the children. Memorization is also an important aspect of learning Mandarin the Skylace way. After learning words and playing games, students often have to complete worksheets which will test how well they have learned the vocabulary. Students also have to memorize the writing of words and have to write them out the next week.
Skylace also uses "Hanyu Pinyin", which helps students to master the pronunciation of words.
Locations.
These are the main locations in Malaysia.
Icons.
The bright blue cotton bag has become somewhat of an icon for Skylace Language Centre, as it is used by students to carry their folders and worksheets to and from lessons. It replaces the former navy blue box-like folders, which had sharp edges and was bulky, proving a faulty design. Many students enjoy the new blue bags.

Laura Letinsky

Laura L. Letinsky (born 1962) is a Canadiancontemporary photographer, best known for her still lifes.
Much of Letinsky's work alludes to human presence, without including any actual figures. For example, in the "Morning and Melancholia" (c. 1997-2001), and the "I Did Not Remember I Had Forgotten" (c. 2002-2004) series, Letinsky seems to document the aftermath of a sumptuous gathering or dinner party. Faded flower petals intermingle with empty glasses and crumbs of food on partially cleared tables, often covered with a white linen that bears the mark of spilled wine. As alluded in the title "Morning and Melancholia" these scenes are often filled with a fresh, clear light, as though one is viewing from the perspective of the morning after, what the host failed to clean up the evening before. However, the title of the series itself is a reference to an essay by Freud, "Mourning and Melancholia," which discusses the human response to loss. The title "I Did Not Remember I Had Forgotten" also has a literary source; it refers to a line by St. Augustine, commenting on memory, "One would never say I did not remember I had forgotten." Letinsky responded:
I was thinking, "No, that's not right!" Actually, I felt I had just come to this moment where I did not remember that I had forgotten, and it had to do with music. I'd gone for three years without listening to music. I would drive in the car and I would want silence, or I would listen to talk shows. Then for some reason I began listening to the radio, and some of the CDs I had around, and it was almost like drinking water after being really thirsty. I took such pleasure in it. Somehow, I did not remember that I'd forgotten to turn on the music.
The "Somewhere, Somewhere" series (c. 2005) explores similar themes of seemingly vacated domestic settings. Empty rooms and corridors bear only traces of their inhabitants: a scrap of paper on the floor, a lamp left hanging on the bare wallÂ â these photographs might show apartments in the liminal time between tenants, full of old memories on the one hand, and expectation on the other.
A recent exhibition of her work includes the following artist statement:
"Still life is unavoidably an engagement with and commentary upon societyâs material-mindedness. Laura Letinskyâs photographs of forgotten details such as wrapping paper, plastic containers, Styrofoam cups, cans, leftover food bits, and found trinkets remark upon these remnants of daily subsistence and pleasure. Of major influence are Dutch-Flemish and Italian still-life paintings whose exacting beauty documented shifting social attitudes resulting from exploration, colonization, economics, and ideas about seeing as a kind of truth. But instead of the traditional allure of a meal awaiting an unseen viewerâs consumption, Letinsky photographs the remains of the table so as to investigate the precarious relationships between ripeness and decay, delicacy and awkwardness, control and haphazardness, waste and plenitude, pleasure and sustenance. What is looked at is "after the fact," what (ma)lingers, what persists, and by inference, what is gone. 
The photographs in After All veer into darkness; literally, as regards the time of day the photograph is made, as well as emotionally and psychologically. Little bits and pieces hover in white grounds blown flat by blinding light, later lurking in deep inky grayed out pools. Light, through its abundance and its absence, can record and reveal as well as obscure and exaggerate. Formally, through degrees of control and chaos, the domestic scenes Letinsky photographs are redolent with the allures of domesticity (safety, comfort, familiarity) as well as its dangers (boredom, satiation, lack of desire). These liminal images are not intended as accurate visual description, rather aspiring to describe another kind of sensing. What one sees is not always visible and Letinsky explores photographyâs transformative quality, changing what is typically overlooked into something splendid in its resilience."
Letinsky is the author of several books,[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226473457]
including:
Recent solo exhibitions include:
 Hot and Cold All Over, Joseph Carroll and Sons, Boston
 Ill Form and Void Full, Yancey Richardson Gallery, NY; Valerie Carberry Gallery, Chicago, Museum of Hagen, Germany
 Laura Letinsky: Still Life, Denver Museum of Art, CO
Letinsky holds a BFA from the University of Manitoba (class of 1986), and an MFA from Yale University, 1991. Her two cats are named Bean and Einstein. She is currently a Professor of Visual Arts at the University of Chicago.
Additional Projects:
Molosco: In 2009 Letinsky developed Molosco, a series of white hand formed porcelain tableware with gold trim, begun as a quest for the perfect bowl from which to eat fish soup. Having studied both photography and cermics, she began to experiment with finding the right form and then quickly expanded to include plates, cups, serving platters, and more bowls, some of which were incorporated into her photography. In 2014 she joined forces with Jose NoÃ© Suro Salceda, owner of Ceramicasuro, a porcelain producer in Guadalajara, who is also an avid art collector and has a history of collaborating with contemporary artists like Judy Legerwood, Arturo Herrerra, Liam Gillick, Marcel Dzama, and Jorge Pardo. Together he and Letinsky set out to make the Molosco collction that maintains Letinsky's artistic vision while being entirely usable. 
Stain, L+M: Working with John Paul Morabito, they've designed a set of eight different spill patterns digitally woven into fine Spanish unbleached cotton and linen napkins that, with use will acquire ongoing patina as evidence of conviviality. The standard of classic white napkin is rejected in its notion of perfection as an illusion that demands unsustainable and destructive practices. "Stain" napkins embrace smears and dabs both for their beauty as well as record of life well lived.

<doc id="18569445" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18569445" title="Henry Mouzon">
Henry Mouzon

Henry Mouzon II was a distinguished colonial era patriot and renowned civil engineer. He prepared the definitive survey of the North and South Carolina Colonies prior to the start of the American Revolutionary War. He served as an Officer of the Continental Line and as a Militia Officer in Francis Marionâs Brigade, where he distinguished himself in the Battle of Black Mingo.
Early life.
Mouzonâ s family was of French Huguenot ancestry. His parents were William Henry Mouzon, I (born 1713) and Anne Videau. The family immigrated to Mouzon, South Carolina which is located in present-day Williamsburg County. Their son William Henry II was born on May 18, 1741 at the Mouzon Plantation. William Henry II spoke fluent French. Following his fatherâs death in 1749, eight-year-old Henry II was sent to France to further his education.
The Mouzon Map.
Mouzon subsequently graduated from the Sorbonne as a civil engineer and surveyor of the first rank. He received his first important public commission in 1771, when he and Ephraim Mitchell were appointed by Governor Lord Charles Grevill Montague to survey the boundaries of the civil districts of South Carolina. In May 1774, Mouzon advertised a proposal for a new map of South Carolina with corrections to the two extant maps of the Colony (James Cookâs 1771 "A Map of South Carolina with all the islands, marshes..." and Cook's 1773 "A Map of the Province of South Carolina, with all the rivers..."). When Mouzon's map was published in May 1775 by Sayer and Bennett, it also included North Carolina, likely a decision by the publishers in anticipation of their 1776 American Atlas.
Mouzonâs map became an important military asset for those fighting in the Southern theater of operations during the American Revolutionary War. The copy of the Mouzon map carried by George Washington is preserved at the American Geographical Society in Washington, D.C. The copy of the Mouzon map carried by Lord Cornwallis, the British Commander, is preserved at the University of Michigan Library in Ann Arbor. The Mouzon map remained the chief map of the region until the 1808 map of North Carolina by Price & Strother, and the 1822 map of South Carolina by John Wilson.
Santee Canal.
The South Carolina Commons House of Assembly proposed a survey in 1770 to determine the most favorable routes for a canal to connect the Santee River with the Cooper River which would provide a direct outlet to Charleston Harbor. To this end, Henry Mouzon Jr. was commissioned in 1773 to survey routes for such an inland waterway. His five suggested routes were later abandoned Colonel Johann Christian Senf, However, Mouzon played a seminal role in the creation of America's first true canal system.
Family life.
Mouzon married Susannah Taylor on January 10, 1769 at Black Mingo, South Carolina. Henry and Susannah were the parents of 10 children: Ann, Peter, William Henry III, Samuel Ruffin, Susannah Videau, Sarah Elizabeth, Mary Bonneau, Henry Videau, Edward, and James.
Service in the Revolutionary War.
Mouzonâs life is closely connected to that of his first cousin and closest friend, General Francis Marion, the "Swamp Fox." Francis and Mouzon served together as Lieutenants under Colonels Montgomery and Grant in the colonial campaigns against the Cherokee Indians. Mouzon was commissioned by the Continental Congress as a lieutenant in the Continental Army in 1777. He served in the Third South Carolina Regiment until the fall of Charleston, South Carolina to the British on May 12, 1780. Soon after the fall of Charleston, the British sent three armies from the city to establish garrisons of soldiers in every thickly-settled community in the province. In support of this effort, the Legion of Lieutenant Colonial Banastre Tarleton was sent from Georgetown, South Carolina to Camden, South Carolina by way of Kingstree. Tarleton burned Mouzon's plantation, reportedly because Mouzon was a French Huguenot; this marked the only action of Tarleton's in this campaign that Cornwallis approved.
Following the destruction of the Mouzon Plantation on August 7, 1780, the citizens of Williamsburg sent Major James to Georgetown, South Carolina to inquire of the British Commander, Naval Captain Ardesoif, of the conditions of their parole. James was informed by Ardesoif that the paroled officers of Williamsburg would be expected to take up arms against their countrymen. James left the meeting in a great state of agitation and returned to Williamsburg, where a battalion was organized under Captain Mouzon and several others. Mouzon and two other men left to find Colonel Francis Marion and bring him to Williamsburg to command the battalion. On September 14, 1780, Marion's forces attacked those of Colonel Cumming Ball at the Battle of Black Mingo Creek. Mouzon was severely injured in this battle; his injuries would affect him for the rest of his life.

Erbenochile

Erbenochile is a genus of spinose phacopid (acastid) trilobite found in Lower to Middle Devonian age rocks from Algeria and Morocco. Originally described from an isolated pygidium (the posterior body part or shield), the first complete articulated specimen of E. erbeni revealed the presence of extraordinarily tall eyes:
Number of lenses has been estimated at 560 or 450 incomplete preservation accounting for the uncertainty. A lens count of 18 lenses per file is unusually high (twice that of closely related genus) and accounts for the height of the eye, as opposed to a noticeable increase in the size of the individual lenses. A recently found species ("E. issoumourensis") has smaller eyes, with fewer files (33-35) and fewer lenses per file (13-14 max) than "E. erbeni". "E. erbeni" eyes allow full 360 degree coverage in the horizontal plane and were high enough to allow the trilobite to see backwards over its thorax. The presence of eye shades, blocking glare from over head, validates the suggestion that (at least some) trilobites were diurnal and not nocturnal,
Description.
"Erbenochile" is a trilobite with very large eyes, with 33â36 vertical rows of 13â19 lenses each. The lower edge of eye slightly overhangs the adjacent part of the free cheek. The most backward part of the glabella (or occipital ring), the rings of the thorax, and rings on the pygidium each have a prominent median spine. The thorax consists of 11 segments. The frontal band of each of the lateral parts of the thorax segments (in the so-called pleural region) are not adorned. The posterior bands have a row of distinct small spines. The large tailshield (or pygidium) has 11 pairs of spines along the edge, and one in the middle, and 10â11 pairs of well-defined segments. The frontal pleural bands of each segment on the pygidium is lower compared to the posterior pleural band, and lacks the small spines of the posterior pleural band. The posterior border of pygidium is longer medially than laterally.
Taxonomy.
"Erbenochile" was originally designated as a subgenus to "Odontochile", the type of the Odontochilinae, which was later synonymised with the Dalmanitinae subfamily. Morzadec raised the status to a full genus and moved it to the Asteropyginae, by virtue of having pygidial spines, a character unlike any Odontochilinae. But "Erbenochile" also differs from all other genera now assigned to the Asteropyginae in a number of characters. The much larger number of segments of the pygidium, as expressed in the number of axial rings, pleural rib pairs and pygidial spines (23 versus 11, and in "Gourdonia" 13 spines) is most conspicuous. Also, the pygidial border has a smooth connection with the pygidial spines, while in the Asteropyginae the connection with the pygidial lappets have relief. Furthermore, in "Erbenochile" the split of the lateral glabellar furrow and the second and third transglabellar furrows (confusingly called S2 and S1) are very deep, comparable the situation in Dalmanitinae.

Battle of Tarpellanca

The Battle of Tarpellanca (September 26, 1820) took place between the forces of nascent Chilean Army and Spanish royalist guerrillas, in the context of the "Total War" campaign, during the later stages of the Chilean War of Independence.
Background.
After their victory at the Battle of Pangal, the Loyalist forces, composed of approximately 2,400 guerrilla and Mapuche Allies under the command of Vicente Benavides, decided to attack and destroy the city of Los Angeles. This city was defended by around 400 line soldiers under the command of Marshal Pedro AndrÃ©s del AlcÃ¡zar, and had already survived four attempts by the same enemy.
At this juncture, Marshal del AlcÃ¡zar received forged orders from General RamÃ³n Freire to evacuate the city and move his forces to reinforce ChillÃ¡n and meet with the main Army that was operating out of ConcepciÃ³n. Marshal del AlcÃ¡zar, ignorant of the defeat suffered by the Patriot army at Pangal decided to evacuate the city, taking with him all the inhabitants, who otherwise would have been massacred by the guerrillas. He left the city on the 25th at the head of the "Cazadores de Coquimbo" battalion, 50 artillery troops, approximately 150 friendly Mapuche allies and about a thousand civilians, with their properties and animals. The long train made for a very slow speed.
The battle.
As he was crossing the Laja River at the Tarpellanca ford, early on the morning of the 26th, the column was attacked by the troops of Benavides at the point where the river branched into two inlets leaving an islet in the middle. Marshal del AlcÃ¡zar and almost all of his column were trapped there at the islet. A defense was hastily organized by making a circle out of the carts, but after 13 hours of battle, just as night was falling, the patriots started to run out of ammunition.
In order to try to save the many civilians that were traveling with his column, he decided to negotiate with Benavides. The Patriots surrendered in exchange for their lives and free passage for all the civilians, while Marshal del AlcÃ¡zar and his officers were to remain as hostages and the surviving soldiers were to incorporate themselves to the guerrilla. The final truce was agreed at 2AM on the 27th.
Aftermath.
After the surrender of the troops, Benavides ordered the prisoners to restart the march towards Yumbel. On the morning of the 28th, Benavides ordered all the prisoners executed, which were then shot, lanced and the bodies torn apart. The city of Los Angeles was torched.

Conrad Bernier

Conrad Bernier (b. Quebec City 9 May 1904, d. Washington, DC, 7 Nov 1988) was a French-Canadian organist, composer, and teacher.
Early life and education.
Born into a prominent family of musicians in Quebec City, Bernier is the brother of pianist Gabrielle Bernier and cellist/journalist Maurice Bernier, and the uncle of musicians FranÃ§oys Bernier, Madeleine Bernier, and Pierre Bernier. His first teacher was his father Joseph-Arthur Bernier, who introduced him to solfÃ¨ge, organ, and piano. He continued his keyboard studies with Berthe Roy, and became so proficient, that he inaugurated the organ of the church at Bienville when he was only 13 years of age. The following year he inaugurated that of St-Sacrement Church in Quebec City. In this church he would serve 1920-23 as principal organist, while he was also assistant organist at St-Jean-Baptiste.
In 1923 Bernier won the Prix dâEurope to study organ in Paris. There he studied 1923-26, taking piano with Sylvia HÃ©rard and Simone PlÃ©-Caussade, Music Theory with Georges Caussade (theory), and organ with the great organist from Bordeaux, Joseph Bonnet, for whom he also substituted at the great organs of the church of St-Eustache. In 1962 he was awarded a Doctorate of Music from St. Francis, Loretto, Pennsylvania.
Professional career.
In 1926 he returned to Canada for a concert tour, after which he was organist at the Church of the Visitation in Detroit for several months. His next appointment was at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he became director of the Organ Department in 1927. In that capacity he taught for almost half a century until he was named Professor Emeritus in 1974. After that he continued teaching counterpoint, fugue, and composition until the eve of his death in 1988, having a number of distinguished students, among them Don Shirley, Helmut Braunlich, Richard S.Parks, Thomas Tumulty, Haig Mardirosian, Richard Reiter, Dieter Lehnhoff, Anthony Doherty, and Micheal Houlahan. In Washington he was organist at the church of Ste. Anne (1935â69) and also became the regular organist of the Basilica of the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. During World War II, he was one of the three interim conductors of the Cathedral Choral Society at Washington National Cathedral. He returned to Canada to give courses 1943-47 and to give recitals and performances for the Casavant Society.

Apple Worm

The Apple Worm is a computer program written for the Apple computer, and especially for the component 6502 microprocessor, which performs the act of dynamic self-relocation. The source code of the Apple Worm is the first program printed in its entirety within the Scientific American. The Apple Worm was designed and developed by James R. Hauser and William R. Buckley.
Because the Apple Worm performs dynamic self-relocation within the one main memory of one computer, it does not constitute a computer virus, an apt if somewhat inaccurate description. Though the analogous behavior of copying code between memories is exactly the act performed by a computer virus, the virus has other characters not present in the worm. Note, such programs do not necessarily cause collateral damage to the computing systems upon which their instructions execute; there is no reliance upon a vector to ensure subsequent execution. This extends to the computer virus; it need not be destructive in order to effect its communication between computational environments.
Programs.
The typical computer program manipulates data which is external to the corporeal representation of the computer program. In programmer-ese, this means the code and data spaces are kept separate. Programs which manipulate data which is internal to its corporeal representation, such as that held in the code space, are self-relational; in part at least, its function is to maintain its function. In this sense, a dynamic self-relocator is a self-referential system, as defined by Douglas R. Hofstadter. 
Other Examples.
The instruction set of the PDP-11 computer includes an instruction for moving data, which when constructed in a particular form causes itself to be moved from higher addresses to lower addresses; the form includes an automatic decrement of the instruction pointer register. Hence, when this instruction includes autodecrement of the instruction pointer, it behaves as a dynamic self-relocator.
A more current example of a self-relocating program is an adaptation of the Apple Worm for the Intel 80x86 microprocessor, and its derivatives, such as the Pentium, and corresponding AMD microprocessors.

William Railton

William Railton (1800â77) was an English architect, best known as the designer of Nelson's Column. He was based in London with offices at 12 Regent Street for much of his career.
Life.
He was born in Clapham (then in Surrey) on 14 May 1800, the son of Isaac Railton and his wife, Margaret Maria Railton, nÃ©e Scott.
He was a pupil of the London architect and surveyor William Inwood.
In 1825 Railton set off for a tour of Greece and Egypt. On his return to England he prepared drawings of the temple at Kardaki on Corfu which were published as a supplementary volume to James Stuart's "Antiquities of Athens".
In the mid-1830s, Railton carried out commissions for Ambrose March Phillipps, a Leicestershire landowner who had converted to Catholicism at an early age. On his marriage his father, Charles March Phillips of Garendon Park, had given him one of the family's other Leicestershire estates, on which stood the ruins of the priory of Grace Dieu. At Grace Dieu, Railton built a neo-Tudor manor house, complete with chapel. Meanwhile, Ambrose Phillipps bought - with borrowed money - a tract of land in nearby Charnwood Forest to build a monastery for a community of trappist monks. For the new monastery - named Mount St Bernard - Railton designed a church, with monastic buildings in, once again a neo-Tudor style. The church was consecrated in October 1837. Railton's buildings were, however, soon replaced by a much more ambitious monastic complex to plans by Pugin. For Charles March Phillipps, Railton designed lodges and gatehouses for Garendon Park, which have survived the demolition of the main house.
Railton also designed two identical Anglican churches in Charnwood Forest, at Copt Oak and Woodhouse Eaves, (consecrated on 3 September and 5 September 1837). He went on to build churches nearby at Groby (c.1840) and Thorpe Acre (1845), the latter on land donated by Charles March Phillipps.
Also in Leicestershire, he designed Beaumanor Hall for the Herrick family
At Ripon he designed a palace for the bishop. The foundation stone was laid at a ceremony in October 1838, and by the end of 1841 it was ready for the Bishop to move in. Four years later, Railton was asked to add a chapel, slightly separate from the palace, to allow the local population to worship there. In deference to the Tudor style of the palace, he chose the perpendicular style, battlemented like the main building.
Between 1838 and 1848 he was employed as architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners during which time he produced two standard designs for parsonages. During this time he also remodelled Riseholme as a house for the Bishop of Lincoln.
In 1836 he won the fourth prize in the competition to design a replacement for the Houses of Parliament which had recently been destroyed by fire, and in 1839 came first in the competition to design a monument to Admiral Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square, London. His winning design â a simple Corinthian column topped with a statue of Nelson â was constructed between 1839 and 1842; the lions on the base, although part of the original plan, were not added until 1867.
Railton exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1829 and 1851.
He built nothing after 1850. For the last part of his life he lived at 65 Onslow Square, Kensington and died on 13 October 1877, while visiting Brighton.

USS Lancewood (AN-48)

USS "Lancewood" (AN-48/YN-67) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. In service in the Pacific during the war, she earned one battle star. After her February 1946 decommissioning, she was sold to France as Commandant Charcot. Her fate is not reported in secondary sources.
Career.
"Lancewood" (YN-67) was laid down as "Ironwood" 15 October 1942 by Pollack-Stockton Shipbuilding Company, Stockton, California; renamed "Lancewood" 3 April 1943; launched 2 May 1943; and commissioned 18 October 1943, Lt. Tyler Kaune in command. After shakedown off the California coast, "Lancewood" was assigned to the 12th Naval District, San Francisco, California. Reclassified "AN-48" on 20 January 1944, she tended nets and repaired net lines until departing San Francisco 1 December. Loaded with fleet moorings, she steamed via San Pedro, California, to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived the 16th.
"Lancewood" sailed for the western Pacific Ocean 24 January 1945. After touching Eniwetok and Guam, she reached a holding area off Iwo Jima 20 February and 3 days later began pulling damaged landing craft off the beaches to facilitate unloading operations. She placed moorings, laid nets, and salvaged landing craft off Iwo Jima until 12 April when she departed for the Mariana Islands.
"Lancewood" served at Guam from 19 April to 10 June; then she proceeded to Ulithi, where she arrived 12 June for duty as net repair ship. She began to remove net defenses 30 August, then steamed to Yap Island 2 September for the surrender of Japanese forces there the following day. She remained at Yap until 7 September, returned to Ulithi the 8th, and resumed net removal operations.
Loaded with net panels, "Lancewood" sailed to Saipan 14 to 17 October and unloaded her cargo. Departing 26 October, she steamed via Midway Islands and Pearl Harbor for the U.S. West Coast, arriving San Francisco 25 November. 
Remaining at San Francisco, she decommissioned 11 February 1946. Berthed at Suisun Bay, California, she was sold 28 April 1947 to Robert A. Martinolich, San Francisco, and transferred 3 May to the U.S. Maritime Commission for simultaneous delivery to her purchaser, the French government, and commissioned as "Commandant Charcot".
Honors and awards.
"Lancewood" received one battle star for World War II service.

Hello Heartbreak

"Hello Heartbreak" is a dance-pop song recorded by American singer-songwriter Michelle Williams. It was co-written by Williams, James Scheffer, Travis Jones and Rico Love, and produced by Alex da Kid and Jay Wes for Williams' third studio album "Unexpected" (2008). The song was set to be released as the album's third single and as the first official UK single from the re-release of "Unexpected", but plans were shelved.
Critical reception.
"Hello Heartbreak" received universally positive reception from critics. Mikael Wood of the "Billboard" described the song as a "shiny electro-R&B gem", while Josette Compton of "Entertainment Weekly" noted the "technodriven" track is "reminiscent of Kylie Minogue". Pete Lewis of "Blues & Soul" also compared the song to other works, commenting that the "synth-heavy uptempo cut" "heavily" relies "on the kind of Euro-dance-inspired electronica utilised recently by fellow US urbanites like Timbaland and Justin Timberlake".
UK Release.
In June 2009 Michelle confirmed via Twitter that her album "Unexpected" would receive a full UK re-release and that "Hello Heartbreak" would be the first single set for release in July, 2009, but those plans were unexepctedly scrapped.

The Greatest (Michelle Williams song)

"The Greatest" is a ballad recorded by American singer-songwriter Michelle Williams. It was co-written by Jim Jonsin and Rico Love, and produced by Jim Jonsin for Williams' third studio album "Unexpected" (2008). The song was released as the album's second single in September 2008. It was listed at number thirty-nine on Billboard's decade-end (2000â2009) Hot Dance Club Songs chart, just behind "Lose My Breath" which Williams recorded as a member of Destiny's Child five years prior.
Background and composition.
The song was sent to radio stations on August 25, 2008. The track was also officially released and available to purchase September 9, 2008. The song gained more recognition after being used in the movie "". Michelle performed the song on Fox Light, "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" and AOL Sessions.
"The Greatest" is a "pop ballad". Written by Rico Love and James Scheffer (better known as Jim Jonsin) and also produced by Scheffer, it is set in common time and composed at a moderate tempo, featuring additional vocals by Rico Love along with a piano riff and a militant drum loop. The song has a basic sequence of C-G-Am-F as its chord progression. Its lyrical content "details the unnecessary search for a significant other when a perfect candidate is right in front of your face". Williams' vocal range in the song spans almost two octaves from the note G3 to the note F5.
Critical reception.
Like the other singles from "Unexpected", "The Greatest" received universally positive reviews from critics. Ben Norman of "About.com" hailed the song as "a fantastic pop ballad" while Robin Carolan of "Slant Magazine" noted that "in the lush balladry of "The Greatest," Williams could find the hit she needs". DJ Z of "DJBooth.net" wrote that the song is a "solid single selection", while it received a rating of four out of five stars, based on forty-four ratings by the site's users. Meanwhile, Story Gilmore of "Neon Limelight" wrote that Williams "nails the vocals!" on "The Greatest" which she described positively as "pretty ding moist".
Commercial performance.
Despite the single receiving minor airplay in the U.S., "The Greatest" received much play in clubs and so it debuted at number fifty-four on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart before eventually peaking at number one â becoming Williams' second consecutive, top 5 hit on the chart. "The Greatest" also peaked at number twenty-five on the "Billboard" Global Dance Tracks chart. The song was listed at number thirty-nine on "Billboard"'s decade-end (2000â2009) Hot Dance Club Songs chart, just behind "Lose My Breath" which Williams recorded as a member of Destiny's Child five years prior.
Music video.
The video was shot on September 22 in Los Angeles, California and was directed by Thomas Kloss. It later premiered on Yahoo! on October 20, 2008. In November 2008, the video peaked at number seventy-six on the US Hot 100 Music Video chart and has peaked at number thirty-two on the Yahoo Top 100 R&B Music Video chart.
The video starts with "a capture of" Williams "donning a black tube gown and singing the song on her bed", frequently cutting to scenes of a man on a "field", "coaching his football players". The video then solely focuses on Williams during the first verse, who is also seen sporting a reasonably short, purple cocktail dress in a sitting room during another scene. Other scenes feature Williams posing with various items of clothing in a black dress, in front of a white screen and walking around an outdoor swimming pool in a cream-colored dress with, brown, high-heeled shoes. As the video progresses, scenes of other men; a US athlete running on a track, a fireman and a mechanic working on a car are included. The video concludes with Williams opening a large, wooden door outside, before the scene fades completely into white, ending the video.
R. Thomas of "Tha Feedback" described the video as "sweet and innocent", writing that "Michelle looks all warm and friendly". Thomas then commented that "this is good video for this song", before describing the song as "a nice mid-tempo ballad".

Gentlemen Are Born

Gentlemen Are Born is a 1934 American drama film directed by Alfred E. Green and starring Franchot Tone.
The film's pre-release title was "Just Out of College". A news item in "Daily Variety" notes that Warner Bros. was sued for $250,000 by Ronald Wagoner and James F. Wickizer who contended that the film was based on their story "Yesterday's Heroes."
Plot.
Four friends, Bob Bailey (Tone), Tom Martin (Ross Alexander), Smudge Casey (Dick Foran) and Fred Harper (Robert Light), are certain that upon their graduation from college, they will conquer the world. They face disappointment when they look for jobs, however. Because of the Depression, jobs are scarce and each one has many applicants. 
Fred goes to work for his father, Mr. Harper (Henry O'Neill), a prominent stockbroker. Eventually Bob, who intends to become a journalist, manages to sell occasional articles to the newspaper, and Tom also finds work. Smudge, a star athlete, unsuccessfully looks for work as a coach. Tom is in love with Trudy Talbot (Jean Muir), who moves to New York to be near him. She shares a room with Susan Merrill (Ann Dvorak), a librarian. Tom invites Bob to double date with him and Trudy, hoping that he will become interested in Susan, but Bob is in love with Fred's sister Joan Harper (Margaret Lindsay), even though they are of different social classes. When Bob attends a boxing match on assignment from the paper, he sees Smudge fighting for a few dollars. 
Realizing that Smudge is broke, Susan and Bob invite him for Sunday breakfast. Soon Susan and Smudge fall in love. Shortly after, Tom and Trudy marry, as do Susan and Smudge. Joan and Bob date despite her mother's wishes that she only go out with men of her class. Smudge is fired from his job as a truck driver because there is not enough work and Susan loses her job because she is married. Meanwhile, Tom and Trudy have a baby. Mr. Harper is implicated in a trust failure and kills himself, leaving his family in reduced circumstances. For this reason, Joan decides to accept a proposal from wealthy Stephen Hornblow (Charles Starrett), even though she is in love with Bob. 
Completely desperate, Smudge robs a pawnshop of ten dollars in order to buy food and he is shot running away. Bob keeps his identity out of the papers and Susan returns to her parents. When Joan meets Bob at Tom and Trudy's, where they have gone to visit the new baby, she confesses that she is not going to give up her life to support her family. Instead she will follow her heart and marry Bob.

Stigmata High-Five

Stigmata-High Five is the seventh full-length album by the Canadian grindcore band Fuck the Facts released August 20, 2006 (see 2006 in music). It is the band's first release on Relapse Records. "Stigmata High-Five" is also the first recording to feature Mathieu VilandrÃ© on drums. He had joined the band as a second guitarist in 2005 and took over drumming duties after Tim Olsen was asked to leave the band.
In January 2006 it was announced that "Stigmata High-Five" would be released on Great White North Records in May of that year. The Collection of Splits 2002-2004, which was slated for a February release, was pushed back until late May, and ended up being the final release on Great White North Records before it folded. However, early into the recording of "Stigmata High-Five", Relapse Records contacted the band and secured a three-album deal.
The album was released on an enhanced CD that contains 2 bonus tracks in MP3 format, as well as a "making of" video and a music video. The album was also released on 3 different colors of vinyl; white (limited to 300 copies), red (limited to 600 copies) and clear (limited to 100 copies and not available to the public).
Track listing.
All music by Fuck the Facts with assistance where indicated.<br>
All lyrics By Mel Mongeon and Timothy Leo.
Recording.
This album marks the first time that the band recorded in a studio other than their own, and with a producer outside of the band. It was recorded February 16âMarch 1, 2006 at Studio En-Phase in MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec. The recording quality is much higher than their previous recordings, but the performances remain "raw" sounding. No drum triggers were used, and all of the guitar parts were run through amps, as opposed to being recorded direct into the board.

Self-relocation

In computer programming, a self-relocating program is a program that relocates its own address-dependent instructions and data when run, and is therefore capable of being loaded into memory at any address.
Self-relocating code is a form of self modifying code.
Discussion.
Self-relocation is similar to the relocation process employed by the linker-loader when a program is copied from external storage into main memory; the difference is that it is the loaded program rather than the loader that performs the relocation.
As an extreme example of self-relocation it is possible to construct a computer program so that it does not stay at a fixed address in memory, even as it executes. The Apple Worm is a dynamic self-relocator.

Bengal Bouts

The Bengal Bouts is an annual charity boxing tournament hosted by the Men's Boxing Club at the University of Notre Dame, with proceeds benefiting the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. Begun in 1920 by legendary football coach Knute Rockne to condition football players in the offseason, the tournament later expanded entry to any member of the student body. Under the guidance and direction of Dominic "Nappy" Napolitano, the charity aspect of the event flourished while following the Men's Boxing Club mantra: ""Strong Bodies Fight, that Weak Bodies May Be Nourished."" 
The training regimen requires novice boxers to receive instruction and conditioning in the fall, and returning fighters begin their mandatory workouts during an intensive 6-week period prior to the tournament.In current times, the Men's Boxing Club membership has swelled to include over 230 students, ranging from first-year undergraduate students to graduate and law school students, with participants fighting across 12 weight classes. In 2010, the Bengal Bouts helped generate a donation of $100,000 for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. This surpassed the $1,000,000 donated throughout the program's existence.
Originally held in the Notre Dame Fieldhouse, the tournament is currently held in the Joyce Center (JACC).
In 2005, a sister program, named the Baraka Bouts, was instituted for women and benefits missions in East Africa.

David Levinthal

David Levinthal (1949, San Francisco, California) is a photographer who lives and works in New York.
Biography.
David Levinthal received a ScientiÃ¦ Magister in Management Science from the MIT Sloan School of Management (1981), an MFA in Photography from Yale University (1973), and a BA in Studio Art from Stanford University (1970). He was also the recipient of a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1995 and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in 1990-1991.
Levinthal is included in many public collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, among many others. He has recently had solo exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles,and Portland, Oregon.
David Levinthal has produced a diverse oeuvre, utilizing primarily large-format Polaroid photography. His works touch upon many aspects of American culture, from Barbie to baseball to X-rated dolls. Levinthal uses small toys and props with dramatic lighting to construct mini environments of subject matters varying from war scenes to voyeurism to racial and political references to American pop culture.
Levinthal creates miniature scenarios using shoeboxes, cardboard, and foam core to make miniature offices, hotel rooms, pool halls, foyers and narrow corridors. These shadowy and dark scenes expose the secrecy and intimacy of small spaces. Levinthal is particularly interested in exploring the different emotions that each scene produces, such as reactions to an office corridor in contrast to those to a hospital or a private bedroom. Indeed, there is an inherently voyeuristic aspect to these early works.
Other series include "Modern Romance", exposing the isolation of urban life; "the Wild West"; "Barbie", a cross between portraits and a fashion show; and the politically charged series "Hitler Moves East", "Mein Kampf" and "Blackface". This latter series consists of close-ups of black memorabilia, household objects infused with African-American stereotypes, and caused such a controversy that the Institute of Contemporary Art of Philadelphia was forced to cancel the exhibition while still in its early planning stages. Most of Levinthalâs series stem from his experiences as a child with popular culture. His early encounters with his familyâs color television in contrast with daily reality have also marked his work. The subjects of Levinthalâs work, the toys and dolls themselves, are often confused with real live people, causing his audience to question the ambiguity found in this dialectic between artificiality and reality.
With the use of skilled photography, Levinthal animates his small toys, sometimes to the point of artificially created movement. On his toy use, Levinthal said that "Toys are intriguing, and I want to see what I can do with them. On a deeper level, they represent one way that society socializes its young."
Furthermore, Levinthal is aware of the power of toys: âEver since I began working with toys, I have been intrigued with the idea that these seemingly benign objects could take on such incredible power and personality simply by the way they were photographed. I began to realize that by carefully selecting the depth of field and making it narrow, I could create a sense of movement and reality that was in fact not there.

Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival

The Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival is a regional, nonprofit theater company that performs works by William Shakespeare (and others) at Boscobel in Garrison, NY. The company also runs several education programs.
History.
A 1987 performance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" which was held as a fundraiser for Manitoga, the Garrison home of industrial designer Russell Wright, served as inspiration for the festival. It was produced by Melissa Stern Lourie in cooperation with the Twenty-Ninth Street Project, and directed by Terrence O'Brien. O'Brien and Lourie decided to found an annual festival. Since 1988, the festival has performed at the Boscobel Restoration in Garrison, New York.
The Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival was the subject of a one hour documentary and two hour film of a performance of Twelfth Night which premiered on the PBS affiliate WNET (Channel 13 in New York City) on September 18, 2008. The program has aired since then on WLIW (Channel 21 on Long Island) and is scheduled for broadcast on a number of PBS affiliates in the region.
Location.
With its plays performed in an open air location, the grounds of the Boscobel Restoration in Garrison, NY, the festival is known for its beautiful backdrop. The stage, a rough patch of dirt that is on the same level as the first few rows of the audience, recedes into lawns with "breathtaking vistas" of the Hudson River and West Point in the distance. The company uses the vast open space behind the stage as a prop for the plays. According to Ben Brantley of The New York Times, "nature and Shakespeare are the stars" in this festival.
Recognition.
It produces classic works with an economy of style, focusing on script, actors and audience with the Hudson River and Hudson Highlands as its set and setting. The Wall Street Journal hails it as, "The most purely enjoyable summer Shakespeare festival in America," while The New York Times comments, "If anyone wonders about the future of live theater or asks where the audience is, the answer is 'Under that tent."
It is listed as a Major Festival in the book "Shakespeare Festivals Around the World" by Marcus D. Gregio (Editor), 2004.
Education Programs.
In addition to its summer productions, the Festival sponsors year-round education programs that reach over 35,000 students annually from elementary school through college. These programs include Access-Shakespeare, a fully staged touring production; Shakespeare Students on Stage, and Free Will, an artists-in-residence program; and the Teaching Shakespeare Summer Institute. In addition, the Festival runs a summer Apprentice Program for a select group of college-age actors who are seriously committed to pursuing professional careers in acting.

Japan National Route 283

Description.
Route 283 almost exactly parallels the JR Kamaishi Line its entire length. Through Hanamaki and Tono, 283 follows the Sarugaishi River, then from downtown Tono to Sennin Toge Pass it parallels the Hayase River. In Kamaishi, it follows the Kasshi River. The Kamaishi Expressway, when finished, will provide a faster alternative for those travelling longer distances.
Route 283 travels mostly through rural countryside connecting Hanamaki, Hanamaki Airport, Towa, Lake Tase, Miyamori, Tono and Kamaishi. The flat plains of eastern Hanamaki rise to the gently rolling hills of the Kitakami Range which then give way to the plains of Tono. There are two Road Stations in Tono along Route 283, one in Miyamori and Kaze no Oka in Ayaori. 
The only tunnel on the route is at Sennin Toge Pass. It is about two-and-a-half kilometers in length. Despite the pass, the road in Kamaishi is quite contorted at the higher elevations. Near the western entrance to the tunnel there are shallow limestone caves that produce ice formations resembling stalactites and stalagmites in winter. In the hills above RikuchÅ«-Åhashi Station in Kamaishi, there was a Japanese prisoner of war camp for a short time before the end of World War II.
Intersections.
In Hanamaki, National Route 456 ends at Route 283 in Towa next to JR Tsuchizawa Station. 456 leads south through Esashi Ward of Oshu City then Daito and Senmaya in Ichinoseki City before crossing into Miyagi Prefecture. Prefectural Roads 178 and 161 meet just north of JR Miyamori Station. 178 leads south across the Tase Dam, circles Lake Tase and ends at National Route 107.
In Tono, Prefectural Roads 178 and 161 join 283 just northwest of Miyamori Station. To the south 178 crosses Lake Tase Dam and circles around Lake Tase before intersecting National Route 107. National Route 107 joins 283 at the tail end of Lake Tase just to the west of Kashiwagidaira Station, follows 283 for some three kilometers before going south to Sumida Town at Masuzawa Station. National Route 396 ends at Route 283 in Tono just a kilometer and a half west of the Kaze no Oka Road Station. It leads to the North through Miyamori, Ohasama and on to Morioka. National Route 340 joins 283 next to Tono Hospital and the two routes combine for nearly nine kilometers before 340 branches off to the south at Iwate-KamigÅ Station. North 340 leads to Kawaii Village, Kuzumaki Town, Kunohe Village, and on to Hachinohe in Aomori Prefecture. To the south, 340 leads to Sumida Town and Rikuzen Takata City.

At present, work is underway to complete an central section that will join the eastern and western portions together through the very northern part of the Japanese Alps on Niigata's and Fukushima's prefectural border.
When finished, traffic will be able to travel coast to coast across Japan in a link between the Sea of Japan and Pacific. 
Sections.
Niigata.
The western part of Route 289 begins in Yoshida passing east through the towns of Tsubame and Sanjo. It currently ends in the mountains 10Â km south east of Shitada village.
Fukushima.
The eastern part of Route 289 starts in Iwaki, Fukushima near Nakoso Station. It then heads west through Shirakawa and passed Shinshirakawa. It currently ends 12Â km north west of NishigÅ village.
Central part.
Work to join the east and west sections began in 1999. But the scheme suffered a major setback after the ChÅ«etsu earthquake in 2004 when landslips covered large parts of the route. In 2005/06 efforts were made to clear these blockages and restart building work.
The finished route, which presently is a dirt track and is only passable by 4x4s or construction traffic, will include several spanned bridges, avalanche covers and a 1.5Â km tunnel.
A provisional completion date has been given as 2012.

Ghosts Before Breakfast

Ghosts Before Breakfast () is a 1928 German dadaist animated short film directed by Hans Richter. It utilizes stop motion for some of its effect and live action for others. The film does not present a coherent narrative, and includes a number of seemingly arbitrary images. The original soundtrack, written by Paul Hindemith, was destroyed by the Nazis, but new audio tracks have been created by artists such as The Real Tuesday Weld. British composer Ian Gardiner, who has written many scores for cinema and television, created a score for the film in 2006 (premiered by the Liverpool group Ensemble 10/10, directed by Clark Rundell). UK-based American composer Jean Hasse (Visible Music) wrote a score in 2008 for the UK-based ensemble Counterpoise (violin, trumpet, alto sax, piano).

Jaw coupling

A jaw coupling is a type of motion control (servo) coupling designed to transmit torque (by connecting two shafts) while damping system vibrations, which protects other components from damage. Jaw couplings are composed of three parts: two metallic hubs and an elastomer insert called an element, but commonly referred to as a "spider". The three parts press fit together with a jaw from each hub fitted alternately with the lobes of the spider. The curved jaws of the hubs reduce deformation of the spider to maintain the zero-backlash fit.
The elastomer of the spider can be made in different hardnesses, which allows the user to customize the coupling so that it absorbs more or less vibration. The more damping ability the coupling has, the less torsional strength it possesses. Jaw couplings are best suited for applications that rely on a stop-and-go type of movement, where accuracy needs to take place upon stopping in order to perform any number of precision tasks, such as taking a high resolution picture (machine vision system). Absorbing vibrations decreases the settling time the system needs, which increases through-put. The jaw coupling is less suited for applications that rely on a constant scanning type of motion, where accuracy is required "during" movement, which requires a torsionally stronger coupling. 
The drawback of the jaw coupling is the lack of misalignment capability. Too much axial motion will cause the coupling to come apart, while too much angular or parallel misalignment will result in bearing loads that are higher than most other servo/motion control couplings. Jaw couplings are also considered fail-safe. If the spider fails, the jaws of the two hubs will mate, much like teeth on two gears, and continue to transmit torque. This may or may not be desirable to the user depending on the application. 
Jaw couplings are well balanced and able to tolerate high RPM. With its damping capability and interchangeable spiders, jaw couplings make a great solution for shock absorption.

Harwich Force

The Harwich Force was a squadron of the Royal Navy, formed during the First World War and based in Harwich. It played a significant role in the war.
History.
After the outbreak of the First World War, a priority for the Royal Navy was to secure the approaches to the English Channel, to prevent elements of the German High Seas Fleet from breaking out into the Atlantic, or from interfering with British maritime trade and convoys to the continent. Most of the major fleet units of the Grand Fleet had dispersed to the navy's anchorage at Scapa Flow or to other North Eastern ports to monitor the northern route from the North Sea into the Atlantic. Consequently, a number of patrol flotillas were organised along the south and east coasts of England, with commands established at several of the major ports in the region. The Dover Patrol was based at Dover, consisting mostly of destroyers, while a number of pre-dreadnoughts and cruisers were based at Portland Harbour. A large number of destroyers, flotilla leaders and light cruisers were centred at Harwich, under the command of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt.
Composition.
The Harwich Force consisted of between four and eight light cruisers, several flotilla leaders and usually between 30 and 40 destroyers, with numbers fluctuating throughout the war, and organised into flotillas. Also stationed at Harwich was a submarine force under Commodore Roger Keyes.
In early 1917, the Harwich Force consisted of eight light cruisers, two flotilla leaders and 45 destroyers. By the end of the year, there were nine light cruisers, four flotilla leaders and 24 destroyers. The combination of light, fast ships was intended to provide effective scouting and reconnaissance, whilst still being able to engage German light forces, and to frustrate attempts at minelaying in the Channel.
Service.
It was intended that the Harwich Force would operate when possible in conjunction with the Dover Patrol, and the Admiralty intended that the Harwich force would also be able to support the Grand Fleet if it moved into the area. Tyrwhitt was also expected to carry out reconnaissance of German naval activities in the southern parts of the North Sea, and to escort ships sailing between the Thames and the Netherlands. Tyrwhitt's objectives were often complicated by the need to provide reinforcements for the Dover Patrol. The force fired the first shots of the war when a flotilla led by sank the minelayer on 5 August 1914. During the war, the Force captured or sank 24 enemy merchants, and it escorted 520 eastbound and 511 westbound ships between Dutch and British ports. Their ships also took part in the Cuxhaven Raid on Christmas Day, 1914.
The force was also active in a number of clashes with the "Kaiserliche Marine" (German Navy). Their ships were present at the Battles of Heligoland Bight, Texel, and Dogger Bank, and were mobilised after the German raids on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in 1914, and on Yarmouth and Lowestoft in 1916. They were called out during the lead up to the Battle of Jutland, but did not take part in the battle. After the end of the war, Harwich was designated the port at which the remaining German U-boats would be surrendered, and Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force oversaw the operation.
Battle of Jutland.
At the end of May 1916, at the time of the Battle of Jutland, the Harwich force consisted of:
During the battle, the Harwich Force sortied to join the Grand Fleet on the initiative of Commodore Trywhitt early on 1 June 1916 (although the force was recalled by the Admiralty a few hours later). The following ships were involved:

Battle of Yangcheng

The Battle of Yangcheng was a battle fought between the warlords Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu as the coalition against Dong Zhuo fell apart in 191 in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Sun Jian, Yuan Shu's nominal subordinate returning from his triumphant capture of the abandoned capital of Luoyang, became involved in Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu's personal feud as the former allies turned against one another. Yuan Shao's forces, under Zhou Yu, first got an upper hand against Sun Jian's forces, but was beaten back by Sun's counterattack.
Background.
In 190, regional warlords and officials from across China formed a coalition against Chancellor of State Dong Zhuo, who controlled state power and held Emperor Xian hostage. Yuan Shao was elected leader of the alliance. To participate in the campaign against Dong Zhuo, Sun Jian led an army north to join Yuan Shu, who was part of the coalition. Yuan Shu appointed Sun Jian as Acting General Who Smashes the Caitiffs (ç ´èå°è») and Inspector of Yu Province (è±«å·åºå²), and sent him to attack Dong Zhuo at the capital city of Luoyang. Sun Jian defeated Dong Zhuo's forces, causing Dong to set fire to Luoyang and force its people to move to Chang'an, where the new capital was situated. Sun Jian's capture of Luoyang, in ruins, was militarily untenable since the other members of the alliance had no mind to reinforce his position, while they themselves were on the verge of dissolution. Sun abandoned Luoyang and made his way back south.
Yuan Shu, apparently dissatisfied that his cousin Yuan Shao was elected coalition leader and received all the prestige that came with his appointment, insulted his cousin as "a family slave" and "not a true son of the Yuan clan". Yuan Shao was predictably angry at this. In 191, he named Zhou Yu (Renming) as Inspector of Yu Province, a title to which Sun Jian was entitled, and sent him to attack Sun's territories in Yu Province while Sun was away.
Zhou Yu decided to attack Yangcheng of Yingchuan Commandery (æ½å·; southeast of present-day Dengfeng, Henan). Originally, an outpost was set up here by Sun Jian during his march north against Dong Zhuo, and the outpost remained to watch for possible attacks from Dong Zhuo from the west after Sun Jian left Luoyang. Although the city of Yangcheng belonged under Sun Jian's government in Yu Province, it was also within Yuan Shao's sphere of influence in Ji Province (åå·), and thus it was a sensible target for Yuan's aggression.
The battle.
Not expecting an attack from a nominal ally, Yangcheng was taken by surprise. When Sun Jian heard of the attack, he sighed and commented:
The northern warlord Gongsun Zan sided with Yuan Shu, and sent his cousin Gongsun Yue with a 1,000 horsemen to Yuan Shu. Gongsun Yue and his horsemen were to accompany Sun Jian in the battle to retake Yangcheng, but in the initial skirmishes Gongsun Yue was killed by an arrow. Despite the setbacks, Sun Jian recovered some time later and defeated Zhou Yu in several battles. Then Yuan Shu led an attack southeast on Zhou Yu's brother Zhou Ang in Jiujiang, which compelled Zhou Yu to abandon Yangcheng to go to his brother's aid. There Zhou Yu was defeated again, and he abandoned the campaign to return to his hometown of Kuaiji.
Aftermath.
The first battles between Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu ended in the latter's favour: he had engaged and defeated Yuan Shao's forces in both Yangcheng and Jiujiang, restored the position in Yingchuan under Sun Jian, and eliminated Zhou Yu's as a threat once and for all although Jiujiang was not yet conquered. For Yuan Shao, on the other hand, the situation was extremely difficult: besides the failure in the south, he was also under threat from Gongsun Zan, who held Yuan Shao responsible for the death of Gongsun Yue and declared war against him, rejecting all of Yuan Shao's protestations of goodwill. This led to the clash between Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan in the Battle of Jieqiao.
The battle of Yangcheng, being the first moves in the struggle between the two Yuans, marked the beginning of a new stage in the confusion of wars which brought the end of the Han Dynasty. The battle was notable as a confirmation of the death of the alliance against Dong Zhuo as the warlords of the North China Plain start to battle each other for the ultimate dominion of China.

Florida Railroad

The Florida Railroad was the first railroad to connect the east and west coasts of Florida, running from Fernandina to Cedar Key. The line later became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and, where still in use, is operated by CSX Transportation and the First Coast Railroad. The highway corridor of SR 24, US 301, and SR A1A closely parallels the former Florida Railroad.
History.
The water route between the east coast and gulf coast of the United States passes through the Straits of Florida, close to the Florida Reef that lies just off the Florida Keys. Prior to the 20th century many ships were wrecked around the southern end of the Florida peninsula. A railroad across the northern end of the Florida peninsula would allow cargoes from ships in the Gulf of Mexico to be transferred to ships in the Atlantic Ocean, and vice-versa, without the risk of passage through the Straits of Florida, while cutting 800 miles off the trip.
In 1842 the United States Congress commissioned a survey of a route for a railroad between the St. Mary's River and Cedar Key in the Territory of Florida. In 1853 the Florida Legislature chartered the Florida Railroad to build a rail line from Fernandina (near the mouth of the St. Mary's River) to Tampa, Florida, with a branch to Cedar Key. The president and chief stockholder of the Florida Railroad was U.S. Senator David Levy Yulee. Yulee decided to complete the line to Cedar Key first, leaving the connection to Tampa for later. Construction started in Fernandina in 1855. By 1858 the rail line was open between Fernandina and Palatka, but the Panic of 1857 had left the railroad on the edge of bankruptcy. Yulee had to surrender a majority interest in the railroad to a northern investment syndicate headed by Edward Dickerson to save the company. The line was completed to Cedar Key in 1860. At 156 miles in length, it was the longest railroad to be completed in Florida before the start of the American Civil War. 
The Florida Railroad was adversely affected by the Civil War. The USS "Hatteras" raided Cedar Key in January 1862, destroying the railroad's rolling stock and buildings. In March 1862 a Union squadron seized Fernandina. Shells fired by the USS "Ottawa" damaged the last train leaving Fernandina, killing or injuring several passengers, and almost killing Senator Yulee. In 1864, the Confederate States Army pulled up rails from the Florida Railroad to use on a new rail line from Live Oak, Florida to Lawton, Georgia. Union forces had also destroyed 30 miles of track leading from Cedar Key.
The Dickerson syndicate resumed operation of the Florida Railroad after the war, but with much of the railroad's equipment, facilities and track destroyed or seized, the company did not do well, and defaulted on its bonds to the Internal Improvement Fund in 1866. The railroad was auctioned off, and bought back by the Dickerson syndicate for twenty percent of the original value of the bonds. In 1872 the Florida Railroad was reorganized as the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company, still under the control of the Dickerson syndicate. The newly reorganized company began construction of the long-promised line to Tampa through subsidiary companies: the Peninsular Railroad operated the line from the connection with the Florida Railroad at Waldo to Ocala and Silver Springs, while the Tropical Florida Railroad ran from Ocala to Wildwood. In the meantime, the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company had leased the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, providing a connection from its tracks at Hart's Road (later Yulee, Florida) to Jacksonville, Florida. Due to financial difficulties, the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company was reorganized as the Florida Transit Company in 1881, under the control of Sir Edward James Reed. The company was restructured again as the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad in 1883. 
The Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad was merged with the Florida Central and Western Railroad, Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad and Leesburg and Indian River Railroad in 1884-85 to form the Florida Railway and Navigation Company.

Royal Spring Park

Royal Spring Park is the site of a large spring in Georgetown, Kentucky that since the earliest settlements in the area has provided water for the area. In addition to the spring, the park has a log cabin built by a former slave, Milton Leach. The park was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on April 2, 1973.
History.
Royal Spring.
Royal Spring is a large spring in Georgetown, Kentucky that has been a main source of water since the first settlements in the area. In 1889, the Georgetown Water Works Company was incorporated, and distributed the spring water until the City of Georgetown purchased that company and established the Municipal Water Works Plant in 1945. Currently, more than 8,000 customers of Georgetown Municipal Water and Sewer Service rely on water from the spring as their primary water supply.
Early settlements.
In 1774 John Floyd of Fincastle County, Virginia led a surveying party into Kentucky to locate land to be used as "compensation for soldier in the French and Indian War". On July 7, 1774, Floyd found the spring and he received it and of land as payment for his surveying work. This spring's earliest know name was "Mr. Floyd's Spring". In October 1775, Floyd transferred ownership of the spring to John McClelland (1745â1776), from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, after McClelland surveyed and built a cabin on the land earlier in the year. In 1776 McClelland's Fort, an army outpost was built on a nearby cliff to have close proximity to the spring. The fort was abandoned in 1777 after the Indian attacks increased in frequency and severity.
Kentucky Bourbon developed.
Baptist preacher Elijah Craig set up a grain mill and used the spring water to first distill bourbon whiskey using the sour mash process on this site in 1789. Craig has long been credited with the creation of bourbon though more recent research suggests alternative explanations.
Royal Spring Park.
Royal Spring Park, located off West Main Street (U.S. Route 460) in the downtown area, features an outdoor recreation area, viewing of Royal Spring, and an authentic restored log cabin museum. The site has several historical markers and monuments that give tribute to the spring, early settlers, and local war heroes.
The park was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on April 2, 1973.
Leach Cabin.
In 1874, Milton Leach, a former slave, built a log cabin to use as his dwelling. The log cabin was restored and relocated to Royal Spring Park to serve as a museum.

Sandhikharka

Sandhikharka () is the headquarters of Arghakhanchi District in the Lumbini Zone of Nepal. It is located in a western part of Nepal's capital of Kathmandu. Due to a high literacy rate, Sandhikharka has attracted people from outside Arghakhanchi District to Sandhikharka for its good schools. The town had been the subject of several attacks between the Nepali government and Maoist rebels during the civil war.
Geography.
Sandhikharka also known as Sandhikharka Municipality" is a beautiful valley and the headquarter of Arghakhanchi district. Its lies in Lumbini zone, Nepal. It is situated between two famous mountains Argha and Khanchi on which the district name itself is created. In a recent years Sandhikharka has shown a significant progress in many things such as expansion of roads almost in all corners, training people through various national and International non-governmental organisation, engaging people in various activities. Although Sandhikharka is a small town but people here are highly educated and it has produced one of the finest scholars and individuals in the country. In recent years the migration of many graduates towards the developed countries such as USA, Britain, Ireland,Australia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Spain have increased a lot which has resulted a huge amount of migration rate, but the same migrants are the ones who have made this town one of the best place to live in Nepal. By sending their hard earned money from abroad, the people living in a foreign land have played the most significant role to make this town advanced enough to compete with any other town or city in Nepal. Similar to other parts of Nepal the politicians do play dirty games here too.Unfortunately Arghakhanchians are also greatly influenced by the opportunist parties and their leaders. Many people support parties for their personal benefit while others are taking a shelter of Maoist (the past branded terrorist who ruined Nepal from every single corner) group just to protect themselves from their wrongdoing in the past. It is located southwest of Nepal's capital of Kathmandu. Three small rivers; Bangi river, Ghoche river and Bhadri river are merging at Chutrabeshi, a next part of Snadhikharka. Therefore peoples sometimes use to say Tribeni of Arghakhanchi district. However, only one pitched road that connect to national highway at Gorusinghe. There are many gravel roads constructed from Sandhikharka to many villages of the Arghakhanchi district.
Sandhikharka located around 960 meter above from mean sea level. Climatic condition of the Sandhikharka is normal type. During the summer season, maximum temperature reaches about 37 degree while in the winter season it goes in between 1-10 degree Celsius. The number of rainy days in summer are higher. Winter season normally dry and cold and sometimes, snow covers in the surrounding mountains of Sandhikharka.
History.
Background.
More than 300 years ago, this place was not a good place for peoples of surrounding village. Peoples used to say it "Kharka" and visit there only for farming purpose due to large numbers of farming fields and good natural water supply. Nobody wanted to stay in the night there because peoples of the district believed that this area is the homeland of Ghost. Another interesting thing is that this area was a broader of two small kingdom i.e. Argha and Khanchi during Chaubisi rajya (24 principalities) or before uniting Nepal. Peoples of the two kingdom used to do fight each other for their interest. Finally, they decided to make peace and made a kind of hidden treaty at the Kharka. Afterward, peoples used to say it Sandhikharka i.e.( Sandhi=treaty and Kharka = Bare and farm land & residence of domestic animals). 
During new government system of Nepal(2024B.S.),Khanchi village, next to Sandhikharka VDC was the headquarter of the Arghakhanchi district at the first time so that Sandhikharka was not so popular to peoples of the district. Due to effort of some local peoples of Sandhikharka area, Nepal government decided to shift headquarters in Sandhikharka after 2030B.S. Since, then, It has becoming popular not only to district but also in Lumbini Zone.
2002 Maoist attacks.
On September 8, 2002, the town was involved in a massive battle between the government forces and "thousands" of Maoists, reportedly led by Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and Pampha Bhusal who come from the district. Heavily armed rebels engaged the bases of civilian police, armed police and the Royal Nepalese Army and overpowered them following a few hours of gunbattle. They torched
all government buildings except the hospital, most never being rebuilt. About 50 policemen and 70 rebels were killed in the night-long battle, with almost 36 police injured. However, doubts remain over how many of the dead were actually Maoists. A second attack was launched on September 10, 2002, in which guerillas killed at least 65 security personnel, including soldiers, through 12 hours of fighting. Forty-one personnel were reported as injured in this attack. A telecommunication tower was destroyed as a result of the second attack, and reinforcements were rushed in by helicopter as well as a government-sponsored effort to hold the town. Unnamed leaders said lack of communication and a failed response from authorities led to the government's defeats. CNN speculated that these attacks were aimed at disrupting the upcoming election by forcing the Nepali government to impose a state of emergency.
Aftermath and government attack.
Following the attacks, all the political parties were hounded out, and the Nepali government left Sandhikharka other than operating security forces and the post office. However, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba visited the town on September 11, who expressed his surprise to see this level of damage and destruction. The rebels freed 60 people abducted after the attack that day. Attempting to flee, government troops blocked an exit route from Arghakhanchi district, killing 13 guerillas.
2005 Maoist attack.
Maoists launched a third attack on March 4, 2005. This operation backfired, and the Nepali military killed 30 Maoists in what BBC called "one of the bloodiest clashes since the royal coup." There were no casualties of troops. After forcing rebels into retreat, the military recovered "some crude bombs, terrorist documents and equipment used to operate mines". Despite his military's success, King Gyanendra of Nepal imposed a state of emergency, detained political party leaders and imposed censorship of the press. Nepal's military released a statement on the fighting:
Demographics.
At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 8921. It had 6703 married people, with 185 having more than one spouse as of that census. Sandhikharka had 7706 literate people, and 2272 were attending school as of that census. This high literacy rate once drew people from outside Arghakhanchi District to Sandhikharka for its good schools.
Education.
The Shree Janajyoti Higher Secondary School in Sandhikharka was established in 1963, one of the oldest school in the District. This school is famous for providing high-level science in Arghakhanchi district. Mr. Janga Bahadur P.C. is the principal of the school since 2007. Recently, two new buildings have constructed to expand more classrooms and practical lab rooms for science and other programs. Financial support was partially funded by the government of India for one building. Currently, Plus two programs including science, commerce and education are running at the school. Due to high level education system in this school, students from neighbouring districts are coming to study every year. Nevertheless, the number of students in the school is always within the range of 1000 every year. The first English boarding school was Tribeni English Boarding school in Chutrabesi Sandhikharkha which was establshed on 1981 by Indra Gopal .After successfully running for few years this school shut down its operation due to some poor management problems. Later some existing members of Tribeni school formed another great school called Himali Children Academy which produced a very talented scholars. Recently (with the figure of 2014)Gauri Shankar English Boarding school owned by Ganesh Chettri have successfully being recognised a quality education provider competing another genius school Sandhikharka higher secondary boarding School. Panini Multiple College is the first and oldest college affiliated by Tribhuvan university in this district the founder principal of this college was Mr. Gyan Hari Acharya and current principal is Mr. Gyan Bahadur Chhetri since 2009. Many graduate and undergraduate courses are running in the college. Therefore, number of students always higher. Broad of the college is planning to run master course in coming days.
Closure of schools.
In October 2004, the Maoists ordered the closure of all private schools in Sandhikharka, as well as the rest of Arghakhanchi District. This came a year after they promised to keep the schools open if the cut their tuition costs by at least 20 percent, which was what occurred. According to schoolchild Pratiba Acharya, "Maoists thought that only rich people study in boarding schools like mine, so they want to close them." Further, they destroyed schools who were operated by their enemies and those they disagreed with, after trying to change their curricula was to no avail. Many students were sent to public schools, which teach in Nepali. This posed two problems. For one thing, Nepali, though widely spoken and understood, is not invariably the mother tongue of all students in multilingual, multi-ethnic Nepal. In addition, private school students are accustomed to English as the primary medium of instruction.
Government.
The purpose of Village Development Committees is to organise village people structurally at a local level and creating a partnership between the community and the public sector for improved service delivery system. A VDC has a status as an autonomous institution and authority for interacting with the more centralised institutions of governance in Nepal. In doing so, the VDC gives village people an element of control and responsibility in development, and also ensures proper utilization and distribution of state funds and a greater interaction between government officials, NGOs and agencies. The village development committees within a given area will discuss education, water supply, basic health, sanitation and income and will also monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.
In VDCs there is one elected chief, usually elected with over an 80% majority. From each ward, there is also a chief that is elected along with these there are also four members elected or nominated.
Media.
To Promote local culture Sandhikharka has one FM radio station Radio Arghakhanchi - 105.8Â MHz Which is a Community radio Station.

Malaysian All-Star League Baseball

Malaysian All-Star League Baseball (MALB) is a baseball league open to all baseball clubs and associations in Malaysia. The league's operations and management are modeled on the US major leagues (MLB). It is the only sport's league in the world that has men and women playing side by side, and against each other.[http://malbaseball.wordpress.com/about-malb/]
Baseball development in Malaysia and in the South East Asian region.
Baseball was introduced to Malaysia in the mid-1970s when several US based corporations, including Texas Instruments and Smith Kline Beecham, began manufacturing operations in the Keramat Industrial Park in Kuala Lumpur. Most of the plants in operation at the time had a substantial number of American expatriates attached to them, who formally introduced baseball to the Malaysian locals through slow-pitch, fast-pitch and rounder games.
Softball was introduced to Malaysia in the early 1980s, but the game spread more rapidly than baseball, becoming popular in the northern regions of Pulau Pinang, Kedah and Perak, the southern regions of Johor, Melaka and Negeri Sembilan, the eastern regions of Sabah & Sarawak and the East Coast regions of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang. It was only in 2001 that baseball formed the Persatuan Besbol Amatur Malaysia, or the Amateur Baseball Association of Malaysia, was formed under founding President Dato' Noh Abdullah.
MALB History.
The idea of creating a formal baseball league in Malaysia was first conceptualized in 2005 by two clubs based in Kuala Lumpur, the All-Stars Baseball Club and the Selayang Stars Baseball Club. A formal league was envisioned as a way to provide serious baseball players in Malaysia the opportunity to compete at a more professional level.
The inaugural MALB game was held on February 23, 2006 between Selayang Stars and the Aces of Kepong at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysiaâs field in Bangi. An inaugural five-month season ensued using a double round-robin format, followed by playoffs. The Patriots Baseball Club, based in Bangsar, a neighborhood of Kuala Lumpur, won the championship in both 2006 and 2007. Each club that joins the MALB must pay participation fees RM600 to RM800 ($180â$240) per team for each season.
For the 2008 season, the MALB restructured the playoffs to include the MALB Asean Series. Under the revised format, the top two teams from the MALB face four other international teams in a tournament culminating in the MALB Asean Series Grand Final. The MALB Asean Series represented a commitment by the MALB organization to develop and promote baseball throughout South East Asian. The MALB has sought to strengthen ties with baseball associations from Asean countries: in 2008, the MALB established a working relationship with the Singapore Baseball & Softball Association, through its Secretary General, Abdu Aziz Talib, and the Garuda Baseball Club of Jakarta, Indonesia.

Ekoi mythology

The primary traditional Ekoi deities are Obassi Osaw, the sky god, and Obassi Nsi, the earth god, similar to the Efik. Ancestors and natural forces are also emphasized in Ekoi worship. Various Ekoi cults are devoted to the welfare of common activities, such as farming. Before the establishment of British colonial administration, the egbo was a prominent Ekoi secret society that had strong social regulatory functions as well as influence in religious matters. Members of the egbo used a form of ideographic writing called nsibidi, variations of which were formerly found among other ethnic groups in southeastern Nigeria.
The Ekoi practice traditional medicine and have treated such diseases as smallpox with local medicinal plants. In addition to displaying an extensive knowledge of and aesthetic appreciation for flowers, the Ekoi create mural paintings on sanctuaries, make pottery, and carve figures in solid basaltic blocks. They are also known for their large, skin-covered masks.

Hector Giacomelli

Hector Giacomelli, born in Paris on April 1, 1822 and died in Menton on December 1, 1904. He was a French watercolorist, engraver and illustrator, best known for his paintings of birds. 
Biography.
His Italian father, a professor of singing, was first an engraver before becoming an industrial designer for a jeweler. 
But when he was 30 years old, a serious illness forces him to go away from Paris. He then started to draw and paint plants, insects and birds around his new and spectacular house. Making lots of money in Paris, he developed a passion for the work of Auguste Raffet, which he published the catalog "racist" in 1862. He worked with Gustave DorÃ©, for which he composed ornaments like "The Holy Bible according to the Vulgate", published in 1866. He contributed drawings to several newspapers, such as "Le Monde illustrÃ©", "Le Magasin pittoresque", and "L'Illustration". He also privately illustrated books that brought him wealthy bibliophiles. He was one of the organizers of the exposition of the century prints of 1887 and Section retrospective of Fine Arts, and the Universal Paris Exposition of 1889. 
Illustrating on top of other artists like Jules Michelet, AndrÃ© Theuriet FranÃ§ois CoppÃ©e and Alfred de Musset, Giacomelli also became a renowned collector.

<doc id="18570442" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18570442" title="Schola Castra Nova Equitum Singularium">
Schola Castra Nova Equitum Singularium

The Schola of the Castra Nova Equitum Singularium was a meeting room/office of the "curatores" from the mounted bodyguard of the Emperor found within the remains of the headquarters of the "Castra Nova" ('New Camp') beneath the Basilica San Giovanni in Laterano.
Excavations.
Archaeological excavations beneath San Giovanni in Laterano in 1934â1938 uncovered part of the "principia" of the "castra nova" (new fort) of the Equites singulares Augusti. The building was square in shape and was fronted by a portico on the north side, creating a monumental faÃ§ade that lead directly into the central courtyard. A rear range with the aedes at its centre occupied the southern end and short wings of two or three rooms formed the east and west sides. The room forming the northern end of the east wing could be identified as the "schola curatorum" by the inscription found "in situ" within, recording the consecration of the "schola" on January 1 AD 197. The inscription was incised on an inverted ionic capital, found lying beside a column of African granite that rose above ground level by 75Â cm, with a foundation depth of 48Â cm. That the capital and column were connected seems certain, particularly as the column supports the capital perfectly.
On the plan prepared by Gismondi and published by Colini the room where the inscription was found contains the letter Îµ (p344 Fig 284), but this is only a label for the room and there is no indication as to where within it the inscription was actually discovered. Spinola, however argued that the location of the monument within this room was coincidental, being simply a side room to which outdated and unwanted inscriptions could be relegated. Instead he suggested that the inscription originally came from the aedes on the grounds that a dedication to the imperial cult would be more appropriately housed there. This hypothesis is not plausible, as dedications by military collegia to the domus divina occur in rooms throughout the "principia" at Lambaesis. This shows that monuments set up by individual associations were usually located in their own private space, rather than in a communal area. 
The room measured 7 meters long and 4.60 meters wide, with a doorway slightly off-centre in the west wall, 1.80 meters wide. There is no evidence for any other structural features or architectural embellishments to the room and the niche reported by Speidel is a result of his misunderstanding of Josiâs report. Josi in describing the door into the "schola" states that it is "Ã¨ posta quasi al centro della parete che guarda lâabside." This does not mean, as Speidel is believed to have translated it, that the doorway was in the wall opposite an apse. Rather, Josi is referring to the apse of the cathedral above, as throughout his report he relates his discoveries to the features of the Basilica San Giovanni, which were at the time clearly visible to him. Following this interpretation the doorway is indeed in the wall that faced the apse of the basilica, so that his observation was not referring to the schola at all. Certainly it is difficult to identify any structural feature altering the rectangular aspect of the room in any of the excavation photographs or from visiting the remains today.
Part of the wall decoration survives as plaster painted dark red with a geometric pattern marked out in thin white lines. The frescoes are badly damaged and survive only to about two meters in height, with the lower footings missing and the upper destruction level roughly even, though irregular. The only discernible decorative element appears as three white lines rising vertically, with the outer two lines then turning at opposing right angles to form the horizontal upper edge of a rectangular panel. The fresco, along with the remains of the principia itself, were destroyed only a few feet above the floor level. The dating of the fresco is also uncertain, though it reflects a general scheme visible in the other rooms, of geometric patterns in white picked out on a dark red background.
There is no evidence for the floor and it must have consisted of materials that were able to be recycled prior to its demolition. The column and capital may have acted as an altar, comparable to an example of an ionic capital employed in such a way at the mithraeum of the domus on Via Giovanni Lanza. Speidel suggested it could have once supported a statue of Minerva, more likely Minerva Augusta as the dedication to the goddess contained in the text suggests. Spinola argues against this view, noting that there is no sign on the surface of the capital of dowel-holes by which the statue could be securely attached. These, however, may have been unnecessary as the statue would have been placed on a firm broad base in safe location. In general, the schola of the curatores indicates that a functional room could easily be adapted to the purposes of a schola without causing any radical change in its nature, nor, it follows, does it need to identify itself as a schola by adopting any obvious structural indications of this role.

One of the more controversial such listings occurred on April 15, 2008. NBA star Carmelo Anthony was arrested and charged with DUI on Interstate 25. The next day Anthony issued his first apology for the arrest through his Yardbarker blog expressing remorse to both his teammates and his fans for his behavior.
Another notable example would be in January 2008, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb used his blog on Yardbarker to lay out his vision for the coming season after the Eagles poor showing in the 2007 NFL season.
Atlanta Falcons FB Ovie Mughelli leveraged the Yardbarker community for his nickname via a contest.
