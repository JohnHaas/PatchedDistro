Average order of an arithmetic function

In number theory, an average order of an arithmetic function is some simpler or better-understood function which takes the same values "on average".
Let "f" be an arithmetic function. We say that an "average order" of "f" is "g" if
as "x" tends to infinity.
It is conventional to choose an approximating function "g" that is continuous and monotone. But even thus an average order is of course not unique. 
Better average order.
This notion is best discussed through an example. From
(formula_3 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant) and
we have the asymptotic relation
which suggests that the function formula_6 is a better choice of average order for formula_7 than simply formula_8.

Johnstown Christian School

Johnstown Christian School is a parochial school in Hollsopple, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1944 by a group of Mennonite families who were concerned about the spiritual growth and development of their children. The school was reorganized in 1973 as the Johnstown Christian School to better reflect the broader Christian community of the Johnstown area that was being served. The school serves children in kindergarten through 12th grade.
Mission.
Johnstown Christian School provides Christian families with a Christ-centered education which prepares their children spiritually, academically, and socially to live for the glory of God.
Students will be prepared spiritually in their commitment to Christ and their development of a Christian world and life view, academically with a quality curriculum, and socially through the development of Godly character traits.
Campus.
The Holsopple campus is located in the Davidsville-Holsopple area of Somerset County, about two miles from Conemaugh Township High School. The school facilities include:
One popular campus area is the soccer field and upper parking lot area. Flanked by archaic trees, the rural Soap Hollow neighborhood, and the school gymnasium, the area serves as a location for high school and middle school students to congregate between classes and after school. Annual events are often held in this area, including Senior Soccer Night and the annual JCS Arts and Crafts Festival.
The school is undergoing renovation, tentatively scheduled to start in 2009, to upgrade the elementary buildings, the high school, library, and athletic facilities. The school is holding a fund-raising drive titled "Legacy for His Kingdom" to provide the monies needed for these renovations.
Student body.
The school's student body and faculty represent various Christian denominations, though the vast majority are Protestant. As a private school, JCS draws students from a wide geographic area, though most teachers and students reside in the Greater Johnstown area.
Johnstown Christian School accommodates about 300 students. The school is subdivided into three schools: elementary school (kindergarten through fifth grade), middle school (sixth through eighth grade), and high school (ninth through twelfth grade). The ratio of students to faculty at the school is about 6:1.
Administration.
At the head of Johnstown Christian School administration is the Johnstown Christian School Board of Directors, a nine-member board chosen to oversee the daily operations of the school system.
Academics.
A Christian world view is integrated into all areas of the curriculum. Bible class and weekly chapel attendance are required for all students. Instruction is held in all academic areas and is college preparatory in focus. The school year for students extends from the first week of September to the first week of June, for a total of 180 school or education days.
High school is structured into eight periods of 42-minute classes, with a 25-minute lunch period. Physical education is a required course for all students (with classes being combined with girls and boys) for half a year and sex ed for the other half of the year. Advanced Placement level courses are offered formally in five subjects.
Curriculum choices are guided by Pennsylvania State Standards for high school graduation.
At JCS, over 95% of all graduates obtain higher education within the first three years after graduation.
Discovery Center.
The Discovery Center helps students overcome academic difficulties which may be due to learning differences, with the ultimate goal being to help them reach their highest potential and be more fully prepared to realize God’s purposes for them. Johnstown Christian School believes that each child has a unique role in God's plan, and is a special individual created and loved by God. “The Lord will fulfill His purpose for me: your love, O Lord, endures forever—do not abandon the work of your hands.” Psalm 138:8
Extracurricular activities.
Johnstown Christian School provides extracurricular activities to develop individual student interest and abilities. Students can participate in one or more of the following:
Association of Christian Schools International.
JCS is also a standing member of the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). This allows students the opportunities to participate in numerous academic activities including:
Drama.
Although JCS does not have a drama class, school thespians and musicians work on plays and musicals performed at the end of each year. Musicals and plays alternate, with musicals one year and plays the next.
The JCS drama team has been performing for more than 10 years. Past performances have included the following:
Arts and Crafts festival.
Every May the Arts and Crafts Festival is conducted by students from all class levels. The festival serves as a fund-raising opportunity for each class. Included at this event are food, craft, and art booths; a silent auction; and the annual 5k run. This event is a major fund raising event for both individual classes as well as the school as a whole. It is also an opportunity for the people of the community to see a glimpse of the school, the students, and faculty.
Intramural banquets.
Each year two banquets are held for high school students: the annual Christmas Banquet and the Junior-Senior banquet, which replaces the traditional prom held in most high schools.
Missions trip.
Each year, students in their local youth groups participate in a summer missions trip to evangelize the un-reached people of those areas.
Spiritual retreat.
Every year, the high school invites Christian speakers and missionaries from around the country for a half-week visit at the Ligonier Camp and Conference Center. During the retreat students participate in a variety of activities including worship sessions, games, and social interaction.
Athletics.
Johnstown Christian School offers two main sports. Men have the option of basketball and soccer on the junior high, junior varsity, and varsity levels. Women have the option of basketball and soccer on the same levels, and softball. Varsity Cross Country and Track have been made available for interested students in 2009 as well. 
JCS was a long-time member of the Allegheny Christian Athletic Association (ACAA), taking home men's and women's titles for both soccer and basketball. 
Since 2005, JCS has been a member of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA), and schedules most competitions against local public schools. JCS is now eligible to participate in district, regional, and state level competitions. 
JCS still holds the tradition of attending the annual Erie Christian School Invitational in Erie, Pennsylvania.

"Morgan's Run" is a historical novel by Colleen McCullough published in 2000 about the life of an English prisoner driven to the first penal colonies in Australia in the 18th century. Much of the novel is set in the penal colony on Norfolk Island. It starts off with the prisoners life in Bristol England and describes in detail of his survival of the transportation on a prison ship to Norfolk Island and how he dared to hope in the hard life of a convict on Norfolk Island.
The musical.
The book has been adapted into a musical by Colleen McCullough and composer Gavin Lockley The musical's debut was over 8 shows in the Springwood Civic Centre by the Blue Mountains Musical Society with a cast of 32, a small classical orchestra, a harpsichord, and a rock drum kit. These performances were organised in support of the Royal Flying Doctor Service and attended by the Governor of New South Wales, Her Excellency, Professor Marie Bashir AC, CVO.
Gavin Lockley worked closely with Colleen McCullough and spent most of 2010 on Norfolk Island, the penal colony to which the musical's main character Richard Morgan was sent. Lockley's previous works including The Symphony of Australia and Ballads of the Bush have sought to express the history and essence of the nation and create a distinctive national musical heritage. Whilst Ballads of the Bush sets popular Australian verse to music, and the Symphony of Australia celebrates a nation, Morgan's Run is a narrative about the founding of a nation and its character.

Insurgentes (album)

Insurgentes is the title of the first full-length solo album released by British musician and record producer Steven Wilson, known for being the founder and frontman of psychedelic/progressive rock band Porcupine Tree. The album was recorded all over the world in studios from Mexico City to Japan and Israel, between January and August 2008, and released in November 2008 as a special deluxe multi disc mail order version, with retail release to follow in February 2009. According to Wilson himself, the album contained "the most experimental song-based music had made."
The album is named after the Avenida de los Insurgentes, the longest avenue in Mexico City near which part of it was recorded. 
History.
On 16 July 2008, a photograph showing Steven Wilson in the central sculpture of the Espacio Escultórico (Spanish for "Sculptural Space") of UNAM's Ciudad Universitaria —located nearby the Avenida de los Insurgentes—, with a cloudy sky background and the phrase «STEVEN WILSON - INSURGENTES ...COMING SOON...» appeared in the main page at Steven Wilson's official site.
On 6 August, a trailer video was posted to Steven Wilson and Lasse Hoile's respective MySpace pages, and to Lasse Hoile's YouTube page; since 8 August, also in Wilson's webpage. The song featured in the trailer is the first song of the album, "Harmony Korine". Lasse Hoile has been collaborating as a visual and video director for Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, Opeth, Dream Theater and more recently The Pineapple Thief. The trailer belongs to a documentary of the same name he directed that accompanies the album.
On 25 August, an "Insurgentes" microsite was set up (now at http://www.insurgentesfilm.com/), and is the official website for the album, from which people were able to pre-order the album as of 6 October. The special edition quickly sold out.
On 28 September, a second trailer was released featuring a 3 and a half minute edit of a song called "Get All You Deserve" (the song is 6:17 in length on the album). Since 22 October, "Get All You Deserve" can be found in an album containing sampler tracks from side projects by all Porcupine Tree members, titled "Porcupine Tree - Solo Sampler 2008".
The woman appearing in the trailer is Susana Moyaho, who along with Lasse Hoile and Carl Glover captured the photographs for the booklet of the album. She also provided spoken words to the tracks "Only Child" and "Port Rubicon".
The songs "Harmony Korine", "Salvaging" and "Get All You Deserve" can be heard in their entirety through Wilson's MySpace page as well as film music for the "Insurgentes" documentary movie.
The track "Veneno Para Las Hadas" was named after a 1984 Mexican horror film of the same name directed by Carlos Enrique Taboada.
Influences.
Steven Wilson mentions post-punk and shoegaze music as a major influence for the album, citing bands like Joy Division, Killing Joke, The Flaming Lips, My Bloody Valentine, and The Cure. He says the album is also very noise and drone-oriented.
Versions.
Limited deluxe edition.
The special deluxe edition was limited to 3000 copies as a double CD plus a DVD-A, and another 1000 copies in vinyl (100 grams), both with a 120 page-hardback book, sold only via Headphone Dust mail order from a microsite in October 2008. All sold out within two weeks. Though this edition was released in 2008, the album is considered a 2009 release.
The CD/DVD-A edition includes the album itself, with a second CD consisting of songs recorded during the same sessions but excluded from the final tracklist. The DVD-A contains a 5.1 Surround Sound mix of the album, 24-bit stereo resolution, a trailer for the album that had been posted online, and an 18-minute clip from the Lasse Hoile film "Insurgentes". The vinyl edition contains all songs from the CD/DVD-A version.
Wilson briefly considered re-pressing the special edition due to the high demand and ultimately decided not to, but later released all the extra tracks of the Special Edition bonus disc through his SoundCloud.com account as full-resolution WAVs.
Retail edition.
The album has been available as a digital download since 16 February 2009. Those purchasers ordering the album from the Burning Shed online store received a link within a confirmation email to download the entire album in 256 kbit/s MP3 format to listen while waiting for the physical copy to arrive.
The Kscope retail edition of the album was physically released on 24 February 2009 in the US, 7 March in Australia and 9 March in the UK. It contains the original CD and DVD-A packaged in a hardback book. They also released an edition in a Super Jewel Box instead of digipak. In the US, a shortly-lived version with an autographed booklet was distributed by Newbury Comics starting from 24 February. This offer was packaged in jewelcase instead of the hardback digipak, and the DVD only had the 5.1 album mix with neither the trailers nor the 18-minute film excerpt.
Japanese edition.
The album saw a Japanese release on 4 February 2009, containing both CDs from the special edition and a 40-page booklet in a hard cardboard case, with no DVD.
Limited vinyl edition.
Kscope issued a double LP vinyl edition, shipped on 30 March 2009, which contains the regular album plus all bonus tracks of the deluxe edition on Side D, with the exception of "The 78". It was limited to 2000 copies and only available from the Burning Shed online store.
Singles.
A single for the song "Harmony Korine" was released on 23 February, in a choice of black, white, or blood red coloured 7-inch vinyl, each limited to 1000 copies. The A-Side is a remixed edit of album track "Harmony Korine", and the B-side is a track called "The 78", only available previously as an untitled hidden track on the bonus disc of the deluxe edition. A promotional video of the single was uploaded to the mini-site and by Lasse Hoile to his YouTube channel. Shortly after the clip appeared in the website of "Blender" magazine.
The song was NPR's "Song of the day" on 4 March 2009.
Remix competition and "NSRGNTS RMXS".
From 31 January 2009, a renewed "Insurgentes" microsite created by Kscope replaced the old one, thought to offer information about the retail edition of the album, featuring more digital and interactive content than the previous site, including a competition to remix the track "Abandoner". Two remixes appeared as examples in the site, one by British dream pop band Engineers and other by King Crimson drummer Pat Mastelotto. Initially, the deadline for the competition was Friday 27 February, but by demand of those involved ones, it was extended one month until 27 March. 
As of 15 May 2009, an EP titled "NSRGNTS RMXS" was available to order worldwide in both CD and Vinyl formats, the last one limited to 1000 copies. It comprises songs from the album mixed by David A. Sitek of New York indie rock band TV on the Radio, Pat Mastelotto, Engineers, Hip Hop duo Dälek, and ambient artist Fear Falls Burning. The tracklist vary between both release formats. 
Wilson chose eight of all the resulting mixes of "Abandoner", then people could vote through the "Insurgentes" website among those versions, and the resulting winner track was included in the digital download and CD versions of the EP. The voting ended on 29 May.
Track listing.
Bonus disc.
The limited deluxe edition and the Japanese edition of the album include a bonus disc. All tracks, except the hidden "The 78", are also included on Side D of the Kscope limited vinyl edition. All of these tracks are available through SW's SoundCloud.com account as full resolution WAVs.
Vinyl edition.
The Kscope vinyl edition of 2000 copies has the same track listing as the regular album (tracks 1-3 on Side A, 4-6 on Side B and 7-10 on Side C), plus all songs of the limited deluxe edition bonus disc on Side D, with the exception of "The 78".
"Insurgentes" road movie.
"Insurgentes" is a documentary, filmed and directed by Lasse Hoile, based on the curiosity of an artist to travel around the world and find inspiration to create music.
An 18-minute extract from the film is included on the DVD packaged with the deluxe edition of the album "Insurgentes." The locations for the film include the Mexican Xochimilco canals and ex-Templo de Santa Teresa La Antigua (a church where piano and voices for the song "Insurgentes" were recorded). Other places where the filming took place were Sweden, England, Finland, Holland, USA and Denmark.
The film is now being screened all over the world through many independent film festivals, with a world premiere in the Danish International Film Festival. Other screenings include Swedish "Sensurround Music Film Festival", the "Unerhoert Music Film Festival" in Hamburg, Germany, Mexican "Ambulante" and Argentine "Cinema At The Museum", of Mendoza.
The DVD was released on 27 September 2010. The first pre-orders will receive an additional bonus CD containing a 9 minutes song titled "Vapour Trail Lullaby" which was demoed during the "In Absentia" era and at the time only released in a very modified version as simply "Lullaby" in the Blackfield debut album. The DVD film contains a 31 minute film of Bass Communion and Pig live in Mexico City, the "Harmony Korine" video, trailers, an alternate ending, footage of a Q+A session with Steven Wilson and Lasse Hoile from the international premiere at the Copenhagen film festival, 6 audio out-takes from the album recording sessions, and is mixed in stereo and 5.1 surround sound with Spanish, French, German, and English subtitles.
iPod destruction.
For the "Insurgentes" film, Wilson tested various ways to destroy iPods, as a protest against how the MP3 format reduces the experience of the listener. "I really wonder if people realise what shit they are listening to when they listen to an MP3", worries Steven Wilson, who compares the final result of such audio compression with someone who is staring at a photocopy of a painting in an Art Gallery. The methods of destruction move within a range of at least 10 different elements, including a sledgehammer, a blowtorch, a shotgun and a wood chipper among others.

Bad Blood (2003)

Bad Blood (2003) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by Maxim Hair Color, which took place on June 15, 2003 at the Compaq Center in Houston, Texas. It was the second event produced under the Bad Blood name and starred wrestlers from the Raw brand. This event marked the beginning of pay-per-views (with the exception of the older and more significant Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series pay-per-views) being brand exclusive.
The main event was a Hell in a Cell match, featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure. In this match, World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeated Kevin Nash to retain his title. Two predominant bouts were featured on the undercard; in respective singles matches, Ric Flair defeated Shawn Michaels and Goldberg defeated Chris Jericho.
The event marked the second time the Hell in a Cell format was used by WWE in a Bad Blood event; the first was at In Your House: Badd Blood in 1997. The 2003 Bad Blood event grossed over $500,000 ticket sales from an attendance of 10,000 and received about 285,000 pay-per-view buys, which was more than the following year's event. This event helped WWE increase its yearly pay-per-view revenue by $6.2 million from the previous year. When the event was released on DVD, it reached a peak position of second on "Billboard"'s DVD Sales Chart.
Background.
The event featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of events which built tension, leading to a wrestling match. All wrestlers were from the Raw brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other being SmackDown!.
The main event at Bad Blood featured World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defending the title against Kevin Nash in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of metal dubbed as the Hell in a Cell match. The buildup to the match began two months prior at Backlash, where Triple H nailed Kevin Nash with the sledgehammer during the Six man Tag team match, enabling Triple H to Pin Nash for the victory. The following month at Judgment Day, Nash defeated Triple H in a standard wrestling match, also called a singles match, via disqualification but didn't win the championship. The following night on an episode of "Raw", one of WWE's primary television programs, after Triple H successfully defended the World title against Ric Flair, General Manager Steve Austin, a fictitious match maker and rules enforcer, announced that due to Kevin Nash winning the match at Judgment Day by disqualification, Nash would face Triple H again at Bad Blood for the World Heavyweight title in a Hell in a Cell match to avoid disqualifications. On the May 26, 2003 episode of "Raw", the staged rivalry between the two wrestlers intensified when Randy Orton and Triple H, both of whom were members of Evolution, an alliance of wrestlers that also consisted of Ric Flair, attacked Nash. The following week during an episode of "Raw", Nash gained redemption over the previous week's attack when he alongside Shawn Michaels and The Hurricane defeated Evolution in a tag team match. After the match, Nash lifted and sat Triple H on his shoulders and then slammed him back-first down to the mat, a maneuver Nash calls the Jacknife powerbomb. On June 9, 2003 during an episode of "Raw", Austin announced that Mick Foley, a professional wrestler who had retired three years prior at No Way Out 2000, would officiate the Hell in a Cell match as the guest referee.
One of the featured preliminary matches was Shawn Michaels versus Ric Flair in a singles match. The hype to this match began on May 26, 2003 during an episode of "Raw", where Michaels challenged Flair to a singles match for later during the show, which Flair accepted. As the match was about to take place, the other General Manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the Flair versus Michaels match was to take place at Bad Blood instead of on the broadcast of "Raw". Later on that episode, Flair and Michaels lost to World Champion Triple H in a Handicap match after Flair cheap shoted Michaels, enabling Triple H to finish him off with the Pedigree. The following Monday on "Raw", it was determined that Lance Storm was the "mystery assailant". He, however, told Austin that he was only hired to run Goldberg over and that Jericho conspired the attack.
Preliminary matches.
After "Sunday Night Heat", the pay-per-view began with a tag team match where the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) faced Rodney Mack and Christopher Nowinski in a tag team match. The match was initially dominated by the Dudley Boyz and they even caused serious damage when they hit the Wassup? on Nowinski. During the match, Theodore Long, Mack and Nowinski's manager, verbally distracted D-Von, which was scripted to result in D-Von punching Long and distracting the referee. During this time, Nowinski hit Bubba in the face with a face mask that he was wearing. After the referee placed his attention to the match, Nowiniski covered Bubba for the pinfall. Following the tag team match, the first contest in the "Redneck Triathlon" was held, in which Steve Austin defeated Eric Bischoff in a belching contest using pre-recorded belches.
The second wrestling match on the pay-per-view was Scott Steiner versus Test in a singles match in which the winner would earn the managing services of Stacy Keibler. In the early stages both competitors wrestled inconclusively, before Steiner used a Belly to belly suplex on Test. Afterward, Test rolled out of the ring and grabbed a steel chair. As he was about to hit Steiner with it, however, it bounced off the top rope and hit Test in his face. Steiner followed up on the situation by using the Steiner Flatliner and covered Test for the pinfall and thus winning Keibler's managing services.
The next match was a singles match, in which WWE Intercontinental Champion Christian defended the title against Booker T. The match began with Booker T hitting Christian with a spinebuster. Towards the end of the match, Booker T performed a spinarooni. As a result, Christian was scripted to appear frustrated, grab the Intercontinental title belt and hit Booker T in the head with it. Therefore, Booker T won the match by disqualification. In WWE, a championship cannot change hands when a match results in a disqualification or countout, thus Christian retained the title. Following the match, the second contest in the "Redneck Triathlon" was held; Austin and Bischoff had to place their face on the crotch of Mae Young, which Bischoff won after Austin forfeited.
Another match on the undercard was a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship. This was the final pay-per-view that featured a masked Kane. Kane and Rob Van Dam defended the titles against La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvan Grenier). La Résistance gained the early advantage when Grenier DDTed RVD. Kane and Van Dam, however, regained control of the match when Kane chokeslammed Duprée. Towards the end of the match, Kane brawled with Grenier and Duprée at ringside, which prompted Van Dam to perform an aerial technique onto ringside. La Résistance, however, avoided the attack resulting in Van Dam landing on Kane. In the ring, while Kane was still at ringside, La Resistance performed a double spinebuster on Van Dam, proceeding into a pinfall to win the World Tag Team Championship.
Main event matches.
The first main match was Goldberg versus Chris Jericho in a singles match. In the early stages of the match, Jericho and Goldberg fought at ringside. During this tussle, Goldberg attempted to execute a spear on Jericho, who was positioned on the security barricade; Jericho, however, was scripted to avoid the attack as Goldberg performed the spear and broke through the security barricade. Goldberg was billed as being injured, prompting Jericho to apply several submission holds on Goldberg's injured shoulder. After remaining in control for the duration of the match, Goldberg was able to counter Jericho's Wall's of Jericho and hit the Jackhammer on him. Goldberg then covered Jericho for the pinfall.
The other predominant match was Ric Flair versus Shawn Michaels in a singles match. During the match, Michaels set up a table at ringside and positioned Flair on it. Randy Orton was then scripted to come through the audience and interfere in the match, though, Michaels performed a superkick on him. This followed with Michaels performing a Splash on Flair, in the process breaking the table, which resulted in the enhancement of the body splash. Towards the end of the match, Michaels was scripted to knock the referee down and as he was about to perform a Sweet Chin Music on Flair, Orton came into the ring and hit Michaels' head with a folding chair. Because the referee was incapacitated, Flair could not be disqualified for the interference. Orton then placed Flair on top of Michaels and ran out of the ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by Flair. After the match, the final contest in the "Redneck Triathlon" was held. Originally the contest was supposed to be a singing contest, though both men agreed to change it into a pigpen contest, where the objective was to throw your opponent into a pigpen. Austin threw Bischoff into a pigpen set up near the Bad Blood entrance stage, thus Austin won the triathlon 2–1.
The main event was the Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Kevin Nash with Mick Foley as the guest referee. During the beginning of the match, both wrestlers used a steel chair, a hammer, and the steel cage to their advantage. Eventually, Nash hit Triple H with a barbed wire bat several times before Triple H was able to hit him with the steel ring stairs. As Triple H brought a sledgehammer into the ring, Foley attempted to take the object away from him, resulting in Triple H hitting Foley and then Nash in the head with a steel chair. Triple H followed up by Pedigree on Nash. During this time, Foley had recuperated and was able to officiate the pinfall made by Triple H on Nash, thus Triple H retained the World Heavyweight Championship.
Aftermath.
After Bad Blood, Steve Austin announced an Elimination Chamber match to take place at SummerSlam for the World Heavyweight Championship, a match contested in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. The match featured, Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels; at SummerSlam, Triple H won the match to retain the World Heavyweight title. The storyline between Flair and Michaels ended when Michaels was announced as a participant in the Elimination Chamber match, in which Flair would not participate. Although their feud ended, the feud reengaged five years later in 2008. At WrestleMania XXIV, Michaels defeated Flair in a retirement match, a stipulation that only applied to Flair. As a result, Flair retired from professional wrestling.
Jericho and Goldberg continued to feud over several weeks before being announced as participants in the Elimination Chamber match, in which Goldberg eliminated Jericho. During the weeks leading up to SummerSlam, Kane would turn on Rob Van Dam after the loss of their tag titles, and his unmasking which occurred eight days after this event along with his heel transformation, would lead to the promotion of a no disqualification singles match between the two at SummerSlam in which Kane won, ending their team. La Résistance would engage in a feud with the Dudley Boyz, eventually a match was scheduled for SummerSlam between the two teams over the World Tag Team titles. La Résistance was able to win the match and retain the titles.
Reception.
The Compaq Center had a maximum capacity of 16,285, which was reduced for Bad Blood. The event grossed $500,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 10,000—the maximum allowed. The event retailed as $34.95, but was offered free of charge to members of the United States armed forces who were returning from the Iraq War. Not counting the buys from military personnel, the event received 285,000 pay-per-view buys. The promotion's pay-per-view revenue was $24.7 million, which was greater than the following year's revenue of $18.5 million. "Canadian Online Explorer"'s professional wrestling section rated the event a four out of ten possible points. The main event was rated a five out of ten possible points, while the standard match between Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels rated a seven and a half out of ten possible points. "Pro Wrestling Torch", a newsletter and wrestling website in operation since 1987, rated the event a three and a half out of ten possible points. Both websites criticized the fact that the pay-per-view ended twenty-five minutes before the original scheduled runtime.
The event was released on DVD on August 18, 2003. The DVD was distributed by Sony Music Entertainment. The DVD debuted on "Billboard"'s Top Weekly DVD sales chart on September 6, 2003, reaching a peak position of second. The DVD remained on the chart for eight more weeks, ranking lower every week. The DVD finally ranked on October 25, 2003 reaching a final position of 19th. The DVD also received reviews from customers; the average customer rating from Amazon.com was a three out of five possible stars.

General chemistry

General chemistry (sometimes called "gen chem" for short) is a course often taught at the high school and introductory university level. It is intended to serve as a broad introduction to a variety of concepts in chemistry and is widely taught. At the university level, it is also sometimes used as a "weed out" course for disciplines (sometimes related, sometimes not) which are perceived to require a high level of intellectual rigor or large course loads. It is also one of the few chemistry courses in most universities that does not explicitly explore a particular discipline such as organic chemistry or analytical chemistry.
General chemistry courses typically introduce concepts such as stoichiometry, prediction of reaction products, thermodynamics, nuclear chemistry, electrochemistry, chemical kinetics, and many of the rudiments of physical chemistry. Though the list of subjects covered is typically broad, leading some to criticize both the class and the discipline as encouraging memorization, most general chemistry courses are firmly grounded in several fundamental physical rules for which the primary challenge is understanding when the rules are applicable.

Rúgbrauð

Rúgbrauð () is an Icelandic straight rye bread, dark and dense, usually rather sweet, traditionally baked in a pot or steamed in special wooden casks by burying it in the ground near a hot spring. Modern "rúgbrauð" is usually made in a square baking pan. The bread is crustless, dark and very dense and keeps for a long time. It is often served with butter, mutton pâté, hangikjöt (smoked lamb), or with pickled herring. Dry "rúgbrauð" would be ground and mixed with buttermilk to form a kind of porridge. Stale "rúgbrauð" is often soaked, then made into "brauðsúpa" (bread soup) - that is, simmered with raisins and flavorings (usually lemon) and served hot with whipped cream as a dessert.
Excessive consumption of this bread is said to cause flatulence, earning it its nickname "þrumari" which roughly translates as "thunderbread".
There are, however, varieties of the traditional rye bread with wheat and whole grain added to make it less dense, but also called "rúgbrauð". These varieties tend to be less heavy than the traditional straight rye variety and more similar to the modern Danish rugbrød or German pumpernickel.
Rye, produced in Denmark and exported to Iceland, became the predominant cereal in Icelandic cuisine in the early modern period after a trade monopoly was instituted by the king of Denmark in 1602, remaining in vigor until 1786.

Monument to Balzac

Monument to Balzac is a sculpture by Auguste Rodin in memory of the French novelist Balzac. According to Rodin, the sculpture aims to portray the writer’s persona rather than a physical likeness. The work was commissioned in 1891 by the Société des Gens de Lettres, a full size plaster model was displayed in 1898 at a Salon in Champ de Mars. After coming under criticism the model was rejected by the société and Rodin moved it to his home in Meudon. On July 2, 1939 (22 years after the sculptor's death) the model was cast in bronze for the first time and placed on the Boulevard du Montparnasse.
Casts and various studies of the sculpture are today in many different locations including Middelheim in Antwerp, The Norton Simon Museum of Art, the Musée Rodin in Meudon, the Hirshhorn Museum, the Hirschhorn Sculpture Garden (Smithsonian) in Washington D.C, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Gallery of Victoria , the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, in front of the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands and in Caracas, Venezuela in the open spaces around the former Ateneo de Caracas, now UNEARTES . Today the artwork is sometimes considered the first truly modern sculpture.
Commission.
The Société des Gens de Lettres (Paris, France) considered four different artists for the sculptural work before it was given to Rodin. The first was French neoclassical artist Henri Chapu, however, Chapu died in 1891 before the work could be finalized. Marquet de Vasselot was the next artist considered for the sculpture and provided a bust of the writer for the Societé. At the same time artists Millet and Coutan also applied for the commission.
Rodin was not initially considered for the work because at that point in time, around 1885, his career had not become as prominent. After the death of Chapu, the recently elected president of the Societé, Émile Zola strongly supported Rodin for the job and, so, the artist submitted a proposal to have a completed three-meter statue of the French novelist within an eighteen-month period which was approved.
The commission was in response to the elevated importance of Honoré de Balzac after his death. Balzac was one of the founders of the Societé as well as the second president of the organization. Upon his death in 1850 interest in creating a statue to commemorate the writer quickly developed under the leadership of Alexandre Dumas, père.
Preparation.
Instead of the designated eighteen-month period of time, Rodin employed a lengthy seven years to finish the work. Rodin became infatuated with the literature of his subject as well as researched the character and personality of Balzac, similar to the writer’s own approach to character development. In preparation for the sculpture, Rodin read the author’s works as well as traveled numerous times to the author’s hometown of Touraine France in order to sketch and model clay portrait studies from individuals with similar likeness to the novelist although Rodin never saw him in person. Rodin had clothes resembling those of the Balzac’s made by the writer’s former tailor, using a cloak similar to Balzac’s writing cloak for his final statue. The studies ranged from portrait to muscular and elderly nude figures along with humorous and distorted representations with sexual emphasis. Rodin repeatedly studied the cloak as well as different facial features that he derived from his observational studies and limited references including a daguerreotype of Balzac. Each sketch evolved and transformed into a different representation of the novelist varying from phallic nudes to heavily clothed and hidden figures.
In 1894, the Societé threatened to step in legally with the commission, turn the job over to artist Alexandre Falguière and take away Rodin’s payment. Yet Rodin continued to ask for extensions on time making over fifty studies and continuously distanced himself from a true physical portrayal, tending towards a more psychological representation. The artist became infatuated with capturing the essence of the author’s strength. In a message to writer Charles Chincholle in May, 1898, Rodin explained his artistic pursuit:
"The only thing I realize today is that the neck is too strong. I thought I had to enlarge it because according to me, modern sculpture must exaggerate the forms form the moral point of view. Through the exaggerated neck I wanted to represent strength I realize that the execution exceeded the idea.”
Final study.
The "Final Study for the Monument to Balzac" is a smaller version study for the final statue.
Rejection.
Finally in 1898, Rodin presented a plaster study of the Balzac statue in the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. The sculpture was not received well by the critics; Rodin took the negativity as a personal attack. Many disliked the grotesque stature of the figure while others criticized the work to be very similar to that of the Italian impressionist Medardo Rosso. As well, reports surfaced before the unveiling of the sculpture regarding anticipated dismay over the final outcome of the artwork. The Société des Gens de Lettres decided to disregard the commission to Rodin and not accept the sculpture.
Regardless of rejection from his commissionaires, contemporaries such as Paul Cézanne, Toulouse-Lautrec and Claude Monet supported Rodin in his point of view. A backlash against the rejection along with a petition signed by supporters in the artistic community proceeded, yet in the end, Rodin decidedly declined any bids for the work and placed the plaster artwork in his home at Meudon.

A Summary View of the Rights of British America

A Summary View of the Rights of British America was a tract written by Thomas Jefferson in 1774, before the U.S. Declaration of Independence, in which he laid out for delegates to the First Continental Congress, a set of grievances against the King, especially against his (and Parliament's) response to the Boston Tea Party. Jefferson declares that the British Parliament did not have the right to govern the Thirteen Colonies. He argues that since all of the colonies were founded they were independent of British rule. Jefferson, in this work, held that allodial title, not feudal title, was held to American lands; thus the people did not owe fees and rents for that land to the British crown. 
The work was presented to and debated by the First Continental Congress. When this took place, Jefferson did not attend. Despite his attempts, the members of the house agreed to a more moderate decision than Jefferson's proposed concept. Despite not being able to completely convince Congress, friends of Jefferson printed the "Summary" in a pamphlet form. It was distributed throughout London, New York and Philadelphia. Research states that the document "helped establish Jefferson's reputation as a skillful, if radical, political writer."

Now Take My Wife

Now Take My Wife was a BBC situation comedy which ran for only one series of 14 episodes in 1971.
It starred Sheila Hancock and Donald Houston as a suburban middle-class couple, Claire and Harry Love. He would start each episode by turning to the camera and saying "Now ... take my wife" (except for one episode where they were supposed to be very drunk when he said "Now wake my tife").
They had a teenage daughter, played by Liz Edmiston (in real life in her mid-20s). Their next-door neighbour was an eccentric German woman, who also had a daughter.
Of the 14 episodes, two are currently missing from the BBC archives; they were either wiped to reuse the tapes or possibly lost at one stage after their first broadcast.
Several years later, in a "Guardian" interview, Hancock indicated that she was not very happy with the programme, seeing it as an example of the sort of stereotyped role for women actors she landed. However, her character often got the better of her husband during each episode.

<doc id="18761261" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18761261" title="Fa'amatai">
Fa'amatai

"Fa'amatai" is the chiefly system of Samoa, central to the organization of Samoan society.
It is the traditional indigenous form of governance in the Samoa Islands, comprising American Samoa and the Independent State of Samoa. The term comprises the prefix "fa'a" (Samoan for "in the way of") and the word "matai" (family name or title).
Of central importance in the system are the "matai", the holders of family chief titles, and their role in looking after their family. "Fa'amatai" is the key socio-political system of governance and way of life ("fa'a Samoa") in Samoan culture. Inherent in the "fa'amatai" system is the welfare and well-being of the extended family ("'aiga") and the protection of family property, consisting most importantly of customary land.
In the 49-seat parliament of independent Samoa, all 47 "Samoan" Members of Parliament are also "matai", performing dual roles as chiefs and modern politicians, with the exception of the two seats reserved for non-Samoans.
The "fa'amatai" system is significant in modern Samoa where most of the land, about 81% (567,000 acres), is under customary ownership with the rest under the national government ("malo") as public lands with another 4% freehold.
The 2011 official census of independent Samoa identified a total of 16,787 "matai" (8.9%) living in the country from a total population of 187,820. Of the total number of "matai", 15,021 (89.5%) were male and 1,766 (10.5%) were female.
The "Fa'amatai" system has been greatly impacted upon by colonialism as well as Samoa's modern politics which came into effect when the country gained independence in 1962.
Former system of government.
"The Cyclopedia of Samoa" (published 1907) states: 
"The old form of government in Samoa seems to have approached closely to the monarchical government obtaining in Tahiti and the Sandwich Islands. It was something of a combination of the monarchical and patriarchal forms. While the whole group was nominally governed by one head, or king the various districts had their own separate governments under their chiefs and local authorities, all for the most part independent of each other. The power of a high chief in whom the five distinct titles of the "O le Tupu" were centred was very great, and extended over the whole group of islands. 
Three great families comprise what may be termed the aristocracy of Samoa - "Sa Mataafa", "Sa Malietoa", and "Sa Muagututi'a"- and for a great length of time the title of "O le Tupu" was confined to members of the last-named family. 
The ramifications of these three families spread throughout the entire group. On the death of the Safe-o-fafine, the last king in the Muagututi'a line, the title remained in abeyance for a long time, and was eventually usurped by a war priest of Manono. O le Tamafaiga, who assumed the attributes of a god as well as those of a king. He was actually worshipped as a god and developed into a tyrant. In the hope of escaping from his tyranny, the people of A'ana conferred their title of "Tui A'ana" upon him, but only to further smart under his oppressive rule. Soon he obtained the remaining titles, and was proclaimed "O le Tupu-o-Samoa". And so for the first time for many generations the dignity passed from the family of Muagututi'a. A'ana not only lost the prestige it had so long held in this connection but the royal residence no longer was situated in the province, the new king continuing to reside on Manono. As his tyranny increased, in like proportion increased the hatred of the people of A'ana, and at length they rose against him and he was killed in 1829. This was just before John Williams, whose name is a shining light in the annals of missionary enterprise, visited Samoa for the first time. A bloody war ensued and A'ana's power was broken and the district laid waste."
Governance.
Samoa's chiefly system revolves around family (aiga") kinship, based on the culture's communal and extended family relationships. The term aiga" includes not only the immediate family (father, mother and children), but also the whole union of families of a clan and even those who although not related are subject to the family control.
At the local level, much of the country's civil and criminal matters are dealt with by some 360 village chief councils, "Fono o Matai", according to traditional law, a practice further strengthened by the 1990 Village Fono Law. 
Most Samoans live in villages consisting of groups of families with close ties and history. The influence of the "matai" is felt not only in the village but also in the district and even beyond. The active factor in the life of the village is the village council or "fono o matai" and its members are the "matai". The "fono of matai" is the executive and judicial authority of every village in Samoa. If a matter is of importance the assembly is held on the "malae", the open space in front of the village. 
The speakers address the assembly and stand to do so. The listeners are comfortably seated on mats. Those not taking part in these assemblies are described as "tagatanu'u" (people of the village) and include untitled men, women and children. Democratic ideas do not prevail at these "fono"s and decisions are independent of majority or minority rule. The decision of one or more "matai sili" (senior "matai") is decisive. The remainder who are merely at the "fono" to listen, agree with the decisions given. It is permissible for the minor "matai" to discuss the matter with and endeavour to try to influence the "matai sili" before the "fono" commences. 
Before the "fono" commences preliminary councils are held ("taupulega") by the different groups and at these councils the single family heads exchange opinions and endeavour to convince each other and to create harmony in order that when the actual "fono" eventuates everything will move smoothly. Some "matai" are permitted to speak at these "fono" without having any right to make a decision.
The 2006 census of Samoa also revealed that 96% of the country's "matai" were actively involved in village activities as part of their "matai" responsibilities. The 4% 'not active' was explained as possibly due to the "matai" holding more than one title or living away from the village where their title belonged.
Authority.
The authority of the "matai" has some limits. They are called upon to discuss all important matters with everyone of significance belonging to the family union. If the matter is of minor importance and only of interest to the immediate village family, more distant relations may be omitted from discussion. "Matai" subject to a senior "matai" ("matai sili") are independent in family matters concerning their own single family unless they have a "tuaigoa" shared title name only, in which case they are not referred to at all in family matters and may be deprived of their names at the will of their superior at any time.
Modern politics.
The "fa'amatai" system is entrenched in Samoan politics. From the country's independence in 1962, only "matai" could vote and stand as candidates in elections to parliament. In 1990, the voting system was changed by the Electoral Amendment Act which introduced universal suffrage and the right to vote for adults aged 21-years and over. However, the right to stand for elections remains with "matai", who are themselves selected by consensus of their families, including non-matai family members. Therefore, every Samoan Member of Parliament is also a "matai", performing dual roles as a 'chief' as well as duties in the Samoan parliament. This applies to most Samoans in positions of public responsibility from the Prime Minister of Samoa to the country's Head of State, who is referred to as "O le Ao o le Malo" (the chieftain of the government).
Colonial influences.
As "matai" head their families and represent their villages, communities and districts, important high-ranking title-holders came to play significant roles in colonial politics with the advent of western powers and rivalry in the 19th century.
The colonial era saw Britain, Germany and the United States supporting different "matai" (such as Mata'afa Iosefo and the youthful Malietoa Tanumafili I) in order to gain political influence in Samoa. This led to the colonial powers bestowing the European title of king upon their own candidate during the tumultous years of the late 19th century, leading to warring among competing high-ranking "matai" in different districts.
The Samoan term "tupu", referring to paramount status over a particular region or the entire island group, has sometimes been translated incorrectly to the English language as "king" in the European sense. The relatively brief usage of the term "king" died out with the end of colonialism. 
In the early 20th century, "matai" leadership played a pivotal role in the pro-independence Mau movement which eventually led to Western Samoa's independence in 1962.
"Matai" title.
Each "matai" has a name ("suafa") by and through which they exercise their rights in the family over which they preside. "Matai" names are for the most part very old ones and are handed down from generation to generation. "Matai" titles can be bestowed on one person or numerous family members who are distinguished from each other by their Christian name.
It is common for each '"aiga" to have a number of "matai" titles, however, one particular title will be the most important and serve as the main "matai" title. The title of a family "matai" which is peculiar and particular to that family is the subject of tradition and is faithfully recorded by the family and passed on from generation to generation.
It sometimes happens that new names are for some reason taken and the old ones discarded or passed on to lesser or junior chiefs. 
In Samoan culture, the concept of serving and taking on the responsibility for the welfare of the family is integral to the "fa'amatai" system. Various members of the family are called upon in turn to support their "matai" in carrying out their role and responsibilities according to Samoan tradition, cultural obligations and duty. This often involves the family contributing money and important cultural items such as ie toga" (fine mats) as well as food which the "matai" presents on behalf of the aiga" to ensure the family's obligations are met in their village or wider community. 
Men and women have equal rights to "matai" titles in Samoa, although the role of women in Samoan society means female "matai" comprise a relatively small percentage.
Before the advent of European contact and influence, the authority ("pule") of the "matai" extended to life and limb but this power has been altered and absorbed by a Western-style modern government (referred to as the "malo") where the "matai"'s authority is confined and balanced against the national governance.
"Ali'i" and "tulafale".
There are two types of "matai": "ali'i" (loosely translated "chief" or "high chief" depending on a specific title's rank) and "tulafale" (orator chief).
In former times the term "matai" applied only to "tulafale", but over time the term has become applied to "ali'i" generally.
Samoan "gafa" (pedigree, ancestors, descent) is central to family kinship and will usually commence from the person who first brought the name into prominence and caused it to be respected. It does not necessarily mean that the family commenced from the institution of a name or that the individual holding the title was the founder of the family. Former "matai" of the family have by comparison become unimportant and their names have fallen into disuse or become uninfluential.
The wife of an "ali'i" is referred to as "faletua". The wife of a "tulafale" (orator status "matai") is referred to as "tausi".
Orator chiefs.
Central to Samoan culture is the recording of history and genealogy which was achieved through oral history before the introduction of a written language. Orator chiefs ("tulafale") and speakers ("failauga" - 'speech-maker') are terms used for Samoans holding the position of speakers or mouthpieces of chiefs and they are found in all villages. Important "matai" titles are also tied to certain orator "matai" titles. Orators serve the means of conveying the wishes of chiefs to the people or speaking on behalf of the family, village or district on important occasions. The orator is the recorder of family histories and pedigree ("fa'alupega"), genealogies ("gafa") and events and is indispensable at public ceremonies. There are many Samoan public events at which the distribution of mats will take place. Many of these mats, particularly the fine mats ("'ie toga"), are valued very highly both from a monetary point of view and also from a historical and sentimental viewpoint. The more important mats bear respected names. The most noteworthy occasions on which mats are presented are marriages, births and deaths and the bestowal of a chiefly title.
Customary land.
The "matai" of the family is the administrator and representative of the family property which includes customary land. Most of the population in Samoa, 65% overall, live with their families in villages on customary land. However, the 2006 Samoa census showed that 34 out of 48 political districts had more than 80% of households living on customary land with the lowest figures (25%) in the more densely concentrated urbanised area around the capital Apia. On the island of Savai'i, where there are less people and fewer signs of western material culture, 93% of the 43,142 population live on customary land. 
Looking after the collective family land is one of the most important responsibilities of Samoan families and their "matai". 
A "matai" may make their wishes known and bequeath certain property to others such as a married daughter, but they cannot transfer land rights beyond their own. Under the management of one or more "matai" the lands are divided amongst the various families for their own use and are viewed by these family members as their unassailable rights. 
A Samoan proverb highlighting the importance of land in Samoa reads, "E le soifua umi le tagata fa'atau fanua" (The man who sells family land will not live to an old age - devils will bring about his early death).
With most of the country's land under customary ownership, the position of the "matai" is significant in modern day politics in Samoa in terms of the nation's economic development, conservation, sustainability, tourism, national infrastructure and access to natural resources such as water, forestry, road access, agriculture and farming. 
An example in recent years is the "matai" from the village of Sili on the island of Savai'i turning down a government proposal to build a hydroelectric plant on village land because of environmental concerns. In contrast, the "matai" in Sasina have agreed with government support to an unprecedented 120-year lease of prime oceanfront land to an American company to build a tourism resort estimated to cost US$450–500 million.
In conservation, the villages of Uafato in the Va'a-o-Fonoti district at the east end of Upolu island and Falealupo at the west end of Savai'i have agreed to conservation covenants for their native forests. 
Much of the land under the government today was alienated or sold during colonialism and later came under the Samoa government when the colonial era ended. This includes large tracts of plantation land from the 19th century as well as later periods of colonial administration including German Samoa (1900–1914) followed by the New Zealand administration. 
This has resulted in ongoing court cases for land claims between "matai" and the government, such as that of the village of Satapuala over land by Faleolo International Airport, disputes which directly impact upon the country's national infrastructure.
"Matai" selection.
In effect, every Samoan, male or female, is an heir to a "matai" title pertaining to their kinship and ancestry. However, "matai" titles are not automatically passed from a "matai" to their children or direct descendants but are bestowed upon those whom the extended family agree will best serve their needs while also ensuring that different branches of the family are represented. A recent example of this Samoan custom and law is the stripping of the important Malietoa title from the son of the previous title holder, the late Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II (1913–2007). Following Malietoa Tanumafili II's death in 2007, one branch of the family bestowed the title upon his son Papali'i Fa'amausili Moli in the village of Malie. The other branches of the family filed petitions at the Samoa Land and Titles Court claiming the bestowal invalid in breach of Samoan law. In June 2008, the court agreed and ruled the bestowal of the Malietoa title upon the son illegal, highlighting the unique nature of "matai" selection based on consensus, merit, custom and due process rather than automatic hereditary selection. Other cultural factors can also play a part in the complex decision making process including seniority in age (an important factor in Samoan society), leadership qualities, oratory and an individual's ability to contribute to the family's overall circumstances and well-being.
Title bestowal.
"Matai" titles ("suafa", literally "formal name") are bestowed upon family members during a cultural ceremony called a "saofa'i" which occurs only after discussion and consensus within the family. The "saofa'i" is a solemn ceremony which marks the formal acceptance of a new "matai" by their family and village into the circle of chiefs and orators. It involves the gathering of chiefs and orators in a "fale tele" meeting house, the exchanging of oratory speeches, the reciting of genealogies and a kava ceremony followed by a feast provided by the new "matai'"s family. Architecture of Samoa dictates seating positions inside the meeting house during the title bestowal including the position of those making the kava being situated at the rear. Once the ceremony is completed, the new "matai" is henceforth called by their new name.
In New Zealand, more people born in Samoa than any other foreign country officially change their names with the Department of Internal Affairs and it is believed that many of these are adding "matai" titles.
Non-Samoans.
"Matai" titles are sometimes conferred upon non-Samoans as an honour by Samoan families and their villages. An example is the title of 'Seiuli' conferred in 1993 by Samoa's Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II upon Barry Curtis, at the time Mayor of Manukau, a New Zealand city with a large Samoan population. Other non-Samoan New Zealanders bestowed with "matai" titles include prime ministers Robert Muldoon, David Lange and Jim Bolger, politician Winston Peters and Auckland businessman Dick Hubbard who holds the title 'Galumalemana.' In 1988, American ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox received a title from the village of Falealupo, where Cox had lived for many years and later helped to set up a covenant to protect the native rainforest. In 1978, the Governor-General of Fiji, Ratu Sir George Cakobau was bestowed the title 'Peseta' by Matautu on Savai'i island during his visit to Tui Fiti's sacred ground.
Naming convention.
A "matai" title is always first in naming convention as the most important name for a titled individual. When a person is appointed a "matai", they retain their Christian name in addition to their new "matai" title. The "matai" title is appended to the beginning of their name so that their Christian name follows their new "matai" title. As one person may hold a number of different "matai" names from different branches of their genealogy, the new names are also added before their Christian name, with no set order in terms of general usage. An example is Mata'afa Faumuina Fiame Mulinu'u I whose first three names reveal individual high chief titles and thereby his genealogy and the different villages and families to which he belonged; the Faumuina title from Lepea, the Fiame title from Lotofaga and the Mata'afa title, one of the paramount names in the country. 
As more than one family member can be bestowed the same "matai" title, each person's Christian name serves to distinguish them from each other. Dividing a family title so that it is shared among more than one family member is also agreed upon by consensus. The Samoans explain this by saying that a man has a "fasi igoa" – a piece of the title.
"Usoali'i" refers to brother chiefs, those men in the family union holding "matai" names. They may all enjoy the same rights or be under the control of one "matai" who is termed "sao", in which case the other chiefs are referred to as "tuaigoa".
Women "matai".
Of Samoa's total population of 187,820 (2011 census), 90,830 were female, comprising 48.4% of the population. The male (51.6%) to female (48.4%) ratio for the country is higher than the world ratio. In 2011, there were 1,766 female "matai", 10.5% of the 16,787 "matai" living in the country.
A woman can hold a "matai" name and have the "pule" (authority) of the family but this does not often occur. Should she have both she will usually bestow her "matai" title on one of her family, probably her husband, and retain the "pule".
In 2006, there were four female Members of Parliament in Samoa and three were cabinet ministers out of a 13-member cabinet.
Prominent women "matai" in Samoa include scholar and historian Aiono Fanaafi Le Tagaloa ("matai" title Aiono), high chief and senior cabinet minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa ("matai" title Fiame), politician Safuneitu'uga Pa'aga Neri ("matai" title Safuneitu'uga) and writer Letuimanu'asina Emma Kruse Va'ai ("matai" title Letuimanu'asina). 
With many Samoans also living overseas in other countries, other prominent Samoan female "matai" includes New Zealand former Member of Parliament Luamanuvao Winnie Laban ("matai" title Luamanuvao).
Old age.
Seniority in years and old age is a respectful status in Samoan society where elders, a familiar or complete stranger, are referred to as "tamā" (father) or "tinā" (mother). In this cultural context, a retired "matai" usually enjoys the respect of their family and is referred to as the "faatonutonu folau", the steersperson of the boat. In this case they do not actually do the steering but their advice is listened to and their family profits from their ripe experience.
Untitled men.
The Samoan appellation for a male person who is not a "matai" is a "taule'ale'a". The real meaning of the word, which is derived from the word "le'ale'a" (immature), is a young man who has not reached maturity. It is now-a-days applied to any male person who is not a "matai". In the past the term was sometimes used to indicate that any male person, even a "matai", was not an old man. In this sense, "taule'ale'a" signifies young or comparatively young, just as "toea'ina" is used to signify that a man is aged or elderly (a respectful status in Samoa) whether he be a "matai" or a "taule'ale'a".
It is permissible for a "taule'ale'a" (an untitled man) to change his name as often as he wishes. A chance remark or an outstanding incident will often be the determining factor in naming a "taule'ale'a". This can apply to everyone else, including females in Samoa, where a family member, especially a child, might be called a new name to commemorate an important occasion.
Disputes resolution.
Disputes over "matai" titles which cannot be resolved among family members within the wide extended 'aiga are dealt with by the Samoa Land and Titles Court which consists of cultural and judicial experts appointed by the Supreme Court of Samoa. 
The Land and Titles Court hears disputes over "matai" title succession as well as disagreements pertaining to customary land. The court derives from the Native Land and Titles Court put in place under the colonial German administration in 1901. Samoa's political stability is thought to be due in large part to the success of this court in hearing disputes.

Oxford University Amateur Boxing Club

The Oxford University Amateur Boxing Club (OUABC) is the boxing club of the University of Oxford, England, located in Oxford. The club was founded in 1881. It is the second oldest active amateur boxing club in the UK. Several OUABC boxers were featured in a 2006 documentary titled "Blue Blood".
The club competes against Cambridge University Amateur Boxing Club in The Varsity Match, also known as The True Love Bowl, each year. Typically, the match location switches between Oxford and Cambridge, though some matches have been held in London. In fact the first match held in London, was captained by D.M.L. Doran Pembroke College in 1937. It was in this year the boxing team was doubled in size by this captain. This was the last year only a Half Blue was awarded and why the team blazers were striped blue and white to signify this. Since this year male boxers who compete in the Varsity Match are traditionally awarded a Full Blue by the Oxford University Men's Blues Committee.
In 2003/2004, OUABC began including female boxers in training and matches. In the 2005 Varsity Match, Kaleen Love of Oxford defeated Catherine Tubb of Cambridge to become the first Oxford woman to compete in a varsity boxing match. Both were awarded Extraordinary Full Blues for their athletic accomplishments. More recently, Sarah Burden and Helena Matthews of CUABC were awarded the same honours for their achievements.
During the 1980s and 1990s, under the tutelage of head coach Henry Dean, OUABC won 17 Varsity Matches in a row, the longest single stretch of victories in the history of the tournament. However, since then the Match results have been more balanced - and in both the 2005 and 2009 Varsity Matches, OUABC registered defeats by the maximum 9-0 margin. Cambridge University Amateur Boxing Club (CUABC) remains the only side to have achieved this feat since the number of bouts was increased to 9 in the 1950s. Cambridge has now taken to hosting the Match every second year in London, due to seating limitations at Cambridge venues, with the 2009 Match recorded for a documentary aired on Channel 4. The 2010 Varsity Match was hosted by Oxford in the Oxford Town Hall, with Cambridge hosting the 2011 Varsity Match in The Troxy, London.
The running Varsity Match total, as of 2013, now stands at 51-51.
OUABC practices in the Iffley Road University Gym in Oxfordshire.

Demosthenes Philalethes

Demosthenes Philalethes (Gr. ) was an ancient Greek physician of Asia Minor who was one of the pupils of Alexander Philalethes, a contemporary of Aristoxenus, and a follower of the teachings of Herophilos. He succeeded Alexander as the head of the Herophilean school of medicine in Carura. He probably lived around the beginning of the 1st century, and was especially celebrated for his skill as an oculist. He was the author of the most influential ophthalmological work of antiquity, the "Ophthalmicus", on diseases of the eye, which appears to have been still extant in the Middle Ages, but of which nothing now remains, although some extracts are preserved by Aëtius Amidenus, Paul of Aegina, Rufus of Ephesus, and other later writers. He also wrote a work on the pulse, which is quoted by Galen. Demosthenes was the last known Herophilean in Asia Minor.

Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out

"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" is a blues standard written by Jimmy Cox in 1923. Its lyric, told from the point of view of a one-time millionaire during the Prohibition era, reflects on the fleeting nature of material wealth and the friendships that come and go with it. As a vaudeville-style blues, it was popularized by Bessie Smith, the preeminent female blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s. Since her 1929 recording, it has been interpreted by numerous musicians in a variety of styles.
Lyrics and composition.
When "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" was composed in 1923 by Jimmy Cox, the "Roaring Twenties" were coming into full swing. After the post-World War I recession, a new era of prosperity was experienced in the U.S. and elsewhere. However, in the face of all the optimism, Cox wrote a cautionary tale about the fickle nature of fortune and its attendant relationships:
The song is a moderate-tempo blues with ragtime-influences, which follows an eight-bar progression:
Early recordings.
Although "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" was published in 1923, the first known recording did not appear until 1927. Piedmont blues musician Bobby Leecan, who recorded with various ensembles, such as the South Street Trio, Dixie Jazzers Washboard Band, and Fats Waller's Six Hot Babies, recorded an early rendition of the song as Blind Bobby Baker, with his vocal and fingerpicking-style guitar. His version, recorded in New York around June 1927, was titled "Nobody Needs You When You're Down and Out" and used some different lyrics with emphasis on the hard times (Perfect 133, Pathé Actuelle 7533).
On January 15, 1929, influential boogie-woogie pianist Pinetop Smith recorded "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" in Chicago (Vocalion 1256). In it the lyrics are spoken rather than sung to Smith's piano accompaniment. The song is one of eleven-known recordings by Smith, who died two months after he recorded it.
Bessie Smith song.
Bessie Smith recorded the song on May 15, 1929 in New York. Unlike the earlier versions, Bessie Smith recorded the song with instrumental accompaniment, including a small horn section. When Smith's record was released on September 13, 1929 (a Friday), the lyrics turned out to be oddly prophetic. The New York stock market had reached an all-time high less than two weeks earlier, only to go into its biggest decline two weeks later in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which signaled the beginning of the ten-year Great Depression.
Bessie Smith's "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" became one of her biggest hits, but was released before "race records" were tracked by record industry publications, such as "Billboard" magazine. Today, it "more than any other, is the song that most people associate with Bessie Smith".
1930s–1960s renditions.
Due to the popularity of Bessie Smith's recording, numerous musicians began interpreting the song in recordings of their own. The song became an early standard with jazz and blues artists, such as the Count Basie Orchestra, Louis Jordan And His Tympany Five, Sidney Bechet, Eddie Condon, Josh White, Julia Lee, and Lead Belly. In the late 1950s – early 1960s, it again became popular with the American folk music revival, with recordings by Eric Von Schmidt, Odetta, Chad Mitchell Trio, and an early demo by Janis Joplin with Jorma Kaukonen. In 1960, a version by Nina Simone reached number 23 in the Billboard R&B chart as well as number 93 in the Hot 100 pop chart. In the mid-1960s, soul versions were recorded by Sam Cooke and Otis Redding; rock versions by the Spencer Davis Group, pre-Allman Brothers Band Duane Allman and Gregg Allman, and Them; and a French version by Nino Ferrer (as "Le Millionnaire").
Eric Clapton versions.
During his art student days in the early 1960s, Eric Clapton was attracted to London's folk-music scene and the fingerpicking acoustic guitar-style of Big Bill Broonzy. Along with "Key to the Highway", "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" was one of the first songs that Clapton learned to play in this style. In 1970, he recorded a group version with his band, Derek and the Dominos, for their debut album "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs". The recording took place at the Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida with Jim Gordon (drums), Carl Radle (bass), 
Bobby Whitlock (organ), and Duane Allman (slide guitar). As Whitlock recalled, Sam the Sham, who was also recording at Criteria, suggested that they record the song.
Allman had recorded "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" earlier with his brother Gregg and used similar guitar lines for the Derek and the Dominos recording. Whitlock also noted that Clapton played through a Fender Champ guitar amplifier (a five-watt practice amp), while Allman used a Fender Twin.
Shortly after the studio recording, the song became part of the Dominos live set. Although it did not appear on their 1973 "In Concert" album, a recording from the Fillmore East on October 24, 1970 was later included on the expanded "Live at the Fillmore" album released in 1994. For this version, Clapton played all the guitar parts and Whitlock performed on piano. In 1992, Clapton recorded another rendition for the "MTV Unplugged" series. In keeping with the show's theme, the song was performed in an acoustic style. Clapton recounted: "I also enjoyed going back and playing the old stuff like 'Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out', which was how it all started back in Kingston so long ago".
Later recordings.
"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" continues to be recorded by many musicians in different styles. To illustrate their variety, some examples include: Dick Hyman, Tom Jones, B.B. King, Katie Melua, Emmy Rossum, Archie Shepp and Horace Parlan, Rod Stewart, and Dave Van Ronk.

A Horseman Riding By

A Horseman Riding By is a 1966 novel by R. F. Delderfield that starts in 1902 at the tail end of the Boer War and is continued in the sequel to end in the summer of 1965. It is set in Devon in the early 20th century. It was to some extent an elegy for the traditional society which was blown apart by the First World War. Delderfield wrote at least one sequel, some accounts describe it as part of a trilogy, but this may be due to confusion because it was published in two parts in the USA.
It was made into a BBC television serial in 1978. The BBC did not adapt the remainder of the series of novels, but a few years later they adapted two more of Delderfield's novels, "To Serve Them All My Days" and "Diana".
"Long Summer Day".
The first novel is “Long Summer Day”. The novels are all set in south Devon, where the main character, Paul Craddock buys an estate after serving with the Imperial Yeomanry in the Boer War. The first novel covers the years of the long “Edwardian afternoon” after the death of Queen Victoria and follows the trials and tribulations of Craddock, and later his second wife and their growing family.
"Post of Honour".
The second novel “Post of Honour” covers the years from 1914 through to May 1940 with the Dunkirk evacuation. However the first chapter catches up with the main characters and events from 1911 to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The second novel finishes with the “Miracle of Dunkirk” with Craddock’s eldest son Simon (his son from his brief first marriage) returning safely from France.
"The Green Gauntlet".
The third and final novel “The Green Gauntlet” is in two sections, part one picks up the story of the Craddock family in February 1942 and runs through the rest of the Second World War and the culmination of the D Day landings, the story then takes us on to the end of the war just before V.E. Day. Part two gets underway with the V.E. Day celebrations in May 1945, then follows the Craddock family fortunes through the 1950s and up until the funeral of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965

Animal nutrition

Animal nutrition focuses on the dietary needs of domesticated animals, primarily those in agriculture and food production.
Introduction to animal nutrition.
There are seven major classes of nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, fibre, minerals, protein, vitamin, and water.
These nutrient classes can be categorized as either macronutrients (needed in relatively large amounts) or micronutrients (needed in smaller quantities). The macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, proteins, and water. The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.
The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and energy. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in joules or calories (sometimes called "kilocalories" and on other rare occasions written with a capital "C" to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17 kJ approximately (4 kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37 kJ (9 kcal) per gram., though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class dietary material, fiber (i.e., non-digestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear.
Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex polysaccharides (starch). Fats are triglycerides, made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are essential in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation.
Other micronutrients include antioxidants and phytochemicals which are said to influence (or protect) some body systems. Their necessity is not as well established as in the case of, for instance, vitamins.
Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient classes, together with other substances such as toxins or various sorts. Some nutrients can be stored internally (e.g., the fat soluble vitamins), while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or, in extreme cases, too much of a required nutrient. For example, both salt and water (both absolutely required) will cause illness or even death in too large amounts.
Carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They constitute a large part of foods such as rice, noodles, bread, and other grain-based products.
Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Polysaccharides are often referred to as "complex" carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple branched chains of sugar units. The difference is that complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption. The spike in blood glucose levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases which have become more frequent in recent times. Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than formerly, perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease. The degree of causation is still not clear, however.
Fat.
A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with "trans"-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation.
Many studies have shown that unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, are best in the human diet. Saturated fats, typically from animal sources, are next, while trans fats are to be avoided. Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as butter or lard), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as olive oil or flaxseed oil). Trans fats are very rare in nature, but have properties useful in the food processing industry, such as rancid resistance.
Essential fatty acids.
Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids -— omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids -— seems also important for health, though definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (LNA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g. weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins: one reason a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.
The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e. cell division).
Good sources of essential fatty acids include most vegetables, nuts, seeds, and marine oils, Some of the best sources are fish, flax seed oils, soy beans, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and walnuts.
Fiber.
Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate (or a polysaccharide) that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. But in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible because humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fibre. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fibre. Fibre is important to digestive health and is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer. For mechanical reasons it can help in alleviating both constipation and diarrhea. Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and insoluble fiber especially stimulates peristalsis—the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract. Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high viscosity; this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Protein.
Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enyzmes which control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of amino acids which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are "essential" (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are "non-essential" (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential, and therefore must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A "complete" protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an "incomplete" protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.
It is possible to combine two incomplete protein sources (e.g. rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. Sources of dietary protein include meats, tofu and other soy-products, eggs, grains, legumes, and dairy products such as milk and cheese. A few amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis; this is done in quantity only during starvation. The amino acids remaining after such conversion are discarded.
Minerals.
Dietary minerals are the chemical elements required by living organisms, other than the four elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned—including several metals, which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells). Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter.
Macrominerals.
Many elements are essential in relative quantity; they are usually called "bulk minerals". Some are structural, but many play a role as electrolytes. Elements with recommended dietary allowance (RDA) greater than 200 mg/day are, in alphabetical order (with informal or folk-medicine perspectives in parentheses):
Trace minerals.
Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes. Some trace mineral elements (RDA < 200 mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:
Vitamins.
As with the minerals discussed above, some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. (Vitamin D is the exception: it can alternatively be synthesized in the skin, in the presence of UVB radiation.) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as carnitine, are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not "essential" dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different phytochemicals have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including antioxidant activity (see below); experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include essential amino acids (see above), choline, essential fatty acids (see above), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.
Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions: goitre, scurvy, osteoporosis, impaired immune system, disorders of cell metabolism, certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature aging, and poor psychological health (including eating disorders), among many others. Excess of some vitamins is also dangerous to health (notably vitamin A), and for at least one vitamin, B6, toxicity begins at levels not far above the required amount.
Deficiency or excess of minerals can also have serious health consequences.
Water.
About 70% of the non-fat mass of the human body is made of water. Analysis of Adipose Tissue in Relation to Body Weight Loss in Man. Retrieved from Journal of Applied To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss increases and daily fluid needs will eventually increase as well.
It is not fully clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, although some experts assert that 8–10 glasses of water (approximately 2 liters) daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. The notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source. The effect of, greater or lesser, water intake on weight loss and on constipation is also still unclear. The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read: "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods." The latest dietary reference intake report by the United States National Research Council recommended, generally, (including food sources): 2.7 liters of water total for women and 3.7 liters for men. Specifically, pregnant and breastfeeding women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. According to the Institute of Medicine—who recommend that, on average, women consume 2.2 litres and men 3.0 litres—this is recommended to be 2.4 litres (approx. 9 cups) for pregnant women and 3 litres (approx. 12.5 cups) for breastfeeding women since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing.
For those who have healthy kidneys, it is somewhat difficult to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, however, putting them at risk of water intoxication, which can be fatal. In particular large amounts of de-ionized water are dangerous.
Normally, about 20 percent of water intake comes in food, while the rest comes from drinking water and assorted beverages (caffeinated included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including urine and feces, sweating, and by water vapor in the exhaled breath.
Other nutrients.
Other micronutrients include antioxidants and phytochemicals. These substances are generally more recent discoveries which have not yet been recognized as vitamins or as required. Phytochemicals may act as antioxidants, but not all phytochemicals are antioxidants.
Antioxidants.
Antioxidants are a recent discovery. As cellular metabolism/energy production requires oxygen, potentially damaging (e.g. mutation causing) compounds known as free radicals can form. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e. acceptors of electrons) and some react very strongly. For normal cellular maintenance, growth, and division, these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds. Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors (glutathione, Vitamin C) and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, Vitamin A, Vitamin K) or produced by the body from other compounds (Beta-carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body, Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight). Phytochemicals ("Section Below") and their subgroup polyphenols are the majority of antioxidants; about 4,000 are known. Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network, e.g. vitamin C can reactivate free radical-containing glutathione or vitamin E by accepting the free radical itself, and so on. Some antioxidants are more effective than others at neutralizing different free radicals. Some cannot neutralize certain free radicals. Some cannot be present in certain areas of free radical development (Vitamin A is fat-soluble and protects fat areas, Vitamin C is water soluble and protects those areas). When interacting with a free radical, some antioxidants produce a different free radical compound that is less dangerous or more dangerous than the previous compound. Having a variety of antioxidants allows any byproducts to be safely dealt with by more efficient antioxidants in neutralizing a free radical's butterfly effect.
Phytochemicals.
A growing area of interest is the effect upon human health of trace chemicals, collectively called phytochemicals. These nutrients are typically found in edible plants, especially colorful fruits and vegetables, but also other organisms including seafood, algae, and fungi. The effects of phytochemicals increasingly survive rigorous testing by prominent health organizations. One of the principal classes of phytochemicals are polyphenol antioxidants, chemicals which are known to provide certain health benefits to the cardiovascular system and immune system. These chemicals are known to down-regulate the formation of reactive oxygen species, key chemicals in cardiovascular disease.
Perhaps the most rigorously tested phytochemical is zeaxanthin, a yellow-pigmented carotenoid present in many yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. Repeated studies have shown a strong correlation between ingestion of zeaxanthin and the prevention and treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Less rigorous studies have proposed a correlation between zeaxanthin intake and cataracts.</ref> A second carotenoid, lutein, has also been shown to lower the risk of contracting AMD. Both compounds have been observed to collect in the retina when ingested orally, and they serve to protect the rods and cones against the destructive effects of light.
Another carotenoid, beta-cryptoxanthin, appears to protect against chronic joint inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis. While the association between serum blood levels of beta-cryptoxanthin and substantially decreased joint disease has been established, neither a convincing mechanism for such protection nor a cause-and-effect have been rigorously studied.Am J Epidemiology 2006 163(1).</ref> Similarly, a red phytochemical, lycopene, has substantial credible evidence of negative association with development of prostate cancer.
The correlations between the ingestion of some phytochemicals and the prevention of disease are, in some cases, enormous in magnitude.
Even when the evidence is obtained, translating it to practical dietary advice can be difficult and counter-intuitive. Lutein, for example, occurs in many yellow and orange fruits and vegetables and protects the eyes against various diseases. However, it does not protect the eye nearly as well as zeaxanthin, and the presence of lutein in the retina will prevent zeaxanthin uptake. Additionally, evidence has shown that the lutein present in egg yolk is more readily absorbed than the lutein from vegetable sources, possibly because of fat solubility. At the most basic level, the question "should you eat eggs?" is complex to the point of dismay, including misperceptions about the health effects of cholesterol in egg yolk, and its saturated fat content.
As another example, lycopene is prevalent in tomatoes (and actually is the chemical that gives tomatoes their red color). It is more highly concentrated, however, in processed tomato products such as commercial pasta sauce, or tomato soup, than in fresh "healthy" tomatoes. Yet, such sauces tend to have high amounts of salt, sugar, other substances a person may wish or even need to avoid.
The following table presents phytochemical groups and common sources, arranged by family: 
Ash.
Though not really a nutrient as such, an entry for "ash" is sometimes found on nutrition labels, especially for pet food. This entry measures the weight of inorganic material left over after the food is burned for two hours at 600°C. Thus, it does not include water, fibre, and nutrients that provide calories, but it does include some nutrients, such as minerals 
There have been some concerns that too much ash may contribute to feline urological syndrome in domestic cats.
Intestinal bacterial flora.
It is now also known that animal intestines contain a large population of gut flora. In humans, these include species such as "Bacteroides", "L. acidophilus" and "E. coli", among many others. They are essential to digestion, and are also affected by the food we eat. Bacteria in the gut perform many important functions for humans, including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of otherwise indigestible food; stimulating cell growth; repressing the growth of harmful bacteria, training the immune system to respond only to pathogens; producing vitamin B12, and defending against some infectious diseases.

Hangikjöt

Hangikjöt (; lit. "hung meat") is a traditional festive food in Iceland, served at Christmas.
Etymology and History.
This Icelandic smoked lamb, mutton, or horse meat is usually boiled and served either hot or cold in slices, traditionally with potatoes in béchamel sauce and green peas, or in thin slices on bread such as "flatkaka" or "rúgbrauð" or "Laufabrauð". It takes its name from the old tradition of smoking food in order to preserve it by hanging it from the rafters of a smoking shed.
Sometimes, bits of string are present in the meat, those are tied around the meat to compress it and hold it together as it is being smoked; the strings are not eaten.
There are several types of hangikjöt. The meat can come from various parts of the sheep, but the most common is the hind legs. A whole leg on the bone, with an adequate layer of fat, is by many considered the best of all, although others prefer the convenience of a boned roll of meat or want most of the fat trimmed off.
Commercial Form.
In recent years other types have become available, such as "tvíreykt" ("twice smoked") hangikjöt, i.e. lamb or mutton that has been smoked for a longer period of time and is more like the old country hangikjöt which often hung high above the kitchen fire for many months. This is usually served raw in thin slices, sometimes in a manner similar to the Italian "prosciutto", with melon. Modern commercial hangikjöt is usually fairly lightly smoked. The two main types are either smoked with Icelandic birch or with dried sheep dung.
A recent survey established that around 90% of all Icelanders eat hangikjöt at least once over the holidays.
Smoked Mutton was known as Macon in the UK, but is not common.

Codex Ebnerianus

Codex Ebnerianus, "Minuscule 105" (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), δ 257 (Soden), is a Greek language illuminated manuscript of the New Testament, though missing the Book of Revelation. 
Formerly it was labeled by 105e, 48a, and 24p. 
Description.
It is believed written in Constantinople at the start of the 12thC during the Comnenian Period. It is unique amongst surviving Greek New Testament manuscripts in that it places author portraits before each epistle, act and gospel, as opposed to just the gospels. This manuscript gives a good example of Greek calligraphy of the 12th century. 
The text is written in 1 column per page, 27 lines per page, on 426 parchment leaves (20.5 by 16 cm). Capital letters in gold.
The book itself was bound in silver inlaid with ivory and comprises 426 leaves of vellum in quarto (20.5 by 16 cm). It contains Epistula ad Carpianum, the Eusebian Tables, tables of the κεφαλαια, the τιτλοι, numbers of the κεφαλαια at the margin, the Ammonian Sections, but not o references to the Eusebian Canons, subscriptions at the end, στιχοι, and the Nicene Creed all in gold.
Synaxarion and Menologion were added by Joasaph, a calligraphist, in 1391, who also added John 8:3-11 at the end of that Gospel.
The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Aland placed it in Category V. It belongs to the textual family Family Kx.
History.
The codex is named after Hieronymus Wilhelm Ebner von Eschenbach (1673–1752); a Nuremberg diplomat and German Enlightenment historian, who founded a library using his extensive collection. 
Formerly it was labeled by 105e, 48a, and 24p. In 1908 Gregory gave for it number 105.
It is currently housed at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, ("MS. Auct. T. inf. 1. 10").

James H. Manning (January 31, 1862 – October 22, 1929) was a Major League Baseball player and manager. Though he was primarily an outfielder, Manning was an early utility player, playing games at three infield positions (second base, shortstop, and third base) throughout his career. He played four years in the National League with the Boston Beaneaters and the Detroit Wolverines, then played one year in the American Association with the Kansas City Cowboys. He managed the Washington Senators in their inaugural season ().
After retiring from playing baseball, he was hired as the first manager of the Washington Senators of the new American League in 1901, but he resigned after only one season in which the Senators went 61–73. He never managed again, and died at age 67 in Edinburg, Texas.

ArchiMate

ArchiMate ( ) is an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language to support the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains in an unambiguous way.
ArchiMate is a technical standard from The Open Group and is based on the concepts of the IEEE 1471 standard. It is supported by various tool vendors and consulting firms. ArchiMate is also a registered trademark of The Open Group.
The Open Group has a certification program for ArchiMate users, software tools and courses.
ArchiMate distinguishes itself from other languages such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) by its enterprise modelling scope.
Overview.
Just like an architectural drawing in classical building architecture describes the various aspects of the construction and use of a building, ArchiMate offers a common language for describing the construction and operation of business processes, organizational structures, information flows, IT systems, and technical infrastructure. This insight helps the different stakeholders to design, assess, and communicate the consequences of decisions and changes within and between these business domains.
An architecture framework is used to structure the concepts and relationships of the ArchiMate language. It divides the enterprise architecture into a business, application and technology layer. In each layer, three aspects are considered: active elements that exhibit behavior (e.g. Process and Function), an internal structure and elements that define use or communicate information.
One of the objectives of the ArchiMate language is to define the relationships between concepts in different architecture domains. The concepts of this language therefore hold the middle between the detailed concepts, that are used for modeling individual domains, for example, the UML for modeling software products., and BPMN which is used for business process modeling.
History.
ArchiMate is partly based on the IEEE 1471 standard. It was developed in the Netherlands by a project team from the Telematica Instituut in cooperation with several Dutch partners from government, industry and academia. Among the partners were Ordina, Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen, the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) and the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI). Later, tests were performed in organizations such as ABN AMRO, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration and the ABP. 
The development process lasted from July 2002 to December 2004, and took about 35 man years and approximately 4 million euros. The development was funded by the Dutch government (Dutch Tax and Customs Administration), and business partners, including ABN AMRO and the ABP Pension Fund.
In 2008 the ownership and stewardship of ArchiMate was transferred to the Open Group. It is now managed by the
ArchiMate Forum within The Open Group.
In February 2009 The Open Group published the ArchiMate® 1.0 standard as a formal technical standard. In January 2012 the ArchiMate® 2.0 standard, and in 2013 the ArchiMate® 2.1 standard was released.
ArchiMate topics.
ArchiMate is an integrated architectural approach that describes and visualises the different business domains and their relations. Using these integrated architectures aids stakeholders in assessing the impact of design choices and changes.
Architecture.
Organisations need to adapt increasingly fast and anticipate changing customer requirements and business goals. This need influences the entire chain of activities of a business, from the organisational structure to the network infrastructure. How can you control the impact of these changes? Architecture may be the answer. 
Architecture is a consistent whole of principles, methods and models that are used in the design and realisation of organisational structure, business processes, information systems, and infrastructure. However, these domains are not approached in an integrated way, which makes it difficult to judge the effects of proposed changes. Every domain speaks its own language, draws its own models, and uses its own techniques and tools. Communication and decision making across domains is seriously impaired.
ArchiMate provides this integration. ArchiMate is an architecture language and visualisation techniques that picture these domains and their relations. ArchiMate will provide the architect with instruments that support and improve the architecture process.
Layers.
ArchiMate has layered and service-oriented look on architectural models. The higher layers make use of services that are provided by the lower layers. Although, at an abstract level, the concepts that are used within each layer are similar, we define more concrete concepts that are specific for a certain layer. In this context, we distinguish three main layers:
Each of these main layers can be further divided in sub-layers. For example, in the Business layer, the primary business processes realising the products of a company may make use of a layer of secondary (supporting) business processes; in the Application layer, the end-user applications may make use of generic services offered by supporting applications. On top of the Business layer, a separate Environment layer may be added, modelling the external customers that make use of the services of the organisation (although these may also be considered part of the Business layer).
In line with service orientation, the most important relation between layers is formed by use relations, which show how the higher layers make use of the services of lower layers. However, a second type of link is formed by realisation relations: elements in lower layers may realise comparable elements in higher layers; e.g., a ‘data object’ (Application layer) may realise a ‘business object’ (Business layer); or an ‘artifact’ (Technology layer) may realise either a ‘data object’ or an ‘application component’ (Application layer).
General structure of models within the different layers.
The general structure of models within the different layers is similar. The same types of concepts and relations are used, although their exact nature and granularity differ.
First, we distinguish the structural or static aspect and the behavioural or dynamic aspect. Behavioural concepts are assigned to structural concepts, to show who or what displays the behaviour. In the example, role, interface and collaboration are assigned to business process, organisational service and business interaction, respectively.
Second, we make a distinction between an external view and an internal view on systems. When looking at the behavioural aspect, these views reflect the principles of service orientation as introduced in the previous section. The service concept represents a unit of essential functionality that a system exposes to its environment. For the external users, only this external functionality, together with non-functional aspects such as the quality of service, costs etc., are relevant. If required, these can be specified in a contract or service level agreement. Services are accessible through interfaces, which constitute the external view on the structural aspect.
Although for the external users only the external view is relevant, the design of organisations or systems and their internal operations and management also requires knowledge about the internal realisation of the services and interfaces. For this realisation, we make a distinction between behaviour that is performed by an individual structural element (e.g., actor, role component, etc.), or collective behaviour (interaction) that is performed by a collaboration of multiple structural elements.
In addition to active structural elements (the business actors, application components and devices that display actual behaviour, i.e., the ‘subjects’ of activity), we also recognise passive structural elements, i.e., the objects on which behaviour is performed. In the domain of information-intensive organisations, which is the main focus of our language, these are usually information objects in the business layer and data objects in the application layer, but they may also be used to represent physical objects.

Martha Llwyd

Martha Llwyd (1766 – 16 October 1845) was a Welsh poet and hymnist, born in the small Carmarthenshire village of Cynwyl Elfed. 
Despite being unable to read or write, Martha Llwyd composed many hymns and poems which she kept in her memory and taught to others. Her hymns became very popular and were sung far and wide during her lifetime. She was regularly visited by the Methodist leader and fellow hymn-writer William Williams Pantycelyn to discuss their work, and it is alleged that some of her hymns were published under his name. Sadly, very little of Martha Llwyd's work remains, and most of her hymns have been lost to posterity.
Martha was born Martha Williams at Nantbendigaid Farm in the parish of Cynwyl Elfed, but her family moved to Y Felin farm in the neighbouring parish of Llanpumsaint when she was a baby and it was there that she grew up. In 1785 she married Dafydd Llwyd, a local blacksmith and prominent member of the village's Methodist community. The couple lived together in the centre of the village and had nine children - six boys and three girls. The rigours of raising such a large family took its toll on Martha's health and with time she became severely crippled. Nevertheless, she was a faithful member of Bethel Methodist Chapel in the village of Llanpumsaint and was often seen outdoors, carried aloft in her chair by her children or neighbours. 
Martha died at the age of 79, only one year after the death of her husband Dafydd Llwyd. They share a grave under the yew tree at the parish church in Llanpumsaint. It is inscribed with the anglicised form of their names: David and Martha Lloyd.

Feast of the First Fruits of Wine

The Feast of the First Fruits of Wine is a holiday celebrated by the ancient Israelites as described in the Temple Scroll of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The holiday, which is observed on the third day of the fifth month (Av), is not mentioned in the Bible. The date is significant because it is exactly 50 days after the 15th of Sivan, the festival of Weeks. 
On this holiday, the Israelites were commanded to bring their first fruits of the grapes to the Temple as an offering. This holiday was a very happy day because "the wine gets atonement on this day" and was commanded to be observed as an annual celebration perpetually. After this holiday, the children of Israel were permitted to eat from their grape vines, whether the grapes were ripe or still unripe, because after the observances of this holiday, they had made a full atonement for the wine. It so happens that this day coincides with the modern Jewish period called "The Nine Days", a time when mourning practices take place and when wine and meat are prohibited. 
This holiday is not observed by any known modern Jewish group today.

Srigim

Srigim (. lit. "Shoots"), also known as Li On (), is a communal settlement in central Israel. Located to the south of Beit Shemesh. It falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Yehuda Regional Council. In 2007 it had a population of 1,100. It borders the British Park forest and the biblical Elah Valley where David fought Goliath.
The village was established in 1960 by residents of moshavim in the region, and was planned to become a regional centre. It was named after grapevines, which are common in the area. In 1996 Srigim was enlarged to include 200 families who sought to turn it into an ecological village. It boasts dozens of artists and hosts an arts fair twice a year. It has a boutique winery, a microbrewery and an olive oil mill.

Tourism in the Central African Republic

Tourism in the Central African Republic has been negatively affected by its recent troubled history and fighting in neighbouring countries. Security in the country is unstable, particularly in its north and northwest. 
In 2007 and 2008 the United States issued a travel warning for the CAR warning of bandits, armed groups of rebels, and poachers particularly outside of the capital Bangui. The country's government cannot guarantee the safety of travellers in most of the country. In April 2007, a hunting party near Ndele town was attacked and a French hunter was killed and three others were injured.
The Central African Republic is a landlocked and remote country, and a lack of air access makes it an expensive destination. The only international airport is Bangui M'poko International Airport. Locations in the country attractive to travellers include the Chutes De Boali, waterfalls of a height of 50 m (164 ft). 
Dzanga-Sangha National Park in the south west of the country has gorillas and elephants. The Baka people live in this area. Bayanga beside the Sangha River is the main village near to the national park. The village has some small guesthouses and a lodge. The best time to visit most of the country is from November to April.

<doc id="18761610" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18761610" title="MV Rocknes (2001)">
MV Rocknes (2001)

MV "Rocknes" was a -long rock discharge vessel that hit shallow water and suddenly capsized south of Bergen, Norway on 19 January 2004, killing 18 members of its 30-person crew. At the time of its sinking, it was the world's largest dynamically positioned flexible fall pipe rock dumping vessel. The ship was repaired during 2004 and 2005 and renamed Nordnes.
"Rocknes" was owned by Kvitnes Shipping Company Ltd. of St. Johns, a part of the Hartmann group of Cadenberge, Germany. The ship was on a long-term charter to Van Oord ACZ, an international contractor specializing in dredging, rock dumping, and offshore and coastal construction.
Conversion.
Conversion of the ship was commissioned on 3 May 2003 in response to the increasing demand for offshore rock dumping. The ship was converted from the self unloading bulk carrier MV "Kvitnes" at Keppel Verolme Shipyard, Botlek, The Netherlands. The actual conversion was led by a design team formed by Van Oord ACZ. Post-conversion, the ship remained a capable bulk carrier, albeit with a reduction in cargo capacity and a loss of of sailing speed.
Conversion was scheduled for a maximum of 112 days, and was completed in 124 days, 12 days later than planned.
Design challenges.
Its large size (largest in the world at the time of its construction) created unique design challenges.
In order to create an economically feasible vessel of this size, the vessel must be designed with a high deadweight tonnage and a relatively high sailing speed to allow large quantities of rock, with densities ranging from per cubic meter or per cubic yard, to be rapidly transported to deeper waters farther from shore.
Because of the density of the rock, the ship must include large void spaces located ahead of, astern of, and to either side of the cargo holds in the hull to provide sufficient stability.
The holds themselves are loaded from above through hatches by shore-based equipment. They are designed with sloping sides and bottoms to allow them to be self-trimming and self-unloading via a conveyor belt running the length of the holds along the centerline of the ship at their lowest point.
The conveyors transport the rock to the forward part of the ship, into a rock hopper, then into flexible fall pipes that extend out of the ship's bottom through a moon pool. The ends of the fall pipes are fitted with purpose-built, state of the art remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) which ensure that the fall pipes are accurately guided along the cable or pipeline, ensuring highly precise deposition of protective rock ballast. These ROVs can also be used for dredging, trenching, and jetting tools.
The large quantity of heavy equipment mounted above the main deck of the ship raises its center of gravity and reduces its transverse stability.
Sinking.
MV "Rocknes" hit shallow water and suddenly capsized south of Bergen, Norway, while on her way to Emden in Germany, killing 18 of 30 crew. She remained afloat upside-down.
Salvage.
The Dutch salvaging company Smit International was hired to salvage the ship. As she had remained afloat upsite down, a plan was designed to parbuckle the vessel, an exceptional approach for a ship of this size. Cables were attached from the 9000-ton vessel to two barges that had been specially prepared for this operation. After turning the vessel upright again, she was towed into the harbour of Bergen and after repairs the bulk-carrier was put back in operation
In the media.
The sinking of the "Rocknes" was broadcast on Discovery Channel in an episode of "Blueprint for Disaster" (in Europe broadcast under the name "Minutes from Disaster").

He received a master's degree in law enforcement and justice administration from Western Illinois University, completing a thesis on medical marijuana. As a student, Eyre was active in the College Libertarians, Alpha Phi Sigma, and Phi Kappa Phi. He interned with the Cato Institute and was a Koch Fellow at the Drug Policy Alliance. He then worked at the Institute for Humane Studies for two and a half years, where he served as director of the Campus Network program.
Eyre took over the Crasher-in-Chief position at Bureaucrash. He left that position on April 1 of 2009 to and started the Motorhome Diaries project with his friends Jason Talley and Adam Mueller. In January 2010 he, Talley, and Mueller founded Cop Block, an organization that videotapes police in the performance of their duties. He later worked as an outreach consultant for the Future of Freedom Foundation and was involved in the Free Keene movement and Free State Project in New Hampshire.
Liberty on Tour.
Between August and November 2010, Eyre and Ademo Freeman embarked on a natiowide tour called "Liberty on Tour". Over 13 weeks they visited 13 major cities: New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Denver, Salt Lake City, San Diego, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Austin, New Orleans, Jones County, Atlanta, and Miami. During their trip they were arrested for videotaping a police stop.
On January 24, 2010 Eyre was arrested for refusing to remove his hat in a courtroom in Keene, New Hampshire. The arrest was captured on video and posted on several social media outlets online, and also led to the creation of freepete.org.

Craig Henderson

Craig Charles Glendinning Henderson (born ) is a New Zealander football player who plays for Stabæk. His hometown is Stokes Valley, Lower Hutt. He attended Taita College, Lower Hutt where he was Head Boy, Dux and Sportsman of the Year in 2004.
Dartmouth College.
Henderson completed his Dartmouth College football career with 67 games played, starting 53 of those. He tallied 53 career points on 20 goals and 13 assists and scored eight game-winners. Henderson earned All-Ivy and All-Northeast second team honors his senior year despite an injury that held him to just 11 games played that fall. After being named the unanimous Ivy Player of the Year and an All-America selection in 2008, Henderson was cut down just nine games into this season. As a senior, he posted 12 points on four goals and four assists.
Move to Sweden.
In August 2009, Henderson spent a week training with the Swedish top team Kalmar FF. Although he was not signed by Kalmar, he made a good impression and in an interview post Henderson's trial, a Kalmar FF spokesperson mentioned the possibility of signing Henderson in future.
Mjällby AIF.
In December 2009 Henderson signed a three-year contract with the Swedish 1st Division Club, Mjällby AIF, who were promoted from the Swedish 2nd Division at the conclusion of the preceding season. He began his appointment with the club in January 2010. Specific terms of the contract are undisclosed, but include a signing bonus, salary and other stipends.
On 26 February 2010, Henderson suffered a knee injury in pre-season training with Mjällby AIF which prevented him from making his All Whites debut against Mexico the following week. A scan later revealed a ruptured Anterior cruciate ligament which required surgery, keeping Henderson out of all football for six to eight months, ending his hopes of representing New Zealand at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. After several setbacks with his injury he finally got to make his league debut in August 2012 against IFK Göteborg.
International career.
Henderson has achieved national representation in all age-grade teams including the New Zealand national under-23 football team who participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He played in all of New Zealand's qualifying matches and in New Zealand's three group matches against China (1-1), Brazil (0-5) and Belgium (0-1).
Henderson also competed at the 2007 FIFA Under 20 World Cup with captain and fellow Dartmouth College teammate Dan Keat.
On 9 February 2010, Henderson was officially selected in a 17-strong New Zealand squad to face Mexico in an International friendly in Los Angeles on 3 March 2010, however, a knee injury sustained while training with his club side one week from the game ruled him out of the match.
Henderson received a further All Whites callup on 17 May 2011, as part of a 23-man squad to play friendlies against Mexico and Australia in June.
After returning from his long-term injury and getting plenty of playing time for his club team, Henderson finally made his debut for the senior New Zealand team on 15 October, 2013 in a friendly against Trinidad and Tobago.

Bernhard Kellermann

Bernhard Kellermann (March 4, 1879, Fürth, Kingdom of Bavaria – October 17, 1951) was a German author and poet.
Life.
Bernhard Kellermann enrolled in 1899 at Technical University Munich initially in general studies, but later focused on German literature and painting.
Beginning in 1904 he built a reputation as a novelist with early works such as "Yester and Li", and reached extraordinary success through 1939 with 183 printings.
The novel "Ingeborg" (1906) achieved an impressive 131 printings (until 1939).
In the years before World War I his novels were published following journeys in the United States and Japan.
His novel "Das Meer" ("The Sea") was made into film by Peter Paul Felner and Sofar-Film-Produktion GmbH, featuring prominent film stars.
His main work was "Der Tunnel" in 1913. It was highly successful for both him and his publisher, S. Fischer Verlag: circulation exceeded one million, and the work was translated into 25 languages.
Kellermann's works became more critical of society and directly related to real-world events; his previous writings were marked with impressionism and prose.
During World War I, Kellermann worked as a correspondent for the "Berliner Tageblatt" ["Berlin's Daily Journal"], one of Berlin's most influential newspapers, and published several war reports.
In 1920, his novel "Der 9. November" ("The Ninth of November") appeared, which argued critically against the behavior of soldiers and officers in relation to the people. This book doomed Kellermann during the Nazi era.
Beginning in 1922 he produced numerous novellas and short stories.
In 1926 Kellermann became a member of the Prussian poet academy, from which he was excluded 1933. In 1926 the divorced Lene Schneider-Kainer and Kellermann left Berlin on an extended odyssey of two years, often travelling by donkey or caravan, and visiting Russia, Persia, India, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Tibet, Hongkong and China.
His novel "The Ninth November" was banned and burned publicly.
Kellermann did not flee the country and offered no resistance, but wrote dime novels.

Glaciers of New Zealand

__NOTOC__
New Zealand contains many glaciers, mostly located near the Main Divide of the Southern Alps in the South Island. They are classed as mid-latitude mountain glaciers. There are eighteen small glaciers in the North Island on Mount Ruapehu. 
An inventory of South Island glaciers during the 1980s indicated there were about 3,155 glaciers with an area of at least one hectare (2.5 acres). Approximately one sixth of these glaciers covered more than 10 hectares. These include:
New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica, the Ross Dependency, also contains many glaciers.
List of glaciers.
Notable glaciers in New Zealand include:
Retreat of glaciers.
New Zealand glaciers have been retreating since 1890, with an acceleration of this retreat since 1920. Most of the glaciers have thinned measurably and have reduced in size, and the snow accumulation zones have risen in elevation during the 20th century. In the period 1971–75, Ivory Glacier receded from the glacial terminus, and about 26% of the surface area of the glacier was lost over the same period. Since 1980 numerous small glacial lakes were created behind the new terminal moraines of several of these glaciers. Glaciers such as Classen, Godley and Douglas now all have new glacial lakes below their terminal locations due to the glacial retreat over the past 20 years. Satellite imagery indicates that these lakes are continuing to expand. There has been significant and ongoing ice volume losses on the largest glaciers: the Tasman, Ivory, Classen, Mueller, Maud, Hooker, Grey, Godley, Ramsay, Murchison, Therma, Volta and Douglas Glaciers. The retreat of these glaciers has been marked by expanding proglacial lakes and terminus region thinning. The loss in volume from 1975–2005 is 11 percent of the total.
Several glaciers, notably the much-visited Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers on the West Coast, have periodically advanced, especially during the 1990s, but the scale of these advances is small when compared to 20th-century retreat. Both glaciers are currently more than shorter than a century ago. These large, rapidly flowing glaciers situated on steep slopes have been very reactive to small mass-balance changes. A few years of conditions favorable to glacier advance, such as more westerly winds and a resulting increase in snowfall, are rapidly echoed in a corresponding advance, followed by equally rapid retreat when those favorable conditions end. Hence glacier advance in a few locations is regarded as due to transient local weather conditions which brought more precipitation and cloudier, cooler summers since 2002.

Slovenian Railway Museum

The Slovenian Railway Museum, or Railway Museum of Slovenian railways (), in Ljubljana, Slovenia, is the national museum for Slovenia's railway history.
The museum is tasked with acquiring, preserving and supplying knowledge about Slovenian railway history on the basis of the national collection. It is owned by Holding Slovenske Zeleznice, and is located in front of the ex Ljubljana Šiška Railway station.
History.
The notion of documenting the history of Slovene railways was born in the 1960s when it was becoming clear that the era of the steam locomotive was drawing to a close. If this was late in the day, it was because a decision had been made after WW2 to make Belgrade the base for railway museum activities for the whole Yugoslavia, a choice that led later to the establishment of the Belgrade Railway Museum.
When the railwayman and woman of Slovenia elected to establish a museum of their own, they chose for its location the former locomotive shed at Ljubljana Siska. In its formative years, historic vehicles were temporarily displayed only in the 'roundhouse', a semicircular shed forming the centrepiece of the depot. This shed itself had been listed as part of the cultural heritage. 
In 1996, the year that marked the 150th anniversary of the advent of railways in Slovenia, the Museum of the Slovenian Railways presented to the public a permanent display of its most important railway artefacts. This was housed in the former railway training school in Kurilniška Street, close by the main site of the museum. The building, however, was old and in a ruinous state. With its demolition in 2002, the display had to be closed to the public for the duration.
It reopened on a newly acquired site next to the roundhouse in 2004. As before, the display introduces visitors to the main spheres of railway activity. Aided by its maps and illustrations, visitors can trace the whole development of Slovenia's railway network.
Communications.
Sound, sight and written communication systems played key roles in ensuring the safe operation of trains between stations. The newly invented electric telegraph was swiftly introduced to the railways. In 1876, the telephone was added. Later teleprinter took place of the telegraph. In 1963, the radio-telegraph as introduced to Slovenian railways as its operations centres were equipped with the required transmitters and receivers.
The need for accurate timing presented itself only with the beginning of the railways in order to respond to the demand for regular and punctual traffic.The clocks on the posts along the railway line were regulated each day at noon to the signal given by the telegraph. On stations there is a main clock which controls the rest of the clocks by means of electricity so they all show exactly the same time.
Rolling stock.
The most prominent element of the railway is its rolling stock, especially its locomotives. Steam locomotives, which made the development of railways possible, first appeared in the early years of the 19th century. They reigned supreme for more than 150 years. Throughout this time, they were continually developed and improved. The extensive museum collection includes more than sixty locomotives and fifty other vehicles. Only the most important are on display.
The oldest locomotive is the former Southern Railway No. 29.718, built in 1861. Keeping her close company is the diminutive No. 162-001. Her huge chimney earned her the nickname 'the Kamnic Cornet'. Next is the most eminent of the engines, express locomotive No. 03-002, designed in 1910 particularly for the Ljubljana-Trieste line. Nearby is mighty No. 06-018 of 1930, also designed especially for lines in Slovenia. The smallest of all is No. K3, a little gem built in 1892 especially for the narrow gauge Poljčane - Slovenske Konjice Line.
Signalling and Safety Equipment.
Signalling apparatus and all the safety equipment associated with it allows rail travel to be speedy and safe. It protects trains when they are stationary and in motion. It ensures that points and signals are correctly set for their passage.
Around 1900, electromechanical signalling and safety equipment was introduced. It has two essential controls. First is the lever frame at its base. This houses the levers used to change the positions of the points and signals. Second, and above the lever frame, are the indicator panels. These hold the electric block repeaters that maintain communication with the main control frame in the stationmaster's office, from which route orders for trains are despatched. The stationmaster's and the signalmen's apparatus is interlocked to ensure that mistakes cannot occur.
Station Master's Office.
The station master's office is a key part of the railway station. It is the place where the traffic officer, the station 'chief', sees that all that is required to ensure the safe and regular operation of the trains is carried out. Using his signalling equipment, the traffic officer transmits order to his more remote signalmen about how the points and signals are to be set. In the past, the connections to adjoining stations needed to operate the trains were by telegraph. With the passage of time, the telephone and other modern telecommunication devices were introduced to assist him. On top of all this, he also saw to the ticket sales.
Development, Construction and Maintenance.
The development of Slovenia's railway network is depicted with seven maps, each relating relating to a distinctive era. Historic boundary stones, engraved with the individual railway companies, bear witness in the display to each period. In their time,they marked the ownership of the land where the track was laid.
Railway vehicles characteristically operate on special tracks, known as the 'permanent way'. Such tracks make it possible, for some effort, to transport loads several times heavier than normal roads would allow. Over time, calls for ever-heavier vehicles and greater speed demanded the development of stronger track. This involved changes in the size of the rails and in the ways in with they were secured, and in the sleepers, where wood gave way in some places to steel and, finally, concrete.
The gangs that maintained the permanent way used a range of tool and vehicles. The small trolleys the employed to maintain the track and carry their equipment and material were allowed to travel on the ine only by special arrangement.
Uniforms.
Uniforms, 'garments of honour', were introduced in the early days of the railways so the railway employees could be distinguished from passengers. They differed from company to company. In Slovenia, until 1952, they also indicated employees' rank. Until 1927, on special occasions, higher-ranking officials wore full-dress uniforms.
Railwaymen were always provided with the smaller items of equipment needed for their work. There varied little over the years.

<doc id="18761837" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18761837" title="Mediology">
Mediology

Mediology (from the French word "médiologie"), broadly indicates a wide-ranging method for the analysis of cultural transmission in society and across societies, a method which challenges the conventional idea that 'technology is not culture'. The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action. 
The term was first coined and introduced in French as "médiologie" by the French intellectual Régis Debray in the "Teachers, Writers, Celebrities" section of his book "Le pouvoir intellectuel en France", (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's "Transmitting Culture" (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007.
The practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory.
Mediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as media sociology is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as semiotics does). It differs from the models put forwards by communication studies, in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of religions, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology... "would like to bring to light the function of medium in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media" [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314]
Mediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any milieu. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty linguistic or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which "material technologies and symbolic forms" [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314] combine to produce things such as rituals, architecture, flags, special sites, customs, typefaces and book bindings, smells and sounds, bodily gestures and postures, all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people.
Debray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non-media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the bicycle, which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early modernist art and cinema.
A mediologist might thus make an examination "within a system" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of "the interaction between systems" (e.g.: how painting and early photography influenced each other), or even of "the interactions across systems" (e.g.: the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, telegraph and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars).
Debray is generally critical of some of the ideas of Marshall McLuhan (whom he sees as being overly technologically determinist), and of the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. He also tries to step beyond Antonio Gramsci, in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article. The first, by the screenwriter Yvette Bíró ("Wide Angle" magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's "Vie et Mort de l'Image", in which she claimed to have discerned "traces of a strong, vulgar Marxist school of thought".
The second review, by Pramod Nayor of the University of Hyderabad ("Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory", Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of "Transmitting Culture" (2004). In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to Birmingham School cultural studies ranging from "Raymond Williams through Stuart Hall". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites Bruno Latour, Eugene Thacker and Dwight Atkinson - have also examined science in relation to "intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture"
An article by Steven Maris in "Fibreculture" No.12 similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in "the French academic scene" and that thus "Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal". Maris also notes that mediology "predates much of the [current academic interest in networked cultures and new media".
Physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont have criticized Debray's work for using Godel's theorem as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book "Fashionable Nonsense". Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled "À l'ombre des lumières : Débat entre un philosophe et un scientifique", which so far has not been translated into English.
Despite such criticisms, the six-volume "New Dictionary of the History of Ideas" (2004) wrote of Debray that "His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it." (Vol.4, page 1394).

St. Anthony's High School (Lahore)

St. Anthony's High School is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan It is situated at Lahore's historical road, The Mall.
The Marist Fathers of Ireland established St. Anthony's High School in 1892. It now has been expanded to college level as well. The Sacred Heart Cathedral is located besides the school.
When Lt. Col (ret) L. C. Rath was the principal in 1992, nearly 2,000 pupils were enrolled at the school with a staff of 100.
The motto of the institution is "Scientia cum Virtute" meaning ""Knowledge with Virtue"".
History.
The East India Company of England after waging wars against European intruders in India and local Rajas established its rule in the South Asia in 1849, when Punjab and NWFP fell to it under a proclamation of 30 March 1849. To run its administration smoothly it needed literate locals and so established educational institutions with English as the medium of instruction from where Indians were recruited for jobs. With the British occupation of India, the American and European missionaries started pouring into India to enlighten it with modern education.
St. Anthony's was founded on 1 March 1892 in Peeli Kothi, Empress Road, Lahore by the Marist Fathers of Ireland. They named it St. Anthony's Catholic Day School. Rt. Reverend Doctor Van Don Bouch performed its opening ceremony with three students at Empress Road Lahore where St. Anthony's Church and Don Bosco School stand today.
As it progressed, its site was shifted to 3-Lawrence Road, where it was renamed St. Anthony's High School in 1900 which was dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua who sympathised with the miserable and gave hope to the despaired people. The Bishop of Lahore Rt. Reverend Van Don Bouch performed the dedication ceremony. Father Leo took over as the first Principal of the school and started 'O' Level classes.
On 27 January 1896, the Indian Railways gave a grant of Rs.500 for the construction of the school and thus the institution was called Railway Church School. The Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne sanctioned Rs.5000 for the school building. A boarding house was constructed for the students in 1896.
Lawrence Road Campus.
This is the biggest campus. The campus has four buildings consisting of classrooms, a laboratory, a library and offices. There is a basketball court and a large playground. A canteen is provided for the students in the main ground. The school was one of several buildings damaged or destroyed by a bomb blast in Lahore in May 2009.
Curriculum.
It offers courses leading to the Cambridge O/A levels and Matriculation. During the academic year, the school has four sets of monthly tests and two long examinations.
Scholastic achievements.
During Lt. Col. L.C. Rath's principalship, the school won the Educational Trophy from the Board of Secondary Education, Lahore for excellent Matriculation result. 
Extracurricular activities.
Co-curricular and extracurricular activities include debates, excursions, funfair, science model fair and annual sports. In 2006 a cricket under-13 team and an under-16 team formed part of a 47-member delegation including teachers from St Anthony's, travelled to Chandigar, India to play matches with the St John's Cricket Academy team. Mr Cecil Chaudhry was Principal of St Anthony's High School at the time. Students take part in debates and quiz programmes in countries, and in cities of Pakistan.

Septimius Antiochus (died after 273) was a Roman usurper in Syria during the 3rd century.
In 272 AD Emperor Aurelian had defeated the breakaway Kingdom of Palmyra; its king Vaballathus and his mother Zenobia were in Roman captivity. In 273 AD another rebellion against Roman rule broke out in Palmyra. The rebels first approached Aurelian's governor Marcellianus to become emperor, but he pretended to consider the offer as he sent a letter to Aurelian warning of the rebellion. While the rebels were waiting they decided to elevate Septimius Antiochus, the reputed son of Zenobia, to the purple. Receiving Marcellinus's letter, the Emperor reacted quickly, and in the spring of 273 the city was brought back under Roman rule. Aurelian punished the city heavily, but allegedly spared Antiochus.

List of Minnesota Twins managers

In its 108-year history, the Minnesota Twins baseball franchise of Major League Baseball's American League has employed 29 managers. The duties of the manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Eight of these team managers have been "player-managers", all during the era; specifically, they managed the team while still playing for it.
The Minnesota franchise began its life as the Washington Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 1901 to 1960. In the early twentieth century, the Senators were managed consecutively by three future members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, who led for the next two seasons (1933–1934). In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto, and played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis from 1982 to 2009. Under manager Ron Gardenhire, the team moved to Target Field beginning in the 2010 season.
Seven managers have taken the franchise to the postseason, with current manager Gardenhire leading them to five playoff appearances, the most in their franchise history. Two managers have won World Series championships with the franchise: Bucky Harris, in the 1924 World Series against the New York Giants; and Tom Kelly, in the 1987 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals and 1991 against the Atlanta Braves. Harris is also the longest-tenured manager in their franchise history, with 2,776 games of service in parts of 18 seasons between 1924 and 1954; he is followed by Kelly, who managed 2,386 games over 16 seasons from 1986 to 2001. The manager with the highest winning percentage in team history is Billy Martin, who managed the team in 1969 and achieved a record of 97–65 (.599). Conversely, the manager with the lowest winning percentage is Malachi Kittridge, whose winning percentage of .059 was achieved with a record of 1–16 in the first half of 1904. Kittridge's tenure is also the shortest in team history.

McDonald Hobley

McDonald Hobley, born Dennys Jack Valentine McDonald-Hobley, (9 June 1917, Stanley, Falkland Islands – 30 July 1987) was one of the first BBC Television continuity announcers, appearing from 1946 to 1956.
Childhood and early career.
Hobley (pronounced to rhyme with 'nobly') was the son of Charles McDonald Hobley, the naval chaplain at the cathedral in Stanley and his wife Gladys, née Blanchard. He was christened Dennys Jack Valentine McDonald-Hobley and attended Brighton College, a public school, from 1931–36. He began his acting career in repertory theatre, under the stage names Val Blanchard and Robert Blanchard, using his mother's maiden name, and toured before the Second World War in J. B. Priestley's "Time and the Conways".
War service.
During the Second World War he served with the Royal Artillery. He was involved in an ultimately abandoned plot to abduct Adolf Hitler and bring him to Britain. He also served in Ceylon with the British Forces Broadcasting Service.
Post-war.
After being demobbed, he was selected as an announcer for the post-war revival of BBC Television.
He was also one of the comperes on the BBC's "Come Dancing" programme and appeared on various other shows as himself. He headed the team of BBC TV's early continuity announcers, which included Peter Haigh and Sylvia Peters. Hobley was also a presenter of BBC TV's "For Deaf Children" from 1953 to 1955, and "It's A Knockout" in 1966. During that year, he also returned to radio, fronting the 'Coffee Break Show' on the pirate station Wonderful Radio London. He later re-appeared in November 1986 as an in-vision announcer on BBC2, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of BBC Television.
On radio he was chairman of "Does The Team Think?"
He left the BBC to join Granada Television in 1956 for its opening. Later Hobley appeared in London's West End in the farce "No Sex Please, We're British" and other drama and comedy roles in television. Just before his death, he returned to the Falklands for a Channel 4 broadcast about the then British South Atlantic Dependencies. In July 1987 he was rehearsing the world premiere of Anthony Marriott and Bob Grant's play ""Home is Where Your Clothes Are"" produced by David Tudor. He had extreme difficulty learning his lines, which was unusual, and David Tudor had to release him from his contract. A few days later he died of a brain tumour.
He famously once introduced the politician Sir Stafford Cripps as 'Sir Stifford "Crapps"'.

Frantic (video game)

Frantic is a Commodore VIC-20 space shoot-em-up video game published by Imagine Software in 1982. The game involves the player piloting a space ship whilst trying to keep an X and Y axis centered on the enemy, which enters the field of play at varying speeds and directions. Slower enemies appear horizontally and quicker enemies diagonally. The game's title alludes to the fact that the game is timed, as fuel levels deplete during play.Centering the X and Y axis to target enemies involves engaging thrusters which in turn burns fuel. The game can be played with either a joystick or keyboard.
The game was released in cassette form only and was initially priced at £5.50.
Other formats.
According to the World of Spectrum, "Frantic" was due for a Sinclair Spectrum 48K release, but this never happened.

<doc id="18762036" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18762036" title="Pool chlorine hypothesis">
Pool chlorine hypothesis

The pool chlorine hypothesis is the hypothesis that long-term attendance at indoor chlorinated swimming pools by children up to the age of about 6–7 years is a major factor in the rise of asthma in rich countries since the late twentieth century. A narrower version of the hypothesis, i.e. that asthma may be induced by chlorine related compounds from swimming pools, has been stated based on a small numbers of cases at least as early as 1995. An empirically motivated statement of the wider form of the hypothesis is first known to have been published on the basis of tests of the effects of nitrogen trichloride above chlorinated water on the lung as well as epidemiological evidence by a group of medical researchers led by Alfred Bernard of the Department of Public Health in the Catholic University of Louvain in Brussels, Belgium in 2003. In the epidemiological studies, the association between chlorinated swimming pools and asthma was found to be more significant than factors such as age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status, exposure to domestic animals and passive smoking (in a study in Brussels), and independent of altitude, climate, and GDP per capita (in a Europe-wide study of 21 countries).
Effects of nitrogen trichloride (trichloramine) on the human lung.
Nitrogen trichloride has been directly linked as a factor causing asthma in two lifeguards and a swimming teacher. A study of 624 swimming pool workers found a significant correlation between upper respiratory symptoms and their total exposure to nitrogen trichloride. The study also found an excess risk in the workers for the specific symptoms indicative of asthma. In a study by Alfred Bernard's group, two hours exposure to an average concentration of 0.490 mg/m3 of nitrogen trichloride above a swimming pool was found in both children and adults to significantly increase the levels of the alveolar surfactant associated proteins A and B, which indicate hyperpermeability of lung epithelium. In other words, exposure to nitrogen trichloride was found to weaken the protective nature of the surface of the lungs.
Epidemiological studies.
In a study of 341 schoolchildren, Bernard and his colleagues found that long-term attendance at indoor chlorinated swimming pools by the children up to the age of about 6–7 years was a strong predictor of airway inflammation (measured by exhaled nitric oxide) independently of other factors, while for those children susceptible to allergic problems, as defined by having a blood serum level of immunoglobulin E greater than 100 kIU/L, their total time spent at indoor chlorinated swimming pools was a strong predictor of the probability that they would have asthma.
Relations to demographic and environmental variables.
In the Bernard group's study of 226 children in Brussels and the Ardenne region in 2003, asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (a test related to potential breathing difficulties) were not found to have any statistically significant correlation with the demographic and environmental factors of age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status or exposure to pets or passive smoking alone. However, when the time spent at chlorinated swimming pools (modified for pool height as a statistical way to indicate likely concentrations of chlorine related gases) was adjusted for exposure to pets and passive smoking, the significance of the correlations with asthma increased further. The authors describe this saying that a "very strong argument in of causality [between pool attendance and asthma comes from the synergistic action of exposure to pets and smoking, two well documented risk factors for asthma, which together considerably increase the strength of the associations, to levels largely above those usually observed in asthma epidemiology."
In a later study by the Bernard group of 190,000 children in 21 countries in Europe, it was found that 13 to 14 year old children were 2% to 3.5% more likely to have or have had asthma for every additional indoor chlorinated pool per 100,000 inhabitants in their place of residence. Other atopic diseases such as hay fever or atopic dermatitis were found to be not associated with the presence of the pools. The association of asthma with the number of indoor chlorinated swimming pools per 100,000 inhabitants was found by the authors to be independent of altitude, climate, and GDP per capita.
Scientific debate on the epidemiological studies.
After the publication of Bernard's group's 2003 study, B. Armstrong and D. Strachan described the study as "generally well conducted", but stated that some aspects of the statistical analysis and interpretation were "misleading", to the extent that "the epidemiological association of asthma with swimming pool use not as strong as claimed by the authors". 
Following publication of Bernard's group's 2006 study, some concerns by P.A. Eggleston and a response by Bernard's group were published. For example, Eggleston argued that if "chlorinated compounds at indoor swimming pools could cause asthma", then "frequent and longer exposures at home" should be even stronger causes of asthma, in contradiction to the available evidence from a single group of children. Bernard's group's response was that while children at an indoor chlorinated pool "actively inhale chlorination products as gases, aerosols, or even water", they are not usually involved in household cleaning tasks, so they could benefit from the hygienic effects of the chlorine based cleaning products while avoiding any significant contact with the related gases. Members of Bernard's group's declared that they had no potentially conflicting financial interests, while Eggleston declared that he had received money from the United States based group called the Chlorine Chemistry Council. In a "Faculty Disclosure" statement in an asthma-related publication, it was declared that Eggleston is "a consultant for Chlorine Chemistry Council, Church and Dwight, Merck Sharp & Dohme, and Procter & Gamble, and is on the speakers' bureau for AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck."
Hypothesised mechanistic explanation.
Alfred Bernard and colleagues argue that what is common to the pool chlorine hypothesis and epidemiological studies associating chlorine based irritants to atopy could be that frequent, long-term disruption of the epithelium of the lung, which normally provides a protective barrier against various pathogens, could allow allergens to cross this barrier. This process would also cause certain proteins from the lung epithelium to have increased blood serum concentrations.
Relation to the hygiene hypothesis.
Independently of their own research results, Bernard and his colleagues have suggested that the hygiene hypothesis still lacks a close causal link with asthma, and that the hygiene hypothesis might be most relevant for a restricted number of types of infections, such as those due to parasites.

Idraparinux

Idraparinux sodium is an anticoagulant medication in development by Sanofi-Aventis.
It has a similar chemical structure and the same method of action as fondaparinux, but with an elimination half-life about five to six times longer (an increase from fondaparinux's 17 hours to approximately 80 hours), which means that the drug should only need to be injected once a week.
Sanofi discontinued the development of idraparinux sodium.
Negative clinical trial.
A phase III trial of idraparinux sodium for stroke prevention in patients with AF (AMADEUS) was halted prematurely due to excessive clinically relevant and intracranial bleeding. Bleedings were particularly increased in elderly patients and those with renal impairment. Sanofi discontinued the development of idraparinux sodium in favour of a biotinylated formulation of the drug called idrabiotaparinux sodium.
Method of action.
Idraparinux selectively blocks coagulation factor Xa.
See Heparin: Mechanism of anticoagulant action for a comparison of the mechanism of heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux and idraparinux.
Spin off: idrabiotaparinux sodium.
Idrabiotaparinux sodium is also administered once-weekly. It has the same pentasaccharidic structure as idraparinux sodium, but with biotin
attached, which allows its neutralisation with avidin, an egg-derived protein with low antigenicity.
Sanofi conducted three phase III trials of idrabiotaparinux sodium between 2006 and 2008 in approximately 13,550 patients. In one phase III trial, idrabiotaparinux sodium was non-inferior to warfarin in preventing the recurrent VTE at three months in patients with pulmonary embolism and the incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was lower in the idrabiotaparinux sodium arm. The drug was expected to be filed for stroke prevention in patients with AF in 2011. However, Sanofi has since discontinued its development. The company announced in May 2011 that the drug is available for licensing. A systematic review foud that until now there is not sufficient evidence to clarify whether idraparinux or idrabiotaparinux is as effective and safe as the standard warfarin treatment for venous thromboembolism prevention. idraparinux or idrabiotaparinux decreased major bleeding rate significantly but had a trend to increase the all cause mortality compared with warfarin.

The movie takes place after the Vietnam War in 1979 and revolves around Corporal Rudy Spruance (Jason Biggs), a soldier mistakenly sent to Qangattarsa, a U.S. Army Medical Corps base in the Arctic instead of his official base in Hawaii. He soon finds out that his records have accidentally been replaced by the records of Corporal Martin Pederson, who probably has been sent to Hawaii. While he is posted as the base's PIO (Public Information Officer), he finds out that underneath the base, there is a secret and classified hospital ward, where the near-insane commanding officer, Lt. Col. L. G. Woolwrap (Jeremy Northam), has been ordered to keep soldiers from a secret mission led by himself in the Vietnam War who have incurable wounds.

Caernarfon Mithraeum

The Caernarfon Mithraeum is a Roman Temple to the Roman god Mithras (or a mithraeum). The temple was located 137 meters north-east of the Roman castra of Segontium on the outskirts of modern Caernarfon in Gwynedd, Wales.
The remains were discovered by accident on 2 April 1958 and excavated by the National Museum of Wales in August of the following year under the direction of George Boon. The site was found to be already damaged by a sewer trench which cut across the anteroom and had removed part of the southeast corner, but the majority of the temple could be excavated. The excavators noted the site was quite marshy and this suggested that a stream had once flowed close to the temple at the bottom of the shallow valley. Unfortunately the marshy conditions caused the mechanical excavator to frequently fall into the excavation, causing further damage.
Mithraeum Phase I.
The first phase of the temple (and all subsequent temples on the site) was orientated on an alignment 30 degrees east of north at the foot of the western side of a small shallow valley. The building measured 14.6m by 6.55 and is tentatively dated to the third century AD, a period when the fort was occupied by the "Cohors I Sunicorum". The shrine consisted of an anteroom (narthex) at the southern end, followed by the temple proper which consisted of a sunken central nave flanked by low benches. This is typical of mithraic temples and enabled the temple to be clearly identified despite no sculptural or epigraphic evidence being found. A rectangular alcove stood at the northern end and would have held the tauroctony. Untrimmed beach boulders were used for the walls, which must have given the structure a rustic look. No trace of the bonding mortar for the stones survived. Several fragments of purple Cambrian slate tiles were found belonging to the roof.
The narthex, measuring 1.82m x 5.48m, was almost totally destroyed and no trace of any features survived, including the floor covering. The shrine measured 10.6m x 5.48m with a 2.43m wide niche at the northern end, 45 cm deep. The benches were 1.52m deep and 9.1 meters long. Steps must have led down into the nave, though this part was destroyed by the sewer trench. The bench tops were at ground level, the same level as the narthex. The only dating evidence came from a worn "denarius" coin of Faustina I (138-9 AD) found on top of one of the benches.
Mithraeum Phase II.
For the second phase, timber colonnades were inserted, presumably to help support the weight of the slate roof. The ten timber columns were supported by small stone bases, each base set on a bed of cobbles. The fact that each base is different (including one circular in shape while the rest are all square) suggested to the excavators that they were salvaged from various other buildings. A v-shaped tile-lined drain was cut into the floor and entered the temple through the exterior wall just north of the end of the south bench and ran diagonally across the nave to terminate at the front of the middle of the north bench. A tank must have existed here to collect the trickle of spring water.
No dating evidence existed for this phase, however the excavator surmised by the lack of wear on the Phase I floor that Phase II occurred very soon after.
Mithraeum Phase III.
The third and final phase of the temple was preceded by the partial collapse of the roof. Broken slates were used to raise the level of the nave, maybe helping to avoid the waterlogging that may have affected the earlier two phases. This layer was sealed by a new cobbled floor throughout the nave. To compensate for the raising of the nave height, the benches and the area in front of the niche were raised. Small flights of two steps were now erected at the front of the benches near the entrance into the nave and steps were provided to lead up to the area in front of the niche. A stone platform 0.9m x 1.52m was built to the right of the niche, possible to serve as a statue base. The colonnade from Phase II was removed and at least five small pedestals were placed against the bench fronts.
A layer of soil was found, no more than 60 mm thick, between the Phase III floor and layer of burnt debris that sealed the site. This indicated a period of abandonment prior to the burning of the roof and also explains why no mithraic sculptures were found in the building as they had all been removed. This would equate well with the removal of the garrison of Segontium in c290 AD.

Far East Broadcasting Company

Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC) is an international radio network that airs Christian programs in 149 languages. Broadcasts are aired from shortwave, mediumwave (AM), and FM transmitters located throughout the world. The organization also works to meet the physical needs of its listeners by providing scholarships, holding marriage seminars, and distributing items such as seedlings (helping a family grow their own food) and bicycles (transportation for students or pastorss).<br>Although many listeners live in very remote locations, FEBC receives more than 850,000 listener responses in the form of visits to the station, letters, text messages, phone calls and emails.
FEBC's Mission.
FEBC's Mission is to develop radio programming and deliver it to listeners in such a way that they move toward Jesus Christ and into His Kingdom, that they know Him as Saviour, Lord, and King, follow His teaching, and live in obedience to Him as His servants, and as members of a local body of believers.
History.
FEBC 's history dates back to the close of World War II, when countless soldiers were returning from the conflict in the Pacific, newly aware of the great spiritual needs of Asia.
John Broger and Bob Bowman were among those who felt called by God to set up a radio ministry in Asia even before the war. They envisioned a ministry that would bring the Gospel to millions of people in Asia. One country especially was in their hearts: China.
Incorporated in 1945, FEBC's very first broadcast was aired from a station in Shanghai. But this was short-lived. By early 1948 all mission work in China was winding down and an alternative site was sought.
John Broger searched Asia for a likely place to relocate FEBC's radio ministry and decided on the Philippines. Ideally located in the South China Sea, the Philippines had much to offer.
The Philippines at that time was newly independent from the USA and was more than willing for FEBC to establish its operations there. The first broadcast went on air in Manila on June 4, 1948 over local station KZAS (now known as DZAS).
International broadcasts to China started the following year and have since expanded to cover most of Southeast Asia, as well as Russia. FEBC’s sister company, Feba Radio, broadcast programs in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
FEBC currently operates a total of 41 AM and FM stations worldwide and also broadcast international programs in 149 languages via short wave radio from two major transmitter sites - several locations in the Philippines and one in Saipan ().
Statement of Faith.
FEBC is an extradenominational radio ministry enterprise for the sole purpose of taking the Good News to the world by radio. In so doing, it seeks to cooperate with and support existing missionary efforts and the ministry of the greater body of Christ worldwide.
FEBC believes that Gospel radio ministry should present a consistent message for the edification of others. Cooperation in such an enterprise as this may be achieved and maintained only by loyalty to a common and positive agreement in the broadcast message. In Christ we have fellowship with Evangelical denominations and missionary groups, and base our cooperation upon the following great truths of the Bible.

SS El Sol

SS "El Sol" was a cargo ship built in 1910 for the Morgan Line, a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Company. During World War I, she was known as USAT "El Sol" in service with the United States Army and as USS "El Sol" (ID-4505) in service with the United States Navy. At the end of war, she reverted to her original name of SS "El Sol".
SS "El Sol" was one of four sister ships that carried cargo and a limited number of passengers for the Morgan Line. She was acquired by the U.S. Army after the United States entered World War I in April 1917, and converted to carry horses and mules to France. In August 1918, the ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy and continued transporting animals through the end of the war.
"El Sol" returned to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until March 1927, when she sank in New York Harbor after colliding with "Sac City" of the American Diamond Line. A portion of the ship's cargo was salvaged but the ship was scrapped later in the year.
Early career.
SS "El Sol" was a cargo and passenger steamship launched on 11 May 1910 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. of Newport News, Virginia (yard no. 130), and delivered to the Atlantic division of the Morgan Line on 20 August 1910. She was the first of four sister ships; the other three being "El Mundo", , and . "El Sol" was , was long by abeam, and made . The vessel sailed for the Morgan Line, the brand name of the Southern Pacific Steamship Company (a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad), which employed her to carry cargo and a limited number of passengers between New York; New Orleans, the eastern terminus of the Southern Pacific line; and Galveston, Texas.
World War I.
After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, "El Sol" was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) on behalf of the United States Army, who designated her as an animal transport ship. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of "El Sol", for other ships this typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.
Sources do not reveal all of "El Sol"'s movements, but it is known that she departed on her second trip to France from Newport News on 10 February 1918. Carrying 650 animals, "El Sol" headed to New York to join in a convoy with fellow Army transport , and U.S. Navy troop transports , , , , , and . The convoy was escorted by when it departed from New York on 18 February, and arrived at Saint-Nazaire on 4 March. Ten animals on board "El Sol" died or were destroyed during the crossing.
The next recorded activity of "El Sol" was on 3 August, when she was transferred from the Army to the U.S. Navy and commissioned the same day with Lieutenant Commander G. Anderson, USNRF, in command. "El Sol" was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) and continued to carry animals and supplies for the U.S. Army.
By August, each animal transport ship had a transport veterinarian and a permanent veterinary detachment to care for the animals while on board the ship. "El Sol" had also been joined by two of her sister ships, and in animal transport duty. She next departed Newport News on 23 August 1918 with 520 horses and mules on board. Upon arrival at Saint-Nazaire on 19 September, "El Sol" delivered her complete load of animals; none had died during the passage. After returning to the U.S., "El Sol" departed again on 30 October with another 620 animals on board. Docking in Bordeaux on 13 November—two days after the Armistice—she again delivered her full load of animals. 
"El Sol" made two more roundtrips for the NOTS over the next five months. While returning to the United States from her last NOTS sailing in late March 1919, "El Sol" responded to distress calls from , a Navy troop transport which had a damaged rudder and was disabled. "El Sol" came to the aid of the stricken ship, which was east of New York, to attempt to take her under tow. During the day on 28 March, "Scranton" attempted to run a towline to "El Sol" by sending a launch in the rolling seas, but it capsized, killing three men. Ultimately, "El Sol" stood by "Scranton" for over 40 hours until minesweeper arrived and took "Scranton" under tow.
At the conclusion of her last NOTS voyage on 3 April, "El Sol" was converted to a troop transport and assigned to the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force on 15 April. "El Sol" returned 2,714 healthy and wounded American servicemen from France in two voyages. Decommissioned on 18 September, "El Sol" was returned to the Morgan Line soon after.
Postwar civilian service.
"El Sol" resumed cargo service with the Morgan Line, where she had 8 years of uneventful operation. On 11 March 1927, however, "El Sol" was inbound to New York with a $1,000,000 cargo of pig iron, copper, and bales of cotton. When a heavy fog settled over New York Harbor, Captain Charles H. Knowles ordered his ship to anchor until the fog cleared. As "El Sol" was being maneuvered into position at about 07:45, the American Diamond Line ship "Sac City" hit a glancing blow to "El Sol", bounced off and then struck "El Sol" a second time, ripping through "El Sol"'s plating. "Sac City"'s bow had some slight damage, but "El Sol" sank quickly in about of water about a half-mile (800 m) south of the Statue of Liberty. Out of "El Sol"'s crew of 45 men, 44 were rescued; the ship's carpenter, who could not swim, was last seen clutching the ship's rail as it went below the surface.
"El Sol" settled on the bottom at a 45° angle with only the tops of her masts protruding above the surface; the Morgan Line house flag—a blue house flag with a red "M" inside a white star—still fluttered in the breeze. Even though the sunken vessel was not considered a hazard to navigation, in another fog two days later a Staten Island Ferryboat nearly hit "El Sol"'s wreck.
In a hearings before the United States Steamboat Inspection Service, Captain Knowles of "El Sol" and the captain of "Sac City" were both cleared of wrongdoing in the collision, and the blame was laid on the heavy fog. On 31 July, "The New York Times" reported on the cargo salvage operations still underway on the wreck of "El Sol". In three months of continuous operations, the salvage company reported that about 35% of the sunken ship's cargo had been recovered. The hulk of "El Sol" was scrapped later in 1927.

Schaper Toys

Schaper Toys, or W.H. Schaper Mfg. Co., Inc. as it was originally known, was a game and toy company founded in 1949 by William Herbert Schaper in Minneapolis, Minnesota. "Herb" Schaper published a variety of games but was best known for having created the children's game, "Cootie". Through the 1970s and 1980s, the company operated as Schaper Toys, a subsidiary of Kusan Inc. In 1986, Schaper Toys was acquired by Tyco Toys. "Cootie" was the company's bestseller.
Company history.
William Herbert "Herb" Schaper was a Minnesota postman who created, developed, and manufactured a children's game known as "Cootie". After whittling a fishing lure in 1948, he molded the object in plastic, fashioned a game around it, and formed the H. W. Schaper Mfg. Co., Inc. to manufacture and publish the game. In the fall of 1949, the game was launched on the market, and sold through Dayton's department stores. Schaper sold 5,000 "Cootie" games by 1950, and over 1.2 million games by 1952. 
Schaper Toys manufactured a host other games including the well-known "Ants in the Pants" and "Don't Break the Ice". While most children's games of the period were made of paper and cardboard, Schaper Toys was one of the first toy and game manufacturers to extensively use plastic in its products. Schaper games were constructed almost completely of plastic. 
The company introduced Stompers, a battery-powered line of toy trucks and other vehicles in 1980. 
In the early 1980s Schaper became one of the licensed producers of Playmobil in the United States. A large deal with McDonald's to promote Playmobil by distributing figures in Happy Meals ended badly when the toys were found to violate American child safety regulations.
Schaper Manufacturing operated as the Schaper Toy division of Kusan Inc. in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1986, Schaper Toys was acquired by Tyco Toys, which is now a division of Mattel Inc. In the deal, Tyco sold the rights to four Schaper games including "Cootie" to Hasbro's Milton Bradley division. "Cootie" is manufactured and sold today through Milton Bradley with legs featuring in-line skates, sneakers, and other fanciful accessories.
Selection of games.
"Dunce".
"Dunce" (1955) is a game for two to four players. Its object is to avoid being the first player to complete a plastic figurine of a boy wearing a dunce cap. Components consist of a stool, a body, a head, a dunce cap and a die. The plastic parts are acquired at the roll of the die beginning with the stool and ending with the cap. The player who completes his figurine first is the loser.
"Li'l Stinker".
"Li'l Stinker" (1956) is a game for any number of players ages 4 to 8. The game is similar in concept and play to "Old Maid". Components consist of 41 plastic tiles depicting a variety of characters with one tile picturing a skunk. Tiles are paired and discarded until one player loses the game by holding the skunk.
"Puzzling Pyramid".
"Puzzling Pyramid" (1960) is a game for 2, 3 or 4 players of all ages. The object of the game is for each player to use a magnetic "exploring wand" to guide a steel ball up one of the four colored (yellow, red, green, blue) sides of a pyramid into a common "treasure vault" at the top. On the inside of each side of the pyramid, plastic "tunnel blocks" are placed by an opposing player before the start of the game, which are designed to impede the wand user's progress to the top, however at least one open path must be provided.
"Shake".
"Shake" (1950) is a game of chance for two to four players ages 8 to adult. The object of the games is to complete a row of six numbers in the same line; either straight across, up and down, or diagonal from corner to corner. Components consist of a plastic board, chips, and dice.
"Stadium Checkers".
"Stadium Checkers" is a race game for two to four players ages 8 to adult. The object of the game is to move one's five colored marbles from the outer rim of the 'stadium' to a slot in the center of the board. The game was introduced in 1952. In 2004, the game was republished as "Roller Bowl" by Winning Moves Games USA. Its original name was restored in 2007. 
"Tickle Bee".
"Tickle Bee" (1956) is a physical skill game for one player ages 3 and up. Components consist of a molded plastic maze covered with a clear plastic film, a metal "bee" confined within the maze, and a magnetic wand. The game is won when the bee is guided through the maze without touching the tip of the wand.

CAMM (missile family)

The CAMM (Common Anti-Air Modular Missile) series is a family of surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles developed by MBDA for the United Kingdom. The missile is based on the ASRAAM infra-red air-to-air missile, sharing some common features and components but with updated electronics and an active radar seeker. It is envisioned that the missile will be introduced into all three service branches of the British Armed Forces and is currently scheduled to enter service starting 2016. The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile is intended to replace the Sea Wolf missile on Type 23 frigates of the Royal Navy, the Rapier missile in British Army service and contribute to the eventual replacement of ASRAAM in service with the Royal Air Force.
Three variants of the missile have been designed for use across the Air, Maritime environments. These are designated as CAMM(A), CAMM(L) and CAMM(M) respectively. The maritime variant is known as Sea Ceptor in the Royal Navy.
History.
The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile has its roots in a Technology Demonstration Programme (TDP), jointly funded by MBDA and the Ministry of Defence as part of the United Kingdoms Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS). Phase 1 of the TDP worked on technologies for soft vertical launch, the low-cost active radar seeker, a dual-band two-way datalink and a programmable open systems architecture. Phase 2 began in 2008 and covered the manufacture of flight-worthy subsystems, mid-course guidance firings and captive airborne seeker trials on a Qinetiq Andover experemental aircraft. The Soft Vertical Launch was proven over a series of trials, culminating in a successful truck launch in May 2011. The MoD decision on the business case for the naval variant was scheduled for 2010. After publishing the Strategic Defence and Security Review in October 2010, the business case was approved in April 2011.
FLAADS is part of a wider UK 'Complex Weapons' programme to deliver a variety of UK industry based weapons. FLAADS is intended to deliver a common weapons platform (the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM)) to equip forces in the air, land a maritime environments. During the early stages of the FLAADS programme, requirements were identified for the new missile to meet the known and unknown air threats of not only the present, but those well in-to future too. Thought was particularly given to meeting a target set ""of complex airborne targets which are typified by high speed, rapid evasive manoeuvres, low signatures and advanced countermeasureFLAADS MBDA, June 2010</ref>
In January 2012 MBDA and the Ministry of Defence announced a contract worth £483 million to fully develop the maritime variant of CAMM known as Sea Ceptor for the Royal Navy.
Characteristics.
Design characteristics allow for low cost by modularity and aiming to minimise electromechanical complexity by implementing most functionality in software. Additionally, the command and control software reuses over 75% of that developed for the PAAMS system.
CAMM has a minimum operational range of less than 1 km and a maximum range greater than 25 km, providing a significant advantage compared to the 1–10 km for Sea Wolf and other systems it will replace. CAMM is in weight, in length, diameter and reaches generous supersonic speeds of Mach 3 (or 1,020 meters per second). CAMM is a ship point defence and local area defence missile designed to respond to the sophisticated missile attacks of the future and has the capability to defend against saturation attacks of supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, aircraft and other high performance targets. It does this via multiple channels of fire, providing 360 degree coverage and high degrees of manoeuvrability. MBDA also state CAMM has a ""high rate of fire against multiple simultaneous targets"", providing capabilities comparable (on some levels) to the shorter range Aster 15 missile. In flight, the missile can receive mid-course guidance via a datalink before the active homing radar seeker takes over for the final approach to target. This does away with the need for separate tracking radars, making CAMM compatible with any 2D or 3D surveillance radars and allows targets to be hit that are not in line-of-sight.
CAMM comes in its own launch canisters, or alternately can be quad-packed into the SYLVER and Mark 41 vertical launching systems found on many warships. Additionally, it can be fired from aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon. The land and naval versions have folding tailfins and both use a "soft vertical launch" system, whereby the missile is ejected from a tube by a piston. A short booster uses squib thrusters to point the missile at the target before the main motor fires. The lack of toxic fumes on launch makes launches safer for users, avoids corrosion of the launch platform and the lack of exhaust vents allows the launch cells to be much more compact.
MBDA claim that CAMM has a ""wide target set"", including the capability to engage small naval vessels, which would give the missile a limited surface-to-surface role.
Variants.
Air variant.
CAMM(A) is the air-launched variant of the missile. Since the CAMM airframe is based on that of ASRAAM, the current dogfighting missile of the RAF and other airforces, MBDA say that CAMM is "easily adapted" onto aircraft that now carry ASRAAM. There is no requirement to replace ASRAAM yet, but it is intended that CAMM will form the basis of the RAF's future short-range missile. The modularity of CAMM would lend itself to a family of missiles like the Vympel R-27/AA-10 "Alamo", which is carried in both radar-guided and infra-red versions by Russian planes.
Land variant.
CAMM(L) is the land-based variant and will replace the Rapier missile batteries of the British Army from 2020 or so. Four three-pack launchers are fitted to a self-contained "pallet" that can be fitted to a range of trucks. The launch vehicle will not have its own radar, instead taking targeting information over a secure datalink as part of an integrated air-defence network and using the active seeker head for terminal guidance.
Maritime variant.
CAMM(M), the maritime variant known as Sea Ceptor, will be the first variant in service, replacing the Sea Wolf missile system on the Type 23 frigates from 2016. Sea Ceptor can be packed much more tightly, with up to four missiles fitting into the space occupied by one Seawolf. It will also equip the Global Combat Ships expected to enter service around 2021, and be an available option on any export versions of the Global Combat Ship. MBDA is working with the MoD, BAE Systems and Qinetiq to integrate Sea Ceptor with the Type 23 combat system. This work is centred at the Type 23 shore integration facility at Portsdown, near Portsmouth.
In September 2013 the MOD agreed a £250 million contract with MBDA for Sea Ceptor.

Russo-Georgian war

The Russo-Georgian War (also known as the 2008 South Ossetia War, Five-Day War or August War) was an armed conflict in August 2008 between Georgia on one side, and Russia and the separatist South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the other.
The 1991–92 South Ossetia War between ethnic Georgians and Ossetians had left slightly more than a half of South Ossetia under "de facto" control of a Russian-backed, internationally unrecognised government. Most ethnic Georgian parts of South Ossetia remained under the control of Georgia (Akhalgori district, and most villages surrounding Tskhinvali), with Georgian, North Ossetian and Russian Joint peacekeeping force present in the territories. A similar situation existed in Abkhazia after the War in Abkhazia (1992–93). Increasing tensions escalated during the summer months of 2008. On 5 August, a Russian spokesman said Russia would defend Russian citizens in South Ossetia if they were attacked.
During the night of 7 to 8 August 2008, Georgia launched a large-scale military offensive against South Ossetia, in an attempt to reclaim the territory. Georgia claimed that it was responding to attacks on its peacekeepers and villages in South Ossetia, and that Russia was moving non-peacekeeping units into the country. The Georgian attack caused casualties among Russian peacekeepers, who resisted the assault along with Ossetian militia. Georgia successfully captured most of Tskhinvali within hours. Russia reacted by deploying units of the Russian 58th Army and Russian Airborne Troops into South Ossetia one day later, and launched airstrikes against Georgian forces in South Ossetia and military and logistical targets in Georgia proper. Russia claimed these actions were a necessary humanitarian intervention and peace enforcement.
Russian and Ossetian forces battled Georgian forces throughout South Ossetia for four days, the heaviest fighting taking place in Tskhinvali. On 9 August, Russian naval forces allegedly blockaded a part of the Georgian coast and landed marines on the Abkhaz coast. The Georgian Navy attempted to intervene, but was defeated in a naval skirmish. Russian and Abkhaz forces opened a second front by attacking the Kodori Gorge, held by Georgia. Georgian forces put up only minimal resistance, and Russian forces subsequently raided military bases in western Georgia. After five days of heavy fighting in South Ossetia, the Georgian forces retreated, enabling the Russians to enter uncontested Georgia and temporarily occupy the cities of Poti, Gori, Senaki, and Zugdidi.
Through mediation by the French presidency of the European Union, the parties reached a preliminary ceasefire agreement on 12 August, signed by Georgia on 15 August in Tbilisi and by Russia on 16 August in Moscow. Several weeks after signing the ceasefire agreement, Russia began pulling most of its troops out of uncontested Georgia. Russia established buffer zones around Abkhazia and South Ossetia and created checkpoints in Georgia's interior. These forces were eventually withdrawn from uncontested Georgia. However some Western officials insist the troops did not return to the line where they were stationed prior to the beginning of hostilities as described in the peace plan. Russian forces remain stationed in Abkhazia and South Ossetia under bilateral agreements with the corresponding governments.
A number of incidents occurred in both conflict zones in the months after the war ended.
Background.
Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, South Ossetia operated as the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast, an autonomous region within the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. A military conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia broke out in January 1991 when Georgia sent troops to subdue a South Ossetian separatist movement. The separatists were helped by former Soviet military units, who by now had come under Russian command. Estimates of deaths in this fighting exceed 2,000 people. During the war several atrocities occurred on both sides. Approximately 100,000 Ossetians fled Georgia and South Ossetia, while 23,000 Georgians left South Ossetia. The war resulted in South Ossetia, which had a Georgian ethnic minority of around 29% of the total population of 98,500 in 1989, breaking away from Georgia and gaining "de facto" independence. After the Sochi agreement in 1992, Tskhinvali was isolated from the Georgian territory around it and Russian, Georgian and South Ossetian peacekeepers were stationed in South Ossetia under the Joint Control Commission's (JCC) mandate of demilitarisation. The 1992 ceasefire also defined both a zone of conflict around the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali and a security corridor along the border of South Ossetian territories. This situation was mirrored in Abkhazia, an Autonomous Republic within Georgia in the USSR, where the Abkhazian minority seceded from Georgia in a war in the early 1990s. Similar to South Ossetia, most of Abkhazia was controlled by an unrecognised government, while Georgia controlled other parts. In May 2008, there were about 2,000 Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia, and about 1,000 Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia under the JCC's mandate.
The conflict remained frozen until 2003 when Mikheil Saakashvili came to power in Georgia's Rose Revolution, which ousted president Eduard Shevardnadze. In the years that followed, Saakashvili's government pushed a programme to strengthen failing state institutions, including security and military, created "passably democratic institutions" and implemented what many viewed as a pro-US foreign policy. One of Saakashvili's main goals was Georgian NATO membership, which Russia opposes. This has been one of the main stumbling blocks in Georgia-Russia relations. In 2007, Georgia spent 9.2% of GDP on its military and had the highest average growth rate of military spending in the world. However, earlier low spending meant that its total military spending as a proportion of GDP in the 10 years preceding the war remained below Russia’s. Restoring South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgian control has been seen as a top-priority goal of Saakashvili since he came to power. During Saakashvili's rule, according to Freedom House, Georgia made only temporary and slight improvements in democracy and freedom compared with the situation under Eduard Shevardnadze However, the same organisation ranked it consistently better than Russia on all counts.
Emboldened by the success in restoring control in Adjara in early 2004, the Georgian government launched a push to retake South Ossetia, sending 300 special task-force fighters into the territory. Georgia stated that the operation aimed to combat smuggling, but JCC participants branded the move as a breach of the Sochi agreement of 1992. Intense fighting took place between Georgian forces and South Ossetian militia between 8 and 19 August 2004. According to researcher Sergei Markedonov, the brief war in 2004 was a turning point for Russian policy in the region: Russia, which had previously aimed only to preserve the status-quo, now felt that the security of the whole Caucasus depended on the situation in South Ossetia, and took the side of South Ossetia. In 2006 Georgia sent police and security forces to the Kodori Gorge in eastern Abkhazia, when a local militia leader there had rebelled against the Georgian authorities. The presence of Georgian forces in the Kodori Gorge continued until the war in 2008.
Georgia accused Russia of the annexation of its internationally recognised territory and of installing a puppet government led by Eduard Kokoity and by several officials who had previously served in the Russian FSB and in the Army. From 2004 to 2008, Georgia has repeatedly proposed broad autonomy for Abkhazia and South Ossetia within the unified Georgian state, but the proposals have been rejected by the secessionist authorities, who demanded full independence for the territory. In 2006, the Georgian government set up what Russians said was a puppet government led by the former South Ossetian prime minister Dmitry Sanakoyev and granted to it a status of a provisional administration, alarming Tskhinvali and Moscow.
In what Sergei Markedonov has described as the culmination of Georgian "unfreezing" policy, the control of the Georgian peacekeeping battalion was transferred from the joint command of the peacekeeping forces to the Georgian Defence Ministry.
In 1989, Ossetians accounted for around 60 percent, Georgians 20 percent, Armenians 10 percent and Russians 5 percent of the population of South Ossetia. about 87.5% of the population of South Ossetia have acquired Russian citizenship, as a result of being Soviet Citizens (Russia extended citizenship to most USSR citizens, as it is internationally recognised as a successor state to the USSR). Additionally, 71% of all Ossetians were living in Russia, most of them just across the Roki Tunnel in North Ossetia, and had family members in South Ossetia. From the viewpoint of Russian constitutional law, the legal position of Russian passport holders in South Ossetia is the same as that of Russian citizens living in Russia. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated that he would "protect the life and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they are". According to an EU report, this position is inconsistent with international law, which considers the vast majority of purportedly naturalised persons as not Russian citizens. According to Reuters, prior to the war Russia was supplying two thirds of South Ossetia's annual budget, and Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom was building new gas pipelines and infrastructure worth hundreds of millions of dollars to supply South Ossetian cities with energy. Moreover, Russian officials already had "de facto" control over South Ossetia's institutions, including security institutions and security forces, and South Ossetia's "de facto" government was largely staffed with Russian representatives and South Ossetians with Russian passports who had previously worked in equivalent government positions in Russia. In mid-April, 2008, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Russian PM Vladimir Putin had given instructions to the federal government whereby Russia would pursue economic, diplomatic, and administrative relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia as with the subjects of Russia. When President Saakashvili was re-elected in early 2008, he promised to bring the breakaway regions back under Georgian control.
Although Georgia has no significant oil or gas reserves of its own, its territory hosts part of the important Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline transit route that supplies western and central Europe. The pipeline, supplied by oil from Azerbaijan's Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli oil field transports of oil per day. It has been a key factor for the United States' support for Georgia, allowing the West to reduce its reliance on Middle Eastern oil while bypassing Russia and Iran.
Georgia maintained a close relationship with the G.W. Bush administration of the United States of America. In 2002, the USA started the Georgia Train and Equip Program to arm and train the Georgian military, and, in 2005, a Georgia Sustainment and Stability Operations Program to broaden capabilities of the Georgian armed forces. These programmes involved training by the United States Army Special Forces, United States Marine Corps, and military advisors personnel.
Prelude.
Military buildup.
During 2008, both Georgia and Russia accused each other of preparing for war. In April 2008, Russia said that Georgia was massing 1,500 soldiers and police in the upper Kodori Gorge area and planning to invade the breakaway region of Abkhazia. Russia said it was boosting its forces there and in the South Ossetia region as a response. Later, UNOMIG denied any build up in the Kodori Gorge or near the Abkhazian border by either sides.
In the same month Russia increased the number of its military peacekeepers in Abkhazia to 2,542 by deploying hundreds of paratroopers into the region. Even after the increase, troop levels still remained within the 3,000 limit imposed by a 1994 decision of Commonwealth of Independent States heads of state. Sergey Lavrov said that his country was not preparing for war but would retaliate against any attack. According to the 2012 statement by Vladimir Putin, Russia had been training the South Ossetian militias as part of the General Staff's 2006–2007 plan to rebuff Georgia in case of war.
On 16 April Russia's president Vladimir Putin signed a decree authorising direct official relations between Russian government bodies and the secessionist authorities in Georgia's Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The move further heightened tensions between Russia and Georgia.
On 20 April, a Russian jet shot down a Georgian reconnaissance drone flying over Abkhazia.
After the incident Saakashvili deployed 12,000 Georgian troops to Senaki. Georgian interior ministry officials showed the BBC video footage, which Georgia said showed Russian troops deploying heavy military hardware in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. According to Georgia, "it proved the Russians were a fighting force, not just peacekeepers". Russia strongly denied the accusations. Both countries also accused each other of flying jets over South Ossetia, violating the ceasefire.
From July to early August, Georgia and Russia conducted two parallel military exercises, the joint US-Georgian Immediate Response 2008 and the Russian Caucasus Frontier 2008. According to a paper published by Institute for Security and Development Policy shortly after the war, the Russian troops remained by the Georgian border instead of returning to their bases after the end of their exercise on 2 August. After the war, Major General Vyacheslav Borisov and commander of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division praised the exercises in the region as one of the reasons why his unit performed well in the war. The Georgian 4th Brigade, which later spearheaded the attack into Tskhinvali, took part in the Georgian exercise along with 1,000 American troops. This caused Russia to accuse the United States of helping Georgian attack preparations. After the exercise, the Georgian Artillery Brigade, normally based in two locations, in Senaki and in Gori, was now moved completely to Gori, from the South Ossetian border. According to Colonel Wolfgang Richter, a leading military adviser to the German OSCE mission, Georgia concentrated troops along the South Ossetian border in July.
On 5 August, Russian ambassador-at-large Yuri Popov reiterated the Russian position that his country would intervene in the event of military conflict. The Ambassador of South Ossetia to Moscow, Dmitry Medoyev, declared that volunteers were already arriving, primarily from North Ossetia, in the region of South Ossetia to offer help in the event of Georgian aggression.
According to "Moscow Defense Brief", an English-language defence magazine published by the Russian non-governmental organization, Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the Georgians "appear to have secretly concentrated a significant number of troops and equipment to the South Ossetian border in early August, under the cover of providing support for the exchange of fire with South Ossetian formations". The Georgian forces included the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades, the Artillery Brigade, elements of the 1st Infantry Brigade, and the separate Gori Tank Battalion, plus special forces and Ministry of the Internal Affairs troops  — as many as 16,000 men, according to the publication. International Institute for Strategic Studies and Western intelligence experts give a lower estimate, saying that the Georgians had amassed about 12,000 troops and 75 tanks on the South Ossetian border by 7 August. On the opposite side, there were said to be 1,000 Russian peacekeepers and 500 South Ossetian fighters defending Tskhinvali, according to an estimate quoted by "Der Spiegel".
Georgian military plan.
According to the study conducted by Moscow-based Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the Georgian government drew up a military plan to "conquer" South Ossetia. The Georgians hoped that their army, vastly superior to Ossetian forces, would take over South Ossetia within three or four days. Under the plan, Georgian forces with artillery support would advance rapidly into South Ossetia; one infantry brigade would take the village of Khetagurovo, west of Tskhinvali, while another would take the key Prisi Heights and the villages of Dmenis and Sarabuk, to the east of the city. The two brigades would then go around the Tskhinvali and link up at a village north of it, effectively encircling the city. They would then advance towards the village of Java and the Roki Tunnel to block Russian reinforcements. At the same time, Georgian commandos from the Interior Ministry and army special forces supported by artillery would take Tskhinvali. Battalion-sized groups would take over the Leningor and Znaur districts and the village of Kvaysa. After South Ossetia had been entirely overrun, a Georgian-backed government, the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia, would be installed under the leadership of Dmitry Sanakoyev. Subsequently, some 40,000 Georgian reservists, whose training was due to be completed by the time the war began, would maintain Georgian "occupation" of the territory and conduct counterinsurgency operations against any remaining pockets of resistance.
The Georgian plan completely overlooked the possibility of Russian intervention, with no apparent preparations for clashes with Russian troops, and no reasonable precautions were taken to provide air defense cover for Georgian troops in the event of Russian air attacks. Georgian soldiers were not informed that a clash with Russian troops was a possibility. It has been speculated that the Georgian government was planning to prevent or delay Russian involvement by offering safety guarantees for Russian peacekeepers, with the hope that Russia would try diplomacy first. Once that failed, it would take several days for Russian troops to be deployed, by which time the Georgians would have already overrun South Ossetia and captured the Roki Tunnel, through which Russian forces would have to advance to enter South Ossetia.
Russia was aware of this plan, and a decision was made to intervene in the event that it was carried out. After the Caucasus Frontier 2008 military exercise, two reinforced motorized rifle battalions were stationed permanently near the border with South Ossetia. Their goal was to enter South Ossetia within hours of any Georgian offensive and join Russian peacekeepers and Ossetian forces in fighting the Georgian offensive. The Russian Air Force would provide support from nearby airbases. Their goal would be to delay the Georgian offensive and prevent the Georgians from advancing deep into South Ossetia until reinforcements from Russia arrived. The nearest Russian units on permanent combat readiness would take an estimated 24–48 hours to arrive. If necessary, Russia would deploy mobile airborne units. Troops would also be deployed in Abkhazia in the event that the conflict reached that territory.
Pre-war clashes.
On 14 June into the early morning of 15 June, clashes erupted in South Ossetia. South Ossetian authorities reported that Georgian forces started shelling Tskhinvali with mortars from Georgian villages, and that Georgians fired on South Ossetian militia on the outskirts of Tskhinvali. Georgia claimed that it was responding to Ossetian shelling of the Georgian villages of Ergneti, Nikozi, and Prisi. Two people (one Ossetian and one Georgian) were killed, and four were injured in the clashes. Several houses in the Georgian villages shelled were also reportedly damaged. A fourteen-year-old boy was also injured by a land mine close to Ergneti, and subsequently died of his injuries. In early July 2008, violence again erupted throughout South Ossetia. On 3 July Ossetian militia attacked a convoy in an attempt to assassinate Dmitry Sanakoyev, chairman of the Georgian-backed Ossetian government (the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia). The attack failed to kill Sanakoyev, but injured three of his bodyguards. A South Ossetian police official was killed by a bomb attack on that same day. On 9 July four Russian Air Force jets performed a mission over South Ossetia to dissuade the Georgian Air Force from continuing UAV patrols in Ossetian airspace. Throughout July, a series of bomb blasts also targeted Georgian police patrols, the most serious being a 31 July bomb attack against a Georgian police SUV, which was blown up by an IED, injuring five policemen. Ossetian militia repeatedly fired on Georgian villages in South Ossetia, forcing Georgian police to return fire. 
Shelling by Ossetian separatists against Georgian villages began as early as August 1, drawing a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers and other fighters already in the region. In response to the attack, snipers from the Georgian Interior Ministry's special task force fired at border checkpoints of the South Ossetian Interior Ministry, killing four Ossetians and injuring seven, most of them South Ossetian Interior Ministry servicemen. On the night of August 1–2, heavy exchanges of fire took place, which involved the use of grenade launches and mortars. An Ossetian and a Russian peacekeeper from North Ossetia were killed. The number of Ossetian injured reached 15. Six Georgian civilians and one policeman were injured. Each side accused the other of firing first. During the week, the fighting intensified.
On 3 August, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned that an extensive military conflict was about to erupt. According to a Der Spiegel article, officials in European governments and intelligence agencies assumed that the warning concerned Saakashvili's plans for an invasion of South Ossetia, plans which had been completed earlier. Three days later, the evacuation of Ossetian women and children to Russia was completed, as some 35,000 people were successfully evacuated. On 4 August, the South Ossetian media reported that around 300 volunteers had already arrived from North Ossetia to help fight the Georgians and hundreds more were ready to join them from North Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.
Starting with the night of 6–7 August there were continuous exchanges of artillery fire between both sides. On 6 August Georgia reported that Ossetian militia had destroyed a Georgian Army APC in Avnevi, wounding three Georgian peacekeepers.
Clashes continued on 7 August, with South Ossetian forces based at the village of Khetagurovo exchanging fire with Georgian forces based at Avnevi and Nuli. At 2 p.m. on 7 August the Georgian peacekeeping checkpoint in Avnevi was reportedly shelled, killing two Georgian peacekeepers. Georgia began mobilizing for an offensive against South Ossetia. At around 2:30 p.m. Georgian tanks, 122mm howitzers, and 203mm self-propelled artillery guns began heading towards the administrative border of South Ossetia. In the late afternoon OSCE monitors confirmed the move of Georgian artillery and Grad rocket launchers massing on roads north of Gori. At 2:42 p.m. Georgia withdrew its personnel from the JPKF Headquarters in Tskhinvali. Georgian peacekeepers also began abandoning joint checkpoints. At 3:45 PM, Georgian forces opened fire at targets in Khetagurovo and the southern outskirts of Tskhinvali, employing self-propelled artillery guns and tanks. South Ossetian forces at Khetagurovo were suppressed. This use of heavy weaponry by the Georgians caused Russian forces based near South Ossetia to be put on high alert.
At 4 p.m. Temur Yakobashvili, the Georgian Minister of Reintegration, arrived in Tskhinvali for a previously agreed meeting with South Ossetians in the presence of chief Russian negotiator over South Ossetia, Yuri Popov. The Ossetians did not show up — a day before, the South Ossetian side refused to participate in bilateral talks, demanding a JCC session (consisting of Georgia, Russia, North and South Ossetia) instead, but Tbilisi had withdrawn from the JCC in March, demanding the format include also the European Union, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia. Yakobashvili confirmed that Tskhinvali was already largely evacuated: "Nobody was in the streets — no cars, no people". He met with the Russian commander of the Joint Peacekeeping Force (JPKF), General Marat Kulakhmetov, who stated that the Russian peacekeepers cannot stop Ossetian attacks and advised the Georgians to declare a ceasefire.
At about 7 p.m., President Saakashvili ordered a unilateral ceasefire, advised earlier that day by Kulakhmetov. The ceasefire held for a few hours and was also observed by the South Ossetian side, until firing was reportedly resumed again at around 10 p.m. Georgian armor continued to move to the South Ossetian line even during Saakashvili's ceasefire, and the Russian and Ossetian governments claimed that the ceasefire was just an attempt to buy time while Georgian forces positioned themselves for a major offensive. According to the Jamestown Foundation, attacks on Georgian villages intensified following Saakashvili's address. Avnevi was almost completely destroyed, Tamarasheni and Prisi were shelled, and a police station in Kurta (seat of the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia) was destroyed by shelling. Civilian refugees began fleeing the villages. The Georgian Interior Ministry reported that ten Georgian soldiers had been killed in clashes throughout August 7.
During a news broadcast that began at 11 p.m., Saakashvili announced that ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia were being shelled. Georgia announced that it was launching an operation to "restore constitutional order" as a response to the shelling. An OSCE monitoring group in Tskhinvali did not record outgoing artillery fire from the South Ossetian side in the hours before the start of Georgian bombardment. Two British OSCE observers reported hearing only occasional small-arms fire, but no shelling. According to Der Spiegel, NATO officials attested that minor skirmishes had taken place, but nothing that amounted to a provocation.
According to Georgian intelligence and several Russian sources, parts of 58th Russian Army moved to South Ossetian territory through the Roki Tunnel before the Georgian attack.
In his interview to the CNN, answering to the anchor's question, "Did you take a gamble? Your government launched its own attempt to retake South Ossetia, guess 24 hour ago?" Saakashvili answered "We did not. when Russian APCs crossed the border at 24 AM, August 7 we had to fire back the artillery, we had to take measures. Because it was a clear-cut case of intervention."
However, no conclusive evidence was presented by Georgia or its Western supporters that Russia was invading the country before the Georgian attack, according to the New York Times. Instead, "the accounts suggest that Georgia's inexperienced military attacked the isolated separatist capital of Tskhinvali on 7 August with indiscriminate artillery and rocket fire, exposing civilians, Russian peacekeepers and unarmed monitors to harm". Georgia's claim to be responding to a premeditated Russian assault received little support from the US and NATO.
Active stage.
Evening of 7 August.
At 11:45 p.m. Georgian forces began a major artillery bombardment of South Ossetia. Downtown Tskhinvali, surrounding heights and a number of villages were heavily shelled. Several other villages were more lightly shelled. The Georgians used about a hundred artillery guns and mortars, and 27 rocket launchers, including BM-21 Grad and LAR-160 units. During this bombardment, Georgian forces employed 152mm self-propelled guns and cluster bombs. At this point OSCE monitors reported that shells were falling on Tskhinvali every 15–20 seconds.
Human Rights Watch reports that the Georgian forces used Grad rockets, self-propelled artillery, mortars, and Howitzer cannons during the attack. The Georgians claimed that they were targeting Ossetian militia positions: according to witnesses' accounts, South Ossetian forces were stationed in the city of Tskhinvali and in neighboring villages. In Tskhinvali, they set up headquarters and defensive positions, including positions in the South Ossetian parliament building, several schools and nurseries. Georgian artillery-fire targeted and hit these buildings. In the numerous villages which were shelled, positions of Ossetian militia were in close proximity to civilian houses. Georgia claimed that the BM-21 Grad rockets employed were used solely to shell South Ossetian artillery positions, however, HRW documented a serious BM-21 rocket damage to a hospital building, houses and other civilian infrastructure in Tskhinvali. HRW concluded that while South Ossetian forces were responsible for endangering civilians by setting up defensive positions in close vicinity of civilian structures, Georgia was responsible for the use of indiscriminate weapons such as Grad MRL in densely populated areas, making the attack "unlawful".
Battle of Tskhinvali.
Early in the morning of 8 August Georgia launched a military offensive, codenamed Operation Clear Field to capture Tskhinvali. According to the EU fact-finding mission, 10,000–11,000 soldiers took part in the general Georgian offensive in South Ossetia. The Georgian 4th Brigade from Vaziani spearheaded the infantry attack, while the 2nd and 3rd Brigades attacked important heights, from which they were to move forward and seize the Didi Gupta bridge and numerous roads leading from the Roki Tunnel, in order to block a Russian counterattack. The 2nd and 3rd Brigades seized several strategic South Ossetian villages located on higher ground around the city.
The Georgian ground offensive began with an attack east of Tskhinvali by two battalions of the 4th Brigade, taking the village of Muguti without a fight and then seizing the village of Khetagurovo after a battle with an inferior South Ossetian force. Another battalion took the Znaur District to the west of the city without encountering resistance, while the Leninogorsk District was occupied without a fight by squads of Georgian Interior Ministry commandos.
At 2:00 AM, the Russian Army intervened, when reinforced battalions from the 693rd and 135th Motorized Rifle Regiments began arriving in South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel. They began securing positions on the road from the Roki Tunnel to Tskhinvali, so as to ensure the safe entry of additional Russian forces into the region.
After several hours of bombardment, and after key heights around Tskhinvali were secured, Georgian forces began to advance towards the city. South Ossetian forces employed artillery, mortars, and rocket launchers against Georgian forces massed in the village of Zemo-Nikosi, but the bombardment was largely ineffective. South Ossetian sources claimed that a Georgian tank attack on the suburbs of the city was repelled by South Ossetian militia at 3:46 AM. At 4:00 AM, Georgian forces approaching Tskhinvali began engaging South Ossetian forces and militia, with Georgian tanks shelling South Ossetian positions from a safe distance. Georgian troops also attempted to take the village of Kvaysa, west of Tskhinvali, but were repelled by a platoon of South Ossetian troops manning fortified positions, losing several wounded. At 6:00 AM, the Georgian 3rd Brigade launched an offensive into the Eredvi region, east of Tskhinvali, seizing villages and strategic vantage points. They soon encountered resistance from a company-sized South Ossetian force, firing from the Prisi Heights.
At the same time, Georgian Interior Ministry commandos, supported by Sukhoi Su-25 strike aircraft, artillery, tanks, and Otokar Cobra armored vehicles, entered the city. According to Ossetian sources, Georgian Su-25 planes bombed the village of Kvernet. Ossetian forces claimed to have downed one Georgian Su-25 early on 8 August. The Russian peacekeepers' southern compound, manned by about 250 soldiers, lay in immediate vicinity of the entrance to the city. After Georgian troops approached the compound, an exchange of fire with Russian peacekeepers broke out. The Georgian Otokar Cobra vehicles opened fire at the base with heavy machine guns, and the Russians positioned three BMP-1 armored vehicles at the perimeter of the base. The Georgians then called in tank support, and three T-72s from the Independent Combined Tank Battalion soon arrived. At 6:30, the tanks opened fire. The first shell destroyed an observation post on the roof of the compound, killing a Russian peacekeeper and a South Ossetian observer. The tanks also shelled the three Russian BMP-1 vehicles stationed in front of the base, killing five of their crews. During the engagement, one of the Georgian tanks, which became trapped in an irrigation ditch near the compound, was damaged by an RPG-7 rocket, and abandoned by its crew. The other two tanks pulled back and continued shelling the compound from a distance, and were soon joined by artillery and mortars. According to Russian sources, Georgian troops had captured the Southern Base of the Russian peacekeepers by 11:00 a.m. Georgian forces then sent in armored units to smash resistance offered by Russian peacekeepers and Ossetian militia. Russian peacekeepers repelled five Georgian assaults. According to Georgia, Georgian forces attacked Russian peacekeepers in self-defense after coming under fire from their bases.
A total of 10 Russian peacekeepers were killed. The peacekeepers' cafeteria was completely destroyed, and all of their buildings went up in flames.
Georgian shelling left parts of the capital city in ruins. The shelling of the city was extensively covered by Russian media prior to the military counteroffensive that followed. Russia claimed to have responded to an attack on the peacekeepers base and in defense of South Ossetian civilians against what they called "a genocide by Georgian forces".
South Ossetian and Russian authorities claimed that the civilian casualties in Tskhinvali may amount up to 2,000. These high casualty figures were later revised down to 162 casualties.
By 8 am. on 8 August, Georgian infantry and tanks had entered Tskhinvali and engaged in a fierce battle with Ossetian militia and the Russian peacekeeping battalion stationed in the city. Georgian forces entered particular parts of the city, located Ossetian positions, and then pulled back and called in artillery and airstrikes on identified enemy positions. Georgian snipers fired on Ossetian militia in support, and according to Ossetian sources, indiscriminately shot civilians, including people outside the city hospital. Georgian troops burned down the South Ossetian Presidential Palace, Ministry of Culture, and Parliament. A number of apartment blocks were set ablaze, and the streets were pocketed with numerous bomb craters. A Guardian reporter claimed that while some neighborhoods were intact, "there were patches of terrible destruction".
Russian artillery took positions in the north of the city and opened fire on Georgian forces, and the Russian Air Force began flying sorties against Georgian targets early on 8 August, utilizing Su-24, Su-25, Su-27, and Tu-22M aircraft, hitting Georgian armored columns and artillery positions. Georgian forces abandoned two T-72 tanks, along with some armored vehicles and pieces of equipment after a Russian Su-25 airstrike killed 20 soldiers and wounded more. During the early stages of the battle, three Russian Sukhoi Su-25 planes were shot down by Georgian anti-aircraft fire. A Russian Tupolev Tu-22M was also shot down by Georgian air defenses. Three of its crew members were killed, and another was taken prisoner. According to some reports, two other Russian jets were shot down by friendly fire. According to Georgian officials, 1,500 Georgian ground troops had reached the centre of Tskhinvali by 10 a.m. on 8 August, but were pushed back three hours later by Russian artillery and air attacks. By the afternoon, the Georgians had captured most of Tskhinvali, but were unable to take the northern quarters, where they were meeting heavy resistance from Ossetian militia and Russian troops, including regular Russian forces arriving from the Roki Tunnel. The Georgian 2nd and 3rd Brigades also ran into resistance, and were unable to take the Didi Gupta Bridge and the main routes leading to the Roki Tunnel. A Georgian air attack against the Didi Gupta bridge also failed to destroy it.
The BBC reported that Georgia may have committed war crimes during its attack on Tskhinvali, including possible deliberate targeting of civilians. Human Rights Watch found some evidence of firing being directed into basements, locations which civilians frequently choose as a place of shelter.
Ossetian militia and armed civilian volunteers engaged the Georgians in heavy street fighting, mainly utilizing ambushes. South Ossetian reinforcements passed from Dzhava on the Zara highway and entered Tskhinvali, carrying with them anti-tank weapons which proved successful in fighting Georgian armor. Three Georgian T-72 tanks were destroyed in the city centre of Tskhinvali by Ossetian forces utilizing RPG-7 anti-tank rockets. Two other Georgian tanks were abandoned on the Zars road, and were subsequently detonated by Russian troops. Ossetian military and civilian casualties mounted, and the operating room at Tskhinvali hospital was relocated to the basement. According to the hospital's head surgeon, about 700 operations were performed by candlelight. As blood supplies were low, many doctors donated their own blood before performing surgery. Priority was given to treating lightly injured Ossetian militiamen, so that they could rejoin the street fighting, only a few blocks away. The hospital itself was repeatedly hit by shelling, and 25 of the staff were killed or wounded.
According to Georgia, Russian military aircraft violated Georgian airspace around 10 a.m. on 8 August. Starting around 2 p.m., international press agencies began running reports of Russian tanks in the Roki Tunnel. According to a senior Russian official, the first Russian combat unit, the First Battalion of the 135th Motorized Rifle Regiment, was ordered at around dawn of 8 August to move through the Roki Tunnel and reinforce the Russian peacekeeping forces in Tskhinvali. According to him, the unit passed through the tunnel at 2:30 p.m. It reached Tskhinvali in the evening, meeting heavy resistance from Georgian troops. Georgia disputed the account, saying that it was in heavy combat with Russian forces near the tunnel long before dawn of 8 August. Some Western intelligence experts believe that Russian troops did not begin marching through the tunnel until roughly 11 a.m. on 8 August. By the afternoon of 8 August, Georgian forces had captured large parts of Tskhinvali, but had been unable to take the Northern quarter and the city centre. However, the Georgians were meeting heavy resistance from Ossetian militia and Russian reinforcements coming in from the Roki Tunnel. Georgian flank operations were unsuccessful in their goal of blocking the Gupta Bridge and the main routes leading to Tskhinvali from the Roki Tunnel and Java base. The Georgians became bogged down and their advance was stopped. Ossetian militia using handheld anti-tank weaponry proved effective against Georgian armor, knocking out a number of Georgian tanks, which eventually stopped disorganized and un-coordinated attacks. Isolated from the main Georgian forces, the Georgian Army's battalion-strong Kchevi Tank Group attacked from a Georgian village enclave and attempted to hit Russian forces moving along the detour Zara highway in the flank, but was stopped by Russian artillery fire and airstrikes.
During the evening of 8 August, vicious fighting took place in the area of Tskhinvali and in other parts of South Ossetia. The fighting in South Ossetian towns and villages was done by the local militia and volunteers, while Russian troops concentrated on engaging larger Georgian army groups. Three Tactical Battalion Groups of the 19th Motorized Rifle Division deployed in battle formation pushed Georgian forces from the roads and heights near Dzari, Kverneti, and Tbeti districts, and as far west as the western edge of Tskhinvali. Russia also undertook action to suppress Georgian artillery fire. Russian special units reportedly prevented Georgian saboteurs from blowing up the Roki Tunnel, which could have hindered the sending of reinforcements to South Ossetia. Russian media reported that exchanges of fire between Russian and Georgian troops continued throughout the night.
The passage of Russian forces through the narrow Roki Tunnel and along the mountain roads was slow and the Russians had difficulties in concentrating their troops, forcing them to bring their forces into battle battalion by battalion. Because of this, a fierce battle took place on 9 August in the region of Tskhinvali, and the Georgians were able to mount several counterattacks, including some with tanks. These attacks were repulsed with losses, and the Georgians were forced to withdraw. Because of the gradual increase in troops, the combined amassed Russian and South Ossetian forces in South Ossetia outnumbered the Georgians for the first time on 9–10 August. The Russians moved between 5,500 and 10,000 troops to South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel, according to Der Spiegel. On August 9, a Russian advance column led by Lieutenant-General Anatoly Khrulyov moved into Tskhinvali from the Roki Tunnel, and was ambushed by Georgian special forces. The column took heavy casualties, and all but five of its thirty armored vehicles were destroyed. Lieutenant-General Khrulyov was wounded in the leg by shrapnel. Russian Major Denis Vetchinov managed to organized a defense. Despite being hit in both legs, he killed a Georgian soldier with a trophy Georgian machine gun, but he was hit in the head by return fire and died en route to hospital. Vetchinov was awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation posthumously. Among the wounded were two Russian journalists embedded with the column. One Russian Su-24 was shot down by Georgian air defenses, and the Russian Air Force stopped flying sorties against Georgian targets until 10 August.
At 5:00 a.m., two Russian tanks of the 141st Independent Tank Battalion broke through the Georgian encirclement of the Russian peacekeeping camp, reinforcing the peacekeepers and allowing casualties to be evacuated. One tank was destroyed, and the other ran out of ammunition by nightfall.
The Georgians continued advancing through the city, and forced Russian and South Ossetian forces back in heavy street fighting. According to Moscow Defense Brief, by the morning of 10 August the Georgians had captured almost the whole of Tskhinvali, forcing Ossetian militia and Russian forces to retreat to the northern reaches of the city. A small tank battle took place, during which two Russian tanks (one T-62 and one T-72B) and a Georgian T-72Sim1 tank were destroyed. The Georgians also targeted Russian forces with artillery and airstrikes. However, the fighting reached a turning point toward the evening of 10 August, when Russian and Ossetian troops were fully bolstered by Russian reinforcements from the Roki Tunnel, and counterattacked. Georgian forces were cleared out of most of Tskhinvali, and forced to retreat to the south of the city. Georgian forces were also driven off the key Prisi heights. The bulk of Georgian artillery was defeated. Meanwhile, Ossetian forces supported by Russian divisions captured the villages of Tamarasheni, Kekhvi, Kurta, and Achabeti on the approach to Tskhinvali from the north, and pushed Georgian forces out of several enclaves. However, Georgian units in the area around the village of Zemo-Nikosi carried out a successful ambush against Russian forces, killing a number of soldiers and destroying several tanks. The village was captured shortly afterward by Chechen paramilitaries of the Vostok Battalion. Georgian artillery continued to shell Tskhinvali from a number of high points. On 11 August, the Georgian Air Force continued launching air attacks on Russian forces. A Russian Su-24 was shot down by Georgian air defenses, and a Georgian Su-25 was also shot down, but the pilot survived. According to Russian sources, Georgian artillery resumed shelling Tskhinvali, and a South Ossetian government representative claimed that Georgian troops opened the irrigation canal to flood basements and prevent civilians from seeking shelter. That information was never confirmed. Throughout the day, intense ground combat continued, and by the end of the day, Georgian forces had been completely pushed out of South Ossetia.
According to the Georgian Defense Minister, the Georgian military tried to push into Tskhinvali three times in all. During the last attempt, they were met with a very heavy Russian-led counterattack with air support, which Georgian officials described as "something like hell." In total, the fighting in the Tskhinvali area lasted for three days and nights, by the end of which Georgian artillery was forced from positions from which it could shell the city and Georgia's ground forces pulled completely out of South Ossetia.
Russian forces advanced into Georgia proper by the next morning. Having retreated from South Ossetia, the Georgian forces regrouped at Gori.
During its retreat out of South Ossetia into Gori, the Georgian forces were repeatedly hit by Russian air and artillery strikes which inflicted massive casualties upon mostly lightly armored vehicles and Infantry units in tight column formations. Hundreds were wounded and dozens killed. The attacks decisively dropped the fighting morale of the Georgian troops. The general withdrawal became chaotic in some areas and many Georgian soldiers used civilian vehicles to escape the bombing.
A skirmish occurred on 11 August, when a Georgian logistics column was hit hard by a Russian VDV detachment which' vehicles, a BMD-1 stood broken near a road to the town of Gori. The unit instantly opened heavy fire after having visual on the column killing a dozen Georgians. The soldiers in the Land Rover vehicles had little chance but a few still managed to escape the scene. Corpses gathered from the roads, were driven out with civilian vans and pickups. More than 70 dead were registered besides the 90 KIA in Tskhinvali and other parts of South Ossetia, what brought the total number of Georgian military casualties to 170 dead and hundreds of wounded.
Bombing and occupation of Gori.
Gori is a major Georgian city close to the administrative boundary of the region of South Ossetia, about from Tskhinvali. The Georgian Army used Gori as its staging area during the Battle of Tskhinvali, and the Russian Air Force bombed the city several times. Seventy-five tanks and armored personnel carriers—a third of the Georgian military's arsenal—were assembled near Gori. Georgian artillery units were also stationed near Gori.
According to western intelligence, the Russian bombings began at 7:30 a.m. 8 August, when Russia fired an SS-21 ballistic missile at military or government bunkers in the city of Borjomi, southwest of Gori. The first Russian air attack hit the village of Shavshvebi, located in the Gori District. Around 6 a.m. on 9 August, Reuters reported that two Russian fighters had bombed a Georgian artillery position near Gori. On 9 August, a Russian air attack targeted an arms depot. In the resulting explosion, several apartment buildings and a school were damaged. The Georgian government reported that 60 civilians were killed when at least one bomb hit an adjacent apartment building. According to the Russian military, Russian aircraft dropped three bombs on an armament depot, and the façade of one of the adjacent 5-story apartment buildings suffered damage as a result exploding ammunition from the depot. On August 12, a Russian cluster bomb attack hit the central square of the city, killing several Georgian civilians and Dutch journalist Stan Storimans, and injuring over 30. A helicopter-fired air-to-ground missile also struck the Gori military hospital, killing doctor Goga Abramashvili. The Georgian government also claimed that Russian bombing had hit the University of Gori, the post office, and the theater. Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international rights group, charged Russia with deploying controversial and indiscriminately deadly cluster bombs on civilian areas of Georgia.
On the evening of 10 August, large numbers of the civilian population began to flee the city and the surrounding area after the Georgian Interior Ministry declared Gori to be not safe. By the next day, 11 August, 56,000 people had fled the Gori District.
The Georgian Army expected that the Russians would attempt to take Gori, and Georgian troops, armored vehicles, and heavy artillery took positions 25 kilometers north of Gori, and anti-aircraft units were stationed inside the city. Following its defeat at Tskhinvali, the Georgian Army regrouped at Gori. Russian and South Ossetian forces established artillery positions inside Georgia proper. In the hours before the fall of Gori, sustained exchanges of artillery fire took place, and Russian jets bombed Georgian positions nine kilometers from the border. Six Georgian helicopter gunships also attacked targets inside South Ossetia.
After the Russians were confirmed to be advancing towards Gori, Georgian commanders ordered a retreat of all Georgian forces to defend Tbilisi. At 5 p.m. on 12 August, the Georgian Army began abandoning the city. A Times reporter described the Georgian withdrawal as "sudden and dramatic", saying that "the Gori residents watched in horror as their army abandoned their positions". According to Moscow Defense Brief, the retreat of the Georgian army from Gori soon grew into "a panicked flight" almost all the way to Tbilisi. Scores of Georgian tanks and armored personnel carries fled to Tbilisi, while a number of tanks were abandoned. Most artillery pieces were also taken to Tbilisi, but six assault guns were abandoned. A tank exploded and burned due to unspecified reasons, and an armored car pushing it out of the way also caught fire. Georgian infantry fled the city in military trucks and civilian vehicles. Five soldiers escaped the city on a Quad bike. Two military trucks crashed into each other while retreating from the city, and dozens of vehicles were left behind. Many of Gori's remaining inhabitants also fled the city, including hospital staff fleeing in ambulances.
On 13 August Russian ground forces entered Gori. Gori was completely clear of Georgian forces when the Russians entered. On 14 August, the Russian commander in charge of the troops occupying Gori, Major General Vyacheslav Borisov claimed that the city of Gori was controlled jointly by Georgian Police and Russian troops. He further said that Russian troops would start leaving Gori in two days. Russian troops said they were removing military hardware and ammunition from an abandoned arms depot outside Gori. Russian forces also captured numerous abandoned tanks, destroying 20 and taking away the rest. A Russian armored column left Gori, traveling along the main road to Tbilisi. A convoy of Georgian special forces traveling in pickup trucks was sent out to confront the Russians. After they were fifteen kilometers from the advancing Russian forces, they turned around and headed back towards Tbilisi. Russian forces halted their advance and camped out in a field fifteen kilometers from Gori. Georgian forces took defensive positions on the road six miles (about 10 km) closer to Tbilisi. The Russians then abandoned their positions and headed back towards Gori. The following day, Russian forces pushed to 34 miles (55 km) from Tbilisi, the closest during the war; they stopped in Igoeti , an important crossroads.
The Russian and Ossetian forces denied access to some humanitarian aid missions seeking to assist civilians. The United Nations, which described the humanitarian situation in Gori as desperate, was able to deliver only limited food supplies to the city. On 15 August, Russian troops allowed a number of humanitarian supplies into the city but continued their blockade. In the 17 August report, HRW said the organisation's researchers interviewed ethnic Georgians from the city of Gori and surrounding villages who described how armed South Ossetian militias attacked their cars and kidnapped civilians as people tried to flee in response to militia attacks on their homes following the Russian advance into the area. In phone interviews, people remaining in Gori region villages told HRW that they had witnessed looting and arson attacks by South Ossetian militias in their villages, but were afraid to leave after learning about militia attacks on those who fled. A Russian lieutenant said on 14 August: "We have to be honest. The Ossetians are marauding." Answering a journalist's question, a Russian lieutenant colonel said: "We're not a police force, we're a military force. It's not our job to do police work." The New York Times noted, that "the Russian military might be making efforts in some places to stop the rampaging". According to the Hague Convention, an occupying power has to "insure public order and safety in the occupied areas". The Russian human rights group Memorial called the attacks by South Ossetian militia "pogroms". On 14 August, efforts to institute joint patrols between the Russian Army and Georgian Police in Gori broke down because of apparent discord among personnel.
Georgian special forces in traveling pickup trucks repeatedly approached Gori to survey Russian positions, while Georgian Police set up roadblocks to prevent civilians from returning to the Russian-occupied city.
The occupation lasted until 22 August. Georgian Police then re-entered the city.
Abkhazian front.
On 9 August Russia opened a second front in Abkhazia, deploying up to 9,000 men from the 7th Novorossiysk and 76th Pskov Air Assault Divisions, elements of the 20th Motorised Rifle Division and two battalions of the Black Sea Fleet Marines, as well as 5,000 Abkhaz light infantry and artillery support. Abkhazian aircraft and artillery began a two-day bombardment against Georgian forces. The Russian Air Force bombed a Georgian military base in Senaki, killing 13 soldiers and wounding another 13. The base itself suffered heavy damage.
On 10 August Abkhazia declared a full military mobilisation to "drive out the 1,000 Georgian troops" from their remaining stronghold in the Kodori Valley. Russian forces secured the Georgian-controlled Khurcha settlement in Abkhazia on August 10.
Ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet left their base in Sevastopol, Ukraine, on the evening of 8 August for an unknown destination. On 10 August RIA-Novosti – quoting a source at the Russian Navy Main Staff – reported that a group of Russian warships had arrived at the maritime border with Georgia in the eastern part of the Black Sea. "In the morning of Sunday 10 August, the Black Sea Fleet flagship, the missile cruiser Moskva, destroyer Smetlivyy and auxiliary vessels from the Black Sea Fleet base in Sevastopol reached the intended area", the source was quoted as saying. According to the source, the warships joined three large Russian landing-ships, which had deployed to the area earlier from Sevastopol and from Novorossiysk. "The objective of the Black Sea Fleet's warships in the area is to be prepared to provide assistance to refugees", the source said. He denied earlier media reports that the warships were enforcing a blockade of Georgia's coast. "A naval blockade would indicate war with Georgia. We are not at war with Georgia." The flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, the missile cruiser , and the escort ship "Smetlivyy" entered the port of Novorossiysk on Sunday 10 August and dropped anchor, according to sources in the Novorossiysk administration. On the evening of 10 August a naval skirmish between the Russian task-force and several Georgian naval vessels took place. According to Russia, two Georgian missile-boats and two auxiliary craft breached the Russian declared "security zone" around the Russian ships. Reportedly the Russian Nanuchka III class corvette "Mirazh" (Mirage) destroyed the Georgian Coast Guard patrol-cutter "Giorgi Toreli" with two Malakhit (SS-N-9) anti-ship missiles, killing 30 sailors. (The Georgian side has never acknowledged that this battle or the loss of a Georgian ship ever took place.) This action constituted the Russian Navy's first real sea battle since 1945. The Russians claimed that Georgian ships had violated the security zone of their deployed ships and therefore the action represented self-defense in accordance with international law. Following the action, the remaining Georgian ships withdrew to a nearby harbour.
On August 11, Russian paratroopers deployed in Abkhazia carried out raids against military bases deep inside Georgian territory, from where Georgia could send reinforcements to its troops in South Ossetia. Russian forces, meeting virtually no resistance, reached the military base near the town of Senaki in undisputed Georgian territory on 11 August, destroying the base there and capturing four tanks. During a reconnaissance mission, the Russian Air Force shot down two Georgian helicopters at the airbase at Senaki. Russian troops also drove through the port of Poti, and occupied positions around it. On 12 August, the Abkhazian authorities announced the beginning of a military offensive against Georgian troops in the Kodori Gorge area. The Georgian government claimed that Abkhaz infantry and armor was attacking Georgian defenses in the Kodori Valley. Abkhaz forces took the villages of Azhara and Chkhalta, and a group of 250 Abkhaz soldiers was reported to have clashed with Georgian forces in the Gorge at the edge of Abkhazia. On the same day, Georgia said it was withdrawing its troops from the Kodori Gorge as a gesture of goodwill. Clashes between Georgian and Abkhazian forces lasted until 13 August, when all of the remaining Georgian forces, as well as 1,500 civilian residents, left Kodori Valley for Georgia proper. Casualties were light on both sides. One Abkhazian soldier was killed in action and two wounded during the fighting. Two Georgian soldiers were also killed.
Bombing and occupation of Poti.
Russian aircraft had attacked the city on August 9, bombing the port and a nearby airbase. Most of the Georgian Navy and Georgian Coast Guard escaped to Batumi during the conflict, but some vessels were left behind. On 14 August, Russian troops entered Poti and sank three Georgian naval vessels moored in the harbour, as well as removing or destroying military equipment. The Russians also seized the highway linking Poti to Tbilisi. Four days later, Russian forces in Poti took prisoner 22 Georgian troops who had approached the city. They were taken to a Georgian military base occupied by Russian troops at Senaki. The Russians seized four Georgian Humvees in that same action. From 13–15 August, according to Moscow Defence Brief, "Russian paratroops raided Poti again and again, destroying almost all of the docked ships and boats of the Georgian Navy, and took away a quantity of valuable military equipment."
Bombing of Tbilisi.
During fighting in South Ossetia, Tbilisi and its surrounding areas came under repeated attack by the Russian Air Force. On 8 August, the Georgian Interior Ministry reported that a Russian fighter dropped two bombs on Vaziani Military Base near Tbilisi, killing three soldiers. Russian fighters also bombed a military airfield near Marneuli, killing four and wounding five. According to the Georgian Interior Ministry, Russian aircraft dropped three bombs on Tbilisi International Airport early on August 10. Reuters correspondents in Tbilisi reported hearing three loud bangs in the early-morning hours. Russia denied bombing the airport. Russia also bombed the Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing plant (located next to Vaziani Military Base), resulting in an unspecified amount of damage. On August 11, Russia bombed a radar station near Tbilisi.
Six-point peace plan.
On 10 August most international observers began calling for a peaceful solution to the conflict. The European Union and the United States expressed a willingness to send a joint delegation to try to negotiate a ceasefire. Russia, however, ruled out peace talks with Georgia until the latter withdrew from South Ossetia and signed a legally binding pact renouncing the use of force against South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
On 12 August, Russian President Medvedev said that he had ordered an end to military operations in Georgia, saying that "the operation has achieved its goal, security for peacekeepers and civilians has been restored. The aggressor was punished, suffering huge losses." Later on the same day, he met the President-in-Office of the European Union, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and approved a six-point peace plan. Late that night Georgian President Saakashvili agreed to the text. Sarkozy's plan originally had just the first four points. Russia added the fifth and sixth points. Georgia asked for the additions in parentheses, but Russia rejected them, and Sarkozy convinced Georgia to agree to the unchanged text. On 14 August, South Ossetia President Eduard Kokoity and Abkhazia President Sergei Bagapsh signed the peace plan as well.
After the cease fire had been signed, hostilities did not immediately stop. According to Moscow Defence Brief, active raids on bases inside Georgian territory to capture and destroy Georgian weapons and equipment, in what was termed the "demilitarization of the Georgian Armed Forces". Noting that people were fleeing before the still advancing Russian tanks and soldiers and the following irregulars, a reporter for the UK "The Guardian" stated on 13 August, "the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous." On 15 August, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also travelled to Tbilisi, where Saakashvili signed the 6-point peace plan in her presence. Russia and Georgia exchanged prisoners of war on 19 August. Georgia said it handed over 5 Russian servicemen, in exchange for 13 Georgians soldiers and 2 civilians, but said that it suspected Russia of holding 2 more Georgians prisoner.
Aftermath.
Russian withdrawal.
Despite numerous calls for a quick withdrawal from Georgia by western leaders, Russian troops remained stationed inside some parts of Georgia proper for about two months. Beginning on 17 August, some troops withdrew. However, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori as well as in so-called buffer zones near the borders with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and two Russian observer posts remained near Poti. On 19 August, all Russian troops in Gori withdrew to South Ossetia, but a platoon continued to man a checkpoint near Nasreti. Civilian refugees returned, and the military base was re-occupied by the Georgian Army. All Russian forces in Senaki also withdrew to Abkhazia. On 23 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti, and were replaced by Georgian police. On 10 September, Russian forces withdrew from their checkpoints in western Georgia, and reduced their forces near Poti. A Georgian police officer was shot and killed several hundred meters from a Russian checkpoint in Karaleti, twelve miles from South Ossetia. Russian forces denied responsibility, saying that it may have been perpetrated by South Ossetian militia. On 6 October, Russian troops dismantled and withdrew from a checkpoint in Nabakhtevi. On 1 October, a Russian truck strayed out of the Russian buffer zone near South Ossetia, and was stopped by Georgian police. The truck was found to be carrying explosives and jamming equipment, which was confiscated and shown to the media. The driver, an eighteen-year-old soldier from North Ossetia, was arrested and interrogated at a police station in Mtskheta. He was subsequently put in front of the media and allowed to answer questions from journalists before being handed over to OSCE observers. On 9 October, Russian forces withdrew from the buffer zones and dismantled all their checkpoints. Georgian Army and police forces and civilians subsequently returned. The withdrawal was observed by European Union monitors. A single checkpoint in the border village of Perevi remained. On December 12, Russian forces withdrew from Perevi, and were replaced by Georgian police. Hours later, a 500-strong Russian contingent re-occupied Perevi, and Georgian police withdrew after the Russians threatened to fire. Russian forces established three checkpoints in the village. On 18 October 2010, all Russian troops in Perevi withdrew to South Ossetia after dismantling the checkpoints, and were replaced by a Georgian Army unit. On 9 September 2008, Russia officially announced that its troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia would "henceforth be considered foreign troops stationed in independent states under bilateral agreements". Georgia considers Abkhazia and South Ossetia "Russian-occupied territories". Russia maintains 3,700 soldiers in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia and opened military bases in Java, Tskhinvali, and Gudauta in 2010.
Russia spent $400 million on the bases. In August 2010, Russia deployed S-300 long-range air defense missiles in Abkhazia, and other air defense systems in South Ossetia. Britain and France both criticized Russia for this move. According to the British House of Lords, Russia is in violation of the six-point peace plan by keeping troops stationed in areas it did not previously control. The French government said that Russia was not yet fulfilling its commitments to the six-point peace plan.
On October 3, 2008, seven Russian soldiers were killed and another seven wounded by a car bomb that exploded near the Russian peacekeeping headquarters. According to South Ossetian sources, the car had been found by Russian soldiers in a Georgian village, and had been confiscated and taken to the base, where it blew up. The Russian and South Ossetian governments blamed the Georgian Security Ministry for the attack, saying that it was an attempt to undermine the cease-fire, while Georgia claimed that Russia had organized the explosion as an excuse to maintain its presence in South Ossetia.
International monitors.
, there are 283 EU ceasefire monitors operating in Georgia. Previous mandates of OSCE monitors (in South Ossetia) and the UN (UNOMIG, Abkhazia and Georgia) expired on 1 January and June 16 respectively. Russia vetoed the extension of the mandates, arguing that the mandates did not properly reflect Russia's position of recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. According to the head of the UN mission, Johan Verbeke, roughly 60,000 ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia will be left unprotected after the mission's end. OSCE monitors had been denied access to South Ossetia since the war.
A number of incidents have occurred in both border conflict zones since the war ended, and tensions between the belligerents remain high.
Humanitarian impact and war crimes.
According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), all parties committed serious violations of international human rights and
humanitarian law, resulting in many civilian deaths and injuries. Georgian forces used indiscriminate force during their attack on South Ossetia "with blatant disregard for the safety of civilians." The Georgians directed tank and machine gun fire at buildings in Tskhinvali, including at apartment buildings and basements where civilians sheltered. South Ossetian forces had fired on Georgian forces from at least some of these buildings. The Georgian military used BM-21 Grad MRLs, a multiple rocket launch system, to destroy targets situated in civilian areas. The Russian military has also used indiscriminate force in attacks in South Ossetia and in the Gori district, and has apparently targeted convoys of civilians attempting to flee the conflict zones. Russian warplanes bombed civilian population centres in Georgia, and Georgian villages in South Ossetia. A Russian bombing in the Georgian city of Gori killed 60 civilians and wounded scores more. Armed gangs and Ossetian militia committed looting, arson attacks, rape and abductions in Georgian villages and towns, terrorising the civilian population, forcing them to flee their homes and preventing displaced people from returning home. In the Georgian city of Gori, Ossetian militia terrorised the civilian population and attacked anyone who tried to flee. The Georgian Army had retreated to defend Tbilisi, and did not return until the Russians and Ossetians withdrew.
HRW further reports that both Georgians and Russians used cluster bombs of the types M85S and RBK 250, resulting in civilian casualties. Georgia admits using cluster bombs against Russian troops and the Roki tunnel. Georgia was also reported to have used cluster munitions twice to hit civilians fleeing from the battle zone through the main escape route. Russia denies the use of cluster bombs, but is accused of having used them in its attacks against Gori, Ruisi and Karbi. HRW called the conflict a disaster for civilians. HRW also called for international organisations to send fact-finding missions to establish the facts, report on human rights, and urged the authorities to account for any crimes.
On 8 September Thomas Hammarberg, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a report titled "Human Rights in Areas Affected by the South Ossetia Conflict" stating that during the conflict "a very large number of people had been victimised. More than half of the population in South Ossetia fled, the overwhelming majority of them after the Georgian artillery and tank attack on Tskhinvali and the assaults on Georgian villages by South Ossetian militia and criminal gangs." The report also states that the main Tskhinvali hospital had been hit by rockets, that some "residential areas in the city" of Tskhinvali were "completely destroyed" and "the main building of the Russian peace keeping force as well as the base's medical dispensary had been hit by heavy artillery." Furthermore, the villages with ethnic Georgian majority between Tskhinvali and Java "have been destroyed, reportedly by South Ossetian militia and criminal gangs."
According to Human Rights Watch, during the August war, South Ossetian militias burned and looted most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia, effectively preventing 20,000 residents displaced by the conflict from returning. Furthermore, the civilians willing to live in South Ossetia are obliged to accept a Russian passport in order to be authorised to. According to Memorial the villages of Kekhvi, Kurta, Achabeti, Tamarasheni, Eredvi, Vanati and Avnevi have been "virtually fully burnt down". South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity stated in an interview that Georgian villages were successfully demolished and none of the Georgian refugees would be allowed to return. A total of 30,000 Georgians became refugees. The EU commission stated that "several elements suggest the conclusion that ethnic cleansing was indeed practised against ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia both during and after the August 2008 conflict".
In the weeks following the conflict, the Georgian government began building numerous settlements throughout the country to permanently accommodate Georgian refugees.
In November 2008, Amnesty International released a 69 page report detailing serious international law violations on the conduct of war by both Georgia and Russia. The great majority of those killed in the war were civilians. Russian and South Ossetian officials initially claimed that up to 2,000 Ossetian civilians were killed by Georgian forces. These high casualty figures, are according to Russia the reason for the military intervention in Georgia. Almost one year after the conflict, Georgia has reported more than 413 deaths. Based on reports by Thomas Hammarberg, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, The estimate the Commissioner received from the Russian authorities on confirmed deaths was 133 people in Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia. Human Rights in Areas Affected by the South Ossetia Conflict. Special Mission to Georgia and Russian Federation] On the other hand, the false claims of high casualties may have significantly influenced public sentiment among Ossetians. According to Human Rights Watch, some of the Ossetian residents they interviewed justified the torching and looting of the Georgian villages by referring to "thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia", as reported by Russian federal TV channels. Stan Storimans, a Dutch journalist, was the only foreigner killed in the conflict.
Both sides have filed complaints with various international courts, including the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice (where the written pleadings in the case Georgia vs Russian Federation start on 2 September 2009) and the European Court of Human Rights, against each other.
Infrastructure damage.
On 12 August local authorities stated that approximately 70% of Tskhinvali's buildings, both municipal and private, had suffered damage during the Georgian offensive. According to later statements made by Russian and Ossetian sources, about 20% of the Tskhinvali's buildings had suffered various damage, including an estimate of 700, or about 10% of the city's buildings, as being "beyond repair".
According to Human Rights Watch, on the night of 7 to 8 August, Georgian forces shelled the city of Tskhinvali and several nearby Ossetian villages heavily. Tskhinvali was also heavily shelled during daytime hours on 8 August. HRW reports that South Ossetian fighters took up positions in civilian locations, including schools and a kindergarten, turning them into legitimate military targets. Several of these locations were then hit by Georgian artillery. Shelling resumed at a smaller scale on 9 August, when Georgian forces were targeting Russian troops who by then had moved into Tskhinvali and other areas of South Ossetia. The organisation has discovered evidence of widespread destruction in Tskhinvali caused by indiscriminate fire from Georgian artillery and rocket launchers. Tskhinvali residents are almost unanimous in blaming the Georgian troops for the destruction of the city.
The Georgian side maintains that the Russian Army should be held responsible for heavy damage and destruction of buildings and infrastructure in Tskhinvali, as it was bombing the city for three days. "When aircraft started bombing our positions in Tskhinvali, this is when most civilian buildings were burned", explained Davit Kezerashvili. Russian journalist Julia Latinina also blames Russia for damaging the city. According to a Georgian police officer, "the city was unimpaired" when they entered into it.
Russia bombed airfields and economic infrastructure, including the Black Sea port of Poti. Between eight and eleven Russian jets reportedly hit container tanks and a shipbuilding plant at the port. On 16 August 2008, Russian forces advancing towards Tbilisi blew up the railway bridge near Kaspi, about outside of the Georgian capital, thus cutting the link between Eastern and Western Georgia as well as the main transport link between landlocked Armenia and the Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi and Poti. The cement factory and civilian area in Kaspi were also reportedly damaged by Russian air-raids.
From 19 August onwards the UN Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) released a series of detailed satellite maps of the regions affected by the war via its Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT). All damage is assessed from satellite images (with a resolution of up to 60 cm), however it is not independently validated on the ground. For Tskhinvali, UNOSAT reports 230 (5.5% of the total) of buildings either destroyed or severely damaged. In the villages to the north of Tskhinvali (controlled by Georgia previous to the war) between 5.4% and 51.9% of the total buildings were affected. Human Rights Watch (HRW) used the images to support the claim that widespread torching of ethnic Georgian villages by Ossetian militia had occurred inside South Ossetia. With regard to the city of Poti, UNOSAT provided imagery that witnesses a total of 6 Georgian naval vessels either "partially or completely submerged". "No other damage to physical infrastructure or vessel-related oil spills" were detected.
Many countries and institutions promised reconstruction aid for the affected regions.
Responsibility for the war and motives.
Even before the war ended, the question of responsibility for the armed conflict emerged, with the warring parties taking different positions. In response, several international organisations conducted investigations, including a large EU fact finding mission. The majority of experts, monitors and ambassadors agreed that the war was started by Georgia shelling Tskhinvali, but that Russia responded with disproportionate measures. The Tagliavini commission concluded that while Georgia could have responded to the separatist attacks, it could not justify the full scale attack on Tskhinvali.
Independent international fact-finding mission.
An independent international fact-finding mission headed by Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini was established by the EU to determine the causes of the war. The commission was given a budget of €1.6 million and also incorporated earlier reports by the OSCE, HRW and other organisations.
The Report stated that conflict started "with a massive Georgian artillery attack...against the town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008", but was "...mere culmination of series of provocations..." and that all sides share responsibility. The beginning of the armed conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia is dated at 7 August 2008 at 23.35, while the open hostilities between Georgia and Russia are considered to have started on 8 August 2008. It also noted that Georgian attack on 7 August was a response, albeit not proportionate, to South Ossetian attacks in the following paragraphs:
The Report claimed that Russian citizenship, conferred to the vast part of Abkhaz and Ossetians may not be considered legally binding under international law. As a result, the interests of these people may not be used as a reason for starting military actions, in defense of Russian citizens living abroad.
While the report acknowledged the presence of some non-peacekeeping Russian troops in South Ossetia, their presence did not justify the initial Georgian attack. The report also stated that "the use of force by Georgia against Russian peacekeeping forces in Tskhinvali in the night of 7/8 August 2008 would be contrary to international law". The report said that "if the Russian peacekeepers were attacked", then "the immediate reaction in defense of Russian peacekeepers" would be justified, as "Russia had the right to defend its peacekeepers, using military means proportionate to the attack" (the report did not have facts to substantiate the claimed attack on the peacekeepers, but found it "likely" that Russian PKF casualties occurred). The later, second, part of Russian actions, is characterised as "the invasion of Georgia by Russian armed forces reaching far beyond the administrative boundary of South Ossetia", and is considered to be "beyond the reasonable limits of defence". With respect to the war's second theater, the report found the Abkhaz/Russian attack on the Kodori Gorge was not justified under international law.
Combatants' positions.
Georgia first claimed that its attack responded to Ossetian shelling of Georgian villages, and that it aimed to "restore constitutional order" in South Ossetia. Later, Saakashvili said the aim of the Georgian attack was to counter a Russian invasion. During a United Nations Security Council meeting on 8 August Georgia said that the first Russian troops entered South Ossetia at 05:30 am on 8 August. In a decree ordering the general mobilisation, which was published on 9 August, Saakashvili noted that the Russian troops had advanced through the Roki tunnel on 8 August, which was after the Georgian attack. The Georgian government later changed its position, saying that around 11:30 p.m. on 7 August intelligence information was received that 150 Russian army vehicles had entered Georgian territory through the Roki Tunnel. In an interview with Der Spiegel, Saakashvili said "we wanted to stop the Russian troops before they could reach Georgian villages. When our tanks moved toward Tskhinvali, the Russians bombed the city. They were the ones – not us – who reduced Tskhinvali to rubble." Georgia released intercepted telephone calls purporting to show that part of a Russian armoured regiment crossed into the separatist enclave of South Ossetia nearly a full day before Georgia's attack on the capital, Tskhinvali, late on August 7. However, in a later article published on 6 November, "The New York Times" said that "neither Georgia nor its Western allies have as yet provided conclusive evidence that Russia was invading the country or that the situation for Georgians in the Ossetian zone was so dire that a large-scale military attack was necessary" and that the phone intercepts published by Georgia did not show the Russian column's size, composition or mission, and that "there has not been evidence that it was engaged with Georgian forces until many hours after the Georgian bombardment."
Russia says it acted to defend Russian citizens in South Ossetia, and its own peacekeepers stationed there. The Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia suffered casualties during the initial Georgian artillery barrage on Tskhinvali and were besieged by Georgian troops for two days until a Russian unit broke through to their camp and started evacuating the wounded at 5 a.m. on 9 August. According to a senior Russian official, the first Russian combat unit was ordered to move through the Roki Tunnel at around dawn of 8 August well after the Georgian attack had begun. Defending Russia's decision to launch attacks on uncontested Georgia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said that Russia had no choice but to target the military infrastructure being used to sustain the Georgian offensive. Initially, Russia went as far as accusing Georgia of committing genocide against Ossetians, noting that Georgia codenamed their attack "Operation Clear Field"
The independent EU commission found no evidence for the alleged genocide and ruled the extension of operations into uncontested Georgia illegal. Russia codenamed its operation "Operation Forcing Georgia to peace".
After 3 years from August War, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev admitted NATO would have been expanded to admit ex-Soviet republics if Russia had not invaded Georgia in 2008 to defend a rebel region. "If you...had faltered back in 2008, the geopolitical situation would be different now," Medvedev said in a speech to soldiers at a base in Vladikavkaz. In August 2012, Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had drawn up a plan to counter a Georgian attack long before the August 2008 conflict in the Caucasus. He said the plan was developed by the Russian General Staff in late 2006-early 2007 and it was negotiated with Putin, who was serving his second presidential term in that period. According to Putin, they "trained South Ossetian militia under this plan."
South Ossetia's government in Tskhinvali said that it called for Russian help once the Georgian bombardment of their capital city, Tskhinvali, started, in order to prevent genocide and was relieved when the 58th Army intervened to assist against, what Ossetians called "the most frightful fire". A Latin American journalist, Raul Fajardo who was visiting South Ossetia, stated: "I am confident that if it had not been for Russia and the courage of the Ossetian soldiers who defended their homeland, mankind would have regretted today the genocide of the Ossetian people, the irretrievable loss of the people with a unique history, traditions and culture".
The South Ossetian government further called into question Georgia's assertion that Russian forces were bombing Tskhinvali, because the South Ossetian Minister of Defence, Vasiliy Lunev, was in command of the Russian Army after the wounding of Russian General Anatoly Khrulyov. South Ossetia stated that Saakashvili's brutal attack on their country is simply a continuation of Georgia's aggressive behavior, demonstrated in the 1920s, the early 1990s and Saakashvili's feeble attempt in 2004.
Reactions to the conflict.
International reaction.
In response to the war, Russia faced strong criticism from the US, the United Kingdom, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the Baltic states.
Recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by the Russian Federation.
On 25 August 2008, the Federal Assembly of Russia unanimously voted to urge President Medvedev to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. On 26 August 2008, Medvedev agreed, signing a decree officially recognising the two entities, and in a televised address to the Russian people expressed his opinion that recognising the independence of the two republics "represents the only possibility to save human lives." Nicaragua recognised the republics on 5 September 2008. In January 2009, Belarus said it would make a decision on recognising South Ossetia and Abkhazia on 2 April, but the European Union demanded that Belarus not recognise the republics and threatened to cancel Belarus' invitation to its Eastern Partnership programme. According to Peter Rutland, the EU has rewarded the Belarusian President Lukashenko for his non-recognition of the republics by suspending the travel ban for top Belarusian officials that had been imposed in 2004.
The unilateral recognition by Russia was met by condemnation from NATO, the OSCE Chairman, the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, Foreign Ministers of the G7, and the government of Ukraine because of the violation of Georgia's territorial integrity, and United Nations Security Council resolutions. Russia sought support for its recognition from the states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (the biggest members are Russia and China). However, because of concerns about their own separatist regions in states of the SCO, especially in China, the SCO did not back the recognition. According to Alexei Vlassov from Moscow State University, even Russia's closest allies did not show any willingness to support Moscow.
On 10 September 2009 President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez announced Venezuela recognises Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, making it a third UN member to support South Ossetian independence. On 15 December 2009 Nauru recognized and established diplomatic relations with Abkhazia.
As of 2011, only six states have recognized Abkhazia and 5 states have recognized South Ossetia as sovereign states, respectively.
Severance of diplomatic relations between Georgia and Russia.
Georgia has rejected this move outright as an annexation of its territory. In response to Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Georgian government announced that the country cut all diplomatic relations with Russia.
Russia had already closed its embassy right after the beginning of the war, before diplomatic relations between the two countries ended.
Georgia also announced in August 2008 that it would leave the Commonwealth of Independent States, which it saw as dominated by Russia and its allies. The departure became effective on August 2009.
Media.
Independent media coverage and access to information were limited as the conflict continued to unfold. Cyber-warfare fuelled claims of distributed denial of service, censorship, propaganda, and disinformation from all sides, and restricted access for journalists made it difficult to verify the allegations. The Georgian government stopped translation of Russian TV channels and blocked access to Russian websites, during the war and its aftermath, limiting news coverage in Georgia. Georgian, Russian, South Ossetian, and Azerbaijani websites were attacked by hackers, causing a breakdown of local servers.
According to Nicolai N. Petro, Professor of Politics at the University of Rhode Island, Western media coverage of the war was biased at first, but became more balanced in November, 2008, when two OSCE officials Ryan Grist and Stephen Young confirmed the Russian version of events — that the Georgian attack was unprovoked and indiscriminate. Professor Petro said that initial impressions conveyed by respected news outlets tend to linger on, even if the story later changes radically, and "it is therefore not surprising that American pundits and politicians continue to refer to the events of last August as 'Russian aggression,' even though subsequent reporting has debunked this as a myth."
NATO reaction in the Black Sea.
NATO increased its naval presence in the Black Sea significantly,
with ships docking in Georgian ports, and, according to the U.S. Navy, delivering humanitarian aid. NATO stressed that the increased presence in the Black Sea was not related to the current tensions and that the vessels were conducting routine visits and carrying out pre-planned naval exercises.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev did not address NATO directly but questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were only rendering humanitarian assistance and alleged delivery of military support. Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limitations on the number of vessels allowed in the Black Sea, under the 1936 Montreux convention, and warned Western nations against violating the Convention.
According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the United States maintained an uninterrupted naval presence in the Black Sea, which is constrained by the Montreux Convention's limitations on naval tonnage and the duration of naval visits, and rotated its ships in the Black Sea at intervals consistent with that convention.

Military analysis.
Georgia.
U.S. analysts mention that the air defense was "one of the few effective elements of the country's military" and credit the SA-11 Buk-1M with shooting down a Tupolev-22MR recon and contributing to the losses of the 3 Su-25s. The view was mirrored by independent Russian analysis and by Russia's deputy chief of General Staff, Col. Gen. Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, who said the Russian-made Tor and Buk anti-aircraft missile systems that Georgia had bought from Ukraine were responsible for the downings of 4 Russian aircraft in the war. A Russian assessment reported by Roger McDermott found that Russian losses would have been significantly higher had the Georgians not abandoned a portion of their SAM systems in western Georgia. Georgia also possessed Israeli-made SPYDER-SR short-range self-propelled anti-aircraft systems, according to some reports. The Georgian air defence early warning and command control tactical system was connected to a NATO Air Situation Data Exchange (ASDE) through Turkey, allowing Georgia to receive data directly from the unified NATO air-defence system.
Georgia has said that its principal vulnerabilities, which proved decisive, were its comparative weakness to Russian air power and its inability to communicate effectively in combat. Konstantin Makienko of CAST saw inadequate pilot training as the main reason behind the low efficiency of Georgian air raids. The Georgian Air Force provided heavy air support in the opening hours, but played a minimal role throughout the rest of the conflict, though it managed to fly sorties against Russian forces until 11 August. According to Batu Kutelia, Georgia's first deputy defence minister, in the future Georgia will need a very sophisticated, multi-layered air-defense system to defend all its airspace. However, Western military officers who have experience working with Georgian military forces suggest that Georgia's military shortfalls were serious and too difficult to change merely by upgrading equipment. According to an article published in the New York Times on 3 September, "Georgia's Army fled ahead of the Russian Army's advance, turning its back and leaving Georgian civilians in the enemy's path. Its planes did not fly after the first few hours of contact. Its navy was sunk in the harbor, and its patrol boats were hauled away by Russian trucks on trailers."
Georgia's logistical preparations were poor and its units interfered with each other in the field. During the initial Georgian offensive, a well-executed Georgian attack captured most of Tskhinvali and South Ossetia, and special forces successfully ambushed the Russian advance column, but throughout the following days, Georgian forces were dislodged from South Ossetia by a fierce Russian and Ossetian counteroffensive, largely relying on artillery and air support. Georgian Naval Forces were defeated with the loss of a coast guard cutter during a naval skirmish off Abkhazia. During the Russian and Abkhaz offensive, Georgian forces only put up only minimal resistance before withdrawing, having inflicted and suffered light casualties. Communications systems failed in the mountains and had to be replaced by communication via mobile phones. Planning was similarly lacking. According to Giorgi Tavdgiridze, there were no calculations on how to block the Roki Tunnel, connecting North and South Ossetia. Furthermore, the arrival of 10,000 Georgian reservists to Gori on 9 August was poorly organized: not given specific targets, the reservists returned to Tbilisi on August 10. During Russian and Ossetian raids into Georgian territory, the Georgian Army offered no resistance, and retreated to defend Tbilisi. It left behind some of its military equipment, which was captured by the Russians. After Russian forces occupied Poti, they sunk or towed away all naval boats still in harbor: The rest fled to Batumi. According to their American trainers, the Georgian soldiers did not lack "warrior spirit", but were not ready for combat. Georgia lacked well-trained and educated officers in the higher ranks, and neither Saakashvili nor his Defence Minister Davit Kezerashvili had any military experience, and yet they both still commanded troops in battle.
Russia.
The Russian Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C³I) performed poorly during the conflict. The communication systems used were obsolete, resulting in one case where the commander of the 58th army was reported to have communicated with his forces in the midst of combat via a satellite phone borrowed from a journalist. Due to the absence of the modern GLONASS, precision-guided munitions could not be used since the US controlled GPS was unavailable due to the war zone being blacked out. Furthermore, the Russian defense minister had failed to authorize the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, and an editorial in RIA Novosti said that Russian forces lacked dependable aerial reconnaissance systems, leading to the use of a Tupolev Tu-22M3 long-range bomber on a reconnaissance mission, where it was subsequently shot down, and all of its crewmembers were killed or captured. Nevertheless, most of the reconnaissance was performed by three Russian reconnaissance battalions, so the need to use a strategic bomber for it was questionable.
A total of three Russian aircraft were shot down during the war, and Georgian air defenses were only driven off or destroyed by ground attacks, as the air force was unable to suppress them. The Russian Air Force was never able to fully stop aerial attacks by the Georgian Air Force, which was still flying sorties against Russian troops on August 11. The RIA Novosti editorial also stated that Russian Su-25 ground attack jets still lacked radar sights, computers for calculating ground-target coordinates and long-range air-to-surface missiles that could be launched outside enemy air-defence areas. Opposition affiliated Russian analyst Konstantin Makienko pointed out the poor performance of the Russian Air Force: "It is totally unbelievable that the Russian Air Force was unable to establish air superiority almost to the end of the five-day war, despite the fact that the enemy had no fighter aviation."
After a close examination of the Russian Air Force's performance, Russian avionics expert Anton Lavrov pointed out that Russian MiG-29s established air superiority within a few hours of Russia's entry, and prevented the Georgian Air Force from supporting their assault on Tskhinvali. The Russians also flew 63 sorties on August 8, mostly by Su-25s when the Georgian Air Defense failed to shoot down a single Russian plane. According to Lavrov, Georgian air defenses failed to shoot down the three Russian Su-25s which were lost, claiming that they were lost to friendly fire, most likely either by "Igla" or "Strela" anti-air missiles. Lavrov asserts that the Tu-22M shot down was not used for scouting: On August 9, a wing of 4 Tu-22Ms completed their bombing run, and for unknown reasons descended from 16,000 to 4,000 meters, where one of them was shot down by a Georgian "Osa" AA missile. As a result, the Russians suspended all Tu-22M sorties for the rest of the war. Georgian air defenses shot down 2 Su-24s: One on August 9, by a Grom-2, another on August 11, by either an Igla or Strela.
There was also confusion surrounding the nature of the command relationship between the North Caucasus Military District commander and the Air Force. The Air Force operations were being directed by Air Force commander-in-chief Colonel-General Aleksandr Zelin, who commanded the air forces from his office on his mobile phone, without entering the command post. He decided all matters related to the conduct of air operations and did not even consider it necessary to invite his air defense assistants to a meeting. Furthermore, the Air Force was accused of failing to support ground combat operations.
Commenting on the performance of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Swedish analysts Carolina Vendil Pallin and Fredrik Westerlund noted, that although the fleet never met any serious opposition, it still showed that it is a force to be reckoned with. Being able to plan and carry through manoeuvres of the size which were carried out during the war required considerable skills, according to the analysts.
American researchers working for the Heritage foundation praised the comprehensive and systematic planning of the Russian general staff, stating that, the operations "were well prepared and well executed" and that the Russian offensive achieved a strategic surprise. A Reuters analyst described Russia's army in light of the conflict as "strong but flawed." According to him, the war showed that Russia's "armed forces have emerged from years of neglect as a formidable fighting force, but revealed important deficiencies". The weaknesses, especially in missiles and air capability, leave Russia still lagging behind the image of a world-class military power it projects to the rest of the world. In contrast to the weak conscript soldiers used in Chechnya, Russia's force in Georgia was largely composed of professional soldiers. Reuters reporters on the ground in Georgia saw disciplined, well-equipped troops. Ruslan Pukhov, director of Russia's Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, stated that "the victory over the Georgian army should become for Russia not a cause for euphoria and excessive joy, but serve to speed up military transformations in Russia." Roger McDermott speculated that the (compared to earlier Russian conflicts) high level of criticism in the media after the conflict is part of "an orchestrated effort by the government to "sell" reform to the military and garner support among the populace."
However, the Russian Army's performance on the ground has come under scrutiny. Although the majority of soldiers deployed in the conflict zone were professionals, some were conscripts. General Vladimir Boldyrev admitted in September 2008 that many of the professional soldiers were no better trained than conscripts. Some of the soldiers deployed were servicemen from special ethnic minorities' units, mostly Chechens from the Vostok and Zapad Battalions. According to Georgian refugees, these servicemen showed little discipline or respect for the laws of war. Much of the ground fighting was carried out by Russian Airborne Troops, who could not be airlifted behind Georgian lines due to the Russian Air Force's inability to suppress Georgian air defenses. The 58th Army's advance column, led by General Anatoly Khrulyov, ran directly into a Georgian ambush as it entered South Ossetia on 9 August, due to poor intelligence. Only five of the thirty vehicles in the convoy survived, and the column took heavy casualties, including General Khrulyov himself, who was wounded in the leg. Many Russian ground units were insufficiently supplied with ammunition, which led to additional losses.
Georgian order of battle.
The Georgian army consisted of 4 regular infantry brigades, plus a fifth brigade in the process of formation. One artillery brigade was stationed at Gori and Khoni and a tank battalion was also stationed at Gori.
According to International Institute for Strategic Studies, when the war started, the Georgians had amassed ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th infantry brigades as well as special forces and an artillery brigade, in all, about 12,000 troops near the South Ossetian conflict zone. The 4th Brigade carried out the main mission of attempting to capture Tskhinvali, while the 2nd and 3rd Brigades provided support. Of all Georgian military units, the 4th Brigade suffered the heaviest casualties.
The 1st infantry brigade, the only one trained to a NATO level, served in Iraq at the start of the war. Two to three days later the U.S. Air Force airlifted it to Georgia, too late to take part in the Battle of Tskhinvali.
Units Deployed:
Military instructors and alleged use of foreign mercenaries.
At the outbreak of the war 127 U.S. military trainers including 35 civilian contractors were present in Georgia. Additionally 1000 troops from the US, and 10 troops from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine each, had participated in the military exercise "Immediate Response 2008" which ended only days earlier. Several of these soldiers were still in the country. The United States European Command, EUCOM, stated that neither participated in the conflict. The Russian side made allegations that at least one American citizen fought with Georgian forces, after producing an American passport claimed to be discovered in Georgian fighting positions. The authenticity of the passport was not contested. However, the passport owner and the US authorities denied the claims, saying the passport was lost elsewhere (apparently, in Moscow).
Russo-South Ossetian and Russo-Abkhaz order of battle.
The Russian order of battle involved significant elements of the Russian 58th Army. According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, 58th Army is one of Russia's premier combat formations and boasts more than twice the number of troops, five times the number of tanks, ten times the number of armoured personnel carriers and twelve times the number of combat aircraft as the entire Georgian Armed Forces.

Equipment losses and cost.
In the aftermath of war Reuters cited some Stratfor analysts who believed that "Russia has largely destroyed Georgia's war-fighting capability". The Georgian Army lost many pieces of heavy equipment, of which a large percentage was left behind during the Georgian Army's retreat from Gori and Poti. Out of its 250-strong tank force, 23 T-72s were either destroyed or captured after the ceasefire agreement. It also lost several units of its advanced air-defense systems, though its arsenal of hand-held anti-aircraft missiles remained largely intact. The Georgian Army also lost hundreds of small arms (mostly AK-74) during the conflict. Three Georgian Navy vessels out of the 19 boat-strong force were sunk in their harbour, Poti, after Russian forces occupied the city, while the rest of the Georgian Navy escaped to Batumi, and a Georgian Coast Guard patrol cutter was sunk by Russian naval forces off the coast of Abkhazia. Nine rigid-hull inflatables were also towed away by the Russians. Russia estimated that the Georgian Air Force lost three out of its nine Su-25 strike aircraft, two of its seven L-29 jet trainers, an AN-2 cargo plane, and four helicopters. Georgian Defence Minister Davit Kezerashvili stated that Georgia suffered losses of materiel worth $250 million. 
Following the war the Georgian Army replaced its losses by purchasing large shipments of foreign military equipment, including tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, firearms, ammunition, military vehicles, missiles, air defense weaponry, and telecommunications equipment, primarily from Ukraine and Turkey. The Georgian Navy partially replaced its losses with patrol/fast attack boats from Turkey, and two of the vessels sunk in Poti harbor were raised and returned to service. All operational naval units were merged with the Georgian Coast Guard. The Georgian Air Force purchased additional unmanned aerial vehicles and two helicopters from Turkey. In August 2010, the Georgian military budget stood at $400 million. The Georgian Armed Forces reached a strength greater than pre-war levels in 2009. With the military reforms completed, Georgia then reduced military spending. In 2010, Georgia also began producing its own line of armored vehicles, small arms, artillery systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
Russia officially confirmed the loss of three Su-25 strike aircraft and one Tu-22M3 supersonic bomber. Analysts at Moscow Defense Brief give a higher estimate, saying that the overall losses of Russian Air Force in the war amounted to seven aircraft, while Anton Lavrov lists 6 Su-25s, 2 Su-24s and 1 Tu-22M as lost.
According to "Nezavisimaya Gazeta", figures from the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, compiled three days after the war in lieu of official data, place the cost of the five days of war at 12.5 billion rubles (then $508.7 million) for Russia. This includes the cost of the losses of four Russian aircraft which is thought to have been more than $44 million. According to the estimate, no less than 1.2 billion rubles (then 50.8 million dollars) per day went on fuel.

Einar Thor

Einar Thor, also known as Einar Þór Gunnlaugsson, (born August 2, 1964) is an Icelandic film director and writer primarily based in London since 1990. He has written and directed various films and videos, made dozens of radio programmes for Icelandic national radio and written articles on art, politics and culture. His filmmaking style has been described by critics as laid back, amusing and minimalistic.
Biography.
Einar Thor grew up on a farm in northwest Iceland, and in his early years became also a part times sailor in the nearby village, Flateyri, where he was also born.
He used to be a year ahead in junior school and left his home ground at the age of 14 for further studies in south Iceland, left school at the age of 17 to work various jobs in fish and farming, but continued his studies again at the age of 19.
At 23 he went as a volunteer to Nicaragua in 1988 during the Contras conflict. He returned to Europe where he graduated from the London Film School with a distinction in directing in 1992. He also studied mass media theory and Spanish at the University of Iceland and at the Universidad de Málaga, Spain, from 1988 to 1990, and later continued his academic studies at City University, London where he completed an MA in Art Management and Policy Making in the arts in 2001.
Career.
Prior to films he took part in number of European conferences on cultural and social issues in Denmark, Germany, France and Spain as a member of the Executive Committee of the Icelandic Youth Council in 1989, and was actively involved in international exchange programs in Europe and Central America in 1988.
During his London years in the early 1990s he received a European council's grant to study in Spain, jury prize for his short film in Antalya, Turkey, nomination for the young film maker of the year award at the Edinburg film festival, and appeared in number of short films and videos as an actor, including the lead in a Soul II Soul music video for UN in 1994.
In late 1990's Einar was critical on how film policy in his country was handled by authorities and in 2001 wrote his MA theses, "Film Policy in Iceland", a study on the state of the film community in Iceland at the time. Among his published articles in the late 1990s were pieces on the work of the Scandinavian writers Ibsen and Strindberg and interview with their English translator Michael Meyer, in addition to the short stories "Dolores" and "Time & Space".
After his latest dramatic work, "Heiðin", aka "Small Mountain" was released (2008), Variety magazine called the film a 'kooky charm' and a critic at the National Radio 2 said he "continues to develop the art of filmmaking in the country", but Einar had previously made the satirical, stage-play-like movie "The Third Name" (2003), that went mostly unnoticed in his country. "Heiðin" was famously condemned for 'sacrificing a lamb for a movie' receiving 'zero stars' by some cinema goers, where as a lamb was convincingly fake-slaughtered in a key scene in the movie. In October 2010 his feature documentary North West was premiered in cinema in Iceland receiving favorable reviews and running for 6 weeks. In addition to North West / 2nd part, it was released on DVD late 2011. The documentary tells the story of a snow avalanche which hit the town he was born in.
Filmography.
"Regina" (1992), short film.
"Rescue Dogs" (1997), documentary for National TV.
"Norð Vestur" / "North West" (2010)

The 象戯図式 "Shōgi Zushiki," 諸象戯図式 "Sho Shōgi Zushiki," and 象棋六種之図式 "Shōgi Rokushu no Zushiki" are Edo-era publications describing various variants of Japanese chess, otherwise known as "shōgi."
The "Shōgi Zushiki" covers the setup and moves of standard "shōgi, chū shōgi, dai shōgi, tenjiku shōgi, dai dai shōgi, maka dai dai shōgi," and "tai shōgi."

Rare breed (agriculture)

A rare breed is defined as a breed of livestock or poultry that is not common in modern agriculture, though it may have been in the past. Various national and international organizations, such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, The Livestock Conservancy in the USA, or the Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the United Kingdom, each define the exact parameters of what defines a rare breed. Many breeds that qualify as rare by these standards may only have a few thousand or even just a few hundred breeding individuals. These organizations pursue conservation of heritage livestock and poultry for their unique traits, which can contribute to genetic diversity among animals important to human food supplies and economies, as well as general biodiversity and improvements in animal husbandry. The parallel of rare animal breeds are heirloom plants, which are rare cultivars.

Rhydwen Williams

Robert Rhydwenfro Williams, known as Rhydwen Williams, (29 August 1916 - 2 August 1997), was a Welsh poet, novelist and Baptist minister. His work is mainly written in his native Welsh language, and is noted for adapting the established style and context of Welsh poetry from a rural and bygone age to that of a modern industrial landscape, while retaining traditional prosody and metre.
Life.
Born in Pentre, Rhondda, in 1916 into a miner's family, Williams spent his childhood in the industrial community of the valley before his family moved to Christleton, Cheshire, in 1931 to escape the economic depression. Williams was very unhappy in England and returned to live in the Rhondda in 1941.
Before his return to Wales, Williams worked mainly in menial jobs, and later studied intermittently at both the University College of Swansea and Bangor. A conscientious objector on Welsh nationalist grounds, he served in a Quaker relief unit during the bombing of Liverpool. Williams was given his first pastorate in 1941 in a Baptist chapel in Ynyshir, where he developed his style of poetry. A controversial figure due to his pacifism and nationalism, he was nevertheless a popular minister, with a wonderful voice, comparable with that of Richard Burton. A gifted reader of poetry, he often read for the Welsh Home Service on the BBC.
As a member of the Cadwgan Circle, he mixed with fellow members J. Gwyn Griffiths, Pennar Davies and Gareth Alban Davies, and was especially close to J. Kitchener Davies. From this informal group of like-minded intellectuals, Williams developed a style of writing and literal ethic opposed to eisteddfodic tradition. Amongst his heroes were writers Aldous Huxley, W H Auden and George Orwell.
Although Williams' poetry was not in keeping with the tradition of the National Eisteddfod, he was still embraced by it. In 1946, at Mountain Ash, he won the Crown competition for the poem "Yr Arloeswr" (The Pioneer) and again in 1964 for "Yr Ffynhonnau" (The Springs)
Leaving Ynyshir in 1946 he travelled Wales, holding pastorates at Resolven and Pont-Ilew in the Swansea Valley until 1959, before spending a year at Rhyl. Williams later moved from his ministry to accept a post at Granada Television in Manchester, presenting Welsh language programmes, in which his skills as a communicator came to the fore. He wrote television scripts; one about Dietrich Bonhoeffer was the first Welsh-language television play to be broadcast on a foreign network. 
Of all Williams' work, his trilogy "Cwm Hiraith" is seen by many as his finest achievement; semi-autobiographical, the three books form a prose epic of life in the depression hit Rhondda through the eyes of the author's Uncle Sion, a poet and thinker. 
During the 1970s, Williams and his family lived in a council house at Coed yr Haf, Ystrad Mynach, where he continued his membership of Plaid Cymru. Williams suffered a stroke in 1981, the physical effects of which he suffered for the rest of his life. Between 1980 and 1985 he edited the current affairs magazine "Barn". He died at Merthyr Tydfil in 1997.

Maggie Holland

Maggie Holland is an English singer and songwriter. She was born and raised in Alton, Hampshire and became involved in the local folk club scene in the late 1960s. She has played in a number of bands and formed a number of collaborations with other artists, but has become well known in recent times as a solo artist and songwriter. She enjoys singing songs with meaningful words and has named her major influences as Bob Dylan, Al Stewart, Dave Evans, Leon Rosselson, Billy Bragg, Bruce Cockburn and Robb Johnson. Several of her own songs have entered the repertoires of notable artists, such as Martin Carthy and June Tabor and, in 2000, Maggie received the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards “Best Song of 1999” for her song "A Place Called England". Colin Irwin wrote of her in fRoots magazine: "The proof that outstanding contemporary songs are still being written”. She now lives in Leith, Scotland.
Career history.
Early collaborations.
Hot Vultures.
Her first work as a professional musician was as bassist and, later, singer in Hot Vultures, alongside Ian A. Anderson. By this time she had moved to Farnham, Surrey. Hot Vultures toured and recorded from 1973 to 1979.
English Country Blues Band.
Hot Vultures became the English Country Blues Band (ECBB) when Holland and Anderson were joined by Rod Stradling and Sue Harris (Sue Harris later being replaced by Chris Coe).
Tiger Moth.
The ECBB expanded to become Tiger Moth, an electric country dance band, which lasted until 1989.
Orchestre Super Moth.
This was a further expansion of the Tiger Moth line-up, including occasional musicians from around the world, and represented a move away from purely English and American traditions to become one of the first "crossover" world music bands. Alongside Holland and the other Tiger Moth members, line-ups have included such respected international musicians as Flaco Jimenez, Dembo Konte, Kausu Kuyateh, Hijaz Mustapha and Abdul Tee-Jay.
Solo career.
From 1980, Holland, whilst continuing as a member of the ECBB and its successor Tiger Moth, began performing occasionally as a solo artist, singing and accompanying herself on guitar or banjo, performing a mix of modern and traditional British and American songs. She released her first solo album, Still Pause, in 1983. She also occasionally performed as a duo with Chris Coe, including a tour of the far east in 1985. Also in 1985 she was the female lead singer in the National Theatre's 3 month run of Tony Harrison’s Mysteries trilogy. Holland moved from Farnham to Oxford in 1986.
Maggie continued to punctuate her solo career with collaborations with other artists whose work she admired.
Songwriting.
In 1987 Holland began to write her first songs, encouraged by Jon Moore, one of her colleagues from Tiger Moth, with whom she had made an EP. Her writing, whilst not prolific, is of great quality, and has met with much critical acclaim.
Some notable Maggie Holland songs.
Perfumes of Arabia.
Maggie Holland wrote this in April 1991 about the Gulf War. It was first published on her 1992 album Down to the Bone. Later in the year Martin Carthy recorded it with Dave Swarbrick for their album Skin and Bone. An earlier live version sung by Martin Carthy on 17 October 1991 at Graffiti's, Pittsburg, was released in 2001 on "The Carthy Chronicles".
A Proper Sort of Gardener.
Credited jointly with Jon Moore, this is a sentimental journey back to her childhood in Alton, the nostalgia tinged with sadness at the changes wrought on small parts of all our lives by "progress".
Sandy Hill.
Composed while she was living in Farnham, this collaboration with Moore focuses on the fact that it is not just inner cities which have their problem areas. Her observational skills are unclouded by the sentiment which she clearly feels.
A Place Called England.
The song which won Maggie an award in the inaugural (2000) BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards was (in her own words) inspired by Christopher Hill's book "The World Turned Upside Down", Leon Rosselson's song of the same name, Naomi Mitchison's "Sea-Green Ribbons", William Cobbett's "Cottage Economy", Hamish Henderson's "Freedom Come-All-Ye", Jean Giono's "The Man Who Planted Trees" and "animated discussions with (rightly) proud and passionate Scots like Dick Gaughan". A Loughborough Folk Festival programme stated: "Maggie Holland is one of the most inspiring singer/songwriters in Britain today. "A Place Called England" has become emblematic in the movement to reclaim a positive sense of English identity."
Recent collaborations.
Maggie's Farm.
With Moore and Kevin Mason she formed Maggie's Farm in 1986. The band's name is a reference to the Bob Dylan song of that name, Dylan being one of Maggie's favourite songwriters. Maggie's Farm toured Bangladesh for the British Council in 1988.
Robb Johnson Band.
In 1989 she began to play bass in Robb Johnson's band. Maggie much admires Johnson's songwriting and has recorded a number of his works.
Derroll's Dream.
During 2010 Maggie participated in a project featuring the music of Derroll Adams, arranged and directed by Wiet Van Der Liest. The ensemble included seven female singers including Maggie who also played 5-string banjo, a thirteen-piece chamber orchestra, guitarist Roland Van Campenhout and Wiet van de Leest on violin. They performed the programme at the Brosella, Gent and Dranouter festivals in 2010.

Game-winning RBI

Major League Baseball kept record of game-winning RBI, or GW RBI, in the years 1980-1988. The game-winning RBI was credited to the batter whose at-bat was responsible for bringing his team ahead for the final time in the game. For example, if a batter on the winning team brought his team ahead 3-2 from a 2-2 tie at some point during the game, his team later led 5-2 as a result of other batters, and then the opposing team scored two more runs before the final score was 5-4, the batter on the winning team who batted in the third run would be credited with the game-winning RBI, even though the losing team scored four runs. The debate over whether the RBI should be credited to the batter who drove in the third run or the batter who drove in the fifth run in such situations led to the statistic being abolished.
ESPN would continue to occasionally show "GW RBI" in their on-screen statistics well into the 1990s.

Klaus Dierks

Klaus Dierks (19 February 1936 in Berlin-Dahlem – 17 March 2005 in Windhoek) was a deputy government minister, a transport planner and civil engineer in Namibia.
Biography.
Dierks was born in 1936 in Berlin-Dahlem, Germany. He studied civil engineering and history at the Berlin Technical University and earned a diploma in Engineering in 1965 and doctorates in 1965 and 1992. Immediately after receiving his diploma, Dierks became an engineer in South Africa before moving to what is now Namibia. 
In 1982 Dierks became a member of resistance movement SWAPO rising to be a member of its Central Committee. He argued for the "Development of the infrastructure regarding the road system in an independent SWA/ Namibia" in 1979 when both the topic of independence and the name "Namibia" were considered revolutionary. In the 1980s he was forced to resign after 22 years of service, and he then set up his own consultative business. It was at this time that Dierks started to write about Namibian history, "pursuing an academic war against the apartheid regime" by outlining the cultural and economic development of the area before the encroachment of European settlers and missionaries, a fact contested by the colonial regime.
At Namibian independence in 1990 he became deputy minister, first with the Works, Transport and Communication portfolio and later in the Ministry for Mines and Energy. He was a member of the National Assembly of Namibia from independence until 2000, when he retired from politics. He was known for his love of history, mountaineering and photography.
Positions.
Later he served with the Namibian Electricity Control Board energy regulator and he managed to turn around TransNamib (the Namibian railway company) from loss to profit in three years.
Publications.
Dierks wrote a number of scientific publications including his doctorate on the development of an improved road system in Namibia and publications on history and the settlement of ǁKhauxaǃnas in the Great Karas Mountains. He also wrote a number of publications in the field of transport and telecommunications.
Family.
Klaus Dierks lived up to his death with his wife Karen von Bremen and his four children in Windhoek.

Ann Packer (author)

Ann Packer (born 1959) is an American novelist and short story writer, perhaps best known for her critically acclaimed first novel "The Dive From Clausen's Pier". She is the recipient of a James Michener Award and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship.
Personal life.
Packer was born in Stanford, California. She is the daughter of Stanford University professors Herbert Packer and Nancy (Huddleston) Packer. 
Her mother was a student of the historian/novelist Wallace Stegner at the Stanford Writing Program; Nancy Packer later joined the Stanford faculty as professor of English and creative writing. Her father was on the faculty of Stanford Law School, where he highlighted the tensions between Due Process and Crime Control. In 1969, when Ann was 10 years old, he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. He committed suicide three years later.
Her uncle, George Huddleston, Jr., and her grandfather, George Huddleston, Sr., were congressmen from Alabama. Her brother, George Packer, is a novelist, journalist, and playwright. Her father was Jewish and her mother was from a Christian background.
Packer currently lives in Northern California with her two children.
Career.
Packer was an English major at Yale University, but only began writing fiction during her senior year. She moved to New York after college and took a job writing paperback cover copy at Ballantine Books. She attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop from 1986 to 1988, selling her first short story to "The New Yorker" a few weeks before receiving her M.F.A. degree.
In 1988 Packer moved to Madison, Wisconsin as a fellow at the Wisconsin Institute for Creative Writing. During her two years in Wisconsin she published stories in literary magazines, including the story "Babies", which was included in the 1992 O. Henry Award prize stories collection. The "New Yorker" story, "Mendocino", became the title story of her first book, "Mendocino and Other Stories", published by Chronicle Books in 1994.
Packer spent almost 10 years writing "The Dive From Clausen's Pier". Geri Thoma of the Elaine Markson Agency agreed to take on the book and sold it almost immediately to the editor Jordan Pavlin at Alfred A. Knopf. It was the first selection of the "Good Morning America" “Read This!” book club and received a Great Lakes Book Award, an American Library Association Award, and the Kate Chopin Literary Award. Ann’s second novel, "Songs Without Words", is also published by Knopf. In addition to fiction, Packer has written essays for "Vogue" and "Real Simple" magazines.
"The Dive from Clausen's Pier" was adapted into a cable television film, which was not well received by fans of the novel. Among its difficulties were making the characters much younger than they were in the novel.

Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour

The Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour is a 2008–2009 promotional concert tour of music co-written by David Byrne and Brian Eno with performances by Byrne. In addition to being a retrospective of the duo's collaborations, the tour promoted the album "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today".
Material.
Byrne assembled a band to tour for the album, performing music throughout the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 across North America, Europe, and Australasia. He hired more singers than he had on previous tours to reproduce the complex vocal harmonies of the album and was inspired to bring along dancers after seeing Sufjan Stevens promote the album "Illinois" as well as the Japanese films "Funky Forest" and "The Taste of Tea". Byrne was initially uninvolved in the choreography, but made more suggestions as the tour went on and after he saw a live performance by Deerhoof that incorporated dancing with instruments. He began booking tour dates before the album was completed and continued writing his book "The Bicycle Diaries" throughout the tour.
In planning the set lists for the tour, Byrne initially considered only promoting this album, but decided to assemble songs this album as well as their previous collaborations, including the Talking Heads albums "More Songs About Buildings and Food", "Fear of Music", and "Remain in Light" and Byrne's "The Catherine Wheel" soundtrack. By playing music from all of their collaborations, Byrne hoped to "draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30 years ago" with the goal of clarifying the connection between all of the duo's previous work. In reviewing the music, he found that "here might be more continuity than I imagined, which I hope is going to work in my favor." Although he was invited to participate and early reports indicated that would, Eno chose to not tour, letting Byrne decide how to present this music live.
A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation, claiming "I sense that a lot of people don't know we have a record out" and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with this tour. At the same time, the main goal of the performance was not promotion but the show itself.
Set lists.
The set list for the first night:
By the time he reached St. Louis in mid-October, the following set was played:
Mid-way through this leg, Byrne expanded some shows to have three encores, such as Omaha, Indianapolis, Toronto, and Raleigh. The first was as listed above, the second was "Don't Worry About the Government" and "Burning Down the House", and the third was "Everything That Happens". He also played this extended encore at the Hong Kong and Sydney shows. Byrne expanded his February 28, 2009, show to contain four two-song encores.
Musicians and technical personnel.
Performers.
[[File:Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour performers.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Performers from the Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour on the opening night—September 16, 2008—at the Zoellner Arts Center - Baker Hall in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. (Left to right):
Back: Refosco, Hawthorne, and De Gli Antoni
Middle: Kaïssa, R. Frazier, Muldaur and P. Frazier
Front: Reker, Byrne, Kuhn, and Baldwin]]
Byrne has assembled the following musicians and dancers to accompany him:
Refosco previously toured with Byrne's My Backwards Life band in support of "Grown Backwards"; he also appears on "Look into the Eyeball", "Grown Backwards", "Live from Austin, Texas", and "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today" playing percussion. The performers started rehearsals the day that the album was released and continued to rehearse more for this tour than is typical for other Byrne presentations. All performers dress alike in cream-colored jumpsuits and overalls. The dancers have choreographed for seven songs and the entire ensemble performed together for the first time on September 9.
Technical crew.
The equipment was engineered by Clair Global and included gear from Lab.gruppen, TC Electronic, and Yamaha.
Supporting acts.
There were only a handful of dates that included other performers and no opening act was scheduled throughout the tour. Ani DiFranco opened on June 2, 2009, and Byrne played a double bill with Marianne Faithfull opening on July 30, 2009. The Extra Action Marching Band guested on "Burning Down the House" and "Road to Nowhere" on the October 7, 2008, and June 23, 24, and 26, 2009, dates. DeVotchka opened on some 2009 dates.
Tour dates.
The tour was expected to run six months into spring 2009, including dates in Australia and Europe before finally concluding after 11 months with five legs worldwide:
First leg – North America, fall 2008.
†Date scheduled and later canceled
"Everything That Happens Will Happen on This Tour".
Everything That Happens Will Happen on This Tour – David Byrne on Tour: Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno is a 2009 live EP released by David Byrne recorded during the Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour. The album is composed of live recordings of three songs from the 2009 Byrne/Eno collaboration "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today" and one—"Help Me Somebody"—from their 1981 album "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts".
Recording and release.
Byrne was approached by Amnesty International to get involved in his tour. For years, Byrne had performed one date on his tours as a benefit and decided to record this EP with proceeds from sales benefiting the organization.
Byrne's band performed with an audio system that could professionally record every show based around Pro Tools. Byrne had these recordings mixed by Patrick Dillett—who was also responsible for engineering on "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today".
The album was made available digitally in the form of DRM-free 320 kbit/s MP3s with the option of a FLAC as well. Like "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today", the EP was marketed with Internet startup Topspin Media.
The album received a positive review from "The Village Voice", calling it "cheerful" and "lovely."
Track listing.
All songs written by David Byrne and Brian Eno; "Strange Overtones" co-written by Leo Abrahams.
"Ride, Rise, Roar".
On February 11, 2010, it was announced that a documentary film entitled "Ride, Rise, Roar" chronicling the tour would be released to the 2010 film festival circuit. The debut with be at South by Southwest on March 15, 2010, where it will be screened in all three media categories—film, interactive, and music. The film was the feature-length directorial debut by Hillman Curtis—who also worked on the short film that accompanies the deluxe edition of "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today". The film includes concert footage, footage of the planning and rehearsals for the tour, and exclusive interviews with Byrne, Eno, and the supporting musicians and dancers. Curtis was initially contacted to document the tour with no clear objective for the film and decided to focus on the collaboration between Byrne and his tour mates as well as the unique challenge of combining popular music with modern dance.

Bateman is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Western Australia.
The district shares its name with the southern Perth suburb of Bateman, situated in the central part of the electorate. Both the electorate and the suburb are named after members of the Bateman family who established their home ‘Grasmere’ at nearby Bulls Creek in 1886. The seat was created as a result of the 2007 electoral redistribution, largely replacing the former Murdoch electorate. Bateman is regarded as a safe Liberal seat, as Murdoch (itself largely replaced by Jandakot between 1989 and 1996) had been held by the party since the seat's creation in 1977.

Less widely known than the margarita, its structure is similarly simple, with three primary ingredients: silver or "blanco" tequila, pineapple juice, and lime juice. Its chief coupling of pineapple and a single spirit resembles a Jackhammer, a variant of the Screwdriver which substitutes pineapple juice for orange juice to mix with vodka. Matadors are often presented differently, either in a cocktail (or martini) glass or a champagne flute.
Background.
The cocktail combines three Mexican exports: tequila, pineapple and lime. Due to typically high natural sugar content in many pineapple varieties, or use of sweetened commercially produced pineapple juice, additional sweeteners are not usually added.
In addition to these details, Matador is a commercial brand of tequila, though usage of a specifically branded spirit here is variable, similar to ingredient usage in other cocktails.

Panel call indicator

Panel Call Indicator, or PCI, is a form of signalling used between two telephone offices.
PCI was designed along with the panel type of telephone office. The original purpose of PCI was to allow panel subscribers to dial numbers in manual offices the same way they dialed numbers in panel offices.
For PCI to achieve its purpose, the panel office sent the dialed number to a lit display (call indicator) in the manual office. The operator read the number from the call indicator and completed the call in the usual way. 
In the British Director telephone system, the Coded-Call Indicator (CCI) was similar, as it displayed dialled telephone numbers at the local manual exchange in a mixed (automatic and manual) linked-number area. 
What is sent.
The usual seven-digit US telephone number consists of a three-digit office code and a four-digit line number within the given office. After a caller in a panel office dialed the office code, the sender looked up the type of the called office (panel, manual, etc.) and whether PCI was to be used. Then the sender found a trunk to the called office. Once a trunk had been found and the decision to use PCI had been made, the office code was not needed. So only the line number was sent to the manual office.
However, for two reasons, PCI always sends five-digit line numbers rather than four (and the caller may need to dial eight digits rather than seven).
The panel system was designed to work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. Callers dialed the office code followed by the line number within the office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore dialed the office code and a five-digit line number. For offices with fewer than 10,000 lines, callers dialed four digits but PCI sends a leading 0.
Also, when the panel office was designed, many people used party lines. Party line numbers were listed with a J, M, R, or W following the line number. The caller dialed the office code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. Party letters replace the ten-thousands digit described above. That is, PCI sends the letter followed by the four-digit line number. So party letters and line numbers above 10,000 can't be used together.
Encoding.
Digits are sent in order from most to least significant. The party letter is sent first, since it replaces the ten-thousands digit.
Generally, each digit is sent as a group of four bits having the place values 1, 2, 4, and 5. This could be considered a form of biquinary code. The thousands digit is sent using binary-coded decimal, but with the 1 bit moved to the end of the group. Except for the 1 bit in the thousands digit, all bits are sent in order from least to most significant. An entire transmission uses twenty bits.
Looking at the transmission another way, it consists of twenty "time slots" which may be filled by DC pulses. The first and third pulse times in a group of four contain either a positive DC current or no current. The second and fourth pulse times in a group of four contain either a light (high resistance) negative DC pulse or a heavy (low resistance) negative DC pulse. The pattern of current flow (positive, negative, positive, negative) keeps the receiver synchronized with the sender. This pattern never varies so it contains no information. The existence of a current (in the first and third pulse times) or the resistance of the current (in the second and fourth times) carries the information.
In this table, + represents a positive pulse, – represents a light negative pulse, and = represents a heavy negative pulse.
Note that the codes for the stations digits or letters 0, 1, W, R, J, and M are the same as the codes for the hundreds/tens/units digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

<doc id="18762953" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18762953" title="Election of Christian III">
Election of Christian III

The election of Christian III as king of Denmark and Norway on 4 July 1534 was a landmark event for all of Denmark and Norway. It took place in the church in the town of Rye, eastern Jutland, where the Jutlandic nobility elected Prince Christian, son of King Frederick I and Duke of Slesvig and Holsten, as king. This brought about the Count's Feud ("Grevens Fejde") and later also led to the implementation of the Protestant Reformation in Denmark and Norway. 
Christian was a zealous Protestant who had witnessed the defence of Martin Luther at the Diet of Worms, and he had already carried out the Reformation in the Duchies of Slesvig and Holsten. Christian's views made it difficult to gain the support of a majority of the Council of the Realm as most noblemen and, of course, the bishops would rather see a Roman Catholic king on the throne and hence preferred his younger brother. 
Among the supporters of Christian were Mogens Gøye, Steward of the Realm. Mogens Gøye was a Danish statesman and the Royal councillor of several Danish Kings. Gøye was among the originators of the meeting in Rye Church between eight Jutlandic members of the Council and the four Jutlandic bishops. 
Members of the lesser nobility had also turned up – presumably on Mogens Gøye's initiative – but had to stay outside the church. The lengthy discussion about the election eventually made them lose patience, and they forced their way into the church and demanded to know who opposed the election of Prince Christian. After that, the opponents finally gave up. Bishop Bille of Aarhus wept when he signed the request for the Protestant Duke to become king, realising that it would mean his own downfall. 
Although hesitant, Christian accepted the election and was cheered at a meeting in Horsens on 18 August 1534 where he declared that he would, like his predecessors, sign a "håndfæstning" (charter), although with a reform of ecclesiastical affairs, i.e. the implementation of the Protestant Reformation in Denmark and Norway.

Zubo

Zubo is a rhythm action video game developed by EA Bright Light Studios for the Nintendo DS. It was released on October 3, 2008 in Europe, October 21, 2008 in Australia, January 22, 2009 in Japan and March 10, 2009 in North America.
Plot.
"Zubo" is set in the world of Zubalon, which is inhabited by a race called the Zubos. Zubalon is under siege by Big Head and his army of fake Zubo clones, named Zombos. But first, "you must fight other heads Big Head sent in order to gain access to Big Head."
Gameplay.
All actions, including movement, selection, and battles, are performed with the stylus and touch screen. In "Zubo", players can befriend up to 55 different types of Zubos they meet while travelling in Zubalon, feed and nurture them, help them gain skills and strength, and assist them in chasing off Zombos. Each Zubo is one of 3 types which allows a fully flexible team that you can use to your own advantage in strategic battles with rhythm action mechanics, where the player attacks by tapping or sliding the stylus on the Nintendo DS's touchscreen; different Zubo types are stronger or weaker at attacking others. The game is divided into several themed worlds, each with a team of Zubos which the player can add to their team. Once you progress further into the game, you will have zubo's with higher life and more damage.
Note: Once you have defeated the final boss, you can find you can teleport anywhere. But that doesn't mean everywhere.
Reception.
Zubo received good reviews in the neighborhood of 85%. Critics complimented its charming presentation and new combat system, recommending it for children, while criticizing its lack of storyline, a serious flaw in a RPG, and lack of objectives.

Miles Field

Miles Field was a baseball stadium in Medford, Oregon, that played host to high school, American Legion and professional minor league baseball from 1948 to 2004. The pro teams that played at this facility included the Medford Nuggets/Rogues of the Far West League in 1948-1951 and three Northwest League teams, the Medford Giants from 1967 to 1968, the Rogue Valley Dodgers from 1969 to 1971, the Medford/Southern Oregon A's/Southern Oregon Timberjacks franchise from 1979 to 1999. It was previously known as Jackson & Perkins Gardens at Miles Field during the mid to late 1990s because of the ballpark's relationship with Bear Creek Corporation, now the Harry & David Corporation.
History.
In 1951, former player Claude "Shorty" Miles worked behind the scenes to help get a new baseball park built in Medford because of his unbridaled passion for the sport. A suspicious fire destroyed the structure, but it was quickly rebuilt. The stadium was originally known as the Jackson County Baseball Park when it first opened. Eight months after Shorty Miles died in 1968, Jackson County Baseball Park was rededicated as Miles Field.
Demise of the stadium.
In 1999, the Timberjacks left Medford and relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, leaving the city without a pro baseball franchise. After many years of the field's continued use by high school and American Legion teams, and despite efforts to both raise funds to remodel the stadium and to bring in a new team to play there, it was torn down in 2004 to make way for a controversial new Wal-Mart Super Center that opened in 2012. Two years later, Harry & David Field was constructed just down the street from the old Miles Field site. Under an agreement between the venue and the city of Medford, that field was built to accommodate youth baseball, high school baseball and American Legion baseball, but "not" a professional team.
The Miles Field site remained empty and unoccupied due to the legal battle over the site which involved the Medford City Council, Wal-Mart and the Medford Citizens for Responsible Development. On June 4, 2009, the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals ruled to block the project temporarily until a traffic study is prepared. The city council appealed that ruling soonafter. However, despite the MCRD's best efforts to block construction, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Walmart on November 18, 2010 and the new Supercenter got the go-ahead to be built. The court overturned a decision by the state's Land Use Board of Appeals to do a traffic study. Construction started on the new Walmart in early 2012 and was completed in the summer of 2012.

El Mundo del Profesor Rossa (Spanish for The World of Professor Rossa) was a Chilean children's television show centering on a professor named "Professor Rossa", who taught about Chilean national animals and nature. The show was broadcast on UCV TV from 1981 to 1984 and on Canal 13 from 1984 to 2001.
The show.
The show was set in Professor Rossa's house. The first seasons, the program only starred the professor and piano composer Valentín Trujillo. Guru Guru appeared later, as a man in bird disguise who delivered the children's letters to the professor, the bird started to have a "father-son" relationship with the professor, so Guru Guru left the postman role. Don Carter came to fill the role and the show was expanded to four characters.
The four characters interacted inside the house always doing a mess, irritating the professor to bring humor to the program. In some seasons, the professor moved the show from his living room to an underground room connected by a secret passage, leaving the first set.
The professor had videos about animals and nature in Betacam format, and to watch it, the character must put the tape in front of his eyes.
Awards.
The show received, in both 1986 and 1988, the "Best Children Program" Award by the Chilean CNTV.
El Video Prohibido,The Forbidden Video.
A video appeared on the Internet called ""El Video Prohibido del Profesor Rosa"" (Spanish for ""The Forbidden Video of Professor Rossa"") where the four characters were seen saying vulgarities,referencing alcoholic beverages, mocking each other, and one of the shots where the professor is seen urinating on top of Lonquimay volcano while he argues with Guru Guru (one of the characters). Even though the press said that the show was canceled after the leak of this video; the actual reason the show was canceled was the high cost of production.

Montana in the American Civil War

Montana played little direct role in the American Civil War. The closest the Confederate States Army ever came to Montana was New Mexico and eastern Kansas, each over a thousand miles away. Montana was not even an organized territory until Montana Territory was created on May 26, 1864, three years after the Battle of Fort Sumter; in 1861, it was divided between the Dakota Territory and the Washington Territory, and in 1863, it was part of the Idaho Territory. 
Nevertheless, Confederate soldiers did have a presence in what is now the U.S. state of Montana. Those in the Montana Territory who supported the Confederate side were varied. Among them were Confederate soldiers who were determined that some of Montana's gold would go into the Southern instead of Northern coffers. But most were those who would rather not fight in the war, which ranged from pure drifters to actual Confederate deserters.
In southwest Montana, Madison County residents of the area native to the Southeast United States wished to name their new town Varina, in honor of Varina Davis, the wife of the Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The Varina Townsite Company, on June 16, 1863, went to confirm the of land as the town of Varina. However, when they applied for the name, the judge—Connecticut native Dr. G.G. Bissell—refused, saying they would be "damned" before he would allow the town to be named for the first lady of the Confederacy. Bissell did say he would allow the company to name the town after the state of Virginia, and they did so, incorporating the town of Virginia City. Charles Dickens even mentioned it in his book "All the Year Round". The town would remain sympathetic to the South, even after being named the capital of Montana. When boats sailed down the Yellowstone River from the town (this is manifestly wrong, since the Yellowstone River does not even penetrate Madison County, much less flow through Virginia City), the local newspaper said they were sailing to "America."
The loyalty towards the Confederacy concerned many supporters of the Union. Seeing this, Sidney Edgerton in 1863 went quickly to see Abraham Lincoln about the situation, and this was one impetus to create the Montana Territory so quickly.
Gold mining in Montana began during the Civil War; gold placer deposits were discovered at Bannack in 1862. The resulting gold rush resulted in more placer discoveries, including those at Virginia City in 1863 and at Helena and Butte in 1864. Gold from the Montana gold mines went to both sides of the conflict. In Broadwater County, in the central portion of the state, Confederate soldiers found a vein of gold eight miles (13 km) west of Townsend, with the immediate area named "Confederate Gulch" in their honor. It was said to be among the "largest and richest of the placer diggings" within the state.

Lý Huệ Tông

Lý Huệ Tông (chữ Hán 李惠宗; born Lý Sảm; 1194 – 1226) was the king of Vietnam from 1211 to 1224, the penultimate leader of the Lý Dynasty. During Lý Huệ Tông's rule, many members of the Trần family assumed key roles in the government, including Trần Thủ Độ. The Trần family later used its position of power to place a young Trần Cảnh (temple name Trần Thái Tông) on the throne to found the Trần Dynasty.
Biography.
In 1224, Lý Huệ Tông became mentally ill and the issue of succession became pressing. He had produced no male heirs, and so appointed his seven-year-old daughter Lý Chiêu Hoàng as his successor. Although a female ruler would likely not have been normally acceptable to the court, Trần Thủ Độ had a scheme to end the Lý Dynasty and place a Trần on the throne which depended on the existence of a young empress, and so Lý Chiêu Hoàng was accepted as empress. Lý Huệ Tông retired to become a Buddhist monk, although he lived only two more years. In 1226 Trần Thủ Độ, while consolidating power of the newly founded Trần Dynasty by eliminating Lý family members and potential pretenders, induced Lý Huệ Tông to commit suicide.
