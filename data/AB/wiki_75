Ufford Bridge railway station

Ufford Bridge railway station was a station serving the villages of Ufford and Southorpe in Cambridgeshire. The station was situated where the road from Ufford crosses the railway, at the point where it meets the Barnack to Southorpe road.
The platform was under and to the north of the bridge and the goods siding to the south. A waiting room was built utilising the road bridge as its roof. This station when opened has the smallest station platform at 166 ft, (station as opposed to halt) in the country. The train guard combined the duties of station master, porter, booking clerk and ticket collector at Ufford Bridge.
The station was on the Great Northern Railway's Stamford to Wansford line which never really recovered from the 1926 general strike, and the whole line closed in 1929.

Stefan Jagodziński

Stefan Jagodziński lived in Stary Korczyn near Kraków during the Nazi German occupation of Poland in World War II. He worked for the Polish underground and was wanted by the Gestapo. Jagodziński was recognized as the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Jerusalem in 1986, for rescuing a Jewish family from the Holocaust.
In late 1942, through his underground contacts Jagodziński came to the aid of Dr. Bronislaw Tenenwurzel's family interned in the Miechów Ghetto near Kraków. Earlier, Tenenwurzels sent their 14-year-old son to a Cistercian monastery in the nearby village of Mogiła. The boy disliked it, and ran away. A Polish friend sent him to stay with Stefan Jagodziński instead, both under assumed names. Together they became active in the Underground. Soon the boy's Jewish identity became publicly known and so, under a new threat they moved to Kraków, from where, thanks to Jagodziński’s contacts, Emanuel was smuggled to Hungary. He lived there until liberation in early 1945. Meanwhile, Stefan Jagodziński aided Tenenwurzel’s mother and sister with forged “Aryan” papers upon their escape from the Miechów ghetto. Their father was killed in the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp.
In the following decades Emanuel Tenenwurzel remained in contact with his wartime savior while living in the United States. Thanks to his efforts, on July 24, 1986, Yad Vashem recognized Stefan Jagodziński as the Righteous Among the Nations.

Ohr-O'Keefe Museum Of Art

The Ohr-O'Keefe Museum Of Art is a non-profit art museum located in Biloxi, Mississippi, dedicated to the ceramics of George E. Ohr, the self-proclaimed "Mad Potter of Biloxi". The museum is named for ceramic artist George E. Ohr (1857–1918), as well as Annette O'Keefe, late wife of former Biloxi mayor Jeremiah O'Keefe, Sr., who was instrumental in donating money and raising funds for the completion of the museum campus.
The five-building museum campus was designed by architect Frank Gehry to "dance" with the ancient live oak trees on the 4-acre (1.6-hectare) site.
Construction of museum buildings began in 2004. In August 2005, the museum was damaged during Hurricane Katrina, but construction continued.
On November 8, 2010, three buildings on the east side of the campus opened with outstanding exhibitions, including George Ohr pottery from Gulf Coast collections. The Mississippi Sound Welcome Center, the IP Casino Resort & Spa Exhibitions Gallery, and the Gallery of African American Art are open, in addition to the Pleasant Reed Interpretive Center. The City of Biloxi Center for Ceramics opened in September 2012. The John S. and James L. Knight Gallery, which will house the George Ohr pottery, is scheduled for completion in 2014. 
The museum schedules pottery classes within the Center for Ceramics, which houses a state of the art ceramics studio and classrooms. In addition, the Ohr-O'Keefe Museum of Art is continuing its community and school outreach programs, to include the OOMA-Ed program for kids and adults. Summer youth programs (SOOMA) are also held in the Center for Ceramics. 
In July 2011, less than a year after it opened, the Ohr-O'Keefe Museum was facing financial difficulties because revenues were not sufficient to cover operating costs. In October 2011, the Biloxi City Council agreed to provide financial support for the museum, which is housed in city-owned buildings, with an expectation that the museum would grow into a center for cultural tourism.

Who Knows Who

"Who Knows Who" is a collaboration song by English alternative rock band Muse and English hip hop artist Mike Skinner. Not originally intended for official release, an early version of the song leaked onto several Muse internet forums in August 2008. The song was officially released as the B-side to the 7" vinyl edition of the single "Uprising" on 7 September 2009. The lyrics were written by Skinner and the music was written by Muse's Matthew Bellamy.
Background.
The first link between Muse and The Streets was created when Muse bassist Christopher Wolstenholme broke his wrist playing football shortly before the 2004 V Festival and had to be replaced by then-Streets bassist Morgan Nicholls, who still contributes backing vocals, keyboards and synthesizers for Muse's live performances. The two acts first shared a stage at the 2006 Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26 and 27 August, when Muse headlined the main stages. They also both played at the 2007 Big Day Out festival, before Muse chose The Streets to play at the first of their two sell out performances at Wembley Stadium on 16 June 2007. In 2008, Muse announced that they were planning a collaboration with Mike Skinner with the aim of creating "England's answer to Rage Against the Machine". Frontman Matthew Bellamy summed up his ambitions as "London rap-rock, just like a little one off. It might be a laugh!"
Release and reception.
Leak.
On 2 August, a low-posting member by the name of "dopemc" uploaded an mp3 file entitled "Muse And The Streets - Who Knows Who" on the popular fan forum Muselive. After much debate and discussion among fans, Muse released an official note on their website explaining that "The MP3 floating around on the message boards at the moment is a track we recorded with Mike Skinner a few months ago. The track was the result of a late night jam session and something we did for a bit of a laugh featuring a blues riff we have been playing live recently (similar to "Heartbreaker" by Led Zeppelin) upon which Skinner recorded some vocals. It is not intended to be a serious release so we are happy for it to be leaked around unofficially. Hope you enjoy, Cheers. Matt, Dom & Chris." 
Skinner has since downplayed the quality of the song, saying "We did the track and it felt really genuine, but a bit of a laugh as well. Then the label started getting too excited by it, so I fucked it off. I didn't really think it was that good." Despite this, he rapped a part of the song during his performance at the BBC Electric Proms on 23 October.
Official release.
"Who Knows Who" was officially released as the B-side to the 7" vinyl single "Uprising" in September 2009, just over a year after the original leak.

The following year, although still a junior, he opted to participate in the open class of the European Championships in 10 metre air pistol and helped the Russian team to a gold medal and a new world record, also breaking the junior world record in the qualification round. He then proceeded to defeat teammates Mikhail Nestruyev and Vladimir Isakov in the final, to top a Russian triple victory and win his first international senior title. He defended this gold medal the next year after a qualification score of 591 points, two points below the world record.
Yekimov made his Olympic debut in the air pistol competition in Beijing in 2008, and finished sixth. He was also chosen as Sergei Alifirenko's replacement in the rapid fire pistol competition, when Alifirenko, who won gold in Sydney and bronze in Athens, had to withdraw.

South African cricket team in Australia in 2008–09

The South Africa cricket team toured Australia between 6 December 2008 and 30 January 2009, playing three Test matches, two Twenty20 Internationals and five One Day Internationals against Australia.
Following a dispute with Cricket Australia, the three leading news agencies, Reuters, Agence France-Presse and Associated Press decided not to cover the series.
Build-up.
The South African players and media were buoyant ahead the tour, citing their telling Test form and Australia's coincident decline. Proteas captain Graeme Smith saw it as his team's best chance to win a Test rubber Down Under: the bowling attack was globally vaunted, the fielding polished and the batsmen enjoying a particularly fecund run, Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla and Smith himself all having passed 1,000 Test runs for the year, while Ashwell Prince and AB de Villiers hovered around the 900 mark.
Australia, on the other hand, was still reeling from its two-nil Test defeat in India, although a clinical display against the touring New Zealanders assuaged some of their apprehensions: most notably, wicketkeeper Brad Haddin's sizeable hundred against New Zealand for once made seamless the void left by Adam Gilchrist's retirement.
The press duly built the series up as a must-see, but the players were far more reticent than they had been during the adjacent encounter three years before. Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. "It has taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to get us to that number-one spot", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. "If South Africa beat us three-nil I don't know if that gives them enough points to get over us. But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't think that would mean that they deserve to take over that mantle. It's a bit the same with India last series. Just because they beat us, the number-one team, doesn't necessarily mean they go from the number four or number five in the world to number one in the world, because it's something that's accrued over a long period of time." The remark was seen as fatalist and trivialising, suggesting that the rubber hardly mattered and, in the eyes of many, that Ponting's hopes of securing a series victory were low.
South African allround kingpin Jacques Kallis arrived in Australia on the back of one of the worst batting troughs of his career. A little over a week before the First Test, journalist Robert Houwing observed that many of his countrymen had "been ripping the proverbial fox to shreds: almost surreally, Kallis is the hound labouring at the rear of the pack. He shows just 519 runs from 13 Tests and 20 innings this year, at 28.83."
Squads.
Following injuries to Watson, Symonds, Clark, Krejza and Lee, Australia drafted in McDonald, Hilfenhaus, Bollinger and Hauritz.
Test series.
First Test.
Team selections: Shane Watson was named 12th man for Australia. South Africa's Ashwell Prince withdrew from the First Test team after suffering a broken thumb while batting in the nets. JP Duminy was chosen to replace Prince to make his Test debut.
Day 1: Australia won the toss and elected to bat.<br>
After a brief flurry of boundaries from Matthew Hayden, South Africa took three quick wickets - Hayden (12), Ponting (0, first ball) and Hussey (0) - to have Australia 15-3. Simon Katich (83) and Michael Clarke (62) then combined for a 4th-wicket partnership of 149 before both batsmen were out in the two overs before tea, leaving the home side at 166-5. After tea Andrew Symonds and Brad Haddin pushed the run rate up towards 5 per over before Symonds was dismissed for 57, off 68 balls. Haddin (46) and Brett Lee (29) scored at a steady rate, and the day ended with Mitchell Johnson being out off the last ball of the day for 18. Jason Krejza remained 19 not out and Australia finished the day at 341-9.<br>
South Africa took a while to get used to the pitch before Makhaya Ntini took two wickets and Dale Steyn one within five overs in the morning session. The pitch settled down after lunch and only persistent bowling and poor shot selection produced the bulk of the wickets. Ntini finished with 3-66, Steyn 2-72, Morné Morkel 1-62, and Paul Harris 2-70.
Reports considered that honours were relatively even at the end of day one.
Day 2: Australia's tenth wicket partnership put on 34 runs, and the team ended on 375. Morkel took the last wicket to finish with figures of 2-80.<br>
South Africa lost McKenzie for 2, but then consolidated until Amla (47) and Smith (48) fell close together and the score was 110-3. Kallis (63) and de Villiers (63) seemed to be in total control, and took the score to 234 without further loss. Mitchell Johnson then took 5 wickets for 2 runs in 21 deliveries with the old ball to have South Africa 243-8 at stumps. Johnson finished the day with 7-42. Krejza was the only other wicket-taker with figures of 1-102.
Day 3: South Africa's last two wickets put on 38 runs to end at 281, with Johnson and Siddle taking one each. Johnson finished the innings with 8-61, the 8th best bowling figures in Australian Test cricket history. He might have taken nine, and the best figures ever, except that a skied top edge from Boucher (26) fell between Haddin and Lee in a mix-up between the fielders. Other wicket-takers: Siddle 1-44, and Krejza 1-102. Australia had a lead of 94 runs on the first innings.<br>
Australia lost wickets regularly to reach 88-4. Katich (37) and Ponting (32) both got starts but were dismissed by determined bowling. A 60-run partnership between Clarke (25) and Symonds (37) was followed by three quick wickets. At 162-7 the match was evenly poised. Haddin (39*) and Krejza (28*) then added 66 runs to end the day with Australia at 228-7, and a lead of 322.<br>
South African wicket-takers: Kallis 2-19, Steyn 2-57, Harris 2-64, Ntini 1-55.
The highest total achieved in the fourth innings for a win on this ground is 342-8 by Australia against India in 1977-78.
Day 4: Australia's tail wagged for the second time in the match (putting on 162 runs for the last 4 wickets). Haddin (94), Krejza (32) and Johnson (21) all contributing runs and Siddle being at the crease for 37 minutes for his 4*. Haddin was the last out attempting to hit a six to reach his century, but was stumped by Boucher off Harris. Australia's total of 319 gave it a lead of 413.<br>
South African wicket-takers: Kallis 3-24, Harris 3-85, Steyn 2-81, Morkel 1-42, Ntini 1-76.
South Africa started its run-chase slowly with McKenzie taking 52 deliveries to make his 10. Amla's arrival changed all that and he and Smith put on 153 for the second wicket in good time before Smith was out for 108 - his first score above 50 against Australia. Amla (53) was out shortly thereafter and the score was 179-3. Kallis (33*) and de Villiers (11*) saw the visitors through to stumps at 227-3.<br>
Australian wicket-takers: Lee 1-40, Johnson 2-56.
Day 5: Requiring 187 runs to win with a full day's play available, South Africa achieved the second highest successful run chase in Test cricket history, losing only the wicket of Kallis (57) on their way to 414-4. AB de Villiers (106*) and debutant JP Duminy (50*) put on 111 for the fifth wicket to take the visitors to victory.
Australia had a poor day in the field, taking only one wicket. Johnson 3-98 finished with 11 wickets for the match, while Lee was the only other wicket-taker with 1-73.
Second Test.
Team selections: Despite an injured knee Andrew Symonds was preferred to Shane Watson, who again was named 12th man. Australia also replaced Jason Krejza with Nathan Hauritz. South Africa named an unchanged side, after Ashwell Prince failed a fitness test on his cracked left thumb.
Day One: Australia won the toss and elected to bat.<br>
Hayden (8) fell early before Katich (54) and Ponting (101) put on a 107-run partnership for the second wicket. Hussey went for his second duck in three innings before Symonds (27) and Haddin (40) got starts but didn't go on with it. Australia ended the day on 280-6, with Clarke (36*) and Lee (0*) at the crease. The Australian highlight of the day was Ponting's 37th Test century in front of a crowd of 63,263.<br>
South African wicket-takers: Steyn 2-61, Ntini 2-71, Harris 1-33, and Morkel 1-67.
Day Two: Michael Clarke (88*) and the tail added a further 114 runs and Australia ended its first innings on 394.<br>
South African wicket-takers: Steyn 5-87, Ntini 2-108, Harris 1-38, Kallis 1-55 and Morkel 1-89.<br>
South Africa stated slowly and reached 141-6 when Boucher was dismissed. Smith continued his run of form with 62. Duminy (34*) and Morkel (21) helped the score to 198-7 at the close.<br>
Australian wicket-takers: Siddle 3-24, Hauritz 2-49, and Johnson 2-53.
Day Three: In a remarkable day's play South Africa reached 459 all out, after Duminy (166) and Steyn (76) put on 180 for the ninth wicket - the third highest all-time. Brett Lee didn't take the field all day due to a stress fracture in his foot, and Australia was left with three front-line bowlers and their part-timers.<br>
Australian wicket-takers: Siddle 4-81, Hauritz 3-98, Johnson 2-127, and Hussey 1-22.<br>
Australia faced only 3 overs at the end of the day and finished on 4-0.
Day Four: Only captain Ricky Ponting (99) and bowler Mitchell Johnson (43*) withstood the South Africa bowling as Australia was dismissed for 247 in their second innings. Ponting just missed out on a second century for the match which would have made him the only player to have done so four times. Steyn took five wickets to finish with ten for the match.<br>
South African wicket-takers: Steyn 5-67, Morkel 2-46, Kallis 2-57, and Ntini 1-26.<br>
South Africa were set 183 to win the match. At the close of play South Africa were 30-0.
Day Five: Losing only captain Graeme Smith for 75, South Africa reached their victory target in 48 overs. This gave them a 2-0 lead in the series and their first ever Test series win in Australia.<br>
Australian wicket-taker: Hauritz 1-41.
The fallout was significant: while the hosts were almost universally roasted, their opponents were lauded to the skies. Talk predominated around the forging of a new world order. "This defeat doesn't mark the end of an era", claimed Gideon Haigh in his blog for "The Guardian". "The era had already ended. And the 13-year green and golden age in international cricket has really been a sequence of overlapping phases, subtly different, distinguished by key retirements: Taylor and Healy in 1999; the Waughs in 2003; Warne and McGrath in 2007." Calls for Shane Warne's return to Test cricket, omnipresent since his retirement in 2007, were now accompanied by calls for him to be given the captaincy in the impending Ashes as well.
Third Test.
Team selections: South Africa picked the same team for the third Test in a row. Brett Lee, Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson were all omitted from the Australian team due to injury. Doug Bollinger and Andrew McDonald were included in the starting eleven, with Ben Hilfenhaus again being left out.
Day One: Australia won the toss for the third time in the series and elected to bat.<br>
After Katich (47) started strongly, Ponting was dismissed first ball for the second time in the series and Australia was 63-2. Hayden (31) and Hussey (30) both struggled, before Clarke (73*) and Haddin (38) came together at 162-5. Australia finished the day on 267-6, from 88 overs.<br>
South Africa seemed flat in the field, with Clarke being dropped twice, but continued to take wickets at regular intervals.<br>
South African wicket-takers: Steyn 2-71, Kallis 1-43, Harris 1-44, Morkel 1-49, and Ntini 1-53.
Day Two: Clarke (138) and Johnson (64) batted through the first sesson without loss - the first time Australia had done so for the series. Late hitting from Hauritz (41) and Siddle (23) lifted the total to 445 all out from 136.2 overs.<br>
South African wicket-takers: Harris 3-84, Steyn 3-95, Duminy 1-14, Kallis 1-54, Morkel 1-89, and Ntini 1-102.<br>
In reply, South Africa lost Smith retired hurt for 30 - with a broken left hand courtesy of a lifter from Johnson. McKenzie (23) and Amla (30*) were patient before Kallis (36*) lifted the scoring rate late in the day.
South Africa finished on 125-1.<br>
Australian wicket-taker: Siddle 1-21.
Day Three: Johnson (2 wickets and a run-out) and McDonald (1 wicket) reduced South Africa to 193-5 (with Smith absent injured) before Boucher (89) and Morkel (40) put on 115 for the 6th wicket. Siddle then took 4-7 in 22 deliveries to have South Africa all out for 327. This gave Australia a lead of 118 on the first innings.<br>
Australian wicket-takers: Siddle 5-59 (his first 5 wicket haul in Test cricket), Johnson 2-69, and McDonald 1-41.<br>
In reply, Australia were 33 without loss from 6 overs.
Day Four: Australia aimed to set South Africa a victory target on the fifth day with Ponting (53) and Katich (61) getting starts. Hussey (45*) anchored the innings while Clarke (41) attempted to score quickly. The declaration at 257-4 set South Africa 376 to win.<br>
South African wicket-takers: Morkel 2-38, Steyn 1-60, and Harris 1-63.<br>
With Smith absent injured Morkel (0) opened the batting with McKenzie. His demise gave Bollinger his first Test wicket. South Africa were 62-1 at the close. The pitch was cracked and showing uneven bounce. South Africa required a further 312 to win from 90 overs on the last day of the Test series for a 3-0 clean sweep.<br>
Australian wicket-taker: Bollinger 1-11.
Day Five: On a deteriorating pitch South Africa lost 3 wickets in each session to be all out for 272. Australia achieved victory with only 11 deliveries left in the match when Graeme Smith, batting for 17 deliveries and 26 minutes with a broken hand and injured elbow, was bowled by Mitchell Johnson. Besides the heroics of Smith, Ntini faced 75 deliveries, Steyn 65 and Harris 43 to get South Africa within sight of a draw.<br>
Australian wicket-takers: Siddle 3-54, McDonald 2-32, Johnson 2-49, Bollinger 2-53, and Hauritz 1-47.

Těšín Theatre (, ) is a theatre in the town of Český Těšín (Czeski Cieszyn), Czech Republic.
It is unique, because it comprises two ensembles, Czech and Polish; plays are presented in both the Czech and Polish languages. The Polish ensemble serves the Polish minority in the Czech Republic. Together with ensembles in Vilna and Lvov it is one of the few theatres outside Poland having a professional Polish ensemble. It was established in 1951.
The theatre was founded in August 1945. It changed its name several times. The current one is from 1991. Until 1961 it operated in several places in the town. In 1961 the new building was built and the theatre was relocated there.

Dorp (band)

Dorp is a South African rock band based in London, England.
History.
Formation.
The band was formed in 1992, under its previous name, The Fauves, by Myburgh Grobbelaar (vocals), Albert Loubser (guitar), Dylan Kemlo (bass guitar), Timothy Rankin (drums) and David Poole (saxophone) in Somerset West at Parel Vallei High School.
In 1995 guitarist Albert Loubser (later known as Albert Frost) left the band to join the Blues Broers and was replaced by Alan Bainbridge. The band then changed its name to Dorp, the current name. Shortly thereafter, vocalist Myburgh Grobbelaar left to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Pieter Bezuidenhout, the current frontman.
In 1996, Dorp released its first album, Indigenous Jewellery, independently, on a label set up by Bezuidenhout, Oom Gert Records. The album had limited distribution and is now out of print. The band changed guitarists once more; Alan Bainbridge left and was replaced by current guitarist Kevin Kieswetter.
The band recorded its second release, a 5-track EP called Five Steps Off The Pacemaker in 1997 on Wildebeest Records, which had a wider distribution. The band released its third disc in 1998, Danger Gevaar Ingozi.
Relocation, 1999.
In 1999 the band decided to relocate to London to try to break international radio. Shortly after arriving, the bassist, drummer and saxophonist returned to South Africa, leaving only singer Piet and guitarist Kevin. They resorted to busking in Covent Garden to pay for food and accommodation. It was not long before they attracted the attention of a Frenchman, Fred Fred Caïou (later known as Fred KU). They gigged for a while, experimenting with different sounds including "drill ’n’ bass disco". The three-piece recorded an EP, called "Boy/Girl", the title track being the first song Piet wrote after the relocation. They eventually enlisted the help of Londoner Rob Driver, to take the drumming seat.
Already making waves, and eccentric new sounds, the arrival of Driver set the Dorp project spectacularly on the way, with four global influences crashing together to forge a virgin sound. Driver's UK rock influences and Caïou’s love of techno made something even wilder when combined with Piet and Kevin’s unique perspective.
The band released its 3rd full length album in 2002 called Tap Into The System on Contains Nut Records.

Peter Edmund Jones

Peter Edmund Jones M.D. (30 October 1843 - 29 June 1909) was a Mississauga Ojibwa chief of New Credit. In Ojibwe he was called Kahkewaquonaby, named after his father in two languages. 
The third child of Peter Jones and Eliza Field, Jones was born in London, Canada West. He was raised at the Muncey Mission, and later Brantford. He was educated first by his governess, and later at Brantford Grammar School. Although one quarter Indian in heritage, he was raised in a largely western fashion. Jones, who attended medical school at the University of Toronto and Queen's College, obtained a Medical Doctorate in 1866. He is the first known Status Indian to obtain such a degree in Canada. 
After obtaining his medical degree, Jones moved to Hagersville, Ontario and set up a practice in New Credit. Jones became involved in politics, both on the reserve and off. He was elected a chief of New Credit from 1874–1877, and 1880-1886. He developed connections in the Conservative Party of Canada, where he argued for more Native rights and more Native control over their affairs. Unsuccessful in this, he did receive an appointment as the Indian Agent for New Credit in 1887, which he held until 1896.
Jones edited "The Indian", a journal for Indians. The journal was published in 1885-1886, and ran a total of 24 issues. It was the first Canadian journal for Indians edited by an Indian. The journal was distributed on Indian Reserves across Ontario.
Like his father, Jones lived across the cultural gap between the Whites and Indians of Canada. He married an English woman, Charlotte Dixon, but intended to raise any children as Indians. His cousin George Henry attempted to dislodge him as the New Credit band's doctor on the grounds that he was only one-quarter Indian, but failed. Jones practiced taxidermy, which was eschewed by Indians, and was an avid chess player. But he also refused to relinquish his Indian status, a practice that was encouraged by the Indian Department for educated Indians.

<doc id="18757926" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18757926" title="Indian Department">
Indian Department

The Indian Department was established in 1755 to oversee relations between the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and those First Nations in British North America. At that time of its establishment it was a wing of the British Military (British Army).
Initially, two departments were created. The superintendent of the northern department, responsible for negotiations with the Indians living north of the Ohio River, was Sir William Johnson who held the position until 1774. For the Southern Department, the superintendent was Edmund Atkins. In 1774, Colonel Guy Johnson succeeded William Johnson and held the position until 1782, at which point he was succeeded by Sir John Johnson, who held the position until 1796.
After 1796, responsibility for Indian affairs in Upper Canada was assigned to the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. In 1800, responsibility for Indian affairs in Lower Canada was assigned to the Governor General of Canada. In 1816, responsibility was transferred to the Commander of the Armed Forces in North America. In practice, Indian affairs were managed and supervised through the offices of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and the offices of the of Inspector General of the Department of Indian Affairs. Both these offices were abolished in 1828, and Major-General H.C. Darling took the position of Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs, supervising the Indian Department.
In 1830, the Indian Department was split into two, with one for Upper Canada and one for Lower Canada. In Upper Canada, the Lieutenant-Governor appointed a Chief Superintendent to oversee the department, in Lower Canada the Military Secretary oversaw the department. That year, Colonel James Givins was appointed in Upper Canada, and Lieutenant-Colonel Duncan C. Napier was appointed in Lower Canada. Samuel Jarvis replaced Givins in 1837.
In 1841, the Canadas were amalgamated into the Province of Canada, and the Governor-General assumed direct oversight of the Indian Department. In practice, his secretary handled most of the day to day operation of the department. This situation continued until 1860, when responsibility for the Indian Department was turned over from the British government to the Government of Canada. Indian Affairs fell under the jurisdiction of the Crown Lands Department, and the commissioner of that department was appointed the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs. That role was filled by Philip M.M.S. Vankoughnet from 1860 to 1862, George Sherwood in 1862, William McDougall from 1862 to 1864, and Sir Alexander Campbell from 1864 until 1867. Upon confederation, responsibility for Indian affairs was made the jurisdiction of the Federal government.
Upon confederation, the Federal government took control of Indian affairs in Canada. From 1867 until 1873, the Secretary of State for Canada was also named the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. In 1873, the role of Superintendent General of Indians Affairs was turned over to the Minister of the Department of the Interior. In 1880, a separate Department of Indian Affairs was created. The Minister of the Department of the Interior was the Minister of the Department of Indian Affairs until 1883, when the Privy Council assumed the role, and the Minister of the Department of the Interior was the Minister of the Department of Indian affairs from 1887 until 1930, when it was briefly turned over to the Minister of the Department of Immigration and Colonization, and then back to the Department of the Interior until 1935.
In 1936, the office of Superintendent General of Indians Affairs was abolished, and Indian affairs were governed through the Minister of the Department of Mines and Resources. In 1950, responsibility for Indian affairs was transferred to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. It remained there until 1965, when the Department of Northern Affairs was assigned to the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources, which became the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.

Tricontinental Chile

Tricontinental Chile () is a geopolitic concept used in Chile to denote Chile's unique position with its mainland in South America, Easter Island in Oceania and the Chilean Antarctic Territory claims in Antarctica.
Continental Chile.
Mainland Chile corresponds to the strip of territory along the southwestern coast of South America and its adjacent islands. Almost the entire population lives in continental Chile. It extends from 17°30’ south latitude at the northern borders with Peru and Bolivia to the Diego Ramírez Islands at 56°30’ south latitude. Chile's maximum width of 445 km at the latitude of 52°21’, at the Strait of Magellan. Its minimum width is at 31°37’ south between Punta Amolanas and Paso de la Casa de Piedra.
Insular Chile.
Insular Chile consists of a group of islands of volcanic origin located in the South Pacific far from the continental coast. In the eastern group are the Juan Fernández Islands and the Desventuradas Islands, which are grouped with South America, while Easter Island and the Isla Salas y Gómez are geographically part of Polynesia, forming part of Oceania. Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, is the westernmost territory of the country, situated approximately at 27° south latitude and 109° west longitude.
Chilean Antarctica.
Finally, Chile claims part of Antarctica as what is called the Chilean Antarctic Territory. This claim of 1,250,000 km² extends between the meridians of 53° and 90° west longitude and from 60° south latitude to the South Pole, partly overlapping with the claims of Argentina and the United Kingdom. Chile, as a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty System, has accepted the suspension of its claims of sovereignty without renouncing them, as well as the establishment of a conservation zone for scientific development.
If the claimed territory in Antarctica were included, the total area of Chile would be 2,006,096 km², while the distance between the northern and southern extremes would be more than 8000 km.
Between these three distinct zones is the so-called Chilean Sea; portions of the continental shelf lie within the exclusive economic zone of 200 miles.

<doc id="18757970" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18757970" title="USS Yazoo (AN-92)">
USS Yazoo (AN-92)

USS "Yazoo" (YN-121/AN-92) was a "Cohoes"-class net laying ship which was assigned to protect United States Navy ships and harbors during World War II with her anti-submarine nets. Her World War II career was cut short due to the war coming to an end, but, post-war, she was reactivated and served the Navy in a variety of ways until she was decommissioned in 1962.
Constructed in Minnesota.
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, "Yazoo" (AN-92) was laid down on 6 July 1969 at Duluth, Minnesota, by the Zenith Dredge Co.; launched on 18 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. S. H. Griffin, the wife of Colonel S. H. Griffin, USA; and commissioned on 31 May 1945, Lt. Lionel Krisel, USNR, in command.
World War II related service.
"Yazoo" departed Duluth on 15 June, bound for the Atlantic Ocean; travelling via the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway; and arrived at the Boston Navy Yard to commence fitting out. After shakedown training out of Melville, Rhode Island, she underwent post-shakedown alterations at Boston, Massachusetts. She conducted net defense evolutions at Melville before beginning net-laying operations which she carried out in the vicinities of Newport, Rhode Island, New York City, and Boston during the next 18 months.
Post-war service.
"Yazoo" departed Newport on 13 May 1947 and laid fleet moorings at Argentia, Newfoundland, before returning from that cruise on 18 August to resume local operations. She operated out of Newport into 1948. In January of that year, her duties included ice-breaking in the channels of Narragansett Bay after the severe winter weather had frozen the water there.
Operation Martex.
That spring, "Yazoo" pulled a large Navy cargo vessel off the beach at Davisville, Rhode Island. between 22 and 25 April 1948 and then made a cruise to Terceira, in the Azores, during September and October of that year, to lay a fleet mooring there. She spent much of the year following her return to the eastern seaboard serving as a target ship for submarines and towing targets for surface battle practices. She conducted similar operations in 1950., with time out in June of that year for laying a light indicator net during Operation Martex.
After an overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard (South Carolina) from July to September 1950, "Yazoo" trained out of Norfolk, Virginia, before she resumed extensive work with nets off Newport. During March 1951, "Yazoo" took part in U.S. Atlantic Fleet mining exercises out of Key West, Florida, and then spent the remainder of the year performing mine tests and exercises out of Charleston. Between February and April 1952, "Yazoo" laid nets off Cape Henry during exercises in the Chesapeake Bay.
In January 1953, semi-permanent mine tracks were installed on the net-layer, enabling the ship to lay 24 moored-type naval mines. On 9 January, the ship's home port was changed to, to enable her to commence a schedule of tests and exercises under the auspices of the Operational Development Force.
Operation Hardex.
She participated in Operation Hardex off the Virginia Capes in June and July of that year before she resumed duty out of Key West later that summer. She performed services for the Mine Evaluation Detachment from April to August of the following year and—after salvage operations off Key Largo, Florida—joined in Atlantic Fleet exercises that extended along the eastern seaboard of the United States during October 1954.
Operation Canminus.
"Yazoo" continued her routine of local operations out of Key West into 1955. During most of March of that year, the ship took part in one of the largest fleet mine exercises ever held. In one phase of the operation, she planted U.S. Coast Guard buoys marking a channel; and she was one of the final ships to clear the area after the resultant clean-up operation. In April 1955, the ship's home port was again changed—this time back to Charleston—and she took part in a joint United States-Canadian exercise, Operation Canminus in which "Yazoo" operated as principal minelaying and recovery ship.
During the summer of 1955, "Yazoo" conducted mine exercises out of Key West, Port Everglades, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, with the Atlantic Fleet Mine Force. She spent September and November in company with and , carrying out a special project off the coast of Fedhala, French Morocco, the site of the original American landings in North Africa in November 1942. On her return voyage, "Yazoo" called at Gibraltar, the Azores, and Bermuda, and reached Charleston on 9 December 1955. She entered the naval shipyard there on 6 January 1956 for an overhaul and, later that spring, carried out refresher training out of Norfolk, Virginia, and two weeks of net-tending training at the Harbor Defense Unit, Little Creek, Virginia.
"Yazoo" joined and , on 18 June 1956, in carrying out a special mine project off the coast of Charleston and Cape Romain, South Carolina, that lasted until 23 July. After that task, "Yazoo" again operated out of Key West, providing services to the Mine Warfare Evaluation Detachment in a Mine Force special project. 
Later, during Atlantic Fleet mining exercises between 29 October and 24 November, "Yazoo" laid two large Coast Guard buoys; assisted in establishing a 10-mile exercise channel with Coast Guard lighted buoys and dan buoys; laid surface minefields; delivered triangulation data to the umpiring group during aerial minelaying; and participated in the mine recovery and clean-up phase. She then proceeded to Key West, where she conducted a Mine Force special project in company with and .
In the spring of 1957, "Yazoo" cruised in the Caribbean with the Mine Force and called at San Juan, Puerto Rico; Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; and Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic. Upon her return to Charleston, the ship carried out several special mine projects in local areas and spent a "fortnight" operating with the Mine Warfare Evaluation Detachment at Key West. After an overhaul in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard from July to August 1957, "Yazoo" conducted refresher training out of Charleston and participated in a service mine test.
Exercise Sweep Clear III.
Recovering a 200-year-old cannon.
The ship spent the first three weeks of 1958 training with the Harbor Defense Unit at Norfolk before she shifted southward to Charleston to participate in Atlantic Fleet amphibious exercises. During July and August of that year, "Yazoo" participated in Exercise Sweep Clear III, a NATO minesweeping exercise near Sydney, Nova Scotia. During the cruise—on 26 July 1958—the net layer visited Louisburg, Nova Scotia, and recovered a cannon from a French man-of-war that sank on 26 July 1758—two hundred years earlier!
Following her return to Charleston on 15 August, "Yazoo" took part in fleet service mine tests and trained foreign mine warfare officers in the Charleston vicinity. She spent the remainder of 1958 in operations out of Charleston and off the Virginia Capes.
Exercise Clear Sweep IV.
Overhauled at the Charleston Naval Shipyard between February and May 1959, "Yazoo" conducted refresher training and then took part in Exercise Clear Sweep IV off Charleston. Among the ship's duties performed in that vicinity were conducting net training and type training, planting buoys, and laying practice mines for mine warfare schools. 
During September 1959, "Yazoo" carried out sweep gear evaluation for the U.S. Bureau of Ships in the Charleston area before she returned to active operations as a minelaying and recovery unit during Fleet exercises off the Virginia Capes and at Onslow Bay, North Carolina.
"Yazoo" again took part in amphibious exercises at Onslow Bay in January 1960, before she carried out service mine tests out of Charleston that lasted into the spring. In July 1960, "Yazoo" received the battle efficiency competition award for the fiscal year 1960.
Operation Clear Sweep V.
That autumn, "Yazoo" distinguished herself while participating in Operation Clear Sweep V off Nova Scotia. On 12 October, "Yazoo" received special praise for towing 35 miles to port after that minecraft had suffered a materiel casualty. 
Three days later, on the 15th, when the Canadian escort maintenance ship suffered a casualty, "Yazoo" came to the rescue and towed the ship out of dangerous waters, saving her from almost certain grounding in the shoals of Shelburne Harbor.
After returning southward, "Yazoo" underwent a lengthy overhaul at Charleston from November 1960 to February 1961. She operated again with the Mine Force in the Caribbean from February to March 1961, taking part in Fleet amphibious warfare exercises before completing a service mine test off Charleston.
Underwater detonation exercises.
That spring, she again participated in exercises off Charleston with Canadian minesweeping and minelaying units and then underwent harbor net training at Norfolk. In July, "Yazoo" cruised off the coast of Maine, detonating underwater explosions under the auspices of the Office of Naval Research for the Carnegie Institute of Washington, D.C., and received commendations for a job well done from both agencies.
"Yazoo" underwent repairs at Charleston from late July 1961 into September, before she resumed her schedule of mining exercises and net training out of Charleston and Norfolk.
Post-service inactivation.
After a year of such duty, she was decommissioned on 28 August 1962. Assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, "Yazoo" was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1963 and transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration (MarAd) for lay up in the James River. She remained in MarAd custody until sometime between 1973 and 1975.

M&amp;M's video games

Since 2000, there have been six officially licenced M&M's video games. The first of these games is entitled "The Lost Formula," shortly followed in the same year by "Minis Madness," "Shell Shocked" in 2001, "Kart Racing", "Break Em'" both in 2008, and "Beach Party" in 2009.
M&M's: The Lost Formulas.
M&M's: The Lost Formulas is the first M&M's video game and was released on September 28, 2000 for computers such as Windows 95, Windows 98, and Macintosh by Simon & Schuster Interactive. It is a Crash Bandicoot style game, and also is optionally a game which teaches maths.

. The game has a total of 8 levels.
Reception.
The game was criticised for being based on a candy product, and for being incredibly similar in gameplay to Crash Bandicoot in adventure mode. Its "Math Mode" was praised for having fun features, but not so much having problems as much as having math facts. It was also criticised for being too easy on higher difficulties. However, critics did praise the high-quality graphics and controls of the game.
M&M's: Minis Madness.
M&M's: Minis Madness is a game for the Game Boy Color released in late 2000 for American markets. It was rated 6 out of 10 by Nintendo Power.

"GameRankings.com" gave this game 22.5%, with the game's nearest "rival" being "Shrek Swamp Kart Speedway" with 24.4%. This game was given the "Flat-Out Worst Game" award in the 2008 "GameSpot" video game awards. "IGN" was a little more forgiving, but not too much, giving the DS version 3/10 and the Wii version 2.5/10.
M&M's Adventure.

Ronald Giles

Judge Ronald Giles is the Chief Judge of Michigan's 36th District Court in Detroit, Michigan.
Biography.
Judge Giles was born in Detroit where he attended Cass Technical High School. He served in the U.S. Army as a Medical Corpsman and Neuropsychiatry Specialist before attending Wayne State University where he received his Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice, and a Master of Arts in Guidance and Counseling. He also received his law degree at Wayne State. As an attorney, Judge Giles practiced for 22 years and worked as general counsel for a community mental health organization, a hearing referee for the Michigan Department of Civil Rights and maintained a general law practice with a concentration in Juvenile law, Criminal law, Family law, Immigration and Civil Rights.
Kwame Kilpatrick.
Giles came to national attention on August 7, 2008, when he remanded Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to Wayne County Jail for violating the terms of his bond. The mayor had been charged with perjury, misconduct and obstruction of justice, and took an unauthorized trip to Windsor, Ontario, without the Court's knowledge or permission. Judge Giles' order represented the first time in Detroit history that a sitting mayor had been ordered to jail. In making his ruling, Judge Giles said he was required to make his ruling as though it were "John Sixpack" sitting in front of him and not the Mayor of Detroit. When Judge Giles was assigned to the Kilpatrick case, prosecutors had moved to disqualify him because he had previously made a $300 contribution to a past Kilpatrick political campaign. No basis was found to disqualify Judge Giles, and he continued to handle the case. In late July 2008, Judge Giles had reduced Kilpatrick’s bond from $75,000 to $7,500, but also revoked Kipatrick's privilege to travel without a court hearing. Judge Giles also ordered Kilpatrick to undergo periodic and random drug testing at that time. When Kilpatrick was accused of pushing a process server around the same time, Judge Giles warned the mayor in open court, saying, “You’re a licensed attorney. You’re a public official. Everything you do, every step you take, every word you say is somewhere recorded for everyone to hear. You need to keep that in mind.”

The Fixed Period

The Fixed Period (1882) is a satirical dystopian novel by Anthony Trollope.
Introduction.
It was first published in six instalments in "Blackwood's Magazine" in 1881–82 and in book form in 1882. In the same year there also appeared US and Tauchnitz editions of the novel. There were no further editions until 1981. "The Fixed Period" is Trollope's only piece of dystopian writing.
Trollope was influenced in writing the book by "The Old Law", a 17th-century tragicomedy written by Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, and Philip Massinger which he had read, and commented upon, in 1876. "The Fixed Period" is set in the year 1980 in the Republic of Britannula, a fictional island in the vicinity of New Zealand, and deals with euthanasia as a radical solution to the problem of the aged. The novel takes the form of a personal account written by the President of Britannula about the island's recent history. It has frequently been remarked that when the book came out Trollope himself had reached the age of 67, the exact age at which all Britannulans are obliged by law to retire from their worldly affairs and begin a year of preparation for death.
Life in Britannula and the concept of the "Fixed Period".
Britannula is a former British Crown Colony which demanded, and was granted, independence from Great Britain in the mid-20th century. Its 250,000 inhabitants have, with few exceptions, retained British law and customs, and also her currency. Britannula is a thriving agrarian society whose wealth is mainly based on sheep farming and the wool trade. Its capital, Gladstonopolis, is named after 19th century British Liberal statesman and Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone.
After independence and self-government had been gained, the Britannulans set about to organise their political system. According to the Britannulan Constitution, the Assembly, their unicameral parliament, consists of 85 Senators, who are the elected representatives of the people of Britannula. As there are hardly any differences between social classes, and as there is no aristocracy, the institutionalisation of an upper house was not deemed necessary. Also, as opposed to Great Britain, there is no capital punishment. The Republic of Britannula is headed by an elected President.
The first legislative Assembly of about 30 years ago consisted mainly of young, energetic men who were eager to build a modern state. When a proposal was made to terminate citizens' lives at a fixed age to spare them undignified suffering and to help cut down on the state's expenditure on unproductive people, it got an overwhelming majority. The age was fixed at 67, at which time a citizen's "deposition" was to take place, consisting of their removal to "The College", an institution situated in the town of Necropolis, followed by their "departure", and subsequent cremation, exactly one year later, at the age of 68. No "departures" have been administered so far as none of Britannula's inhabitants has yet reached their "Fixed Period."
The concept of the New Woman has never been known to Britannulans, and there is no feminist movement to speak of. Rather, women still behave and act as if they were living in the Victorian era. They have no role whatsoever in public or business life and lead a quiet and submissive domestic existence. Sex outside marriage is not practised.
Plot summary.
Gabriel Crasweller, a successful merchant-farmer and landowner, is Britannula's oldest citizen. Born in 1913, he emigrated from New Zealand when he was a young man and was instrumental in building the new republic as one of a group of similar-minded men which included his best friend John Neverbend, ten years his junior, who is now serving his term as President of Britannula. Whereas decades ago Crasweller also voted in favour of the law which introduced the "Fixed Period," he gradually becomes more pensive as the day of his deposition is approaching. Neverbend has long been planning that day and envisaging it as a day of triumph, believing that mankind and civilisation will move an enormous step forward towards perfection. As the originator of the idea, Neverbend also hopes that his name will go down in the annals of history as one of the great reformers. He considers it unfortunate that his friend Crasweller, as the first one to go, does not show any of the signs of old age for which "the Law" was made in the first place: Crasweller is healthy and vigorous, his mental abilities have not started to deteriorate in any way, and accordingly he is more than capable of managing his own affairs and of earning his living.
When all of a sudden Crasweller starts lying about his age and claiming that he was in fact born a year later, Neverbend realises that measures must be taken to ensure the smooth execution of the Law. However, he soon finds out that it has dawned on other elderly citizens as well what the state has in store for them, and that various individuals have come up with all kinds of excuses and plans as to how they are going to oppose their deposition and, eventually, departure. He finds a supporter in Abraham Grundle, one of the young Senators, but is shocked when he realises that Grundle, who is engaged to Crasweller's daughter Eva, only wants to inherit his friend's fortune as soon as possible. But despite this setback, and although both his own son Jack and his wife Sarah turn against him, Neverbend, who has long since passed the point of no return, considers it his duty as President and law-abiding citizen to have Crasweller deposited.
As a man of honour, Crasweller finally yields to Neverbend's arguments and stoically accepts his fate. However, on the very day of his deposition the carriage that is to transport the two men to the College is held up in the streets of Gladstonopolis by British armed forces. They have arrived on a warship of enormous dimensions and, by threatening to destroy the whole city with their "250-lb swivel gun," compel Neverbend to release Crasweller and eventually to step down as President. Britannula is re-annexed by Great Britain, a Governor is installed, and John Neverbend is forced to return to England with them.
During the passage Neverbend commits to paper the recent history of Britannula, finishing it only two days before his arrival in England. He plans to write another, more theoretical book on the "Fixed Period" and to preach to the English about this necessary step in the progress of mankind. However, he realises that he does not really know whether he will be treated with respect in the old country or not, or whether he will ever be able to return to Britannula.
The science fiction element in "The Fixed Period".
Raymond Carr notes that
the publication of the book shocked a public accustomed to find in Trollope the chronicler of contemporary social life. [...] It is an essay in science fiction. Technology will produce 250-lb "swivel guns" that can destroy a city. Naval officers are equipped with mobile (hair) phones. The inhabitants ride steam tricycles, cricketers employ "a mechanical steam bowler." But he was no H. G. Wells. The Britannulans still go round in horse-drawn carriages.
In the field of transportation, generally, the absence of any airborne vehicles is quite striking: when the British cricket team travels to Britannula they do so on a steam ship, and it takes them several weeks to reach their destination. In telecommunications, apart from the above-mentioned "hair telephone," "water telegrams" and a "reporting-telephone apparatus" – all of which were only slight refinements of pre-existing Victorian technology – seem to be the only important inventions. The latter machine enables newspaper readers in London to read a speech held in Gladstonopolis only one hour after it has been given.
William Osler's "Fixed Period" speech.
In 1905, after he had been appointed Professor of Medicine at Oxford, Canadian physician William Osler gave a farewell address on leaving Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in which he referred to Trollope's "The Fixed Period" in a humorous manner. His words were misconstrued, and Osler was quoted as having advocated euthanasia ("Osler recommends chloroform at sixty").

Salicornia oil is a pressed oil, derived from the seeds of the "Salicornia bigelovii", a halophyte (salt-loving plant) native to Mexico. 
The use of salicornia as an oil crop has been championed by researcher Carl Hodges, and was the subject of a 1991 New York Times article. More recently, Hodges and his team have continued their work in Mexico, irrigating fields with sea water in farms near the Sea of Cortez. Salicornia seeds contain 30% oil by weight, compared to 17-20% for soybeans. The oil itself contains 72% linoleic acid, which is comparable to safflower oil.

First General Army (Japan)

The was an army group of the Imperial Japanese Army responsible for the defense of eastern and northern Honshū, including the Tōkai and Kantō regions during the final stage of Pacific War.
History.
The First General Army was established on April 8, 1945 with the dissolution of the General Defense Command into the First and Second General Army. It was essentially a home guard and garrison, responsible for civil defense, anti-aircraft defenses, and for organizing guerilla warfare cells in anticipation of the projected Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands in Operation Downfall (or in Japanese terminology). Although its territory encompassed all of northern Japan, its primary mission was to ensure the security of the heavily populated Kantō region, which included Tokyo. Its forces consisted mostly of poorly trained and poorly armed reservists, conscripted students and home guard militia.
The First General Army remained active for several months after the surrender of Japan to help maintain public order until the arrival of the American occupation forces, and to oversee the final demobilization and dissolution of the Imperial Japanese Army.

Aleksandar Prijović

Aleksandar Prijović (Serbian Cyrillic: Aлeкcaндap Пpиjoвић; born 21 April 1990) is a Swiss footballer of Serbian descent who plays for Djurgårdens IF.
Career.
Early career.
Prijović started his career as a youth player with his home town club FC St. Gallen but moved to Italy at the age of 16 to start his football career with Italian side Parma, making the first appearance of his career as a substitute for Parma on 27 April 2008 in a match against Reggina Calcio. Prijović's contract with Parma finished at the end of the 2007/08 season and he rejected the offer of a new one-year deal with the club.
Derby County.
Prijović went on trial with English Championship side Derby County where he caught the eye by scoring a hat-trick as Derby's academy side beat Arsenal youth 4–1. Derby offered Prijović a two-year contract. He provisionally signed for Derby on 7 August 2008, subject to international clearance. His full signing was delayed by issues over international clearance, firstly following disagreements over the player's registration which was sorted when Derby agreed to pay Prijović's former club, Parma, an undisclosed amount as compensation and then by the Swiss army, who made Prijović return home to complete his spell with them. On 27 January 2009, Prijović joined League One Yeovil Town on a months loan, playing four times before returning early due to illness.
On 16 March, Prijović joined Northampton Town on loan for a month. He made his debut in the 4–0 win over Stockport County and impressed the fans. He scored his first professional goal in the 3–2 defeat to Southend United. He then scored his second in the 3–1 victory away at Leyton Orient.
On 6 July 2009, he was called for a trial period with Germany based club MSV Duisburg before he joined OB Odense on a similar deal in November 2009, where he impressed with a goal in a trial match. Of Prijović, Derby boss Nigel Clough said "They are very interested in taking him in January so we are just trying to get a deal done if they want to do one. If not, we will probably look to get him out on loan. If we can do it before the deadline, we will do. If not, in January." He eventually signed for FC Sion for a nominal fee on 1 February 2010.
Sion.
While on loan at Lausanne, he went on a trial with the Norwegian club, Molde at their training camp in Marbella, Spain in February 2012. He played one match for Molde, the pre-season match against the Spanish club Xerez CD, but was not offered a contract.
On 31 July 2012, Tromsø signed Prijović on a one-year loan deal, with an option to buy. Tromsø's head coach Per-Mathias Høgmo stated that Molde's manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær and coach Mark Dempsey had recommended Prijovic after the trial. Prijović got his debut coming in off the bench for the last 22 minutes of an away loss to Fredrikstad on 5 August. Four days later he made his first start and scored his first goal in the away leg of the third qualifying round of the 2012-13 UEFA Europa League against Metalurh Donetsk, ensuring a 2–1 aggregate win for Tromsø.
Tromsø could not afford to extend Prijović' loan-deal, and he returned to Sion when the loan-deal expired on 1 July 2013.
Djurgårdens IF.
On 15 August 2013, Prijović signed a 2,5 years contract with the Stockholm-based club Djurgårdens IF, where he was reunited with his coach from Tromsø, Per-Mathias Høgmo. In his starting debut for Djurgårdens IF Prijovic scored a hattrick, when IFK Norrköping was beaten 3–2.
International career.
Though born in Switzerland, Prijović qualifies for Serbia through his parents and has represented the country at both U17 and U19 level.
However he used his only chance in nationality switch in 2010. He scored in his debut with Switzerland national under-20 football team on 28 April. He collected his second cap on 6 September 2010.
Prijović made his Swiss U21 debut on 10 August 2011. He also played in the next match on 1 September 2011.

Highbury College

Highbury College is a general further education college in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. It provides vocational and academic education and training, from first-step courses to university level foundation degrees, A Levels, specialised services for business and education in the community.
Highbury’s 2010/2011 student success rates make it the top-performing general further education College in the South East (10/11 National LR Success Rates published by The Data Service). The College was inspected by Ofsted in May 2011 and was judged to be Grade 1 Outstanding in all areas.
The College actively promotes lifelong learning and delivers a wide range of adult courses at more than 50 community venues in and around Portsmouth, as well as at Highbury College Centres. Highbury was judged to make an 'outstanding contribution to community cohesion' in its 2011 Ofsted report. The College is also a major provider of apprenticeship training in the South East and currently offers apprenticeships in more than 40 subject areas.
The College has undergone a major redevelopment of accommodation and facilities in recent years and recently completed a £56.4m building programme across the City of Portsmouth, culminating in the opening of the new Highbury Campus by HRH The Princess Royal in October 2009.
Areas of Learning.
The College also offers a range of university level courses:
Highbury’s provision in Literacy, Numeracy & ESOL, Health & Social Care and Hair & Beauty was judged to be outstanding in the College’s most recent Ofsted report (2011).
Highbury NCTJ Diploma in Journalism was recognised as the best-performing newspaper journalism fast-track course in the country for 2007/8. Former Highbury journalism students include political correspondent John Pienaar and Emmy Award winning ITV news presenter Mark Austin.
Origins of Highbury College.
The history of Highbury College can be traced back to the Portsmouth and Gosport School of Science and the Arts, a privately funded organisation that was founded in 1870. The main function of the School was to equip the City’s future engineers and workers with the skills required in Portsmouth’s thriving docks and the Royal Navy Dockyard.
In 1894 the School’s science and technology courses were brought under the control of the local authorities as the Borough of Portsmouth Municipal Technical Institute. The Institute had three main departments: Chemistry, Mathematics & Physics, and Civil & Mechanical Engineering. More than 1,300 students attended evening courses with only a small number of students attending during the day. By 1903 subjects taught included hygiene, biology, physiology, woodcarving, navigation, nautical astronomy and dressmaking.
In 1908 the Institute was renamed the Portsmouth Municipal College, Within a few years the College was offering external degree courses recognised by the University of London. The Municipal College continued to grow until, in the 1930s, a separate institution was formed for teacher training. Similarly, in the 1950s Art & Design also became an independent unit. 
The Municipal College was designated a regional College by the Department of Education and Science in the 1950s and renamed the Portsmouth College of Technology. 
As a result of the continued rapid expansion of adult and technical education the Local Education Authority (LEA) decided to establish a branch college at Cosham, which provided convenient access for the people of Portsmouth and beyond. The main purpose of this was to enable the Portsmouth College of Technology to concentrate on courses at graduate and postgraduate level, which it has done ever since – initially as Portsmouth Polytechnic and more recently as the University of Portsmouth.
Official Opening of Highbury College.
Highbury College was officially opened on 17 September 1963 as Highbury Technical College. Built at a cost of £590,700, the College was originally designed for a student population of 2,800, but 5,000 students enrolled in the first year.
Overcrowding quickly became a problem and the College leased huts at Rugby Camp, Hilsea, for use as temporary classrooms. The huts had rudimentary facilities, and are soon referred to as the 'Army Camp' by students and staff alike.
A full-time teaching staff of 78, plus part-time staff and visiting lecturers were responsible for delivering Highbury's courses. The College commenced with six Departments: Building & Surveying, Commerce & General Studies, Domestic Studies, Engineering, Mathematics & Science and Hotel & Catering.
The College concentrated on vocational and non-degree level courses so that it would not compete with Portsmouth College of Technology, which later became the University of Portsmouth. In its first year the College offered courses at craft and technician levels, leading to full technological certificates awarded through the City & Guilds. In addition, students could study for O Levels and A Levels, as well as Ordinary National Certificates and Diplomas. Higher National Certificates (HNCs) in Building and Civil Engineering were offered part-time.
One of the innovative features of the new College was its language laboratory – the first of its kind on the South Coast of England, which included soundproof cubicles and audio and visual equipment. The language laboratory was introduced with the Common Market in mind and was popular with local businesses wanting to train their staff as a result of increases in exports.
A new block for science teaching was officially opened on 9 February 1966 by Reginald Prentice, then Minister of State for the Department of Education. At the same time student numbers were swelled by the opening of an Apprentice Training Centre.
The Tower.
A major extension was completed in 1970, which included a 10-storey Tower. 
In 1970 responsibility for the Dockyard Technical College was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the Local Education Authority, resulting in another 700 students for Highbury. 
Alongside the new accommodation, Highbury began the new decade with new modern teaching equipment, which included a radiological laboratory and a new digital computer. Pride of place, however, went to the College’s new Closed Circuit Television studio (CCTV), which included a broadcast news studio that was able to send programmes to 40 classrooms throughout the College, many of which were made by College staff.
By 1971 the College had expanded to ten departments, with 324 full-time teaching staff. Most significantly, Portsmouth Technical College's Hotel & Catering Department was taken over by Highbury when the Technical College assumed polytechnic status.
The Department's rapid growth necessitated the use of annexes around the City until H Block (pictured above), a new facility for Hotel & Catering courses, was opened in 1981. H Block was Britain’s biggest educational building project at that time and was officially opened on 9 October 1981 by Lord Romsey.
Making links.
In 1974 Highbury welcomed its first visitors from Friedrich Albert Lange Vocational College, Duisburg in Germany. The link between the two colleges has remained strong ever since, resulting in a number of beneficial activities including student and staff exchanges.
Student numbers rose steadily over the decade and by 1976 student enrolment reached 10,000.
In the late 1970s the College was approved by the Council for Academic Awards to offer degree courses jointly with Portsmouth Polytechnic, the first of which was a Degree in Hotel and Catering Studies. In recognition of this the College changed its name to Highbury College of Technology in 1978.
Unicorn Training Centre.
In 1982 the former Naval Dockyard Apprentice Training Centre came under civilian management and, as the Unicorn Training Centre, began a transition to a multi-skills training centre for apprentices, school leavers and the unemployed. Highbury took over the new facility in 1983, using it to teach students and apprentices in construction and electrical/electronic trades.
Incorporation.
On 1 April 1993 Highbury left local Government control and, under Incorporation, responsibility for the operation of the College now lay with Highbury College Corporation, with members drawn from industry and commerce as well as academic and support staff, the Student Union President and the Principal & chief executive.
In 2000 the completion of a £2.2m refurbishment project resulted in new library facilities and the re-cladding of College blocks and the Tower. The Library development included study areas and seminar rooms and was officially opened in 2001 by John Monks, then General Secretary of the TUC.
Expansion and renovation
In 2002 the College completed a major renovation that included the conversion of the top five floors of the Tower into student accommodation and five floors of refurbished teaching spaces below to include a digital media suite and computer centre.
That same year also saw the official opening of Highbury Apex Centre, which now caters for 14–16-year old school pupils, teaching them vocational skills such as bricklaying, plastering and decorating.
Plans to expand the College's provision in the City Centre were also implemented with the lease of a building adjacent to an existing College site in Arundel Street. Named Highbury City Centre (later to be Highbury Arundel Centre), the facility now includes Eden, a training salon for Hair & Beauty students.
Highbury Northarbour Centre.
Highbury Northarbour Centre opened in 2004. About 2,000 students signed up for courses in the first year, and today Highbury Northarbour Centre trains students in construction and the built environment, with dedicated workshops for each discipline and a specialist construction library.
New beginnings.
In 2006 a new three-Colleges-in-one structure was introduced that anticipated national developments in Government priorities. The Collegiate, Corporate and Community Colleges organised the College's provision under three main umbrellas and were introduced so that the College could maintain a clear focus on the needs of its three main client groups: young people aged 14–19, employers and adult learners in the community.
Highbury City of Portsmouth Centre (HCPC) opened in October 2007 following several years of careful planning. A major feature of the Centre was that training could take place in real-life working environments. Facilities at HCPC include industry-standard training kitchens and Chimes Fine Dining, an 80-seat training restaurant that is open to the public.
Running in parallel with the development of HCPC was the redevelopment of Highbury Campus. State-of-the-art teaching and learning environments have replaced old and outdated buildings at the Cosham site, many of which dated back to the opening of the College in 1963.
Marine Training Programmes.
Highbury College provides a range of vocational and academic programs in and around Portsmouth including Marine Apprenticeship, Boat Construction Maintenance, and Yacht Maintenance.

Wyoming Highway 14

Wyoming Highway 14 (WYO 14) is a long unsigned Wyoming state highway connecting Wyoming Highway 130 with Laramie Regional Airport, just west of Laramie.
Route description.
Highway 14 may be one of the shortest state-maintained routes in the state, at just in length. It connects WYO 130 (Snowy Range Road) with Laramie Regional Airport.
History.
Wyoming Highway 14 was the old designation for the current ALT US 14 between Cody and Burgess Junction located in Park and Big Horn Counties in northwestern Wyoming. That routing existed between 1940 and approximately 1965. Confusion between WYO 14 and US 14 caused the Wyoming Highway Department to recommission Wyoming Highway 14 as Alternate US 14.

Salicornia bigelovii

Salicornia bigelovii is a species of flowering plant in the amaranth family known by the common names dwarf saltwort and dwarf glasswort. It is native to coastal areas of the eastern and southern United States, as well as southern California and coastal Mexico. It is a plant of salt marshes, a halophyte which grows in saltwater. It is an annual herb producing an erect, branching stem which is jointed at many internodes. The fleshy, green to red stem can reach about 60 cm in height. The leaves are usually small plates, pairs of which are fused into a band around the stem. The inflorescence is a dense, sticklike spike of flowers. Each flower is made up of a fused pocket of sepals enclosing the stamens and stigmas, with no petals. The fruit is an utricle containing tiny, fuzzy seeds. The southern part of the species range is represented by the Petenes mangroves of the Yucatán, where it is a subdominant plant associate in the mangroves.
Uses.
This plant is gaining scientific attention for its potential to serve as an oil crop that can be grown in desert environments and maintained with water containing high levels of salts. It is the source of salicornia oil. The plant is up to 33% oil. The oil contains up to 79% linoleic acid and is functionally similar to safflower oil. It can be used as a cooking oil and a replacement for more valuable oils in chicken feed. Domestic animals can be fed the plant as a forage. The plant could also be a source of biofuel.
Since the plant is a halophytic coastline species which grows in saltwater, it can be irrigated with seawater, making it a potential crop for landscapes that can support few other crop plants. The plants can also be watered with high-salt drainage water, such as the effluent from farmland in California's Central Valley. Fields of the plant have been grown in wastewater from aquaculture farms in Eritrea and harvested for animal feed.

Chick Willis

Robert "Chick" Willis (September 24, 1934 – December 7, 2013) was an American blues singer and guitarist who performed and recorded from the 1950s to the 2000s. 
He was born in Cabaniss, Monroe County, Georgia, the cousin of Chuck Willis. He served in the military in the early 1950s before working as a chauffeur for Chuck Willis during his heyday. He won a talent show at the Magnolia Ballroom in Atlanta and made his first record in 1956, with the Ebb Records' single "You're Mine". Initially, he only sang, but learned guitar while touring with his cousin; Guitar Slim was one of his foremost influences.
After Chuck's death in 1958, Willis played with Elmore James, recording singles through the 1960s for Atco and other labels. His 1972 release, "Stoop Down Baby", was a jukebox hit but secured no radio airplay, due to its sexually explicit content. The song was one he had developed when working at a carnival show, where he would tease passers-by with ribald rhymes. Some of his later recordings reworked the song. He released a steady stream of albums on Ichiban Records in the 1980s and 1990s, and continued to record into the 2000s.
He died on December 7, 2013, aged 79.

St. Andrew's Episcopal Church (Brewster, New York)

St. Andrew's Episcopal Church is located at the corner of Prospect and Michael Neuner streets in Brewster, New York, United States. The congregation dates, informally, to 1872, though it was not formally accepted into the American Episcopal Church until ten years later. The building itself was finished in 1903, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
It is the third church built on the site. Seth Howes, a wealthy congregant, offered to pay for the construction of a stone church to replace the first structure, a wooden church. He hired architects Edward Pearce Casey and Arthur Durant Sneden to design a church that recalled the English country churches that were among the first to use the Gothic Revival architectural style. However, this structure burned down within months of being finished and was immediately replaced. The current building features stained glass by Calvert & Kimberly, former students of Louis Comfort Tiffany. The chancel window, dedicated to Howes, is thought to be the work of Tiffany. The main part of the church has not been altered since its completion, although an addition was built in 1961.
Building.
The church occupies half its corner lot. It takes a cruciform shape, with granite-faced stone walls two feet (50 cm) thick. The tower and nave are supported by buttresses. The former is faced with an E. Howard & Co. clock over the heavy (up to ), detailed red wooden double doors at the entrance; the latter has a cross-gabled roof surfaced in slate. The battlemented belfry shelters a bell.
On the south transept is a wooden porch with a second entrance, similar to the first. The north transept leads to the Great Hall wing, built later of sympathetic design and materials.
Inside the nave is a hammerbeam roof, its exposed rafters built of varnished pine. On the floor are two rows of oak pews with three aisles. The south transept, once a vestibule itself, is set off with an oak screen and now has a chapel and columbarium. Opposite, to the north, are more pews, one of the organ's pipe banks. In the
choir are the organ and its other pipe bank, the altar and two ornamental balconies. The stained glass windows along the walls tell the story of Christ, with the chancel window depicting Christ enthroned.
Aesthetics.
Seth Howes, the church's main benefactor at the time of the building's original construction, was particularly taken with the small country churches he had seen while traveling in England, and sought to have his church in a small country town in upstate New York emulate them. The hammerbeam roof is believed to have been something he asked for; in keeping with the style the two architects relied on simplicity and sweeping lines to create beauty, avoiding later Gothic Revival ornamentation such as gargoyles, flying buttresses or columns. It is, even today, one of the few stone churches in Putnam County.
History.
19th century.
In 1872 a group of Brewster townspeople began meeting in what was then the new town hall to hold Sunday school. These continued for eight years until that building burned down in 1880. A Brewster native and founder, Seth Howes, who had returned home to retire after becoming wealthy as a circus entrepreneur and Chicago-area developer, led the congregation in building a small wooden church on the current land. It was opened in 1881; the following year it was formally incorporated and admitted to the Episcopal Diocese of New York, marking the beginning of the church and its parish as a formal entity.
In the next decade, the church established two chapels in nearby rural communities (they were eventually reunited with the church when the land on which one stood was acquired by New York City for one of its reservoirs in the area). Howes, who had been building and expanding his Morningthorpe estate south of Brewster, offered to pay for the building of a newer, more stylish church with surplus stone from that construction job.
He hired Edward Pearce Casey, best known at the time for his work on the Library of Congress's Thomas Jefferson Building (as it is now known), and Arthur Durant Sneden, then chief designer for the New York City Board of Education. Casey sketched out the main plan of the building and Sneden concentrated on the details. At the insistence of Howes, who had traveled abroad and was fond of English country churches, they hewed to that model.
20th–21st centuries.
The church was opened in time for Easter services in 1901, just two weeks before Howes died. Two and a half months later, the inside of the new church was gutted by fire and the building was largely destroyed. It was meticulously rebuilt to the original design and was formally consecrated in 1903.
Starting in the late 1920s, under the leadership of The Rev. F.A. Coleman, the church expanded its membership and started organizations like a Women's Auxiliary, The Girl's Friendly Society and the St. Andrew's Guild to serve the community. In 1961 the Great Hall, the only addition to the original church since its construction and rebuilding, was built to provide community meeting space and Sunday school programs.
The Rev. Lawrence Larson, who took over as rector in the 1980s, further expanded the church's outreach. In addition to the recently-started nursery school, he spearheaded the creation of the Brewster Community Food Pantry in cooperation with two other area churches. Both are still in operation.
In 2000, the congregation called The Rev. Terri Heyduk to serve as its first permanent female rector, a position she held until 2009. She helped the church buy the neighboring house on Prospect Street, which was used as a consignment shop for some time.

Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes

Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes (1856–1936) was a French officer and early historian of technology.
After his early retirement from the French army in 1901, Lefebvre devoted his time to technological studies, then quite a new field, becoming a main proponent of the negative impact of slavery on technological progress in classical antiquity. Although dissenting voices emerged as early as the 1930s, his primitivist views of ancient traction technology met with considerable success in the 1950s and 1960s when authorities like the medievalist Lynn White and the sinologist Joseph Needham, but also many classicists, relied rather uncritically on his research. He was also a good friend of Jean Francois Champollion
Based on a thorough reexamination of the pictorial evidence, much of it not available in Lefebvre's time, as well as experimental archaeology, modern scholars like Georges Raepsaet have refuted Lefebvre's findings, particularly his glaring underestimation of the capacities of ancient horse-drawn ploughs and carriages. His depreciation of the classical quarter-rudder in favour of the medieval stern-mounted rudder has also given way to a more balanced interpretation which argues that the two systems rather differed in the kinds of advantages they offered. Much unlike Lefebvre, recent scholarship has generally come to stress, within the productive limits characteristic of all pre-modern agricultural societies, the innovative character of Greek and Roman technology.

Omniturf

Omniturf was the first artificial surface to be used by an English Football League club. The first club to install this 'plastic grass' surface was Queens Park Rangers who installed the new pitch for the start of the 1981/82 season. Despite much publicity around the supposed unfair advantage the pitch would provide Rangers, they proceeded to lose the opening home Division Two match on the new surface by 1-2 against Luton Town.
The pitch did prove to be successful for Rangers though, as they reached the FA Cup Final in the 1981/82 season (as a 2nd Division club), and then won the (old) 2nd Division Championship the following season.
The innovation at Loftus Road brought mixed results, for while the ball ran smoothly enough over the hard surface, it was unpredictable when allowed to bounce. This caused confusion among defenders and goalkeepers in particular.
The Omniturf pitch lasted at Rangers' Loftus Road ground for seven seasons; the pitch was torn up at the end of the 1987/88 season.
Other Football League clubs which also laid similar artificial surfaces during the 1980s were Luton Town (obviously impressed from the first match), Oldham Athletic, and Preston North End.
One of the few times the surface has been used outside of soccer has been by the University of Missouri, which used it for the playing surface of its football stadium, Faurot Field, from 1985 to 1994. The surface was panned by both Tigers and opponents alike as one of the worst in college football. In 1992, the coaches in the Big Eight Conference issued a statement that Faurot Field's surface was "a detriment to the home and visiting teams and takes away from the integrity of the game played on such a field."

An additional fifth place in Luzern gave them some hope for the World Championships in Eton, but in the end they only finished in an eleventh position there.
In 2007 he started in the lightweight double sculls again, this time with Roeland Lievens and a second place in the World Cup meeting in Linz was the result. The next two World Cups in Amsterdam and Luzern however he would row in the lightweight fours again. With Alwin Snijders, Greidanus and Lievens he became third in Amsterdam. With Gerard van der Linden instead of Greidanus they also became third in Luzern. This was also the team selection for the World Championships in Munich but they only became tenth this time.
For the 2008 season he rowed another two World Cups in the lightweight double sculls with Roeland Lievens. In Munich they became third and in Luzern second. With Marshall Godschalk, Gerard van der Linden and Ivo Snijders he took part in the lightweight fours again in the next World Cup in Poznan. Their fifth position there was enough to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état.
Central African Republic President David Dacko, Jean-Bédel Bokassa's cousin, took over the country in 1960, and Bokassa, a military officer in the French army, joined the CAR army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the communist People's Republic of China, but despite this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming the gendarmerie headed by Izamo of the Sara ethnic group, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.
Tensions between Dacko and Bokassa increased. In December, Dacko approved a budget increase for Izamo's gendarmerie, but rejected the budget proposal for Bokassa's army. At this point, Bokassa told friends he was annoyed by Dacko's treatment and was "going for a coup d'état". Dacko planned to replace Bokassa with Izamo as his personal military adviser, and wanted to promote army officers loyal to the government, while demoting Bokassa and his close associates. Bokassa realized he had to act against Dacko quickly, and worried that his 500-man army would be no match for the gendarmerie and the presidential guard. He was also concerned the French would intervene to aid Dacko, as had occurred after the 23 February 1964 coup d'état in Gabon against President Léon M'ba. After receiving word of the coup from the country's military chief of staff, Omar Bongo, officials in Paris sent paratroopers to Gabon in a matter of hours and M'ba was quickly restored to power.
Bokassa found substantive support from his co-conspirator, Captain Alexandre Banza, who was commander of the Camp Kassaï military base in northeast Bangui, and, like Bokassa, had served in the French army in posts around the world. Banza was an intelligent, ambitious and capable man who played a major role in planning the coup. By December, many people began to anticipate the potential turmoil that would result. Dacko's personal advisers alerted him that Bokassa "showed signs of mental instability" and needed to be arrested before he sought to bring down the government, but Dacko failed to heed these warnings.
Execution of the coup.
Early in the evening of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Palais de la Renaissance to visit one of his ministers' plantations southwest of the capital. At 22:30 WAT (UTC 21:30), Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup: one of his captains was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was to take control of Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a New Year's Eve celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. When asked if he would support the coup, Izamo said no, leading Bokassa and Banza to overpower him and hold him in a cellar. 
At midnight, in the first minutes of January 1, 1966, Bokassa and Banza organized their troops and told them of their plan to take over the government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had resigned from the presidency and given the position to Izamo, then told the soldiers that the gendarmerie would take over the CAR army, which had to act now to keep its position. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were locked up. At 00:30 WAT, Banza, Bokassa and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was nowhere to be found. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found. 
Dacko was not aware of the events taking place in the capital. After leaving his minister's plantation near midnight, he headed to Simon Samba's house to ask the Aka Pgymy leader to conduct a year-end ritual. After an hour at Samba's house, he was informed of the coup in Bangui. Dacko was arrested by soldiers patrolling Pétévo Junction, on the western border of the capital. He was taken back to the presidential palace, where Bokassa hugged the president and told him, "I tried to warn you—but now it's too late". President Dacko was taken to Ngaragba Prison in east Bangui at around 02:00 WAT. In a move that he thought would boost his popularity in the country, Bokassa ordered prison director Otto Sacher to release all prisoners in the jail. Bokassa then took Dacko to Camp Kassaï at 03:20 WAT, where the president was forced by Banza to resign from office. Banza wanted to kill Dacko, but Bokassa would not allow it, believing that Dacko had not yet outlived his usefulness. Later, Bokassa's officers announced on Radio-Bangui that the Dacko government had been toppled and Bokassa had taken over control.
Death.
Bokassa often claimed that he seized power to prevent Izamo from doing the same. For this reason, along with director of the Presidential security service Prosper Mounoumbaye, Bokassa considered Izamo a particularly dangerous individual and "did not rest until they were eliminated". Attempting to escape, he was taken out of his cellar, moved to Camp de Roux, and then to Ngaragba Prison at roughly 10 January. At the end of January, Izamo died from mistreatment and neglect.

Wimpy (restaurant)

Wimpy is the brand name of a chain of fast food restaurants.
History.
The Wimpy brand was created in the 1930s. The name was inspired by the character of J. Wellington Wimpy from the Popeye cartoons created by E. C. Segar. Eddie Gold was running 12 restaurants by the early 1950s, when the concept of fast food came to the attention of the directors of J. Lyons and Co. Lyons licensed the brand for use in the United Kingdom and, in 1954, the first "Wimpy Bar" Lyons was established at the Lyons Corner House in Coventry Street, London. Originally the bar was a special fast-food section within the more traditional Corner House restaurants, but the success soon led to the establishment of separate Wimpy restaurants serving only hamburger-based meals. By 1970 the business had expanded to over a thousand restaurants in 23 countries.
In 1977, the business was acquired by United Biscuits. By the late 1980s, Wimpy was beginning to lose ground to McDonald’s, who had opened their first UK restaurant in 1974, and so the new management of Wimpy began to streamline the business by converting some of the traditional table service restaurants to counter service. In 1989, the business was sold to Grand Metropolitan (now Diageo). Grand Metropolitan had acquired Burger King the previous year and they began to convert the “counter service” restaurants to Burger King restaurants. In 1990, the remaining 220 “table service” restaurants were purchased by a management buy-out backed by 3i. A second management buy-out occurred in 2002.
Although Wimpy outlets have decreased in numbers in the UK, they are still found in many cities, and at seafront/seasonal locations such as Clacton-on-Sea, Clarence Pier in Southsea, Porthcawl Beach, Brean Leisure Park in Somerset and in two locations in Ryde on the Isle of Wight.
Wimpy is the only major fast food chain that offers Quorn burgers on the menu.
On 27 February 2007, Famous Brands, which owns the Wimpy franchise in South Africa, announced that it had acquired Wimpy UK. Having acquired the brand, Famous Brands has re-branded Wimpy in the UK, to bring it in line with Wimpy South Africa. The "new" logo is actually one used by Wimpy UK from the 1960s until the 1980s.
Wimpy has been re-branding and refreshing all its restaurants; the operation commenced on 22 October 2007, with the launch of the new format at the Benfleet, Essex branch. The opening day of the relaunch featured Geoffrey Hayes of the Rainbow television series, dressed as Mr Wimpy. Wimpy features new décor, seating and signage and a return to the original Wimpy colours of red and white. Supporting the new look is an improved menu and a significant marketing campaign.
Outside the United Kingdom.
Egypt and Morocco.
At one time Wimpy had many outlets in Egypt and Morocco. It was the first international burger restaurant chain in Egypt and Morocco's second, however by 1998 both were closed.
In Egypt there was a network which covered almost all districts in Cairo and Alexandria. The Mohandisseen outlet was owned and managed directly by the agent in Egypt.
Wimpy expanded in Egypt through signing several franchise contracts with Egyptian investors. These franchises included: 'Merryland' in Heliopolis, 'Pyramids', 'Shooting Club', 'Hoda Shaarawi', 'Talaat Harb', 'Nasser City', 'Manshyet El Bakry' and many others.
The Merryland branch in Heliopolis was founded by Raafat Sadek Zahran and his sons Bahaa El Din, Samir and Ahmed Raafat Zahran.
The branches of Huda Shaarawi in the downtown area and the Shooting Club branch in Giza were founded by Mostafa El-Shorbagi.
There is only one branch still functioning in Cairo, which is the Nasser City branch.
Saudi Arabia.
Wimpy opened its first chain in Saudi Arabia in the mid '70s. By the late '80s it became the most popular fast food chain in the nation. With the opening of the first McDonald's in 1994 Wimpy started to struggle and by 2006 the last branch had closed.
Finland.
Wimpy was the first fast-food restaurant to open in Finland in 1970s. It had three locations in Helsinki, all of them now closed.
Germany.
In the 1970s Wimpy also established about three dozen restaurants in different German cities named "Wimpy-Snack". The one in Hamburg was located on The Reeperbahn in the St.Pauli district. All of them are now closed.
India.
Wimpy was one of the first fast-food restaurants to open in India's post-liberalised economy. With a run of initial success, Wimpy was often touted as the first icon of 'westernization' in India. A few of the remaining restaurants still in business are in the Punjab, India.
Ireland.
Wimpy has been in Ireland on two occasions, in the 1960s and more recently in the early 2000s.
In the 2000s, petrol station chain operator Petrogas took on the master franchise for Ireland, and operated a large number of sites, but they have since ceased to operate them. Most have been replaced by "Grill'n'Fill" own-branded areas, selling virtually identical products, or Burger King, for which Petrogas now has a franchise.
Japan.
Wimpy was the first overseas fast-food chain to open in Japan; the first branch opened in 1970 in Shinsaibashi, Osaka. In 1992 Wimpy formed a business partnership with Russell's Restaurant Inc. to open a new Russell's chain of hamburger restaurants, but the company withdrew from Japan in 1998.
Kuwait.
Wimpy opened in Al-duiya in Kuwait in the 1970s. It is now only in Al-Nuzha, Kuwait.
New Zealand.
Wimpy had branches in New Zealand including Auckland, Hamilton, Paraparaumu and Taupo but have now closed. One store remained in Rotorua but this was put up for sale in 2008 and has since closed.
South Africa.
Wimpy opened in South Africa in Durban in 1967. The business was sold to Bakers SA Ltd in the late 1970s and later to Famous Brands Limited.
France.
Jacques Borel opened the first hamburger restaurant in 1961 in Paris. It was a Wimpy franchised restaurant. It closed in 1969.
Other countries.
In 1976, Wimpy opened their first restaurant in Colombia in Bogotá. Branches trading as Wimpy in Germany preceded the U.S. based chains. Other countries with Wimpy restaurants include Guatemala, Norway, Sweden, Lithuania, Kuwait, Egypt, Cyprus, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Lebanon (Beirut), India, Iran, Israel, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Botswana, Netherlands, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Japan.
Wimpy was the first international hamburger restaurant in Turkey, in the mid-80s. However, it lost ground to McDonalds and Pizza Hut restaurants opened in Taksim Square, Istanbul and had to shut down its only restaurant in this location.
In Canada, there is a hamburger chain, "Wimpy's diner" with locations in Ontario but under separate management.
In popular culture.
"Mr. Wimpy".
During the 1980s, advertising for the Wimpy chain featured a cartoon character called Mr. Wimpy. He was almost entirely hidden under a large hat, and only a nose and a smile were visible. His physical appearance was a visual pun, as his costume was the red dress uniform of the Beefeaters at the Tower Of London, playing on the beef-oriented nature of the chain's menu. In certain branches, a member of staff would dress up in a Mr. Wimpy costume for pre-arranged children's parties.
Mr. Wimpy also appeared in an official computer game by Ocean Software, released in 1984 on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and other formats.
Although the Wimpy chain's name was originally inspired by the Wimpy cartoon character in Popeye, the chain's own Mr. Wimpy bore no resemblance to Popeye's Wimpy.
The Dudley Moore character in the cult film "Bedazzled" (1967) works at a Wimpy Bar.
The Jethro Tull song "Up to Me" from the album "Aqualung" (1971) makes reference to a Wimpy Bar.
The X-Ray Spex song "The Day the World Turned Day-Glo" from the album "Germfree Adolescents" (1978) also refers to a Wimpy Bar in the lyrics.

Momokomotion

Momokomotion (Momoko Ueda) is a Japanese multi-instrumentalist/singer/songwriter/artist based in Bangkok and a well-known performer on the city’s indie scene.
History.
After attending the San Francisco Institute Of Arts, Momoko became a member of the Bangkok-based international electroclash band Futon (as Momoko Futon), with whom she recorded three albums before her departure in 2006.
In 2007, and now known as Momokomotion, she recorded her first solo album, "Punk In A Coma", an album of original compositions plus a ska version of the Nirvana song All Apologies for which she wrote Japanese lyrics. Japanese also features in some of her other songs, though she mainly writes in English. As well as writing the songs, she produced and arranged the album and played most of the instruments. 
In late 2007, Momoko Ueda and guitarist-artist Tintin Cooper took part in Tokyo Wonder Site's 'Creator in Residence' scheme in Shibuya, Tokyo while also performing for Tokyo DAF (Digital Arts Festival) in an art installation created by Bangkok-based design team Duckunit. Both artists lived together in a bohemian house called Cassette Cafe in Bangkok, renowned for wild parties and makeshift exhibitions, including international artists such as Adham Faramawy and Bea Camacho. A popular resident of the house, Kuro-jung, an orange Pomeranian dog even had his own Myspace page. Cassette Cafe remains listed in many Japanese guidebooks until this day, although the house has now become design group Duckunit's new office.
In January 2008, Momokomotion was the resident artist at Bangkok’s ultra-chic “Bed Supperclub”. Her next project was "Walk On The Wild Side", a musical tribute to Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground performed with fellow indie artist Gene Mahasamut.

Protection from Harassment Act 1997

The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (c 40) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which, among other things, criminalises and creates a right to protection from stalking and persistent bullying in the workplace. On introducing the Bill's second reading in the House of Lords the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern stated, "The aim of this Bill is to protect the victims of harassment. It will protect all such victims whatever the source of the harassment—so-called stalking behaviour, racial harassment, or anti-social behaviour by neighbours.". Infield and Platford described the Act as "controversial".
Provisions.
Section 1.
This section prohibits a person from pursuing "a course of conduct" which "amounts to harassment of another" and which "he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other". A person is taken to know that conduct is harassment if "a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct amounted to harassment of the other".
Section 1 (1A).
Section 1(1A) was inserted by section 125(2)(a) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. It prohibits a person from pursuing a course of conduct "which involves harassment of two or more persons" with the intention of persuading any person (not necessarily one of the persons harassed) to do or refrain from doing something they are lawfully entitled to do or not do.
According to Baroness Scotland of Ashall, promoting the Bill in the House of Lords, this provision and the associated provisions of section 3A were intended to strengthen "the protection afforded to the bioscience industry, and those who work in it" including by "making it an offence to protest outside a person's home in a way that causes harassment, alarm or distress to the residents of that home."
Section 2.
This section creates the offence of harassment, which is to pursue "a course of conduct" in breach of section 1 of the Act. It is a summary offence. A person guilty of this offence is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a to fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.
Section 2(3) was repealed by section 107 of, and Schedule 8 to, the Police Reform Act 2002.
Section 2A.
The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 did not originally define "stalking" or formally proscribe it.
This section creates a specific offence of stalking. It followed a commitment given by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, on 8 March 2012 (International Women's Day) to remedy perceived deficiencies in the Act.
The offence created by this section is a summary offence and a person guilty of it is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 51 weeks, or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both.
This section was inserted by section 111(1) of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.
Section 2B.
This section, which confers, on justices of the peace, a power to issue a search warrant to allow constables to enter and search premises for evidence of offences under section 2A, was inserted by section 112 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.
Section 3.
This section provides for a claim in civil proceedings (creating a statutory tort) by anyone who is or who may be a victim of conduct falling within section 1. It provides for damages for anxiety caused by the harassment and any financial loss it causes, as well as providing for an injunction to restrain the defendant from conduct amounting to harassment. Where any person against whom an injunction has been granted under this section does "without reasonable excuse" anything prohibited by that injunction, section 3(6) of the Act makes that person guilty of an offence.
Offences under section 3(6) are triable either way. A person guilty of an offence under section 3(6) is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.
Section 3A.
This section provides similar injunction provisions to those in section 3, but in this case applying to the offence created by section 1(1A). However, in addition to it allowing the person who is the victim or who may be the victim of the conduct in question to seek an injunction, it also gives a similar right to someone whose behaviour the harassment is intended to influence.
Section 3A was inserted by section 125(5) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.
Section 4.
This section creates the offence of "putting people in fear of violence" where a person "causes another to fear, on at least two occasions, that violence will be used against him" provided "he knows or ought to know that his course of conduct will cause the other so to fear on each of those occasions".
There are a number of defences. These include showing that the course of conduct is pursued for the "purpose of preventing or detecting crime" or "reasonable for the protection of himself or another or for the protection of his or another’s property."
In 2001, David Ormerod said that this section "could have been drafted more clearly all round".
Offences under section 4 are triable either way. A person guilty of an offence under section 4 is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.
Section 4A.
This section creates the offence of stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress. This requires there to be a person A whose "course of conduct ... amounts to stalking" and a person B who is affected by the course of conduct. The course of conduct must either cause B "to fear, on at least two occasions, that violence will be used against B" or causes B "serious alarm or distress which has a substantial adverse effect on B's usual day-to-day activities".
Offences under section 4A are triable either way. A person guilty of an offence under section 4A is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.
This section was inserted by section 111(2) of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.
Section 5.
This section gives a court dealing with a person convicted of an offence under sections 2 (harassment) or 4 (putting in fear of violence) of the Act the power to make a restraining order for the purpose of protecting "the victim of the offence" or "any other person mentioned in the order".
Offences under section 5 are triable either way. A person guilty of an offence under section 5 is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.
This section has effect in relation to a person convicted of an offence under section 32 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 as if the reference in subsection (1) of this section to an offence under section 2 or 4 included a reference to an offence under the said section 32.
Section 5(3A) was inserted by section 12(2) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.
Section 5(4A) was inserted by section 12(3) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.
Section 5(7) was inserted by section 12(4) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.
Section 5A.
This section provides for a court to impose a restraining order on someone who has been "acquitted" of an offence, if the court considers it necessary "to protect a person from harassment by the defendant".
This section was inserted by section 12(5) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.
Section 7.
This is the interpretation section. "Harassing" is defined (non-exclusively) as including "alarming" or "causing distress".
Section 7(3) was substituted by section 125(7)(a) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. It now provides that a "course of conduct" requires either conduct on at least two occasions in relation to one person, or, where the harassment is alleged against two or more occasions, conduct in relation to at least one occasion in relation to each person.
Section 7(3A) was inserted by section 44(1) of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.
Section 7(5) was inserted by section 125(7)(b) of the Serious Organised 
Crime and Police Act 2005.
Section 8.
Section 8 creates a civil action for harassment applying in Scotland only (sections 1-7 apply only in England and Wales).
Section 8A.
This section was inserted by section 1(2) of the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2011 (asp 13).
Section 15.
The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (Commencement) (No. 1) Order 1997 (SI 1997/1418) (C 52) was made under section 15(1).
The following orders were made under section 15(2):
Racially or religiously aggravated harassment.
Section 32 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 now provides that where a person commits an offence under section 2 or 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act which is "racially or religiously aggravated" within the meaning of section 28 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001) he is guilty of an offence triable either way. A person convicted on indictment of an offence falling within section 32(1)(a) of the 1998 Act (the racially or religiously aggravated version of the offence under section 2 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997) is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine, or to both. A person convicted on indictment of an offence falling within section 32(1)(b) of the 1998 Act (the racially or religiously aggravated version of the offence under section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997) is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or to a fine, or to both.
Definition.
The Act provides by section 7(3) that a course of conduct must involve conduct on at least two occasions. (Originally these occasions needed to involve the same person, but the Act was amended by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 so that "pursuing a course of conduct" could mean approaching two people just once.)
In England and Wales, the Act now creates offences of harassment, stalking, putting people in fear of violence, stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress, breach of injunction and breach of restraining order.
However, someone who believes they are the victim of harassment falling within section 1 of the Act may (either instead of or in addition to a criminal prosecution) elect to pursue a civil remedy for damages for anxiety or for financial loss arising from harassment: section 3(2). Section 3 creates a statutory tort based on the same acts as the criminal offence. An example of this tort in action appears in "Green v DB Group Services (UK) Ltd" EWHC 1898 QB (1 August 2006). which was a case of severe and prolonged workplace bullying resulting in serious illness of the claimant.
If a claimant elects to pursue the section 3 civil law remedy, the standard of proof which needs to be shown is the common law standard of proof on "the balance of probabilities" (more likely than not) rather than the standard for criminal law which is proof beyond reasonable doubt.
The requirement of a course of conduct shows that Parliament was conscious that it might not be in the public interest to allow the law to be set in motion for one boorish incident.
The editor of "Archbold" notes the Act does not attempt to define "harassment". In "Thomas v News Group Newspapers and Another" (2001), Lord Philips MR said: "'Harassment' is, however, a word which has a meaning which is generally understood. It describes conduct targeted at an individual which is calculated to produce the consequences described in section 7 and which is oppressive and unreasonable."
Section 7(2) of the Act provides that, for the purpose of the interpretation of sections 1 to 5A, references to harassing a person include alarming the person or causing the person distress.
Section 5 of the Act gives the court in criminal cases a power to grant restraining orders and section 5A, introduced by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, extends this power to cases where the defendant was acquitted, if the court "considers it necessary to do so to protect a person from harassment by the defendant.". The power to grant restraining orders was characterised as "the most important aspect of the Act" by practitioners interviewed in a Home Office research study (2000) into the effectiveness of the Act. The power to grant restraining orders is separate from and additional to the ability of claimants to seek injunctions in civil actions brought under section 3 of the Act. However, in each case the penalties for breach of a restraining order or an injunction are similar: on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or a fine, or both, or on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both.
The summary offences of harassment "cast the net too wide". The offence created by section 2 is "broad and ill-defined". Its scope is "quite enormous". It might well violate Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (in addition to Article 7 mentioned below). The Act contains no definition of "course of conduct" beyond the provisions of sections 7(3) and (4). Case law has established that "merely because there are two incidents between the same parties, this will not inevitably give rise to a course of conduct" and "the requirement of a nexus between the incidents appears an eminently sensible way in which to limit the potentially immense reach of the offence of harassment." In 2003, David Ormerod said that the "course of conduct" element defies definition.
Mens rea.
Constructive knowledge or actual knowledge is an element of the offences under sections 2, 2A, 4 and 4A; that is, the prosecution has to show that the defendant "knows or ought to know" that the course of conduct complained of has the prescribed effects on the person at whom it is directed. The test of "ought to know" is based on what "a reasonable person in possession of the same information" would think about the course of conduct in question. Section 4(2) "has an unusual type of "mens rea" with objective and subjective components."
Employers' liability.
Employers have vicarious liability for harassment by their employees under section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (see "Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust"). For employees this may provide an easier route to compensation than claims based on discrimination legislation or personal injury claims for stress at work, as the elements of harassment are likely to be easier to prove, the statutory defence is not available to the employer, and it may be easier to establish a claim for compensation. Also as the claim can be made in either the High Court or the County Court costs may be recoverable by the successful party, subject to relevant court rules and limits.
Number of prosecutions.
The Bill for this Act said that it was expected to result in about two hundred prosecutions a year. In 1998, there were nearly six "thousand" prosecutions. A written question, raised by a Member of Parliament in 2008 and relating to prosecutions under section 2 from the date of the Act to 2006, showed the numbers of persons proceeded against under section 2 remained fairly steady during the period (5,540 in 1999 of whom 2,753 were found guilty, 5,446 in 2006 of whom 3,768 were found guilty). A 2011 written question requesting information about prosecutions under section 2 during the period 2006-2009 showed 5,006 persons proceeded against during 2006-7 of whom 3,543 were found guilty, 4,940 proceeded against during 2007-8 of whom 3,650 were found guilty and 4,865 proceeded against during 2008-9 of whom 3,892 were found guilty.
Northern Ireland.
The Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 (SI 1997/1180) (NI 9) was made under paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland Act 1974 (as modified by section 13 of this Act) only for purposes corresponding to those of sections 1 to 7 and 12 of this Act.
Scotland.
In Scotland the Act works slightly differently:
History.
The Act resulted from the efforts of Evonne Leonora Von Heussen. A stalking victim herself, she launched the National Association for Victims of Stalking and Harassment (NASH) in 1993, when her then teen-age daughter was stalked by a dangerous character who was known to carry a knife. After Von Heussen found that she could get no help from the police, lawyers, or her local Member of Parliament she began researching anti-stalking laws in other countries. She opened a help line on which she eventually took tens of thousands of calls. She pursued each call with each victim's MP, and attracted a large amount of media attention. After several years of effort she persuaded the Home Office under Prime Minister John Major to take the issue on as a matter of government policy. She wrote the first draft of the Act and worked closely with ministers and senior civil servants in the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department as the final version took shape. She advised ministers from her seat in the Under Gallery, on the floor of the House of Commons, during the Second Reading Debate. After Royal Assent she worked with Home Office and Lord Chancellor's Department in training judges, lawyers, other court personnel, police and voluntary organizations in the use of the Act. She received the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List (1997) for her efforts. She also worked as a consultant on a number of court cases involving stalking and harassment.
The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 was preceded by the Stalking Bill.
Criticism.
The passing of this Act was "hasty". There was an "unseemly rush" to get the Bill for this Act through all of its stages in Parliament. This was the result of political agitation.
This Act is "unimpressive", "unsatisfactory", has "inadequacies" and has been called "a breach of human rights". A "better solution" is said to be needed. It is "unfortunate" that a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of five years has been applied to offences that can be committed through mere negligence.
Although some magistrates felt "criminalising harassment cases might lead to unfounded accusations from complainants who are mistaken about another’s behaviour or are even vindictive" magistrates and prosecutors agreed that "the difficulties in pursuing harassment cases were no greater than other kinds of case – such as domestic violence – where the parties are often well known to each other." 
In February 2012, the Rt Hon Elfyn Llwyd MP, chairing an Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into reform of stalking law, said the Act was "not an effective tool against stalking". "oo many perpetrators were falling through the net." The "attitudes of many working in the criminal justice system and society towards stalking remain in the dark ages."
Commentators such as George Monbiot have voiced the concern that the amended Act effectively "allows the police to ban any campaign they please", and that it has been used to prosecute peaceful protestors.
Drafting.
The drafting of this Act is "deficient". It is so bad that it might well violate Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Act is "deplorably vague".
Praise.
In February 2012, the Rt Hon Elfyn Llwyd MP, chairing an Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into reform of stalking law, said the Act was a "landmark piece of legislation".
The Act "is an effective weapon in the armoury of the victim of nuisance creditors." It is "a versatile and wide-ranging statute" and "one of the most flexible pieces of legislation of recent years."
This Act was initially "doing its job quite happily". Infield and Platford said that they did not agree with claims that this Act is a breach of human rights.

Ken Fleming (engineer)

Wilfred George Kenneth Fleming (known as Ken) was an influential piling engineer and former chairman of the Federation of Piling Contractors.
Early life and education.
Born in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh Ken Fleming was the son of a Church of Ireland minister.
In July 1945, he won the Seale Scholarship to Portora Royal School.
He graduated from Queen's University Belfast (1955) and became an assistant lecturer, later being awarded a PHD in 1958.

In 1958 Ken Fleming joined J. Laing and Sons (in Mill Hill, London, NW7). When Laing’s joined up to form McKinney Foundations, Fleming was involved as a technical advisor for the piling foundations for London's Centre Point. He also travelled to America where he spent time with company founder Jack McKinney who encouraged his interest in developing improved piling techniques.
McKinney Foundations was bought by Cementation Foundations in 1968 and Ken Fleming became chief engineer. At Cementation, Fleming was involved in the development of a series of new systems for improving the receptiveness of the ground to secure piles and to provide reliable information on the settlement of piles. Ken Fleming created the “Cemset” system which forecasts pile settlement under load.
He became chairman of the Federation of Piling Contractors, and in 1975 chairman and founder member of the Federation of Piling Specialists.
In 1985 he was the lead author of Piling Engineering, which has become an industry standard reference book. The third edition of Piling Engineering, still containing much of Fleming's original material, published in September 2008.
Fleming influenced European piling through the European Federation of Foundation Contractors. He disagreed with parts of the Eurocode EC7. Among other objections he believed it had fundamental technical flaws in relation to pile testing.
The British Standards Institution awarded Fleming it’s Distinguished Service award in 1992. In 1999 the British Geotechnical Society honoured him with the prestigious Skempton Medal for his lifelong contribution to geotechnical engineering.
In 2000 the British Geotechnical Association joined with Cementation (now part of Skanska) to mark Fleming's contribution to geotechnical engineering by inaugurating the Fleming Award. This international award is presented annually for excellence in geotechnical design and construction.
A visiting Professor at Queen's University Belfast, Fleming was also a prominent figure in the Institution of Civil Engineers.

<doc id="18758481" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18758481" title="Il Fornaio">
Il Fornaio

Il Fornaio is a chain of twenty-one (as of 2014) Italian-themed fine dining restaurants operating primarily in California (16 locations of its 21) in the United States. 
History.
The Il Fornaio brand was established in 1972 as a baking school in Barlassina, Italy (in the Lombardia region). It opened a retail bakery in Milan in 1975, and was licensed in 1981 to Williams-Sonoma as a retail bakery concept. Williams-Sonoma opened four locations in California before selling the business to private investors in 1983. Initially unsuccessful, the chain was re-sold in 1986 to Larry Mindel, who had run local restaurant holding company Spectrum Foods and launched or bought a series of successful restaurants: Chianti in Los Angeles; Prego (one of the originators of California-style pizza), MacArthur Park, and Ciao in San Francisco; and Guyamas in Tiburon.
The new owners opened a total of 11 restaurant-bakeries in California in late 1980s and 1990s. The first restaurant location and headquarters are in Corte Madera, California, the second in San Francisco. They then branched out to Las Vegas, Nevada, Colorado, and Virginia, opening a total of 22 by 2008.
In 1997 the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. By 2000 the company had $124 million annual revenues. The company was eventually taken private again in a leveraged buyout. Mindel sold most of his equity and retired from daily operations of the group in 2001 (his son, Michael, continued and was Vice President of Marketing as of 2008), and in 2003 opened Poggio at the Casa Madrona Hotel in Sausalito as a personal project. Headquarters is in Corte Madera, California.
Under the direction of Executive Chef Maurizio Mazzon, a native of Venice, the company launched a second concept, Canaletto Ristorante Veneto, at the Venetian in Las Vegas in 1999, with a second location in 2008 in Fashion Island shopping mall in Newport Beach, California.
Roark Capital Group bought the company in 2011.
Description.
Each restaurant features a bakery that bakes its own bread. There is a core menu for all of the restaurants created collectively by their chefs, plus signature dishes and specials at the discretion of each chef. In addition, the group markets ciabatta, sourdough, and other bread to supermarkets throughout California.
Overall, the company caters mostly to repeat guests and does not market extensively. Regular customers averaged 12.7 return visits per year (later reported to be 17), considered very high in the industry. The company is known for its long-running "Festa Regionale" loyalty program promotion Two weeks out of every month the restaurants promote dishes from a rotating schedule of Italy's 20 food regions with a special insert. The 10,000 promotion members receive a "passport stamp" from that region if they order one of the items, and those who collect each stamp receive a gift. As an unintended benefit, the promotion became a vehicle for recruiting cooks and chefs, after tourism offices in Italy noticed the promotion and established relationships with the company.

Guru Vandana

Guru Vandana means “Reverence for the Teacher” – it is the thanksgiving from a student to a teacher, expressing his or her gratitude. The Guru Vandana program provides a platform for students to honor their teachers for imparting knowledge and wisdom to them.
GURU.
The concept of Guru is as old as humanity itself. Primarily, the word Guru means a 'teacher' and as such it is a universal concept based on the idea of transmitting knowledge from a person, who knows something, to an ignorant student or disciple. In an extended view, a Guru can also be a priest, a rabbi, a master, a school teacher, even a father or a mother.
Guru does not mean a teacher imparting formal training but a person who contributes to the overall development and learning of an individual.
Guru transforms his disciple through his presence and spiritual knowledge. According to RamaKrishna Prarahamsa Spiritual knowledge can not be attained completely by reading books. But for obtaining complete spiritual enlightenment Guru’s presence is a must. Only when there is a strong bond between Guru and Shishya spiritual enlightenment might takes place.
Origins of Guru Shishya Parampara
Thus our great sanathana darma tradition has been enriched by the GURU-SISHYA relationship. Lord Rama's greatness lay in His relationship with His most loyal disciple HANUMAN who taught the essence of Ramanamamritim. Lord Krishna gave us the Bhagavad Gita, thanks to his devoted and most trusted disciple Arjuna. Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa gave to the world Swami Vivekananda who in turn gave to the world the Ramakrishna Mission, embodying the soul of India. Saint Thyagaraja, an avatar of Sage Valmiki, composed hundreds of soulful Krithis in praise of God. Two Krithis, in particular, refer to the GURU'S role in guiding the seeker on the right path. Guru leka in 'Gowrimanohari' raga is a Krithi in which the Saint of Thiruvaiyar sings how one who is trapped in the jungle of desire, can come out of it with help of the right Guru. Saint Thyagaraja says however learned and good a person might be, life would be meaningless without the guidance of a Satguru. In another Krithi, Sri Naradamuni Gururaya ganti in Bhairavi raga, Thyagaraja explains how Satguru Smaranam helps one in getting rid of ignorance.
In modern times.
American Hindu Education Foundation (HEF) had conducted the program in Houston in which over 30 teachers and a principal were honored by students. Children from Houston Balagokulams area picked up their favorite teachers. Acharya Premchand Sridhar of Arya Samaj Houston presided over the program. The program started with Sridhar lighting the lamp and it was followed by cultural programs and with the explanation of Hindu Concept of Gurus. After the felicitation of teachers Veda Vrinda group chanted the section of the Taittariya Upanishad known as the Vedic Commencement Address. Columbus chapter of HEF is planning to conduct similar program in October 2008.
Guruvandana is also performed by disciples to spiritual masters. During GuruVandana program GuruGita is recited by disciple to honor his guru. GuruGita forms section of Skanda Purana. In Bangalore Guruvandana was offered to Sankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, Sri Jayendra Saraswathi. Despite rains lots of people gathered in Malleshwaram to felicitate their Spiritual Guru. In ISKCON temples Guruvandana is performed for spiritual Guru Srila Prabhupada throughout the year.
In other religions.
Apart from Hinduism Guru-Shishya concept is followed in other religions like Jain, Sikh, Buddhism. In fact the word Sikh has origins from Sanskrit 'shishya'. Jains celebrate Guru Vandana as part of their rituals.

João da Silva Feijó

João da Silva Barbosa or João da Silva Feijó, (1760 Rio de Janeiro – 1824), was a naturalist, mineralogist and Portuguese soldier, born in Brazil. 
João da Silva Feijó studied philosophy and mathematics at the University of Coimbra and adopted the name Feijó in homage to Benito Jerónimo Feijoo, Spanish philosopher, who at the time was respected among natural history students. 
In 1778, the Italian professor, Domenico Agostino Vandelli, was part of a group that founded the Natural History Museum in Lisbon. João da Silva was part of this group with Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, Manuel da Silva Galvão and Joaquim José da Silva.
The feijoa, a tree that bears green fruits similar to guavas, is named after him.
Cape Verde.
Beginning in 1783, scientific voyages under Vandelli were launched. Naturalists were to plan expeditions to various colonies. Feijó arranged to explore the islands of the archipelago of Cape Verde, and arrived there in June 1783. Like his colleagues, he had great difficulty in pursuing his research as an independent man of science. The activities of a young naturalist, who observes and collects objects such as butterflies, plants, shells and minerals, are often regarded with contempt by colonial officials.
He described his exploration of Cape Verde in seven letters sent to the minister Martinho de Mello e Castro and discusses the geography, topography and flora of the island.
The work of Feijó disappointed his sponsor Mello e Castro, who criticized the packaging of shipments and paucity of material sent. It was regretted that Feijó has not proposed any method of exploiting the saltpetre and sulphur which was believed to be readily available in the volcanic regions of Cape Verde.
In 1790, Feijó joined the local military establishment and soon requested that he be allowed to return to Portugal.
In Lisbon, Feijó collaborated with his old friend Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, newly returned from the Amazon, to produce herbarium specimens from the Cape Verde material. The German naturalist Heinrich Friedrich Link, visiting Portugal between 1797 and 1799, met his Brazilian colleagues and praised their work.
In 1797, Feijó rewrote some of the text relating to Cape Verde and published a work titled ""Itinéraire philosophique"".

Sardis Road

Sardis Road is a rugby union stadium situated in Pontypridd, Wales. It is home to the Principality Premiership team, Pontypridd RFC and previously the Celtic Warriors, the now defunct regional rugby union team. It is commonly known as the "House of Pain".
History.
Pontypridd RFC originally played their games at Taff Vale Park in Treforest, later they moved to the People's Park before finally moving to the Sardis Road ground. It was officially opened in September 1974 and currently holds 7,861 spectators. 
It has been host to Argentina verses Western Samoa in the 1991 Rugby World Cup in which Argentina lost 12–35.
The former Celtic Warriors used Sardis Road between 2003–2004, however with their demise, Pontypridd RFC have become a semi-professional club and Sardis Road has been mooted as being too big for the crowds that attend their matches. A planning application for a retail store on the Sardis Road ground was turned down by the National Assembly for Wales. The owners of Sardis Road, Ponty Rugby Limited had hoped to sell the ground to a property developer, Morbaine Limited. It was envisaged that a new 3,000 seater stadium would be funded from the sale of the Sardis Road ground.
In 2009, Sardis Road hosted the Wales versus Ireland rugby league semi-final of the European Cup.

Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green

(Tales of) Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green was a comic strip in the comic The Beano. It first appeared in Beano issue 3404, dated 27 October 2007. It is the first Beano comic strip ever to be regularly drawn by a female artist. The strip's artist is Laura Howell, who also pens and has subsequently taken over outright Hunt Emerson's "Ratz", and has also drawn one Minnie the Minx and one Les Pretend strip.
The strip focused on the title character, and his attempts to terrorize the citizens of his village, Happy Bunny Green, in a less extroverted, but more cunning way than that of Dennis the Menace. The citizens include Mr. Garden, his neighbour, Mrs. Garden, his wife, Mr. Baker the butcher and Mr. Butcher the baker, who are sworn enemies. He has a penchant for amazing ruthlessness. In one strip, he shows a cow a picture of a beefburger during a Cowpat Lottery (in which a cow has to defecate on a villager's selected square). In the Beano Annual 2009, he hijacks an anthropomorphic train, injures the driver, drives it dangerously, and eventually destroys it (a parody of Thomas the Tank Engine).The early stories featured a narrator, who spoke in a heavily sugar-coated way, but he disappeared during 2008.
His strip continued to appear regularly in the Beano until autumn 2009, when Laura Howell started drawing Beano Manga. As she was already drawing Ratz for the comic, Johnny's appearances became increasingly infrequent. He later made a return as a regular before the strip ended in 2010, after Laura Howell's strip Meebo and Zuky won that year's Comic Idol contest.

Generation Dead

Generation Dead is a young adult supernatural romance novel by Daniel Waters. The book is a modern reworking of the zombie genre of fiction. It follows a girl named Phoebe and her best friends, Margi and Adam, whose world has been left baffled by a strange phenomenon – dead teenagers not staying dead. For reasons unknown, a small number of the teenaged dead are returning to 'life'. They lack a heartbeat and all other traditional life-signs (respiration, digestion, etc.) but are capable of thought, movement and speech (to varying extents). They are widely feared by the living, but Phoebe finds herself attracted to Tommy Williams, one of the "living impaired" teens at her school.
Plot summary.
The protagonist of the story is goth teenager Phoebe Kendall who, along with her best friends Margi and Adam, attends the fictional Oakvale High School. The world in which the story takes place is a strange one, with a supernatural phenomenon that causes dead teenagers to wake from their graves and move about like regular people—except they don't breathe.
With help from the school's principal, Tommy joins Oakvale High's football team. The coach is openly hostile towards him and instructs the other players (in particular Pete, his lackeys Stavis and Harris, and Adam) to do their utmost to injure him so severely that he can no longer play. Adam refuses, and Pete and the others fail. Adam and another living boy, Thornton Harrowood, come to accept Tommy, but when the team plays their first match, they are harassed by anti-zombie protestors. Tommy bargains with the coach, promising to quit as long as he can play, however briefly, in the second half of the game.
The school is also visited by the Hunter Foundation, which aims to promote tolerance and understanding of the living impaired. Founders Alish and Angela Hunter announce a work and study program open to all students, intended to improve relations between traditionally and differently biotic people. Phoebe, Margi, Adam and Thornton are the only living students to sign up for the class (affectionately referred to as 'Undead Studies'), along with their differently biotic classmates Tommy, Karen, Evan, Colette, Kevin, Sylvia and Tayshawn. When the class list is posted publicly in the school, Pete steals it, planning to go after each of the class members in turn.
It is revealed that Pete's first love, a girl called Julie, died suddenly of an asthma attack some time ago and did not 'come back'. As a result of this, he harbours a deep bitterness and hatred for all differently biotic people, believing them to be unworthy of the second chance that Julie was denied. His mental stability is uncertain, since he sees hallucinations of Julie semi-frequently and often refers to Karen and Phoebe as 'Julie' by mistake.
Tommy takes Phoebe and Adam to an abandoned house deep in the nearby Oxoboxo Woods. A number of the living impaired who were abandoned by their families reside there and refer to it as 'The Haunted House'. Tommy takes Phoebe upstairs and shows her the 'Wall of the Dead' - a wall of photographs of zombie kids from all over the country. He then tells her to lie down on the floor in the darkness. When she does, he leaves her there for a short time. She becomes frightened and Tommy later tells her that now she knows how it feels to be dead.
Tommy invites Phoebe to his house so he can show her his blog on a website called mysocalledundeath.com, which he uses to get in touch with other undead teenagers and to campaign for rights for the living impaired. Phoebe, knowing that her parents will disapprove of her associating with a dead boy, asks Adam and Margi to cover for her. It has been established by now that Adam has feelings for Phoebe and is unhappy about her developing relationship with Tommy, but he agrees. He and Margi visit the Oxoboxo Lake, where Colette drowned a few years earlier. When she was alive, Colette was best friends with Phoebe and Margi (the three of them being collectively known as 'The Weird Sisters') but they haven't spoken since her death, which is a source of constant guilt and misery for Margi.
Soon after in Undead Studies, Colette tells the class about her experiences following her return from death. She walked seven miles from the morgue to her family home, where her mother screamed at her to go away and her father threatened her with a shovel. (The family later left Oakvale without Colette.) She then went to a friend's house but was turned away again. Margi bursts into tears and protests that she was scared, ultimately revealing that this 'friend' was her. She runs out of the class, whilst Phoebe stays and reconciles with Colette. Margi later refuses to return to the class and is removed from the program.
Meanwhile, all over the country, undead teenagers are being brutally 'reterminated' (i.e. killed permanently, which involves the irreparable destruction of the brain). There are no laws against murdering zombies since they are, technically, already dead. Furthermore, since the differently biotic are widely shunned by living society, the stories of their murders do not even make it into the news. Tommy is constantly doing research into the crimes against the undead, and presents his findings at each meeting of the Undead Studies class. Many of the reterminations seem to involve a mysterious 'white van', suggesting that the killings are planned and systematic. Phoebe and the other living students are horrified, whilst the undead members of the class are unsurprised and seem quite aware that many people would like to see them destroyed.
Phoebe and Tommy finally go out on a date and see a movie, after which Tommy asks her to the homecoming dance. He tells her she doesn't have to answer straight away, though she later says yes.
Pete makes his first move against the members of the Undead Studies class. His first target is Evan Talbot, a red-headed zombie with a sense of humour that Adam is fond of. Pete, with help from Stavis and Harris, reterminates Evan using a maul. Adam, who was aware of the threats Pete was making towards the living impaired kids, suspects he is the perpetrator, and Pete indirectly confirms his suspicions.
Tommy arranges a meeting at the Haunted House to discuss Evan's murder. There, Phoebe and Adam meet Takayuki, a dead boy with a large section of his right cheek missing (leading to Adam nicknaming him 'Smiley') and a marked dislike for the living. When Adam reveals that it was Pete who killed Evan, Tommy announces that they will go to the police with the information. Takayuki is disgusted by this, believing that the police will do nothing, and he and a few other zombies leave. Tommy and Karen then announce their plans to host a party at the Haunted House after homecoming, since many of the undead kids will be unable to attend the dance. Phoebe feels that Adam was being rude and insensitive at the meeting, especially to Takayuki, and they have their first argument.
On the school bus the next day, Margi tells Phoebe that she is coming back to Undead Studies. Colette approaches them; Margi apologises to her and Colette invites her to the homecoming party at the Haunted House. Later, Margi and Phoebe ask Karen how she died and she tells them, to their shock, that she committed suicide by taking an overdose.
The homecoming dance seems to go smoothly, but unbeknownst to Phoebe and the others, Pete's next target is Tommy, and he plans on attacking him at the after-party (which he found out about by bullying the information out of Thornton). He and Stavis (it is mentioned that Harris, after assisting in Evan's murder, has refused to be part of Pete's schemes any longer) follow the group to the Haunted House. Tommy and Phoebe go outside into the woods to talk. Tommy tells her that he died in a car crash that also killed his father, and reveals that the zombies with the highest level of functionality are the ones who are loved by their friends or families even after their deaths. (This explains why zombies like Colette, who was abandoned by her family and, until recently, ignored by her friends, move and speak so slowly.) Tommy states his belief that if he can get a living girl to fall in love with him and kiss him, he'll come 'back to life' even more. Phoebe has been concerned for a while that Tommy is only interested in her because she is alive, and this seems to confirm her fears.
Pete, who has been watching them, is gripped by a hallucination – instead of Phoebe, he sees Julie, and believes that she is about to cheat on him with Tommy. He is armed with a gun, which he intended to use to shoot Tommy, but instead takes aim at Phoebe.
Meanwhile, back at the party, Karen advises Adam to tell Phoebe how he feels about her. He goes to find her and hears her screams. Following the sound, he sees Pete about to shoot. Without hesitation, he throws himself into the line of fire and is shot in the chest. Realizing what they've done, Stavis and Pete flee the scene. Pete is caught by Takayuki, who inflicts an injury on Pete's face similar to his own.
The screams and gunshot alert the rest of the party-goers to the confrontation, and everyone emerges from the Haunted House and gathers around Adam while Phoebe cries out at them to help, though she knows that Adam is already dead. However, within minutes he returns from death, and is at first completely unaware that he was killed. He realizes something is wrong when he tries to talk and move as normal and finds he can't, and then Phoebe tells him what happened. He tries to tell her that he loves her, but manages only an incoherent gurgle. When the police and an ambulance finally arrive, Phoebe decides that she is going to do everything in her power to bring Adam back as much as possible.
Sequel.
Two sequels to the novel, "Kiss of Life" and "Passing Strange", have been released in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

Diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply

Most forms of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) can be either powered by battery or flywheel energy. These are ready for immediate use at the instant that the mains electricity fails, but the small amount of stored energy they contain makes them suitable for a few seconds or minutes of use only. To get uninterruptible and continuous power supply, a diesel-generator back-up system is needed.
Diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply devices (DRUPS) combine the functionality of a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS and a diesel generator. When mains electricity supply is within specification, an electrical generator with a mass functions as motor to store kinetic energy in an electro-mechanical flywheel. In combination with a reactor or choke coil, the electrical generator also works as active filter for all sorts of power quality problems, like harmonics, RFI, and frequency variations. When mains electricity supply fails, stored energy in the flywheel is released to drive the electrical generator, which continues to supply power without interruption. At the same time (or with some delay, for example 2 to 11 seconds, to prevent the diesel engine from starting at every incident), the diesel engine takes over from the flywheel to drive the electrical generator to make the electricity required. The electro-magnetic flywheel can continue to support the diesel generator in order to keep a stable output frequency. Typically a DRUPS will have enough fuel to power the load for days or even weeks in the event of failure of the mains electricity supply.
The main advantages of DRUPS equipment compared to battery-powered UPS combined with a diesel-generator are the higher overall system energy efficiency, smaller footprint, use of fewer components, longer technical lifetime (no use of power electronics) and the fact it does not result in chemical waste (no use of batteries).

Kaiser Wilderness

The Kaiser Wilderness is a federally designated wilderness protected area located northeast of Fresno in the state of California, USA. It was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System by the United States Congress on October 19, 1976. The wilderness is in size, is one of five wilderness areas within the Sierra National Forest and is managed by the US Forest Service. 
The Kaiser Wilderness stretches along an east-west ridge and is separated from the High Sierra by the South Fork San Joaquin River canyon. It is a miniature version of the Sierra, with elevations from to at Kaiser Peak, and is composed of glacier-scoured granite blocks, cirques, lakes, granitic cliffs and alpine peaks. Although a small wilderness, it is part of the almost contiguous federal wilderness areas along the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range with the John Muir Wilderness on the east, and Ansel Adams Wilderness to the northeast. Immediately south is Huntington Lake, a well-developed resort area.
The forest consists of white fir, Jeffrey pine, red fir, western white pine, and mountain hemlock. On Kaiser Ridge there are stands of lodgepole pine, and at timberline whitebark pine and Sierra juniper grow in mats of krummholtz. Willows and alders grow along the perennial streams that form the drainage area of the South Fork of the San Joaquin River.
Some of the popular lakes in the Kaiser Wilderness are Nellie Lake, George Lake, and Upper Twin Lake, with Upper Twin Lake having a cave where the outlet stream disappears into and then flows underground for several hundred yards before resurfacing.
Recreational activities include day hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, rock scrambling, nature photography and snowshoeing. A wilderness permit is required for overnight trips into the Kaiser Wilderness. The Forest Service encourages the practice of Leave No Trace principles of outdoor travel to minimize human impact on the environment.

Contemporary romance

Contemporary romance is a subgenre of romance novels, generally with the setting after World War II. The largest of the romance novel subgenres, contemporary romance novels are set in the time when they were written, and usually reflect the mores of their time. Heroines in the contemporary romances written prior to 1970 usually quit working when they married or had children, while those novels written after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career. As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's fiction has blurred.
Most contemporary romance novels contain elements that date the books, and the majority of them eventually become irrelevant to more modern readers and go out of print. Over half of the romantic fiction published in the United States in 2004 (1468 out of 2,285 books) were contemporary romance novels. Contemporary romance novels have twice been chosen by Kelly Ripa to be featured in her Reading with Ripa book club.
Subgenres.
Contemporary romance novels may, in turn, be categorized into several subgenres, sometimes mixing with other main subgenres of romance novels.
Subgenres include:
Baby love.
This subgenre includes pregnancy, babies or children. One obstacle for making plots in this sense is to adapt to an ongoing increase in women who independently foster their children without any partner.
Highly notable examples include Nobody's Baby But Mine by Susan Elizabeth Phillips.
Medical romance.
Medical romance novels may generally be regarded as a subcategory of contemporary romance, as well as of medical fiction, but has its own type of setting and characters, although it yet can be as multifarious as any other subgenre. The setting usually involves a medical workplace, often the emergency department, but also airborne medicine, family medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology.
Regarding characters, the central male protagonists (heroes) are almost always medical doctors, mostly emergency physicians, primary care physicians or surgeons, and sometimes obstetricians/neonatologists or pediatricians. The female protagonists (heroines) are mostly medical doctors but also often nurses, working in primary care, obstetrics/neonatology, training or residency programs, surgery, anesthesiology or emergency medicine. The doctors are almost always ingenious, the male ones usually being tallish, husky and chiseled, while nurses are strong but caring.
Patients bring a lot of potential for subplots. They mostly get completely recovered, regardless of the severity of their injury or disease. Almost no plot, however, includes a doctor-patient or nurse-patient relationship, since it is a code for professional health care workers to avoid intimate relationships with patients, as a part of a professional doctor-patient relationship.
The plot often includes pregnancy and children.
The reality in the medical field, however, is generally far from as romantic as depicted in this subcategory of fiction.

FV Illertissen

FV Illertissen is a German association football club from the town of Illertissen, Bavaria and was established in 1921. Despite its location in Bavaria the club had never played in the league system of its home state but instead preferred to play in neighbouring Baden-Württemberg. At the end of the 2011-12 season the club however decided to switch to Bavaria.
__TOC__
History.
Although the town of Illertissen is in Bavaria, its proximity to other towns in the neighbouring state of Baden-Württemberg has allowed it to participate in that state's competition. In 1963, it became the first Bavarian team to win the Württembergischen-Pokal (Württemberg Cup) when they defeated "SV Hussenhofen".
The club has played as a lower division side for most of its history. It won promotion to the Landesliga Württemberg I (VI) in 1979 and played there until 1987. After slipping briefly into the Bezirksliga (VII), the club returned to the Landesliga, and in 2003 advanced for the first time to the Verbandsliga.
A rivalry exists with "Spvgg Au", which is in the same district as Illertissen. After several years playing against each other in the Verbandsliga Württemberg (V), both teams were promoted to the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg (V) in 2008. "Au" had some seasons earlier become the first Bavarian side to play in Baden-Württemberg and "Illertissen" followed its rival. The club qualified for the Oberliga through a promotion round playoff, alongside "Kehler FV".
In December 2011 the club decided to switch to the Bavarian league system from the 2012–13 season onwards. The reason for the switch was the introduction of the Regionalliga Bayern, which the club only needed to finish ninth or better in 2011–12 to qualify for. A fourth place in the Oberliga in 2011-12 allowed the club to qualify for the new Regionalliga. In the 2012–13, in the Regionalliga, the club finished in third place and, as the best placed non-reserve team in the league, qualified for the first round of the German Cup.

Betsy Aardsma

Betsy Aardsma (July 11, 1947 – November 28, 1969) was a 22-year-old graduate English major from Holland, Michigan, who was murdered in the "Stacks" area of Pattee Library at the Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA in 1969. 
Aardsma was in the library on November 28, 1969, doing research for a paper. At some point between 4:45 PM and 4:55 PM, she was stabbed a single time through the heart with a knife. She fell and a minute or so later one or two men exited the central region of the library, telling a desk clerk that "Somebody better help that girl" as they left. The man or men who spoke to the desk clerk have never been identified. Bystanders rendered first aid, including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to Aardsma and a call was placed to the campus hospital, the Ritenour Health Center, at 5:01 PM. By 5:19 PM, an ambulance had transported Aardsma to the Health Center, where she was pronounced dead a short time later.
After Aardsma was stabbed, the wound produced only a small amount of visible blood. Also, Aardsma was wearing a red dress at the time. As result of these two facts, the first responders thought that perhaps she had experienced a seizure or some other medical ailment. It was not until Aardsma was examined at the Health Center that anyone realized that she had been stabbed.
The murder of Betsy Aardsma has remained unsolved for 44 years as of November 2013 and the Pennsylvania State Police are still actively seeking information on the case.
In 1990, Pamela West, an author who had researched the case in the 1980s, wrote a book called "20/20 Vision," which was a science-fiction story based on the details of the case. West stated that she had originally intended to write a true crime story, but was concerned with libel issues related to the fact that so many people involved were still alive at the time. A 2011 book about the case, "Who Killed Betsy? Uncovering Penn State University's Most Notorious Unsolved Crime," purports to reveal the killer's identity.

Avui (, meaning "Today") is a Catalan daily newspaper, based in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain). It is one of the city's newest papers, having been founded in 1976. The editorial line is Catalan nationalist.
History.
The newspaper was founded on 23 April 1976, (Saint George's day, a symbolic holiday in Catalonia). It initially relied on the subscriptions of thousands of Catalans for financial support. It soon went into financial problems and changed ownership. A partnership of two publishers along with the Catalan regional government itself took over in order to avoid imminent bankruptcy. 
Then it went to change hands again in 2009, being bought by its rival El Punt. 
The Catalan government subsidises with important amounts those Catalan newspapers with at least one Catalan language edition. In 2008 Avui was only second to El Punt in terms of circulation/funds granted, having received almost 1.5 million euros that amounted to 48.9 euros per newspaper sold.

Sandy Stewart (producer)

Andrew "Sandy" Stewart (22 February 1930 – 5 August 1998) was a Canadian television producer and writer. He was the producer of "Reach for the Top", a high school quiz competition that continues today.
Early life and career.
Sandy Stewart was born in Calgary, and in his childhood moved to Montreal and London, Ontario. His first job was as a technician at London's CFPL radio in 1948. He joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1952 with the Toronto outlet, and had a posting in the Northwest Territories. He later moved to television and helped with the production of "Razzle Dazzle" and "The Friendly Giant".
"Reach for the Top".
Stewart brought "Reach for the Top", a televised quiz show for high school students, to a national audience in 1966, bringing teams from Vancouver, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto, and Ottawa to Montreal for a national final. When Stewart needed a new host for the show he selected a young CBC announcer named Alex Trebek who would later become famous as the host of the long running "Jeopardy". Stewart would produce "Reach for the Top" until 1985, when it was cancelled by the CBC. He retained some rights to "Reach for the Top", however, and continued to run a school-based version until his retirement in 1995. His final year was marred by job action in Ottawa that led Ontario schools to threaten to boycott the tournament if a team from Bell High School was allowed to participate.
Other pursuits.
Stewart served as president of the Canadian Science Writers' Association and held regular dinner lectures up until his death in 1998. He wrote "Here's Looking at Us", a book about Canadian television. He also wrote a strong criticism of CBC management during cuts to English programming in the 1990s.

Now Those Days Are Gone

"Now Those Days Are Gone" is a single by UK pop group Bucks Fizz. It became a UK top ten hit in July 1982 and featured on the group's album "Are You Ready".
Background.
Written by Andy Hill and Nichola Martin and produced by Hill, this was the group's only single to feature member Mike Nolan on lead vocals, it was also the last to be co-written by Martin, who founded the group. The song was a stark contrast to the group's singles up to this point, which had all featured very full pop productions, this time, the song was partly an a cappella piece with soft harmonies and a gentle orchestral build towards the end. One reviewer remarked that the impressive vocal structure would give Bucks Fizz some much-needed credibility. 
The song centres around the narrator who looks back on younger days and recalls how innocent he was then, and reflects on the love he once felt for his partner. The promotional video for the song saw the group in a World War II setting, with Nolan as a radio singer and members Bobby G, Cheryl Baker and Jay Aston being caught in a love triangle. Much of the video was filmed in Hyde Park, London. The single sleeve's cover shot was taken at the group's publicist, Jenny Halsall's manor house in Cambridge.
Released in June 1982, this single followed up two No.1 hits, "My Camera Never Lies" and "The Land Of Make Believe" and reached No.8 in the UK Charts. It remained on the chart for nine weeks and earned a silver disc for sales of over 250,000. It performed even better in Ireland, where it reached No.5. The following year, "Now Those Days Are Gone" received an Ivor Novello nomination for best song of 1982 - an award Andy Hill would go on to win years later with Celine Dion's "Think Twice". 
In Australia and many European countries, this single went unreleased, with tracks, "Are You Ready" or "Easy Love" being released in its place. The song was featured on the group's second (and most popular) album, "Are You Ready." It was also later featured as the B-Side to "You and Your Heart so Blue" - a 1985 single by the group. The B-Side to "Now Those Days Are Gone", "Takin' Me Higher" was a first, in that it was written and produced by the group themselves. The group continued to write and produce songs for their B-Sides over the next few years. 
A newly recorded version of "Now Those Days Are Gone" was released in 2006 on the Bucks Fizz album, "The Lost Masters," while an early demo by Hill was released in 2008 on "The Lost Masters 2 - The Final Cut". This demo featured an expletive, which necessitated the album to include a Parental advisory sticker.

Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901

The Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901 was a field gun designed and built by the German company "Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik" and sold to Norway in 1901. It remained the main field artillery gun of the Norwegian Army until the German invasion of Norway in 1940. The Germans impressed the surviving guns and used them in Norway for the duration of the Second World War. They equipped German units in Norway and were used as coastal artillery guns; a number were even modified for use as anti-tank guns. A dozen guns were transferred by the Norwegian government to Finland during the Winter War and were used by them during the Continuation War as well.
The Model 1901 guns were obsolescent already during the inter-war period and were retired from active use by the Norwegians shortly after the end of the Second World War. Model 1901s are still employed as saluting guns at fortresses in Norway.
Background.
Swedish-Norwegian artillery committee.
With the background of the rapid development of the artillery arm in the late 19th century and the invention of the quick-firing field gun, a Swedish-Norwegian artillery committee was established in 1899. The committee was to facilitate the procurement of new artillery for the Swedish and Norwegian armed forces. The new weapon was to solve the old time-consuming problem of the gun being pushed out of position by recoil with each shot. The committee consisted of six officers, three Swedish and three Norwegian. One of the Norwegian officers was Captain Georg Stang, the future Norwegian Minister of Defence in 1900–1902 and 1902–1903.
The Swedish-Norwegian committee reached only a single conclusion; that the calibre of the new weapon was to be 7.5 centimetres, based on tests with a French Schneider-Canet Model 1898 field gun. Four Schneider-Canet had been delivered to Norway at that time, and 16 more were on order. While the Swedish members of the committee wished for a conclusion to be reached in the shortest possible time, the Norwegians wished to bide their time and study the issue to the fullest. The reason for the Norwegians' lack of haste was probably that breech-loaded rifled guns had been introduced to the Norwegian Army only in 1887, and with the last of the Krupp 8.4 cm Model 1887s delivered in 1896 the Norwegian guns were still comparatively new. The Swedes on the other hand had replaced their rifled muzzle-loaders already in 1883 and were more ready for a replacement.
Trials and choice of gun.
In the end nine different artillery systems were considered by the Norwegians, and eight bought or loaned for testing. Two guns were found to be within requirements, one 7.5 cm gun from Schneider-Canet and one of the same calibre from "Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik" in Germany. After extensive testing under varied conditions, both summer and winter, during the years 1899-1901, and modifications of the artillery pieces to Norwegian specifications, the Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901 was chosen. The tests were carried out by the Field and Mountain Artillery School, and included a march across the Dovrefjell mountains to Stjørdal in Nord-Trøndelag. The Norwegian Ministry of Defence, now under the leadership of Georg Stang, chose the artillery system over protests from the opposition Conservative Party of Norway, which demanded that a new system from Krupp be tested before the new gun could be chosen. This criticism was brushed aside by the Ministry of Defence, stating that the military assessment had found the Model 1901 to be the best gun. Before the Ministry of Defence had reached its decision it tested a battery of Model 1901s against a battery of 7.5 cm Schneider-Canet guns. After further testing the Model 1901 was still considered the best choice, although it was decided that further changes to the design were needed.
Procurement of the Model 1901.
In all 138 Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901s were manufactured, the type being delivered only to Norway. The Norwegian experience with the new system for quick-firing led to the major arms factories in Europe all adopting the same type of recoil system for their own artillery systems. Norwegian companies also modified the Armed Forces' older guns with the new recoil system so they could remain in service longer. Components that could be manufactured in Norway was produced under licence at Norwegian factories, with Norwegian labour organizations pushing for the creation of new jobs for the work force. The Ehrhardt Model 1901 was designated "7,5cm feltkanon M/1901" in Norwegian military service. The purchase of modern artillery for the Norwegian Army was motivated by the military build-up leading to the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905.
General characteristics.
The new artillery pieces consisted of a core tube and mantlet with a mechanism retainer, 28 rifles, Nordenfelt eccentric screw and hydraulic brakes with a spring system for returning the tube to position. This made the Model 1901 Norway's first quick-firing gun. The gun's range was , firing a standard shell. The Model 1901 was long, with a barrel length of . The gun shields of the Model 1901 were detachable.
Further development in Norway.
In the first years after 1901 the Model 1901's full potential could not be exploited due to a lack of effective aiming systems. The artillery pieces were delivered with open sights and could only be used for direct fire. New aiming systems were only introduced in 1911, when the field guns were modified at Kongsberg Armaments Factory and fitted with Goerz panoramic telescopes. This, together with other technical advances and the introduction of forward artillery observers, allowed effective indirect fire to be carried out.
Ammunition.
Up until 1921 the ammunition used by the Norwegian artillery was the black-powder case shot and the high-explosive case shot. A high-explosive artillery shell with significantly longer range was introduced in 1921, but not put into regular use. A gas shell was also designed and approved in 1921, although never put into production.
Modifications.
During the 1920s complaints about the performance of the gun started coming in to the authorities. Wear and tear was beginning to have an effect on the guns, and soon people were suggesting that the type should be replaced with a new field gun model. The demands for a new artillery system was rejected, and instead the old guns were sent to a full maintenance overhaul. The maintenance solved the problems with the Model 1901, some guns also being fitted with rubber tires and rebuilt for motor transport during the 1930s. By 1940 at least 12 artillery pieces had been modified for motor transport. Until 9 April 1940 German invasion of Norway the gun remained the main field gun of the Norwegian Army.
Second World War.
Norwegian Campaign.
On 9 April 1940 Nazi Germany invaded Norway, capturing ports along the Norwegian coast from Oslo to Narvik. The main field artillery piece of the Norwegian Army that faced the invasion forces was the Ehrhardt Model 1901. During the two months of fighting in the Norwegian Campaign that followed the Norwegian field artillery arm suffered greatly from organizational difficulties. The difficulties originated in part from the fact that very few artillery pieces had been mobilized during the seven months of neutrality that preceded the invasion. The units that had been activated to guard Norwegian neutrality had been equipped mainly with rifles and light and heavy machine guns. In the confusion and chaos that followed the German invasion most Norwegian units were only mobilized on an improvised basis, with limited supplies and little time to get properly organized before going into battle with the Germans. Only in Northern and Western Norway did the units (the 6th Division in Northern Norway and the 4th Brigade in Western Norway) have time to mobilize in an orderly fashion. Due to the complete lack of dedicated anti-tank guns in the Norwegian Army, Model 1901s were pressed into service in an improvised anti-tank role during the fighting in Eastern Norway. The field guns were used in direct fire mode at close range against German Panzers. All 12 of the Model 1901 field guns that had been converted to motorized transport were deployed to Northern Norway at the outbreak of war, with four in Troms County and eight in the eastern parts of Finnmark. Seven of these guns saw action on the Narvik front, supporting the Norwegian offensive against Eduard Dietl's Gebirgsjägers.
In Finnish service.
As part of its covert support for Finland during the 1939-1940 Winter War, the Norwegian government donated a field artillery battalion to the Finnish Army in February 1940. The guns were taken from stocks of artillery that had become surplus to requirement after large-scale cuts to the Norwegian military during the interwar period. The artillery pieces were delivered in response to a request for arms supplies from the Finnish foreign minister Väinö Tanner on 8 December 1939. In addition to artillery the Finns had also requested various types of ammunition, fighter aircraft and hand grenades, weapons that Norway could not provide. The secret transfer of the Model 1901 guns to Finland was a clear violation of the rules of neutrality on behalf of the Norwegian government. The 12 guns were delivered with 7,166 shells via the Swedish Bofors armaments company. In Finland the guns were given the designation "75 K 01". Eleven of the guns saw service in the Winter War with Field Artillery Regiment 9, firing some 36,400 shells during the conflict. More ammunition for the guns were later procured by the Finnish Army from Norwegian ammunition stocks captured by the Germans in 1940. During the Continuation War the guns were first issued to the fortification artillery, from 1942 being transferred to the coastal artillery arm.
In German service.
When Nazi Germany conquered Norway in the two-month long Norwegian Campaign in 1940 they captured many examples of the Norwegian "7,5cm feltkanon M/1901" and re-designated them "7,5 cm FK 246(n)". The guns remained in German service in Norway until the end of the war, amongst other uses deployed in coastal artillery fortifications. During their 1940-1945 occupation of Norway the Germans rebuilt at least 17 Model 1901s as anti-tank guns.
Post-war use.
After the end of the Second World War the "7,5cm feltkanon M/1901" was quickly replaced with more modern types in the Norwegian Army. The last time the artillery system was used for sharpshooting exercises was with the concluding exercise of the Field Artillery's Officer School in August 1947 at Hjerkinn training area. Following the type's retirement from active duty the Model 1901 has continued into the 21st century as a saluting gun at many Norwegian fortresses. The gun had a central role in the 2005 commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905.

I Am Rich is an iOS application which was formerly distributed using the App Store, and developed by Armin Heinrich. When launched, the screen only contains a glowing red gem, and an icon that when pressed, displays the following mantra in large text:
I am rich
I deserv it
I am good,
healthy &
successful
The application is described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all", with its only purpose being to show other people that they were able to afford it, making it a Veblen good. "I Am Rich" was sold on the App Store for 999.99 United States dollars, 799.99 euros, and 599.99 pounds sterling, the highest price Apple allows for App Store content. The application was removed from the App Store by Apple Inc. without explanation the day following its release, on .
Purchases.
While the application was available, eight people bought it, at least one of whom claimed to have done so accidentally. Six US sales at $999.99 and two European ones for €799.99 netted between $5,600–5,880 for developer Armin Heinrich and $2,400–2,520 for Apple. In correspondence with the "Los Angeles Times", Heinrich told the newspaper that Apple had refunded two purchasers of his app, and that he was happy not to have dissatisfied customers.
Reception.
Discussing the app on Silicon Alley Insider website, Dan Frommer described the program as a "scam", "worthless", and finally "a joke that smells like a scammy rip-off" on August 5, 6, and 8, respectively. Without purchasing the app, FOXNews.com's Paul Wagenseil guessed that the secret mantra was "German for 'Sucker! (as Heinrich is German). "Wired" magazine's Brian X. Chen described "I Am Rich" as a waste of money to "prove you're a jerk", and contrasted the expenditure with donating to cancer foundations and Third-World countries.
Heinrich told the "Los Angeles Times" Mark Milian that he had received correspondence from satisfied customers, "I've got e-mails from customers telling me that they really love the app [... and that they had] no trouble spending the money."

22nd Mechanised Brigade (Ukraine)

The 22nd Mechanised Brigade was a formation of the Ukrainian Ground Forces from 2000-2003. However most of its historical traditions stem from the 66th Guards Rifle Division, originally a formation of the Red Army and later of the Soviet Ground Forces.
After 26 October 1999, full name of the Division became 66th Guards Mechanized Bukovyna, Poltava Red Banner Division of the 38th Army Corps of the Western Operational Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ()
History.

Park Avenue Historic District (Detroit, Michigan)

The Park Avenue Historic District is a historic district located in Detroit, Michigan, along Park Avenue between Adams St. and I-75. The district includes the Women's City Club, the Detroit Building, the Park Avenue House, and the Kales Building. The district was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1996 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.
History.
In the 1920s, Detroit's prestigious Grand Circus Park was crowded with buildings. The automotive boom in the city increased the pressure for office space, and development began to spill north from Grand Circus Park up Park Avenue. In 1922, Albert Kahn designed the Park Avenue Building, sited at the corner of Adams and Park Avenue. The Kales Building, a previous Kahn design, stood on the other side of Park Avenue, giving the street two prestigious buildings at its southern gateway. Other architects and artisans contributed hotels, apartment buildings, and office buildings to the structures on Park Avenue.
In 1923, the Park Avenue Association was formed. They planned the street to concentrate high-grade commercial and office space at the south end, and prestigious residential development at the north end. As the district developed, Detroiters consciously perceived it as their city's version of New York City's Fifth Avenue.
Also on Park Avenue was Women's City Club and the Detroit chapter of the Colony Club, both critical in providing women with social and work activities and supporting women's suffrage.
The area was used decreasingly during the Great Depression, but saw a resurgence after World War II, with a mix of social groups and multiple restaurant and entertainment venues. At the same time, an industrial character was added to the district when the Iodent Chemical Company began manufacturing toothpaste in a building along Park Avenue. The proximity of the Fox Theatre and other nearby venues (including Comerica Park) has led to increased redevelopment in the 2000s. The Kales Building and the Iodent Building have been redeveloped into lofts, the Colony Club has been refurbished, and two new entertainment venues, Cliff Bell's and the Park Bar, have opened.
The district was listed on the state register of historic places in 1996, and on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

Pyrotecnico

Pyrotecnico is a professional fireworks company based in New Castle, Pennsylvania. The company was founded in 1889 by Constantino Vitale. They currently operate nationwide with over 1,000 technicians throughout the U.S. with six primary offices located in New Castle, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Montgomery, New Orleans, and Tampa. Pyrotecnico has worked with over 10,000 different organizations in the past 10 years including the fireworks and special effects for MTV's halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVIII in Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas and the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Pyrotecnico was recently awarded with the 2008 Gold Jupiter Award representing the United States at the L'International des Feux Loto-Québec.
Early days.
In 1889 Constantino Vitale started this fireworks company in Pietramelara, Italy. In 1920 he immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island making a home for his family and company in New Castle, Pennsylvania — a small town between Pittsburgh and Cleveland that would become known as "The Fireworks Capital of America."
Twentieth century.
Constantino brought with him centuries of fireworks expertise which he taught to his apprentices his children and grandchildren. The Vitale family developed a reputation for grand and dramatic fireworks displays and the business grew rapidly in the United States.
At the turn of the century, the company was one of the largest fireworks companies in the country. By 1940 the company was headed by Constantino's son, Rocco Vitale Sr., who led the expansion of the facilities in New Castle which were also briefly used to manufacture explosives for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Many of these buildings still stand today, across the street from the corporate headquarters.
Five different generations of the Vitale family have grown Constantino's company. In the 1990s the company took on the name "Pyrotecnico" to reflect the variety of products that it used to complement explosives, like confetti, streamer cannons, lighting, fog, smoke, air dancers, close proximity effects and synchronized pyrotechnics to pre-recorded audio or live performance.
Today.
Pyrotecnico is still headquartered in New Castle, PA and in 2007, completed a facility for its headquarters. The company has offices in New Castle, PA; Atlanta, GA; Auburn, NY; Dallas, TX; New Orleans, LA; Las Vegas, NV; Montgomery, AL; Philadelphia, PA / Vineland, NJ; Jaffrey, NH; Columbia, SC; Tampa, FL and Fort Lauderdale, FL.

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Loznitsa Municipality, which lies in the southernmost part of the Province. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 2,409 inhabitants.
In Antiquity, Thracians Romans and Byzantines inhabited the area; there are also traces of a Bulgarian settlement dating to the 7th-11th century, the time of the First Bulgarian Empire. The old Ottoman Turkish name of Loznitsa was "Kubadın" and it was first mentioned in a register in 1573. Around the time of the Liberation of Bulgaria, present Loznitsa was a village of 66 households according to Russian data. In the early 20th century, Bulgarians from the Balkan Mountains settled in the village. A school was built in 1908, and the local community centre ("chitalishte") "Probuda" was founded in 1912.
In 1934, the old Turkish name was changed to the Bulgarian "Loznitsa", honouring the region's viticultural traditions ("loza" means "vine" in Bulgarian). On 4 September 1974, the village was proclaimed a town. Loznitsa has a mixed population of Bulgarians, Turks, and Romani. The town is twinned with the Küçükçekmece suburb of Istanbul, Turkey.

Yungas Tyrannulet

The Yungas Tyrannulet ("Phyllomyias weedeni") is a species of bird in the Tyrannidae family, the tyrant flycatchers. It is, as suggested by its common name, restricted to humid and semi-humid forest in the Yungas of north-western Bolivia and far south-eastern Peru. Although discovered in the early 1990s, it was only formally described in 2008.
The Yungas Tyrannulet resembles the Planalto Tyrannulet, but has a different voice. Being recently described it has not yet been rated by BirdLife International; however, it has been suggested it should be considered vulnerable, because it occurs in low densities within a small range that is subjected to extensive habitat destruction.

Chippewa's motto is "Carpe Diem" which translates to Seize The Day. Athletes and students at Chippewa are known as the Chippewa Raiders, and the school colours are scarlet and gold.
Critics of Chippewa and those who discriminate against First Nations people attempted to tarnish the image of the school's beloved mascot, Joe Raider. Many spineless collaborators within the school also took part in the tarnishing, but, as evidenced by this page, Joe Raider remains the uncontested favourite of the students.
The school was founded in 1958 and was named after the First Nation Chippewas.

The Lake Cowichan First Nation government and reserve is located in Lake Cowichan, British Columbia. The Lake Cowichan First Nation, while its own distinct group, is closely linked to the peoples of the Cowichan Tribes band government, and is part of the Hul'qumi'num linguistic group
There are over 15 registered tribal members.
History.
Early settlers to the Lake Cowichan area described "a small tribe of Indians" living in "houses constructed of bark." During the 19th Century the Lake Cowichan First Nation was decimated by disease and conflict with neighboring groups. In 1887 the surveyor Ashdown Green reported that the Lake Cowichan people had once been a large tribe but had been nearly wiped out by war with the neighboring Cowichan Tribes and Ditidahts. In 1860, a prospetor by the name of Samuel Harris travelled to the area seeking minerals and reported that many of the Natives were dead and dying from smallpox. Archaeological investigations have revealed the historic presence of a village on the north east side of the lake, within the boundaries of the present day Cowichan Lake Indian Reserve.

2003 Arizona Cardinals season

The 2003 Arizona Cardinals season was the 84th season the team was in the National Football League.

Eustace Denis Piers Bisgood (6 February 1878 – 4 March 1958) was an English cricketer who made one first-class appearance for Somerset in 1909. 
Life and career.
Eustace Bisgood was born in Glastonbury, Somerset on 6 February 1878. Bisgood's younger brother, Bertram, played for Somerset 67 times between 1907 and 1921, during which time Somerset often struggled to find eleven players to field in their matches. Sammy Woods, who was the club captain until 1906, commented on the period after his captaincy, stating that in one year, "more than 30 people played, some, as you may imagine, very poor performers." It was during this time that Bisgood made his solitary appearance for Somerset, travelling with the team to Gravesend to play a County Championship match against Kent in 1909. Bisgood batted in both innings, and along with his brother, was one of three Somerset players to be dismissed for a duck in the first innings. In the second, he scored six runs, having taken a catch during Kent second innings. Somerset lost the match by 279 runs.
At his death in Sidmouth, Devon, on 4 March 1958, Bisgood was described as a "retired stock jobber".

Graha bhedam

Graha Bhedam in Carnatic music is the process (or result of the process) of shifting the Tonic note ("śruti") to another note in the rāgam and arriving at a different rāgam.
"Graha" literally means "position" and "Bhedam" means "change". Since the position of the "śruti" is changed (pitch of the drone), it is also sometimes called "Swara Bhedam" or Śruti Bhedam though "Śruti Bhedam" and "Graha Bhedam" have some technical differences.
Definition.
Modal shift of the Tonic note to higher notes of a rāgam, while retaining the note's positions (swara sthānas – sthāna means position/ pitch), results in different rāgams. This is called "Graha Bhedam". 
Practical demo.
A simple practical demonstration of "Graha Bhedam" can be taken up by playing the structure of a rāgam with the drone set to Sa ("Shadjamam"). Then if we keep playing the same keys/ notes, while shifting the drone to another note in the rāgam, to form the new śruti/ tonic note, the result is a different rāgam.
Example Illustration.
When "Graha bhedam" is applied on Shankarabharanam's notes, it yields 5 other major "Melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Kalyani", "Hanumatodi", "Natabhairavi", "Kharaharapriya" and "Harikambhoji".
Notes on above table
Melakarta Rāgams.
"Graha Bhedam" can be applied on most "Melakarta" rāgams to yield other "Melakarta" rāgams (16 of the 72 do not yield any valid "Melakarta" scale). When applying such modal shift of tonic note, some results are not valid Melakarta rāgams (rules of the definition of Melakarta are violated). Example scenarios are missing "Panchamam" (Pa) or two of particular note ("Rishabham" (Ri), "Gandharam" (Ga), "Madhyamam" (Ma), "Dhaivatam" (Da) or "Nishadam" (Ni)).

"Janya rāgams".
"Graha bhedam" can be applied to some of the "janya" rāgams to yield other "janya" rāgams. Unlike "Melakarta" rāgams, where strict rules are adhered to, in terms of which "swaras" can be chosen in a rāgam, "janya" rāgams do not have such rules. Hence, such modal shift of tonic note is valid on all "swaras", but may not have been chosen as a rāgam, experimented, elaborated and composed. Hence they lead to theoretical rāgams, which have not yet been discovered (all combinations of notes exist, but no one has composed using a particular combination or experimented/ exposed to the world at large).

Younger's

Younger’s was an Edinburgh brewery which grew from humble beginnings in 1778 to become one of the city’s main commercial enterprises, supplying domestic and foreign markets. It should not be confused with another, less renowned Edinburgh brewery, that of Robert Younger, who also brewed in Holyrood at the St. Ann's Brewery. 
In 1931 Younger's merged with McEwan’s to form Scottish Brewers, which in turn merged with Newcastle Breweries in 1960 to form Scottish & Newcastle. By the late 1960s the combine employed the largest single workforce in the city.
The company’s UK operations were taken over by Heineken in 2008. In October 2011 the Bedford-based Wells & Young's Brewery announced that it had purchased the Younger's and McEwan's brands from Heineken UK.
Younger family.
The Younger family home was in the village of Linton (now West Linton), Peeblesshire, where their house still stands. Younger’s father was a farmer, vintner and bailie. The surname may be of Dutch or Flemish origin (possibly from Yonckeers). A William Younger of Flemish extraction is recorded in a Berwickshire legal document of 1515, and a John Younger of Cockburnspath, Berwickshire was accused of cattle-stealing in 1559.
The first Younger recorded at Linton is Thomas Younger, whose will, dated 17 February 1597, is held by Register House in Edinburgh. One family member was a Commissioner of Militia for Peeblesshire in the reign of Charles II. Others were elders of the Kirk in the reign of William II and one, around 1700, was a Writer to the Signet.
In 1749, William Younger left home for Edinburgh, aged 16, and whilst it is often speculated that he found employment in Robert Anderson's brewhouse in Leith, there is no documentary evidence for this. In 1753 he met his future wife Grizel Cochrane Syme, who was also from Linton. Thanks to her family connections (Thomas Cochrane, later 8th earl of Dundonald, was a Commissioner of Excise), it appears that before their marriage William became an exciseman. As second watchman at the new Leith Glass Works, he oversaw the collection of Government duty on manufactured bottles. When his father died in 1755, he inherited a share of the family’s wealth, and this, together with his exciseman’s salary of £25 per annum, enabled him to marry. A year later, he was promoted at the age of twenty-five to be one of the "Excise Surveyors of Edinburgh and precincts" on a salary of £60 per annum.
As his personal wealth increased in the 1760s, Younger bought land, a house, a share in a ship, a co-partnership in a stage coach company and a share in brewery premises near the Kirkgate, Leith. In 1768 he increased the storage facilities for the brewery by purchasing seven large cellars, two dwelling houses and a large warehouse in Broad Wynd. Shortly thereafter he joined three friends in taking over the Edinburgh-Leith stage coach company. He also bought a part share in a brig on the London-Leith run, named "William of Leith" which also carried cargo as far afield as Hamburg and Danzig. Overworked and ill by the end of 1769, Younger died on 5 May of that year. His widow Grizel married Leith brewer Alexander Anderson and continued to brew under the name Grizel Younger Anderson until 1794.
Family firm.
In 1778 one of Younger’s sons, Archibald Campbell Younger, having served his apprenticeship under Anderson, established his own brewery within the precincts of the Abbey of Holyroodhouse. This began an association of the area with brewing which lasted until demolition of the Abbey Brewery in the 1990s. The move made good business sense, because at that time several hundred people lived within the Abbey sanctuary and ale brewed there escaped the two pennies Scots custom levied by Edinburgh Town Council after 1693 on every pint brewed within the town walls. Younger’s strong ale was sold in the taverns of the High Street, the Cowgate and the Grassmarket in Edinburgh’s Old Town. Robert Chambers, in his "Traditions of Edinburgh", writes of Johnnie Dowie’s Tavern in Libberton’s Wynd (swept away by the creation of George IV Bridge), "Johnnie Dowie’s was chiefly celebrated for ale – Younger’s Edinburgh ale – a potent fluid which almost glued the lips of the drinker together, and of which few, therefore, could despatch more than a bottle".
In 1786 Younger acquired a second, larger brewery at Croft-an-Righ, an ancient lane bordering the eastern precinct wall of the Abbey. In 1793 he opened new and even larger premises in the North Back Canongate (now Calton Road) on a site that disappeared later with the building of Waverley Station. The new brewery had two malt floors, each a hundred feet long, a spring water well, and ten tuns each capable of brewing thirty barrels.
19th-century growth.
Meanwhile, another of William Younger’s sons, William II, had started his own brewhouse within the Abbey precincts and had begun penetrating the London market. In the "Morning Post Gazetter" of 19 May 1802 his London agent reported the arrival of "Mr. William Younger’s much admired ALE, in casks and bottles, which, being carefully selected by himself from the stock of that famous brewer, will be found on trial to surpass in strength and flavour any ever offered to sale in London".
In 1803 William moved premises after buying an existing brewhouse, malt barn, kiln house, stables and dwelling house in the narrow lane between the Canongate and the Abbey known as Horse Wynd. In "The Beauties of Scotland", Robert Forsyth stated that "The ale which has acquired the highest reputation, and is now bought up with great avidity in London and other distant markets, is that prepared by two brothers who carry on business separately, Messrs Younger". In 1806, however, Archibald and William collaborated in producing a London-style porter for the Scottish market which was sold under the name of A.C. and W. Younger.
After Archibald died, aged 62, in 1819, William, now 52, arranged the sale of his brother’s brewery and in 1825 expanded his own by purchasing property on the opposite side of Horse Wynd for £5,000. This, together with neighbouring ground acquired in 1829, was the site which developed into the Abbey Brewery, with which the name Younger’s would become chiefly associated. By the 1830s Younger’s ales were being sold all over Scotland, the north east of England and London. By the time of his death in 1842 William had joined forces with fellow brewer, Alexander Smith, and was exporting Scotch ales to New York and St. Louis in the United States, as well as Britain’s overseas colonies.
After William II’s death, his son William III and Smith’s son, Andrew, expanded the business as partners in the 1840s, concentrating particularly on the North American market while also sending hogsheads on clippers bound for Bombay and Adlelaide. William II’s grandson, William IV, joined the business at this stage as it continued to prosper. He took over running the firm with Smith after William III died in 1854. During the Crimean War the company won a lucrative government contract to supply beer to the army. By 1856 San Francisco was receiving regular shipments, and in the following year Philadelphia, Montreal, Baltimore and New Orleans joined the rapidly growing list of new markets, as did the Caribbean islands, Buenos Aires and even Honolulu.
In 1858 the Abbey Brewery began to expand following the acquisition of adjacent brewery premises and, a little later, Brodie’s Land further up the Canongate. This was the area between the Canongate and the South Back Canongate (now Holyrood Road) which was developed as the Holyrood Brewery. New storage was also built at Park Stores, Abbeyhill next to the old Croft-an-Righ site. At about the same time, the premises on the Palace side of Horse Wynd were abandoned to become royal property on the initiative of Prince Albert. The company opened its London branch office at St. Paul’s Wharf, Upper Thames Street in 1861. By the 1930s the firm had acquired a number of traditional pubs in the London area, styled "Scotch Houses", including "Ye Olde London" on Ludgate Hill, which began life as the "London Coffee House" in 1731. The London branch moved eventually to Princes Wharf, Commercial Road, Lambeth, in 1932 and was sold off in the 1970s to make way for part of the South Bank Development.
In 1869 both Younger and Smith retired from the business, passing control to three partners: William III’s younger sons, Henry and David, and Smith’s son Alexander. William IV died in 1886.
20th-century developments.
By the beginning of the 20th century it was reckoned that Younger’s was producing a quarter of all Scotland's beer. The company’s overseas trade had grown so rapidly that 80,000 barrels a year were leaving the London stores alone for sixty overseas-based agencies. Cargoes were being carried from Leith to Belgium which became a principal market; private customers included the Czar of Russia and his household; and deliveries were finding their way across the world to destinations ranging alphabetically from Alexandria to Zanzibar.
Growth continued throughout the Great War, and in 1920 the firm installed its first bottling plant for new fashioned chilled and carbonated beers in the Holyrood Brewery. Scotch Ale, Nos.1, 2 and 3 (resembling English Burton ales) began to rival India Pale Ale in popularity. Alfred Leete’s ‘Father William’ trade mark appeared for the first time at the end of the 1920s.
Despite its healthy level of authorised capital and dividends, the onset of the Depression in 1930 induced the board to propose a merger of the company with its great Edinburgh rival McEwan’s to form a new combine to be known as Scottish Brewers Ltd. with effect from 6 December 1931. While both companies continued to produce their own ales marketed under their own names, they now shared financial and technical resources; and exports were handled by a new company, McEwan-Younger Ltd.
Scottish Brewers continued to increase its market share in the brewing sector, doubling its output after a costly five-year programme of expansion and modernisation undertaken between 1958 and 1963. The company eventually merged with Newcastle's Tyne Brewery in 1960 to form Scottish & Newcastle Ltd., a giant of the British brewing industry until its takeover by Carlsberg, part of the Heineken group, in 2008. The Abbey Brewery had closed in 1956 to be redeveloped as the Head Office of Scottish & Newcastle. The Holyrood Brewery closed in 1986. Both sites are now occupied by the buildings of the devolved Scottish Parliament.

The State Counseller () is a 2005 Russian film, an adaptation of Boris Akunin's novel of the same name featuring detective Erast Fandorin. Directed by Filipp Yankovsky, it was one of the most expensive films ever made in Russia.
A revolutionary organisation is planning to assassinate the Governor of Moscow as the first step to overthrowing the Tsarist state. Detective Erast Fandorin attempts to counter them, but his efforts are hindered by his dealings with Prince Pozharsky.
The film's promotional title in Russian uses the old-fashioned, pre-Revolutionary spelling Статскiй совѣтникъ which contrasts with the modern spelling Статский советник.

Tzova

Tzova (), also Palmach Tzova () or Tsuba, is a kibbutz in the Judean Hills, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israel. It is under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Yehuda Regional Council. In 2007, the kibbutz had a population of 578.
History.
Tel Tzova was the site of an ancient Jewish settlement in the days of King David according to 2 Samuel 23:36. According to some scholars it can be dated back even further to the time of Joshua Bin-Nun, based on Joshua 15:59 in the Septuagint. 
In 1170, a Crusader fortress, Belmont, was built there to guard the route to Jerusalem. Belmont was conquered by Saladin in 1191. 
The adjacent Arab village of Suba was the scene of fierce fighting during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War due to its strategic location overlooking the road to Jerusalem. In late 1947 and early 1948, irregular forces of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood stationed in Suba attacked on Jewish traffic on the main highway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The village was conquered by the Palmach during the night of July 12–13 as part of Operation Danny. Most of the inhabitants had fled during the fighting, and those who remained were expelled. In October 1948, the "Ameilim" group of Palmach veterans established Kibbutz Misgav Palmach 1 km south of Suba, which was later renamed Tzova.
Economy.
The kibbutz runs a hotel overlooking the Jerusalem Hills and a children's amusement park called "Kiftzuba" featuring inflatables, bumper cars, a petting zoo, a games arcade, an indoor computer center and other attractions. The kibbutz also runs a boutique winery, with a variety of red and white wines, some of which have won gold and silver medals in international competitions. Another source of income is the kibbutz Hebrew language ulpan. Other economic branches are fruit and dairy farming and a factory that produces bulletproof windshields.
Archaeology.
In 1999, a cave believed to have been the cave of St. John the Baptist was discovered by Reuven Kalifon during archaeological excavations in the area of the kibbutz orchards, not far from Ein Karem, St. John's traditional birthplace. In the 4th and 5th century CE, the cave was sanctified and used by Byzantine monks as a Christian holy place. On its walls are some of the earliest drawings known in local Christian art. Structures outside the cave date to the Hellenistic period (2nd century CE) and indicate that the cave was used as both a water reservoir and a place for bathing. Water was collected from the valley and channeled into the cave via a water-filtering basin. A sluice allowed some of the water to be channeled from the filtering basin into the fields.
Archaeologists discovered a flight of 28 steps leading to an underground pool of water and 250,000 pottery shards, possibly the remnants of small water jugs used in the baptismal ritual.

Spring Bank

Spring Bank Plc., also referred to as Spring Bank, is a commercial bank in Nigeria. It is one of the twenty-six (26) commercial banks licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, the country's banking regulator.
Overview.
Spring Bank is a large financial services provider in Nigeria. , the bank's total assets were estimated at about US$1.31 billion (NGN:201.3 billion). The stock of Spring Bank is listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, where it trades under the symbol: SPRINGBANK.
History.
Spring Bank was formed in December 2005 by the merger of six (6) Nigerian financial institutions, namely:
At the time it was formed, Spring Bank had a capital base of approximately US$224 million (NGN:34.5 billion) with total assets estimated at approximately US$988 million (NGN:152 billion).
Failure and liquidation.
In 2009, following an industry-wide audit of all commercial banks in the country, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the banking regulator in the country, found nine commercial banks under-capitalized and badly managed. Spring Bank was one of the troubled banks. The CBN intervened by injecting new capital to maintain solvency and appointing new management. On 5 August 2011 the CBN revoked the banking license of Spring Bank.
Enterprise Bank was formed in August 2011 by taking over the assets and some of the liabilities of the now defunct Spring Bank, whose commercial banking license was revoked. EBL was issued a commercial banking license on 5 August 2011. As of January 2012, the assets of Enterprise Bank Limited are 100% owned by Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON), an arm of the Federal Government of Nigeria. In July 2012, the Federal High Court of Nigeria, in Lagos ordered that the affairs of the defunct Spring Bank Plc be wound up, since its license had been revoked.
Governance.
Following the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 2009, Bernadina Sola Ayodele was appointed Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.

Blue Man (horse)

Blue Man (foaled 1949) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the Preakness Stakes.
Background.
Blue Man was bred by Allen T. Simmons at his Lexington, Kentucky horse farm, a property that had been part of the renowned Idle Hour Stock Farm. Blue Man's dam was Poppycock, a granddaughter of Man o' War. His sire was Blue Swords, who won several handicaps and ran second to Count Fleet in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Grandsire Blue Larkspur was the 1929 American Horse of the Year and a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee.
Blue Man was owned by Arthur Abbott of Rye, New York, founder of Abbott's Frozen Custard, who raced him under the White Oak Stable banner. He was rained by future Hall of Fame inductee Woody Stephens.
Racing career.
Early races.
at age two Blue Man showed limited racing ability. In the spring of 1952, the then three-year-old colt won the important Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah Park in Florida. In the ensuing Kentucky Derby, he finished third to winner Hill Gail, then won the most important race of his career in the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series.
1952 Preakness Stakes.
Derby winner Hill Gail had to be withdrawn from the Preakness as a result of an injury, but Blue Man still faced a solid field led by Walter M. Jeffords' highly regarded One Count, who was to be ridden by star jockey, Eddie Arcaro. Blue Man was ridden by Conn McCreary, a top jockey and future Hall of Fam inductee who had won the 1944 Preakness and was known for his dramatic come-from behind rides. In typical McCreary style, by the time he and Blue Man reached the three-quarter pole they were at the back of the pack, running ahead of just one other horse. One by one, they began passing the field, then pulled away in the homestretch to win by three-and-a-half lengths. For trainer Woody Stephens, Blue Man was his first of nine Preakness starters and his only winner.
Later races.
Sent to compete in the final leg of the Triple Crown, the 1½ mile Belmont Stakes, Blue Man ran second to One Count. That year, Blue Man won other important races such as the Yankee Handicap at East Boston's Suffolk Downs and the Dwyer Stakes held that year at the Old Aqueduct Racetrack.
Stud record.
Retired to stud duty, in 1958 Blue Man was sold to Canadian breeder Frank R. Conklin who stood him at his Midway Farm in Brantford, Ontario. Successful as a sire and damsire, Blue Man produced a number of Canadian stakes race winners.

Pineapple production in Ivory Coast

Ivory Coast dominates the fresh pineapple trade. The export of pineapple products began during Ivory Coast's colonial period, when two processing plants were established with foreign help.
History.
When Ivory Coast gained independence, the export of pineapple products was less than half that of banana products. During the 1960s and 1970s, exports grew steadily, and by the early 1970s, the number of pineapple exports had surpassed the number of banana exports. In the 1980s, Thailand began competing with Ivory Coast, pushing world prices downward. Economic reforms in Ivory Coast reduced subsidies for several state enterprises and closed others, including Corfruitel, the parastatal in charge of marketing fruits, such as pineapples. At this time, most pineapple exports were canned pineapples or pineapple juice. For the reasons highlighted above, exports of these two products had practically disappeared by 1990.
At this time, much of the Ivorian pineapple industry switched over to fresh pineapple. In a very advantageous move, it exported these to Europe by sea-freight, using the same refrigerated freighters used for bananas. Ivory Coast once quasi-monopolised the world market on fresh pineapples, although it no longer enjoys that status once Costa Rica, Honduras, Ghana and other suppliers began developing their share of the industry.
Farming and production.
Ivory Coast is Europe's leading pineapple source, supplying over 200,000 tons of fresh fruit a year, or 60% of the European market. On the world scale, Ivory Coast is second only to Costa Rica. Combined, the two produce over 50% on the world's pineapples.
Products.
Cristelor.
The "Société fruitière du Bandama" company created the popular drink Cristelor in 1983. Described as a "delice d'ananas petillant," ("sparkling pineapple delight"), it is popularly called "pineapple champagne". The company's director, Jean Konan Banny, claimed the idea "came to when he thought to make a wine from pineapples" and was named after his granddaughter, Cristel. He also proposed an alcoholic version of the drink.
Research.
In 1987, scientists at the Institute of Research on Energy Renewal (IREN) studied how to create ethanol from pineapples in Ivory Coast.

Tuckahoe Creek is a tributary of the Choptank River on Maryland's Eastern Shore. It is sometimes (erroneously) referred to as the Tuckahoe River. Upstream of Hillsboro, it forms the boundary between Caroline County and Queen Anne's County, passing through Tuckahoe State Park and dividing the small towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro. Downstream of Hillsboro, it forms the boundary between Caroline County and Talbot County, before flowing into the Choptank.
Two miles south of Queen Anne, east of where Tapper's Corner Road ends at Lewistown Road, a creek flows () into the Tuckahoe at the birthplace of Frederick Douglass.

Khafajah

Khafajah or Khafaje (ancient Tutub) is an archaeological site in Diyala Province (Iraq). It was part of the city-state of Eshnunna. The site lies east of Baghdad and southwest of Eshnunna.
History of archaeological research.
Khafajah was excavated for 7 seasons in the early 1930s primarily by an Oriental Institute of Chicago team led by Henri Frankfort with Thorkild Jacobsen and Pinhas Delougaz. For two seasons, the site was worked by a joint team of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the University of Pennsylvania.
Khafajah and its environment.
Khafajah lies on the Diyala River, a tributary of the Tigris. The site consists of four mounds, labeled A through D. The main one, Mound A, extends back as far as the Uruk period and contained an oval temple, a temple of the god Sin, not surely and a temple of Nintu. The Dur-Samsuiluna fort was found on mounds B and C. Mound D contained private homes and a temple for the god Sin where the archive tablets where found in two heaps.
Occupation history.
Khafajah was occupied during the Early Dynastic Period, through the Sargonid Period, then came under the control of Eshnunna after the fall of the Ur III Empire. Later, after Eshnunna was captured by Babylon, a fort was built at the site by Samsu-iluna of the First Babylonian Dynasty and named Dur-Samsuiluna.
Material culture.
The history of Khafajah is known in somewhat more detail for a period of several decades as a result of the discovery of 112 clay tablets (one now lost) in a temple of Sin. The tablets constitute part of an official archive and include mostly loan and legal documents. The Oriental Institute of Chicago holds 57 of the tablets with the remainder being in the Iraq Museum.

Forbes Travel Guide

Forbes Travel Guide (formerly known as Mobil Guide or Mobil Travel Guide) is a star rating service and series of travel guides for hotels, restaurants and spas. In 2011, Forbes Travel Guide published its last set of guidebooks and on November 15, 2011, launched its new online home,ForbesTravelGuide.com which covers more than 250 international destinations, including Hong Kong, Macau, Beijing, Singapore, Shanghai and London. ForbesTravelGuide.com combines Forbes Travel Guide’s Five-Star travel ratings system with insights and perspectives from Forbes Travel Guide’s own inspectors. This website marks the first time in the company's history that the information is available to the public online, alongside expert answers from tastemakers, consumers, and some of the world’s leading hotel, restaurant and spa brands.
History.
Founded by Mobil in 1958, Forbes Travel Guide is the oldest travel guide in the United States. Ratings are given by anonymous, paid staff members in stars (with no half-stars or zero stars), based on objective criteria. A Four- or Five-star rating is a considerable honor, with only 60-70 hotels and restaurants receiving the top rating. The ratings serve as a Certification mark, in that Mobil had registered trademarks for the phrases and designs indicating each star rating level, and allowed only rated establishments to display them.
Although less exclusive than the Michelin Guide, Mobil employed a similar system of recommending and rating only approved establishments. For example, it only listed 9,000 of the 50,000 hotels in the United States.
Initially guides were regional and limited to the United States and Canada. The first, issued in 1958, covered five states in the Southwest and South Central United States. In 1960, this guide was revised and volumes covering the Northeastern States, the Great Lakes, and California and the West were introduced. Guides covering the Middle Atlantic States and the Northwestern states were introduced in 1962. In 1965, a guide for the Southeastern States was introduced, although only one state covered by this volume, Tennessee, had any Mobil service stations.
Later, the number of volumes was expanded, as regions covered by the guide shrank. For instance, California was covered by two volumes, one for the north and one for the south. City guides also followed. In 2008, Forbes Travel Guide launched the international star ratings program for hotels and spas with the release of the inaugural Forbes Travel Guide Beijing and Forbes Travel Guide Hong Kong and Macau. Published in print by ExxonMobil Travel Publications, until 2011, the guide was published online by HowStuffWorks.com. 
In October 2009, ExxonMobil licensed the brand to the Five Star Ratings Corporation, which is owned by internet entrepreneur and WebMD founder Jeff Arnold. Five Star Travel Corporation entered into a licensing agreement with Forbes Media, and renamed the Star Awards and guidebook series, Forbes Travel Guide. Forbes Travel Guide's new online home, ForbesTravelGuide.com, was launched in 2011, which marked the last year of publication of the traditional printed guidebook series.
Star Ratings.
The Mobil Travel Guide Star Ratings provided ratings and reviews of hotels, restaurants and spas on a scale of one star (average to good) to five stars (one of the best in the country) starting in 1958. Forbes Travel Guide has continued the Five-Star ratings with current ratings categories of Five-Star, Four-Star and Recommended, and has a team of inspectors who anonymously evaluate properties against proprietary standards.

<doc id="18759524" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18759524" title="Charlot equation">
Charlot equation

The Charlot equation, named after Gaston Charlot, is used in analytical chemistry to relate the hydrogen ion concentration, and therefore the pH, with the formal analytical concentration of an acid and its conjugate base. It can be used for computing the pH of buffer solutions when the approximations of the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation break down. The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation assumes that the autoionization of water is negligible and that the dissociation or hydrolysis of the acid and the base in solution are negligible (in other words, that the formal concentration is the same as the equilibrium concentration).
For an acid-base equilibrium such as AH A− + H+, the Charlot equation may be written as
where is the equilibrium concentration of H+, "K"a is the acid dissociation constant, "C"a and "C"b are the analytical concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base, respectively, and Δ = [H+ − The equation can be solved for [H+ by using the autoionization constant for water, "K"w, to introduce = "K"w/[H+. This results in the following cubic equation for [H+], which can be solved either numerically or analytically:
Derivation.
Starting from the definition of the equilibrium constant
one can solve for [H+] as follows:
The main issue is how to determine the equilibrium concentrations and [A− from the initial, or analytical concentrations "C"a and "C"b. This can be achieved by considering the electroneutrality and mass balance constraints on the system. The first constraint is that the total concentration of cations needs to equal the total concentration of anions, because the system has to be electrically neutral: 
Here M+ is the counterion that comes with the conjugate base, that is added to the solution. For example, if HA is acetic acid, A− would be acetate, which could be added to the solution in the form of sodium acetate. In this case, M+ would be the sodium cation. The equilibrium concentration [M+ is constant and equal to the analytical concentration of the base, "C"b. Therefore,
Because of mass balance, the sum of the equilibrium concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base has to remain equal to the sum of their analytical concentrations. (HA may convert into A− and vice versa, but what is lost of HA is gained of A−, keeping the sum constant.)
Substituting and solving for [HA:
Introducing the equations for and [A− into the equation for [H+] yields the Charlot equation.

Tei Junsoku

(1663–1734) was a Confucian scholar and government official of the Ryūkyū Kingdom. He has been described as being "in an unofficial sense... the 'minister of education'", and is particularly famous for his contributions to scholarship and education in Okinawa and Japan. Holding "ueekata" rank in the Ryukyuan government, he served at times in his career as magistrate of both Nago and Kumemura, and as a member of the "Sanshikan", the elite council of three chief advisors to the king. He is sometimes known as the "Sage of Nago" (名護聖人).
It was standard at the time for members of Ryūkyū's aristocratic class to have two names. "Tei Junsoku" was his Chinese-style name, while , incorporating his domain and rank, was his Yamato or Japanese-style name.
Life and career.
Tei Junsoku was born in Kumemura, the Okinawan center of classical Chinese learning, in 1663. He first journeyed to China in 1683 and stayed there for four years, studying the Confucian classics, among other subjects, just as many others raised and educated in the scholar-bureaucrat system in Kumemura did over the course of the kingdom's history. He would return to China several times during his career, serving as interpreter and in other roles as a member of official missions from the kingdom.
In 1714, he accompanied royal princes Yonagusuku and Kin in the , the seat of Japan's Tokugawa shogunate. While there, he met with a number of the top Confucian scholars in Tokugawa Japan, including Arai Hakuseki, chief advisor to the shogun, who is known to have had a particular interest in the exotic Ryūkyū Kingdom, Ogyū Sorai, and Sōrai's student Dazai Shundai. As a result of this meeting, Hakuseki would go on to write a in 1719; Shundai would likewise include comments about the Ryūkyū Kingdom and its relationship to Satsuma han in his works.
As magistrate of Kumemura, Junsoku oversaw in 1718 the establishment of the Meirindō, a school for study of the Chinese classics, on the grounds of the village's Confucian temple. The Meirindō quickly grew into the chief center for Chinese learning in the kingdom, and would later become the first public school in Okinawa prefecture. A stele dedicated to Junsoku stands in the rebuilt and relocated Confucian temple today.
Some time shortly thereafter, Junsoku presented to the shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune, via Satsuma, a copy of , a volume of Confucian maxims he compiled himself. A version annotated by Ogyū Sōrai and translated from the Chinese by shogunal advisor Muro Kyūsō would be reproduced and distributed and used as an element of textbooks in "terakoya" (temple schools) and later in public schools in Japan into the early 20th century.

John Cheyne (speaker)

Sir John Cheyne or Cheney (died 1414) was a Member of Parliament and briefly the initial Speaker of the House of Commons of England in the Parliament of October 1399, summoned by the newly acclaimed Henry IV.
In 1372 he married Margaret, daughter of William, Lord Deincourt and the widow of Robert, Lord Tiptoft which brought him wealth and status. He becamee an esquire in the king's household and was knighted in 1378.
He took part in a number of diplomatic missions and became MP for Gloucestershire in 1390, 1393, 1394 and 1399. On the last occasion he was elected Speaker, but stood down on the ostensible grounds of ill-health, but may have been persuaded to do so by the influence of Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, who was appalled by his election and warned the clergy that Cheyne was an inveterate 'enemy' of the contemporary church. The revolution of 1399 made for strange bedfellows. Although Cheyne is never called a 'Lollard' (heretic) by contemporaries, he was a core member of a connection of knights held (with good cause) to be promoters of, or at least sympathetic to, that emerging sect. His testament (in modern parlance, his will) did reflect some of that sect's attitudes but embedded in a good deal of orthodoxy. In that generation after John Wyclif, many sympathisers with the moral and social ideas of that scholar indeed hoped this would not prove incompatible with continuing devotion to orthodox piety and acceptance within the Catholic Church.
Under Henry IV he continued to be employed on diplomatic missions, including a two year trip to Rome in 1407.
He acquired property in Beckford, Gloucestershire as his principal estate. Being near to death, he was not implicated in the Oldcastle Rising of 1413/14, which involved a few, but far from all, of the sect, but the Cheynes of Drayton Beauchamp, Buckinghamshire, were, and they seem to have been his eventual heirs after the deaths of his sons.
He died in 1414 and was buried in Beckford churchyard. He had been married a second time to Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir Edward Lovetot of Southoe, Huntingdonshire with whom he had a son, John.

Schifferstadt (Frederick, Maryland)

Schifferstadt, also known as Scheifferstadt, is the oldest standing house in Frederick, Maryland.
History.
The stone abode was completed in 1758 as were the cast iron five plate stoves used to heat the rooms attest. The land the house stands on land purchased by German immigrant farmer Josef Brunner (later alternately spelled 'Bruner' and 'Brooner') in 1746. Brunner purchased of tract land known as "Tasker's Chance" from Frederick Town (current-day Frederick) homesteader Daniel Dulany. Brunner named the property after Klein Schifferstadt, his home town in the Rhineland-Palatinate region of southwestern Germany near Mannheim.
Architecture.
The sandstone for Schifferstadt's two-foot-thick walls came from a local quarry near Walkersville Maryland. In Josef Brunner's time, a stone house reflected the family’s social and financial success and stability. The work was finished by Josef's son Elias as Josef was killed in a horse accident (possibly) before the work was completed. The hand-hewn wood beams were pinned together with wooden pegs. Above the windows and doors on the first floor of the building are reinforced arches made of stone, supporting the outside walls above them. The roof is considered to be unusual with kick-up and flared eaves, and features a large "wishbone" chimney. There were four "Five Plate" cast iron wood fireplace inserts that keep most of the house warm. One is still there and is the basis for dating the house at 1758 because of the casting on the plate. Much of the original construction and detailing survives, showing particular examples of German influence. Schifferstadt is known to be the finest existing example of German colonial architecture in the United States.
Ownership, disrepair and restoration.
The house was owned by Brunner's family and descendants until the mid-19th century when it was sold (along with 94 acres) to Frederick resident Christian Steiner for $7,130. In 1899 the Steiner estate sold Schifferstadt to Edward C. Krantz for $16,000, who in turn sold the property to Frederick B. Krantz in 1926. In 1963, the Frederick B. Krantz estate was willed by his widow to daughters Evelyn A. Krantz, Olive Dinterman and Elizabeth Kirschman. By 1972 much of the original acreage had been sold and the house had fallen into a state of disrepair and endangered by development, but in July 1974 was sold by the Krantz sisters to Frederick County Landmarks Foundation. The foundation subsequently restored 
Schifferstadt and today operates it as an architectural and local history museum.

Baby 700 Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery

Baby 700 Cemetery is a World War I Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey. It contains the bodies of some of the soldiers killed during the battles at Gallipoli. During an eight-month campaign in 1915, Commonwealth and French forces sought to force Turkey out of the war, which would relieve the deadlock on the Western Front and open a supply route to Russia through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea.
Nomenclature.
The name "Baby 700" originated in cartographic notes on Allied maps. One of the hills in the Sari Bair range was shown as being 700 feet above sea level, and its summit was marked with a small circle. Maps showed another 700 foot hill immediately north of it, marked with a larger circle. These notations led to the names Baby 700 and Big 700 being assigned to them by the Commonwealth forces. Baby 700 retained its name throughout the campaign. Big 700 was later renamed Battleship Hill. 
Action.
The 3rd Australian Brigade landed at Anzac Cove on April 25, 1915 and successfully reached the summit on the morning of the landing. It was driven off the summit in a Turkish counterattack in the afternoon. Allied forces made several attempts to recapture it over the following months, with major assaults on May 2 and August 7, but it remained in Turkish control for the rest of the campaign.
Cemetery construction.
The cemetery was constructed in 1919, and the remains recovered from the surrounding area here buried there. Special memorials commemorate ten Australian soldiers thought to be amongst its 449 unidentified burials.

Steven Weissman

Steven Weissman (b. June 4, 1968, in California) is an award-winning alternative cartoonist best known for his offbeat and bizarre explorations of childhood friendships (not to mention competitiveness and mutual enmity). He has been published by Alternative Comics and Fantagraphics, and has had his work translated into French and Japanese.
Yikes.
Weissman made his name with the Harvey and Ignatz award-nominated 1997 series "Yikes" (volume II), published by Alternative Comics. It features the light-hearted adventures of a gang of kids, very much in the Little Rascals mold, who just happen to be "monsters" — vampires, zombies, and the like. "Yikes" ran for two issues, and has since been collected, with previous self-published "Yikes" comics, in "Don't Call Me Stupid" and "Mean", both put out by Fantagraphics.
Barack Hussein Obama.
In 2009, Weissman began a webcomic called Barack Hussein Obama featuring the president, his cabinet and family. All the characters have the same names and faces but live in an alternate dimension, living their lives and US government roles in different ways. Fantagraphics published the strips as a graphic novel in September 2012 and the strip continues on the website What Things Do.
Other work.
Besides "Yikes", Weissman drew two other titles for Alternative, "Tykes" and "The Lemon Kids".
In 1999, he moved to Fantagraphics, where he has published a series of collections and original graphic novels, including "Champs", "White Flower Day", and "Chewing Gum in Church". Fantagraphics published a collection of his current weekly strip, "Barack Hussein Obama", shortly before Election Day, 2012.
In addition to his work for Alternative and Fantagraphics, Weissman has done comics for Last Gasp, Marvel (where he created "Mini-Marvels"), DC, Dark Horse, What Things Do, Vice and "Nickelodeon Magazine".
Influences.
Weissman has cited the Japanese "super deformed" tradition, Hal Roach's "Our Gang" shorts, Shirley Temple movies, Abbott and Costello, and Sunday morning TV as influences; though his primary influence is Charles M. Schulz's "Peanuts". He also mentions cartoonists Dan Clowes and Mike Allred as influences on his approach to color (which tends to be simple two-color treatments).
Awards.
Weissman was awarded the 1998 Harvey Award for Best New Talent. He was nominated for a 1997 Ignatz Award for Promising New Talent; and was nominated for a 1998 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Series, for his title "Yikes" (Alternative Comics).
Personal life.
Weissman lived in San Francisco in the late 1990s, where he associated with fellow cartoonists/illustrators Ed Brubaker, Brian Biggs, Josh Neufeld, and Mats!? (with whom he shared a studio space). Weissman currently lives in the Los Angeles neighborhood of "Little Armenia" with his wife Charissa Chu and their son Charles.

1987–89 Tibetan unrest

The 1987–1989 Tibetan unrest were a series of pro-independence protests that took place between September 1987 and March 1989 in the Tibetan areas in the People's Republic of China: Sichuan, Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai, and the Tibetan prefectures in Yunnan and Gansu. The largest demonstrations began on 5 March 1989 in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, when a group of monks, nuns, and laypeople took to the streets as the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising approached. Police and security officers attempted to put down the protests, but as tensions escalated an even greater crowd of protesters amassed. After three days of violence, martial law was declared on 8 March 1989, and foreign journalists and tourists were expelled from Tibet on 10 March. Reports of deaths and military force being used against protesters were prominent. Numbers of the dead are unknown.

Pioneer High School (San Jose, California)

Pioneer High School is a public high school located in the Blossom Valley district of San Jose, California. It is one of six high schools in the San Jose Unified School District, and is a science magnet school with an interdisciplinary focus on community service and service learning. It was nominated for California Distinguished School awards in 2008, 2006, 2000, and 1996.
Academics.
Pioneer High School is a California Public High School, and therefore has to abide by rules and regulations set forth by the California State Government. Each student has a certain amount of unit requirements under different categories that they must complete in order to graduate. There are a number of accelerated and Advanced Placement classes students can choose from, as well as mock trial and radio broadcasting extra-curricular activities that they can choose to be involved in. The yearbook was a semi-finalist in the year 2006, and in the 2006-2007 school year the yearbook was chosen as the national sample.
Pioneer High School has received 4 California Distinguished School awards (1996,2000,2006,and 2008), has been awarded the Santa Clara County Top Ten High School award, and has been listed in the Mercury News as a National Service Learning Leader School from 1998-2006. The school's Academic Performance index in 2007 was 801/1000, putting it in the top 20% of schools and classifying it under the "Very High Performing School" category. Pioneer has never failed to achieve the growth goals expected of them under the No Child Left Behind Act.
Service Learning Focus.
Pioneer High School focuses on community service and service learning as part of its mission statement. To supplement this focus, the school requires all sophomore students to participate in a "Sophomore Project", a venture that demands a minimum of 30 hours of community service in the span of a couple of months. In most cases, students exceed this amount, sometimes even exceeding hundreds of hours, in which case they are presented a Presidential Award for Service. Many students claim that the Sophomore Project assignment is the most challenging part of attending Pioneer High School.
During their Senior year, students are again given the opportunity to participate in a service learning project when they are introduced to the "Senior Exhibition" assignment. Students may complete multiple hours of personal or community work in order to obtain extra credits. The Senior Exhibition project is not mandatory, but students that complete it are rewarded a graduation cord.
Athletics.
Pioneer Mustangs Athletics are generally known for being a strong force within the BVAL league of the Central Coast Section. The Athletic Department, headed by Joe Berticevich, has experienced much success over the past decade. Perhaps the sport Pioneer is most known for is its football team. Pioneer football has achieved multiple winning seasons in the Mount Hamilton division of BVAL over the past decade, and continually competes with private schools of a much higher caliber.

Maharam's theorem

In mathematics, Maharam's theorem is a deep result about the decomposability of measure spaces, which plays an important role in the theory of Banach spaces. In brief, it states that every complete measure space is decomposable into "non-atomic parts" (copies of products of the unit interval [0,1] on the reals), and "purely atomic parts", using the counting measure on some discrete space. The theorem is due to Dorothy Maharam.
It was extended to localizable measure spaces by Irving Segal.
The result is important to classical Banach space theory, in that, when considering the Banach space given as an Lp space of measurable functions over a general measurable space, it is sufficient to understand it in terms of its decomposition into non-atomic and atomic parts.
Maharam's theorem can also be translated in the language of abelian von Neumann algebras. Every abelian von Neumann algebra is isomorphic to a product of σ-finite abelian von Neumann algebras, and every σ-finite abelian von Neumann algebra is isomorphic to a spatial tensor product of discrete abelian von Neumann algebras, i.e., algebras of bounded functions on a discrete set.
A similar theorem is given by Kuratowski for Polish spaces, stating that they are isomorphic, as Borel sets, to either the reals, the integers, or a finite set.

10th Panzer Division (Bundeswehr)

The 10th Armoured Division (German:" 10. Panzerdivision") is an armoured division of the German Army, part of the "Bundeswehr". 
Its staff is based at Sigmaringen. The division is a unit of the German Army's stabilization forces and specializes in conflicts of low intensity.
History.
This division was founded as the "10. Panzerdivision" of the new German Army in 1959. Originally only consisting of armoured units, it is now also superordinate to Germany's last mountain warfare unit. For this reason the "Edelweiss" badge has become another commonly used insignia to denote allegiance to this formation. The 10th Armoured Division is a part of Germany's permanent contribution to Eurocorps, the other being the German contribution to the Franco-German Brigade which was subordinate to the division until 2006.
After 1993 troops of this division participated in numerous overseas deployments. Among them were the first out-of-area land deployment operations for the "Bundeswehr" (in fact of any German military unit after World War II). Troops were deployed to Somalia (UNOSOM II) from 1993 to 1994 and to Bosnia and Herzegovina (IFOR) from 1995 to 1996 and stayed in this country until 1998 (SFOR). Soldiers of the 10th Armoured Division's SFOR contingent were also involved in the "Bundeswehr"'s first combat operation in 1997 (Operation Libelle). In 2000, the 10th Armoured Division deployed more than 8,000 personnel to the Balkans. Between 2002 and 2003, it deployed to various operations in the Balkans and in Afghanistan.
Its designation ("10. Panzerdivision") and the name of its HQ garrison ("Graf-Stauffenberg-Kaserne") is a historical reference to key members of the German Resistance and July 20 Plot who had served in the preceding 1939-1943 10. Panzer Division of Germany's Wehrmacht during World War II.

Gunlom Falls

Gunlom Falls is a waterfall located in Kakadu National Park, in the Northern Territory, Australia. It is also known as UDP Falls or Waterfall Creek. The falls are situated in the Mary River area in the southern, less visited part of Kakadu. It is perhaps most famous for making an appearance in the movie "Crocodile Dundee". 
Depending on the time of the year, Gunlom Falls is anything between a roaring waterfall and a gentle trickle falling down the cliffs. This plunge pool at the bottom of the falls is one of the most picturesque places at Kakadu and a popular swimming hole free of saltwater crocodiles. A steep 15-minute climb leads to the top of the falls, with spectacular views over the southern region of the park. There is also a series of swimming holes at the top of the falls that are popular. 
Gunlom is about a 40 km drive from the Kakadu Highway on a gravel road, just inside the southern entry to the park. During the wet season (December to April), access is restricted. There is also a campground located near the falls.

Electronic visual display

An electronic visual display is display technology which incorporates flat panel displays, performs as a video display, output device for presentation of images transmitted electronically, for visual reception, without producing a permanent record.
Common applications for "electronic visual displays" used to be television sets or computer monitors, but these days "electronic visual displays" tend to be ubiquitous as interface for large amounts of visual information in mobile computing applications like portable information communication technology devices. They can also be found in digital signage.
Classification.
Electronic visual displays present visual information according to the electrical input signal (analog or digital) either by emitting light (then they are called "active displays") or, alternatively, by modulating available light during the process of reflection or transmission (light modulators are called "passive displays").
Display mode of observation.
Electronic visual displays can be observed directly ("direct view display") or the displayed information can be projected to a screen (transmissive or reflective screen). This usually happens with smaller displays at a certain magnification. 
A different kind of projection display is the class of "laser projection displays" where the image is build up sequentially either via line by line scanning or by writing one complete column at a time. For that purpose one beam is formed from three lasers operating at the primary colors and this beam is scanned electro-mechanically (galvanometer scanner, micro-mirror array)) or electro-acousto-optically.
Layout of picture elements.
Depending on the shape and on the arrangement of the picture elements of a display either fixed information ca be displayed (symbols, signs), simple numerals (7-segment layout) or arbitrary shapes can be formed (dot-matrix displays).
Emission and control of colors.
Colors can be generated by selective emission, by selective absorption, transmission or by selective reflection.
Addressing modes.
Each sub-pixel of a display devices must be selected (addressed) in order to be energized in a controlled way.

Biography.
Early years.
Maynard was one of six children to Samuel C. Maynard and Robertine Isola Greaves, both immigrants from Barbados. At 16 years old, he dropped out of Brooklyn High School to pursue his passion for writing. Maynard became friends with influential New York writers James Baldwin and Langston Hughes and later acknowledged Martin Luther King, Jr. as a hero.
Career.
Maynard's career in journalism began in 1961 at "York Gazette & Daily" in York, Pennsylvania. In 1966, he received a Nieman Fellowship to Harvard University and joined the editorial staff of the "Washington Post" the following year.
In 1979, Maynard took over as editor of "The Oakland Tribune" and became the first African American to own a major metropolitan newspaper after purchasing the paper four years later. He is widely recognized for turning around the then struggling newspaper and transforming it into a 1990 Pulitzer Prize-winning journal.
Maynard greatly valued community involvement. He taught at local high schools and frequently attended community forums. His positive, proactive outlook helped many in need, including children of cocaine-addicted mothers and earthquake and firestorm victims. Maynard used the outreach of his newspaper to better the community by pushing for improved schools, trauma care centers, and economic development.
In 1977, Maynard co-founded the Institute for Journalism Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to training journalists of color and providing accurate representation of minorities in the news media. For more than thirty years, the Institute has trained over 1,000 journalists and editors from multicultural backgrounds across the United States.
Personal life.
The Institute he co-founded with his second wife Nancy Hicks Maynard (1947–2008) was renamed in his honor after his death from prostate cancer in 1993. His daughter, Dori J. Maynard, has since become president and CEO of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education.

First African Baptist Church and Parsonage (Scott County, Kentucky)

First African Baptist Church and Parsonage is an historically significant church building and an associated parsonage located in the United States on West Jefferson Avenue in Georgetown, Kentucky. In 1842, First Baptist Church moved from their West Jefferson location to a site closer to Georgetown College on College and Hamilton Streets. The church's previous building and property were leased to local black Baptists so a new congregation solely for blacks could be formed. The current building was constructed in 1870. The buildings were added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984.
History.
The First Baptist Church congregation in Georgetown, Kentucky was organized in 1811, and its first meeting house erected on West Jefferson Street in 1815. In 1842 Howard Malcom, the pastor of the church and president of Georgetown College, urged the relocation of the church to a site near the college. The congregation moved from their West Jefferson location to a site on College and Hamilton Streets. The building at the original site was leased to black congregation. G. W. Dupee, a slave, was the first official pastor of the black congregation. Reuben Lee was pastor when the current building was constructed in 1870.
Architecture.
The church building has a Gothic Revival style. The original twin doors to accommodate women and men separately entering have been closed on the front facade and replaced with "a single centered entrance highlighted by three lancet arches."

Ivo Snijders (born 9 September 1980 in Mijdrecht) is a rower from the Netherlands.
Snijders started rowing in 1995 and made his international senior debut in the lightweight fours at the 2000 World Championships in Zagreb. Together with Gerard van der Linden, Dylan van der Linde and Coen Eggenkamp he finished on the 9th position. Without Van der Linden, but with Tristan Kramers they improved their result to a fifth position in the 2001 Rowing World Cup meeting in Munich. The quartet finished in 7th position at the World Championships in Luzern after winning the B-final. In 2002 Snijders totally focused on the lightweight double sculls together with Gerard van der Linden. They became ninth and seventh in the World Cup meetings in Hazewinkel and Luzern before winning the silver medal at the Under-23 World Championships. At the senior World Championships in Sevilla they became 10th.
Snijders, Van der Linden, Karel Dormans as well as Joeri de Groot started a new adventure in the lightweight coxless fours in 2003, finishing second in the Munich World Cup and fourth in Luzern. These pre tournament results earned them a place for the World Championships in Milan where they won the silver medal. Their next aim was to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics and with a seventh place in Poznan, a fourth in Munich and a fifth in Luzern they succeeded and they could pack their bags for Athens. They aimed for a medal at the Olympics, but came just short and had to be satisfied with a fourth place.
Snijders decided to stop with rowing, but made a comeback in 2007 when he entered a lightweight fours boat with Wolter Blankert, Arnoud Greidanus and Gerard van der Linden in Linz where they finished in fourth position. With Roeland Lievens and Paul1 Drewes as replacements of Blankert and Greidanus they improved their result to a third place in Luzern and they created some high expectations for the World Championships in Munich. They could not keep up with the expectations and only finished in a tenth position in Germany.
For the 2008 season he rowed with Greidanus, Van der Linden and Marshall Godschalk to an eight place at the World Cup in Munich. After they finished ninth in Luzern Greidanus was replaced by Paul Drewes and in Poznan they rowed to a fifth place, which meant qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Clingstone

Clingstone is a house built in 1905, perched atop a small, rocky island in an island group called "The Dumplings" in Narragansett Bay, near Jamestown, Rhode Island.
Architecture.
The dwelling, designed by Philadelphia socialite J. S. Lovering Wharton and artist William Trost Richards, is a three-story 23-room 10,000-square-foot shingle-style cottage. The structural system of heavy mill-type framing was designed to withstand hurricane force winds. The name "Clingstone" was suggested by a remark that it was "a peach of a house". In August 2010 the interior was documented in a series of panoramic photographs.
Wes Anderson, the director, modeled the house from Moonrise Kingdom after the interior of Clingstone, specifically the interior shingles of Clingstone. 
Owners.
The original owner, relative of industrialist Joseph Wharton, built the house in response to the government condemning his earlier summer home in order to build Fort Wetherill. Wharton summered there until his death in the 1930s. Heavily damaged by a hurricane in 1938, the residence was vacant from the time of his wife's death in 1941 until it was purchased in 1961 by Boston architect Henry Wood. Wood, a distant cousin of the Philadelphia Whartons, was able to purchase the property for $3,500, the amount owed in back taxes. The house is known by locals as "The House on a Rock".

Ross Tavern

The Ross Tavern is a historic building at 52 Jeffrey's Neck Road in Ipswich, Massachusetts. Now a private residence, the building was moved to its present site from central Ipswich (adjacent to the Choate Bridge) in 1940, and carefully restored to a First Period appearance. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
The building has a complicated history, in part because it includes parts of two different structures. A house was built c. 1690 in downtown Ipswich, and moved near the Choat Bridge in 1735. This house, known as the Ross Tavern, remained at that site until it was disassembled and moved to Jeffrey's Neck by Daniel Wendell, an amateur architectural historian, in 1940. Nothing is known of its original owners. Wendell joined the tavern to a second house, the c. 1675-1700 Lord-Collins House, that he also moved to the site. This house is one of a very few First Period homes to provide evidence of a transom window.

Crackle tube

A crackle tube is a type of plasma lamp that is used most commonly in museums, night clubs, movie sets, and other applications where its appearance may be appealing for entertainment. Such a device consists of a double walled glass tube with a hollow center. The cavity between the inner and outer glass tubes is filled with thousands of small phosphor coated glass beads. A 5–14 kV transformer sends a very low power, high frequency electrostatic discharge into the bead filled cavity, producing filaments of light that simulate lightning. Crackle tubes get their name not because of the sound they produce but rather because of the appearance of their internal behavior. The "lightning" (filaments or streamers) is forced around and in between the phosphor-coated glass beads, due to the beads' dielectric nature. In so doing, the phosphor is excited by the electrical energy and fluoresces producing visible light. Like plasma globes, crackle tubes respond to touch; the filaments appear to be "attracted" toward the point of contact and usually become more luminous (brighter) as the electricity is grounded. The tubes are also filled with a noble gas like neon, argon, or xenon which acts as the electron transfer medium of the cavity. The gas is typically kept at only slightly above atmospheric pressure. 
Typically, crackle tubes are cylindrical in geometry, however, they can be made into virtually any solid shape, even flat plates (trademarked by the name "Luminglas" ). The filaments can also be made to any color by combining different chemicals with the base phosphor. The chemical that is used to produce blue filaments is also responsive to ultraviolet light. UV light may have something to do with how the phosphor is excited by the ESF (electrostatic field). The filaments themselves can change color as they progress along the length of the tube. This effect is created by using glass beads with different chemical coatings on them, and the color of the filament changes as the ESD transitions from one color layer to another. Chemical coatings can also be combined onto a single coating, allowing for a crackle tube to have multiple simultaneous filaments of several different colors.
Crackle tubes appear white when viewed in their off state under normal lighting conditions. Their luminosity, or light intensity, depends on several factors, but generally crackle tubes are not very bright when compared to a fluorescent light or incandescent lamp. Still, they are quite bright compared to similar devices. However, they are best viewed in darkness. Their transformers can also be linked to an acoustic modulator, allowing the tubes to 'respond' to music or ambient noise.

The Rowley Village Forge Site is a historic colonia-era iron foundry site in Boxford, Massachusetts. The first iron forge in the area was established on Fish Brook in 1668 by Henry Leonard of the Leonard family, who were instrumental in the Saugus Iron Works further south. This business ran until about 1681, but the site also saw industrial uses into the 19th century, with sawmills and gristmills quickly replacing the foundry after it failed. Remnants of these works are visible from trails through conservation land off Lockwood Drive.

Salem Common Historic District (Salem, Massachusetts)

Salem Common Historic District is a historic district bounded roughly by St. Peter's, Bridge, and Derby Sts. and Collins Cove in Salem, Massachusetts.
The Common was founded in the 17th century. Before 1800 there was no enclosing fence and livestock were free to roam across it. The present wrought iron fence around the Common was built in 1850 and has undergone restoration. The white archway that stands near the north entrance was originally a design of Samuel McIntire, but it had to be removed because of its condition. The current archway is a replica established in 1976.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and further expanded in 2002. The district boundaries include the Essex Institute Historic District, a cluster of buildings along Essex and Brown Streets owned by the Peabody Essex Museum.
Close to the Salem Common Historic District is the Chestnut Street District with grand Federal Mansions designed in the Federal architecture style that trace the roots to the Old China Trade with many designed by Samuel Mcintire. Other nearby historic districts are the Federal Street District, Downtown Salem District, Charter Street Historic District, Salem Willows Historic District, Crombie Street District, Derby Waterfront District, Bridge Street Neck Historic District and the Salem Maritime National Historic Site, consists of 12 historic structures and about 9 acres (36,000 m2) of land along the waterfront in Salem and is the first American National Historic Site, and interprets the triangular trade during the colonial period; privateers during the American Revolution; and sea trade, especially with the Far East, after independence.
Joseph Story House.
The Joseph Story House was built in 1811 for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story. The house is a National Historic Landmark located at 26 Winter Street and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
Andrew-Safford House.
The Andrew–Safford House was built in 1819 and was designed in the Federal style by an unknown architect for a wealthy Russian fur merchant. It is located at 13 Washington Square and owned by the Peabody Essex Museum, and when constructed was reputed to have been the most costly house erected in the United States to that date. The massive vertical façade and the four large columns rising from the ground to the third story on the south side make this one of the most impressive houses in Salem. The house is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of this district, and is also part of the Essex Institute Historic District.
John Bertram House.
Originally built for John Forrester in 1818-19, this Federal Mansion is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. [http://www.salemweb.com/tales/structures.shtml] Captain John Bertram purchased the Federal mansion from John Forrester and later sold it to George Peabody in 1834. George Peabody lived in the mansion for 60 years and while there made the mansion larger by an addition of the one-story dining room. Around 1930 the home was purchased by the estate of Captain John Bertram & is now called the John Bertram House and is now a home for the elderly.
Salem as the Birthplace of the National Guard.
In 1637 the first muster on Salem Common took place where for the first time, a regiment of militia drilled for the common defense of a multi-community area, thus laying the foundation for what became the Army National Guard.
On August the 19th 2010, the Governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, signed HB1145, "An Act Designating the City of Salem as the Birthplace of the National Guard." This is the first step and then was later approved by the House in Washington in March 2012. President Barack Obama on the 10th of January 2013 signed executive order HR1339 "which designates the City of Salem, Mass., as the birthplace of the U.S. National Guard."
Each April, the Second Corps of Cadets gather in front of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, where their founder, Stephen Abbott, is buried. They lay a wreath, play "Taps" and fire a 21-gun salute. In another annual commemoration, soldiers gather at Old Salem Armory to honor soldiers who were killed in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. On April 14, 2012 Salem celebrated the 375th anniversary of the first muster on Salem Common with over More than 1,000 troops taking part in ceremonies and a parade.

Saugus Town Hall

Saugus Town Hall is a historic town hall on Central Street in Saugus, Massachusetts. It was built in 1875 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
Construction.
In 1874, construction began on Saugus' second and present town hall. The cornerstone was laid on October 17, 1874. The day's exercises began with a procession from Sutton Hall up Chestnut Street, through Winter and Central Streets, up Main Street, through Summer Street, down Pleasant Street, and down Central Street to the site of the Town Hall. The Rev. Mr. Allen delivered an invocation and then the stone was laid by members of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. The East Saugus Brass Band provided music. Harmon Hall then made the introductory remarks. Nathaniel P. Banks followed with an oration. Wilbur F. Newhall made the closing remarks. The exercises ended with a benediction by Rev. F. V. Tenney.
Saugus Town Hall was built on a low, wet piece of land purchased from Samuel A. Parker. The land was filled at great expense and construction of the town hall put Saugus in a $50,000 debt. This was one of the reasons that the neighborhood of East Saugus sought to be set off from Saugus and annexed to the city of Lynn. East Saugus was unable to get a bill in both houses of the state legislature, and the issue was dropped after the town appropriated $5,000 for the laying of water pipes through East Saugus.
The building was officially dedicated on March 1, 1877. It was attended by residents from Saugus as well as from surrounding communities. Seated on the stage were dignitaries from Saugus and Lynn, including the Saugus Board of Selectmen, Lynn mayor Samuel M. Bubier, and former Lynn mayors James N. Buffum and Hiram N. Breed. The dedicatory address was given by Wendell Phillips. Mayor Buffum then made a speech and was followed by Building Committee Chairman E. P. Robinson, who made a brief speech followed by a formal handing over of the building's keys to Board of Selectmen Chairman E. W. Newhall, who also spoke. The hymn Old 100th was then sung and Rev. Samuel Jackson ended the ceremony with a benediction.
Layout.
The first floor originally housed the selectmen, town clerk, and town treasurer's offices, as well as the school committee room, a high school classroom, and the public library. The high school and library have since moved to their own buildings and the school committee room is now located in the School Administration Building. The second story originally served as a community room that hosted everything a number of events including town meetings, political rallies, high school graduations, plays, boxing matches, puppet shows, firemen's balls, banquets, and school dances. It was later divided into offices for the accounting, financing, public works and personnel/purchasing departments. When the Town Hall was renovated in 1997, the second floor once again became an assembly room. The basement housed the town's police department and jail until a police station was constructed in 1936.
Notable events.
On March 14, 1892, town collector William F. Hitchings died during the Annual Town Meeting. He was distributing copies of a circular addressing an inaccuracy he had made when he suddenly dropped dead.
In 1922, Private Winslow Hodgson laid in state after his body returned from burial in France. The local American Legion post wanted to hold the lying in state on a date the conflicted with a dance held by the Saugus Canoe and Tennis Club. The club chose not to postpone its dance, citing short notice and the great expense that had gone into the event. Members of the Legion stood outside of the dance with a banner that read "Enjoy Yourselves Dancing While The Body Of A Dead Solider Lies In The Morgue".
On October 31, 1927, a fire in the basement of the town hall caused $5000 in damages. The fire started in the cell room of the police headquarters and ate through the floors and partitions of the building. Police officers and firemen were able to save the town's irreplaceable documents, books, and articles.
In 1929, Marchioness Townshend, mayor of King's Lynn, visited Saugus Town Hall on her visit to the town. The Marchioness, who was visiting the area as part of Lynn, Massachusetts' tercentenary celebration, also visited the Boardman House and the Saugus Iron Works while in Saugus.
From August 26 to August 28, 1932, the body of John Burke, a soldier killed in Tientsin, China laid in state at the town hall.
From December 8 to 11, 1947, the body of Staff Sergeant Arthur F. DeFranzo laid in state at the town hall. DeFranzo was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.
In 1975, $30,000 in municipal funds (about $19,000 in cash and $11,000 in checks) were stolen from a vault the Collector–Treasurer's office. The theft occurred two weeks after a set of keys was taken from a custodian who had left them in a ladies room door. Town Manager Maurice Cunningham could not explain why the money had not been deposited in a local bank as it usually was.
Renovation.
In 1976, the building underwent renovation. The rear portion of the building was reconditioned and aluminium siding was installed. In 1977, the building was painted and the broken slate tiles on the roof were replaced.
By the 1990s the town hall had fallen into disrepair and the town proposed tearing it down. However, the Saugus Historical Commission pushed to save and restore the building. The town's Capital Improvement Plan included funding for its renovation. In 1998, The Friends of Town Hall was formed to raise money to complete several projects not covered by the plan. This included the purchase of a piano for functions in the town hall auditorium, installation of display cases exhibiting historic items on the first floor, and the dedication of "The Founding of Saugus Mural" in the Town Hall auditorium. The town hall was closed during the renovations and the offices were moved to the former high school extension building on Main Street.
A reopening ceremony was held on November 17, 1998. Board of Selectmen chairman Janette Fasano served as the master of ceremonies and delivered the opening and closing remarks. Father John Mulloy delivered the invocation. Town Manager Steven Angelo, former town manager Richard Cardillo, Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin, Historical Commission chairman Stephen Carlson, United States Representative John F. Tierney, Massachusetts Senate President Tom Birmingham, and State Senator Edward J. Clancy, Jr. spoke. Selectmen Richard Barry, Jon Bernard, Chris Ciampa, and Anthony Cogliano also made remarks. Reverend Gregg Messerole delivered the benediction. 
In total, the renovations cost $3.5 million.

Shawsheen Village Historic District

Shawsheen Village Historic District is a historic district in northern Andover, Massachusetts. Shawsheen Village was completed in the early 1920s as a planned corporate community. Conceived by William Madison Wood of the American Woolen Company, the village was designed a team of architects including Adden & Parker, Clifford Allbright, Ripley and LeBoutillier and James E. Allen. John Franklin, a civil engineer for the American Woolen Company was responsible for designing the village, under the direction of Wood. Buildings from the original Frye Village were also incorporated into the design which included a railroad station, shops, apartment buildings, factories, parks and numerous single-family dwellings. The village was located just up the road from the Company's main factories in nearby Lawrence. 
The village was roughly divided into three sections. The westernmost of these sections, around the junction of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28) with Massachusetts Route 133 (Lowell Street to the west, Haverhill Street to the east), was the village center, with shops, a post office. Immediately east of this area, descending to the Shawsheen River, was the industrial area. One residential area was primarily north and west of this central area, and it provided housing for the upper level executives of the Company. The third area was east and south of the industrial area, spilling across the railroad tracks and river, where middle class worker housing was provided. Sprinkled throughout were old houses from the Frye Village settlement that were relocated according to Wood's vision.
Although the company community was well conceived, it was short lived. William Wood committed suicide in 1926, and the single ownership strategy of the community began to fall apart. Most of the company's properties were purchased by a realty trust in 1932 and resold, often to the tenants of the property. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

This is because the present-day refuge was for decades slated as the site for an enormous, master-planned community named, in various iterations, "Pontchartrain", "Orlandia" and "New Orleans East". Three interchanges with I-10 were constructed to accommodate the development; two of the three were never used and appear as "ghost exits" to contemporary motorists.
Wildlife.
An enormous wading bird rookery can be found in the swamps of the refuge from May until July, while tens of thousands of waterfowl winter in its marshes.
The brown pelican is an endangered species and is a year-round resident of southeast Louisiana. The number of nesting brown pelicans has substantially increased despite loss of nesting habitat. Brown pelicans are frequent users of the refuge. Several bald eagles, another threatened species, visit the refuge each year. 
Other wildlife include waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds, marsh rabbits, white pelicans, alligators, and other raptors, game and small mammals, reptiles and amphibians
Habitat.
The refuge contains a variety of different habitats, including freshwater and brackish marshes, bottomland hardwood forests, lagoons, canals, borrow pits, chenieres (former beach fronts) and natural bayous. The marshes along Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne serve as estuarine nurseries for various fish species, crabs and shrimp. Freshwater lagoons, bayous and ponds serve as production areas for largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill and catfish. The diverse habitats meet the needs of 340 bird species during various seasons of the year. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 use the wetland areas during the fall, winter, and early spring months.

The Hazadiah Smith House is a historic First Period house at 337 Cabot Street in Beverly, Massachusetts. The 2.5 story wood frame house was built c. 1686, probably by Hazadiah Smith, whose profession is frequently listed in contemporary records as a builder or housewright. It is possible that he was responsible for a number of surviving First Period houses that survive in Beverly. This particular house, which he is believed to have lived in, was built with a two cell center chimney plan, and then extended to the rear at a later date, replacing the roof and leaving the chimney protruding from the front roof slope.

South Green Historic District (Ipswich, Massachusetts)

The South Green Historic District encompasses one of the oldest central civic parts of Ipswich, Massachusetts. The town's South Green was laid out in 1686, and is now the heart of a collection of historic properties dating from the 17th to the 19th century. The centerpiece of the district is the green itself, and its most notable associated property is the John Whipple House, a National Historic Landmark and museum. The district boundaries extend from the junction of South Main and Elm Streets, southward past the green to where County Road (Massachusetts Route 1A) crosses Saltonstall's Creek.
Ipswich voted to establish the South Green in 1686, after which it was used as a common grazing area, and as a training ground for the local militia. It was also the site of Ipswich's earliest school buildings, which even predated the establishment of the green as a common area. The first schoolhouse was built in the area in 1652; it was moved to the Meetinghouse Green in 1704, at which time private education continued in the area. A public school was again introduced to the South Green area in 1794, which became the English High School from 1836 to 1874.
Most of the surviving structures in the district are houses. The oldest is the c. 1653 Whipple House, which was moved to the area in the 1930s. The green is flanked by buildings dating through the 19th century, in a variety of styles. The predominant styles are Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival, although there are several later Victorian properties. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Calbia

Calbia is a fictional country found in the Doc Savage novel "The King Maker" (1934).
Calbia is a small Balkan nation in southeastern Europe. It lies on the Adriatic Sea and is bordered by Greece, Albania, Macedonia, Serbia, and Montenegro. There are farmlands in the valleys and some flatlands. Otherwise it is heavily forested, usually with firs, and mountainous. The nation is largely undeveloped, though not a poor nation. One section of Calbia is rich in petroleum fields and dotted with oil wells. Asphalt roads, air fields, and development derived from this petroleum money were spreading throughout the nation in the 1930s. 
Calbia had an army, air force, and nascent navy.
The capital of Calbia is San Blazna. The city streets are generally narrow, walled in by a profusion of houses built over the centuries. San Blazna lies on the River Carlos, named after the founder of the royal dynasty of Calbia, which is crossed by two large bridges. In the center of San Blazna on the left bank of the River Carlos is an ancient castle which serves as the king's palace. In medieval times the river was diverted into a moat around the castle. This moat is surrounded by a large esplanade which serves as the main promenade of the capital. In one part of town is an ancient stone house, now a national museum, which was the peasant home of the first King Le Galbin. Out the very outskirts of the capital is an old graystone citadel, a simple structure of one domed tower complete with subterranean dungeons, which was constructed by the first king of Calbia perhaps for defensive military reasons.
The Calbian language is a dialect of Slavic-romance languages, the latter probably due to its proximity to Italy.
Calbia is a kingdom, ruled by a dynastic monarchy. The King of Calbia in 1934 at the time of "The King Maker" is Dal Le Galbin. However, the nation was forward thinking and had progressive political movements such as democratic parties and a Calbia National Women's Suffrage League.
Researcher Thomas Fortenberry has suggested that Calbia is the model for another fictional country, Latveria found in the Marvel Universe. The action of "The King Maker" may also form the basis for the Marvel Comics supervillain character Doctor Doom, especially when combined with another Doc Savage villain, John Sunlight. Furthermore, Fortenberry contends that "The King Maker" is the origin of the fictional nation of Novenia, found in the Prince Zarkon series by Lin Carter. This series was a self-admitted pastiche in honor of Doc Savage.

Samuil (village)

Samuil ( ; ) is a village in northeastern Bulgaria, part of Razgrad Province, located in the geographic region of Ludogorie. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Samuil Municipality, which lies in the southeastern part of the Province. As of December 2009, the village has a population of 1,543 inhabitants.
Samuil lies among the Samuil Heights in the Ludogorie Plateau, near the second highest hill in the Danubian Plain (501 metres). The population consists of Bulgarians, Turks and Romani. The area was inhabited by the Getae and the Romans in Antiquity and by the Slavs and Bulgars in the Middle Ages. It was part of the First Bulgarian Empire and the Second Bulgarian Empire, but fell under Ottoman rule as early as 1388. The construction of Baron Hirsch's Rousse-Kaspichan-Varna railway line in 1867-1868 turned the small village of "Ishiklar" into a railway station of local importance, with the first settlers being Greek merchants and harvesters. After the Liberation of Bulgaria, many Bulgarians settled in the village, which was renamed to "Gara Samuil" ("Samuil Station") and then to "Samuil" in honour of the medieval tsar Samuil of Bulgaria.
Municipality.
Samuil municipality covers an area of 250 square kilometres and includes the following 14 places:
Ethnic Turks constitute 75% of the population, Bulgarians being 14% and Roma 11%.

Spicket Falls Historic District

The Spicket Falls Historic District encompasses the historic industrial and commercial heart of Methuen, Massachusetts, and one of the lower Merrimack River's best-preserved 19th century mill complexes. It is centered on the falls of the Spicket River, from which the 19th century textile mills of Methuen derived their power. The historic district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, includes commercial and civic buildings in and near Gaunt Square, the heart of the city, and along both sides of the Spicket River between Gaunt Square and the Boston and Maine Railroad tracks south of the river. It abuts the residential Pleasant-High Historic District, which lies to its east.
The falls of the Spicket River were the site of small scale industrial works in the 18th century, but the area did not begin to take shape as the town center until larger-scale development began in the 1820s. The oldest buildings that survive are brick buildings constructed in 1825 and 1826, when the main "A" mill was built. The complex was expanded in the 1840s with the construction of a wood frame cotton processing mill and a brick warehouse near the railroad. Industrial David Nevins added six more buildings and a new dam between 1879 and 1882.
The city center's growth along Broadway and the Gaunt Square area mirrored the expansion of the mills over time. The area had long been a stop on the north-south route, and hotels and taverns dating from the middle 19th century survive, including the Masonic Hall, which was formerly a hotel. The old brick town hall, from whose parking lot fine views of the Spicket valley are seen, was built in 1853 with Greek Revival styling. Notable early 20th century additions to the area include the central fire station (1899, Romanesque Revival), the Oddfellows' Hall (1904, Renaissance Revival), and the 1909 railroad station, built in Queen Anne style with funds donated by philanthropist Edward Searles.

New Standard D-25

__NOTOC__
The New Standard D-25 was a 5-seat agricultural and joy-riding aircraft produced in the USA from 1928.
Construction.
The D-25 was constructed from Duralumin angles channels and tees bolted and rivetted together for the fuselage and Spruce spars with bass wood and plywood built-up ribs, all fabric covered. The D series was quite distinctive in having sesquiplane wings with the upper wing, of much bigger span and chord, supported on tall cabane and interplane struts.
Operational use.
Seating for four passengers was provided in the open front cockpit, described as "chummy", with the pilot in the single seat open rear cockpit. Variations in seating arrangement reflected the role of the different variants. The rugged structure gave the New Standard Ds a long-life, leading to the respectable number that survived the abuse of joy-riding, mail carrying and crop dusting for many years. 
Two D-25As that had been confiscated off smugglers were acquired by the US Coast Guard in 1935, designated NT-2.
Survivors.
Seven New Standards survived in 2007. Airworthy D-25s include two at Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome Museum, New York, and two that operate joy rides from the Fantasy of Flight at Polk City, Florida. NC7286 was recently restored and is operated by Biplane Rides Over Atlanta at Dekalb-Peachtree Airport (KPDK). Additionally N930V operates on the west coast as of early 2008 and N9194 was recently completely restored and deemed airworthy again in May 2009.

In 2008, Globalive successfully made a purchase in Industry Canada's radio spectrum auction, allowing the company to launch a national cell phone network in Canada.
Globalive's plans were cast into doubt by an unfavourable decision by Canada's telecommunications regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which ruled that the company failed to meet regulatory requirements for Canadian ownership.
On December 11, 2009, Tony Clement, the Industry Minister, overturned the CRTC decision, allowing Globalive to enter the Canadian cell phone market.
Orascom Telecom Holding, an Egypt based company, owns 65 per cent of the equity issued by Globalive Wireless and most of the debt.
On August 11, 2009 Globalive announced their new brand identity for the wireless services as Wind Mobile, which was launched on December 16, 2009 in Toronto, a few days after the federal government's announcement of the 'varied' CRTC decision.
Globalive successfully launched its Wireless phone services in December 2009, in Toronto, and Calgary. Launching Edmonton and Ottawa soon after followed by Vancouver in June 2010.
On February 4, 2011, the Federal Court reversed the decision by Industry Minister Tony Clement, stating that Globalive is not controlled by Canadians. They were given a 45 day stay in which to file an appeal. On May 18, the Federal Court of Appeal heard arguments from Globalive and the federal government as to why the Federal Court decision should be quashed. The Federal Court of Appeal's decision allowed Globalive's appeal and restored the Governor in Council's order that Wind met Canadian ownership requirements. On September 19, Public Mobile entered an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

St. Michael's Church (Marblehead, Massachusetts)

St. Michael's Church is an historic Episcopal church at 26 Pleasant Street in Marblehead, Massachusetts. It is New England's oldest Episcopal church building on its original site.
The church building was constructed in 1714, originally as a parish church of the Church of England, and twenty-nine of the original thirty-three donors were sea captains. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts provided the church with its first rector. The original square church was expanded in 1714. During the American Revolutionary War in 1776 a mob of patriots raided the church and removed the British royal coat of arms from the building. Many of St. Michael's members were Loyalists who fled to Canada during the Revolution. The building was renovated in 1833 with gothic windows, new pews and with the altar, pulpit and original reredos at the north end. Stained glass windows by Redding & Baird were installed in the gothic windows in 1888. The windows over the south entrance were added later. The church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. St. Michael's Church is currently part of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts.

Gerard van der Linden

Gerard van der Linden (born December 29, 1981 in Rotterdam) is a rower from the Netherlands.
Van der Linden started rowing in 1992 and made his international senior debut in the lightweight fours at the 2000 World Championships in Zagreb. Together with Ivo Snijders, Dylan van der Linde and Coen Eggenkamp he finished on the 9th position. With Karel Dormans, Jeroen Spaans and Joeri de Groot he finished third at the 2001 Rowing World Cup meeting in Seville, a fifth place in Munich and sixth at the World Championships in Luzern In 2002 Van der Linden totally focused on the lightweight double sculls together with Ivo Snijders. They became ninth and seventh in the World Cup meetings in Hazewinkel and Luzern before winning the silver medal at the Under-23 World Championships. At the senior World Championships in Seville they became 10th.
Van der Linden, Snijders, Karel Dormans as well as Joeri de Groot started a new adventure in the lightweight double sculls in 2003, finishing second in the Munich World Cup and fourth in Luzern. These pre tournament results earned them a place for the World Championships in Milan where they won the silver medal. Their next aim was to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics and with a seventh place in Poznan, a fourth in Munich and a fifth in Luzern they succeeded and they could pack their bags for Athens. They aimed for a medal at the Olympics, but came just short and had to be satisfied with a fourth place.
He then decided to row in the lightweight single scull in 2005, finishing fifth in Eton, third in Munich and sixth in Luzern, before becoming fifth at the World Championships in Gifu. His 2006 results were almost equal with a fourth place in Munich, a fifth in Luzern and a sixth at the World Championships in Eton. In 2007 he made his comeback in the lightweight fours boat with Wolter Blankert, Arnoud Greidanus and Ivo Snijders in Linz where they finished in fourth position. With Roeland Lievens and Paul Drewes as replacements of Blankert and Greidanus they improved their result to a third place in Luzern and they created some high expectations for the World Championships in Munich. They could not keep up with the expectations and only finished in a tenth position in Germany.
For the 2008 season he rowed with Greidanus, Snijders and Marshall Godschalk to an eight place at the World Cup in Munich. After they finished ninth in Luzern Greidanus was replaced by Paul Drewes and in Poznan they rowed to a fifth place, which meant qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

<doc id="18760719" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18760719" title="Piano Sonata (Barraqué)">
Piano Sonata (Barraqué)

The Piano Sonata by Jean Barraqué is a significant serial composition from the period of avant-garde composition in France shortly after World War II.
Composed between 1950 and 1952, it is a large piece, lasting around fifty minutes, in a single movement divided into two connected sections, roughly equal in length. The densely dissonant polyphonic texture of the work resembles the Second Piano Sonata of Pierre Boulez, a work Barraqué knew well. In performance, however, the overall impact is quite different from anything of Boulez, and has often been claimed (e.g. by Hodeir (1961)), to be akin in spirit to the late sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven.
Paul Griffiths has written of the music of the sonata: 'contrasts of themes or keys are replaced by other polarities, in particular between perceptions of notes as sounds (acontextual, as if heard alone) and as tones (part of the unfolding of a serial form), between freedom and fixity in the registral placing of notes, between pulsed and pulseless rhythm and between sound and silence. In his preface to the composition Barraqué drew attention to another opposition, between a "free style" of motifs and chords in easy flow and a "strict style" of intensive, quasi-automatic process acknowledging the total serialism of the time. Compulsion, embodied in the strict music, may seem to spur protest in the free passages. But protest is compromised by having to be voiced in the same language, based on the same series.' Herbert Henck has also noted: 'The overall structure was based on juxtaposing a fast movement with a slow one of equal weight. But as the fast movement built up, slow sections were increasingly introduced, and the slow movement contained some fast ones, so that there was a balance of contrasts within the work as a whole. The piece closed in unision in a mediating tempo with a twelve-tone row, whose basic form determined the pitch structure of the whole work.'
The sonata was recorded commercially by Yvonne Loriod between 28 and 30 October 1957 and issued in 1958, but it was not given its first performance in public until 24 April 1967, when the Danish pianist Elisabeth Klein played it in a recital in Copenhagen, seemingly unaware that she was in fact giving the world première. It was subsequently recorded commercially by Claude Helffer in 1969, Roger Woodward in 1972, Stefan Litwin in 1997, Herbert Henck in 1999, and Jean-Frédéric Neuburger in 2011. The Sonata had been published by Aldo Bruzzichelli, Florence in 1966; the rights have since transferred to Bärenreiter-Verlag of Kassel. The original edition is rife with notational errors, and performers (e.g. Henck) had to prepare their own edition.

History.
The gatehouse was originally a two-story rough stone farm house built by Richard Whittier between August and November 1830. In April 1882, it was purchased by Charles H. Tenney. It was redesigned in 1883 by architect C. Willis Damon into a gatehouse for the Tenney estate known as Grey Court.
When first built, it was a two story stone structure with five bays on its front facade and a central entry. The modifications by Damon gave the building a distinctive Queen Anne Victorian character, changing the roof to be hipped, and adding an ornately decorated tower with weathervane on one corner. A porch was added to shelter the entry, whose gable has rows of decorative shingles.
In 1951, the Tenney family gave to the town for Tenney High School (now Tenney Grammar School) and sold the rest to the Basilian Salvatorian Order. From 1977-1978 a series of fires eventually destroyed the mansion. The Gatehouse and the Stock House or Stables are all that remain standing; the estate has since been converted to a state park.
The gatehouse is currently home to the Methuen Historical Society.

The Capt. John Thorndike House is a historic First Period house at 184 Hale Street in Beverly, Massachusetts. It is a 2.5 story wood frame house with a central chimney and a raised leanto section in back. The house, like many First Period houses, was built in several stages. The oldest part, the chimney and the right side, was built as a two story section with leanto, likely in 1702 (based on the date being carved on one of the framing posts). This particular type of original sections is rare among First Period houses. Later in the first period the left side of the house was built, but without a leanto section. The left side leanto was added later in the 18th century, and part of the leanto section was raised by a shed dormer in the 19th century.
The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

Sometime before the end of the First Period (c. 1720s) a shed-style leanto addition was added to its rear (the side now facing the street), giving it a saltbox appearance. The house was moved to its present location in 1917, oriented to provide views of the coast. At this time a new chimney was provided, and a large dormer was added to the rear to expand the upstairs living space.
