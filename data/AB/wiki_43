Birks Group

Birks Group (formerly Birks & Mayors) is a designer, manufacturer and retailer of jewellery, timepieces, silverware and gifts, with stores and manufacturing facilities located in Canada and the United States. It operates stores under three different retail banners: 31 "Maison Birks" stores across Canada (formerly "Birks"), 20 "Mayors" stores in Florida and Georgia, and 2 "Brinkhaus" stores in Vancouver and Calgary. The company also operates one Rolex-branded store in Orlando. The company is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, with American corporate offices located in Tamarac, Florida. 
Birks Group was created in November 2005 through the merger of the Henry Birks and Sons Ltd. chain in Canada and the Mayors Jewelers Inc. chain in the United States.
History.
Birks Group traces its origins to the opening by Henry Birks of a small jewellery shop in Montreal in 1879.
Henry Birks and Sons.
With an investment of CAD$3,000, in 1879 Henry Birks opened a small jewellery shop on St. James Street in the heart of Montreal's financial and commercial district. In 1893, Birks went into partnership with his three sons (William, John and Gerald), and the name of the firm became "Henry Birks and Sons". As the focus of Montreal's commercial centre moved northward towards Saint Catherine Street, the Birks store moved to new premises on Phillips Square in 1894, where the company still maintains a store and corporate offices. 
Commencing in 1901, Birks oversaw the expansion of the company across Canada, with stores opening in the country's largest cities. In some cases, it bought local jewellers, adding its name to the local one. For instance the Birks store in Toronto was Birks-Ryrie and the one in Winnipeg was Birks-Dingwall. In 1955, the company successfully sued the City of Montreal before the Supreme Court of Canada for forcing it to close on Catholic holidays, in "Henry Birks & Sons (Montreal) Ltd. v. the City of Montreal".
In 2007, Birks was named as the Official Supplier of Jewellery for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
Mayors.
The Mayors chain was founded in 1910 in Ohio.
Flagship stores.
Maison Birks has six flagship stores in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver. Mayors’ flagships are PGA Commons and Town Center at Boca Raton in Palm Beach County, The Galleria at Fort Lauderdale, Dadeland Mall in Kendall and Buckhead in Atlanta.

Pixel artist

A pixel artist is a graphic designer who specializes in computer art and can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation. Similar to chromoluminarism used in the pointillism style of painting, in which small distinct points of primary colors create the impression of a wide selection of secondary and intermediate colors, a pixel artist works with pixels, the smallest piece of information in an image. The technique relies on the perceptive ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to mix the color spots into a fuller range of tones. Pixel art is often utilitarian and anonymous. Pixel design can refer to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.
Common uses of pixel design include print and broadcast media, web design and games. For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of design especially when utilizing pre-existing materials or using diverse elements. Pixel artists can also be a specialist in computer animation such as Computer Animation Production System users in post production of animated films and rendering (computer graphics) images like raster graphics.
In the 2000s, pixel artists such as Tyler West, Stephane Martiniere and Daniel Dociu have gained international notoriety and artistic recognition, due in part to the popularity of computer and video games. For instance the E3 Media and Business Summit, an annual trade show for the computer and video games industry, has a concurrent juried art show, "Into the Pixel" starting in 2003. Jurist and Getty Research Institute curator Louis Marchesano noted that most of the works were concept pieces used in the development of games.
Pixel artists are also used in digital forensics, an emerging field, to both create and detect fraud in all forms of media including "the courts, politics and scientific journals". For instance, the Federal Office of Research Integrity has said that the percent of allegations of fraud they investigated involved contested images has risen from less than 3 in 1990 to 44.1 percent in 2006.
History.
Computer art started in 1960s and by its nature is evolutionary since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible. The term "pixel art" was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982. Adobe Systems, founded in 1982, developed the Postscript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular. Adobe Illustrator, a vector drawing program based on the Bezier curve, was introduced in 1987 and Adobe Photoshop followed in 1990. Adobe Flash, a popular set of multimedia software used to add animation and interactivity to web pages, was introduced in 1996.
In the 2000s, pixel artists have been employed increasingly in video games and, to a lesser extent in music videos. These artists have remained somewhat underground until the mid-2000s. In 2006 Röyksopp released "Remind Me", illustrated completely by pixel art, which the New York Times cited as amazing and hypnotic. (See video here [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Royksopp+-+%22Remind+Me%22&search_type=&aq=f].)
Background.
A pixel artist is one of the new media artists that employs technology while also utilizing traditional media and art forms. They may have a fine arts background such as photography, painting or drawing but self-taught designers and artists are also able to accomplish this work. They are often required to employ imaging and a full range of artistic and technological skills including those of conceptual artists.
In digital imaging, a pixel ("pict"ure "el"ement) is the smallest piece of information in an image. 
The word "pixel" is based on a contraction of "pix" (for "pictures") and "el" (for "element"); similar formations with "el" for "element" include voxel, luxel, and texel. Pixels are normally arranged in a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots, squares, or rectangles. Each pixel is a sample of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The intensity of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three or four components such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
Neuroplasticity is a key element of observing a many pixel images. While two individuals will observe the same photons reflecting off a photorealistic image and hitting their retinas, someone whose mind has been primed with the theory of pointillism may "see" a very different image as the image is interpreted in the visual cortex.
Techniques.
The total number of pixels ("image resolution"), and the amount of information in each pixel (often called "color depth") determine the quality of an image. For example, an image that stores 24 bits of color-information per pixel (the standard for computer displays since around 1995) can represent smoother degrees of shading than one that only stores 16 bits per pixel, but not as smooth as one that stores 48 bits. Likewise, an image sampled at 640 x 480 pixels (and therefore containing 307,200 pixels) will look rough and blocky compared to one sampled at 1280 x 1024 (1,310,720 pixels). Because it takes a large amount of data to store a high-quality image, computer software often uses data compression techniques to reduce this size for images stored on disk. Some techniques sacrifice information, and therefore image quality, in order to achieve a smaller file-size. Computer scientists refer to compression techniques that lose information as lossy compression.
Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 pixels per inch (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 dots per inch (DPI) or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor. Typically, a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process (CMYK) printing.
Drawings usually start with what is called the line art, which is the basic line that defines the item the artist intends to create. Line arts can be either traced over scanned drawings or hand drawn on the computer itself by the use of a mouse or a graphics tablet and are often shared among other pixel artists in diverse websites in order to receive some feedback. Other techniques, some resembling painting, also exist, such as knowledge of the color theory. The limited palette often implemented into pixel art usually promotes the use of dithering in order to achieve different shades and colors (when necessary); hand-made anti-aliasing is also used for smoother purposes. A pixel artist will exponentially increase the zoom of whatever they are working on to make adjustments as needed and then view the results until desired changes are achieved.

J. P. Small Memorial Stadium

J. P. Small Memorial Stadium is a baseball park in Jacksonville, Florida. It is located in the Durkeeville community in northwest Jacksonville. Constructed in 1912 and rebuilt in 1936, it was the city's first municipal recreation field, and served as its primary baseball park before the construction of Wolfson Park in 1954. Throughout the years the stadium has been known at various times as Barrs Field, Durkee Field, and the Myrtle Avenue Ball Park.
History.
Barrs Field era.
The original facility was constructed in 1911–1912 on a patch of land owned by Joseph H. Durkee, a former Union officer during the American Civil War who had settled in Jacksonville, where he became a prominent businessman and politician. In 1911, Durkee's son Jay Durkee turned control of the property over to Amander Barrs, a local businessman and President of the Jacksonville Baseball Association. Barrs ordered the construction of a recreational field to be used by local teams on the property. The facility was completed in 1912 and was known as Barrs Field, but was generally known as the Myrtle Avenue Ball Park to locals. One early tenant was the Jacksonville Athletics, an African-American club for which James Weldon Johnson played. One of the rare professional clubs was the Jacksonville Scouts of the Florida State League, who played in 1921. However, as the city had no municipal park, other teams used fields at the Jacksonville Fairgrounds or across the river in South Jacksonville during this time.
In addition to local teams, Major League clubs including the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers held their spring training at the field. The Philadelphia Athletics were the first major league team to use Barrs Field for spring training, from 1914 until 1918. In 1918, the Pittsburgh Pirates held their spring training at the ballpark. From 1919 until 1920, the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers called Barrs Field their spring training home. The Dodgers would return for one last spring at Barrs in 1922.
Durkee Field era.
The lack of a city park led both major and minor league teams to avoid Jacksonville after 1922. In 1926, the city government decided to purchase Barrs Field from Durkee in hopes of bringing back professional baseball. On March 13, 1926, the city signed a binder to purchase the park, which was renamed Durkee Field. Shortly after this, the city entered into negotiations to bring a Southeastern League franchise to the city. This was successful, and the original incarnation of the Jacksonville Tars was born.
In 1932, the city purchased Durkee Field for $348,000. The original stadium was destroyed in a fire in 1936, but the city immediately rebuilt it in 1936-1937. The new structure was larger, and included a section for African-American patrons in the era of segregation. In 1938 and from 1941 to mid-1942, Jacksonville's only Negro league franchise, the Jacksonville Red Caps of the Negro American League, used the park as their home field.
The Jersey City Giants held spring training at the ballpark in 1946. In that year, the Giants were scheduled to play against a Montreal Royals team that included Jackie Robinson and John Wright, who were in the process of integrating organized baseball. The Giants-Royals game was scheduled for On March 24, 1946 at Durkee Field; however, the Jacksonville Playground and Recreation Board prohibited "white and Negro athletes" from playing together in their facilities, and pledged to bar Robinson and Wright from the park. The Royals, with support from the Dodgers, refused to leave Robinson and Wright at Montreal's training camp in Daytona Beach, and canceled the game.
In 1953, Jacksonville businessman Samuel W. Wolfson purchased the Jacksonville Tars franchise and reorganized the team as the Jacksonville Braves, a Class A affiliate of the Milwaukee Braves Major League Baseball club. Among the major changes Wolfson introduced to the team was racial integration. Three black players from the Braves farm system – Hank Aaron, Félix Mantilla, and Horace Garner – came to Jacksonville, making the Braves one of the first integrated teams in the South Atlantic League and in the state of Florida. In the following year, the city started construction on the stadium later known as Wolfson Park, and the Braves moved out upon its completion.
Later use and renovation.
After its replacement as the municipal ballpark, Durkee Field continued to be used by local high schools and colleges, including Edward Waters College, Raines High School, and Stanton High School. However, by the late 1970s the stadium was in disrepair and was scheduled for demolition. Local advocates pushed to save the park, and in 1980 Jacksonville City Council member Sallye B. Mathis sponsored legislation to renovate it and rename it for J. P. Small, who had served as a teacher, coach, and athletic director of Stanton High from 1934 to 1969. Renovations included structural repairs, a new roof, press box and dugouts, paving the parking lot, a new playscape, and lighted fields. Councilwoman Denise Lee and Mayor Jake Godbold hosted a rededication ceremony of the park.
Following demolition of Wolfson Park in 2002, J. P. Small Ballpark became the last historic park in the city of Jacksonville. In May 2003 the Jacksonville City Government pushed forward legislation that would give J. P. Small Ballpark a permanent historical marker. Further renovation in 2006 included a small museum. In July 2013, the park was added to the National Register of Historic Places under the name Joseph E. Durkee Athletic Field.

Carl Angelo "Tuffy" DeLuna (April 30, 1927 – July 21, 2008) was an organized crime figure who was once the powerful underboss of the Kansas City crime family (the family). He was also brother-in-law to Kansas City crime boss Anthony Civella.
Born in Brooklyn, New York, DeLuna rose through the ranks of the family to eventually become underboss and second-in-commad to Nicholas Civella. He was said to be personally responsible for the ambush of a rival mob crew, the Spero brothers, at the Virginia Tavern in Kansas City, Missouri in 1978.
A well-respected and trusted mobster, DeLuna maintained the family’s close ties with the Chicago Outfit, the Frank Balistrieri family in Milwaukee, and the Cleveland family during the mob infiltration of several Las Vegas casinos in the mid-1970s. 
Artie Piscano (portrayed by Vinny Vella) in the film "Casino" was based in large part on Carl DeLuna. In the film, Piscano dies of a heart attack during a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raid on his home. In reality, DeLuna's home was raided on February 14, 1979 and it was found that he kept extensive cryptic notes hidden in his basement which, together with wiretaps, connected all the dots the FBI needed in linking the mob to illegal control of Las Vegas casinos. DeLuna, though, was arrested, tried and sentenced to 30 years. 
DeLuna was released from prison in 1998 and died in Kansas City in 2008.

Derwent Power Station

Derwent Power Station is a 214MWe gas-fired power station on Holme Lane near Spondon in Derby, England. It is built on the site of the former Spondon Power Station
History.
The current Derwent power station was built on the site of the former Spondon power stations. Spondon A was built in the 1920s by British Celanese. It was sold to the Nottingham & Derby Power Company in 1929. It was then nationalised before eventually being sold to Courtaulds. Spondon A eventually closed in the early 1980s.
In 1959, the Spondon H process steam station opened alongside Spondon A. Spondon H had a capacity of 30 MW using three 10 MW sets, and was unique among the CEGBs power stations as it was designed primarily to produce steam to supply the British Celanese plant. The station had two single-flue concrete chimneys of c.'315 in height, one being demolished in the early 1990s the other in the early 2000s. The station also had four concrete cooling towers of c.'150 in height located c.0.25 miles to the east, these were in practice rarely used. They were demolished in 1984.
Derwent power station was originally built for Courtaulds Chemicals and was opened on June 1, 1995 by Tim Eggar, the Energy Secretary. It was owned 17.5% by Courtaulds, 33% by Mission Energy Company (UK) Ltd, and 49.5% by Southern Electric Power Generation (now owned by Scottish and Southern Energy). The nearby works are now owned by Accordis. The 33% stake of Mission Energy was sold to International Power. The other stakes are now owned by Mitsui. Near to the plant is Celanese Acetates Ltd, which used to be British Celanese, which does not have any ownership of the power station. The textiles site was built in 1916 to provide waterproofing for aircraft wings, known as British Cellulose & Chemical Manufacturing and made cellulose acetate and Acetic anhydride. This came from techniques invented by the Swiss chemist, Henri Dreyfus. British Celanese and Courtaulds merged in 1957. Courtaulds was bought by Sara Lee in 2000 following a hostile takeover. The station currently trades as Derwent Cogeneration Ltd.
Specification.
It is a combined cycle power station that runs on natural gas. Most of the power is used for the works next to the power station. Only around 50MWe is put into the National Grid; and the heat produces steam for the textile plant. This produces electricity for around 180,000 homes; enough for Derby and beyond. It has four General Electric Frame 6 MS6001B gas turbine and a 59MWe steam turbine and surface condenser. It is a combined heat and power (CHP) plant.
Latest information is that this Combined Heat and Power plant (CHP) plant is to stop supplying steam to the adjacent textile plant from 2011, the steam supply is to be provided by a new gas fired CHP plant to be built by the textile firm on land it owns adjacent to the existing Derwent Power Station.ref article in the local press

Graham Lake (Maine)

Graham Lake in Hancock County, Maine is a eutrophic reservoir formed by the construction of a hydro-electric power dam in 1922 four miles (6 km) upstream from Ellsworth, Maine. The first dam was a hastily built earthen dam built by the Bangor Hydro Electric Company. It failed in 1923, flooding downtown Ellsworth and doing almost $8 million in property damage. The dam was rebuilt and operated by Bangor Hydro until its sale in 1999. The dam has since been acquired by Pennsylvania Power & Light which continues to use it to generate electricity.
Water clarity in the lake is low, with secchi disk measurements averaging less than 3 meters. Fish in the lake that are of interest to anglers include smallmouth bass, white perch, chain pickerel, landlocked salmon, and brook trout.

Colossal carbon tube

Colossal carbon tubes (CCTs) are a tubular form of carbon. In contrast to the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), colossal carbon tubes have much larger diameters ranging between 40 and 100 μm. Their walls have a corrugated structure with abundant pores, as in corrugated fiberboard, where the solid membranes have a graphite-like layered structure. 
CCTs have technologically attractive properties such as ultralight weight, extremely high strength, excellent ductility and high conductivity - which make them possibly suitable for clothing. They are excellent conductors, are 15 times stronger than the strongest carbon fiber (T1000), have 30 times the tenacity of Kevlar and are 224 times stronger than individual cotton fibers. The tubes exhibit an ultra low density comparable to that of carbon nanofoams.
CCTs have a tensile strength of 7 GPa, and a high specific strength (tensile strength per density), and a breaking length of 6.0 km. It exceeds the specific strength of the strongest carbon nanotube. This strength is sufficient to support a space elevator if retained in a fabricated macroscale structure.
CCTs conduct electricity and show some of the properties of semiconductors.

Bergen County Court House

Bergen County, New Jersey had a series of court houses. The current one stands in Hackensack, New Jersey.
History.
The current Bergen County Courthouse is not the first courthouse but actually the sixth courthouse built for Bergen County. In 1683 four counties were created in East Jersey and they were Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth. In 1710 Hackensack became the county seat in Bergen. In 1715 the first courthouse was built and it was located three blocks from the current courthouse. The courthouse also housed a jail. The second courthouse was built in 1734 near the “Green”, but was burned by the British in 1780 during the Revolutionary War. The third courthouse, a log building, was then built in Oakland. This was considered a temporary location and the courthouse later moved to the home of John Hopper in Ho-Ho-Kus. After the war, the courthouse was moved to the house of Archibald Campbell of Hackensack.
Freeholder Peter Zabriskie later donated land near his Hackensack home located at the northeast corner of Main and Bridge Streets and in 1786 a new courthouse and jail opened. Peter Zabriskie’s home, called “The Mansion” was also called “Washington’s Headquarters” because George Washington frequently was a guest there. Years later the Mansion became a hotel. The Mansion was then torn down in 1945. In 1822 due to space limitations, a new courthouse was built at the location of the current courthouse and it was utilized for over 90 years. 
The current courthouse is the sixth Bergen County courthouse. James Riely Gordon, a civil engineer, born in Winchester, Virginia, won a competition to design the Bergen County courthouse. The style of the courthouse building is known as American Renaissance. Construction began in 1910 and was completed in 1912 at a cost of one million dollars. The jail was also completed in 1912 and the style of the jail is medieval revival. The courthouse was placed on the New Jersey and National Registers of historic places in 1982 and 1983. 
The Green is a public square located across the street from the courthouse at the corner of Main Street and Court Street. On the west side of the green is a marker showing where the second courthouse stood before it was burned by the British in 1780. A bronze statue is located at the intersection of Court Street and Washington Place. This statue is of General Enoch Poor. General Poor, a New Hampshire native, was a hero at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. General Poor served under General Washington. He was in New Jersey organizing an army to raid New York City. General Poor died in 1780 and is buried across the street from the Green at the Dutch Reformed Church. General Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette attended General Poor’s funeral.
Construction.
The interior dome of the rotunda area of the courthouse is modeled after the Pantheon in Rome. On the first floor of the rotunda building there was a fountain. The fountain was removed in 1930. In the 1930s as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), murals were painted in courtrooms 253 and 352. In the early 1940s an additional mural was added in courtroom 357. All three murals were designed by Teaneck resident William Winter. The murals in room 352 (formerly known as the Supreme Court Room) represent the roots of American Law. The murals in room 253 (formerly known as the Freeholder Chambers) represent local historical sights. The murals in room 357 (formerly known as the Circuit Court Chamber) represent Roman Law. There are four stained glass skylights in the rotunda building. The first is located in the rotunda dome and it measures eight feet in diameter. Eight trapezoidal sections carry the name of a historically significant English or American jurist. The three remaining skylights contain the Bergen County seal. The glass utilized for these skylights was made by M.J. Lamb. The interior of the rotunda and its courtrooms were treated with marble, scagliola, bronze and cast iron.
The exterior walls of the courthouse rotunda building were made from Vermont marble. On top of the dome is a copper figure entitled “Enlightenment Giving Power” by Johannes Gelert. Around the drum of the dome is a relief consisting of forty panels that represent twelve tablets of the first Roman Law. Five bronze eagles adorn the balustrades on the corners of the building. The eagles and “Enlightenment” were resurfaced with gold leaf in 1994. There are four sculptures on the front of the rotunda building that faces Court Street. Two of the sculptures each contain three figures. The left group consists of Truth holding a mirror flanked by Justice and Integrity. The right group consists of Honor flanked by Law and Order. There are two statues located on the walls of the main steps. The left statue represents History and the right statue represents Law. 
Construction for the Administration Building started in 1929 and was completed in 1933. The style of this building is called neoclassical. The exterior walls of the Administration Building were made from Arkansas limestone. The Annex building that joins the Administration Building with the rotunda building was completed in 1958.
In popular culture.
The historical charm of the courthouse has even caught the eye of Hollywood. Scenes from the following television shows and movies feature the courthouse:

Marianne Grunthal

Marianne Grunthal (31 January 1896 - 2 May 1945, Schwerin) was a German teacher who was executed under the Nazi Regime for expressing her wish for peace.
Grunthal was born in Zehdenick, Province of Brandenburg. In 1945, after having heard the news of Hitler's death, she had called out aloud with relief: "Gott sei Dank, dann ist der furchtbare Krieg endlich zu Ende" (English: "Thank god, then this terrible war will be over at last", different version: "Thank God, then there will be peace").
Marianne Grunthal's call had been heard by SS guards who were on their way to bring prisoners from concentration camps Ravensbrück and Sachsenhausen on so-called death marches towards the west. For having spoken this single sentence, Marianne Grunthal was hanged by SS-men on 2 May 1945 on the central station square in Schwerin - only hours before American troops had entered the city. 
Today the station square in Schwerin is named after Marianne Grunthal, also a Street in Zehdenick is named after her. The lamp post on which Marianne Grunthal was hanged is still standing today, bearing a memorial plaque.
Her Grave is situated on the Nordfriedhof (Northern cemetery) in the City of Zehdenick (State of Brandenburg)

The Dowelmax is a loose tenon dowelling jig manufactured by the O.M.S. Tool company in Canada.

Quechers

The QuEChERS method is a streamlined approach that makes it easier and less expensive for analytical chemists to examine pesticide residues in food. The name is a portmanteau word formed from "Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe".
Applications.
The QuEChERS method has been readily accepted by many pesticide residue analysts. Some modifications to the original QuEChERS method had to be introduced to ensure efficient extraction of pH dependent compounds (e.g. phenoxyalcanoic acids), to minimize degradation of susceptible compounds (e.g. base and acid labile pesticides) and to expand the spectrum of matrices covered. 
The analyst homogenizes the sample (fruits, vegetables, tobacco, etc.) in a blender; puts it in a centrifuge tube with a reagent and agitates for one minute. The reagents used depend on the type of sample to be analysed. Following this the sample is put through a cleanup column prior to analysis by Gas-liquid chromatography.
Samples prepared using the QuEChERS method can be processed more quickly using a homogenization instrument. Such instruments can homogenize the food sample in a centrifuge tube, then agitate the sample with the reagent of choice, before moving the extracted sample for centrifuging. By using such an instrument, the samples can moved through the QuEChERS method more quickly.

Beautiful, Dirty, Rich

"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" is a song performed by American recording artist Lady Gaga from her debut studio album, "The Fame". It was released as a promotional single from the album on September 16, 2008. It is an uptempo dance-pop song that makes heavy use of synthesizers, and is lyrically about Gaga's experiences as a struggling artist in the Lower East Side. She wrote the song while she was, as she says, "doing a lot of drugs" and "trying to figure things out."
The song was met with critical acclaim, with reviewers complimenting the lyrics and the fun nature of the song. It also achieved minor commercial success, peaking at number eighty-three on the UK Singles Chart. Two versions were released of the song's accompanying music video - one was intercut with clips of the ABC television series, "Dirty Sexy Money" serving as a promotion for the show, and the other was the full-length video. Both versions feature Gaga and company dancing around in various locations of a mansion, and burning money.
Gaga has performed the song live several times, including on her first headlining The Fame Ball Tour, where she performed the song while wearing a futuristic bustier with silver triangular panels. The performance was praised by critics for Gaga's "strong" vocals and her energy, and also for giving the show a strong beginning.
Background.
Gaga said the song "was just me trying to figure things out," and she later stated that she "was doing a lot of drugs" when she wrote the song. She claims it is about how "whoever you are or where you live – you can self-proclaim this inner fame based on your personal style, and your opinions about art and the world, despite being conscious of it," and also about her experiences as a struggling artist working in the Lower East Side. The line "Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah," according to Gaga, was inspired by "rich kids" in the area who she would hear calling their parents for money to buy drugs with. She added that "ultimately what I want people to take from it is 'Bang-bang.' No matter who you are and where you come from, you can feel beautiful and dirty rich."
Composition.
"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" is an uptempo dance-pop song which is more synth-heavy compared to the mostly electronic songs on "The Fame". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song has a moderate electro-dance-pop groove and it is composed in the key of B minor with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song is set in common time, and Gaga's vocal range spans from A3 to D5. It has a basic sequence of Bm–D5–A–Bm–D5–A as its chord progression. During recording of the song, Gaga was reluctant to add any dance-oriented beats to the song, and insisted on keeping its original rock version. However, music producer Rob Fusari convinced her that a drum machine would not hurt her integrity, telling her that Queen, who was one of Gaga's musical inspirations, used it in their music. Fusari commented, "I think that's what finally got her to give it a shot, [...] We finished ‘Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' that day. It's one of the songs on her debut album."
Critical reception.
"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" received general acclaim from critics. Matthew Chisling of Allmusic used the song and "Paparazzi" as examples of how "The Fame"'s lyrics "salt and pepper the album with a nasty, club-friendly feeling of fun and feistiness that an excellent, well-produced dance album should have." Genevieve Koski of "The A.V. Club" called "LoveGame" and this song "propulsive club anthems" that "chug along on wave after wave of synths and programmed drums, resulting in a dizzying sonic trip that approximates the high point of a chemically enhanced night of club-hopping." Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that Gaga "successfully out dirties" on the song.
Chart performance.
The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number eighty-nine due to strong digital downloads, on the issue dated February 21, 2009. On its second week, it rose to the eighty-third position which is where it peaked, and the next week it dropped to number eighty-seven, which was its final appearance on the chart. According to Nielsen Soundscan, the song has sold 275,000 digital downloads in the United States.
Music video.
A music video was filmed for the song and directed by Melina Matsoukas. There are two versions of the video - one intercut with clips from the ABC series "Dirty Sexy Money" and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making her way down a hallway with several people who are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing dollar bills around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing it into her mouth. Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.
Live performances.
Gaga has performed "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" live at the AOL Sessions, where she also performed "Just Dance," an acoustic version of "Poker Face," "Paparazzi," and "LoveGame." She also performed it at the MTV UK Live Sessions, also singing "Just Dance," "LoveGame," and "Poker Face." She most notably performed the song on her first headlining The Fame Ball Tour. On the tour, it was preceded by the song "Paparazzi," which ended with clicking cameras and a brief medley of "Starstruck" and "LoveGame." The performance of "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" followed, with Gaga frolicking with her dancers and wearing an "austere" blonde bob wig and a "sculptural bustier with futuristic triangular silver panels, and exaggerated peplum," which was one of her six costumes over the course of the show. The song was the end of the first of four parts of the show, and was followed by a video clip, "The Brain," which featured Gaga as her alter ego, Candy Warhol, brushing her hair.
The performance of the song, along with the rest of the first quarter of the show, was praised by Jim Harrington of "Mercury News" for giving the show a strong beginning, and Gaga's vocal performance was also complimented. Mikael Wood of "Rolling Stone" was rather critical of the performance; Wood claimed that it grew tiresome quickly but praised Gaga for her energy. Whitney Pastorek of "Entertainment Weekly" praised Gaga's "strong" singing voice, adding, "The girl can, and does, sing."

Energy law

Energy laws govern the use and taxation of energy, both renewable and non-renewable. These laws are the primary authorities (such as caselaw, statutes, rules, regulations and edicts) related to energy. In contrast, energy policy refers to the policy and politics of energy.
Energy law includes the legal provision for oil, gasoline, and "extraction taxes." The practice of energy law includes contracts for siting, extraction, licenses for the acquisition and ownership rights in oil and gas both under the soil before discovery and after its capture, and adjudication regarding those rights.
International law.
There is a growing academic interest in international energy law, including continuing legal education seminars, treatises, law reviews, and graduate courses.
Africa.
Nigeria's government owns the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
Uganda has adopted a new nuclear power law, which it hopes "will boost technical cooperation between the country and the International Atomic Energy Agency," according to "a senior agency official" from that African country.
Australia.
Energy is big business in Australia. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association represents 98% of the oil and gas producers in Australia.
Canada.
Canada has an extensive energy law, both through the federation and the provinces, especially Alberta. These include:
There is some academic interest in the energy law of Canada, with looseleaf periodical services, monographs, and consultation with lawyers specializing in that practice, available.
The Supreme Court of Canada has had issued some Canadian energy case law.
Canada's energy laws are so extensive and complicated in large part because of its government-owned energy resources:
Canada and the Quebec province also own extensive hydroelectric dam facilities, which have generated not only power but controversy.
European Union.
European energy law has been focused on the legal mechanisms for managing short-term disruptions to the continent's energy supply, such as Germany's 1974 Law to Secure the Energy Supply. The European integrated hydrogen project was a European Union project to integrate United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) guidelines and create a basis of ECE regulation of hydrogen vehicles and the necessary infrastructure replacing national legislation and regulations. The aim of this project was enhancing of the safety of hydrogen vehicles and harmonizing their licensing and approval process.
Five nations have created the EurObserv'ER energy consortium.
Germany.
Germany's Renewable Energy Law mandates the use of renewable energy through its taxes and tariffs. It promotes the development of renewable energy sources via a system of feed-in tariffs. It regulates the amount of energy generated by the producer and the type of renwable energy source. It also creates an incentive to encourage technological advancements and costs.
The German government has proposed abandoning "its planned phase-out of nuclear energy to help rein in surging electricity prices and protect the environment, according to proposals drawn up by
an energy taskforce under Economy Minister Michael Glos." The German Green Party has opposed nuclear energy, as well as the market power of German utilities, claiming the "energy shortfall" has been artificially created.
There is significant academic interest in German energy law.
Italy.
Italy has few natural resources. lacking substantial deposits of iron, coal, or oil. Proven natural gas reserves, mainly in the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic, constitute the country's most important mineral resource. More than 80% of the country's energy sources are imported. The energy sector is highly dependent on imports from abroad: in 2006 the country imported more than 86% of its total energy consumption.
In the last decade, Italy has became one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy, ranking as the world's fifth largest solar energy producer in 2009 and the sixth largest producer of wind power in 2008.
In 1987, after the Chernobyl disaster, a large majority of Italians passed a referendum opting for phasing out nuclear power. The government responded by closing existing nuclear power plants and completely putting a halt to the national nuclear program. Italy also imports about 16% of its electricity need from France for 6.5 GWe, which makes it the world's biggest importer of electricity. Due to its reliance on expensive fossil fuels and imports, Italians pay approximately 45% more than the EU average for electricity.
In 2004, a new Energy Law brought the possibility of joint ventures with foreign companies to build nuclear power plants and import electricity. In 2005, Italy's power company, ENEL made an agreement with Electricite de France for 200 MWe from a nuclear reactor in France and potentially an additional 1,000 MWe from new construction. As part of the agreement, ENEL received a 12.5% stake in the project and direct involvement in design, construction, and operation of the plants. In another move, ENEL also bought 66% of the Slovak Electric utility that operates six nuclear reactors. As part of this agreement, ENEL will pay the Slovak government EUR 1.6 billion to complete a nuclear power plant in Mochovce, which has a gross output of 942 MWe. With these agreements, Italy has managed to access nuclear power without placing reactors on Italian territory.
Lithuania.
The nation of Lithuania has an energy law, Energetikos teisė.
Other European countries.
Albania has an oil and gas institute.
There is significant geothermal power in Iceland; about 80% of the nation's energy needs are met by geothermal sources.
Iraq.
Technically, Iraq has no energy law, but proposed legislation has been pending for almost five years as of early 2012.
Japan.
Prior to the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011, and the nuclear disasters that resulted from it, Japan generated 30% of its electrical power from nuclear reactors and planned to increase that share to 40%.
Nuclear energy was a national strategic priority in Japan, but there had been concern about the ability of Japan's nuclear plants to withstand seismic activity. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant was completely shut down for 21 months following an earthquake in 2007.
The 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused the failure of cooling systems at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on March 11 and a nuclear emergency was declared. 140,000 residents were evacuated. The total amount of radioactive material released is unclear, as the crisis is ongoing. On 6 May 2011, Prime Minister Naoto Kan ordered the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant be shut down as an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher is likely to hit the area within the next 30 years.
Problems in stabilizing the Fukushima I nuclear plant had hardened attitudes to nuclear power. As of June 2011, "more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they are anti-nuclear and distrust government information on radiation".
As of October 2011, there have been electricity shortages, but Japan survived the summer without the extensive blackouts that had been predicted. An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation’s reliance on nuclear power.
Many of Japan's nuclear plants have been closed, or their operation has been suspended for safety inspections. The last of Japan's 54 reactors (Tomari-3) went offline for maintenance on May 5, 2012., leaving Japan completely without nuclear-produced electrical power for the first time since 1970. Despite protests, on 1 July 2012 unit 3 of the Ōi Nuclear Power Plant was restarted. As of September 2012, Ōi units 3 and 4 are Japan's only operating nuclear power plants, although the city and prefecture of Osaka have requested they be shut down.
The United States-Japan Joint Nuclear Energy Action Plan is a bilateral agreement aimed at putting in place a framework for the joint research and development of nuclear energy technology, which was signed on April 18, 2007. It is believed that the agreement is the first that the US has signed to develop nuclear power technologies with another country, although Japan has agreements with Australia, Canada, China, France, and the United Kingdom. Under the plan, the United States and Japan would each conduct research into fast reactor technology, fuel cycle technology, advanced computer simulation and modeling, small and medium reactors, safeguards and physical protection; and nuclear waste management, which it to be coordinated by a joint steering committee. The treaty's progress has been in limbo since the Fukushima I nuclear accidents.
The Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) is a government-owned company involved in fossil-fuel energy exploration, amongst other activities. In 2013, its corporate workers first extracted Methane clathrate from seabed deposits.
Malaysia.
Malaysia heavily regulates its energy sector.
From 1982 to 1992, the Government of Sabah owned Sabah Gas Industries for the downstream operations of Sabah natural gas resources, based in Labuan, Malaysia, which was put up for privatization. Its methanol plant was sold to Petronas and operates today as Petronas Methanol (Labuan) Sdn Bhd. The power station was sold to Sabah Electricity.
Philippines.
Philippines law has provisions concerning energy, fossil fuels, and renewable energy. Energy law in the Philippines is important because that nation is one of the fastest growing in Asia, and has over 80 million residents.
The earliest Philippine energy law dates from 1903, during the American Commonwealth, Act No. 667, concerning franchises for utilities, and Act No. 1022, which allowed such to have mortgages. A uniform law in 1929 allowed for new utilities.
The first coal mining law, known as the Coal Land Act, dates to 1917. Oil exploration was allowed in a 1920 law. The Mining Act (1936) has been amended several times by acts and decrees.
The first hydroelectric power law dates from 1933, and have been updated since, including one that created the National Power Corporation, and has been amended several times through 1967. The Renewable Energy Law (2009) encourages the development and use of non-traditional energy sources.
Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia has some laws concerning energy, especially oil and gas law. Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producer in the world and therefore its energy law has great influence over the world's overall energy supply.
Under the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia, all its oil and gas wealth belongs to the government: "All Allah's bestowed wealth, be it under the ground, on the surface or in national territorial waters, in the land or maritime domains under the state's control, are the property of the state as defined by law. The law defines means of exploiting, protecting, and developing such wealth in the interests of the state, its security and economy." Energy taxes are also specifically allowed; Article 20 of the basic law states, "Taxes and fees are to be imposed on a basis of justice and only when the need for them arises. Imposition, amendment, revocation and exemption is only permitted by law."
Two ministries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia share the responsibility of the energy sector: the Ministry of Oil and the Ministry of Water and Electricity. The country's laws have also established other agencies that have some legal powers, but are not strictly regulatory. These include Saudi Aramco, originally a joint venture between the Kingdom and the California-Arabian Standard Oil, but now a wholly owned by the Kingdom, and Saudi Consolidated Electricity Companies (SCECOs).
Turkey.
Turkey's old Petroleum Law was in effect for 70 years until 2013, when it enacted a new Petroleum Law, number 6491. Amongst other provisions, it extends the permissible years for drilling permits, reduces a fee, and eliminates a state monopoly.
United States.
"This section concerns the law of the United States, as well as the states that are the most populous or largest producers of energy."
In the United States, energy is regulated extensively through the United States Department of Energy, as well as state regulatory agencies.
Every state, the Federal government, and the District of Columbia collect some motor vehicle excise taxes. Specifically, these are excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and gasohol. While many states in the western U.S.A. rely to a great deal on severance taxes (taxes on mineral extraction), most states get a relatively small amount of their revenue from such sources.

German submarine U-402

German submarine "U-402" was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" for service during World War II.
She was laid down at the Danziger Werft in the city of the same name on 22 April 1940 as 'werk' 103, launched on 28 December 1940 and was commissioned on 21 May 1941, with "Kapitänleutnant" Freiherr Siegfried von Forstner in command.
The boat commenced her career with the 3rd U-boat Flotilla on 21 May 1941 carrying-out training before moving on to operations on 1 October 1941. "U-402" carried out eight combat patrols, sinking 14 merchantmen and one warship for a total of over 70,000 GRT during the Second World War. She also damaged three other ships. The submarine was a member of 12 wolfpacks.
For his numerous successes, von Forstner received the Knight's Cross.
Operational history.
1st and 2nd patrols.
No ships were sunk during the first patrol which lasted from 26 October to 9 December 1941. "U-402" followed the Norwegian coast from Kiel before heading west towards the Atlantic. The submarine sailed into St. Nazaire in France, after 45 uneventful days.
On her second patrol, "U-402" damaged the 12,000-ton troopship off the Bay of Biscay on 16 January 1942, but the troopship was able to make repairs in the Azores. "U-402" returned to St. Nazaire on 11 February 1942.
3rd and 4th patrols.
For her third sortie, "U-402" headed for the US east coast, sinking a total of three ships, two of which were the 5,300 ton Soviet tanker "Ashkhabad" and her escort, the 1,000-ton converted yacht off Cape Hatteras on 2 May 1942. The U-boat had been unsuccessfully attacked by a US Navy PBY Catalina in mid-Atlantic on 29 April 1942.
The boat returned to the US eastern seaboard for her fourth patrol, but success eluded her. She returned to France, having been depth charged by patrol bombers off Cape Hatteras in mid-July and suffering a battery explosion. "U-402" limped back to France, but this time to La Pallice, on 5 August 1942.
5th and 6th patrols.
It was a different story on her fifth patrol; the boat attacked over 20,000 tons of shipping, including the torpedoing of five ships from convoy SC 107 which involved the sinking of the British 4,753 ton on 2 November 1942 and a sister, "Empire Sunrise", a few hours earlier.
She also had plenty of success when she attacked seven ships from convoy SC 118 on her sixth patrol.
7th and 8th patrols.
Her seventh outing saw her sinking two ships from convoy SC 129. Retribution was swift; one of the escorts, depth charged and damaged the U-boat sufficiently to force her return to La Pallice on 26 May.
Her eighth and final patrol was marked with a paucity of targets and an ever increasing frequency of air attacks; one of which involved a Wellington of 612 Squadron, RAF on 8 September. "U-402" was not hit, but the aircraft sustained enough damage to make a safe return to its base questionable.
Loss.
"U-402" had departed La Pallice on 4 September 1943. On the 13 October she was sunk by a Mark 24 FIDO Torpedo dropped by TBF Avenger aircraft from the escort carrier .

Yearning (band)

"This article is about the band Yearning. For other uses, see Yearning (disambiguation)."
Yearning was an atmospheric doom metal band from Finland. During its career the band released five studio albums and one demo, the latter being released while the band was still called Flegeton.
History.
Yearning was formed in 1994 under the name "Flegeton". The original line-up consisted of Juhani Palomäki on guitars and vocals and Toni Kristian on drums. The band started to write own music and soon Tero Kalliomäki joined the band as a guitarist. Soon after, Flegeton made a 4-track tape titled "Through the Desolate Lands", but it was never widely distributed.
In July 1995, Flegeton, with a new bass player, Mr. Woodland (aka Petri Salo), went into MDM studios to record their demo "The Temple of Sagal". The demo received praise from enthusiasts of melancholy music. It also got the attention of the French record company Holy Records, which Flegeton contracted with for two full-length studio albums.
In February 1996, the band went into Tico-Tico Studios to record some new material. At this point, the band was renamed Yearning, since the band believed that their old name didn't fit their music anymore. They also recorded the song "Autumn Funeral" during these sessions. ”Autumn Funeral” appears on the Holy Records compilation album The Holy Bible.
Between September 16 and September 29, 1996, Yearning recorded their first album, With Tragedies Adorned in Tico-Tico Studios. The album was engineered and produced by Ahti Kortelainen. The album was released on February 28, 1997 and during the following spring the band was busy promoting their newly released album and performing live.
The band went into the same studio again on October 18 and October 19, 1997 to record a cover of the Paradise Lost song "Eternal" which would appear on a Paradise Lost tribute album released by Holy Records. Afterwards, Yearning did their first European tour in December 1997 and January 1998. They toured along with the bands Nightfall and Sup.
In August and September 1998, Yearning entered Tico-Tico studios again to record their second studio album, Plaintive Scenes. It would eventually be released in February 1999. The year 1999 would also mark the departure of three members, guitarist Tero Kalliomäki, bassist Mr. Woodland, and flutist and female vocalist Lady Tiina Ahonen. They left because of personal and musical disagreements. After several big fights, Yearning's line-up now consisted of Juhani Palomäki handling vocal, guitar, bass guitar, and keyboard duties, while Toni Kristian was still on percussion.
The stripped line-up went into Tico Tico Studios in May 2000 to record their third studio album Frore Meadow. Along with the change in line-up, the music changed as well, taking more influence from progressive rock, gothic metal, and classical music. Frore Meadow was released through Holy Records on January 15, 2001. Due to changes in line-up, Yearning had to recruit musicians to play live, ending up with Matti S. on guitar, Jani Loikas on bass, and Jouni Jormanainen (Jouni Huttunen since 2007) on keyboards. The live line-up would remain unchanged for the next 9 years. In 2001 Yearning also toured France with labelmates Gloomy Grim and Misanthrope.
Yearning did not perform actively during 2002 but new material was composed and arranged very carefully during the time of silence. The outcome would result in Yearning's fourth studio album, Evershade. The album was recorded during June 2003 in Astia Studios with Anssi Kippo as a co-producer. Evershade was released at the end of September 2003. Yearning performed live twice after the release of this album, one concert in Helsinki, and another in Riihimäki, the band's hometown. 
With the release of Evershade, the contract with Holy Records came to an end, leaving Yearning without a record company. The band negotiated with several labels, including Holy Records, on upcoming releases, but many of these negotiations were unproductive and none lead to a satisfactory result. During this time Yearning was rather inactive, performing live only occasionally – partially because the band's drummer and other founding member Toni Kristian had developed a serious addiction problem. Still, during this seemingly quiet period, new material was being written and contract negotiations were being held. Eventually, Toni Kristian was replaced with Aki Kuusinen and a one-album contract offer from Holy Records was accepted. 
With a new contract in pocket, Yearning headed into D-studio in Klaukkala, Finland with musical engineer Olli Haaranen (also known as the guitarist for Colosseum) to record their fifth studio album Merging into Landscapes. Recording took place between March 3 and March 23, 2007. The album was mixed by Jarno Hänninen and mastered at Elektra Mastering. Guest musicians on the album included Tiina Sitomaniemi, who sang also on Plaintive Scenes, and Tuukka Koskinen, lead vocalist of Saattue and Let Me Dream. Merging into Landscapes was released July 1, 2007.
Juhani Palomäki died on May 15, 2010. Juhani was the primus motor and the only remaining full-time founding member of Yearning, hence the band no longer exists after his death. The other members (official or live) have decided not to perform as Yearning nor play Yearning material without Juhani.

Supernatural numbers

In mathematics, the supernatural numbers (sometimes called generalized natural numbers or Steinitz numbers) are a generalization of the natural numbers. They were used by Ernst Steinitz in 1910 as a part of his work on field theory.
A supernatural number formula_1 is a formal product:
where formula_3 runs over all prime numbers, and each formula_4 is zero, a natural number or infinity. Sometimes formula_5 is used instead of formula_4. If no formula_7 and there are only a finite number of non-zero formula_4 then we recover the positive integers. Slightly less intuitively, if all formula_4 are formula_10, we get zero. Supernatural numbers extend beyond natural numbers by allowing the possibility of infinitely many prime factors, and by allowing any given prime to divide formula_1 "infinitely often," by taking that prime's corresponding exponent to be the symbol formula_10.
There is no natural way to add supernatural numbers, but they can be multiplied, with formula_13. Similarly, the notion of divisibility extends to the supernaturals with formula_14 if formula_15 for all formula_3. The notion of the least common multiple and greatest common divisor can also be generalized for supernatural numbers, by defining
With these definitions, the gcd or lcm of infinitely many natural numbers (or supernatural numbers) is supernatural number.
We can also extend the usual formula_3-adic order functions to supernatural numbers by defining formula_20 for each formula_3
Supernatural numbers are used to define orders and indices of profinite groups and subgroups, in which case many of the theorems from finite group theory carry over exactly. They are also used implicitly in many number-theoretical proofs, such as the density of the square-free integers and bounds for odd perfect numbers.

Anne Bailey (ten-pin bowling)

Anne Mary Bailey (born 1 June 1951) is a British-born ten-pin bowling champion. She is best known for winning the Bronze medal in the 1972 AMF World Cup tournament, held in Hamburg, West Germany.
Bailey was born in Kent, England, but relocated to Hong Kong, China as a child. A full-time secretary by trade, she became a local bowling phenomenon around the country, which was under British rule at the time. Along with her father Bill Bailey (born 1919—d. 1979), the "father-and-daughter" team were local celebrities throughout the Asian as well as English bowling community.
AMF Bowling World Cup.
Bailey's fame led to her inclusion in the AMF Bowling World Cup tournament in 1972. Representing Hong Kong, Bailey was one of three women who took "one giant step for womankind," as the media reported. For the first time in bowling history, female bowlers joined males in the World Cup competition. Mexico's grandmotherly Irma Urrea won the Gold Medal in the tournament, followed by Silver Medalist Oy Sri-Saard of Thailand. In contrast with her older opponents, Bailey was just 21 at the time of the tournament, of which she won the Bronze Medal.
Upon her return trip to China, Bailey arrived at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong and was treated "like royalty," as she put it in 2008. "It was such a wonderful experience."
Bailey retired from the sport in the late 1990s. During her career, she bowled with a 15-pound ball, complete with a semi-fingertipped grip.
Personal life.
Bailey currently resides in the Kent, England, and goes by her married name of Anne Huddleston. She has one daughter. Bailey looks back on her bowling career with great fondness, and is proud to have been a part of "making history."

Harvard Club of Boston

The Harvard Club of Boston is a private social club located in Boston, Massachusetts. Its membership is essentially restricted to alumni and associates of Harvard University. It has two clubhouses, a main clubhouse located in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood, at 374 Commonwealth Avenue, and a Downtown clubhouse on the top floor of One Federal Street, in Boston's Financial District.
History.
The Harvard Club was founded by a group of 22 Harvard alumni in 1908. The original dues were $5.00 per year, and by the end of the year, more than 1,200 members had joined. The first president, Henry Lee Higginson, was also the founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1909, the Club established its first scholarships. One of the first recipients of these scholarships, James Bryant Conant, went on to become the 23rd president of Harvard. Famous people to have spoken at the Club include Vice President Dick Cheney, Eleanor Roosevelt, Henry Kissinger, William Taft, Robert Frost, Buckminster Fuller and John Foster Dulles. In 1913, the Club decided to construct a clubhouse, the Main Clubhouse at 374 Commonwealth Avenue. In 1925, eight squash courts were built. During World War II, cots were placed in these courts and lodging was offered to military officers at the cost of $1.50 per night. In 1976, the Downtown clubhouse was purchased at One Federal Street, providing a location more convenient to most of Boston's offices.
Membership.
Membership eligibility is restricted to anyone who has received a degree or honorary degree from Harvard, a full-time student at the university, faculty members, those holding appointments at any of Harvard's teaching hospitals, and children and grandchildren of current members. Dues are on a sliding scale, based on age and proximity to the Club. Like most private clubs, members of the Harvard Club are given reciprocal benefits at 130 clubs around the United States and the world.
Clubhouse.
The Clubhouse's facilities include three dining rooms, the Grill Room, the Boston Room, and the Commonwealth Lounge, guest rooms, ten squash courts, a fitness center, guest rooms, and numerous function rooms, including Harvard Hall, which has hosted events ranging from prize fights to squash matches. Dress code for dinner in the Boston Room is jacket and tie, but otherwise, the code is business casual.
Harvard Club Foundation.
The Harvard Club maintains a Foundation, with a separate Board of Directors from the club's Board of Governors, which oversees assets in excess of $10,000,000. The purpose of the Foundation is to support the activities of the University, primarily through providing undergraduate financial aid. The Foundation also supports the University's undergraduate admissions program by hosting receptions for admitted students, as well as sponsoring the Prize Book program. In 2008, the Foundation donated $510,944 to undergraduate financial aid.

Swamini Vato

The Swamini Vato is a set of quotations and sayings of Gunatitanand Swami. It is a scripture in the Swaminarayan denomination of the Hindu religion. It was documented in the mid 19th century over the course of Gunatitanand Swami's 40 year tenure as the mahant of Junagadh Mandir.
Biography.
Gunatitanand Swami was born in the village of Bhadra in modern-day Gujarat, India, on October 17, 1785 (on the occasion of Sharad Poonam). Originally named Mulji Sharma, as a child, he was engaged in the devotion of God at an early age. He was initiated as Gunatitanand Swami by Swaminarayan as a paramhansa of the Swaminarayan Sampraday.
Philosophy.
Through his talks, Swamini Vato, Gunatitanand Swami gave advice for every aspect of life and beyond. Topics ranged from the glory of God, and how to gain spiritual knowledge, to how to attain peace and happiness. The scripture is believed to have discussed the value of human life itself.
Compilation and Publishing.
When Gunatitanand Swami delivered discourses, devotees took notes on his talks. The notes were later studied by Achintyanand Brahmachari, after being asked by Gunatitanand Swami to continue giving discourses on these topics. At this point, the Swamini Vato was officially dubbed a scripture by the Original Swaminarayan Sampraday. The original set of Vatos has 5 "prakrans" (chapters) and was written by Sadhu Balmukund Dasji, who was a disciple of Gunatitanand Swami. 
The BAPS sect has published a new edition of the Vatos which includes the addition of two more "prakrans" compiled by Krishnaji Ada, another disciple of Gunatitanand Swami, based on claims of the latest research and critical study of the original text.

Heiankyo Alien

Gameplay.
The player controls a Heian period police officer ("kebiishi") who must defend the capital city (Heian-kyō) from an alien invasion by digging holes in the ground and filling them back up after an alien falls inside. The player scores points for every alien trapped, and the quicker the hole is filled up after the alien falls in, the higher the number of points are scored. The aliens increase in number as the levels progress, and they can escape from holes after a certain period of time elapses or if another alien passes above their hole. The player loses if he comes in contact with an alien. There is a time limit for each level, and the number of aliens increases drastically when this limit is reached, essentially preventing the player from completing the level.
The player can enter his name on the arcade machine if a high score is reached. In the original version of the game, a unique cursor is employed where the player selects a letter by having his character walk through the street that displays the desired letter. The game also contains a two-player mode, where the players can either alternate turns or play on the same screen simultaneously.
The arcade version uses a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, and the arcade system board used is a copied version of the one used by Sega's "Head On". Since the original system board itself was a copy, "Heian-kyō Alien"s system board was easily duplicated, and many of the units distributed to arcade centers were "copies of a copy" created by other companies. Few of the original units manufactured by Denki Onkyō remain in place today.

Arcade versions.
Many copied arcade versions of the game exist with differences in background color and sound effects. Taito Corporation produced a version with a light-blue background that recycled many sound effects from "Head On". The unit's cabinet and instruction card were created specifically for the version by Taito, but it is not known whether the version was a licensed manufacture or a copy. Hōei Sangyō (now Banpresto) produced an arranged version called "Time Alien" where alien movements are much quicker (however, the game lags whenever the player tries to dig or fill up a hole). In 1980, a North American version titled "Digger" (unrelated to the Canadian computer game "Digger") was created by Sega and Gremlin Industries, with minor changes in appearance.
Ports.
Meldac released a Game Boy version of the game in Japan and North America in 1990. This port includes a remake version where a new type of alien appears to chase after the player's character. The game was also ported to the Super Famicom by Nihon Bussan in 1995 as "Nichibutsu Arcade Classics 2: Heiankyo Alien". The company had previously released a licensed remake titled "Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen". The game was also made available for the Microsoft Windows operating system in 1999 by Hyperware, and various mobile phone versions are available on i-mode, Vodafone live!, and EZweb.
Similar games.
"Heiankyo Alien" is an early example of the "trap-em-up" genre. Further "trap-em-up" platform games bear similarities to "Heiankyo Alien" in that the player must dig holes to lure and trap enemies. "Space Panic" (1980) and its clones also feature trappable aliens while "Lode Runner"'s (1983) enemies are human guards. "Doraemon Meikyū Daisakusen" (1989) and "Boomer's Adventure in ASMIK World" (1989) are later examples. The Commodore VIC-20 cartridge game "Alien" appears to be a direct clone of "Heiankyo Alien". Other examples include "Mouse Trap" (1981) and "Apple Panic" (1981).

James Long (filibuster)

James Long (born February 9, 1793 Culpepper County Virginia died 8 April 1822 in a Mexico military prison) led the unsuccessful filibuster Long Expedition to Texas.
Biography.
Long was a former US Army surgeon in the War of 1812 who served at the Battle of New Orleans. He married Jane Herbert Dent Wilkinson in 1815 and owned a plantation in Natchez, Mississippi.
Many Americans and French settlers the American southwest were opposed to the Adams-Onis treaty of 1819 that settled the border dispute between the United States and Spain. Long teamed up with José Félix Trespalacios a former Mexican who had fought against Spanish rule in Mexico. They made their first filibuster expedition to Texas in 1819. And he also attempted to recruit Jean Lafitte and his men, but Lafitte turned him down. Several of Long's recruits were former French soldiers who had started a settlement in Texas the Champ d'Asile that Spanish troops crushed in 1818. Long was successful in capturing Nacogdoches, with his followers proclaiming Long the first President of the Republic of Texas, which lasted only one month, and is not affiliated with the Republic of Texas that was the result of the Texas Revolution. However a Spanish expedition routed Long and his followers.
Long led a second unsuccessful expedition from the Bolivar Peninsula the following year bringing his pregnant wife Jane Long and 300 troops. Then his troops seized Presidio La Bahía. He was caught and imprisoned, then shot in Mexico by a guard 6 months later. One of Long's followers, Benjamin Milam believed that Trespalacios who had been captured and freed was responsible.
His widow, Jane Long, claimed to be the first woman of English descent to settle in Texas gave birth to Mary James Long the first child born in Texas of English descent, a claim which has been disproved by census records from 1807 to 1826, which show a number of Anglo-American births. Throughout a long winter, she and her children struggled as she waited for her husband's return. At one point, several Karankawa Indians appeared, but Long fired a cannon each day to make them think there was an army stationed there. Finally, during the spring, Long heard of her husband's death. She then, with some friendly travelers, left Texas, hoping to one day return, and she did. She came back in 1820s as a bonafide colonist.

Leo Crowley

Leo Thomas Crowley (August 15, 1889–1972) was a member of the cabinet of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the head of the Foreign Economic Administration. Previously he had served as Alien Property Custodian and as chief of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He also served President Harry Truman but due to philosophical differences, such as the advisability of conscription, declined to continue in Washington.
Early life.
Leo Crowley was born to Thomas and Katie Crowley in Milton, Wisconsin. His father worked for the Milwaukee Road. Young Leo delivered groceries and saved his tips from customers. In 1905, with $1000 he bought a part of the General Paper Company, some of the products of which he had been bringing to customers. He worked hard to grow the company, and his share in it, until he owned it outright in 1919. That year he took over the T. S. Morris company with financing from Milo Hagen and W.D. Curtis. Selling stock in this company relieved its debt, and he bought a wholesale grocery for his brothers to run, and land in Madison, Wisconsin.
Political life.
Crowley began his entry into the political arena by supporting Albert G. Schmedeman for governor of Wisconsin. The biographer Weiss says “He managed Schmedeman as a parent might his children, and as he managed his family and most of the nurses at Saint Mary’s Hospital.”(p. 7)
Crowley served as a delegate for Al Smith at the Democratic National Convention. He thus came in contact with Jouett Shouse and John J. Raskob, operatives for Al Smith. Progressivism was strong in Wisconsin, as expressed by Senator John J. Blaine and the newspaper "Capital Times" edited by William T. Evjue. Crowley was effective in bringing about a progressive-democratic alliance for the election of Franklin Roosevelt.
It was the Glass–Steagall Act that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), one of the most popular elements of the New Deal. The biographer Weiss tells of the incredible tale of how the nearly-bankrupt Crowley became the figurehead for banking security in a time of common bank runs. 
Crowley's special capacity for smoothing troubled waters drew him closer to FDR. A wartime cabinet level conflict involving foreign economic operations in Europe and North Africa threatened cabinet solidarity. So Crowley became head of the Foreign Economic Administration in September 1943, with responsibility for Lend-Lease and Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., was promoted to Undersecretary of State. Crowley was now a cabinet member in the Roosevelt administration.
The skeleton in Crowley’s closet was his misappropriation of funds in 1931, early in the Great Depression. Though disguised, his banking misdeeds threatened to undo his place in political diplomacy, for instance years later when Henry Morgenthau, Jr. or Arthur Vandenberg were checking his credentials. His unusually close relations with the President and James F. Byrnes, as well as adroit personal moves, preserved him in office. He had received the Order of Saint Gregory the Great from Pope Pius XI in 1929. He was an early target of I. F. Stone, whose investigations were republished by the "Capital Times" in Madison.
Later life.
Back in the business world, Crowley was named chairman of the "Milwaukee Road" in December 1945 and made it turn a profit until the mid-1960s. He continued contact with the White House:
President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Crowley to the United States Commission on Civil Rights in his second term, and he was known to have dined with Lyndon Johnson. He died in 1972. 
Very negatively for Crowley in 1955, Harry Truman wrote about how Crowley had caused a problem with the Russians when Germany was defeated. The episode was recounted by daughter Margaret Truman in 1973. She adds:

Martian Monkey

The Martian Monkey is the name given to the monkey used by Edward Watters, Tom Wilson and Arnold Payne to perpetrate a hoax in Atlanta, Georgia in 1953.
The hoax.
In Atlanta 1953, young barbers Edward Watters and Tom Wilson, along with butcher Arnold Payne, took a dead rhesus monkey and removed its tail, applied large doses of hair remover and used green food coloring to make the corpse of the monkey appear abnormal. They then used a blow torch to create a burning circle in the pavement. Officer Sherley Brown came across the scene by accident and was told by the hoaxers that they had seen many creatures just like it. They claimed that they had hit the dead one with their truck and the other creatures had left in their flying saucer, which is what caused the scorch marks.
The prank was played at the height of UFO hysteria in the United States. As a result, the Atlanta Police Department received constant phone calls after news of the story broke, with multiple residents adamant they had seen the flying saucer that the pranksters described. The situation was propelled further when a veterinarian agreed that the animal was not from Earth. The United States Air Force was also called in to investigate.
Hoax revealed.
The hoax was discovered hours after the event by Dr. Herman Jones and Emory University anatomy professor Dr. Marion Hines. They found that the anatomy of the creature was identical to that of a monkey and Hines is quoted as saying "If it came from Mars, they have monkeys on Mars."
Wilson, Payne and Watters eventually admitted to the hoax. Watters was made to pay a $40 fine "for obstructing a highway."
Present day.
The Martian Monkey is now on display in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation mini-museum, along with other notable items, such as an illegal moonshine still and the fibers that solved the Atlanta child murders. The exhibit is showcased along with the news report that was published at the time.

Sicco van Goslinga

Sicco van Goslinga (Herbaijum, Friesland, 1664—Dongjum, September 20, 1731) was a Dutch statesman and diplomat, who served as "gedeputeerde te velde" (deputy-in-the-field, a kind of political commissar) of the States-General of the Dutch Republic with John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough during his campaigns in Flanders in the War of the Spanish Succession. His memoirs form an important source of information for historians of the period.
Biography.
Family Life.
Goslinga married Jeanette (Joanne) Isabelle baroness thoe Schwartzenberg und Hohenlansberg, vrijvrouwe of Ameland, at Ballum, Friesland, on June 12, 1692. They had five daughters one of whom, Anna Dodonea, would marry Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer.
Career.
After studies at the University of Franeker and the University of Utrecht he became "Grietman" of Franekeradeel in 1688, a function he would hold until his death. This made him a regent and put him in line for all kinds of functions on a provincial level in the province of Friesland. He also represented that province in the States-General and in the "Raad van State" (Council of State) on many occasions (see "List of functions" in the External Links).
As a member of the Council of State (which was the most important executive organ of the Republic in the military field, especially after the Second Stadtholderless Period had started) he became a "gedeputeerde te velde" for Friesland at the headquarters of the Duke of Marlborough from 1706 until the Duke's dismissal in 1711. As such he was charged with advising the Duke, and with keeping an eye on him, as agreed when Marlborough was made lieutenant-captain-general of the army of the Republic in 1702. The Dutch deputies-in-the-field had the right to veto the Duke's tactical decisions if they thought the interests of the Republic demanded it, and this had led to much friction with Marlborough in previous years. Goslinga, however, proved cooperative generally and managed to provide a positive contribution during the battles of Ramillies, Oudenaarde, and Malplaquet.
Though not a general, he was authorized to give orders to Dutch commanders at these battles. At the Battle of Oudenaarde he took it upon himself to throw a Dutch division into battle at a decisive moment. Another incident had him personally ordering up reinforcements at the battle of Malplaquet, when the second Dutch assault on the left flank faltered. To illustrate the good rapport between the Duke and Goslinga, Churchill mentions the anecdote in which they shared the Duke's cloak to sleep on after the battle of Ramillies. Though Churchill has no high opinion of Goslinga's military abilities he nevertheless extensively used his memoirs as a source.
Goslinga served as plenipotentiary for the Republic at the peace negotiations, leading up to the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). After the conclusion of the peace he served as extraordinary envoy of the Republic to the court of Louis XIV of France in 1714 and 1715. In 1728 he represented the Republic at the congress of Soissons about outstanding European diplomatic issues (like the status of Gibraltar).
Until his death he was involved in Dutch politics. He supported the appointment of William IV, Prince of Orange as stadtholder of Groningen in 1719.

M40 corridor

The M40 corridor is the area adjacent to the M40 motorway running through England. It is one of the main routes between London and Birmingham, the other being that followed by the M1 motorway.
This includes the Chiltern Main Line, which also runs in the same area between the two cities. The route taken by the railway line closely follows the motorway except for the central section where the railway does not serve Oxford. Unlike the motorway, the Chiltern Main Line stretches deep into both cities.
Route.
The area followed by the M40 includes southern Buckinghamshire, eastern Oxfordshire and central/southern Warwickshire. Despite serving London and Birmingham, the M40 does not enter either cites, instead other roads/motorways continue onwards (e.g. the A40 continues right into central London). The motorway runs from to .
South.
The southern end is completely within Buckinghamshire with the town served being High Wycombe. Both road and rail travel in a north west-south east direction.
Central.
The central section covers Oxfordshire and Bucks. The main population centre served is Oxford.
North.
Both rail and road now travel sharply to the north west, serving Warwickshire.
Main towns/cities served.
The following table only includes places situated near the motorway and those close enough to be considered 'near the motorway' (like Aylesbury). Other places that may use the motorway (for access to the north) are not included as they have other motorway access (for example Slough). Small villages are not included. Population figures are based on the 2001 census by the Office for National Statistics [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D8271.xls]
Economy.
Buckinghamshire.
George Wimpey, RAF Air Command, Hyundai UK, Dreams, the UK base of Ariston (now owned by Indesit) and the UK headquarters of Staples are based in High Wycombe. The UK base of Robert Bosch is in Denham, near Gerrards Cross. Pioneer UK is in Stoke Poges and the Barracuda Group (owner of Varsity) is in Marlow, both locations being near the motorway.
Oxfordshire.
Kraft Foods Banbury, Westminster group plc, Prodrive, Ascari Cars and Vodafone Limited all have offices or are based in Banbury.
Warwickshire.
Stratford-upon-Avon is world famous as Shakespeares hometown and so tourism is a major industry. The NFU Mutual Insurance Company is also based in the town. ConocoPhillips, JET (petrol), BMW, and Volvo Group are based in Warwick.

Career.
Wang has partnered with Tian Jia since the start of the 2006 season and they are currently fifth in the world rankings. She won four titles with Tian, most recently in Hong Kong in 2007. The other two came in back-to-back events in Austria and Poland in 2006, and in Shanghai in 2007. A very consistent tandem, the duo has made 15 podium finishes in addition to those four victories, finishing runner-up seven times in 2007 and eight overall, finishing atop the FIVB standings in 2007.
Wang had originally partnered with Linjun Ji upon entering the FIVB circuit in 2003, but made only three top-10 finishes, highlighted by a fifth-place finish in her debut in Greece in 2003, and did not return to beach volleyball until partnering with Tian.
She competed at the beach volleyball event at the 2008 Summer Olympics with Tian. They were undefeated up to the finals where they lost against Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh of the United States, winning the silver medal.

Olinda is a neighborhood in Brea, California, located on Carbon Canyon Road east of the rest of the city. The original village was founded in the 1890s and grew when petroleum was discovered at the adjacent Brea-Olinda Oil Field. In 1911, Olinda Village and the nearby town of Randolph were incorporated as the city of Brea. The site is now registered as California Historical Landmark #918.
Olinda Landfill, located in Carbon Canyon, was opened in 1960 and is scheduled to be closed in December 2021.
The name was revived for a quiet neighborhood built in the hills near the site of the original village, beginning in 1964. The neighborhood has six streets, and holds about 120 homes (many horse properties), a condominium complex, and a small elementary school. It is near Carbon Canyon Regional Park and Chino Hills State Park, and surrounded by hills covered with chaparral and home to coyotes, owls, hawks and rattlesnakes.
A Southern California Edison electrical substation in the area is also named Olinda. Olinda gives its name to an elementary school as well as Brea-Olinda High School, which serves Brea and Olinda.

Washington Block

Washington Block is a Chicago Landmark building located in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States. Designed by Frederick and Edward Baumann it was built between 1873–1874 in the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on January 14, 1997. When completed, Washington Block was one of the tallest buildings in the city of Chicago and is described as a rare example of the "isolated pier foundation" (see below) which contributed to the foundation of knowledge that has made Chicago the birthplace of the skyscraper.The building has limestone facades and originally included an exterior staircase that led to a second-floor corner entrance. The lobby has a curving hardwood staircase. Today the first floor is occupied by a 7-Eleven and the second floor occupied by Carter Legal Group PC. The building, which is located at the corner of North Wells Street and West Washington Street is five stories tall.
The building was originally intended to host upscale offices for companies wanting to be close to the nearby then-blossoming LaSalle Street financial district. However, when the Chicago 'L' was built next to the building, the upscale commercial customer found the building undesirable. During the mid 1900s, the owner hammered off ground-level architectural details in order to modernize the storefronts. 21st century owners have recast some of the details during a restoration.
The isolated pier technique uses several separate foundations, one at each of the load-bearing points underground. Thus, instead of using a single foundation that would crack as the building shifted on sandy soil, a building may be built on a much longer-lasting and sturdier foundation. The Washington Block's foundation enabled it to be built on soft, compressible soil, instead of the solid bedrock formerly seen as a requirement. This ability allowed skyscrapers to be built in places like Chicago, and many of them were.

San Francisco mayoral election, 2003

The 2003 San Francisco mayoral election occurred on November 4, 2003. The incumbent, Willie Brown, was termed out of office and could not seek a third term. The general election included three top candidates including then Supervisor Gavin Newsom and then President of the Board of Supervisors, Matt Gonzalez and former Supervisor Angela Alioto. No candidate received the required majority so the race went into a run-off of the two top candidates, which were Gavin Newsom and Matt Gonzalez. The run-off occurred on December 9, 2003 where Gavin Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco.
Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though most candidates in San Francisco do receive funding and support from various political parties.
In 2003, then-Supervisor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, ran in a large field of challengers, including Board of Supervisors President Matt Gonzalez, Supervisor Tom Ammiano, former Supervisor Angela Alioto, city Treasurer Susan Leal, and former Police Chief Tony Ribera. Newsom and Gonzalez took first and second place, respectively, but neither won a majority, so the two advanced to a runoff election. The election gained international attention, and third party advocates saw it as a chance to dethrone the Democratic Party.
Newsom ran as a moderate against leftist/progressive Gonzalez, a member of the Green Party. It was the first mayoral election in San Francisco that a Green Party candidate took a noticeable amount of the vote. Had he won, Gonzalez would have been the most prominent elected Green Party member in the United States. The election was close, with Gonzalez leading in the polls and winning the popular vote among ballots cast on election day, while Newsom had a larger lead on absentee ballots.

Rob Ryan (baseball)

Rob Ryan (born June 24, 1973 in Havre, Montana) is a former outfielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Oakland Athletics. He attended Washington State University where he played college baseball for the Cougars from 1993–1996, and was drafted by the Diamondbacks in the 26th round (785th overall pick) of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed with the Diamondbacks two days later on June 6. Ryan, who batted and threw left-handed, was listed at 5' 11" in height, and 192 lb in weight.
Major league career.
Debut.
Ryan made his major league debut on August 20, with the Diamondbacks against the Pittsburgh Pirates. They were playing at Three Rivers Stadium, with 23,934 people attending the game. In the top of the seventh inning, Ryan was called to pinch hit for pitcher Greg Swindell, batting ninth. With runners on first and third base, Pirates pitcher Marc Wilkins balked in Ryan's first at-bat, which made all the players on base advance to the next base as a result, with the runner on third, Steve Finley, scoring a run for the Diamondbacks. Ryan ultimately grounded out, second to first, on his at-bat. In the bottom of the seventh, pitcher Dan Plesac was called to replace Ryan, pitching and batting ninth. The Diamondbacks lost the game by the score of 5-4.
Career after debut.
On June 19, , Ryan was traded by the Diamondbacks to the Oakland Athletics for Ryan Christenson. He played his last major league game on October 7 of that year. One year and two days after being traded, on July 21, 2002, Ryan was purchased by the Boston Red Sox from the Athletics. From this point, Ryan was signed, released, or granted free agency multiple times for about the next three years. 
Ryan was then granted free agency on September 30, 2002. On November 18, he signed as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays. On June 19, 2003, the Blue Jays released Ryan, who was signed three days later on June 22, this time by the San Francisco Giants as a free agent. He was granted free agency again on October 15. The Houston Astros signed Ryan as a free agent on February 5, 2004. On June 18, he was yet again granted free agency, just to be signed almost a month later by the Florida Marlins as a free agent on July 19. On October 15, Ryan was granted free agency, and was signed again with the Marlins as a free agent on November 11 after the season ended.

Parandrinae is a subfamily of the longhorn beetle family (Cerambycidae). This subfamily includes only a few genera. These beetles are very atypical for cerambycids, in that the antennae are quite short, and the tarsi have 5 easily-visible segments; they are thus rather similar in appearance to stag beetles.

Rajendravarman II

Rajendravarman II () was the king of the Khmer Empire (region of Angkor in Cambodia), from 944 to 968.
Rajendravarman II was a nephew of former king Yasovarman I. His principal monuments, located in the Angkor region of Cambodia's Siem Reap province, are Pre Rup and East Mebon. 
The king claimed links to the royal line of the Chenla state that had its capital at Bhavapura (the city's location is debated) and predates the start of the Khmer empire in 802 AD. Inscriptions say that the Khmer empire under his tutelage extended to southern Vietnam, Laos and much of Thailand and as far north as southern China. 
An inscription at Pre Rup relates that Rajendravarman II was a great warrior, his sword frequently blood-stained, his body as hard as a diamond. Though the king punished the guilty, the inscription says, he had an ocean of compassion for the innocent. Other inscriptions depict him as organizer of state religious ritual. In one text, he gives an order for the collection of holy oil, in the form of butter, for use in temples.
The king ruled from a great palace designed by his minister Kavindrarimathana. Many scholars believe that Rajendravarman II instituted a system of centralized administration, establishing more direct control over a collection of princes who had been largely independent at their estates in the provinces.
Construction of Banteay Srei, the ornate temple of pink sandstone located north of the main Angkor complex, began during the king's reign.
Rajendravarman II led fighting against the rival state of Champa in the east, and in 950 AD. seized as booty a gold statue in the temple of Po Nagar there.
Rajendravarman II was succeeded by his 10-year-old son, who reigned as Jayavarman V.

The Stress Field Detector, or SFD, is a sensor originally described by Owl Industries of Vancouver BC in 1992 as capable of detecting subsurface discontinuities including faults, fractures and hydrocarbon deposits. It is currently being used for hydrocarbon exploration in aerial surveys and surface surveys by NXT Energy of Calgary and other users.
Device operation.
Original description of SFD by Owl Industries as of Jan 19, 1993 (part of the filings with BC Supreme Court case C944272) only said that the premise behind device's operation was "that there exist above ground, non-electromagnetic energy patterns reflecting various subsurface conditions", same definition was repeated exactly in Pinnacle Oil International brochure from 1996.
NXT Energy Inc. has described SFD in its literature as a device that can measure "changes in subsurface stress fields associated with structural and stratigraphic hydrocarbon traps and reservoirs". 
NXT Energy Inc's. description of the device operation explicitly claims that the device detects an aspect of gravity different from that detected by gravimeters and gravity gradiometry, followed by:
"Regionally, tectonics acting on rock mass will cause a slight increase in matter density due to elevated horizontal stress. That in turn will cause a re-orientation of the gravity field in the direction of maximum horizontal stress".
Since it is precisely the orientation, along with rate of change in all directions, of local gravity field that gravity gradiometry measures, it is not obvious what aspect of gravity company's description of the device operation refers to. 
All published descriptions of the device's operation indicate that it produces time varying electrical output that in case of movement across terrain can be used to locate subsurface anomalies. While very few examples of device's output have been published, earlier descriptions of the device's operation show increased output activity over faults, fractures and oil fields while current NXT Energy literature indicates the opposite.
Commercial use.
First commercial use of SFD was in a joint venture between directors of Owl Industries and a VSE listed company Grand America Minerals (GDM) between 1993 and 1994. A number of wells were drilled with mixed results. As a result of a dispute between various parties involved in that joint venture, GDM was delisted and from that point development of SFD followed at least two separate paths.
Over the years Pinnacle Oil used the technology in joint drilling programs with various industry partners including Calpine Canada, Renaissance Energy Ltd. and Encal Energy Ltd. Independently from Pinnacle Oil, in 2001 Spectrum Oil of Bakersfield CA used the SFD technology in its exploration program. More recently, multiple surveys have been performed in South America, most notably by Pacific Rubiales Energy in Colombia who acquired "1,771 km of stress field detector" data in 2009. Additional SFD surveys continued in Colombia, Argentina, and Guatemala in early 2012.

Elm Park, Winnipeg

Elm Park is a neighbourhood in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is located in the northern section of the district of St. Vital, and is bounded by the Red River on the north, St. Mary's Road on the east, Fermor Avenue on the south, and Dunkirk Drive on the west. As of the 2006 census, Elm Park had a population of 1,710. 
History.
The neighbourhoods of Elm Park and Kingston Crescent (located to the west of Dunkirk Drive) were originally a park founded by Albert William Austin's Winnipeg Street Railway Company in 1890. The trolley company had recently extended a line to just north of the Red River along what is now Osborne Street; by founding Elm Park directly across the river from the end of the trolley line, Austin hoped to increase off-peak and weekend use of the line. The trolley company built a pontoon bridge for foot traffic, and Elm Park soon became a popular summertime destination for Winnipeg residents.
The popularity of Elm Park waned in the 1910s. It closed in approximately 1912 when the pontoon bridge was replaced by a steel truss bridge. Eventually the lands to the east of Dunkirk Drive were bought by the City of St. Vital; the new neighbourhood was named Elm Park after the former park. Although most of the land in the east of the new neighbourhood was converted into single-family housing (with some apartment buildings along St. Mary's Road), most of the land in the southwest corner was converted into the home of the Winnipeg Canoe Club, eventually becoming a private golf course. There are also three small public parks remaining of what was once Elm Park - Dean Finlay Park on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Killarney Street, Carey Park on Elm Park Road, and St. Vital Memorial Park on Fermor Avenue. Many of the older oak, ash, elm, and cottonwood trees were retained during development and line the streets of the current subdivision.
Many buildings in Elm Park were damaged by the 1950 Red River Flood. The neighbourhood was one of the worst hit areas in the city. The St. Vital Fire Hall, which was opened in 1914, sheltered refugees during the flood and was featured in a "Life" magazine article about the disaster. 
In 1960, the municipality of St. Vital moved into a new City Hall located in Elm Park directly south of the fire hall. The building is still in use as a municipal office for the City of Winnipeg.
Elm Park was protected during the 2009 Red River flood by both the Red River Floodway and by the use of sandbags on Kingston Row.
Amenities.
Elm Park is the home of Glenlawn Collegiate, Windsor School, the South Winnipeg YM/YWCA, and St. Mark's Anglican Church. It is in the federal riding of Saint Boniface and the provincial riding of St. Vital.

Cinimod Studio

Cinimod Studio is a London-based design studio involved in various architecture and lighting design projects. Projects undertaken typically involve a wide mix of media and technologies, and often involve interactive design.
Beginnings.
In 2007 architect Dominic Harris founded Cinimod Studio. He had trained at the Bartlett School of Architecture and worked for many years with architecture firms Future Systems and Softroom, and for the interactive design firm Jason Bruges Studio.
The Studio.
Cinimod Studio operates from a Notting Hill studio. In October 2008, director Dominic Harris was the recipient of the "Breakthrough Talent of the Year" at the FX International Interior Design Awards 2008. In November 2009, Cinimod Studio was awarded "Best Bar or Restaurant" at the FX International Design Awards 2009. In 2010 the studio won further recognition at the Lighting Design Awards 2010, winning "Best Hotel or Restaurant" lighting scheme. In 2012 Cinimod Studio won 2 further awards at the Lighting Design Awards 2012 with first prize in the "Small Retail Projects" and "Special Projects" category. The studio consists of a multi-disciplinary team of designers that includes architects, product designers, lighting designers and software engineers.
Notable projects.
SNOG Pure Frozen Yogurt.
Cinimod Studio is responsible for the architecture and lighting design for the British company, Snog Pure Frozen Yogurt. The first store in South Kensington integrates a digital sky feature element made up of over 3,000 LEDs behind a stretched plast ceiling. Displayed on the LED sky are digital clouds, "their colour and speed determined by the time of day." The second store in Soho instead features a ceiling lighting installation consisting of 700 globes of individually colour-changing light. The third location, again designed by Cinimod Studio, is a kiosk at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Shepherd's Bush, London. A fourth location, by Cinimod Studio, has opened in Covent Garden, London. A fifth location opened in King's Road, Chelsea, in December 2010. The studio has also been responsible for the international locations, including those in Brazil, Columbia, Dubai, Kuwait and Pakistan.
UFO Project (Peter Coffin).
"Untitled (UFO)" is an art project conceived by established New York artist Peter Coffin. Cinimod Studio was hired to realise the project, and produced an innovative structural, technical and electrical design and oversaw the fabrication and assembly. The UFO was publicly shown for the first time at the "Festival Of Stars" in Gdansk, Poland, on 4 July 2008.
The object measured 7 metres in diameter and was manufactured of aluminum with 3000 bright and individually controllable Color Kinetics LED nodes arrayed across the structure, controlled via solid state computer. The system was powered by an on-board 6 kW generator and the craft was remotely controlled via SMS messaging. The craft weighed 600 kg, and was controlled during its unveiling flight from a Mi2 helicopter piloted by mountain rescue pilots.
Hoxton Square Exploded Globe.
To celebrate the launch of the new Restaurant and Bar Design Awards, Cinimod Studio was commissioned to create an outdoor interactive lighting installation suspended within the tree canopy over London's famed Hoxton Square.
Beacon Interactive Art Installation.
In January 2009 Cinimod Studio collaborated with artist and designer Chris O'Shea to create an interactive lighting artwork made of modified police beacon lights that responded in realtime to the movement of visitors to the installation space. The artwork was first exhibited in the Science Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, and then in the Kinetica Art Fair in London, England.
Itsu "Butterfly In Flight".
Cinimod Studio are responsible for the new "Butterfly in Flight" lighting features that are now appearing in Itsu sushi restaurants across London, UK. These lighting features consist of sculptured forms of edge-lit acrylic through which computer controlled sequences of coloured LED lights are sequenced, creating the dynamic effect of a butterfly fluttering through the artwork. 
Flutter.
"Flutter" is an interactive artwork by Dominic Harris, the founder and director of Cinimod Studio, that was first exhibited at the Kinetica Art Fair 2010. It is the detailed study of the movement of a butterfly as if displayed on an un-wrapped zoetrope.
DJ Light.
DJ Light was a large scale Son et lumière project created by Cinimod Studio for Endessa in Lima, Peru, for Christmas 2010. It consisted of 85 inflatable globes of light that were individually controllable in both color and lighting intensity. The installation was operated by invited members of the public who would stand on the designated podium. A thermal camera tracked their arm and body movements and via software written in Max Msp software the interactive light and sounds controls were made.
Peru National Football Stadium.
Cinimod Studio were commissioned to create an interactive lighting control system for the new facade lighting that was part of the 2011 refurbishment program of the Estadio Nacional (Lima), Peru's National Football Stadium. Their design consisted of a sound level monitoring system that was analysed in real-time to determine the mood of the crowd. This analysis was in turn output as lighting patterns across the stadium facade. The system was inaugurated in July 2011 and remains a permanent part of the stadium.
London Eye Mood Conductor.
Cinimod Studio created an interactive lighting control system for the London Eye attraction on the London Southbank. A gestural control system and a heart rate monitor let visitors control the lighting across the London Eye in an interactive way. The installation ran through the London 2012 Olympic period.
Walk The Light.
For the 2012 London Design Festival the studio created an interactive lighting installation at the underground tunnel entrance to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The installation consisted of a physically moving beam of white light that tracked visitors via thermal camera sensors.

Necydalinae

Necydalinae is a small subfamily of the longhorn beetle family (Cerambycidae), historically treated as a tribe within the subfamily Lepturinae, but recently recognized as a separate subfamily. These beetles are unusual for cerambycids, in that the elytra are quite short; they are thus rather similar in appearance to rove beetles, though most are actually bee or wasp mimics.

In 1990, he left school to pursue his professional career, but returned to graduate in 1991. He was inducted into the University of Vermont Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.
Professional.
In 1990, Wylie spent one season with the New Mexico Chiles of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). Wylie then returned to Vermont to complete his education. At this point, Wylie’s career becomes vague. His Vermont Hall of Fame bio states that he played for the New Mexico Chiles from 1991 to 1993. However, the Chiles lasted only the 1990 season. In 1991, the New Mexico Roadrunners were renamed the Chiles, but Wylie is not listed on any of their rosters from 1991 to 1996. His Hall of Fame bio states that Wylie returned to the northeast after the 1993 season to play for the Cape Cod Crusaders of the USISL. That matches with the founding of the Crusaders in 1994. In May 1996, Wylie completed a successful trial with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. He played twenty-two games that season before being released. He then began the 1997 season with the Crusaders before being called up to the Revs for three games. New England waived him on May 29, 1997 and he finished the season with the Vermont Wanderers. The Wanderers were sold at the end of the season and the new ownership renamed the team the Vermont Voltage. Wylie signed with the Voltage on February 8, 1998, but left the team during the preseason. At this point, Wylie’s career again becomes difficult to follow. It appears that he moved to Boston in the spring of 1998 with a mention that he may have played for the Boston Bulldogs. However, other records show him playing for the Crusadars in 1998 and 1999.

Philip Claypool

Philip Claypool (born in Memphis, Tennessee) is an American country music artist. Between 1995 and 1999, he recorded two studio albums for the Curb Records label (1995's "A Circus Leaving Town" and 1999's "Perfect World"), in addition to charting four singles on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. His highest-charting single was a cover of Bad Company's 1975 hit "Feel Like Makin' Love."
Biography.
Philip Claypool was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. His mother, a church organist, influenced him to take interest in gospel music. By the time he was in high school, Claypool had begun writing songs as well, and by age 21, he had made his first professional performance.
By 1995, Claypool had signed to Curb Records as a recording artist. Working with producer Jerry Crutchfield, he released his debut album "A Circus Leaving Town" that same year. This album produced four chart singles on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts (now Hot Country Songs). Among these were the title track (which was later recorded by Travis Tritt on his 2004 album "My Honky Tonk History") and Claypool's highest-charting hit, a cover of British band Bad Company's 1975 single "Feel Like Makin' Love".
Claypool's debut album received a three-star rating from Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic, who called it "a diverse collection on a solid contemporary base", with "intriguing" production that "sav[ed even the weakest tracks". Dan Kuchar of "Country Standard Time" noted Claypool's "leather and velvet" voice but said that, except for the Bad Company cover and one other song, the material was largely "tired, cliché-laden… devoid of any hooks". Claypool himself described the album as being "left of center". In a 1996 interview with "Modern Screen's Country Music" magazine, he called it "more mature" but "a little distanced from what is happening radio-wise".
Claypool also recorded a song for the soundtrack to the 1998 film "" His self-produced second album, "Perfect World", was released in 1999, although it contained no chart singles and mostly comprised material from his first album. In late 2012, Claypool recorded his first album in over a decade. Scheduled to be released in 2013, it was produced by Michael Lloyd. The first single from the album, "I'm Gonna Lie", was released on March 18, 2013.

Lepturinae

Lepturinae, the lepturine beetles, is a subfamily of the longhorn beetle family (Cerambycidae), containing about 150 genera worldwide. This lineage is most diverse in the Northern Hemisphere. Until recently the subfamily Necydalinae was included within the lepturines, but this has been recently recognized as a separate subfamily. At least 5 tribes are usually recognized today; some authors have proposed additional ones, but at least some of them appear to be invalid. A few genera are of uncertain placement within the subfamily.
Usually among the smaller members of their family, these beetles are of a slender shape – particularly the thorax is markedly less wide than the wings, while the elytra tips are often pointed. They differ from most other longhorn beetles in that the antennae are not directly adjacent to the compound eyes. Hence, the latter are generally oval in outline, rather than having an indentation where the antennae originate, or even being divided by them. In addition, sexual dichromatism is not infrequently seen in lepturines; usually, longhorn beetles are not dimorphic or only have longer antennae in males.
Tribes and genera.
Lepturinae contains the following genera:
Tribe Desmocerini:
Tribe Encyclopini:
Tribe Rhagiini (including Oxymirini, Rhamnusiini):
Tribe Xylosteini:
Tribe Lepturini:
Incertae sedis:

Edwin Bryant (cricketer)

Edwin Harvey Bryant (12 September 1886—24 October 1948) was an English cricketer who played 16 first-class games for Worcestershire in the 1920s. He top-scored with 41 in the second innings of his debut against Yorkshire,
but his career was not successful.
Bryant made 63 in the first innings against Essex in June 1924,
but this was to prove his only half-century. Indeed, his duck in the second innings of that match began a dreadful sequence of scores: he was dismissed for nought five times in six innings (making just 5 in the other), and for single figures in the four innings immediately thereafter.
He played his last match against Nottinghamshire in June 1925; his final innings was another duck.

Olson Park and Waterfall 
was a heavily visited park and waterfall complex that was located in the Avondale community area of Chicago. It was built by Walter E. Olson, the owner of the Olson Rug Company, next to his factory and headquarters on the northwest corner of Diversey and Pulaski, and was a popular landmark for Chicago families. Built during the Great Depression the park was open to the public until it was closed in 1971 after Marshall Field bought the complex in 1965. The "Chicago Tribune" named Olson Park as the first of "Chicago's Seven Lost Wonders". The park's opening was famous for the fact that during its opening, the park was symbolically "deeded" back to Native Americans, observing the hundred year anniversary of the expulsion of Indians across the Mississippi River after the Blackhawk War. Today the site is occupied by a parking lot for the former Olson Rug factory and headquarters which is now occupied by the retailer Macy's.
The area is near of one of Chicago's "Polish Patches", Jackowo, and the complex was a few blocks from St. Hyacinth Basilica as well as Kosciuszko Park.

Liao Hui (weightlifter)

Liao Hui (; born October 5, 1987 in Xiantao, Hubei) is a Chinese weightlifter. He is an Olympic champion and two time world champion, as well as the world record holder in the clean and jerk () and in the total () in the 69 kg class.
In 2007 at the 6th Chinese City Games he broke two junior world records and won gold in the 69 kg class. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing he won the gold medal in the 69 kg class with a total of 348 kg. In 2009 and 2013 he won the World Weightlifting Championships. He also won the 2010 World Weightlifting Championships before being retroactively disqualified for performance enhancing drug use the following year.
Liao became a member of the national weightlifting team in early 2007. After breaking two junior world records in 2007, he became a candidate for the Chinese national team at the 2008 Olympics after previously having been a backup for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He replaced Zhang Guozheng, the gold medalist in the 69 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Liao won the Olympic gold medal in the 69 kg class at the 2008 Olympics by lifting 158 kg in the snatch and 190 kg in the clean and jerk for a total of 348 kg.
Liao won the gold medal in the 69 kg class at the 2009 World Weightlifting Championships, achieving a 346 kg total.
At the 2010 World Weightlifting Championships, Liao placed first and broke the world records for both the clean and jerk and the total in the 69 kg class by lifting 198 kg and 358 kg, respectively. However, in November 2011, the International Weightlifting Federation announced that Liao had tested positive for the banned substances boldenone and androstatrienedione. As a result the IWF subsequently disqualified Liao from the 2010 WWC, revoking his gold medals and invalidating his record breaking lifts. Liao was initially banned from competition until September 30, 2014 but his ban was reduced to September, 2012 because it was a first time offense.
Liao competed for China in the 69 kg class at the 2013 World Weightlifting Championships, winning the gold with the highest snatch, clean and jerk, and total.

Silent Football

Silent Football is a group game composed of three major elements: Football, the Quiet Game, and Parliamentary procedure, consisting mainly of the passing of an imaginary football. Silent Football requires little set up: only a quiet space with room enough for three or more players to form a circle, allowing each player to see all other players. Silent Football is commonly played at Unitarian Universalist rallies and cons.
In the variations of Silent Football that result in a "loser," one loses by the accumulation of a set number of penance points (set by the Dictator at the beginning of the game (usually 3, 5 or 10).
All players are arranged in a circle, and one player is selected, if not already appointed by a higher spiritual power, to be "Brother Dictator", or "Mister Dictator" (or the more capitalist variant: "Mr Commissioner, Sir", or another variant may be "Grand Master". Also used is the Game Master. The Dictator is responsible for running the game, does the majority of the talking, and interprets the rules given his or her certain dictatorial style. While this may include creating, altering, or removing rules, straying too far from the generally accepted rules can result in a quorum of dictatorial challenge. 
The game begins with each player introducing themselves for the evening (Picking pseudonyms); i.e. Brother "High School Honors Student" or Sister Cockroach. In some variations players are referred to as simply "Player" rather than brother or sister. (In the capitalist version The players are often called "Misters," because in this variation, all of the players are addressed as "Mr., Miss, or Mrs.(insert full first name)", in another variation players create nicknames that they must keep every game they ever play.) Pseudonyms may consist of words, motions, or both. Should a pseudonym include both, both the words and the motions must be used. 
Once everyone is arranged, the Dictator must clear any misunderstandings about the rules with either his own interpretation or arbitrary legislation. In some silent football communities, teaching the basic rules of the game is forbidden. New/prospective players must play/watch a round to learn the rules in those communities, however there is also a fifteen-minute rule, which forbids outsiders to watch for more than fifteen minutes, after which time the offending outsider must either join or leave. Also, to keep things less complicated, some players simply say "Silent football is neither silent, nor is it football" when talking about it, unless it is before actually playing in which case rules will be taught.
Gestures in game play.
Offensive moves.
Fwap.
The first offensive move is called the Fwap, also known as a Thwack or Thwap. One performs a fwap by hitting one's knees in a combination of right knee and left knee (some variations turn their hand over, after the hit, in the given direction). One must hit their right knee with their right hand and their left knee with their left hand. Doing otherwise is called a cross fwap, for which a player may receive Penance Points.
Every hit of the right knee moves the Silent Football a space to the right. Every hit of the left knee moves the Silent Football one space to the left. One may hit their knees in any combination of rights and lefts with a few restrictions.(Many variants require that the movement of the ball must never be reversed by a fwap. IE: If a player fwaps to the right to you, you may not fwap to the left.)
Zoom.
The second offensive move is called the Zoom. The Zoom is performed by extending your right hand in a fist and making eye contact with the player to whom you wish to zoom. The player with whom you make eye contact is passed the silent football. Whether or not the direction of the fist must also point to the same person varies among different rules. A variation on this move is performed by putting your right hand by your left ear, and putting your nose in the crook of that elbow ("Classic Zoom"). The elbow must point towards the person to whom one wishes to zoom, and eye contact must also be made. According to some, you cannot zoom the ball to the person right next to you.
Shwah.
A third offensive move is called the Shwah. Many communities do not include this move in their rules for Silent Football. The Shwah is viewed as obnoxious. The Shwah is performed by extending your right hand with your fingers pointed as if holding a small ball in your fingertips and saying very loudly and shrilly "SHWAH!" and making eye contact. The silent football is then passed to the player with whom eye contact was made. An unorthodox move considering the breaking of silence. The Shwah is also unblockable, meaning: 
Continental.
A fourth offensive maneuver is called the "Continental". This pass is between the ball carrier and a player that is more than 2 seats away from the carrier on either side. The player in possession of the ball must make direct eye contact with the other player, immediately both players perform a thwack. The first thwack from the ball carrier is to pass the ball to the other player, and the thwack performed by the recipient of the pass is done to pass the ball to a player on either side.
Shmeed.
A fifth and very commonly used move is the "Shmeed." It is performed by cupping ones right hand on the back of ones neck. And then pointing the elbow of the bent arm at the person who is to receive the ball. You may Shmeed a Shmeed, but you may not Shmeed a Shmeeded Shmeed. For new players the Commissioner commonly uses the three basic moves. The Shrug, the Shmodus, and the Shmeed. The rest of the moves are considered extra and obnoxious in most circles.
Defensive moves.
Shrug.
The first defensive move is the Shrug. The shrug is performed just as the name implies: one raises one's shoulders. The shrug passes the Silent Football back to the player who passed it.
Shmotus.
The second defensive move is the Shmotus, Shrotem, Shrodem, Shrodum, Shmotus, Scrotum, Shmota, Smodem, or Shamotus. The move is executed in varying ways among different groups, but its effect is consistent everywhere: the Shmotus returns the silent football to the previous passer. 
Execution.
Depending on the group, the Shmotus is performed in one of the following the ways:
Golden Rule.
This is the most important rule. Breaking this rule will cause you to automatically lose the game:
This divides the universe by 0, which (in some groups) must be recognized by all players by loud yelling and potentially rolling on the ground. While some do not recognize it as an instant loss, many find it to be the worst of the rules to break and a large amount of penance is usually awarded. 
In some circles, however, the rule is deemed no more important than any other, and a player may shrug a Shmotus, but never Shmotus a shrug. The shrug is the more polite way to refuse possession of the ball, while the Shmotus is more abrasive. It's just rude to face someone's politeness with an abrasive move. Whereas meeting someone's abrasiveness with politeness is accepted. This is commonly remembered as "One can hug a Shmotus, but one cannot Shmotus a hug," or when the move is referred to as a Shrodum, "You can hug a scrotum, but you can't scrotum a hug," is a useful memory tool.
Call of nature.
If a player must visit the restroom, that player may use the restroom signal: waving their raised hand. The Dictator will simply nod and that person can get up. At the Dictator's discretion, the player may or may not have to wait until the next round of Silent Football motion to rejoin the circle.
A player may also request to leave for a few moments. This may or may not be granted by the dictator.
Variations.
Myriad variations and newer moves to the game exist within different communities, sometimes causing the game to become incredibly complicated. One such example is the phenomenon of Wormholes/Parallel Universes (SWUUSI). Another is the "split ball" effect at Ferry Beach—caused by baps and shwees, and used only by the Dictator.
Initiating play.
When the Commissioner is ready to begin the game the Commissioner simply says, "Customary Tip of the Hat," after which everyone repeats "Customary Tip of the Hat" and tips their (imaginary) hats. Another variation is "Hats off," after which all players remove imaginary hats and place them in the center of the circle.
Then, the Commissioner may take the "Customary Shroop," Schwoop, Shroom, or Sloop after which everyone repeats "Customary Shroop" "Customary Schwoop", "Customary Shroom", or "Customary Sloop" and takes an imaginary drink from an imaginary, or real if circumstance permits, drinking vessel. Beverages and snacks can exist within the circle; this helps keep games going for hours.
The Commissioner can then add any more customary phrases she/he desires, and the group should repeat them as appropriate. When the Commissioner feels enough customary phrases have been spoken, the Commissioner Fwaps or Zooms the ball to someone, beginning the Sacred Silent Football motion.
Additionally, the words "The rules are in effect, the ball is now in play" or "Let's play ball" or "The universe is now a closed entity, free speech is now revoked" may be said before the ball is moved.
Tattling.
In many forms of Silent Football, the commissioner cannot accuse anyone of an infraction; therefore it is left to the players to inform the commissioner when an error has been made. If a player notices any other player (including the commissioner) break one of the rules of Silent Football, that player may raise his hand to inform The Commissioner of the rule breaking. The commonly accepted procedure for tattling follows:
In some circles a player who wishes to tattle, but is ignored by the Dictator, may break the rule of silence and exclaim "abuh" to attract the Dictator's attention. If the Dictator continues to ignore the player they may progress to "abuh awuh" followed by "abuh awuh aduh" and penultimately "abuh awuh a-motherfucking-duh." While the Dictator is still not required to call on the player, abuse of this system is punishable and each step up the chain should indicate a more severe infraction has taken place.
Restrictions.
The fundamental rule of Silent Football is *One may never use any pronouns. (In some variations, pronouns referring to oneself are legal, but not in other variations
During tattling (the only socially acceptable time to speak),
Hallucinations.
The game is limited to the people playing in the circle. If a player reacts to a person or thing outside of the circle, he or she is said to be reacting to hallucinations which are the result of hallucinogens and will be awarded penance points. An exception to this rule is that if a hallucination enters the circle they may materialize, and players may ask Mr. Dictator to have something done about the intruders (commonly lick and or tackle said hallucination).
Peanut Gallery.
Any entities not in the game are hallucinations, and thus are referred to out of game as the Peanut Gallery, also known as Poltergeists and Savages and Outside forces. It must be remembered that the Peanut Gallery formally does not exist; it is informal to refer to the peanut gallery in game play and penance points may be issued for such hallucinations. The Peanut Gallery can (and very likely will, given the chance) interfere with the players in whatever ways they wish.
Random Flailing motions.
Random flailing motions are always allowed in the universe of silent football (IE: Flailing the arms trying to get particularly annoying hallucinations to go away).
Miss Cleo.
The Commissioner is allowed the ability to change names; changing one's name to "Miss Cleo" or "Translator" gives him/her the ability to perceive the hallucinations without receipt of penance.
In some circles, the Commissioner is simply immune to all attempts of the peanut gallery/poltergeists, and can interact with the outside world as s/he pleases.
Holy Jihad.
At points within a game, many players may be bothered by the acts of the Peanut Gallery. In this case, a player denoted "Miss Cleo" (or the Commissioner in circles where there is no concept of a "Miss Cleo" player) has the unique ability to incite Holy Jihad (otherwise known as a "witch hunt" or an "exorcism"), an action in which the Peanut Gallery suddenly materializes within the game, and therefore can be tackled, beaten, or otherwise punished for clearly having been distracting before they existed formally. This action is particularly justified if such hallucinations have blocked players' sight of each other's knees, a necessity for fwappage. In the case of a universe playing without the rule of "Miss Cleo", any player may request to the dictator if a holy jihad may be proclaimed on a certain very annoying communal hallucination. The dictator will then grant or deny the request.
Losing.
Once one has attained a set amount penance points (usually between 5 and 10) one has lost. The loser must perform an embarrassing action decided by the winners. However, this cannot involve unwilling third parties. For instance, a penance which involved a sexual encounter would require the consent of the others involved in the penance. However, most penance is generally mildly annoying rather than harsh (One famous penance is the losing player must eat their next meal(s) with only a spoon and no other utensils.) Another example of a punishment is being forced to say Babe after every sentence.
Silence and "woops".
The Quiet Game aspect prohibits any player from making any noise including laughter, talking, movement, chewing, slurping, etc. Only the commissioner may speak. The only sounds allowed and encouraged are bodily functions including the cough, sneeze, burp, and fart. However each of these sounds must be covered by a high pitched "Whoop." For instance, should a player cough twice, he must follow the noise with two whoops, three sneezes would result in three whoops, and so on. Even Silent-But-Deadly bodily functions MUST be followed by a quiet "Whoop" in order to warn the other players.
Goldberg parachute.
An optional corollary measure in instances when a losing player is to perform a penance is known as the Goldberg Parachute. Should a player find that a particular penance is too harsh, they may exercise an option for an alternative penance to be conceived in place of the questionable act. The intent is to remove the possibility of personal psychological upset from a player's participation.
In certain Northern Californian circles, this is alternately known as a Beth, though this term carries a negative context as it implies that the player wishes to play the game without any risk of penance, whether harsh or agreeable. A player who leaves the game without permission to do so following the assignment of penance is certainly and irrefutably a Beth.
Rule variations.
Commissioner.
In some circles, rather than having a "Brother Dictator" there is instead:
Hallucinations.
A custom that has been set in the SAYF community is that whenever people outside of the game intrude with rude intent, the patrons of the game cover their head with their arms, and shout, "Dirty savages!" (variations) and/or hiss.
The custom of one of the Georgia circles is that whenever people outside of the game intrude for any purpose, the patrons of the game cover their head with their arms and remain silent until said disturbance leaves. The commissioner, in extreme circumstances, can break this custom and interact with the disturbance to solve any issues.
Tattling.
Some silent football communities don’t have a strict "no pronoun" rule and instead adhere to the following: 
When speaking, no player may use pronouns such as "he" "she" "it" "they" "we" "us" "you" "him" "her" "hers" "his" etcetera, except for first person singular pronouns, "I" "me" "my" "myself" and "mine," and words which are not always pronouns, such as the demonstrative pronouns "this" "that" and "those."
And some silent football communities have a different variation on the "no pronoun" rule as well; if one wishes to use a pronoun instead of another player's name then they must say "quote" pronoun "unquote".

Summer Paralympic Games

The Summer Paralympic Games or the Games of the Paralympiad, are an international multi-sport event, where athletes with physical disabilities compete. This includes athletes with mobility disabilities, amputations, blindness, and Cerebral Palsy. The Paralympic Games are held every four years, organized by the International Paralympic Committee. Medals are awarded in each event, with gold medals for first place, silver for second and bronze for third, a tradition that the Olympic Games started in 1904.
The United States and The United Kingdom have hosted two Summer Paralympic Games each, more than any other nation. Other countries that have hosted the summer Olympics are Australia, Canada, China, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain and West Germany. In the 2016 Summer Paralympics, Rio de Janeiro will host the first Summer Games in South America. No cities have hosted two Summer Paralympic Games. 
Twelve countries — Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland, United States — have been represented at all Summer Paralympic Games. Seven of those countries have won at least one gold medal at every Summer Paralympic Games: Australia, Austria, France, Great Britain, Italy, Netherlands, and the United States.
The United States have been the top-ranking nation for eight of the 13 Paralympic Summer Games: 1964, 1968, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996. China have been the top-ranking nation for the three most recent Games, 2004, 2008 and 2012. Italy (1960), West Germany (1972) and Australia (2000) have been the top-ranking nation one time each.
Qualification.
Qualification rules for each of the Paralympic sports are set by the International Federation (IF) that governs that sport's international competition.
History.
The first official Paralympic Games, was held in Rome in 1960. 400 athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games though only athletes in wheelchairs competed.
At the 1976 Summer Games athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a summer Paralympics. With the inclusion of more disability classifications, the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries.
The 1988 Summer Paralympics were the first to use the same facilities as the Olympics of that year.
London, United Kingdom held the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil will be the host city of the 2016 Summer Paralympics, becoming the first Latin American and South American city to host either the Summer or Winter Games.
Classification.
Within the six disability categories the athletes still need to be divided according to their level of impairment. The classification systems differ from sport to sport, and is intended to even the playing field so as to allow as many athletes to participate as possible. Classifications vary in accordance with the different skills required to perform the sport.
Archery:
Archery is open to athletes with a physical disability. Classifications are broken up into three divisions: W1, spinal cord injured and Cerebral Palsy athletes with impairment in all four limbs. W2, wheelchair users with full arm function. W3, standing amputee, "Les Autres" and Cerebral Palsy standing athletes. Some athletes in the standing group will sit on a high stool for support but will still have their feet touching the ground.
Athletics:
Athletics is open to all disability groups and uses a functional classification system. A brief classification guide is as follows: prefixing F for field athletes or T for track athletes. F or T 11–13 are visually impaired, F or T 20 are learning disabled, F or T 32–38 are Cerebral Palsy, F or T 40–46 amputee and "Les Autres", T 51–54 wheelchair track athletes and F 51–58 wheelchair field athletes.
Basketball:
Basketball is open to wheelchair athletes. Wheelchair athletes are classified according to their physical ability and are given a points rating between 0.5 – 4.5. The individuals who rate at 0.5 are the most severely disabled and those at 4.5 are the least disabled. A team on the court comprises five players and may not exceed a total of 14 points at any given time.
Boccia:
Boccia is open to athletes with cerebral palsy or related neurological conditions who compete from a wheelchair. Classifications are split into four groups; BC1: Athletes are either throwers or foot players (with Cerebral Palsy). Athletes may compete with an assistant 
BC2: For throwing players (with Cerebral Palsy). Players may not have an assistant
BC3: Athletes (with severe disability) who use an assistive device and may be assisted by a person, but this assistant must keep their back to the court.
BC4: For throwing players. Players may not have an assistant (non Cerebral Palsy).
Cycling:
Cycling is open to amputee, "Les Autre", Cerebral Palsy and visually impaired athletes who compete in individual road race and track events. Classifications are broken up into divisions 2, 3 and 4. Athletes in division two are the most severely disabled. While athletes in division four are considered to be higher functioning. Visually impaired athletes compete together with no separate classification system. They ride in tandem with a sighted guide. Amputee, spinal cord injury and "Les Autre" competitors compete within the classification groupings LC1 – for riders with upper limb disabilities, LC2 – for riders with disabilities in one leg but who are able to pedal normally, LC3 – essentially for riders with a handicap in one lower limb who will usually pedal with one leg only, and LC4 for riders with disabilities affecting both legs.
Equestrian:
Equestrian is open to all disability groups, with riders divided into four grades. Grade 1 incorporates severely disabled riders with Cerebral Palsy, "Les Autres" and spinal cord injury. Grade 2 incorporates Cerebral Palsy, "Les Autres", spinal cord injury and amputee riders with reasonable balance and abdominal control. Grade 3 is for Cerebral Palsy, "Les Autres", amputee, spinal cord injury and totally blind athletes with good balance, leg movement and co-ordination. Grade 4 incorporates athletes who have Cerebral Palsy, "Les Autres", amputation(s), spinal cord injury and/or are visually impaired. This last group comprises ambulant athletes with either impaired vision or impaired arm/leg function.
Fencing:
Fencing is open to wheelchair athletes. There are only three classes; class A incorporates those athletes with good balance and recovery and full trunk movement; class B is for those with poor balance and recovery but full use of one or both upper limbs; class C is for athletes with severe physical impairment in all four limbs.
Football:
There are two forms of football played at the Paralympics. The first is 5-a-side football, which is open to visually impaired athletes. The second is 7-a-side football, which is open to athletes with Cerebral Palsy. 5-a-side football is open to all visually impaired athletes. Since there are different levels of visual impairment, all players except the goalie (who acts as a guide) are required to wear eye shades. The field dimensions are smaller than able-bodied football, there are only five players on the pitch and the ball makes a sound. Otherwise the rules are exactly the same as able-bodied football. Athletes competing in 7-a-side football are broken down into classes 5, 6, 7 and 8. All classes comprise ambulant athletes; class 5 being the least physically able, progressing through to class 8 who are minimally affected. Teams must include at least one athlete from either class 5 or 6. Furthermore no more than three players from class 8 are allowed to play at the same time. Other than the fact that the game is played with seven players the rest of the rules and dimensions of the playing field are the same as able-bodied football.
Goalball:
Goalball is open to visually impaired athletes who must wear "black out" masks to ensure all participants can compete equally, therefore eliminating the need for classification. The ball has a bell in it to help the players react to the ball. Complete silence at the venue is required so that the athletes can orient themselves and to ensure fairness.
Judo:
Judo is open to visually impaired athletes. The rules are the same as able-bodied judo except that the players are allowed contact with their opponent prior to the start of the match. There are no classifications; participants are divided into weight categories in the same way as able-bodied judo athletes.
Powerlifting:
Powerlifting is open to athletes with Cerebral Palsy, spinal cord injuries, amputations (lower limb only), and "Les Autres". Since the competition is a test of upper body strength the classifications are by weight category as in able-bodied powerlifting competition.
Sailing:
Sailing is open to amputee, Cerebral Palsy, visually impaired, spinal cord injured and "Les Autres" athletes. There are three events, one for single, double, and triple-crew boats. Classification for sailing in the three-person event is based on a functional points system with low points for severely disabled athletes rising by scale to high points for less disabled athletes. A classification committee evaluates each sailor and assign a point from one to seven based on their level of ability. Each crew of three is allowed a maximum of 14 points. The single-person event can be crewed regardless of points but the sailor must have at least a minimum level of disability which prevents them from competing on equal terms with able-bodied sailors. The two-person event is designed for more severely disabled athletes.
Shooting:
Shooting is open to athletes with a physical disability. There are only two classes of competition, wheelchair and standing. There are two types of events, pistol and rifle. The athletes are broken down into classes based on their upper body functionality, balance, muscle strength and limb mobility. The three classes are SH1-competitors do not require a shooting stand, SH2-competitors cannot support the weight of the gun and require a shooting stand, and SH3-Rifle competitors with a visual impairment.
Swimming:
The Paralympic swimming competition features all four of the strokes used in able-bodied swimming competitions. Classification is divided into three groups: S1 to S10 are those with physical impairment. S1 will have the most severe impairment and an S10 a lesser impairment. Athletes are judged on their muscle strength, joint range of motion, limb length and movement co-ordination. S11 to S13 are those with a visual impairment. S11 will have little or no vision, S12 can recognise the shape of a hand and have some ability to see, S13 greater vision than the other two classes but less than 20 degrees of vision. S14 is for athletes with a learning difficulty.
Table Tennis:
Table tennis is open to athletes with a physical disability. There are individual, doubles and team events. A match is 5 sets of 11 points each. The athletes are broken down into ten divisions based on their level of function. Classes 1 to 5 are for athletes competing from a wheelchair with class 1 being the most severely disabled and class 5 the least disabled. Classes 6 to 10 encompass ambulant athletes with class 6 the most severely disabled and class 10 the least.
Tennis:
Tennis at the Paralympics is played with all the same rules as able-bodied tennis with the exception that the ball is allowed to bounce twice, and the first bounce must be within the bounds of the court. It is open to athletes with a mobility related disability which means that they cannot compete on equal terms with able-bodied tennis players. The game is played from a wheelchair, with two classes, paraplegic (at least one leg must have a permanent and substantial loss of function) and quadriplegic (at least three limbs must have a permanent and substantial loss of function).
Volleyball:
Volleyball is open to athletes with a physical disability and is performed from a seated position. In sitting volleyball the court is smaller than the standard court and has a lower net. In the sitting games the only classification rule is that each team may have only one player who fits the minimum disability rule, which is that their disability prevents them from competing on equal terms with able-bodied athletes. The other players on the team must demonstrate a higher level of disability.
Wheelchair rugby:
Athletes are classified on a points system similar to wheelchair basketball, with the most severely disabled athlete being graded at 0.5 points rising to 3.5 points. Each team has four players and is allowed a maximum of eight points on the court at any one time.
List of Paralympic sports.
A number of different sports have been part of the Paralympic program at one point or another.

Winter Paralympic Games

The Winter Paralympic Games is an international multi-sport event where athletes with physical disabilities compete. This includes athletes with mobility disabilities, amputations, blindness, and cerebral palsy. The Winter Paralympic Games are held every four years directly following the Winter Olympic Games. The Winter Paralympics are also hosted by the city that hosted the Winter Olympics. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) oversees the Winter Paralympics. Medals are awarded in each event: with gold medals for first place, silver for second and bronze for third, following the tradition that the Olympic Games started in 1904.
The Winter Paralympics began in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. Those Games were the first Paralympics (Summer or Winter) that featured athletes other than wheelchair athletes. The Games have expanded and grown to be (along with the Summer Games) part of the largest international sporting event after the Olympic Games. Given their expansion the need for a very specific classification system has arisen. This system has also given rise to controversy and opened the door for cheating. Winter Paralympians have also been convicted of steroid use and other forms of cheating unique to Paralympic athletes, which has tainted the integrity of the Games.
History.
The origins of the Winter Paralympics are similar to the Summer Paralympics. Injured soldiers returning from World War II sought sports as an avenue to healing. Organized by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann, sports competitions between British convalescent hospitals began in 1948 and continued until 1960 when a parallel Olympics was held in Rome after the 1960 Summer Olympics. Over 400 wheelchair athletes competed at the 1960 Paralympic Games, which became known as the first Paralympics.
Sepp Zwicknagl, a pioneer of snow sports for disabled athletes, was a double-leg amputee Austrian skier who experimented skiing using prosthetics. His work helped pioneer technological advances for people with disabilities who wished to participate in winter sports. Advances were slow and it was not until 1974 that the first official world ski competition for physically impaired athletes, featuring downhill and a cross-country skiing, was held. The first Winter Paralympics were held in 1976 at Örnsköldsvik, Sweden from February 21–28. Alpine and Nordic skiing for amputees and visually impaired athletes where the main events but ice sledge racing was included as a demonstration event. There were 198 participating athletes from 16 countries, and it was the first time athletes with impairments other than wheelchair athletes were permitted to compete.
Starting in 1988 the Summer Paralympics were held in the same host city as the Summer Olympic Games. This was due to an agreement reached between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The 1992 Winter Paralympics were the first Winter Games to use the same facilities as the Winter Olympics.
Cheating.
Athletes have cheated by over-representing impairment to have a competitive advantage, and the use of performance enhancing drugs. German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids in 2002. He had won two gold medals in the alpine events but was stripped of his medals. One concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of boosting blood pressure, known as autonomic dysreflexia. The increase in blood pressure can improve performance by 15% and is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury. This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly and using high-pressured compression stockings. The injury is painless to the athlete but affects the body and impacts the athlete's blood pressure, as can techniques like allowing the bladder to overfill.
Disability categories.
The IPC has established six disability categories applying to both the Summer and Winter Paralympics. Athletes with one of these physical disabilities are able to compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category.
Classifications.
Within the six disability categories the athletes still need to be divided according to their level of impairment. The classification systems differ from sport to sport. The systems are designed to open up Paralympic sports to as many athletes as possible, who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability. The closest equivalents in able-bodied competitions are age classifications in junior sports, and weight divisions in wrestling, boxing, and weightlifting. Classifications vary in accordance with the different skills required to perform the sport. The biggest challenge in the classification system is how to account for the wide variety and severity of disabilities. As a result there will always be a range of impairment within a classification. What follows is a list of the Winter Paralympic sports and a general description of how they are classified.
Alpine skiing:
There are two events in alpine skiing: slalom and giant slalom. Alpine skiing accommodates athletes with the following physical limitations: spinal injury, Cerebral Palsy, amputation, "Les Autres" and blindness/visual impairment. There are eleven classifications, seven for standing athletes, three for sitting athletes, and three for visually impaired athletes. The divisions are defined by the degree of the athletes' function and the need for assistive equipment (prosthesis, ski poles, etc.). Snowboard Cross is technically now included in this category, though competition will take place with only limited classifications (see below).
Biathlon:
Biathlon is a combination of cross-country skiing with target shooting. It requires physical stamina and accurate shooting. The events are open to athletes with physical disabilities and visual impairments. There are fifteen classes in which athletes will be placed depending on their level of function. Twelve divisions are for athletes with a physical impairment and three divisions are for athletes with a visual impairment. The athletes compete together and their finishing times are entered into a formula with their disability class to determine the athletes' over all finish order. Visually impaired athletes are able to compete through the use of acoustic signals. The signal intensity varies depending upon whether or not the athlete is on target.
Cross-country skiing:
Cross-country skiing, also known as Nordic skiing is open to athletes with Cerebral Palsy, amputations, the need for a wheelchair, visual impairment and intellectual impairment. There are fifteen classifications, three for visually impaired athletes, nine for standing athletes and three for seated athletes. The divisions are determined in a similar fashion to alpine skiing with attention given to the athletes' level of function and need for assistive devices.
Ice Sledge Hockey:
Ice sledge hockey is open only to male competitors with a physical disability in the lower part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allows the puck to go beneath the sledge. They also have two sticks, one with a spike end for pushing and the other with a blade end used to hit the puck. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both upper and lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate impairment in their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good balance and mild impairment in their upper and lower limbs.
Wheelchair curling:
Wheelchair curling is a coed team event for athletes with permanent lower limb disabilities that require them to use a wheelchair in their daily lives. Athletes with Cerebral Palsy or Multiple Sclerosis can also play if they use a wheelchair. Delivery of the stone can be by hand release or the use of a pole. There are no classifications in this event except the requirement that all athletes participating must have need for a wheelchair for daily mobility.
Para-snowboarding:
On 2 May 2012, the International Paralympic Committee officially sanctioned "para-snowboarding" (commonly known as "adaptive snowboarding") as a medal event in the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games under Alpine Skiing. There will be men's and women's standing snowboard-cross competitions. The IPC currently recognizes two broader sport classes, one for competitors with lower-limb impairments and one for those with upper-limb impairments. Visually impaired classes are not currently recognized and the sport's debut in the 2014 Sochi Paralympics will feature events for only athletes with lower-limb impairments, who will be permitted to wear a prosthesis. The events will be run in a time trial format (one rider on course at a time), and results within each broad class calculated "without" factors that adjust raw times based on disability classification (for example, a hypothetical athlete with a single above-knee amputation "will not receive any adjustment" to his or her start-to-finish time, even though the lack of a knee and functional quadriceps in one leg can result in an impairment much greater than a hypothetical athlete with a single below-knee amputation but two functional quadriceps). However, as the sport develops, the classes will be expanded and/or refined in the future.

Millcreek Canyon

Millcreek Canyon is a canyon in the Wasatch Mountains and part of Millcreek Township on the east side of the Salt Lake Valley, USA. It is a popular recreation area both in the summer and in the winter. It was named after all the mills that were once located in the densely forested canyon. It is home to two restaurants and six Boy Scout Day Camps.
Millcreek Canyon is next to Parley's Canyon on the north and Big Cottonwood Canyon on the south. Though perhaps the most accessible canyon to Salt Lake City, its upper reaches are much less visited than neighboring canyons.
Recreation in Millcreek.
Biking.
The upper trails in Millcreek Canyon are open to biking on even-numbered days only.
Hiking.
Millcreek Canyon has a variety of trails for hiking. Difficulty ranges from easy (beginner) to difficult (advanced).
Popular trails include:
Pipeline Trail is popular for kids or beginning hikers. It can be accessed from multiple points (Rattlesnake, Church Fork, Burch Hollow and Elbow Fork Trailheads). The least strenuous access points are Elbow Fork and Burch Hollow. This trail is approximately 6.7 miles in length with an elevation gain of 800 feet. 
Desolation Trail to Salt Lake Overlook (Overlook Trail, Trail 019)-(4.8 miles round trip). Trail is accessed from the Desolation trailhead located just east of Millcreek Inn on the south side of the canyon. This a moderately strenuous hike that leads to a fantastic view of the Salt Lake Valley. The Overlook Trail is also a popular snowshoe trail in winter.
Grandeur Peak (2 miles to saddle, 2 3/4 miles to Grandeur peak; elevation gain-1700 feet to saddle, 2400 feet to peak). Trail leads to Grandeur Peak (elev. 8299) and is accessed from the Church Fork Picnic area. 
Dog Lake/Big Water(3 miles to Dog Lake; elevation gain 1200 feet). Trail is accessed from the Big Water trailhead at the top of Millcreek Canyon. This is a moderately difficult trail that is very popular for hikers and mountain bikers. Trail leads to Dog Lake and can also be accessed from the Mill D trailhead in Big Cottonwood Canyon. 
Alexander Basin(2.2 miles to Alexander Basin Ridge,2.5 miles to Gobblers Knob; elevation gain-2700 feet to ridge, 3100 feet to Gobblers Knob. Accessed from the Alexander Basin trailhead, 8 miles up Millcreek Canyon on the south side of the road. In the summer months Alexander Basin can be filled with wild flowers and has fantastic views of the Millcreek (north) ridgeline and beyond. Gobblers Knob (10,246) can be reached from Alexander Basin. This is a steep and strenuous hike.
Mt. Aire Trail (1.8 miles) Mt. Aire is a peak located at the confluence of Mill Creek Canyon, Mt. Aire Canyon, and Parley's Canyon. Hiking to the summit of Mt. Aire is a steep 1.8 miles with an elevation gain of almost 2,000 feet. The following elevation chart illustrates the trail’s consistently unrelenting slope. 
Access.
The top half Millcreek Canyon is closed from November 1 through June 30 to vehicle traffic. 
A $3.00 fee per vehicle is paid upon leaving Millcreek Canyon. Annual passes are $40.00

Salomon Heine

Salomon Heine (19 October 1767 – 23 December 1844) was a merchant and banker in Hamburg. Heine was born in Hanover. Penniless, he came to Hamburg in 1784 and in the following years acquired sizeable assets. It was common knowledge at the time that he was benefactor and patron to his nephew Heinrich Heine. Because of his wealth – by the time of his death his estate was worth an estimated € 110 million – he was called "Rothschild of Hamburg", in allusion to the Rothschild banking family.
Life.
Heine learned the trade of banking at "Bankhaus Popert" in Hamburg. Subsequently he started his own business as a draft broker, cooperating closely with "Emanuel Anton von Halle". In 1797, together with Marcus Abraham Heckscher (1770-1823), he founded the "Heckscher & Co." merchant bank. In 1818, now being the sole executive director, he changed the company's name to "Bankhaus Salomon Heine". During the following years he rose to becoming one of Hamburg's most successful bankers of the time.
Promoter of poet Heinrich Heine.
Salomon Heine let young Heinrich Heine work and learn at his Hamburg bank "Heckscher & Co." and eventually offered Heinrich a position with the cloth company "Harry Heine & Comp." Heinrich though, who had fallen in love with Salomon's daughter Amalie, devoted himself chiefly to poetry and took very little interest in business. Soon he had to declare bankruptcy. Salomon Heine was angered by his nephew choosing poetry as a way of life, in which he himself saw no money. His disapproval became apparent in the dictum: ""Hätt er gelernt was Rechtes, müsst er nicht schreiben Bücher" (Had he learned something proper he needed not write books)." Nonetheless, Salomon paid for Heinrich's studies in Jurisprudence and until his death he regularly granted Heinrich financial aid.
Benefactor of Hamburg.
Salomon Heine's bounty and his position as benefactor are traded by an anecdote: emissaries from a religious order who intended to build a hospital were asking wealthy Hamburg residents for donations. The order was then told to first contact the Jewish banker Heine, the people would donate the same amount as Heine plus one additional Thaler. The friars told Heine of the merchants' reaction and he let them name the price of the hospital's construction. Heine paid exactly one half, so the other businessmen, bound by their words, were obliged to finance the rest.
Moreover, Heine worked in Hamburg for the rest of his life. After the disastrous great fire of Hamburg in 1842 he participated in the city's reconstruction with his private assets. Additionally, he founded the Israelite Hospital of Hamburg in remembrance of his wife Betty who had died in 1837. Heinrich Heine lauded his uncle's foundation in the form of a poem, ""Das neue israelitische Hospital zu Hamburg"", which was published in the volume ""Neue Gedichte"". 
What Heine as a personality meant for Hamburg was most clearly shown though at his funeral. It turned into a demonstration of connecting popularity: thousands of people, Jews as well as Christians, spontaneously accompanied Heine on his last journey to the Ottensen Jewish cemetery.

Ksenia Semenova

Ksenia Andreyevna Semenovaalso Semyonova, (born October 20, 1992) is a Russian artistic gymnast. She is the 2007 World Champion on the uneven bars, and the 2008 European Champion on the uneven bars and the balance beam. She was a member of the silver-medal-winning Russian team at the 2008 European Championships. Semenova is the 2009 European All-Around Champion.
2007.
Semenova broke onto the international scene at the WOGA classic in January, where she placed first on uneven bars and balance beam. She continued her success as part of the Russian team at the Gymnix International in Montreal, scoring an exceptional 15.95 on uneven bars, blowing away the rest of the field with her world leading start value of 7.2. She also won balance beam with an exceptional 15.85 and placed 3rd in floor exercise. In March at the Russian National Championships, she helped the Central region to victory in the team competition, won the uneven bars with 15.975 and took 3rd on beam. Semenova was unable to compete at the European championships in April but returned to win the uneven bars competition at the Russian Cup in July. Her main competition of the year came at the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in September, where she succeeded in becoming world champion on the uneven bars, scoring 16.35 over Nastia Liukin and Yang Yilin, making her the first Russian world champion in gymnastics since her idol Svetlana Khorkina.
2008.
Semenova's first major meet came in April with the European championships, where she helped Russia take silver in the team competition and secured gold in both the uneven bars and the balance beam, with scores of 15.9 and 15.95 respectively. In May she competed at the Moscow Stars World Cup, where she won another gold on the bars, scoring 16.075. Her success continued in June when she finished 2nd at the Dutch Open, behind Anna Pavlova, the two of them leading an all Russian sweep of places 1 to 6. Semenova had problems during the Russian Cup in July, where she fell on beam in qualifications and on vault in the all around final, but she still managed to take silver behind her teammate Afanasyeva.
Aged just 15, Semenova represented Russia at the 2008 Summer Olympics and placed 4th in the all-around, just out of medal contention but surpassing all expectations. Semenova's team was considered to be one of the top four competitive teams (along with China, the USA, and Romania), but narrowly missed an opportunity to medal in Beijing, trailing the third place Romanian team by less than a full point. Semenova also placed 6th in the uneven bars competition. In the team preliminaries, she placed 8th overall on balance beam; her excellent scores almost qualified her to compete in the balance beam finals. However, only two athletes from each country may compete in the event finals. Her teammates Anna Pavlova and Ksenia Afanasyeva qualified in sixth and seventh place, edging her out of the competition. Semenova and Afanasyeva both earned a score of 15.775, but the tie-breaking rules gave the advantage to Afanasyeva. Semenova competed in the uneven bars finals, placing a respectable 6th, but was left behind the front runners Nastia Liukin, Yang Yilin, He Kexin and Beth Tweddle because of a deficit in start value, which Semenova had little time to upgrade due to her determination to excel in the all around competition. Semenova ended the season with a wrist injury that prevented her from competing at the World Cup finals in Madrid.
2009.
Semenova started her season at the Russian National Championships, where she placed second in the all around to outstanding junior Aliya Mustafina. She won the uneven bars and floor exercise to book her place on the European championships squad. Semenova placed first in the all-around competition at the 2009 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Milan, Italy, just ahead of her teammate Afanasyeva. In the event finals, she was second on the uneven bars behind Beth Tweddle of the United Kingdom and third on floor, behind Tweddle and the 2006 World Champion, the Italian Vanessa Ferrari. Semenova also qualified for the balance beam final and finished in fifth place with an uncharacteriscically shaky routine. In July she suffered a minor injury to her wrist, keeping her out of the Russian Cup, but was confirmed to the Russian team for the world championships in October along with Yekaterina Kurbatova, Anna Myzdrikova and Ksenia Afanasyeva, who eventually withdrew due to an injury. After a qualifying round marred by wobbles and a fall on her floor routine, she was 10th going into the all-around but failed to make any event finals. Another fall from the uneven bars during the first rotation prevented her from a better placement and she finished 13th overall.
2010.
The season was marred by injuries for Semenova, who had to sit out the earlier competitions to rest a painful back injury. Nevertheless, she competed at the European Championships in Brussels on floor and beam and qualified for the floor final, from which she eventually gave up her spot to let her teammate Anna Myzdrikova (who went on to win the silver medal) compete. She also contributed to Russia's win in the team final. Semenova was selected to compete at the World Championships in Rotterdam, again only competing in two events. Whereas her beam routine in the qualifying round was steady and well-executed, she counted two falls in her floor exercise on her opening pass (double layout) and on her double pike. Another steady beam routine helped her team to win Russia's first team World title in history and earned Semenova her second World title.
Retirement.
Another injury forced Semenova out of training after the 2010 World Championship. She has never given a public statement about ending her career, but it is widely presumed that she has retired. She has been seen in a number of national competitions in Russia, judging and helping to coach the younger girls from her former gym. 
Routines.
As of 2009, Ksenia performs the following routines:
Special skills.
Semenova performs the "Tkatchev to immediate giant full" combination on the uneven bars and may be the first female gymnast to perform it (but the combination Tkatchev to immediate giant was already performed by former gymnasts like Elise Ray in 2000's or Roza Galieva in 1993). This move is usually done by men on the horizontal bar. She also performs a Deltchev salto on uneven bars, now an unusual skill in the women's sport and an uncommon piked double Arabian dismount.
She has a skill on floor named after her, a double spin in back attitude which carries a D rating under the 2009–12 Code of Points.

Metabolic water

Metabolic water refers to water created inside a living organism through their metabolism, by oxidizing energy-containing substances in their food. Metabolism of fat produces about 110 grams of water per 100 grams, protein 41.3 grams, and starch 55.1 g.
Some organisms, especially xerocoles, animals living in the desert, rely exclusively on metabolic water. Migratory birds must rely exclusively on metabolic water production while making non-stop flights. Humans, by contrast, obtain only about 8-10% of their water needs through metabolic water production.
In mammals, the water produced from metabolism of protein roughly equals the amount needed to excrete the urea which is a byproduct of the metabolism of protein. Birds, however, excrete uric acid and can have a net gain of water from the metabolism of protein.

Telephone numbers in Costa Rica

Country Code: +506<br>
International Call Prefix: 00
As of 2010 the government body in charge of allocations is the Superintendencia de Telecomunicaciones SUTEL (In Spanish)
History of Allocations.
Prefix 00 was reserved for international calls, while prefix 9 was assigned to special numbers, such as 9-1-1. Toll-free numbers start with 800 followed by 7 digits while premium-rate numbers start with 900 followed by 7 digits.
Before 1994, all phone numbers in Costa Rica were six digits long. The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, which at that time had the monopoly on telecommunications, introduced a system in which the telephone numbers in every province were assigned a prefix to make them 7 digits long.
This numbering system was effective for some time. However, the boom of mobile phone customers since the introduction of GSM around 2000 and the expansion of metropolitan areas caused a serious shortage of available numbers. Thus many GSM-based customers used numbers starting with 3 and many residents of San Jose province had telephone numbers starting with prefixes other than 2. 
Since March 20, 2008, a renewed numbering system added the prefix 2 for all landlines and 8 for all mobile phone numbers. This system was implemented in order to face the introduction of 1,5 million 3G W-CDMA customers in Q1 2009. The transition to 8-digit numbers was heavily publicized in Costa Rican media. However, the change caused considerable confusion among foreigners. Also, all calls dialed using the old 7-digit version of the phone number are automatically redirected to a voice message with information about the change.
In 2010, after the end of the government monopoly in telecommunications, prefixes 3,4,5,6 and 7 were assigned to private operators.
8-digit numbers are commonly written two ways: "xxxxxxxx" or "xxxx-xxxx"

2008 Rally Finland

The 58th Rally Finland, the ninth rally of the 2008 World Rally Championship season took place between July 31 and August 3, 2008. The event was the first rally held after a six week mid season break. The rally was based in the city of Jyväskylä in the centre of Finland with the special stages held on fast gravel roads in the lake district area of the country. The winner was the reigning world champion Sébastien Loeb, who became only the fourth non Scandinavian driver to win the event in fifty-eight runnings. It was his sixth win of the season and reduced the gap in the championship standings between himself and Finland's Mikko Hirvonen to just one point. Hirvonen finished in second, with Chris Atkinson taking the third podium spot for the Subaru World Rally Team.
Event.
Day one.
The event started with a short superspecial stage on Thursday evening - which was won by Sébastien Loeb - before the first full day of action on Friday. The first stage on Friday demonstrated the competitive nature of the rally, with Loeb and Hirvonen setting identical times, and Jari-Matti Latvala only finishing three seconds behind them. However, Latvala was the first big casualty, hitting a rock on SS3 and damaging the suspension - an accident that put him out for the day and angered his Ford team boss Malcolm Wilson (rally). Meanwhile, Loeb was eking out a narrow advantage by winning every special stage until SS8. Hirvonen was also driving flat out and matched Loeb's time on SS6 and took his first outright stage win on the 7.86 mile test at Urria. At the end of day one, Loeb had built up a useful lead of 14.4 seconds, although Hirvonen had not given up hope. Behind the two leaders saw a three way battle between the two Stobart Ford drivers, Henning Solberg and Gigi Galli, and Loeb's teammate Dani Sordo. These three were covered by only twelve seconds. The two Subaru World Rally Team drivers, Petter Solberg and Chris Atkinson were having their own private battle, just over ninety seconds behind the leader. Suzuki's Per-Gunnar Andersson was in the final points paying position despite suffering a huge spin on SS2. Impressive performances were made by privateers Urmo Aava and Andreas Mikkelsen, with both featuring in the points earlier on day one - Aava was third after SS4 with Mikkelsen in fifth. However they both crashed out near the end of day one - Aava in SS9 and Mikkelsen in SS10.
Day two.
The battle between Loeb and Hirvonen continued throughout day two with the pair regularly setting fastest times. They were opening up a big lead to the drivers behind them, with Hirvonen describing the pace as "crazy...how much longer can this go on for, I don't know." By the end of the day Loeb had pulled out another four seconds to take his lead to eighteen seconds. Most of this time was gained when Hirvonen stalled at the start of SS20.
Behind the leaders, Gigi Galli had been drawing away in the battle for third before an accident in the Kakaristo stage (which was a truncated and reversed version of Ouninpohja) put him out of the rally. After Galli, PG Andersson also rolled at the same corner. The main mover of the day was Subaru driver Chris Atkinson who leapt from seventh to third on the leaderboard by the end of day two. Dani Sordo was only a second behind in fourth but was having to be cautious in order to score manufacturer points. Henning Solberg was slipping back in fifth place while his brother Petter was one place behind in sixth. Privateer driver Matti Rantanen had moved up to seventh due to the retirements of others and Toni Gardemeister was keeping his Suzuki in the points despite having problems with his gearbox.

NZ Transport Agency

The NZ Transport Agency (NZTA; ) is a New Zealand Crown entity tasked with promoting safe and functional transport by land, including the responsibility for driver and vehicle licensing and investigating rail accidents. It was created on 1 August 2008 by the Land Transport Management Amendment Act 2008, merging Transit New Zealand with Land Transport New Zealand. Its legal name, as established by the Act, is New Zealand Transport Agency, but it operates as "NZ Transport Agency". Its Māori name, "Waka Kotahi", means "one vessel" and is intended to convey the concept of "travelling together as one".
The initial Transport Agency board was criticised by the National Party opposition in July 2008 as being "stacked" with New Zealand Labour Party political appointees. However, after the 2008 election, various board members were since appointed or reappointed according to the National government's choices.
Awards.
The Transport Agency has been recognised, alongside its partners, by a range industry and professional bodies for innovation and best practice. Some of the awards received in 2012-13 include:
Public data access.
The Transport Agency stores licensing, registration and Warrant of Fitness details for any road-registered vehicle within New Zealand, including cars, motorbikes, trailers, trucks and earthmoving/agricultural machinery. Any member of the public can query the Transport Agency's database by making a request using the license plate or VIN number at an NZ Post outlet, or by using a vehicle checking website.
Road signage.
Road signs in New Zealand fall under the authority of the Transport Agency and are prescribed in the Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual.

Telebus

A Telebus , Dial-a-bus , or Dial-a-ride service is a bus service that operates in a mode partway between a normal scheduled bus service and a taxi. The academic name for these services is demand responsive transport. Telebuses typically have a scheduled route, but passengers can ring and book a pick-up within an area served by the route, and the bus route is modified to make the pick-up. Drop offs anywhere within the area can also be accommodated. The aim is to extend public transport services to the front door of all residences, or from any place to any place.
Some services operate exclusively for disabled or elderly passengers other services are open to the general public.
The term Paratransit has been used as a term for Telebus service. But possibly because paratransit sounds to the uninitiated like a service for the disabled, other terms such as Telebus have become more popular, particularly for services not primarily intended to service disabled passengers. Often paratransit is used to mean Demand responsive transport that is limited to disabled passengers.
Examples.
The city of Regina in Canada was one of the early pioneers of Telebus services. Their service operated from the early 1970s until the early 1980s. Other cities have since initiated services.
A number of public Telebus services operate in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Australia.
Aberdeen in Scotland operates a citywide service for passengers unable to use normal public transport services.
