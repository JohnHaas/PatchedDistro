Nawab Khwaja Abid Siddiqi

Nawab Khwaja Abid Siddiqi/Kwaja Abid (Qalich Khan title given by Shahjahan) (became Nawab under Aurangzeb and was a Siddiqi by lineage) a loyal general for the Mughal Empire. He is most famous through his grandson Qamar-ud-din Siddiqi, Asaf Jah I, son of Ghazi ud-Din Khan Siddiqi Feroze Jung I.
Birth.
Khwaja Abid Siddiqi born in Adilabad near the ancient Silk Road city of Samarkand. He came from a family of ulemmas (learned men). His father was Khaja Ismael Siddiqi s/o shaikh Allahdad Siddiqi s/o Abdul Rehman Shaikh Azizzan Siddiqi 14 in direct descent from Shaikh Shihab uddin Siddiqi Suhrawardy of Suhrawada in Kurdistan a celebrated Sufi mystic lived in Persia, a renowned scholar known for his piety and knowledge of the law and was even honoured with the title Allum-ul-Ulemma (wisest of the wise).
Through his fathers side of the family Nawab Kwaja Abid Siddiqi could trace his lineage back 34 generations to the first Caliph of Islam Abu Bakr Siddiqi and on his mothers to the Islamic prophet Muhammad himself.
Early life.
Khwaja Abid Siddiqi broke with family tradition and became a fighter rather than a scholar. 
Henry Brigs a historian wrote,
" In youth he was trained to the use of the bow, the spear and the sword. Riding on horseback was familiar to him from the moment he could toddle alone from his mother's knee as it is to this day to everybody from the plains of Arabia to the hills of Afghanistan and he was specially taught to regard the cause of the Crescent and the Koran as the great purpose of his existence"
It was in 1655 that Khwaja Abid Siddiqi undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca. But on his way there he stopped off in India to present himself before Shah Jahan. The Mughal Emperor bestowed on Khwaja Abid a Kilat (dress of honour) and promised him that after he returned from Mecca he could take up a post on his personal staff. Aurangzeb was trained by him. Under his command Aurangzeb conquered central India and south India.
Later life.
He returned from his pilgrimage to India in 1658 to take up his post serving the Emperor Shah Jahan, only to find that the Emperor had been taken ill and so Khwaja Abid decided to throw his lot in with Prince Aurangzeb.
Taking command of one of the Mughal armies, Khwaja Abid played a crucial role in the battlefield of Samugarh. For this he was rewarded by being made one of the Emperors most trusted generals.
He then proceeded to follow Aurangzeb around India as the Emperor pursued his dream of bringing all of Hindustan under the Timuri Flag. Many battles were fought and many Forts besieged but it was when attacking Golconda that Kwaja Abid shone through as the Emperors most loyal and courageous general.
When Aurangzebs army left to attack Golconda, it was under the command of Khwaja Abids son Firuz Jung. Firuz Jung was so keen on taking the fort in a sudden assault, he sent his father in charge of the storming party. However Khwaja was hit by a musket ball, which completely severed his arm. He returned to the Mughal camp on his horse refusing to dismount. Aurangzebs Vazīr-e Azam (prime minister) noticed that while the surgeons were busy taking bits of bone and iron from his wound, he was stoically sipping coffee.
Hyderabadi Biryani is brought by him in Deccan. These family has great taste ot food and living style.
Death.
Khwaja Abid Siddiqi died a few days later, his arm was also found identified by the signet ring he always wore on his finger. Nawab Khwaja Abid Siddiqi is buried in a tomb at Kismatpur near Attapur Himayatsagar only a few Kilometres from where he had died at Golconda. He was Chief Commander of Aurangzeb's Army when Golconda conquered. Having had issue, five sons and two daughters. Nawab Qaziuddin Khan Siddqi, Nawab Khwaja Hamid Khan Siddiqi Bahadur, Nawab Rahim chin qulich Khan Siddiqi Bahadur and two sons died young. Khadija Begum sahiba and another daughter married to Nawab Riyat khan siddiqi Bahadur.

Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Super heavyweight

The super heavyweight class in the boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics competition is the heaviest class. Super heavyweights were limited to those boxers weighing over 91 kilograms (200.6 pounds).
Like all Olympic boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with one minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches by the end of the bout. 
16 boxers qualified for this category after the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships and 9 Continental Qualification Tournaments.

Bezirksliga Rhein

The Bezirksliga Rhein was the highest association football league in the northern part of the German state of Baden and the Bavarian region of Palatinate from 1923 to 1927, when the league was replaced by the "Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar".
Overview.
The league was formed in 1923, after a league reform which was decided upon in Darmstadt, Hesse. It replaced the "Kreisliga Odenwald" and the "Kreisliga Pfalz" as the highest leagues in the region. 
The "Bezirksliga Rhein", named after the river Rhine (German: "Rhein"), started out with eight teams, playing each other in a home-and-away round with the league winner advancing to the Southern German championship, which in turn was a qualification tournament for the German championship. 
The league modus remained unchanged for its first three seasons, 1923–24, 1924–25 and 1925-26. For its last edition however, it expanded to ten clubs. Additionally, the leagues runners-up also qualified for a "consolidation" round with the other runners-up of the southern "Bezirksligas". The winner of this round was awarded the third entry spot for the south to the German finals.
In an attempt to bring all Southern German leagues to a similar system, the "Bezirksligas" were reorganised in 1927. For the "Bezirksliga Rhein", this meant, it joined with the southern clubs of the "Bezirksliga Rheinhessen-Saar" to form the new "Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar". In practice, this meant little change for the league as the new "Bezirksliga" was immediately sub-divided into two independent, regional divisions. Out of the ten clubs in the league, eight went to the new "Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar - Rhein division", only the FK Pirmasens found itself grouped into the "Saar division" of the new league while the SV Darmstadt 98 went to the new "Bezirksliga Main-Hessen".

EA-3167

EA-3167 is a potent and long lasting anticholinergic deliriant drug, related to the chemical warfare agent 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). It was developed under contract to Edgewood Arsenal during the 1960s as part of the US military chemical weapons program, in an attempt to develop non-lethal incapacitating agents. EA-3167 has identical effects to QNB, but is even more potent and longer lasting, with an effective dose when administered by injection of as little as 2.5μg/kg (i.e. 0.2 milligrams for an 80kg person), and a duration of 120-240 hours (5-10 days). However unlike QNB, EA-3167 was never weaponized or manufactured in bulk.

Turkish Armed Forces in Northern Cyprus

The Turkish Armed Forces in Northern Cyprus officially the "Cyprus Turkish Peace Force" (Turkish: "Kıbrıs Türk Barış Kuvvetleri" or "KTBK") is the Turkish military garrison on Cyprus. In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Cyprus following a Greek Cypriot coup (organized and supported by the Greek government, which was still in the hands of a military junta) which wanted to enforce union with Greece, occupying the northern third of the island. The invasion force, which consisted of about 40,000 soldiers and 200 tanks, subsequently was reduced to a garrison of 17,000 troops. It outnumbers the Greek military contingent on the island, which is supplemented by the Greek Cypriot National Guard of 12,000 active and 75,000 reserves. Air reinforcement of the Turkish troops can be effected, if necessary, within hours. Nevertheless, the unresolved dispute over Cyprus complicates Turkish participation in NATO and remains an obstacle to NATO's effectiveness in the region.
History.
Cyprus Turkish Brigade.
Turkey maintains the Cyprus Turkish Brigade ("Kıbrıs Türk Alayı") in the northern part of the Republic of Cyprus. On 16 August 1960, the brigade was organized as follows:
Invasion of Cyprus.
In July 1974, Turkey landed forces on the northern part of Cyprus after the military coup of July 15, 1974. Turkish forces involved in operations were as follows:
Post invasion.
It has been on Cyprus since the Turkish invasion of 1974, and initially consisted of the following Turkish Army units:
The corps reserve was at Kythrea (Değirmenlik) to the northeast of Nicosia.
Strength.
The original force of 40,000 troops was reduced with Turkish authorities claiming that the Turkish force in Cyprus had been reduced to 17,500 in the 1990s. However, according to the UN Secretary-General "“It is estimated that in recent years there have been in the northern part of the island a little under 30,000 armed forces of the Republic of Turkey (Turkish Forces) making it one of the most militarized areas in the world in terms of numbers of troops and numbers of civilian population. Recently moreover there have been indications that the total numbers of Turkish forces on the island may have increased”" S994/680 7.6.1994.par.28.
Turkish forces in Cyprus are part of the Turkish Aegean Army which is headquartered at Izmir in Turkey. However, the commander of the Turkish troops reports directly to the Turkish General Staff in the capital, Ankara. The force is responsible for all security and is not directly involved in political matters of northern Cyprus.
Since 16 August 1974, the Turkish Army has retained control of the northern 37% of Cyprus.
Military Personnel in Northern Cyprus.
It is not possible to give an exactly accurate number of military personnel serving in northern Cyprus, due to conflicting public sources of information.
There are an estimated 30,000 regular troops of the Turkish Army serving in northern Cyprus at any given time are:

Tracy Beaker's Movie of Me

Tracy Beaker: The Movie of Me is a 2004 69 minute feature length film. It is the only Tracy Beaker episode television movie and aired on the BBC.
Background information.
Tracy Beaker is 3 days away from her 13th birthday". She has black frizzy hair and is very mischievous. She also has a short fuse and a wild imagination. This makes it difficult for people to get Tracy to listen. After being abandoned by her mum, Tracy has lived in a care home kid for several years. Although Tracy can come across is being mean and spiteful, she does have a loveable and caring nature. At one point in the film, she states that she was scared when she was in the care home and so she became angry at the careworkers.
Then Tracy meets Cam Lawson - a single woman and very unpromising mother material - and makes her fall in love with her indomitable attitude. Tracy imagines the world in her fantasies but her real mum (Carly) cannot come to visit her in the care home that she has christened `The Dumping Ground` because of her glamorous career as a Hollywood actress. This dream has been her comfort blanket and even when Cam offers to love her, she can't quite let it go. So what happens when fantasy becomes reality... and her Mum (Ruth Gemmell) turns up to claim her.
Cam eventually fosters Tracy but not everything goes as planned. Cam takes Tracy back to the care home. Tracy's mum turns up and takes her out. They become close but then Tracy's mum finds out Cam used to be Tracy's foster mum and feels hurt and drives away in a taxi. Tracy decides to look for her along with Crash who travels to Hopesten. They find her filming a scene on a film set, although Carly reveals that she is a stunt double and not an actress. Tracy's mum tells her to wait at her hotel but lets her down again. Cam and Tracy go to the nightclub where Carly is. Carly tells Tracy that she is moving to Hollywood to pursue her work and that she will come to collect Tracy in due course. Tracy asks Carly if Cam can foster her. She hands over Tracy and tells Cam to keep care of her. Then Keisha White performs "Someday". This is also the first time you get a hint that Crash and Tracy are becoming more than just friends.
During the end credits, Hayley meets Mark and Helen, her future foster parents whom she meets for the first time.

List of actors considered for the James Bond character

This is a list of actors who were considered for the role of James Bond, both officially (auditioned by the film producers) and unofficially (supported by fans and celebrities) considered for the role of agent 007.
Declined the role.
A number of actors who have come under consideration for the role of James Bond have declined the offer for various reasons.
Both Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan were linked to the role at least a decade before taking it but declined for various reasons.
Dalton was offered the role in 1967 at the age of 21 and finally took the role 20 years later. Dalton denied the offer again in 1979 because he felt the plot directions of the Bond films were becoming less realistic and more dependent on gadgetry and repeated plot formulas.
Both Roger Moore and Dalton also did not accept the role for "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", feeling that they did not want to be viewed as the man who replaced Sean Connery. Pierce Brosnan was chosen as Bond for "The Living Daylights", but had to leave the role because the show "Remington Steele" had been renewed, as Brosnan played the lead role. The role then went to Dalton. Brosnan made his debut as Bond in "GoldenEye".
Screen tests.
Some actors have filmed screen tests using the bedroom scene in "From Russia with Love" (1963). Although not picked, their screen tests show some insights into how they would have portrayed Bond. Of the three, only Pierce Brosnan was eventually cast as Bond, eight years after testing. 
In Bond films.
The following actors were considered for the role of James Bond, but were cast supporting or opposing characters.
Colin Salmon was also rumoured to be one of many actors to replace Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, a role that would go to Daniel Craig. Had he been chosen for the role, Salmon would have been the first black Bond. Brosnan has backed Salmon as a possible successor to Craig.

Sidney Weighell

Sidney Weighell (31 March 1922 – 13 February 2002) (pronounce surname as "weal") was a British footballer, trade unionist and the General Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen from 1975 to 1983.
Early life.
He was born at 25 Gladstone Street Northallerton, Yorkshire in 1922 into a "Railway Family" (his father, Tom Weighell was a Signalman, his grandfather Bill was a guard and his brother Maurice was a driver). He was educated at a Church of England school, which he left at 15 and became an apprentice mechanic. 
Railway work.
In 1938 he took an apprenticeship at the road motor engineering department of the London and North Eastern Railway company. He became active in the NUR immediately upon starting work for the Railways, believing in 'one union for all railway staff'. This brought him into conflict with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF); Weighell was a so-called 'footplate grade', traditionally represented by ASLEF, not the NUR. Weighell considered craft unions (unions catering to a particular job within an industry rather than to the industry itself) as outmoded and elitist, and apparently said so on many occasions at the Northallerton Railwaymen's club. 
In January 1940 he joined the locomotive department as a fireman, becoming a qualified engine driver in 1943. He left the railways in 1945 to become a professional footballer, but returned in 1947. In 1954 he was made a full-time divisional officer for the NUR, and moved to their headquarters in London. In 1965 he was elected Assistant General Secretary of the NUR, and his maiden speech at the Labour Party conference in 1966 was heavily critical of Frank Cousins' policies on income and pay restraint, further cementing his reputation as a "disruptive influence".
In 1969 he was named as Senior AGS, becoming Sidney Greene's deputy when the need arose, and when Greene chose to retire in 1975 Weighell won the leadership election, with more votes than all three of his opponents put together, a rare occurrence in the NUR.
Following rumours of a massive cut in rail services he threatened to stop NUR-sponsored MPs from backing any kind of bill. He spoke at the 1976 Labour Party Conference, along with Johnny Johnson and Ray Buckton, talking about the deep disappointment following the party's desertion of its election manifesto.
During the 1960s he waged a campaign against the conversion of the railway engines to diesel fuel, arguing that the best conversion in the long-term would be to electrical power. He failed to convince either the National Executive or Harold Wilson, but made more progress in the 1970s with his new leverage as General Secretary, attacking Anthony Crosland's White Paper on transport integration. A stroke of luck saw Crosland moved to the foreign office in 1976 and replaced by William Rodgers, who was more receptive to comments from the NUR. The result was the Transport Act 1978, which Weighell saw as a victory.
Politics.
In 1945 he joined the Labour Party, becoming a member of the local trades council, and was elected to the National Executive Committee in 1953. He was initially regarded as a disruptive influence, and fired from the trades council for introducing politics into the proceedings. 
Downfall.
At the Labour Party conference in 1982, the NUR delegation decided to vote for the National Union of Mineworkers, led by Arthur Scargill. Weighell, however, secretly voted for the EETPU, a fact quickly discovered by conference officials.
Branded a cheat, Weighell was forced to offer his resignation, which a union conference convened in Birmingham accepted 41–36. Despite the scandal he maintained he had done the right thing, saying "I'm glad to have been a casualty if it means that the party executive does not fall into the hands of militants."
Later life.
After resigning in 1983 he moved back to Yorkshire and joined the British Airports' Authority board, as well as acting as a consultant to Tyne Tees Television. In 1983 he wrote an autobiography titled "On the Rails" which was extremely scathing to both the successive and earlier General Secretaries.
Personal life.
On 1 September 1949 Weighell married Margaret Hunter, with whom he had one son and one daughter, Jennifer and Anthony. In 1956 Margaret and Jennifer were both killed when the family were involved in a car crash. Sidney himself spent several months in hospital, but returned to work after he had recovered. He married a second time on 21 November 1959 to Joan Willetts, a market research interviewer, but no children resulted.
Football.
Weighell was a skilled footballer, and always attributed his failure of the 11-plus exams to his preference to play football rather than study. He was offered trials for Sunderland, Newcastle United and Sheffield United, and signed for Sunderland on 12 October 1945 for a fee of £10 and played for 2 seasons as an inside-left on the second team, claiming that he was the best inside-left in the north east "except for a certain gentleman by the name of Raich Carter".

Emery Hawkins

Emery Hawkins (April 30, 1912 – June 1989) was an American animator who worked at various studios such as Disney, Screen Gems, Walter Lantz, Warner Bros., and UPA during the golden age of animation. His most prominent work is the Woody Woodpecker cartoons from the 1940s. Along with Art Heinemann, Hawkins helped redesign Woody and made him more streamlined. He also worked with Art Babbitt and Ken Harris on Richard Williams's unfinished animated feature The Thief and the Cobbler. Hawkins was known for the speed in which he animated, completing scenes quickly, but with perfection. Hawkins (along with Babbitt, Harris and Grim Natwick) is frequently mentioned in Richard Williams' book "The Animator's Survival Kit".
Hawkins developed Alzheimer's Disease in his later years and was forced to retire. He died in 1989 at the age of 77.

Balatonring was to be a 4.650 km long motor racing circuit, located in Sávoly, Hungary near Central and South Europe's biggest lake Balaton. The circuit is located about 180 km away from Budapest, the capital city of Hungary. Spain's Balatonring Zrt was to operate the racing circuit with 70% share owned by Worldwide Circuit Management S.L. (WCM) and Magyar Turizmus Zrt. (Hungarian Tourism Board) owning 30%. Spanish investment group Sedesa will be the constructor at a cost of €80 million and seating for 110,000 to 140,000 will be constructed.
Construction work on the 200 million Euro project had started on 6 November 2008, and the facility was due to host its first MotoGP race on 20 September 2009. However, on 11 March 2009, motogpmatters.com reported that the Hungarian round would be canceled due to problems related to the Financial crisis of 2007–2010. The circuit would not be completed in time for the September 20th race. The first Hungarian GP was scheduled to take place in September 2010.
On 18 March 2010 the Hungarian GP was cancelled as the FIM said the construction work that needed to be done will not be done in time for the event. It was replaced by the Motorland Aragon.
As of November 2012, the plot has been on auction for a month. The project has accumulated a total debt of HUF 3.5 bn (USD 16,000,000) and the plot is being sold for HUF 1.5 bn (USD 6,800,000). Nothing can be seen from the track line as weeds have grown over it.

Freedom from discrimination

The right to freedom from discrimination is internationally recognised as a human right and enshrines the principle of egalitarianism. The right to freedom from discrimination is recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and enshrined in international human rights law through its inclusion in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
The right to freedom from discrimination is particularly relevant for groups that have been historically discriminated against and "vulnerable" groups. In this respect, the right to freedom from discrimination has been elaborated upon in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Human Rights.
The concept of the right to freedom from discrimination is to the concept of human rights, as human rights are the rights of all humans. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948, starts with the words "Whereas recognition is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world."
Article 1 of the UDHR states:
"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."
Article 2 of the UDHR states:
"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty."

475th Air Base Wing

The 475th Air Base Wing (475th ABW) is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last duty station was at Yokota Air Base, Japan, where it was inactivated on 1 April 1992.
A non-flying wing, 475th ABW's mission at Yokota was to perform host unit missions. The wing had no numbered flying squadrons, although it did operate a few T-39 Sabreliner aircraft and UH-1 Huey helicopters. It was absorbed by the 374th Airlift Wing under the "one base-one wing" organizational concept.
History.
The 475th Fighter Wing was activated in 1948 as part of the "Base-Wing" USAF reorganization, assigned to the 315th Air Division of Far East Air Forces where it performed postwar occupation duty. The wing was one of several occupation units in Japan, and was inactivated on 1 April 1949 at Ashiya Airfield due to budget reductions.
Cold War.
In January 1968, the 475th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated at Misawa AB, Japan, replacing the 39th Air Division as the host unit, with the 439th Combat Support Group (Provisional) being redesignated 475th Combat Support Group that controlled the base support units. At Misawa, the wing trained for offensive and reconnaissance operations. Initial assigned operational squadrons of the wing were:
The 45th TRS and 612th TFS were unmanned during their entire assignment, as squadron was on deployed status to bases in South Vietnam (The 45th TRS deployed to Tan Son Nhut Air Base; the 612th TFS at Phu Cat Air Base).
From Misawa, aircraft and personnel of the 67th, 356th and 391st TFS rotated six aircraft every ten days to Kusan and Taegu Air Bases in South Korea performing Nuclear alert duty. A massive earthquake on 16 May 1968 caused over $1 million worth of damage to Misawa AB. Air Force fighter operations ceased at Misawa in early 1971, and the wing phased down operations. All flying resources were reassigned to Kusan AB South Korea for the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, and the wing was inactivated on 15 March, being replaced by the provisional 6112th Air Base Group as Misawa was phased down for reconstruction.
After a brief period of inactivation, the 475th Air Base Wing was reactivated on 1 November 1971 at Yokota Air Base, Japan, replacing the provisional 6100th Air Base Wing. At Yokota, the wing inherited a huge support complex, with some 47 sub-locations in all parts of Japan, including operation of Yokota and Tachikawa Air Bases, Fuchu and Chitose Air Stations, and numerous housing complexes within the Tokyo area. In 1972 the wing's components were as below:
At Yokota, the only operational flying squadron was the 556th Reconnaissance Squadron (formerly assigned to the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing at Yokota from 1968). The 556th RS was a highly specialized unit, employing modified C-130B-II, EB-57E electronic counter measures (ECM) aircraft and on occasion TDY C-130A-II and EC-97G Stratotankers. Only the EB-57E's carried the tail code GT, the C-130B-IIs and other aircraft being uncoded.
Post Vietnam era.
The 55th RS was inactivated on 30 June 1972, after which the 475th supported a Royal Thai Air Force C-123 Provider detachment which provided airlift support to the United Nations Command (Rear) of Fifth Air Force, which relocated its headquarters to Yokota in November 1974.
The 475th ABW also gradually closed down many of its widely dispersed installations, sites and facilities, consolidating them as well as assisting in the closing of Tachikawa Air Base in September 1977. On 1 October 1978, Military Airlift Command (MAC) established the 316th Tactical Airlift Group (Provisional) at Yokota, being supported by the 475th ABW. This was MAC's operational support airlift group in the Far East, with the 1403d Military Airlift Squadron (Provisional) flying a combination of CT-39As, C-12Fs, and C-21As which it obtained from various bases in PACAF, consolidating them at Yokota. On 1 October 1989, this unit was upgraded to a wing level and personnel redesignated as the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing, which was moved from Clark AB, Philippines in a name-only redesignation.
The 475th ABW was inactivated on 1 April 1992 as part of a consolidation effort, being replaced as host unit at Yokota by the 374th, which was redesignated 374th Airlift Wing same date.

Rachel Hoffman

Rachel Morningstar Hoffman (December 17, 1984 – May 7, 2008) was a 23-year-old Florida State University graduate. She was murdered while acting as a police informant during a botched drug sting that started on May 7, 2008. Her body was recovered two days later near Perry, Florida.
She was under drug court supervision for possession of 25 grams (0.9 oz.) of marijuana during a traffic stop on February 22, 2007. On April 17, 2008, a search of her apartment by Tallahassee, Florida police uncovered 151.7 grams (or 5.328 ounces) of cannabis, and 4 ecstasy pills. Faced with a possible prison sentence if charged and convicted, police attempted to get her to identify other marijuana dealers to avoid the charges. She refused. The police then pressured her to act as a confidential informant in a drug sting operation instead, in exchange for not being charged with additional drug charges. The intended goal of the operation was to buy 1,500 ecstasy pills, 2 ounces of cocaine, and a handgun (which was contrary to department policy as it opened the opportunity for the suspected criminals to explain the presence of the gun), using $13,000 cash in a buy-bust operation and all three buys were very out of character for Rachel, her family stated. She did not know the two men she was to meet, but was eager to cooperate with the police operation and made suggestions of her own on how the operation should be conducted. Two narcotics officers arranged for the drug buy at a specific location and were providing security for the buy. This was later deemed to be insufficient manpower to protect the informant and still apprehend the suspects. 
While she was at the drug buy, with the policemen monitoring, the two suspects changed the location of the buy. Her handlers lost track of her when she agreed with the change in plans and left the buy spot with the two suspects in their car, a stolen silver BMW. While in transit, the two suspects allegedly executed her with the same gun she was supposed to buy. 
According to police documents, a witness described seeing the BMW stuck in a ditch, with a 2005 Volvo belonging to Hoffman idling nearby, between 7 pm and 7:30 pm, about 30 minutes after the police lost track of Hoffman. The witness claimed that the Volvo drove off when he stopped to help the BMW driver try to get the car out of the ditch, but the Volvo later returned as the witness was leaving. The witness claimed he became suspicious and decided to leave when the driver of the BMW opened the trunk and revealed a camouflage blanket and neat stacks of female clothing. 
Deneilo R. Bradshaw, 23, and Andrea Jabbar Green, 25, who were fired from their jobs at a window tint and car detailing shop just days before the incident, were charged with armed robbery in connection with the events leading up to Hoffman's death. Additional charges are pending. 
The Tallahassee Police Department admitted that Hoffman had no training to work undercover, she did not know the two men targeted in the sting, and she had no experience with cocaine or firearms and very little with MDMA. The officers involved in the operation were suspended with pay, and the family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city.
The two buyers have been charged by a grand jury with first degree murder. Details of the murder itself have not been released, but are expected to be revealed under testimony during the court proceedings.
Rachel Hoffman's story has garnered many news headlines including a page on the Tallahassee Democrat website dedicated to information surrounding her death.
"20/20" covered this story on July 25, 2008.
"Dateline NBC" covered this story on Friday, January 16, 2009, at 10:00 PM, 9 Central time, and is expected to re-play the piece on its sister networks.
On December 17, 2009 which would have been Rachel Hoffman's 25th birthday, Deneilo Bradshaw, one of the murder suspects, was found guilty of first degree murder with robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole plus 30 years (concurrent). Andrea Greene, was also convicted of Rachel's murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Rachel's Law.
On May 7, 2009, a law (dubbed "Rachel's Law") was passed by the Florida State Senate which brought into effect on July 1, 2009 a number of requirements for law enforcement agencies in Florida regarding the use of police informants. While Rachel's Law became state-wide policy for all police departments, at least one major city department began taking steps towards training on the new policies at least three months sooner than required.
"Rachel's Law" requires law enforcement agencies to (a) provide special training for officers who recruit confidential informants, (b) instruct informants that reduced sentences may not be provided in exchange for their work, and (c) permit informants to request a lawyer if they want one.

2008 Ahmedabad blasts

The 2008 Ahmedabad bombings were a series of 21 bomb blasts that hit Ahmedabad, India, on 26 July 2008, within a span of 70 minutes. 56 people were killed and over 200 people were injured. Ahmedabad is the cultural and commercial heart of Gujarat state, and a large part of western India. The blasts were considered to be of low intensity, and were similar to the Bangalore blasts, Karnataka which occurred the day before.
Several TV channels said they had received an e-mail from a terror outfit called Indian Mujahideen claiming responsibility for the terror attacks; Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, however, has claimed responsibility for the attacks. The Gujarat police arrested the suspected mastermind, Mufti Abu Bashir, along with nine others, in connection to the bombings.
These bombings occurred a day after the Bangalore blasts and a day before a bomb blast in the Indian state of Jharkhand.
The bombings.
The bombs were planted in Tiffin carriers on bicycles, a pattern similar to the 13 May 2008 Jaipur bombings. Many of the blasts targeted the city bus service, ripping apart portions of the vehicles. Two blasts took place inside the premises of two hospitals, about 40 minutes after the initial series of blasts. One of the blasts in the hospitals occurred when injured victims of the initial series of blasts were being admitted there. Another bomb was found and defused on the following day in the Hatkeshwar area. Two live bombs were also retrieved from Maninagar, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's constituency.
Gujarat police recovered and defused two more bombs in Surat, another major city in Gujarat, a day after the Ahmedabad blasts. Two cars filled with materials required to make explosives, including detonators, were also found, one of them parked on a roadside near a hospital, and the other in the outskirts of Surat.
Warning of attacks through e-mail.
Several news agencies reported receiving a 14-page e-mail five minutes before the explosions with the subject line: "Await 5 minutes for the revenge of Gujarat", apparently referring to the 2002 Gujarat violence which took place after the Godhra train burning incident. The e-mail was sent by the group known as Indian Mujahideen on 26 July at around 6:41pm IST.
The contents of the e-mail warned of attacks in 5 minutes: “In the name of Allah the Indian Mujahideen strike again! Do whatever you can, within 5 minutes from now, feel the terror of Death!”
The e-mail also contained threats against the current Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, and his deputy, R.R. Patil, with the claim, “We wonder at your memory. Have you forgotten the evening of 11 July 2006 so quickly and so easily?”
Furthermore, the threats went on to warn Indian businessman Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries to “think-twice” before “usurping and building a citadel on a land in Mumbai that belongs to the Waqf board...lest it turns into horrifying memories for you which you will never ever forget.”
The e-mail also reportedly threatened several Bollywood actors, asking them to stop acting.
Police reported that they questioned U.S national Ken Haywood from whose IP address the threatening email was sent. Haywood's residence in the Sanpada area of Navi Mumbai was raided by ATS officials on 27 July after the IP address from which a threatening email was sent minutes before the Ahmedabad serial blasts was found to be his.
Casualties.
56 people were killed by the bombing and over 200 people were injured.
Initially, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sanctioned an ex gratia payment of Rs 100,000 (US$ 2,300) to the next of kin of the dead. However upon visiting Ahmedabad, he raised the ex gratia figure to Rs 350,000 (US$ 8,050). In addition, he also announced a compensation of Rs 50,000 (US$ 1,200) for those injured in the blasts.
Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi announced a compensation of Rs 500,000 (US$ 11,500) to each victim of the bomb blasts.
Investigations.
Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami has claimed the responsibility of the blasts. The email mentioned that "the innocent Muslims arrested in the (Mumbai) bomb blast case are being tried for years and years."
Union Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta said the Centre dispatched one team of bomb experts and decided to convene a meeting of top officials of state governments to discuss the situation arising out of the recent explosions.
According to the "Times of India" the intelligence community believes that both blasts of Bangalore and Ahmedabad were executed by a network of Wahabi fundamentalists masquerading as Indian Mujahideen.
Legal case.
Controversy arose in the court case of the 26 accused as the state was alleged to have suppressed the legal rights of the accused. On 23 October lawyers of the accused walked out in protest against the stand taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate. The lawyers wanted to meet the accused alone, however, they had moved an application stating that police did not allow them to meet their clients alone and that the Court should direct the police not to remain present while they were talking to the accused. The Metropolitan Magistrate countered that it was not possible as police had to be with the accused. He is said to have hinted at collusion between the lawyers and the accused, causing a walk out by the accused's lawyers. The next day, in two different cases, the designated Metropolitan Court remanded all the 26 accused to police custody till 31 October.
As per the legal rules police have to file a chargesheet in any case before 90 days of the first arrest of the case. However, on 11 November, about three and half months after blasts and the late July arrest, the Gujarat police filed a chargesheet, pertaining to the city civil hospital blast and L G hospital blast case, in a court naming 26 people, all with alleged linkd to SIMI, as accuseds in the case. A 2,000-page chargesheet was filed in the court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, G M Patel. The accused included SIMI activists Mufti Abu Basher, Safdar Nagori and Sajid Mansuri. The chargesheet also listed the names of 50 absconders, and that police had so far examined 511 potential witnesses.
Similarities.
Similarities between the Bangalore and Ahmedabad bombings were investigated, where the former suffered from eight blasts and the latter 21. Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Prakash Jaiswal told reporters in Kanpur that the similarities between this and the Bangalore blasts was that both "blasts were of low intensity" and were planted in crowded areas. Furthermore, both states – Karnataka and Gujarat – have BJP led governments.
Further threats.
The threat of terror continued even after Ahmedabad blasts. The Gujarat police discovered an active bomb which was set to detonate at 12:00am IST in Hatkeshwar, Maninagar. A bomb squad was quick to respond and successfully managed to defuse the bomb in front of a large crowd, which rose to jubilation and applause upon bomb's defusion.
Kerala.
A phone call from Pakistan to a Karnataka journalist claimed there would be more blasts in Kerala on Sunday. Kerala police chief Raman Srivastava said: "I have been informed by the DGP of Karnataka about the terror threat to Kerala. We spoke to the journalist concerned, who said he had received two calls today – one at 1 pm and another at 3:30 pm."
Surat.
On the following Monday, just days after the Ahmedabad blasts, another bomb was found in Varacha area of Surat. The bomb was placed near an electricity transmitter and contained a packet 700–800 grams of ammonium nitrate, a packet of shrapnel, two detonators, one battery, and a circuit. This was found after the two car bombs that were discovered immediately after Ahmedabad attacks.
On Tuesday, 29 July, eighteen bombs were found in Surat, and were subsequently defused. They were found mainly in the diamond-processing and residential areas of Surat, within a span of just four hours. According to the Times of India, a top government official believed that the planting of so many "unexploded" bombs was probably a means to divert attention of the police from the ongoing blast probe. After Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi visited the city another bomb was found and defused by a bomb disposal squad. All in all, 23 bombs were found in three days in Surat.
Forensic investigations revealed that the bombs had not exploded because the circuits had been wrongly assembled. The police were not sure whether that was on purpose or a way to estimate the reaction time of the bomb squad, for planning future attacks.
Rajasthan.
Three bombs were detected on the road in Pali district, near Marwar in Rajasthan. The bombs, put in half-litre oil containers, were planted on the Marwar-Ranawas Road at gap of one km and were spotted by onlookers. The box carried a bundle of fuse wire, 30–40 marbles, 8 iron plates, and detonator. There was no timer nor any electronic devise attached to the explosives. The bombs were defused by the bomb squad.
Tamil Nadu.
In Tamil Nadu, Sheikh Abdul Ghaffoor, 39, was arrested with an alleged plan of carrying out bombings on Independence Day, 15 August 2008. The plot included bombing the state capital Chennai along with three other cities in Tamil Nadu and at least six trains. Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai is believed to be on top of the list for such terror attack. The man was detained with a large cache of explosives and two timer devices. Apparently, it is believed that the plot was revealed by an arrested leader, P Ali Abdullah, of a banned organisation, who has been serving sentences in an Indian jail since 2003. Chennai city police later on 1 August 2008 announced that the arrests were not linked with either the Ahmedabad or Bangalore blasts.
Kolkata.
An E-Mail was sent to Kolkata on 29 July 2008 to bomb 8 different locations in Kolkata. Subsequently, high alert was placed in Kolkata but the E-mail turned out to be a hoax.
New Delhi.
Another E-mail was sent to the Japanese Embassy in New Delhi on 30 July 2008 to bomb several locations in Delhi. The mail was soon forwarded to the Delhi Police from the Japanese Embassy and the city was placed under a Red Alert. The E-Mail threatened to bomb Sarojini Nagar which was a target in the October 2005 bombings. Further to these threats Japan closed its embassy in New Delhi on 31 July 2008 and also issue warning to its citizens living in India to avoid crowded places like markets and train stations. Nevertheless the initial examination of a youth arrested for sending emails to the Japanese embassy indicated that he might suffer from some mental problems. Delhi police revealed that the youth who sent the email was frustrated of a failed visa application to the embassy and the email threat was a hoax.
Criticism.
In criticizing the central government Ajai Sahni, executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management said "India's police to population ratio is one of the lowest in the world, barring the poorer African countries. There is a high deficit of personnel in intelligence gathering. The IB has barely 3,500 field officers. We need to address these shortcomings."
Security expert Prakash Singh added "they (terrorists) have no fear of being detected, arrested or prosecuted."
PR Chari, a research professor at the Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies, said "the blasts were a demonstration of their (terrorists) capabilities and a terse reminder of the state's helplessness."
BJP president Rajnath Singh also blamed the UPA government for its "soft approach" to terrorism that has allowed terrorists to grow bolder. He also took the government to task for repealing POTA and for "sleeping over the anti-terror laws like GUJCOCA (an anti-terror law adopted by the Gujarat Assembly)". Gujarat Congress chief Siddharth Patel said: "'The Gujarat government has failed miserably on the law and order front." Adding that the terror attack pointed to the "total failure' of the state's intelligence machinery."
Conspiracy theories.
Sushma Swaraj, a senior leader of the BJP, at a press conference in Delhi, claimed the ruling UPA government had a conspiratorial hand in the blasts to divert attention from the allegations of bribery as well as to gain Muslim votes. Times of India called her comments as "scandalous" and "outrageous remarks". The Congress party's spokesman, Shakeel Ahmed said that Sushma Swaraj should be "tried for treason" and her comments have "given a clean chit to terrorists and anti-national, disruptive forces both within and outside India". Later on 31 July 2008, BJP's spokesperson, Prakash Javdekar, clarified that the allegation of conspiracy made by Sushma Swaraj was her personal view and to the contrary the party viewed the attacks not as a conspiracy of the Congress party but as an "an attack on the nation". Although Sushma Swaraj's comments were critically commented by some media and her own party, T. K. Arun, a columnist of The Economic Times suggested that investigations should also look into her point that some of the blasts occurred in Muslim locals of Ahmedabad and ""that a large share of those getting slaughtered by the terrorists are Muslims"".
The US national to whom the suspicious e-mail was traced escaped from India even after a lookout notice was issued.
Reaction.
Hindu–Muslim Unity.
It is widely believed that the attacks were carried out to bring about the levels of unrest Gujarat had seen after the Godhra train burning. It is believed that by targeting communally sensitive areas such as Sharkej, Hindus and Muslims, attackers wanted to provoke and reignite communal disharmony and riots. However, the people of Gujarat stood tall in unity against such violence. Peaceful demonstrations held across Gujarat by both Hindus and Muslims called attacks an act of cowardice. Such demonstrations of unity were also held in Delhi and Bhopal where Hindus and Muslims held candlelight vigils.
Upon his visit to the region, PM Singh praised Gujarat's unity saying "I commend the people of Gujarat for the resilience they have shown. These terrorist acts are aimed at destroying our social fabric, undermining communal harmony and demoralising our people".
President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Vice-president Hamid Ansari, Chief Minister Narendra Modi, all condemned the blasts and appealed for calm. Minister of State for Home Affairs Shakeel Ahmed expressed surprise and shock at the successive attacks. Home Minister Shivraj Patil said: "we should assess the situation correctly and try to help the people, who have suffered and plan to see that these things do not happen afterwards."
Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party leader L. K. Advani condemned the blasts, and demanded that both Gujarat and Rajasthan should be allowed to go for their own anti-terror legislation.
The Bahujan Samaj Party questioned intelligence agencies failure to be alert to the blast conspiracy, and urged the state Congress to ask the UPA to approve GUJCOCAas. The Vishva Hindu Parishad announced it planned a nationwide anti-jehadi movement from 28 July, and urged the government to act against terrorism "before it is late." AIADMK general secretary J. Jayalalithaa called for the revival of special act like POTA to "effectively counter terrorists and extremist outfits".
A host of others who condemned the blasts included Head of the congress party Sonia Gandhi, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Prakash Jaiswal, CPI M, the All India Muslim Forum, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Sanchetna, Sahrwaru, Safar, AMWA, Muslim Majlise Mushavirat, Sarkhej Muslim Welfare Organisation, Ahmedabad Muslim Welfare Society, Sirat Committee, Aman Samuday, Anhad, Swabhiman Andolan, Lok Kala Manch, Samarpan, Sarvoday Sanskrutik Manch, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, Bharatiya Moolnivasi Janjagran Abhiyan, and Action Aid (Gujarat).

Moresca

Moresca (Italian, Spanish) or Mauresque (French) is a 15th/16th century pantomime dance in which the executants wore Moorish costumes. One such is the concluding music of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo. One of the best examples of the Moresca can be seen in Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 production of "Romeo and Juliet", which has a scene with Moresca characters and lavish, florid portrayal of the dance in the Capulet home.
The term moresca (Italian: moorish song) is also used for an unrelated form of villanella, an art song for 3 voices, found in Italy c.1550-1600, see; moresche.

Freilassing Locomotive World

The Freilassing Locomotive World ("Lokwelt Freilassing") is a railway museum in the Berchtesgadener Land, which is operated with the cooperation of the town of Freilassing and the Deutsches Museum. The museum is located on the site of the former Freilassing locomotive shed which belongs to the Deutsche Bahn AG and houses part of the Deutsches Museum's railway collection. The second part of the collection is in the transport centre of the Deutsches Museum on the Theresienhöhe in Munich.
The Site.
The locomotive shed was built between 1902 and 1905 on the railway line from Munich to Salzburg. Its facilities include a roundhouse and turntable, its own power station, workshops and equipment for the stabling and maintenance of railway vehicles and locomotives. The Deutsche Bahn AG used the site until 1994. With the closure and sale of the training workshops in 1998, the "Freilassing locomotive shed" era was finally over. The buildings were placed under historic building status the same year. In 2003 the town of Freilassing acquired the site with the cooperation of the Deutsches Museum's Transport Centre. The restoration and construction work for the 'Freilassing Locomotive World' museum began in autumn 2004. Almost simultaneously the society 'Friends of the Historic 1905 Freilassing Locomotive Shed' ("Freunde des Historischen Lokschuppens 1905 Freilassing e.V.") was founded, and they supported the museum energetically. On 2 September 2006 the Freilassing Locomotive World was officially opened to visitors.
The roof of the building was so badly damaged by hurricane Kyrill on 18/19 January 2007 that the Locomotive World had to be temporarily closed. Meanwhile the roof trusses were supported to ensure its stability. Even the rest of the damage was repaired sufficiently that the Locomotive World could once again be freely visited.
Museum Project.
On seventeen of the twenty roads of the roundhouse, numerous exhibits on the theme of "150 years of railway history" are displayed. Amongst them is a large railway fleet from the Deutsches Museum, that could not be accommodated in the museum's Transport Centre site opened in 2006 due to lack of space. The move of the exhibits was reported by Bahn TV under the title "A Museum Moves House". Even a few exhibits from the Nuremberg Transport Museum may be seen. The remaining three roads serve as workshops for the restoration, maintenance and care of historic locomotives and rolling stock.
A model railway layout replicates Freilassing locomotive shed at the time it was used by the Deutsche Bahn AG. For children aged 6 to 12 the "Lokomotive World" offers a fun park (the so-called "Kinderwelt") exploring the subjects of railways and technology. On certain days there are additional presentations or campaign days. The vehicle collection is being continually added to.
Special.
In October 2006 the nostalgic Istanbul Orient Express visited the Freilassing Locomotive World as the first 'special' after it had been opened in the September. (Bildergalerie). From the middle to the end of November 2006 the train was stationed in the Augsburg Railway Park, before it began a special trip from Augsburg to Salzburg. The train could be visited there for two days.

Moresque

Moresque is an obsolete alternative term to "Moorish" in English, and in the arts has some specific meanings. By itself the word is used of forms found in ornament and decoration in the applied arts in Europe. Often it is a synonym for arabesque or interlace patterns in the Mannerist and Northern Mannerist styles of the 16th century, derived from Islamic ornament. It was defined in 1611 by Randle Cotgrave's "A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues" as: "a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &c." The word is also used for such a figure, starting off as a human or animal, but terminating as part of a decorative scheme of foliage or geometric strapwork.
In fact the origin of figures like those described by Cotgrave comes not from the Islamic world, but from the Renaissance version, influenced by the Ancient Roman grotesque decorative style, of medieval ornament, especially that found in illuminated manuscripts. Here men and beasts whose forms disappear into geometric or foliage decoration go back almost a thousand years to the interlace of Insular art seen in the Book of Kells and other manuscripts. These themselves derive from the Animal style of barbarian Europe. However the term "moresque" is not used of these medieval versions.

Mr. Hong Kong

The Mr. Hong Kong Contest (), or Mr.HK (港男) for short, is a beauty contest for young men, organized by leading Hong Kong television station TVB. The contest has been an annual event since 2005, and winners will have the opportunity to represent Hong Kong for the Mister World contest.
Like the Miss Hong Kong Pageant, top Mr. Hong Kong contestants are awarded to a contract with TVB, and many of them become promoted television actors. A contestant and runner-up in 2005, Byron Pang, even went on to become a film star (in the 2009 Hong Kong movie Amphetamine).
The contest also has other consolation prizes that vary slightly from year to year. Unlike their female counterpart, Mr. Hong Kong does not have specific first and second runner-up positions. Contestants are divided into two groups, the Stylish Youth Division (瀟灑少年) and the Maturity Division (健力盛年), and a winner is chosen from both groups. The final winner (the Mr. Hong Kong) will then be determined by the top contestants of both groups.
Judges for the contest are all women, and winners of the contest are also determined by a public vote of 600 to 800 female viewers. The first ever winner of the contest was Matthew Ko.
The modern Mr. Hong Kong Contest is completely unrelated to the original Mr. Hong Kong bodybuilding contest from the 1970s.
Controversy.
Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority has received a number of complaints from the public regarding the Mr. Hong Kong Contest, in which the programme was said to be of bad taste and that the male contestants were treated as sex objects by the women in the show. These complaints were later dismissed. [http://www.hkba.hk/en/complaints/complaint_bacc/bacc201010e.html]

Augsburg Railway Park

The Augsburg Railway Park ("Bahnpark Augsburg") is a railway museum in Augsburg on part of the former Augsburg locomotive shed owned by the Deutsche Bahn. At present the Railway Park is still under construction and is therefore only open to visitors for certain exhibitions. It will be officially reopened on 13 April 2009. In the future, 29 historic locomotives from the EU member countries and also Switzerland will be exhibited in the roundhouse and on the turntable, the so-called Europa Roundhouse ("Rundhaus Europa"), which are protected historical buildings. In addition to the roundhouse there are also three historical steam locomotive halls with a workshop atmosphere and a historical smithy.
Museum project and events.
The "Augsburg Railway Park" offers the national railways of all EU states the opportunity to exhibit a historic locomotive (a so-called 'ambassador' locomotive) im the "Europa Roundhouse". The culture of the country of origin of an exhibition is always the focus. The historical locomotives will be accessible to visitors to the site or will be displayed on the turntable. From time to time there will also be national weeks (e. g. Austria week), sometimes with additional special exhibitions related to the region being celebrated. As part of some events there will be jazz concerts in the large steam engine hall and presentations in the smithy. In addition there are restaurants permanently on site. Regular jazz concerts ("Jazz in the Railway Park") take place on the first Sunday in the month from May to September. In addition to the ambassador locomotives there are many other museum locomotives in the collection, which it has not always been easy to view before. The whole collection is being continually expanded. During Advent, special steam engine services are organised, that offer journeys through the winter landscape.
The site.
In 1906 the Royal Bavarian State Railways built two roundhouses with turntables south of the Augsburg Hauptbahnhof (Augsburg Central Station). On the area surrounding the Railway Park are further buildings (workshops, washdown areas, wheelset repair workshops and accommodation for the locomotive crews) belonging to the former repair shop together with trackage and a signal box. In the Second World War the area was largely spared from bomb damage, even on the devastating night of bombing from 25 to 26 February1944 on Augsburg, during which the main station and station yard was badly damaged or destroyed. After the war the Deutsche Bahn AG used the site until about 1990. Since 1996 the roundhouse has been placed under historical building protection. The owner of the site is the Aurelis Real Estate GmbH & Co.KG.
Workshops.
In the workshops of the "Augsburg Railway Park", railway vehicles are refurbished and restored to museum standards. A historical post van was restored in these workshops for the Deutsches Museum's Transport Centre, a branch of the Deutsches Museum on the Teresienhöhe/Schwarntalerhöhe. The maintenance and preservation of the operational and protected DRG Class 41 steam locomotive, no. 41 018, belonging to the Munich Steam Locomotive Company ("Dampflok-Gesellschaft München") was also carried out by thse workshops.
Vehicles in the Europa Roundhouse.
Further ambassador locomotives are planned for Spring 2008.
Railway trolley collection 'rail midgets' ("Schienenflöhe").
As well as the ambassador and museum locomotives stabled at the "Augsburg Railway Park" there is also a small collection of railway trolleys belonging to the "Bavarian Railway Trolley Friends" ("Draisinenfreunde Bayern e.V."). This type of railway vehicle was formerly used by the railway maintenance divisions to inspect and maintain tracks and signal installations. The collection has a total of five vehicles: a touring trolley ("Bereisungsdraisine") KLV 11, two maintenance trolleys, KLV 12 and 82, a Hungarian trolley, MAV Pft-P401, a rail bicycle and a rail moped. At the events there are often opportunities to ride in the KLV 11, something especially popular with children. The KLV 12, KLV 82 and MAV Pft-P401 trolleys are not currently operational and are being refurbished.
Raupach steam engine.
The static steam engine was built in 1911 by the engineering works of "Richard Raupach", based on the system by R. Lenke, in Görlitz. It could generate 75 PS. Once upon a time, more than 1000 examples of this engine were built, that were used in many factories to provide electrical energy. Originally this particular engine was delivered to the Schaaf Brewery in Niedermending near Koblenz, where it was in service in 1932. But in the same year the engine was sold to the distillery in Munich-Grosshadern. There it was used to drive various aggregates. Not until the closure of the distillery in 2001 was the steam engine finally taken out of service, having operated for 90 years. Members of the Munich Steam Locomotive Company made contact with the distillery company and succeeded in acquiring the steam engine. On 26 July 2003, it was dismantled and moved by low-loader to the Railway Park. There it was temporarily housed in the northern roundhouse and restored. After the events exhibiting the steam engine in its intermediate location, it was moved at the end of October 2003. After further work, it was operational again on 16 July 2007. This time however it was not driven by steam, but for display purposed worked by an electric motor and illuminated.
150th anniversary of Rudolf Diesel.
On the occasion of the 150th birthday of Rudolf Diesel in 2008 the "Augsburg Railway Park" hosted a large locomotive exhibitino on Easter Monday on the theme of diesel locomotives. Not only were there diesel engines to be seen, but also historic lorries, buses, fire engines and tractors. The event's strap line was "Vehicles driven by diesel engines on rail or road". For younger visitors there was a children's programme with Easter egg hunts and tractor racing. One visitor was the diesel railbus VT 12.5 "Little Stuttgart Horse" ("Stuttgarter Rößle") owned by the "DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee", with 220 passengers. The Railway Park had a record number of over 5000 visitors that day.
Miscellaneous.
At present there is a TEE (Trans-Europ-Express) train rake VT 601 with 9 centre coaches, the so-called "Blue Star Train", next to the Railway Park on former DB land.
From the middle to end of November 2006 the Istanbul Orient Express train was stationed at the "Augsburg Railway Park" and could be visited during a two-day event. The chance to visit this historic train resonated with the public. The event was accompanied by a jazz concert and food as well as a special exhibition on the history of the Orient-Express. On 6 December 2006 the museum train began a special trip from Augsburg Main station to Salzburg. The train was hauled by an electric locomotive, not 41 018 as announced.
The Railway Park is a favourite destination of historic trains, such as the 01 1066 belonging to the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde ("Ulm Railway Friends"), which can be serviced and turned for the return journey.

At Her Majesty's pleasure

At Her Majesty's pleasure (sometimes abbreviated to "Queen's pleasure" or, when appropriate, "at His Majesty's pleasure" or "King's pleasure") is a legal term of art referring to the indeterminate length of service of certain appointed officials or the indeterminate sentences of some prisoners. It is based on the concept that all legitimate authority for government comes from the Crown. Originating in the United Kingdom, it is now used throughout the Commonwealth realms. In realms where the monarch is represented by a Governor-General, the phrase may be modified to be "at the Governor's pleasure", since the governor-general, governor, or lieutenant governor is the Queen's personal representative in the country, state or province.
Service to the Crown.
People appointed by the sovereign to serve the Crown and who have no set limit to the time they occupy their given office—for example, governors-general and ministers of the Crown—are said to "serve at Her Majesty's pleasure". In Canada, provincial lieutenant governors are appointed by the Canadian monarch's federal representative, the governor general, and are thus described in the Constitution Act, 1867, as holding office "during the pleasure of the Governor General." Similarly, Australian ministers of the Crown are, by the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, appointed to serve "during the pleasure of the Governor-General."
Incarceration.
The term is used to describe detainment in prison for an indefinite length of time; a judge may rule that a person be "detained at Her Majesty's pleasure" for serious offences or based on a successful insanity defence. This is sometimes used where there is a great risk of re-offending; however, it is most often used for juvenile offenders, usually as a substitute for life sentencing (which would naturally be much longer for younger offenders). For example, Britain's Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 states: "Where a person convicted of murder or any other offence the sentence for which is fixed by law as life imprisonment appears to the court to have been aged under 18 at the time the offence was committed, the court shall (notwithstanding anything in this or any other Act) sentence him to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure."
Prisoners held at Her Majesty's pleasure are frequently reviewed to determine whether their sentence can be deemed complete; although this power traditionally rested with the monarch, such reviews are now made by others—the Home Secretary in Britain, for instance. Minimum terms are also set, before which the prisoner cannot be released; in Britain, these were originally set by the Home Secretary, but since 30 November 2000 have been set by the trial judge. Prisoners' sentences are typically deemed to be complete when the reviewing body is "satisfied that there has been a significant change in the offender's attitude and behaviour."
Derivatives.
In Hong Kong, following the transfer of its sovereignty to China in 1997, the term was modified to "at executive discretion". Subsequently this was held to be incompatible with the separation of powers enshrined in the Basic Law by Judge Michael Hartmann in the case "Yau Kwong Man v. Secretary for Security".
In Botswana, it became "during the President's pleasure".

Craigslea State High School

Craigslea State High School is a public secondary school located in Chermside West in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, Australia. The school first opened in 1975 and was officially opened in 2000 by the honourable Dean Wells. The school is situated next door to Craigslea State Primary School and some facilities, such as the swimming pool, are shared between the two schools. It is also reputedly the first completely low-set public secondary school in Queensland and several of the buildings' entrance points have since been modified to provide convenient access to students in motorised wheelchairs. Most of the school's buildings were built in the mid-1970s, whereas the mid-2000s saw the opening of the school's auditorium and another building for the senior subject of commercial hospitality, which was established at the school in 2007. The grounds outside the science building and the library courtyard feature artworks created by the school's students, and from end 2010 to the start of 2011 school year the school was upgrading both Science and Year 8 Blocks, however due to many faults in the science block and having to close down again after it opened, it was not officially open until last term of 2011.
Approximately 200 students are enrolled in each year level, giving the school an average total population of 950 to 1000 per school year. 
The school has a volleyball program, Craigslea Volleyball Academy, which, according to the school's own annual report, "has attained national recognition".

<doc id="18593261" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18593261" title="The Scavengers">
The Scavengers

The Scavengers were a New Zealand punk rock band, formed in 1977. In 1979 they moved to Melbourne, Australia, and became The Marching Girls in 1980.
History.
The band was formed in 1976 at Auckland Technical Institute by graphic design students Ken Cooke, Simon Monroe, Mike Simons and Marlon Hartas, under the name The 1B Darlings. They were heavily influenced by , glam rock and '60s US garage rock. In 1977 they renamed themselves The Scavengers and gave themselves punk stage names (Cooke as Johnny Volume, Monroe as Des Truction, Simons as Mike Lezbian and Hart as Mal Icious). Their style mutated in the direction of the US punk rock and proto-punk acts. 
Through much of 1977 they were, with the Suburban Reptiles, the only punk bands in Auckland. In June 1977, with the Suburban Reptiles and The Masochists, they played New Zealand's first major punk gig at Auckland University. During this time their repertoire was mostly covers, but by early 1978 they had written a set of original tunes. In late 1977, bassist Hart left to be replaced by Brendan Perry, who performed under the stage name "Ronnie Recent". In March 1978 they began a residency at Zwines, a new Auckland punk club. Soon after Simons left (inspiring their signature song "Mysterex"), and Perry moved to vocals. 
Two Scavengers tracks appear on the Ripper compilation "AK79" and a posthumous album was released in 2003. 
The Marching Girls.
In 1979 The Scavengers moved to Melbourne, Australia and in 1980, they renamed themselves The Marching Girls, and issued some recordings and video clips.
Legacy.
Perry later formed Dead Can Dance and Monroe (aka Des Hefner) played briefly for The Birthday Party during the latter band's final tour of Australia and New Zealand. Monroe went on to play in a series of Melbourne-based acts including The Slaughtermen and Maurice Frawley. Both Cooke (Go Public and Daisy West) and Monroe are still working musicians in Melbourne.
The Scavengers were hugely influential in Auckland in the late 1970s, inspiring a whole generation of young bands, and their importance goes far beyond their few releases. They reformed in 2004 for a one-off show in Auckland without Perry, and again at the AK79 reunion in 2008.

John L. Ray

John L. Ray (born May 16, 1943) is a lawyer and Democratic politician in Washington, D.C. He was an at-large member of the Council of the District of Columbia from 1979 to 1997. Ray is a partner and member of the board of directors at the law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips.
Political career.
On January 8, 1979, Ray was appointed by the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee to the at-large council seat vacated by Marion Barry, who had been sworn in as mayor a few days earlier. He was Barry's chosen successor. Ray went on to win the May 1 special election handily and then to be reelected in 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992.
When council chairman John A. Wilson killed himself in May 1993, the council chose Ray to be acting chairman. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly had backed another at-large council member, Linda Cropp, for the appointment and thought she had lined up the votes on the council, but Charlene Drew Jarvis switched her vote to Ray because she intended to run for chairman in the special election and viewed Cropp as a threat. Ray served as acting chairman until the special election on September 14, which was won by former chairman David A. Clarke. Ray finished his term as at-large member but did not run for reelection in 1996.

<doc id="18593279" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18593279" title="Lesser short-nosed fruit bat">
Lesser short-nosed fruit bat

The Lesser short-nosed fruit bat ("Cynopterus brachyotis") is a species of megabat within the family Pteropodidae. It is a small bat that lives in South and Southeast Asia and Indonesia (Borneo). It weighs between . It occurs in many types of habitat, but most frequently in disturbed forest, including lower montane forest and tropical lowland rainforest, plus gardens, mangroves, and vegetation on beaches.
Description.
Lesser short-nosed fruit bats are generally brown to yellowish brown with a brighter collar. Adult males have dark orange collars whereas adult females have yellowish collars. An indistinct collar is observed in some immature bats. The edges of the ears and the wing bones are usually white. Individuals have two pairs of lower incisors, a fox-like face and large dark eyes. The forearm length is 55–65 mm (2.1–2.6 in), tail length is 8–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in), and ear length is 14–16 mm (0.5–0.6 in).
There are nine subspecies of lesser short-nosed fruit bat. Corbet and Hill listed 19 alternate names of "C. brachyotis", which include: "Pachysoma brachyotis", "P. duvaucelii", "P. brevicaudatum", "P. luzoniense", "C. grandidieri", "C. marginatus var. scherzeri", "C. marginatus var. ceylonensis", "C. marginatus var. philippensis", "C. marginatus var. cuminggii", "C. marginatus var. andamanensis", "C. brachyoma", "C. montanoi", "C. minutus", "C. minor", "C. babi", "C. archipelagus" and "C. nusatenggara". Kitchener and Maharadatunkamsi considered "luzoniensis" and "minutus" as separate species while Hill and Thonglongya transferred "angulatus" to "C. sphinx".
The lifespan of the lesser short-nosed fruit bat is approximately 20 to 30 years.
Similar species.
The greater short-nosed fruit bat is similar to the lesser short-nosed fruit bat but has generally longer forearms, longer ears and a much longer skull. "P. lucasi" has only one pair of lower incisors, a lack of white edges to the ears and a usually greyer color. "C. horsfieldi" is larger, with heavily cusped molars. "M. ecaudatus" usually has a more upturned nose, lacks a bright collar and tail, and has only one pair of lower incisors.
Diet.
Lesser short-nosed fruit bats are frugivorous. They prefer aromatic fruit, especially mangoes. The bats feed mainly on small fruits by sucking out the juices and soft pulp. They also eat nectar and pollen.
Reproduction.
The mating system of lesser short-nosed fruit bats is polygynous. In the Philippines, most populations give birth twice a year and pregnant females have been found in almost all months. The period of gestation is approximately 3.5 to 4 months. The mother nurses the young with milk for about six to eight weeks. It takes about a year for the male to become sexually mature, and most females become pregnant at approximately six to eight months of age. Medway observed that breeding was non-seasonal in Peninsular Malaysia and that a single young was produced and carried by the female during the early stage of its life. Breeding is also non-seasonal in Thailand. Most pregnancies occur from March to June with peaks in January and September. Lactation corresponds with the peak of the rainy season as well as the fruiting season. Both sexes take care of the young. Males play an active role in lactation and feeding the young. They have mammary glands that are same size as the those of the female and exceed 8% of their overall body mass.
Behavior.
Lesser short-nosed fruit bats prefer to roost in small groups in trees, under leaves, and in caves. Young males may roost alone. It is common for one male to roost with up to four females. Females may gather in groups of up to 20. To feed, the bats bite off the center part of palm fruit clusters, leaving a hollow for hanging, which is also the method they use to construct a shelter. Males may spend more than two months chewing the veins of leaves and palm fronds until they fall to form a shelter. Individuals use tactile, visual, and acoustic stimuli to communicate. They forage with their acute sense of smell and navigate with their keen vision.
Distribution and habitat.
The lesser short-nosed fruit bat type specimens were collected from the Dewei River in Borneo on September 12, 1836, and at Naga Cave near Jammut on the Teweh River, Borneo. 
They are widely distributed in Sri Lanka, southwest and northeast India, Bangladesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, southern China, southern Burma, Indochina, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, the Philippines and also on the Lesser Sunda Islands. They are found from sea level up to 1600 m in Borneo. The nominate subspecies, "C. b. brachyotis", is distributed in Borneo, Lombok, Peninsular Malaysia, the Philippines and Sulawesi. It is found widespread from sea level to 1,600 meters in altitude. "C. b. altitudinis" is confined to the highlands of Peninsular Malaysia, from the Cameron Highlands to Gunung Bunga Buah. "C. b. brachysoma" is found on the Andaman Islands; "C. b. cylonensis" in Sri Lanka; "C. b. concolor" in Enggano; "C. b. hoffetti" in Vietnam; "C. b. insularum" on the Kangean Islands; "C. b. javanicus" on Java; and "C. b. minutus" on Nias.
Ecological and economic importance.
Lesser short-nosed fruit bats are free of terrestrial predation because of their ability to fly. Some human cultures consume them as a delicacy. They play important roles in plant pollination. Plants such as bananas, avocados, dates, mangoes, peaches, and "Agave tequilana" depend on them for seed dispersal. The bats are considered to be crop pests since they consume and damage fruit.
Conservation status.
Lesser short-nosed fruit bats are designated a least-concern species by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) because the population is widely distributed, stable and still abundant. Possible threats may be habitat loss due to development, dams, and deforestation. The animals are being hunted for medical purposes, as reported in ICZN 2006.

Steve Neville

Steve Neville (born 18 September 1957 in Walthamstow, England) is an English former professional association footballer. In his 14 season career in the Football League he played in 494 games in which he scored 135 goals for Southampton, Sheffield United, Bristol City and in three spells at Exeter City. In England he was part of two divisional title winning teams and was a winner of the Football League Trophy. Near the end of his playing career he picked up a league champions medal playing for South China AA in Hong Kong.
Player.
Southampton.
Neville began his career as an apprentice with Southampton. He made half a dozen league appearances for Saints in 1977/78. Managed by Alan Ball, Southampton finished as runners up in England's second tier earning promotion to English football's top flight.
Exeter City (first spell).
Aged 20, Neville signed for Exeter City in the summer of 1978. This coincided with the beginning of 3 of the best seasons in the club's history in terms of league finishes. The three season spell of Third Division finishes of 9th, 8th and 11th have only been better by the club in the early 30s. He was a regular during the club's stay in the third tier in which he hit 22 goals in his 93 league games. Exeter also enjoyed some creditable cup runs. In Neville's first season there they included League Cup wins against Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers before being knocked out in the fourth round by Graham Taylor's resurgent Watford. The next season Exeter reached the same stage knocking out Birmingham City en route. However Neville did not see out the third of those three seasons with Exeter.
Sheffield United.
He joined a Sheffield United side midseason in 1980 who failed to hold their place in the Third Division. The season after The Blades bounced back to win the 1981/82 Fourth Division title under Ian Porterfield's management.
Exeter City (second spell).
Aged 22, in the 1982 close season he rejoined Exeter. The team had already peaked though and Exeter didn't reach the heights they did in Neville's first spell there. Exeter were relegated in 83/84, the season of the ill fated reign of Gerry Francis. In his 92 league games Neville scored 27 goals.
Bristol City.
In another mid season transfer he joined Bristol City in 1984 signed by Terry Cooper. In his late 20s, it was here Neville was to play the highest level football of his career. The Robins were competitive in the Third Division throughout Neville's time there, challenging for promotion with finishes of 5th, 9th and 6th. In his fourth season there Bristol City finished fifth meriting a place in the play offs where Walsall ultimately won the final. Neville hit 40 goals from his 134 league games.
Neville and his team mates made it to the 1985/86 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium. Winning 3-0 against Bolton in front of a crowd of 54,502, Neville picked up the man of the match award. The Robins made it to the final again the season after. However Neville didn't play in the final where his team mates lost to Mansfield Town on penalties. The decisive spot kick was missed by David Moyes.
Exeter City (third spell).
Aged 31, he rejoined Exeter for a third spell in the summer of 1988. Neville was again under Cooper's management. In 88/89 Exeter also enjoyed another League Cup run where Blackburn were eliminated as Exeter reached the fourth round again. They were knocked out by Sunderland in a replay after drawing 2-2 at home.
Neville helped the club win promotion back to Division Three in 1990. At the season's end Neville was selected for the divisional team of the year.
In this spell Neville played in 120 Exeter first team league games in which he scored 39 goals. In total for Exeter in the League he played in 305 games and scored 98 league goals. His meandering dribbling style earned him the terrace chant 'weave'.
South China.
In 1991 Neville left to play for South China AA, the historically most successful club in the Hong Kong League. South China ended the season as champions. In what has been described as a great period for Hong Kong domestic football, the runners up were South China's great rivals for four seasons in the early 90s, Eastern AA. As had been the case two seasons before with Exeter, Neville was selected for the divisional team of the year.
After playing.
In recent years he has coached in Australia for Western Australian state league side Sorrento, now he is reserve coach and assistant. His son, Scott Neville, is a pro footballer and has represented Australia at age group level.

Baker Street robbery

The Baker Street robbery was a robbery of the safe deposit boxes at a branch of Lloyds Bank on the corner of Baker Street and Marylebone Road, London, on the night of 11 September 1971. 
The robbers had rented a leather goods shop named Le Sac, two doors down from the bank, and tunnelled a distance of approximately passing under the intervening Chicken Inn restaurant. To avoid being overheard they only dug during weekends. They used a thermal lance to try to break into the vault but ultimately had to use explosives.
Robbery.
Robert Rowlands, a radio ham operator, overheard conversations between the robbers and their rooftop lookout at about 11 pm. He contacted police and tape recorded the conversations while the robbery was in progress, but there was insufficient information to identify which bank was being robbed. At 2 am a senior police officer alerted radio detector vans to track down the gang. Police checked the 750 banks within 10 miles of Mr Rowlands' receiver, including the Baker Street bank. At the time, the thieves were still in the bank, but the police failed to realise the fact because the security door was still locked. The thieves got away with £1.5m cash (2010: £16.5m) and valuables from safe deposit boxes. The total haul was believed to be near £3m (2010: £33.1m).
Aftermath.
It has often been reported that after four days of news coverage British authorities issued a D-Notice, requesting that such reporting be discontinued for reasons of national security and the story disappear from newspapers. It is claimed by national newspapers in recent years, that some of the security boxes contained embarrassing or nationally sensitive material and that the purpose of the request was to protect a prominent member of the British Royal Family. Rowlands, the aforementioned ham radio operator, claims that the police attempted to prevent him from talking to the press by means of the D-Notice, which he felt was an attempt to hide police incompetence. He also claims that police threatened to prosecute him for listening to an unlicensed radio station. An investigation some years later showed that a request had never been made to the D-Notice committee at that time. Furthermore, a D-Notice has no legal status, being a mere request and not a legally enforceable order. "The Times" newspaper was still reporting about the case over two months later.
Other recent reports suggest that the identity of the criminals and their sentences have never been revealed. However, "The Times" (amongst other newspapers) reported in January 1973 that four men had been convicted of the robbery at a trial at the Old Bailey. Three of these men were named as: Anthony Gavin, 38, a photographer from Dalston; Thomas Stephens, 35, a car dealer from Islington; and Reginald Tucker, 37, a company director from Hackney, who all pleaded guilty and who each received twelve years imprisonment. The fourth man, Benjamin Wolfe, 66, a fancy goods dealer from East Dulwich, pleaded not guilty but was subsequently convicted and received eight years. Wolfe had signed the lease on the shop used by the robbers. Two other men accused of handling banknotes from the robbery were acquitted. According to one press report, the police believed that the mastermind of the crime was another London car dealer who was never apprehended.
In popular media.
A semi-fictional version of the robbery is the subject of the 2008 film "The Bank Job", which explores another popular theory of the crime that argues the robbery was either set up by, or later covered up by, MI5 to secure sexually compromising photographs of Princess Margaret which were being kept in a deposit box at the bank by known radical Michael X. While this theory has usually been considered yet another urban myth, there have been some individuals, including George McIndoe, an advisor to the film who claimed to have knowledge of the actual robbery, purporting that this was indeed the real motivation for the robbery.
There are also some similarities between the robbery and Troy Kennedy Martin's 1975 episode "Night Out" for the first series of "The Sweeney". The story sees Inspector Jack Regan holed up in a pub over Saturday night and Sunday morning waiting for a gang of villains who have broken through from the pub basement to the safe deposit vault of the bank next door. Meanwhile the police are listening in to radio traffic between the robbers in the vault and the gang's spotter on the pub roof. Money is not the primary objective of the robbers. Instead they are after—and the Crime Squad want to capture them with—a mysterious envelope tied with seals and red tape that the gang's leader secures with a flourish at the climax of act II. By the end of the show, the Crime Squad superintendent has recovered all of the spoils; but a press enquiry "Were they after one particular thing?" is met with a curt "no comment"
On the episode commentary (2003), Troy Kennedy Martin is asked whether this was based on any particular crime, and responds "No. Just dreamed up," though he "can't quite think" of the genesis of it. Earlier in the commentary, producer Ted Childs notes that he once had a visit from the Home Office asking whether the show was paying criminals for information; but was able to reassure them that the show simply had young and imaginative writers.
The robbery also loosely inspired the plot of the 2001 comedy "High Heels and Low Lifes" starring Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack. Driver's character, a nurse, overhears chatter between a robbery gang and their lookout, and when her police report fails to stir any action, she and her friend (McCormack) track down the thieves and attempt to blackmail them.

Auto-da-Fé (novel)

Auto da Fé (original title "Die Blendung", "The Blinding") is a 1935 novel by Elias Canetti; the title of the English translation (by C. V. Wedgwood, 1946) refers to the burning of heretics by the Inquisition. 
Publication history.
The book manuscript was finished in 1931, and the book was published in 1935, by Herbert Reichner in Vienna (Canetti's hometown at that time). It is Canetti's first publication.
In 1943 Canetti got an offer to publish the book in English with Jonathan Cape, but it was decided to delay publication until after the war. It was eventually released in 1946. The book did not become widely known until after the worldwide success of Canetti's "Crowds and Power" (1960). Jonathan Spence observes that "there is nothing discreet, chaste, or high minded about the finest and wildest of all fictions that centre on a student of China, Canetti's "Auto-da-fe"." 
Plot and themes.
The protagonist is Herr Doktor Peter Kien, a middle-aged philologist and Sinologist, uninterested in human interaction or sex, content with his monkish, highly disciplined life in his book-lined apartment in Vienna.
"He himself was the owner of the most important private library in the whole of this great city. He carried a minute portion of it with him wherever he went. His passion for it, the only one which he had permitted himself during a life of austere and exacting study, moved him to take special precautions. Books, even bad ones, tempted him easily into making a purchase. Fortunately, the great number of the book shops did not open until after eight o'clock."
Kien is absorbed in his studies of Chinese and shuns social and physical contacts. He is almost obsessive-compulsive in his efforts to avoid contamination, and much of the book is a comedy of his being thrown into close contact with a world that he fears, and doesn't wholly understand: "You draw closer to truth by shutting yourself off from mankind" (Canetti, 15). 
He impulsively marries his ignorant housekeeper of eight years, Therese Krummholz, imagining that she will help keep his library safe. But within days of marriage, the two enter a violent and divided existence. Kien becomes deeply agitated when cut off from three-quarters of his library to accommodate a separate living space for his bride. Ultimately she forces him out entirely. He is deeply bereaved, since to him the books are more alive than people:
"Books have no life; they lack feeling maybe, and perhaps cannot feel pain, as animals and even plants feel pain. But what proof have we that inorganic objects can feel no pain? Who knows if a book may not yearn for other books, its companions of many years, in some way strange to us and therefore never yet perceived?" (Canetti, 67). " 
Kien descends to the depths of society, meeting the dwarf Fischerle, and the blacksmith Gene, who is the cause of his demise. Kien's brother, Georges Kien, a psychiatrist, tries in vain to cure him, perhaps reflective of the author's antagonistic stance toward Freudian psychoanalysis. Canetti's friend, the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, felt that the character was modeled on Canetti's brother Nessim, who at the time lived in France, worked for Polydor Records and was an impresario for French chanson through the nightclub he ran there. "Hadn't I, he asked me, gone wrong out of love for my younger brother, whom I had told him about? No one, he insisted, could have so many skins; I had constructed an ideal character; what a writer does in his books, Georges Kien did in his life ...".
Ultimately, his marriage—intended to protect both himself and his library—destroys them instead, in the conflagration alluded to by the English-language title, "Auto-da-Fe".

<doc id="18593371" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18593371" title="Self-domestication">
Self-domestication

Self-domestication refers to the process of adaptation of wild animals to humans, without direct human selective breeding of the animals. The term is also used to refer to biological processes in the evolution of humans and human culture.
In animals.
Wild animals may "self-domesticate" when tame behaviour enhances their survival near humans.
Tolerating or even enjoying the close approach of humans in order to feed near them, and a lessening of natural adult aggression, are two aspects of tameness. An environment that supports the survival of tame animals can lead to other changes in behaviour and appearance as well.
Smaller skulls on tame animals have been noticed in other species. Noticing that a dog's skull looks like that of a juvenile wolf, Richard Wrangham goes on to say that "this leads to the thought that species can self-domesticate." Other characteristics that are associated with juvenility – barking and meowing (sounds used by wolf cubs and kittens of large felines, respectively, to communicate with their parents), more playful and less aggressive, and more eager to learn – are seen in tame animals.
Cats.
Self-domestication is described by biological anthropologist Richard Wrangham as being in an environment where lessening of aggression was beneficial for survival. As grain plants and livestock became domesticated 9,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, wild cats adapted to living with humans, hunting rodents in grain stores and "abandoning their aggressive wild-born behaviors", which led to today's house cats.
Dogs.
The distance an animal will allow a human to approach before it runs away, or "flight distance", is a measure of tameness. Wild wolves are both aggressive and quick to flee from humans, but they are the ancestors of dogs. Biologist Raymond Coppinger, in work with wild wolves, finds that directly taming a wild wolf is very difficult, and must begin before the animal is nineteen days old. He finds it far more likely that "the wolves domesticated themselves" (self-domesticated) into dogs over time, when wolves that could tolerate the closeness of humans were better able to find food in human village waste, and therefore those wolves' survival was enhanced.
Foxes.
Research done beginning in 1959 by the Soviet geneticist Dmitri Belyaev on silver foxes selectively bred only for tameness revealed that a whole range of other physical and behaviourial features, such as neoteny, also appeared along with the tameness, characteristics that were not specifically the result of selective breeding by humans. White spots on their fur, floppy ears, rolled tails and smaller skulls were seen in the tame foxes, and the foxes were also described as "incredibly endearing."
Belyaev and his successors also selectively bred wild rats for tameness, with similar results. These results with selective breeding suggest that the natural process of self-domestication can occur within a single human generation.
In humans.
Self-domestication describes theories of how humans developed and evolved. The idea of self-domestication was used by early Social Darwinism which, according to psychiatrist Martin Brüne in an article "On human self-domestication", developed from the idea that humans could perfect themselves biologically.
"Contemporary reproductive technologies such as selective abortion and genetic screening are typical examples where our self-domestication is most directly apparent," writes philosopher Masahiro Morioka, who also says that "Through domesticating ourselves like cattle, people began civilization."
Gregory Stock, director of the UCLA School of Medicine's Program of Medicine, Technology and Society, describes self-domestication as a process which "... mirrors our domestication animals ... we have transformed ourselves through a similar process of self-selection ... our transformation has been primarily cultural, but it has almost certainly had a biological component."

Haydon Hill

Haydon Hill is part of the town of Aylesbury, England. The neighbourhood is to the north of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. It occupies the area to the north of the town and to the west of the A41, Bicester Road.
The estate was built during the 1970s and 1980s as part of a major housing expansion. 
Although mostly housing, Haydon Hill has a community centre on Dickens Way. It is a compact venue for smaller functions having a capacity for 100 people dancing and 50 people if seated. It has a small kitchen and access for people with disabilities.
History.
The land is believed to have formerly been mainly farmland. The word ‘Haydon’ may mean ‘an enclosure’ or ‘a hedged in enclosure’, although the area has had the name written in variations such as 'Haydon', 'Heydon', 'Heyden' and 'Heydone'
The earliest record of any human activity in the area was found in 1978 when the estate was under construction. A large amount of pottery, three pieces of burned bone and a fragment of a bronze ligula (small Roman spoon ) were found in the spoil cast up from a pipe trench being laid. The Ligula and pottery dates from the early Iron Age to 5th-century Roman.
During the Roman period Akeman Street (which was a Roman road from London to Cirencester) passed through the eastern boundary of the estate. Akeman Street closely follows the line of the A41, Bicester Road. Most Roman roads were raised on a slight causeway, especially where they crossed wet ground, in order to provide drainage. This low bank or agger can often be traced even if the surfacing material (rammed chalk, gravel, iron slag or the like) has long since been denuded or covered by vegetation. At Haydon Hill there was a distinct Agger visible at the location of Haydon Hill Farm.
Also on the estate Roman finds were made including a quantity of bones and numerous amounts of pottery found in 1897 numerous amounts of pottery, spindle whorls etc. in 1923. And in 1954 numerous amounts of pottery, a 3rd-century Coin, spearheads and horseshoes. These finds were located on the top of the hill, on the western edge of the estate along the course of Akeman Street and on the eastern edge where the Haydon Hill Railway Cutting is located. There is to this date though no apparent or other evidence to indicate a specific habitation site.
In 1976 a 2nd-century Roman Cremation burial was found during trenching for the water mains when the estate was under construction.
The earliest reference of a property in Haydon Hill is in the Domesday Book of 1315. It makes reference to Heydone Mill which formed part of the Manor of Herdewelle (now the Manor of Hartwell in Stone). A document of 1341 mentions property 'abutting on the water from Haydon Mill'. 
In 1554 the limits of the borough of Aylesbury as recited in the charter of incorporation were from Glasyers Bridge (in Walton, Buckinghamshire) to Stannebridge (Stonebridge on the A41), in width from Holmansbridge (on the Buckingham road) to Walbridge (on the road to Thame, Oxfordshire). The Stannebridge or Stonebridge described is the crossing on the A41 over the River Thame on the far eastern boundary of the Haydon Hill estate. Visitors to Quarrendon (village) would have crossed the stannebridge which was a key vantage-point. Ahead he would have seen the west end of the church, the new almshouses, the formal gardens to the right, the great house straight ahead, and the warren on the skyline beyond. Looking up and down stream he would have seen sheep and cattle grazing the rich pasture that was the source of Henry Lee’s wealth.
The current Haydon Mill is a Grade II watermill built in 1834 which is now disused. The mill is believed to have ceased working in 1928. The mill is a red and yellow brick building with a hipped slate roof and projecting eaves. It is three storeys tall, has three bays (bay meaning a division of an elevation or interior space as defined by regular vertical features such as arches, columns or windows). There is a lean-to first storey extension on the right hand side of the building. The wheel has been dismantled but some machinery remains.
Administration.
Haydon Hill is within the Quarrendon ward of Aylesbury Vale local authority in the South East region. Aylesbury Town Council is the parish council.

Career.
Rowbotham was born in Cardiff, Wales. He began his career as a junior with Plymouth Argyle, and turned professional with the club in November 1984. Three years later he joined local rivals Exeter City. A key player in Exeter winning the Fourth Division title in the 1989–90 season, his goalscoring had linked him with possible moves to top-flight football. However, he sustained a serious knee injury which kept him out of football for a year, after which his career was restricted to the lower divisions of the Football League.
After four years at Exeter, where he scored 58 goals in 142 games in all competitions, he joined Torquay United for a fee of £25,000. Only four months later he moved on again, following his former Exeter manager Terry Cooper to Birmingham City for a fee of £20,000.
Lack of goals for Birmingham resulted in loan spells at Mansfield Town and Hereford United before he left on a free transfer, signing for Crewe Alexandra before the 1993–94 season. He spent two years there, followed by an 18-month spell at Shrewsbury Town, before returning to Exeter in 1996. He remained at Exeter for four years, including a month on loan to Leyton Orient, before being released at the end of the 1999–2000 season. He ended his career playing alongside brother Jason for Weymouth in the Southern League.

Crowds and Power

Crowds and Power (original German title "Masse und Macht") is a 1960 book by Elias Canetti, dealing with the dynamics of crowds and "packs" and the question of how and why crowds obey rulers. Canetti draws a parallel between ruling and paranoia. Also, the memoirs of Daniel Paul Schreber are analyzed with an implicit critique of Sigmund Freud.
The book was translated from German into English by Carol Stewart in 1962 and published by Gollancz.
It is notable for its unusual tone; although wide ranging in its erudition, it is not scholarly or academic in a conventional way. Rather, it reads like a manual written by someone outside the human race explaining to another outsider in concise and highly metaphoric language how people form mobs and manipulate power. Unlike most non-fiction writing, it is highly poetic and seething with anger.
On asking questions:
"On the questioner the effect is a feeling of enhanced power. He enjoys this and consequentially asks more and more questions; every answer he receives is an act of submission. Personal freedom consists largely in having a defense against questions. The most blatant tyranny is the one which asks the most blatant questions." 
This work remains important for the insights it provided into the Eastern European upheaval which can be understood within the framework Canetti puts forth. Showing the growth of crowds and their power against even the power of the state.
Canetti’s Crowds and Power remains an important work of our century, the insights
of which in recent years have once again been corroborated in a particularly spectacular
fashion. The Eastern European political and economic transition, which has proved to
be especially fruitful from a theoretical point of view, can be meaningfully interpreted
and hermeneutically “read” within the framework of Canetti’s mass psychology.

He was a member of the Russian national team that competed in the IIHF World Championship's under 18 and under 20 levels; winning a silver medal for the country in 2007. Anikeyenko was drafted 70th overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators. He died along with most of the Lokomotiv team in a plane crash on the first day of the 2011–12 season.
Death.
On September 7, 2011, Anikeyenko was killed in a plane crash when a Yakovlev Yak-42 passenger aircraft, carrying nearly his entire Lokomotiv Yaroslavl team, crashed at Tunoshna Airport, just outside the city of Yaroslavl, Russia. The team was traveling to Minsk to play their opening game of the season, with its coaching staff and prospects. Lokomotiv officials confirmed that the entire main roster was on the flight, including four players from the junior team. The bodies of Ukrainian teammates Anikeyenko and Daniil Sobchenko were repatriated following the crash for burial in Ukraine. The funeral was held on September 10 at Sovskoe cemetery in Kiev.

John Robertson Reid

John Robertson Reid (1851–1926) was a Scottish painter who spent his early working life in Surrey, and then from the early 1880s in Cornwall in the wild south-west of England. He became the president of the Society of British Artists in 1886 and the Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in 1898. These posts gave him an entree into London society, and from the early 1900s he made his home in London. In Reid's later years, the young Sir Winston Churchill used to paint outdoors in the company of Reid.
He trained under George Chalmers and William MacTaggart. His mature style was influenced by the move in painting toward rural Naturalism (Sir George Clausen) and the French Realists (Jules Bastien-Lepage) and also owes a little to Impressionism. He first found success with natural outdoor scenes of the Surrey countryside, and was notable at the time for painting his scenes entirely on location, with the use of hired local people posing in the scene. He also painted notable rural cricket match scenes, one of which now contain details of interest to cricketing historians. This is "A Country Cricket Match", painted in the grounds at the rear of The Well House, West Sussex.
His sisters, Lizzie Reid and Flora MacDonald Reid (1879-c.1929), were also exhibiting artists. Reid was the great-uncle of Sir Norman Reid, Director of the Tate Gallery.

Mirco Antenucci

Mirko Antenucci (born 8 September 1984) is an Italian footballer and striker currently playing for Ternana Calcio in the Italian Serie B, on loan from Calcio Catania..
Club career.
Giulianova.
Antenucci began his professional career in 2002, with Serie C1 club, Giulianova Calcio, where in two seasons with the club, the young striker managed to make 35 appearances, before spending the 2004–05 season on loan at Serie C2 side, A.C. Ancona. During his loan spell with the club, Antenucci scored 2 goals in 27 league appearances, before returning to Giulianova Calcio in the summer of 2005. In his second tenure with the Teramo based club, Antenucci scored 12 goals in 57 league matches, over the course of two seasons.
Calcio Catania.
In July 2007 he was signed by Serie A side, Calcio Catania and was loaned to S.S.C. Venezia ahead of the 2007–08 Serie C1 campaign. He made 27 league appearances that season, scoring 6 goals.
On 1 July 2008, Antenucci returned to Catania and entered into the first team squad. He made 4 substitute appearances under, then coach, Walter Zenga in the first half of the 2008–09 Serie A season. On 5 January 2009, however, Mirco Antenucci was sent out on loan to Serie B club Pisa Calcio, to gain experience and playing time. During his six-month spell with the Serie B club, Antenucci scored just 1 goal in 20 league appearances, and the club failed to avoid relegation and also bankrupted. He returned to Catania on 30 June 2009.
On 19 August 2009, Catania opted to send out the striker on another loan deal to Ascoli where he joined fellow Catania loanees Marcello Gazzola and Vito Falconieri. Following his transfer to Ascoli, the player really thrived, earning a regular starting role, and going on to make 40 appearances in the league, scoring an impressive 24 goals. He only missed 2 league matches: the first round of the season and once due to suspension. The player returned to Catania ahead of the 2010–11 Serie A season. Antenucci did make 14 league appearances for Catania that season, although most of them were off the substitute's bench. After just 1 goal, Antenucci was sent out on a co-ownership agreement.
On 23 January 2011, it was announced that he joined Torino F.C. in a co-ownership deal. In his first 6-month spell with the club, Antenucci scored 6 goals in 19 appearances, before turning in an additional 10 goals in 40 league appearances the following season. His efforts helped guide the club to a second place finish in the 2011–12 Serie B standings, and hence, promotion to Serie A.
On 21 June 2012, Calcio Catania out-bided Torino in a blind auction for the player's co-ownership, and so the 28-year old returned to Sicily ahead of the 2012–13 Serie A season. After making a substitute appearance in matchday 1 of the season on 26 August 2012, the player was sent out on loan to Spezia Calcio of the Italian Serie B, on yet another season-long loan deal.
He was loaned to Serie B side Ternana Calcio on 20 July 2013.

Simi Valley, California

Simi Valley is a city located in the valley of the same name, Simi Valley, in the southeast corner of Ventura County, California, United States. It is part of the Greater Los Angeles Area. The city is adjacent to Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and unincorporated places in the San Fernando Valley. Simi Valley is 30 miles from the radial area of Downtown Los Angeles and 3 miles from the Los Angeles neighborhood of Chatsworth. According to the United States Bureau of the Census, the city had a population of 126,874 in 2012, up from 111,351 in 2000.
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, where the former president was buried following his death in 2004, is in Simi Valley.
The city of Simi Valley is surrounded by the Santa Susana Mountain range and the Simi Hills, west of the San Fernando Valley and east of the Conejo Valley. It is largely a commuter bedroom community feeding the larger cities in Ventura County to the west and the Los Angeles area and the San Fernando Valley to the east.
A study done by the University of Vermont ranked Simi Valley as the fifth-happiest city in the United States.
History.
Pre-colonial period.
Simi Valley was once inhabited by the Chumash people, who also settled much of the region from the Salinas Valley to the Santa Monica Mountains, with their presence dating back 10,000-12,000 years. Around 5,000 years ago these tribes began processing acorns, and harvesting local marshland plants. Roughly 2,000 years later, as hunting and fishing techniques improved, the population increased significantly. Shortly after this sharp increase a precious stone money system arose, increasing the viability of the region by offsetting fluctuations in available resources relating to climate changes.
Simi Valley's name is said to originate from the Chumash word "Shimiyi", which refers to the stringy, thread-like clouds that typify the region.
Colonial rancho and town.
Rancho Simi, also known as Rancho San José de Nuestra Senora de Altagarcia y Simi, was a Spanish land grant in eastern Ventura and western Los Angeles counties given in 1795 to Francisco Javier Pico and his two brothers, Patricio Pico and Miguel Pico by Governor Diego de Borica. Rancho Simi was the earliest Spanish colonial land grant within Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. The name derives from "Shimiji," the name of the Chumash Native American village here before the Spanish. It was one of the largest lands, but later when Mexico became independent from Spain, land was handed out much more freely. The Simi Adobe-Strathearn House, later the home of Robert P. Strathearn, served as the headquarters of the rancho.
José de la Guerra y Noriega, a Captain of the Santa Barbara Presidio, who had begun to acquire large amounts of land in California to raise cattle, purchased Rancho Simi from the Pico family in 1842. A few years after Jose de la Guerra’s death in 1858, the rancho was sold to the Philadelphia and California Petroleum Company headed by Pennsylvania Railroad president, Thomas A. Scott. When no great amount of oil was discovered, Scott began to sell the rancho. In 1887, a portion of the rancho was bought by a newly formed company, the Simi Land and Water Company.
The small colonial town known as "Santa Susana del Rancho Simi" throve in the late 19th century and had a Spanish-speaking majority, but since then many Anglo-Americans have arrived to settle. Farms, orchards and groves dominated the valley's landscape until the 1970s.
For a brief time, its postal address was known as Simiopolis, though it was soon shortened again to Simi by 1910. The first public school was built in 1890 in the northeast but was torn down in 1926. There was also a great deal of destruction caused by a flood in 1952. The city incorporated as Simi Valley in 1969, when the area had only 10,000 residents. In 1972, Boys Town West was founded in the eastern end of Simi Valley. The youth camp/home facility is based on an older larger one in Boys Town, Nebraska.
Santa Susana Field Laboratory.
The Santa Susana Field Laboratory located in the Simi Hills, was used for the development of pioneering nuclear reactors and rocket engines beginning in 1948. The site was operated by Atomics International and Rocketdyne (originally both divisions of the North American Aviation company). The Rocketdyne division developed a variety of liquid rocket engines. Rocket engine tests were frequently heard in Simi Valley. The Atomics International division of North American Aviation designed, built and operated the Sodium Reactor Experiment, the first United States nuclear reactor to supply electricity to a public power system. The last nuclear reactor operated at SSFL in 1980 and the last rocket engine was conducted in 2006. The SSFL has been closed to development and testing. The site is undergoing investigation and removal of the nuclear facilities and cleanup of the soil and groundwater. The Boeing Company, the US DOE and NASA are responsible for the cleanup.
In July 1959, the Sodium Reactor Experiment suffered a serious incident when 13 of the reactor's 43 fuel elements partially melted resulting in the controlled release of radioactive gas to the atmosphere. The reactor was repaired and returned to operation in September, 1960. The incident at the Sodium Reactor Experiment has been a source of controversy in the community. Technical analysis of the incident intended to support a lawsuit against the current landowner (The Boeing Company) asserts the incident caused the much greater release of radioactivity than the accident at Three Mile Island. Boeing's technical response concludes the monitoring conducted at the time of the incident shows only the allowable amount of radioactive gasses were released, and a Three Mile Island-scale release was not possible. The case was settled, it is reported, with a large payment by Boeing. In September 2009, The U.S. Department of Energy sponsored a public workshop where three nuclear reactor experts shared their independent analysis of the July, 1959 incident.
The Santa Susana Field Laboratory also hosted the Energy Technology Engineering Center. The center performed the design, development and testing of liquid metal reactor components for the United States Department of Energy from 1965 until 1998.
The Santa Susana Field Laboratory includes sites identified as historic by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and by the American Nuclear Society. The National Register of Historic Places listed Burro Flats Painted Cave is located within the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, on a portion of the site owned by the U.S. Government. The drawings within the cave have been termed "the best preserved Indian pictograph in Southern California."
Rodney King trial.
On November 27, 1991, Judge Stanley Weisberg of the California Court of Appeals selected Simi Valley as the venue for the case against four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. The officers (Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, and Theodore Brisenio) were accused of using unnecessary force in a March 3, 1991 beating of an African-American motorist "Rodney" Glen King. The case known as the Rodney King Trial was based on footage recorded on home video by a bystander (George Holliday). The now-famous video was broadcast nationally and caused tremendous response because the beating was believed to be racially motivated. Selecting Simi Valley as a venue for the trial is believed to be motivated by the predominantly white ethnic make-up of the city at the time.
On April 29, 1992, a Ventura County jury acquitted three of the four officers (Koon, Wind, and Brisenio) and did not reach a verdict on one (Powell). Many believed that the unexpected outcome was a result of the racial and social make-up of the jury, which, reflecting the area's population demographic, included ten whites, one Filipino, and one Hispanic. None were Simi Valley residents. Among the jury were three who had been security guards or in military service. The acquittal led to the 1992 Los Angeles riots and mass protest around the country.

Landmarks.
Simi Valley is home to two California Historical Landmarks:
NO. 939 Twentieth Century Folk Art Environments (Thematic) - Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village[http://www.bottlevillage.com] - This fantastic assemblage is one of California's remarkable Twentieth Century Folk Art Environments. In 1956, Tressa Prisbrey, then nearly sixty years old, started building a fanciful 'village' of shrines, walkways, sculptures, and buildings from recycled items and discards from the local dump. She worked for 25 years creating one structure after another to house her collections. The Mosaic Walkway is embedded with thousands of treasures—tiles, shells, doorknobs, irons, car ornaments, jewelry, dishware, scissors, guns, toys — everything imaginable that creates a timestamp of 1950s post-consumer waste. Bottle Village originally had more than 13 buildings and 20 sculptures. Although severely damaged during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. It is located at 4595 Cochran St, Simi Valley.
NO. 979 Rancho Simi - This is the site of the headquarters of the Spanish Rancho San José de Nuestra Senora de Altagarcia y Simi. The name derives from 'Shimiji,' the name of the Chumash village here before the Spanish. At , Rancho Simi was one of the state's largest land grants. Two prominent Spanish and Mexican family names are connected with the Rancho: Santiago Pico who first received the grant, and José de la Guerra who purchased the Rancho in 1842. Two rooms of original adobe remain, part of the Strathearn home built in The Strathearn Historical Park and Museum, an open-air park that is owned and maintained by the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, and is operated jointly with the Simi Valley Historical Society. The house is maintained as a historic house museum with typical period furniture and household displays. In addition to the Simi Adobe-Strathearn House, there are various historic buildings and structures that have been moved from their original site to the park, including the a 1924 children's playhouse with toys, the 1902 St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, the original Simi Valley Library and two barns with farm tools and equipment. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places: NPS-78000825. Location: Robert P Strathearn Historical Park, 137 Strathearn Place, Simi Valley.
Simi Valley is also home to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which has been visited by more than 1 million people since it opened. After a major state funeral in Washington, D.C., President Reagan was buried at the library in June 2004. The library adjoins a hangar in which the Boeing 707 SAM 27000 (Air Force One), which served presidents Nixon through G.W. Bush, is housed and available for tours. In the pavilion are various automobiles used to transport the president, as well as Marine One, the presidential helicopter.
Infrastructure.
The Montalvo Cutoff, a railroad line opened by the Southern Pacific Railroad on March 20, 1904, to improve the alignment of its Coast Line, runs east-west through the valley. In 1905, the longest train tunnel in the United States at that time was completed at the east end of Simi Valley. Tunnel #26 still stands today linking Simi Valley and the San Fernando Valley. [http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/980/files/sspshp%20archaeology%20resources%20inventory.pdf][http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/980/files/sspshp%20historic%20resources.pdf][http://www.americassuburb.com/dates.html] The area was originally served by the Santa Susana Depot which was also opened in 1904 as a combination passenger and freight depot built by the Southern Pacific and located on Los Angeles Avenue near Tapo Street. The station remained in use for the following 60 years until changes in the business model for railroads evolved that rendered the depot useless to the railroad.
Simi Valley Station is used by Amtrak and Metrolink on the railroad's Ventura County Line, after the line was purchased from Southern Pacific. The station is located at 5000 Los Angeles Avenue, west of Stearns Street. Simi Valley Transit buses stop on Los Angeles Avenue in front of the station. There are connections from Simi Valley north to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, and south to Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties.
These trains, as well as the buses, run 7 days a week and stop in Simi Valley several times each day. The Simi Valley station is unstaffed; however, tickets are available from automated ticket dispensers, conductors on board the trains, travel agents, by telephone, or from the Amtrak and Metrolink websites.
The United States Postal Service operates the Simi Valley Post Office at 2511 Galena Avenue, the Kopy King Post Office at 2157 Tapo Street, and the Mount McCoy Post Office at 225 Simi Village Drive.
Economy.
In Simi Valley there are two main areas of industry — one in the eastern part of the city and the other one in the west.
The primary industry is machinery and tools with 69 firms, and the secondary is the metal Industry with 51 firms, both situated in the eastern and western industrial areas.
Other industries such as Lumber/Wood Products, Food, Plastic Products, Apparel/Textiles and Minerals, are also concentrated largely in these industrial areas.
The largest division of Countrywide Home Loans, now Bank of America, Loan Administration, has been headquartered in the city since the mid-1990s. Operating from Madera Road in a building that once housed the apparel company Bugle Boy, the company also has facilities on Tapo Canyon, and First Street. At its height, Countrywide had approximately 10,000 employees in the city.
The Volkswagen of America Design Center was once in an industrial complex across from the Costco wholesale club near Madera and Cochran. The VW Design Center California or DCC, moved to Santa Monica, California in the spring of 2006. Such notable automotive designers as Jay Mays, now (2007) VP Design for Ford and Freeman Thomas, co designer with Jay Mays of the original Audi TT, once called the DCC in Simi Valley their place of work. The original concept for the New Beetle from Jay Mays, had its genesis there.

Top employers.
According to the City's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:
Hazards.
An aspect of Simi Valley's location, situated beside the Simi Hills, is that it lies in a high-risk area for the wildfires that sweep through Southern California's mountain ranges every few years.
Simi Valley is also at risk for earthquakes. The valley is surrounded by earthquake faults; the closest ones being the Santa Rosa Fault to the Northwest, the Northridge Hills Fault to the Northeast, and the Chatsworth Fault to the South. In 1994, portions of Simi Valley received significant damage from the Northridge earthquake.
See Nuclear Accident at SSFL for information on the accident and associated risk(s) to residents.
Wildfires.
Southern California has a high fire risk, due to hot weather and high winds.
A 2005 fire started on September 28 and burned an estimated 7,000 acres (28 km²). On September 29, the fire was estimated to be 17,000 acres (69 km²). More than 1,000 firefighters worked against the tricky combination of dry brush, low humidity and temperatures in the high 90s along the line that divides Los Angeles and Ventura counties. About 45 evacuees gathered at Canoga Park High School in the San Fernando Valley where the Red Cross had set up cots and provided meals. One firefighter was struck on the head by a 40-pound boulder and was taken to a hospital, officials said. The fire was later brought under control and extinguished, without serious injury. Three homes were lost in outlying areas, but none within the city limits.
Education.
Simi Valley is served by the Simi Valley Unified School District (SVUSD).
Simi Valley High School was ranked among MSNBC's Top 1000 High Schools in the country.
Schools of higher education located nearby include Moorpark College, Cal State Northridge, Cal State Channel Islands, California Lutheran University, University of LaVerne, University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), Ventura College, Oxnard College, Eternity Bible College, Louis Brandeis Institute of Justice, Pepperdine University, University of Southern California (USC), Caltech, Valley College, American Jewish University, Loyola Marymount University, University of La Verne, and UCLA.
There are five high schools located in Simi Valley: Royal High School, Grace Brethren High School, Santa Susana High School, Simi Valley High School, and Apollo High School.
There is also one continuation school (Apollo High School, one adult school Simi Adult School and one cosmetology school.
Libraries.
Public Libraries: Simi Valley Public Library: [http://www.simivalleylibrary.org/].
Recreation.
Simi Valley has 20 city parks and five county parks to preserve large swaths of open space in the nearby Santa Susana Mountains, locally known as the "foothills." The city boasts six golf courses and the Kanan Ranch home development has nature trails for hikers, bicyclists and equestrians to enjoy. Two collegiate baseball teams: The Simi Valley Senators and the California Oaks of the California Collegiate League in Thousand Oaks, provide sports action to local fans.
To the East, Rocky Peak has a trail system for Mountain Biking, Hiking and Equestrian activities. The trail is accessed just off the 118 freeway at Kuehner Road, Yosemite Road (about North) or Rocky Peak. Trailheads are: The Hummingbird Trail, Rocky Peak Fire Road or The Chumash Trail. These trails are not recommended for beginners, due to fairly steep grades and some technical sections on the trail. A technical downhill mountain bike run known as the G Spot can be accessed via Rocky Peak Fire Road.
To the West, numerous trails are accessible for Mountain Biking, Hiking and Equestrian activities. The main access point is at the intersection of Wood Ranch Parkway and Long Canyon Parkway. The trail system travels as far west as highway 23, as far east as the Rocketdyne facility and connects to the Lang Ranch trail system (Westlake Village) and Chesebro trail system, which begins in Agoura Hills. Simi Peak (the highest peak in Simi Valley) is accessible from this trail system via China Flats in the Chesebro trail system. Ahmundson Ranch connects to this trail system, again via the Chesebro trail system. Bridlepath, a private trail system also connects to the main fire road.

Bái Tử Long National Park

Bái Tử Long National Park () is a protected area zone in northeastern Vietnam. It was established in 2001, succeeding from the former Ba Mun National Conservation Zone. It is one of seven Vietnamese amphibian national parks which has both terrestrial zone and aquatic zone.
It is located within Bái Tử Long Bay, which with Hạ Long Bay forms an impressive scenery of sea and islands. Including thousands of islands and rocks, they create one of the most beautiful bays in the world.
According to legend, an immense dragon descended to Hạ Long Bay (meaning ‘’Descending Dragon’’) millions years ago, dropping numerous eggs. These eggs hatched forming thousands of rocks and islands. The tail of the dragon extended far to the sea, forming Bạch Long Vĩ island (meaning "The Tail of the White Dragon"). As she returned to heaven, she said good bye to her offspring at the Bái Tử Long Bay (means "The dragon parts the offspring").
Now the Park is part of Vân Đồn District, 20 km distant from Cái Rồng town.
Geography.
The exactly geographical position is in a rectangle between 20°55'05" and 21°15'10" North latitude, 107°30'10" and 107°46'20" East longitude. It administratively consists of 3 communes: Minh Châu, Vạn Yên and Hạ Long of Vân Đồn District.
It is composed from a terrestrial area of 61.25 km2 and an aquatic area of 96.58 km2. The zone includes over 40 islands and rocks. They form three groups : Ba Mùn group, Trà Ngọ group and Sậu group. The aquatic area includes the sea zone between the islands and the narrows between the park area and the land area which has boundary of 1 km offshore.
The National Park also includes a buffer zone of approximately 165.34 km2, which is located in a larger area including 5 communes : Minh Châu, Vạn Yên, Bản Sen, Quan Lạn and Hạ Long. The total population of the core zone and the buffer zone is around 24.000.
Ecosystem.
The National Park includes five kinds of ecosystems : Rain Broad Leaves Forest, Limestone Forest, Littoral Forest, Coral Area and Shallow Water Area.
The Rain Broad Leaves Forest area is mostly secondary forest. The average canopy covers 50 – 90%. 494 species belonging to 337 genera of 117 families have been found in this type of ecosystem. Some endangered species include "Cycas balansae", "Radix marindae officinalis", "Ardisia sylvestris Pitard", "Smilax glabra", Leopard cat ("Prionailurus bengalensis"), Indian muntjac ("Muntiacus muntjak"), Small Indian civet ("Viverricula indica"), Large Indian civet ("Viverra zibetha").
The Limestone Forest area is forest growing in poor soil with particles of limestone on rocky islands. Some rare animals found there include Serow, Rhesus macaque.
The Littoral Ecosystem in the park is small areas surrounding the islands. It has a rather large tidal variation and is biologically highly diverse with 251 species including 19 species of mangrove, 17 species of seaweed, 29 species of marine worms, 149 species of molluscs, 22 species of crustaceans and 15 species of echinoderms.
The Coral area is located from the water depths of low tide to 10m deep. 409 species have been found including groupers, sea bass, crabs, snails, abalone and seaweeds.
The shallow water area covers a large area around the islands, beyond the tidal area and extending from 1 km to around 4 km. These areas have not been profoundly researched but 539 species have been found.

List of Interstate and U.S. Highways in Utah

Three numbered highway systems are present in the U.S. state of Utah: the Interstate Highway System, the United States Numbered Highways system (more commonly known as "U.S. Routes") and the state route system. Both the Interstate and U.S. Highway system are nationwide systems with only a small portion of these routes entering Utah. The Utah Department of Transportation is responsible for maintaining all of the Interstate, U.S. Routes and state highways in the state. Originally, the State Road Commission of Utah, created on March 23, 1909 was responsible for maintenance, but these duties were rolled into the new Department of Transportation in 1975.
There are . of Interstates and U.S. Routes in Utah, comprising of Interstate highways and of U.S. Routes. The longest Interstate is Interstate 15 at and the shortest being Interstate 215 at . The longest U.S. Route is U.S. Route 89 at and the shortest being U.S. Route 89A at .
Five former U.S. Routes exist in the state of Utah, as well as two former interstate highways, all which have been replaced by current interstate and U.S. Routes, with the most recent change being U.S. Route 666 changing to U.S. Route 491 in 2003. One unique former route would be Interstate 415, which was never signed as such, and was only used as a temporary designation for the eastern portion of what is now the Interstate 215 belt loop around Salt Lake City.

Bitto Albertini

Adalberto "Bitto" Albertini (1924–1999) was an Italian film director. He began his film career as a cameraman, and in 1969 he directed "War Devils". In 1974 Albertini directed "Black Emanuelle" starring the then unknown Laura Gemser. Her subsequent successful career meant that she was absent from "Black Emanuelle II", and Albertini instead had to cast actress Sharon Leslie in the title role. The film without Gemser was unsuccessful, and Albertini was ruined.
In 1977 he released "Yellow Emanuelle" as a come back. The film, starring Chai Lee, was very successful. However the film never reached the popularity of Joe D'Amato's series. Albertini was by then an almost forgotten director, his last two films were "Mondo's" set in Asia, depicting socking rituals and savage violence. Bitto is perhaps best remembered for giving the world Laura Gemser.
He died in Rome in 1999 at age 74.

Schöningen Spears

The Schöningen Spears are 8 wooden throwing spears from the Palaeolithic Age, that were found under the management of Dr. Hartmut Thieme from the Lower Saxony State Service for Cultural Heritage (NLD) between 1994 and 1998 in the open-cast lignite mine, Schöningen, county Helmstedt, Germany, together with approx. 16,000 animal bones. More than 300,000 years old, they are the oldest completely preserved hunting weapons in the world and they are regarded as the first evidence of the active hunt by Homo heidelbergensis. These discoveries have permanently changed the picture of the cultural and social development of early humans.
Discovery and location.
The site of the finds (Schöningen 13/II sedimentary sequence 4) is one of 13 Palaeolithic places of discovery in the open-cast lignite mine - working area south - that was excavated in the course of the prospection of the quaternary surface layer from 1992 to 2009.
The 60 m x 50 m excavation base that was excluded from coal mining represents a small segment of a former littoral zone that has been visited over millennia between the Elster- and Saale ice age by humans and animals alike. The pedestal displays five massive layered sediment packages that were created by varying levels of the lake and silting up processes.
Thanks to the quick, airtight covering of the archaeological layers by mud, the organic materials are exceptionally well preserved. In the sequence of the sedimentary layers, climate changes can be read with a high resolution - from a warm, dry phase to airy deciduous forests to tundra.
The spears themselves are from an approx. 10 metres wide and 50 metres long strip parallel to the former lake shore in the sedimentary layer 4, the late Holstein-interglacial. The archaeological layers beneath have only been partially excavated and have been an objective of a research excavation by the DFG (German Research Association) since 2010.
Together with the spears some stone artefacts, chips as well as over 10.000 animal bones were found, amongst them 90% horse bones, followed by red deer and european bison. The horse bones come from Equus mosbachensis and are indicative of at least 20 individuals. They show numerous cut marks made by stone tools, but only a few bite marks made by animals. The site is interpreted by the excavator Harald Thieme as testimony of a hunting event as well as the following cutting up and preparation of the prey. According to his scenario, the thick reeds at the lake shore gave the hunters cover, from where the horses, trapped between hunters and lake, were culled with accurate spear throws. Because there are bones of young animals amongst the horse bones, he concludes that the hunt took place in autumn. Furthermore he sees evidence of ritualistic activity, because the spears were left behind.
Description.
The spears, deformed by the load of the sediment pressure, are made from slim, straight spruce stems – except for spear IV which is made from pine wood. Their dimensions are between 1.8 and 2.5 metres.
They have been worked very thoroughly and are evidence of highly developed technological skills and of workmanlike tradition. Like in today’s tournament javelins, the greatest diameter and therefore its centre of gravity is in the front third of the shaft. The tips are worked symmetrically from the base of the stems, the end of the tips were worked beside the medullary ray, the weakest part of the stem, on purpose.
In their throwing qualities, the wooden Schoeningen spears are equal to today’s tournament javelins. During tests, athletes could throw true to original replicas up to 70 metres. The choice of the wood is likely to be climatically determined, because during the cooler climate near the end of the interglacial, conifers grew close to the site of the finds.
Other discoveries.
More unique wooden artefacts were found at the place of discovery of the wild horse hunting camp: a charred wooden staff (skewer) as well as a wooden tool, tapered at both ends, interpreted as a throwing stick. The stone tools at the place of discovery consist of different scraper-shaped and pointed forms. Evidence of blank production is missing; much retouched debris proves the reworking of the brought-along tools.
Also sensational are the so-called grooved wooden tools, excavated at the place of discovery no. 12. Made from the extremely hard wooden branch-bases of the European silver fir and noticeably incised at one end, they may have been used as a mounting for stone blades. If this interpretation is correct, they are the oldest composite tools of mankind.
Thanks to the good preservation conditions, at the place of discovery there are many finds of small animals, among them small mammals, fish, molluscs and insects. Together with the carpological remains they make a detailed reconstruction of the climate and the environment of the passing of an interglacial possible.
Significance.
The spears and the place of discovery Schoeningen have revolutionized the picture of the cultural and social development of early man. So the widespread research opinion according to which Homo heidelbergensis and even the much younger Neanderthal were primitive beings without language that lived of plants and carrion could be refuted. Because the spears and their correlation of finds are evidence of highly developed technological skills and are the first obvious proof for an active (big game) hunt. A successful hunt for quickly fleeing gregarious animals without sophisticated hunting strategies, a complex social structure and developed forms of communication (language ability) is unthinkable. The Homo heidelbergensis already had intellectual and cognitive skills like anticipatory planning thinking and acting that so far has only been attributed to modern man.
Since 2010, the excavations on top of the excavation base continued in the framework of a project by the Lower Saxony State Service for Cultural Heritage in Hannover and the Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology of the Institute of Pre- and Protohistory and Mediaeval Archaeology, supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Association). Numerous cooperation partners domestic and abroad are involved in the reprocessing and the evaluation of the excavations: Rijksuniversiteit Leiden (Paleontology), Leuphana University Lueneburg (Palynologie), Senckenberg Research Institute and Nature Museum in Frankfurt am Main, Leibniz University Hannover(Geology), Institute for Quaternary Lumbers Langnau (wood anatomy), Romano-Germanic Central Museum Mainz and others.
2009 Lower Saxony allocated public funds from the increased funds for the economy package II for the construction of a research and development centre. The centre, close to the place of discovery, will be devoted to the inter-disciplinary research of the Schoeningen places of discovery as well as to the Pleistocene archaeology and present the original finds in an experience-orientated, modern exhibition. The transparent research and laboratory area as well as an interactive visitor’s laboratory link the areas “research” and “museum”. Environmental habitats will visualize in a 24 hectare outdoor area typical plant communities of the interglacial, among them a pasture for wild horses. The place has been planned as an extracurricular place of learning. Building contractor is the town of Schoeningen. Responsible for the conception and contentual planning is the Lower Saxony State Service of Cultural Heritage. The centre will be opened at the beginning of 2013.
Similar finds.
Wooden artefacts from the Palaeolithic age are very rarely delivered to posterity. Beside Schoeningen, finds are known from Clacton-on-Sea (England), Torralba (Spain), Ambrona (Spain) and Bad Cannstatt (Germany/Baden-Wuerttemberg), where only the wood interpreted as lance fragment from Clacton-on-Sea is preserved. The artefact character of the calcified lumbers from the place of discovery Bilzingsleben is debatable. The wooden stabbing lance from Lehringen, also from Lower Saxony, was found underneath the skeleton of a Straight-tusked Elephant and is aged approximately 125,000 years, so it is much younger. The elephant was possibly killed by it.

The Trust was established in 2002 and aims to restore, protect and sail the three Norfolk trading wherries Hathor, Olive and Norada, and to keep them together as the only fleet of wherries left. 
Hathor was built in 1905 at Reedham, Norfolk for the Colman's Mustard and Boardman families. She was purchased by WYC in 1985, and, after 2 years of restoration work, she was at first used for charter work, but now only for promotional tours, pending an extensive refit.
Norada was built in 1912 at Wroxham and worked as a hire boat until 1950. She was bought in 1964 and underwent extensive restoration. Since 1984 she has been working as a charter boat. As of 2008, Norada is out of the water for restoration of the hull.
Olive was built in 1909 at Wroxham and worked as a hire boat until 1958. She had four more owners until she was restored by the Trust and used for educational charters. In 2005 she sank at her moorings and is awaiting repair and restoration.
The Trust obtained a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to purchase the wherries, to give the public access to the boats, and to run environmental education programmes.

The Battle of the Spoiling Dyke (also known as the Battle of the Spoiled Dyke, Blar Milleadh a’ Ghàraidh, Millegearaidh) was a Scottish clan battle that took place in 1578, fought in the Scottish Highlands, between the MacDonalds of Uist and the Clan MacLeod.
The MacDonalds of Uist barred the doors of Trumpan Church, or Kilconan Church as it was once known, east of the shores of Ardmore Bay. They then set fire to the church full of worshipers. No one escaped alive except one girl who, although mortally wounded, managed to give the alarm. On hearing the news, the chief of Clan MacLeod and his men set off for Ardmore bay where a battle ensued. The MacDonalds were killed almost to a man. The corpses of the MacDonalds were dragged and then buried in a turf dyke, and the incident remembered as the "Battle of the Spoiling Dyke". The by the MacDonalds was to exact vengeance on the MacLeods for their atrocity of the massacre of MacDonalds in the Cave of Frances on the Isle of Eigg a couple of years earlier. This again was a tit-for-tat revenge between the two feuding clans.

<doc id="18593644" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18593644" title="Kindling model">
Kindling model

Kindling is a commonly used model for the development of seizures and epilepsy in which the duration and behavioral involvement of induced seizures increases after seizures are induced repeatedly. The kindling model was first proposed in the late 1960s by Goddard and colleagues. Although kindling is a widely used model, its applicability to human epilepsy is controversial.
Method.
The word "kindling" is a metaphor: the increase in response to small stimuli is similar to the way small burning twigs can produce a large fire. It is used by scientists to study the effects of repeated seizures on the brain. A seizure may increase the likelihood that more seizures will occur; an old saying in epilepsy research is "seizures beget seizures". Repeated stimulation "lowers the threshold" for more seizures to occur.
The brains of experimental animals are repeatedly stimulated, usually with electricity, to induce the seizures. Chemicals may also be used to induce seizures. The seizure that occurs after the first such electrical stimulation lasts a short time and is accompanied by a small amount of behavioral effects compared with seizures that result from repeated stimulations. With further seizures, the accompanying behavior intensifies, for example progressing from freezing in early stimulations to convulsions in later ones. The lengthening of duration and intensification of behavioral accompaniment eventually reaches a plateau after repeated stimulation. Even if animals are left unstimulated for as long as 12 weeks, the effect remains; the response to stimulation remains higher than it had been before.
It has been reported that repeated seizure stimulation can result in spontaneous seizures, but studies have had conflicting findings on this question. In humans, some seizure disorders come to an end by themselves even after large numbers of seizures. However, in both human epilepsy and in some animal models, evidence suggests that a process like that found in kindling does occur.
Historical perspective.
Already in the 1950s and 1960s, numerous authors recognized the seizure-inducing potenital of focal stimulation. Here, Delgado and Sevillano demonstrated that repeated low-intensity stimuli to the hippocampus could lead to progressive increase of electrically evoked seizure activity. Yet, it was not until the late 1960s that Graham Goddard recognized the potential importance of this phenomenon and coined the term 'kindling'. Further research by Goddard on the characteristics of the kindling phenomenon led to his conclusion that kindling can be used to model human epileptogenesis, learning and memory. The publication of these results opened an complerely new niche for epilepsy research and has stimulated a significant amount of studies on the subject of kindling and its relevance to human epilepsy

Vienna 1882 chess tournament

The second international Vienna 1882 chess tournament was one of the longest and strongest chess tournaments ever played. According to the unofficial Chessmetrics ratings, the tournament was (as of March 2005) the strongest tournament in history, on the basis that nine of the ten top players in the world participated, including all of the top eight.
The Vienna Chess Society was formed in October 1857, and this tournament played from 10 May to 24 June 1882 was held on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. The main sponsors were Ignác Kolisch and the club's president Albert Salomon von Rothschild, who together donated 7500 francs to be split over the top six. Franz Joseph I of Austria was the patron of the event, who also donated a special prize of 2000 Austrian Gulden ("Kaiserpreis"). The time control was 15 moves per hour, with a 2 hour break after 4 hours. Games not completed after eight hours of play were adjourned to be finished on the rest day.
The tournament was played as a double round-robin tournament and suffered a number of withdrawals in the second tour. Noa withdrew after the first round of the second tour, Fleissig, Bird, Schwarz and Wittek also lost games by default. The event was won by Wilhelm Steinitz and Szymon Winawer, who decided to share the first prize after they each won a play-off game. The special prize was awarded to Zukertort for the best performance against the top three. On May 12, Steinitz drew a game with Mackenzie, thus ending the longest winning streak in chess history. Steinitz at the time had won 25 consecutive games, the last draw he conceded was nine years earlier, on August 3 in the Vienna 1873 tournament. After this Steinitz would lose three consecutive games to Zukertort, Hruby, and Ware.

USS Baretta (AN-41)

USS "Baretta" (AN-41/YN-60) was an which served with the U.S. Navy in the western Pacific Ocean theatre of operations during World War II. After surviving war action and Pacific Ocean typhoons, and she returned home safely after the war with one battle star to her credit.
Launched in Washington.
The wooden hulled net layer "YN-60" was laid down on 19 December 1942 at Everett, Washington, by the Everett Pacific Shipbuilders and Dry Dock Company; named "Baretta" on 17 March 1943; launched on 9 October 1943; sponsored by Miss Evelyn Jaramo, the 11-year old daughter of a shipfitter at the builder’s yard; reclassified "AN-41" on 20 January 1944; and commissioned at her builder's yard on 18 March 1944, Lt. Comdr. Ravenel L. Collins, USNR, in command.
World War II service.
Assigned to Pacific Ocean operations.
After fitting out, shakedown training out of San Pedro, California, and post shakedown repairs, the net laying ship sailed for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 June. On 20 July, the net layer was ordered to report to the Commander, Service Force, Pacific, for duty "in the forward areas" and loaded mooring and net gear into August.
Sailing in Task Group (TG) 32.6 on 8 August, "Baretta" proceeded to the Solomon Islands and entered Gavutu Harbor near Guadalcanal on the 26th. She remained there until getting underway on 4 September to rejoin Task Group 32.6. After taking position in the convoy, "Baretta" proceeded toward the Palau Islands. The convoy reached Peleliu on 18 September, three days after the initial landings there.
After receiving instructions near Orange Beach, "Baretta" escorted "LST-661" to Kossol Passage, arriving on 22 September. There, she took on board the men and equipment of the fleet post office to be established at Peleliu. Underway again on 24 September, she reached that island later in the day and transferred her passengers to "Leonard Wood" (APA 12) the next morning.
Palau Islands operations.
For the next four months, "Baretta" maintained net defenses in the Palaus. On 26 September, she commenced working on moorings in Saipan Town Harbor, Angaur, but was interrupted by an enemy air raid and, later by worsening seas that made the anchorage unsafe. In the afternoon of 29 September, she received a request for help from "LCT 867", that had fouled a mine with her anchor. "Baretta" proceeded to the scene and stood by while the landing craft carefully cut her anchor cable and then crept away from the peril.
"Baretta" resumed her work on moorings but, on 1 October, worsening weather forced her to stop. In the midst of a moderate gale the next morning, "LCT-404" requested help for an "LCM" whose ramp had jammed in the down position. "Baretta" answered the call, towing the craft alongside stern first, and then into the lee of the island off Red Beach. When the "LCM's" ramp had been freed and secured, the landing craft proceeded under her own power to Red Beach.
Later that day, Baretta retrieved an unmanned "LCVP" adrift in a seaway. She took the landing craft in tow, but the line parted and heavy seas prevented further attempts to salvage the "LCVP". At 1022 on 4 October, "Baretta" was lying off Angaur Island when "LCT-579" struck a mine 300 yards off shore. "Baretta's" motor launch sped to the scene with a rescue party and removed 11 injured men before the damaged craft sank.
Kossol Passage operations.
Through the rest of 1944, "Baretta" repaired and supplied landing craft and helped to retrieve them when they broached or became stranded. After transferring gear on 3 January 1945, "Baretta" sailed to Kossol Passage and, following operations in that vicinity, got underway with "Spangler" (DE 696) on the 10th for the Caroline Islands. A submarine contact on 12 January enlivened the voyage, and a submarine alert soon after "Baretta" entered Ulithi lagoon sent everyone to general quarters before she had moored.
Later that day, "Baretta" sailed for Eniwetok. On the 16th, her crew put out an engine room fire in little more than an hour; but it left her engines inoperable. As a result, "Cliffrose" (AN 42) towed her sister ship for the remainder of the voyage. Arriving on 21 January, "Baretta" spent five days under temporary repair alongside "Oahu" (ARG 5). She got underway under her own power on the 26th and reached Pearl Harbor on 8 February for major repairs which lasted into the spring.
Supporting Guam operations.
The net layer departed Pearl Harbor on 16 April and proceeded via Eniwetok to Guam, arriving at Apra Harbor on 3 May. After discharging her cargo, "Baretta" reported to the Commander, Forward Area, Pacific, for temporary duty and sailed for Ulithi to relieve "Viburnum" (AN-57) that had been damaged by a mine. "Baretta" reached Ulithi on the 7th and, for the next three weeks, operated on the main net line there, "upending, repairing, and replacing the anti-torpedo panels." She devised a new method of handling the nets, which both saved time and reduced the possibility of damage to the buoys. "The new overlap method," according to her war diary, "proved quick and safe."
"Baretta" worked at Ulithi into late June, retrieving, rigging, and laying anti-torpedo net moorings, until getting underway for the Ryukyus on 28 June in a 16 ship convoy. Detached on 4 July when five miles west of the southern tip of Okinawa, "Baretta" proceeded independently to Kerama Retto to relieve "Terebinth" (AN 59). She and her sister ships then recovered the anchor legs of the fleet telephone moorings in Kerama Retto for transfer to Buckner Bay. Before proceeding to that place, "Baretta" assisted LCT-466 that had lost her ramp and taken a 10 degree list to starboard. "Baretta" built a wooden jury ramp, repaired the tank landing craft's leaking starboard ballast tank and shifted the cargo load to port.
Okinawa operations.
The next afternoon, "Baretta" moved to the anchorage at Unten Ko, off northeastern Okinawa where she was protected from a raging typhoon. By the 21st, the storm had abated and finally "Baretta" moved to Buckner Bay. Upkeep and logistics occupied her for about a week. Then she joined "Stagbush" (AN-69) and "Winterberry" (AN-56), and together they laid the fleet telephone moorings in Buckner Bay on 27 and 28 July.
On 1 August 1945, another typhoon forced her to seek shelter again. Underway at 0700, "Baretta" raced up the east coast of Okinawa, battered by a strong wind from the northeast. She rolled 30 degrees to each side before reaching the relatively tranquil waters of Katena Ko, a typhoon anchorage two miles south of Unten Ko. "Baretta" rode out the blow "anchored bow and stern with two auxiliary minesweepers tied alongside."
Salvaging a Japanese midget submarine.
After the storm passed, she proceeded with "Catclaw" (AN 60) to Uten Ko where they salvaged a Japanese midget submarine. "Baretta" returned to Buckner Bay on the 11th and, the next day, commenced net maintenance work south of the entrance gate at Buckner Bay. At 1700 on the afternoon of 14 August, all minecraft were "directed to be prepared for departure on one hour's notice." At 0800 the next morning, "Baretta" was proceeding to the net line when she received word by radio notifying "...all ships present that Japan's surrender had been officially accepted and all offensive action was to cease."
End-of-war operations.
To prepare for the occupation of Japan, paths through the mine strewn approaches to the ports of debarkation had to be cleared. Such an effort required the support of ships like "Baretta". On 4 September, the net layer proceeded to Unten Ko to load navigational gear to be used in marking the Kii Suido channel off the port of Wakayama. There she took on concrete "clump" anchors and navigational buoys before loading additional equipment at Buckner Bay.
She reached the entrance to Kii Suido at noon on 11 September and stood into Wakayama in the wake of the second sweep unit. Two hospital ships and a U.S. 5th Fleet task group followed. The next morning, "Fraser" (DM 24) and "Stagbush" began laying channel buoys. "Baretta" later joined them, planting buoys at three mile intervals. Each of the net layers received a "well done" from "Fraser".
Surviving in a typhoon.
On the evening of the 16th, weather reports warned of an approaching typhoon; and, at 0920 on the 17th, "all ships received orders to be ready to get underway on 30 minutes notice." After letting out more anchor chain, "Baretta" waited as the wind increased to force 6 by 1800. Dragging anchor, "LCI-814" fouled the net layer's bow at 1855. "Baretta" backed down and released more chain, enabling the landing craft to free herself.
During the night, the wind velocity increased until, at 0100 on the 18th, "Baretta" clocked it at between 81 and 89 knots. Yard and landing craft in her vicinity continually dragged anchors, but "Baretta's" bow anchor held. By 0730, the wind quieted to 30 knots, and "Baretta" headed for the lee of Awajii Island to avoid heavy swells coming from the northeast.
The storm abated that afternoon, and "Baretta" returned to Wakanoura Wan and surveyed the devastation: three "LST's" and a "YMS" lay stranded on the northern beaches of the anchorage and a PBY "Catalina" seaplane had been sunk. On the 19th, the net layer replanted a mid channel radar buoy in Kii Suido which the typhoon had dragged some 500 yards away from its original position.
A gift of 30 cases of beer.
An unusual assignment came next. While entering Kii Suido on 22 September, the battleship "California" (BB 44) had snagged a channel buoy in her streamed paravanes, taking it with her some 25 miles before she anchored. "Baretta" recovered the "kidnapped" buoy and received, in compensation, "thirty cases of beer from the BB..."
"Baretta" spent the rest of the year laying and replanting buoys around the Ryukyus and in the Japanese home islands. She departed Japan on 29 December and proceeded via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor to the California coast.
Post-war inactivation and disposal.
"Baretta" underwent pre-inactivation overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard and was decommissioned there on 4 April 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 May 1946, but her ultimate fate remains obscure. One source indicates that she was acquired by Mr. O. Clive Webster, of Bermuda, on 20 January 1947. Yet, another suggests that she was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission and gives 24 January 1947 as the date on which that occurred. To add to the mystery, merchant registers do not mention the ship in their postwar issues.

Andrea Catellani

Andrea Catellani (born May 26, 1988) is an Italian football player, who currently plays for Spezia Calcio in the Italian Serie B.
Club career.
Catania.
Catellani began his career in the youth ranks of Catania, before being sold to Reggiana in a co-ownership deal in June 2006. During the 2006–2007 Serie C1 season, Catellani scored 10 goals in just 15 league appearances; overall, his performances included 77 league appearances and 15 league goals for the Italian side. In the summer of 2008 Catania opted to sign the player back on a permanent basis.
He was officially brought back to Catania in July 2008 following the resolution of his co-ownership with Lega Pro side Reggiana. The transfer fee was undisclosed. After spending the summer training and taking part in first-team friendlies, the young striker was loaned out to Serie B outfit, Modena to gain experience. In his first Serie B season with Modena, Catellani made 25 league appearances, scoring 7 goals. He was included in the starting line-up on 18 occasions. After an impressive season for the young striker up north in Modena, it was believed that he would return to Catania and remain for the 2009-10 Serie A campaign, with the player also impressing during the pre-season. He was given the shirt number 11. However, on 29 August 2009 it was confirmed that the young striker would return to Modena for one more season of first team football. He made an additional 35 appearances for the Serie B club, scoring 9 goals in his second term.
In June 2010, the player again returned to Catania, upon the expiration of the loan deal. After training with the club's first team during the 2010 pre-season, and also taking part in pre-season friendlies, new head coach, Marco Giampaolo opted to send the player out on loan once more. Catellani officially was loaned out to Serie B side Sassuolo on 1 August 2010, joining former Catania teammate Mauro Minelli. During his loan at Sassuolo he scored just 4 goals in 33 Serie B appearances. On 30 June 2011, Catellani officially returned to Catania, and on 9 July 2011, Catellani was assigned the number 32 jersey. In his first full season with the Sicilian club, Catellani appeared most frequently as a substitute, scoring 1 Serie A goal in 21 league appearances. On 30 August 2012, Catellani was signed on a season-long loan deal by Sassuolo for the second time, after he had previously spent the 2010-11 Serie B campaign, also on loan.
Spezia.
On 23 August 2013, he officially transferred to Spezia in a co-ownership deal.

Lady Arundel's Manchet

Lady Arundel's Manchet is a traditional version of a manchet, a traditional English yeast bread from Sussex.
The recipe for Lady Arundel's Manchet was first published in 1653 according to Elizabeth David. It was a luxurious bread eaten by the medieval aristocracy and remained popular into the Restoration period. A recipe appears in "A True Gentlewoman's Delight" (1653) printed for the Countess of Kent.
Lady Arundel's Manchets crossed the Atlantic to Virginia with the early colonists according to Katherine E Harbury.
Florence White also references Lady Arundel's Manchet's in her 1932 English Cookery book "Good Things in England", publishing a description of a 1676 recipe and updating it for a contemporary readership.
Manchets were often used as part of other dishes. For example, a recipe for a baked pudding that incorporates manchet is included in "Things Not Generally Known, Familiarly Explained," citing The Queene's Royal Cookbook of 1713. This is a rich pudding that includes double cream, the addition of beef suet and added aromatics such as nutmeg, cinnamon and rose water.
Lady Arundel's Manchets are rarely made today. Manchets generally ceased to appear in English cookery books after 1800. The closest similar yeast bread is probably a Bath bun or a Sally Lunn bun.

Edward E. Rice

Edward Everett Rice (1847–1924) was an American musical composer and theater producer active during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, known primarily for being a pioneer of American musical theater and introducing to Broadway a musical by African-American writers and performers.
Biography.
Living in New York City in the early 1870s, Rice was employed as a clerk with the Cunard Steamship Company when he saw the English production of "The Black Crook" and became interested in the idea of creating an American musical. In 1874 Rice and John Cheever Goodwin were the creators of "Evangeline", an extravaganza and burlesque show that became the first American production billed as musical comedy. Rice composed the music for more than eighteen productions that appeared on Broadway, including "Hiawatha" and "Summer Nights", that toured the country. Rice had no formal musical education and he could not read sheet music, but he had considerable raw talent playing by ear on the piano. His method of composition would be to "dictate" to a scribe tunes that he would play on the piano, and he would make suggestions for orchestration.
As a producer, Rice introduced popular performers Pauline Hall, Lillian Russell, and Fay Templeton, and in 1898, he booked "" by Will Marion Cook and Paul Laurence Dunbar, one of the earliest musicals by African Americans and the first to appear on Broadway at the prestigious Casino Theatre. Rice's biggest hit was 1894's "Adonis", which starred Henry Dixey, one of the most popular performers of the era. He produced the "burlesque extravaganza" musical "1492 Up To Date" in 1893 in New York City. Rice's final Broadway production was a 1904 revival of the British musical "Mr. Wix of Wickham", with new songs by Jerome Kern. He died 16 November 1924 in New York City.
Genealogy and family relations.
Edward E. Rice's first cousin Edmund Rice was a brigadier general and Medal of Honor awardee. Rice was a direct descendant of Edmund Rice, an English immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony, as follows:

<doc id="18593771" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18593771" title="David Braham">
David Braham

David Braham (1834 – April 11, 1905) was a London-born musical theatre composer most famous for his work with Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart. He is considered as "the American Offenbach".
Early life (1834–1873).
David Braham was born in London in 1834. As a young man, he aspired to become a professional musician and began studying the harp. However, because he was unable to get his bulky instrument on board a stagecoach, he later switched to the violin. He proved to be an adept violinist, performing in concerts at a young age.
The Braham family immigrated to New York City when David was 15. Upon arriving in New York, Braham began working as a violinist in the orchestra accompanying the Pony Moore Minstrels. He also played in the pit orchestras of various New York auditoriums and led a military band.
The first Broadway musical to feature music by David Braham was "Pluto", produced by William Horace Lingard at the Theatre Comique in 1869. Braham's success as a composer continued through the early 1870s, during which time he wrote numbers for such performers as James McKee, then-child star Annie Yeamans, and P. T. Barnum performer Major Tom Thumb.
Harrigan and Hart (1873–1885).
In 1873, David Braham collaborated with Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart on the song "The Mulligan Guard", with music by Braham and lyrics by Harrigan. The song was presented on July 15, 1873 as part of a vaudeville sketch which featured Harrigan and Hart wearing unusual American Civil War-era military costumes.
This collaboration marked the first of many between Braham, Harrigan, and Hart. From that point onwards, Braham became firmly associated with the two. Although he did go on to write melodies for other lyricists, his success in Broadway theater came almost entirely as a result of his Harrigan and Hart scores. In November 1876, Harrigan married Braham's daughter Annie.
The success of "The Mulligan Guard" led to a series of burlesques which would become known as the "Mulligan plays". The Mulligan plays focused on the everyday life of New York City, appealing to a variety of racial groups, including Irish Americans, German Americans, and African Americans.
The first of these Mulligan plays was "The Mulligan Guard's Ball", followed by "The Mulligan Guard's Picnic", "The Mulligan Guard's Chowder", "The Mulligan Guard's Christmas", and various others. Although most of the Mulligan plays followed the same naming pattern, the final two shows in the series were titled "Cordelia's Aspirations" and "Dan's Tribulations". The Mulligan plays featured several popular songs, all of which were written by Braham, including "The Pitcher of Beer" and "Hats Off to Me".
Late life (1884–1905).
The last Mulligan play to be produced was "Dan's Tribulations" on April 7, 1884. Shortly after it opened, the New Theatre Comique, at which many of the Harrigan and Hart shows had been produced, burned down. In 1885, Harrigan and Hart separated, and neither they nor Braham were ever able to singularly attain the same level of success that they had achieved as a team.
David Braham died in 1905. On May 21, 1906, Harrigan produced a revival of "Old Lavender", a musical he and Braham had written together. In 1985, a musical titled "Harrigan 'n Hart" was produced at the Longacre Theatre, featuring songs by Harrigan and Braham.

Club career.
Early career.
Born in, Aldao, Argentina, Di Cosmo began his career in the youth sector of Almirante Brown in Argentina, before transferring to A.C.S.D. Saluzzo in Italy in the summer of 2006. With Saluzzo, Di Cosmo managed 6 goals in 15 appearances for the fifth-tier Italian side, before being sold to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione outift Igea Virtus prior to the 2007-08 Lega Pro season. He scored 16 league goals in 31 appearances for the Sicilian outfit, winning the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione "Capocannoniere" (top scorer) that season for his "Girone." His performances were often eye-catching, thus impressing scouts of several Serie A and Serie B teams.
Calcio Catania.
Di Cosmo officially transferred to Calcio Catania in July 2008, although he was swiftly loaned out to Lega Pro Prima Divisione side, Paganese Calcio. He managed another 9 goals in 18 league appearances for the Italian side, before returning to Catania once again on 30 June 2009.
Colligiana.
On 31 August 2009, the final day of the Italian summer transfer window, Di Cosmo was sold permanently to Tuscan Lega Pro Seconda Divisione outfit, V.F. Colligiana, without making a single appearance for Catania during his stint with the club.
Di Cosmo ironically formed an offensive partnership at Colligiana with former Catania teammate Christian Ianelli, and scored 9 goals in 22 league appearances during the 2009-10 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione season.
Return to South America.
Following the 2009-10 season, Di Cosmo returned to South America, with Bolivian side, The Strongest, where he competed in the Liga de Fútbol Profesional Boliviano, and scored 11 goals in 34 league appearances. After just one season, he transferred out of Bolivia altogether, joining Angostura F.C. of Venezuela in 2011. His move was very short-lived, however, as he transferred to Peruvian outfit, FBC Melgar on 31 December 2011, after just 4 goals and 12 appearances in the Venezuelan Primera División. With Melgar, Di Cosmo earned a starting shirt once again, making 41 league appearances and scoring 11 goals in the process. On 31 December 2012, after just one year in the Peruvian Primera División, Di Cosmo returned to Bolivia with Oriente Petrolero on a free transfer. He has since scored 3 goals in 19 league appearances for his club.

Battle of Traigh Ghruinneart

The Battle of Traigh Ghruinneart or in Scottish Gaelic Blàr Tràigh Ghruineart or sometimes called the Battle of Gruinart Strand was a Scottish clan battle fought on 5 August 1598, on the Isle of Islay, in the Scottish Highlands. It was fought between the Clan Donald and Clan Maclean. A "tràigh" or stand is the flat area of land bordering a body of water, a beach, or shoreline.
History.
The Isle of Islay had belonged to Clan MacDonald. The clan chief was Sir James MacDonald, 9th of Dunnyveg, nephew of Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean. Maclean demanded that the island belonged to his clan.
After assembling his forces of about 800 to 1,000 men, Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean landed at Loch Ghruinneart. James being reasonable peacefully offered his uncle half of the island for the MacLeans to own for Lauchlan's lifetime only. MacLean refused all offers of peace unless his nephew gave him the entire Island. Allies to the Clan MacDonald sent men from Kintyre and Arran, including members of Clan MacAlister, which were led by Angus MhicMhuirich of Arran. 
James MacDonald had fewer troops available but they were well trained. His forces feigned retreat toward the setting sun then turned around to fight with the sun in the eyes of their enemy. The MacDonalds were victorious and the MacLeans were defeated.
A dwarf named Dubh Sith (Black Fairy) was hidden in a tree and he killed Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean with a shot through his eye after he had removed his helmet.
With Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean and about 280 of his men killed in battle, the rest were chased to their boats and some sought refuge in the chapel of Kilnave. The chapel was burnt down, killing all but one of the men inside. 
Sir James MacDonald was seriously wounded after being shot through the body with an arrow. He was found after the battle amongst the dead MacDonalds, which also included Angus MhicMhuirich of Arran. About 30 MacDonalds were slain and 60 wounded.
Afterwards James VI and I, the King of Scotland, awarded MacDonald lands to Clan Campbell, leading to an extension of the feud. 
Clan MacDonald's reign in Islay came to an end in 1612 when Angus MacDonald, 8th of Dunnyveg, sold his land holdings to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor of Clan Campbell of Cawdor.

Ribeira Brava, Cape Verde

The city of Ribeira Brava (colloquially known in Cape Verdean Creole as Stanxa) is the city that constitutes the seat of the Ribeira Brava Municipality in the island of São Nicolau, Cape Verde. The name Ribeira Brava is Portuguese for "rough streams". It takes its name from several 'rough' streams or floods that occur yearly in the Ribeira Brava valey as rain water from the surrounding mountains violently pours down into the dry river-bed. This name however shares a historical link to the municipality of Ribeira Brava, in the Portuguese Autonomous Region of Madeira which shares similar geological resemblance.
The city is sandwiched between two mountains, Monte Fora to the north and Caleijão mountains to the south, while under the shadow of the imposing Mountain of Monte Gordo in the west. The streets and buildings of Ribeira Brava stretches hundreds of metres within the valley. Though only officially elevated to the status of a city in 2010, Ribeira Brava serves as the center of business and trade for the surrounding areas from the beginning of its founding, in the 17th Century. Its population is 4,982. It is among the oldest towns of Cape Verde and was for many years the seat of the Roman Catholic Church in the archipelago. The city has a colonial look with Portuguese style buildings, charming parks and gardens, small winding streets, and steep hills with stunning views. Ribeira Brava is linked with roads to Tarrafal de São Nicolau on the southwestern part of the island, south to its nearest port Campo and to the eastern half of the island as well. The city was founded in the sixteenth century after locals settled here to escape continuous pirate attacks by the likes of Sir Francis Drake. Ribeira Brava is famous for being the bedrock of Cape Verdean intellect in the 19th century as there you find the famous Seminário Liceu São José which for many years was the center of higher education in the archipelago.
Ribeira Brava has a school or collegiate ("colegio"), a lyceum (middle school), a gymnasium (secondary school), a primary school, and two kindergartens. Additionally the town has churches, a nearby airport (located south between Ribeira Brava and Preguiça), a post office, and various banks. The town also features a few squares ("praças") that form centers of social life, gossiping, and exchange of information for the locals.
The city also has:
- 5 bakeries,
- 2 gas-stations, 
- 1 post office
- 1 general hospital
- 1 pharmacy
- 1 municipal (soccer) stadium, and two gyms (ginásio)
- a high school, a primary school, and 2 kinder-gardens
- 2 youth organizations

GK Dürnrohr

The GK Dürnrohr (German abbreviation for Gleichstromkurzkupplung Dürnrohr, in English meaning Dürnrohr HVDC-Back-to-Back Station) was a high-voltage direct current back-to-back scheme west of Dürnrohr substation, which was used for the energy exchange between Austria and Czechoslovakia between 1983 and 1996. The installation is no longer in use.
The GK Dürnrohr had a nominal transmission rating of 550 MW. The nominal value of the DC voltage in the intermediate circuit was 145 kV. The transmission losses of the facility were 1.4%.
History.
Planning and construction.
The planning of GK Dürnrohr was started in 1975, after a contract between Austria and Poland was agreed on concerning electric power exchange by a power line running over Czechoslovakia. Construction work at the facility started at the end of 1980. In the middle of 1983, the station started its service. After June 1983, the first experimental energy exchange with Czechoslovakia took place.
Decommissioning.
After the synchronisation of electricity grids of West and Eastern Europe on 17 October 1995, the plant remained in operation until 31 October 1996, as Austria has no large 380 kV-grids, which is in contrast to Germany. However, afterwards in Poland, some power stations were equipped with an efficient frequency regulation device; the power grids of the Czech Republic and Austria could be done interconnected directly without using a HVDC-interconnection. The high voltage switchgears were used in Vienna Southeast Substation and in Southern Burgenland, like the transformers, which had to be modified for a secondary voltage of 110 kV.
The obsolescence of the HVDC back-to-back station allowed an increase of the maximum power transmission rate between Dürnrohr and Slavetice to 1386 MW. By the exchange of some coils of the PLC-facility the transmission capacity could be increased to 1481 MW.
The installation of the second 380 kV circuit on the pylons of the Dürnrohr-Slavetice powerline in 2008, for which they are already designed at time of construction, doubled this value to 2962 MVA.
The originally planned selling of the facility to Eastern Europe for an HVDC-back-to-back station never took place; such a transaction would have served as an interconnection between the power grids of Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union. In 2007, the remaining parts of the facility were dismantled. The valve hall is used today by the former operator Verbund AG for operational uses.
Rooms and equipment.
Valve hall.
The static inverter of the plant is situated in a reinfrorced concrete building that is 29.8 meters long, 15.4 meters large, and 13.8 meters high; at both long sides, there are two bays for the static inverter transformers. For protection against fire, the walls of the static inverter hall, which have a strength of 20 centimeters, were equipped with stone wool insulation. The entire building is covered with a zinc-coated sheet, which serves as an electrical shielding and enclosure.
The static inverter hall also has a cellar, in which the air conditioning system, the water cooling system, and the water treatment plant are installed. At the western end to the narrow side of the static inverter hall, there is the equipment building. In the equipment building, there are battery and electric rectifier rooms, storage and test equipment rooms, and the ventilation devices for the air conditioning system, along with an auxiliary control room. A window consisting of three glasses, which cannot be opened, allows a view from the equipment building to the valves of the static inverter. At the eastern end to the narrow side, there is a smoothing coil.
Transformer.
On both sides of the static inverter, there are two three-phase transformers, each dimensioned for a power of 335 MVA with a nominal winding ratio of 400 to 63.
Static inverter.
The static inverter, which is implemented as a twelve-pulse inverter, uses for each valve function a serial switch of 44 thyristors with a maximum blockade voltage of 4.2 kV and a maximum nominal DC current rating of 3790 A. The total number of thyristors used in the facility is 1056. The thyristors had a wafer diameter of 100 mm during construction and were, at the time, the largest thyristors of the world.
Each static inverter consist of three thyristor towers, which are housed in the static inverter hall. Each thyristor tower contains a complete twelve-pulse branch of the static inverter. In these thyristor towers, for each valve function, four thyristor modules are used, which are arranged in two floors. Between the thyristor modules of a floor, there is a coil with an iron core. Parallel to the thyristor modules of a floor, there is a capacitator. Parallel to each valve function, there is a surge arrester in the form of a varistor.
Each thyristor module consists of a connection of 11 thyristors, to which there are parallel connections from a capacitaor and a resistor. The energy for the steering circuits of the thyristors is taken from the capacitator and resistor. As the thyristors and their steering electronics are on high voltage potential, the transmission of the ignition impulses from the control electronic on ground potential takes place via fibreoptical cables. A second optical waveguide cable allows the transmission of data from the thyristor module to the main control electronics on ground potential. A programmable controller of the system SIMATIC S5 is used for controlling this system.
The thyristors and the coils switched with them are cooled with deionozed water, which circulates in a closed cycle. The developed heat is delivered to a second cycle, in which there is a mixture of glycol and water. Over evaporation radiators, the heat of this cycle is transferred to the environment. For maintenance purposes, dedicated modules are exchanged against intact modules and carried in the repair and inspection room. For this, a telescope-lifting platform and a crane are installed in the static inverter hall.
Smoothing coil.
At the eastern side of the static inverter hall, there is a smoothing coil with an iron core of 85 mH. It was built by the company ELIN and is, as the high-voltage transformers, oil-cooled.
AC filters.
As AC-fiters, four resonance circuits are installed on both sides of the plant. Each of the filters consist of a series-connection of a two-microfarad capacitator with a coil to which a 615 ohm resistor is parallelized. One filter on each side uses a 41 mH air-core coil, while the other has a 29 mH air-core coil. On each power exit, there is also a bank of capacitors for reactive power compensation. The capacitors' values are two microfarads for the exit of the line toward Czech Republic and one microfarad for the exit toward Austria.
SVC-Compensator.
The SVC-facility remained in service after the shut-down of the HVDC back-to-back station. It consists of two groups of single-phase coils with an inductivity of 86 mH, which are fed via a tertiary winding on the 380 kV/220 kV-transformers with a voltage of 30 kV and which can deliver a maximum reactive power of 200 MVar. The first coil group went into service in 1982, the second in 1986.
Power line to Czech Republic.
The long powerline to Slavetice substation in Czech Republic is a double-circuit 380 kV-line. However the second circuit was installed in 2008. In the Czech Republic, two-level conductor arrangement is used, while in Austria three-level conductor arrangement is used. The line crosses the border near Kleinhaugsdorf. When built, it was the first electrical power intercoonection between the synchronous grid of Continental Europe and the Interconnected Power System of the Eastern block.

Sir Henry Martin, 2nd Baronet

Sir Henry William Martin, 2nd Baronet (20 December 1768 - 3 February 1842) was an English amateur cricketer.
Martin was born on 20 December 1768 at Bishopstown, County Cork, Ireland. He was the eldest surviving son of the naval officer, Henry Martin, naval officer, and was the elder brother of naval officer Thomas Byam Martin.
Cricket career.
Martin was an English amateur cricketer who made 7 known appearances in first-class cricket matches from 1797 to 1813 as well as numerous appearances in other significant matches. His name is given as ""Marten"" in most if not all cricket sources. Martin was mainly associated with Surrey and was a member of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Sir Henry died on 3 February 1842 at his house in Upper Harley Street, London.
British West Indies.
Of a family long resident in Antigua and Montserrat his 271-page "Travel journal of Sir H. W. Martin" is in the manuscripts collection of the British Library and many pages are displayed online by the British Library, external link below.
Auctioneer's description: "Fine and extensive journal of Sir Henry Martin of Harley Street, London, chronicling his visit to the West Indies between 1836 and 1837, a detailed manuscript journal, closely written on 271 pages, with one pencil sketch showing a group of carts crossing a bridge, bound in marbled boards, 8vo A highly important account by a high status visitor to the West Indies at a very early date. Martin appears to be a very meticulous individual, with an eye for minute detail throughout his journey in every degree, making this an invaluable record not only of the West Indies, but also the general conditions in every place he visited, including the U.K. For example, he leaves Piccadilly in December 1836 via the Herald Coach to Falmouth noting, "Passage money inside £4:5:0, outside £2:5:0 - I had three enquiries made at the coach office on different days to ascertain the exact time that the coach got into Falmouth for the purpose of ordering dinner or not ...". He then notes in great detail the time taken to reach Falmouth. He leaves Piccadilly at 9.47am, reaching Bagshot at 53 minutes past noon, for example. He and his family (with servant) leave Falmouth on board the Mutine, the passage for all costing £38. On board are a group of Cornish miners going to Cuba on a mining scheme. During the journey, he logs latitudes and longitudes for the entire passage, and details the day to day happenings on the vessel. The family reach the West Indies the following February and the journal is equally detailed about the topography and general social conditions which Martin observes. For example, he says of Martinique, "There are here many excellent shops, which would not disgrace Paris, and many private houses three storeys high and from four to six windows in line, chiefly I think built of stone ... we went to a hotel (as it's called) kept by a mulatto woman called Parker, a native of Barbados and well known to all naval persons who have been here of late years - I think she must be nearly 60 but she looks very much younger. She is quite a character and a very shrewd one too ...". This is an invaluable insight into the early 19th century, which deserves considerable research. "

William Capel (sportsman)

The Honourable & Reverend William Robert Capel (1775–1854), sportsman, Vicar of Watford, Hertfordshire, Rector of Raine, Essex, and a chaplain-in-ordinary to HM Queen Victoria.
Family.
Capel, was born 28 April 1775 in England third son of the 4th Earl of Essex and his second wife, Harriet Bladen. The Capel Earls of Essex were seated at Cassiobury Park, Watford, Hertfordshire and subsequently elected to spell their family's surname Capell.
He married 7 June 1802, Sarah, daughter of T Samuel Salter, brewer of Moneyhill House, Rickmansworth and they had three sons and four daughters. He died 3 December 1854 at Watford, Hertfordshire.
Clerical career.
Capel was appointed vicar of Watford, Hertfordshire on 8 June 1799 and rector of Raine, Essex on 30 January 1805, both in the gift of the Earl of Essex.
In 1829 it appeared to the new Bishop of London, of his own knowledge, that the ecclesiastical duties of the vicarage and parish church of Watford were inadequately performed, by reason of the vicar's negligence. After three months without the instructed appointment being made by Capel the Bishop appointed a curate with a stipend. Capel refused to allow the curate to officiate and the stipend was not paid. "Capel resisted stoutly, and on one occasion the rector and the curate had a race for the reading-desk in church".
In 1832 the dispute was brought to the Hertfordshire Assizes. Bishop Blomfield's, very expensive, case was lost on a technicality. Capel v. Child (2C. & J. 558) 
A few years afterwards Blomfield came down from London to preach a charity sermon at Watford, and was Capel's house-guest. Capel "came down to breakfast in an old grey dressing gown and red slippers, much to the surprise and something to the discomfiture of his Diocesan". Asked, before the event, by a close friend how he had managed to have his invitation accepted Capel's reply was said to have been: "How, why I gave him a good licking and that made him civil. We are very good friends now."
In 1895 Capel's great granddaughter, Muriel Granville, married Blomfield's grandson, Frederick Charles Blomfield!
Cricket.
Capel was a keen sportsman, principally associated with fox-hunting and cricket. He played cricket as an amateur and made 1 known appearance in first-class cricket in 1808. His recorded career in significant matches ran from 1796 to 1809. Capel was a member of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and of Homerton Cricket Club. He was a distant kinsman of the more famous cricketer Martin Bladen Hawke.
Foxhunting.
Capel was an enthusiastic foxhunter as master of the Old Berkeley fox-hounds with kennels at Gerrards Cross.
Landmark foxhunting court case.
The rights of property owners: The Earl of Essex v. The Hon. and Rev. W. Capel.
In 1808 a public meeting of Noblemen Gentlemen and Farmers at Stanmore, chaired by the Earl of Essex, discussed the activities of the Berkeley hounds in the vicinity of the metropolis. 
In 1809 the Old Berkeley hunted a fox into the Essex estate and Capel with a follower jumped locked gates smashing the top rail of a fence. The Earl of Essex, his brother, George, thereupon sued him for trespass. The case was heard before Lord Ellenborough, Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench, at the Hertford Assizes 24 July 1809 and reported in The Times of 26 July 1809.
The defendants, the members of the hunt, claimed the right of pursuit of their game over every man's enclosure . . . unless the law allowed them to do so, it would wholly destroy the manly exercise of the chase.
Evidence was given that Holingshead, his Lordship's keeper, had been asked not to destroy foxes and told he would be sent a barrel of ale to drink success to the Berkeley Hunt.
Lord Ellenborough decided the only question on the record was whether the defendants pursued the game with the sole view of extirpating noxious animals or with the desires of sportsmen. 
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and it was agreed to take similar verdicts in other actions.

Shipfitter

A shipfitter is a marine occupational classification used both by naval activities and among ship builders; however, the term applies mostly to certain workers at commercial and naval shipyards during the construction or repair phase of a ship.
The term is derived from the words "ship" and "fit" -- essentially, "fitting" parts of the "ship" together.
Naval usage.
A shipfitter is an enlisted or civilian person who works on heavy metal like high-tensile steel, high yield strength steel, etc.
Shipfitters fabricate, assemble and erect all structural parts of a ship, coordinate all fixed tank work performed on submarines and ships, and coordinate all sonar dome work. Shipfitters also use heavy machinery such as plate planners, shears, punches, drill presses, bending rolls, bending slabs, plate beveler, saws, presses up to 750 tons, angle roll (vertical and horizontal), dogs and wedges. Shipfitters are responsible for hydro and air testing of tanks and compartments as well as perform grinding, drilling, and fit up operations on submarines and surface crafts.
Ship builder usage.
A shipfitter is a worker who “fits” together the structural portions of a ship by either welding or by riveting.

Young Australia League

The Young Australia League (Inc) (Y.A.L.) is an Australian youth organisation which was formed in Perth, Western Australia in 1905 by Jack Simons and Lionel Boas. Developed as a means to encourage nationalism and patriotic values, the organisation organises activities and the ideals of "Education through Travel", the aims of its founders.
History.
Simons was secretary of the Western Australian Football League (WAFL) between 1905 and 1914, and believed that the encroachment of soccer, rugby and other "non-Australian" sports was threatening the game of Australian rules football. Along with several prominent Western Australians including Lionel Boas, the Young Australia Football League was formed in 1905 as a development organisation for football in Western Australia. The League organised intra- and interstate tours for young Western Australian football players to promote the Australian rules football code as part of a broader nationalist agenda. Other people involved with the establishment of the League were prominent Western Australian artists H. H. Eastcourt and Arthur Clarke, and noted Victorian artist Robert Prenzel. 
Shortly afterward, the YAFL changed its name to 'Young Australia League', and its activities were diversified to include literature, debating, band music, sport and theatrical performances, as well as outdoor pursuits such as hiking and camping. Setting its activities mainly for boys, the League promoted a philosophy of development of Australian nationalism with the aim of becoming the 'largest boys club in the British Empire'. In 1909 the League had its first of many interstate tours, with early overseas tours conducted in 1911, 1914, 1925 and 1929.
After World War I, branches were established in other states along similar lines to the Perth organisation.
Simons, who had extensive publishing interests, died in 1945. Four years prior, he assigned his interest in Western Press to Y.A.L., giving the League a bequest of $50,000.
The League continued but is now only operational in Western Australia. Due to declining funds, Araluen had fallen into disrepair by 1985 and was sold to the Government of Western Australia. Since 1990 it has been run as a not-for-profit volunteer organisation, responsible for the Park's restoration, preservation and development.
In Simon's lifetime, an estimated 50,000 people participated in the well-known Y.A.L. travel tours around the world.
Boas was president of the League for forty years, until his death in 1949.
Facilities.
The League's headquarters are at 45 Murray Street, at the corner of Irwin Street, Perth; a heritage listed building which was built in 1924 to accommodate clubrooms and administration. The foyer houses an extensive museum of memorabilia associated with the League's early years.
'Camp Simons' is a YAL operated youth camp set in bushland not far from Araluen, and about 3 km from Canning Dam. It has accommodation and facilities for about 200 people.

Trimeresurus kanburiensis

Trimeresurus kanburiensis is a species of pit viper found in only a few areas of Thailand. Highly venomous, it is an arboreal but heavily built species with a brown or tawny coloration. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Description.
Adults grow to more than 30 inches (76 cm) in length and are heavily built. The maximum length is unknown.
Scalation includes 19 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 159 ventral scales, 42 subcaudal scales and 10 supralabial scales, the third being the largest.
The color pattern varies from brown with faint patterning to tawny with dull brown blotches and spots along with a ventrolateral stripe.
This species, especially the population in the south, which was formerly referred to as "T. venustus" and recently shown to be a separate species, has often been confused with the mangrove pit viper, "T. purpureomaculatus". However, the two are easily distinguished by the first three supralabial scales, which are much enlarged in "T. kanburiensis".
Geographic range.
Found in Thailand. The type locality given is "limestone hills near Kanburi, south-western Siam" (= Kanchanaburi, Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand). Listed as "S.W. China" in the catalogue entry at the British Museum of Natural History.
Known only from two other areas near the type locality, as well as from the type locality given in Vogel (1991) for "T. venustus", which is "Thung Song, Provinz Nakhon Si Thammarat, Süd-Thailand".
Habitat.
Forest and open woodland.
Behavior.
Arboreal and nocturnal, although they have been reported basking during daylight hours. Retreats to seek shelter in the foliage during the heat of the day.
Feeding.
The diet consists of mammals and birds. Juveniles probably also feed on frogs and lizards.
Reproduction.
Ovoviviparous, with females giving birth to live young.
Taxonomy.
A review of this taxon by Warrell "et al." (1992) found that the only difference between "T. kanburiensis" and "T. venustus" was in the number of midbody dorsal scale: 19 vs. 21 respectively. Based on this, they doubted that these were different species.
However, Vogel et al. 1991 has shown that they are indeed different species where "kaburiensis" is found in northern Thailand while "venustus" is found in the southern regions of Thailand and northern Malaysia.

Faculty of Arts, Chulalongkorn University

The Faculty of Arts, Chulalongkorn University was established in 1917. It is one of the first 4 faculties of the university. Its former name is "Faculty of Arts and Science". At the time of establishment, the first 2 missions of the faculty were to teach the students humanities and sciences and to produce secondary school teachers. In 1934, the faculty started to offer a bachelor degree of Arts. Nowadays, there are many programs in undergraduate, graduate and doctor of philosophy.
History.
On March 26, 1916, H.M. King Vajiravudh had the Civil Service College elevated to the status of a university and named it after his father, Chulalongkorn. In the subsequent year, H.R.H. the Prince Rangsit of Chainat, who was the first Director-General of the University Affairs Department in the Ministry of Education, established the Faculty of Arts and Science together with other faculties in the University, namely, Engineering, Medicine and Political Science.
During its initial stages, the Faculty of Arts and Science placed emphasis on the instruction of courses related to Pre-Medicine—Chemistry, Biology and Physics and students could also take classes in English, French and History. In 1928, it offered a three-year program to grant a secondary-school teaching certificate. During the first two years, students in the program had to take classes required for graduation from the Faculty of Arts; these included Thai, Pali, English, French, History, Dhammavipak and Mathematics. Later, German was added to the program. In their third year, they had to fulfill requirements in pedagogy. In 1930, a three-year program in Science was launched. Students were made to take courses in Science during their first two years and complete the requirements in pedagogy in the third year before they could be granted with a certificate.
By royal decree, the Faculty of Arts and Science was divided in 1933. The Faculty of Arts was then sub-divided into the Division of Arts and the Division of Teachers’ Training. In the same way, the Faculty of Science was sub- divided into the Division of Science and the Division of Teachers’ Training. However, within the same year, the two faculties were merged once again and its structure was separated into nine divisions, namely, the Documentation Division and Library, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Thai and the Oriental Languages, Modern Languages, Geography and History and Teachers’ Training.
The program was further developed to offer a Bachelor’s degree in 1934. The number in the first batch of graduates from the Faculty of Arts was 33. Subsequently, a Master’s degree program was established in 1942 and two students graduated with an M.A. in 1944.
In 1943, the Faculty of Arts and Science was divided but continued to be under the administration of the same dean. In 1948, the Faculty of Arts had its name changed to the Faculty of Arts and Education and, in addition to a Bachelor’s degree in Arts, it offered a Bachelor’s degree in Education. During this time it consisted of four divisions—Thai and the Oriental Languages, Foreign Languages, Geography and History and Education.
In 1950, the Faculty of Arts was entirely separated from the Faculty of Science and its administration was undertaken by its own staff. In 1955, the Division of Library Science was established in the Faculty of Arts. Two years later, the Division of Education was promoted to become the Faculty of Education. In 1961, the Faculty of Arts was restructured and separated into six divisions: Thai, Eastern Languages, English, Western Languages, Geography and History and Library Science. Two divisions –Philosophy and Dramatic Arts, were founded in 1971 and 1975 respectively. In 1975, Geography was separated from History. All divisions were later changed to the departmental status.
At present, the Faculty of Arts consists of eleven departments, namely, Thai, English, History, Geography, Library Science, Philosophy, Dramatic Arts, Eastern Languages, Western Languages, Linguistics and Comparative Literature.
Buildings.
Mahachulalongkorn Building.
Mahachulalongkorn Building () or "Tewalai" (), a building with traditional architectural style, was designed by a German architect from ministry of Interior named Dr.Karl Dohring and an English architect from ministry of Education named Mr. Edward Healey; The 2 architects mixed an ancient art from Sukothai and Sawankaloke with the western art. It was built in 1914 to be an office of the university.
On January 3, 1915, King Rama V went to the university for the opening of this building. And on March 26, 1916, the king renamed the university from the former name, "Kharatchakarnponlaruan" School (), to the new name, "Chulalongkorn" University (). The building was the first building and used to be an office of the university and named "Banchakarn" () before renamed to "Aksorasat" 1 () then "Mahachulalongkorn" respectively.
The Association of Siamese Architects under the Royal Patronage of His Majesty the King (ASA) considered this building as the best conserved building in 1987.
The Arts students also believe that the students who take a photo with a Phaya Naga at the stairs of the building won't graduate.
Aksorasat 2 building.
This building used to be an office and a library of the faculty
Borommaratchakumaree Building.
This building was named after Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. The area of this building used to be "Aksorasat" 3 building.

Bay Area Bisexual Network (BABN) is social and networking group in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is the oldest and largest bisexual group in the San Francisco Bay Area. Since 1987 BABN has welcomed people who are just coming out or new to the area to have opportunities to meet and talk with other bisexuals.
History.
Founded in 1987, BABN was the successor to the San Francisco Bisexual Center, which closed in 1984. It was inspired by the East Coast Bisexual Network Conference, and was founded by Lani Ka'ahumanu, Ann Justi and Maggi Rubenstein. For nearly 10 years, BABN coordinated a speaker's bureau, a newsletter, retreats, and monthly cultural and educational forums. BABN’s phone line offered one of very few ways for isolated bisexuals to find and connect with the bisexual community. Bi-Friendly was founded by BABN in 1988 as a way for bisexual and bi-friendly people to meet and socialize outside of bars and activist meetings. The group sponsored brunches, trips to the redwoods, movies, plays, baseball games etc. BABN is holding Bi-Friendly meetings as of 2012.
Services.
BABN provides support to the bisexual community, including a website and links to resources. BABN also has two email lists: One low-volume, moderated list for events of interest to the bisexual community, and a second, unmoderated list for open discussion.
For hundreds of bisexual people, the email lists are their only contact to the bi community. BABN also has social networking groups on Facebook, Tribe.net and others. A calendar of events is the most-used feature of the BABN website.

Mozambique–South Africa Oil Pipeline

The Mozambique–South Africa Oil Pipeline is a proposed multiproduct petrol and diesel fuel pipeline from Maputo to Gauteng, South Africa.
Route.
The long pipeline will run from an existing coastal fuel-storage facility at Matola harbour in Mozambique to Nelspruit, Mpumalanga in South Africa. From there the pipeline will then continue to Kendal in Mpumalanga, where it could join the current Transnet Pipelines petroleum pipeline network. The project also foresees potential transport to neighboring countries, such as Botswana.
Technical description.
The initial capacity of the pipeline will be 6 million cubic meters of oil per year. It is possible that the maximum capacity would be higher because of the high demand. The project foresees the refurbishment and construction of tankage and improved loading capabilities in Matola, and new tankage in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga.
The technical design of the pipeline is led by VGI Consulting Engineers. The environmental impact assessment is coordinated by Nature & Business Alliance Africa. The pipeline is expected to cost US$620 million. The construction will start in 2009 and the pipeline is expected to be operational by 2011.
Project company.
The project is to be implemented by Petroline, a joint venture between Mozambican and South African companies. The biggest shareholder is Petróleos de Moçambique (Petromoc) with the stake of 40%. Other shareholders are Gigajoule International (Pty) Ltd, Companhia de Desenvolvimento de Petroleo de Mocambique, and WOESA Consortium (Pty) Ltd.

All but "Def Stan 00-74" were withdrawn in July 2007, the MOD and representatives from the Working group considering that it was the only standard "bearing any influence".
Proposed Standards for Software (Def Stan 00-74).
"Def Stan 00-74" is defined in the context of Integrated Modular Avionics. Software components are located on modules.
Links to ARINC 653 and POSIX.
The field covered by ASAAC in "Def Stan 00-74" is similar to ARINC 653 (ARINC 653 is a software specification for space and time partitioning in avionics). However, there are differences between the two standards: Some features of ASAAC API, such as file handling, thread managing inside process, or debugging, are not considered in ARINC 653.
However, for the part where the two standards overlap, it is often possible to translate ASAAC interfaces in ARINC 653 API calls (and even in POSIX calls). Approximately 30% of the ASAAC API is covered directly by ARINC 653 and POSIX. 
For example, the following call defined in ASAAC:

Quo Tai-chi

Quo Tai-chi (Chinese: 郭泰祺, Wade–Giles: Kuo T'ai-ch'i) was a Chinese career diplomat during Republican Era of China and active member of the Kuomintang from the early years of the Republic of China until shortly after the fall of mainland China to the Communist Party of China.
Quo was born in Hupei (Hubei) province in 1888 and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1911, Phi Beta Kappa.
He was one of the technical delegates of China to the Paris Peace Conference, 1918–1919. At a time when the victors of the Great War were negotiating the spoils of war and punishment of the conquered, Quo controversially stated it would be better for the Germans to retain their concessions in Shantung (Shandong) than to allow the aggressive, militarist Japanese to take possession of them. The Chinese delegation's wishes were largely ignored by the European powers, and Quo's words proved prophetic as over the next three decades, Japan's appetite for conquest proved genocidal.
Quo published a book in English, entitled "China's Fight for Democracy," in 1920, at a time when the Kuomintang was actively struggling against several regional warlords to reunify China as a democratic republic.
Quo Tai-chi held a variety of posts, including commissioner of foreign affairs of the "Canton government" in 1927 and Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1929, he resigned the post of vice-minister of foreign affairs in protest of the placement of so many former imperial and warlord bureaucrats in the Kuomintang's Nanking (Nanjing) government, but was convinced to return. During one of his tenures as Vice-Minister, he was beaten by an angry, nationalist mob in Shanghai in May 1932 for his decision to sign an armistice with the Japanese, who were continuously pushing further into Chinese territory. He signed the armistice from the hospital, but resigned his post that year.
From 1932 to 1940, Quo served as the first Chinese representative to Britain elevated from minister/legate to ambassador. He worked tirelessly to make China's case against Japan's continued, aggressive expansion in northern China at a time when the British were far more concerned with fascist acts of war on the Continent. He also lobbied for an end to British arms sales to the Japanese, whose airplanes, armed with British guns, were killing countless civilians in China even before war was declared. While ambassador to Court of St. James, Quo also signed treaties of amity between China and the republics of Latvia and Estonia.
In April 1941, Quo was named to replace Wang Ch'ung-hui as foreign minister by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. During his time as foreign minister, he negotiated an end to the special, extraterritorial rights exercised by the United States and United Kingdom in China since the mid-19th century. It was also he who, on December 8, 1941, confirmed that the Republic of China was officially at war with not only Empire of Japan, but also Nazi Germany and Kingdom of Italy.
Quo represented China at the newly formed United Nations in San Francisco in 1946. He also presided over the first session of the U.N. Security Council held in March 1946 in New York. In November 1947, Y.P. Tsiang was named permanent Chief Chinese Delegate to the United Nations, replacing Quo. In December 1947, Quo was appointed Chinese ambassador to Brazil, replacing Cheng Tien-ku. He could remain the seat of China in the UN despite the communists' dominance in Mainland China and the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
Quo died on February 29, 1952 in Santa Barbara, California. He was 63.

Kadamattom Church

Kadamattom Church is one of the ancient churches in India. The church is situated near to Kolenchery town near Muvattupuzha, India.
History.
The church is believed to have established in the 9th Century AD. Kadamattom church (Saint George Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church). There is no concrete evidence of the exact date of the establishment of the church but as per historians the church was built before AD 650 as at the time Kolencherry church was yet to be constructed. (Kolencherry church was built around AD 650).
The church and the property was a gift by 'Karthas' the then prominent family of Kadamattom. One of the kid of the family caught by a disease which was neither identified nor cured by the local doctors. Mar Abo, the middle eastern monk from Egypt reached Kadamattom at the same time. He cured the disease and the Karthas were very happy and as a favor they provided the land and constructed the Church in its form as it is now.
Location.
Kadamattom church is situated in National Highway 49 (India) (Kochi-Madhurai National Highway) between Kolenchery and Muvattupuzha towns in Ernakulam District. While traveling from Cochin towards East, you could see this ancient church in the Northern side of the road after 2 kilometers from Kolenchery Medical College Junction. While traveling from Muvattupuzha towards Kolenchery, the church can be seen after 1 Kilometer after Peruvammuzhi junction.
Church.
Once you enter the church, at the left there’s a photo of Mar Abo Metropolitan. He is Rev. Paulose, alias the legendary Kadamattathu Kathanar’s mentor. It is believed that Mar Abo, a Persian high priest established the church with the help of Kartha, the then local ruler of Kadamattom. Mar Abo was not only a theologian but also a conjurer. He stayed in a hut with a poor widow and her only son Paulose. Paulose assisted Mar Abo for years and later Paulose was ordained a priest. A Persian cross can be seen on the right wall of the Madhbaha or Holy of Holies, having four equal arms with ancient writings inscribed. The wings of the cross also end with floral designs. The tombstone of Mar Thoma IX (Formerly Pakalomattom Iype Kathanar) lies on the left side just outside the Madhbaha. Another unique thing about the church is the door lock (wood mechanism). The pathala kinar (well) lies near the Poyyedom church. It is believed that Kathanar went to pathalam from here.
The Kathanar’s devotees, mostly non-Christians, throw in chicken, money and bottles of liquor into the well as mark of respect and gratitude. Kadamattom feast is one of the major festivals observed held during the January – February period. It marks the death anniversary of the legendary priest. There are many legends of Kadamattathu Kathanar. It is believed that he possessed supernatural powers.The old church is the one which you see when you walk up the numerous stairs in front of the church. It's a very silent environment, and when you start climbing the first entrance you can see the kadamattom ITC which is run by the church authorities.The Church consists of jacobites and a small faction of Indian orthodox Christians.
After that when we enter the church we can see the church which looks magnificent with its huge structure and the greenery around. There are 2 other churches associated with this. The one on the right side is the Parumala church which is built in remembrance of a holy priest named Parumala Thirumeni. When you look at the left side of the church you can see a gate with two lion statues on both sides as if they are guarding the church. When you go out of that gate you can see the steep way down to the church which was built separately for the legendary Kadamattom Kathanar since his way of action was totally different from the normal way which the church accepts. when you go to that church dot forget to have a look at the well which is believed as an entrance to the underworld, through he went to visit the jungle chief who taught all the magical powers to him.

Eva Marshal

Eva Marshal (1203 – 1246) was a Cambro-Norman noblewoman and the wife of the powerful Marcher lord William de Braose. She was the daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and the granddaughter of Strongbow and Aoife of Leinster.
She held de Braose lands and castles in her own right following the public hanging of her husband by the orders of Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Wales.
Family and marriage.
Lady Eva was born in 1203, in Pembroke Castle, Pembrokeshire, Wales, the fifth daughter and tenth child of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke. Her paternal grandparents were John Marshal and Sibyl of Salisbury, and her maternal grandparents were Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, known to history as Strongbow and Aoife of Leinster, for whom she was probably named. 
Lady Eva was the youngest of ten children, having had five older brothers and four older sisters. Eva and her sisters were described as being handsome, high-spirited girls. From 1207 to 1212, Eva and her family lived in Ireland.
Sometime before 1221, she married Marcher lord William de Braose, who in June 1228 succeeded to the lordship of Abergavenny, and by whom she had four daughters. William was the son of Reginald de Braose and his first wife Grecia Briwere. He was much hated by the Welsh who called him "Gwilym Ddu" or "Black William". 
Widowhood.
Eva's husband was publicly hanged by Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Wales on 2 May 1230 after being discovered in the Prince's bedchamber together with his wife Joan, Lady of Wales. Several months later, Eva's eldest daughter Isabella married the Prince's son, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, as their marriage contract had been signed prior to William de Braose's death. Prince Llywelyn wrote to Eva shortly after the execution, offering his apologies, explaining that he had been forced to order the hanging due to the insistence by the Welsh lords. He concluded his letter by adding that he hoped the execution would not affect their business dealings. 
Following her husband's execution, Eva held de Braose lands and castles in her own right. She is listed as holder of Totnes in 1230, which she held until her death. It is recorded on the Close Rolls (1234–1237) that Eva was granted 12 marks by King Henry III of England to strengthen Hay Castle. She had gained custody of Hay as part of her dower.
In early 1234, Eva was caught up in her brother Richard's rebellion against King Henry and possibly acted as one of the arbitrators between the King and her mutinous brothers following Richard's murder in Ireland. This is evidenced by the safe conduct she received in May 1234, thus enabling her to speak with the King. By the end of that month, she had a writ from King Henry granting her seisen of castles and lands he had confiscated from her following her brother's revolt. Eva also received a formal statement from the King declaring that she was back in "his good graces again".
She died in 1246 at the age of forty-three.
Royal descendants.
Most notably through her daughter Maud, who married Roger Mortimer, she was the ancestress of the English kings: Edward IV, Edward V, Richard III, and all monarchs from Henry VIII onwards. She was also the ancestress of Queen consorts Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr by three of her four daughters; Eleanor, Maud, and Eva de Braose.

<doc id="18594202" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18594202" title="Prevalence of mental disorders">
Prevalence of mental disorders

The prevalence of mental disorders has been studied around the world, providing estimates on how common mental disorders are. Different criteria or thresholds of severity have sometimes been used. 
National and international figures are typically estimated by large-scale surveys of self-reported symptoms up to the time of assessment; sometimes a figure is calculated for the occurrence of disorder in the week, month or year prior to assessment–a point or period prevalence; sometimes the figure is for a person's lifetime prior to assessment–the so-called lifetime prevalence.
Population studies.
Numerous large-scale surveys of the prevalence of mental disorders in adults in the general population have been carried out since the 1980s based on self-reported symptoms assessed by standardized structured interviews, usually carried out over the phone. 
Mental disorders have been found to be common, with over a third of people in most countries reporting sufficient criteria to be diagnosed at some point in their life. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported in 2001 that about 450 million people worldwide suffer from some form of mental disorder or brain condition, and that one in four people meet criteria at some point in their life.
World Health Organization global study.
The World Health Organization is currently undertaking a global survey of 26 countries in all regions of the world, based on ICD and DSM criteria. The first published figures on the 14 country surveys completed to date, indicate that, of those disorders assessed, anxiety disorders are the most common in all but 1 country (prevalence in the prior 12-month period of 2.4% to 18.2%) and mood disorders next most common in all but 2 countries (12-month prevalence of 0.8% to 9.6%), while substance disorders (0.1%–6.4%) and impulse-control disorders (0.0%–6.8%) were consistently less prevalent.
The United States, Colombia, the Netherlands and Ukraine tended to have higher prevalence estimates across most classes of disorder, while Nigeria, Shanghai and Italy were consistently low, and prevalence was lower in Asian countries in general. Cases of disorder were rated as mild (prevalence of 1.8%–9.7%), moderate (prevalence of 0.5%–9.4%) and serious (prevalence of 0.4%–7.7%).
The World Health Organization has published worldwide incidence and prevalence estimates of individual disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is two to three times as common in Latin America, Africa, and Europe as in Asia and Oceania. Schizophrenia appears to be most common in Japan, Oceania, and Southeastern Europe and least common in Africa. Bipolar disorder and panic disorder have very similar rates around the world.
However, these are widely believed to be underestimates, due to poor diagnosis (especially in countries without affordable access to mental health services) and low reporting rates, in part because of the predominant use of self-report data, rather than semi-structured instruments such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID); actual lifetime prevalence rates for mental disorders are estimated to be between 65% and 85%.
US mental health studies.
Previous widely cited large-scale surveys in the US were the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) survey and subsequent National Comorbidity Survey (NCS). The NCS was replicated and updated between 2000 and 2003 and indicated that, of those groups of disorders assessed, nearly half of Americans (46.4%) reported meeting criteria at some point in their life for either a DSM-IV anxiety disorder (28.8%), mood disorder (20.8%), impulse-control disorder (24.8%) or substance use disorders (14.6%). Half of all lifetime cases had started by age 14 and 3/4 by age 24. 
In the prior 12-month period only, around a quarter (26.2%) met criteria for any disorder—anxiety disorders 18.1%; mood disorders 9.5%; impulse control disorders 8.9%; and substance use disorders 3.8%. A substantial minority (23%) met criteria for more than two disorders. 22.3% of cases were classed as serious, 37.3% as moderate and 40.4% as mild.
European population studies.
A 2004 cross-European study found that approximately one in four people reported meeting criteria at some point in their life for one of the DSM-IV disorders assessed, which included mood disorders (13.9%), anxiety disorders (13.6%) or alcohol disorder (5.2%). Approximately one in ten met criteria within a 12-month period. Women and younger people of either gender showed more cases of disorder.
A 2005 review of 27 studies have found that 27% of adult Europeans is or has been affected by at least one mental disorder in the past 12 months. It was also found that the most frequent disorders were anxiety disorders, depressive, somatoform and substance dependence disorders.
Specific mental disorders.
Anxiety disorders.
A review that pooled surveys in different countries up to 2004 found overall average prevalence estimates for any anxiety disorder of 10.6% (in the 12 months prior to assessment) and 16.6% (in lifetime prior to assessment), but that rates for individual disorders varied widely. Women had generally higher prevalence rates than men, but the magnitude of the difference varied.
Mood disorders.
A review that pooled surveys of mood disorders in different countries up to 2000 found 12-month prevalence rates of 4.1% for major depressive disorder (MDD), 2% for dysthymic disorder and 0.72% for bipolar 1 disorder. The average lifetime prevalence found was 6.7% for MDD (with a relatively low lifetime prevalence rate in higher-quality studies, compared to the rates typically highlighted of 5%–12% for men and 10%–25% for women), and rates of 3.6% for dysthymia and 0.8% for Bipolar 1.
Schizophrenia.
A 2005 review of prior surveys in 46 countries on the prevalence of schizophrenic disorders, including a prior 10-country WHO survey, found an average (median) figure of 0.4% for lifetime prevalence up to the point of assessment and 0.3% in the 12-month period prior to assessment. A related figure not given in other studies (known as lifetime morbid risk), reported to be an accurate statement of how many people would theoretically develop schizophrenia at any point in life regardless of time of assessment, was found to be "about seven to eight individuals per 1,000" (0.7/0.8%). The prevalence of schizophrenia was consistently lower in poorer countries than in richer countries (though not the incidence), but the prevalence did not differ between urban/rural areas or men/women (although incidence did).
Personality disorders.
Studies of the prevalence of personality disorders (PDs) have been fewer and smaller-scale, but a broader Norwegian survey found a similar overall prevalence of almost 1 in 7 (13.4%), based on meeting personality criteria over the prior five-year period. Rates for specific disorders ranged from 0.8% to 2.8%, with rates differing across countries, and by gender, educational level and other factors. A US survey that incidentally screened for personality disorder found an overall rate of 14.79%.
Child psychiatric disorders.
Approximately 7% of a preschool pediatric sample were given a psychiatric diagnosis in one clinical study, and approximately 10% of 1- and 2-year-olds receiving developmental screening have been assessed as having significant emotional/behavioral problems based on parent and pediatrician reports.

Billy Bancroft

William John "Billy" Bancroft (2 March 1871 – 3 March 1959) was a Welsh international fullback who played club rugby for Swansea and a county cricketer for Glamorgan, becoming their first professional player in 1895.
Bancroft was seen as one of the first true stars of Welsh rugby and played rugby with extreme self-confidence. He possessed great speed and was an excellent kicker of the ball, though some critics felt his defensive play was weak. His brother Jack also played rugby for Wales.
Club career in rugby.
Bancroft made his first club appearance for Swansea on 5 October 1889. He would play for Swansea for his entire career and is considered one of the greatest fullbacks to have played for the club. In the fourteen seasons he played with Swansea he was their top points scorer in twelve of them.
International rugby career.
Bancroft was first capped on 1 February 1890 against Scotland as a replacement for the injured Tommy England. Bancroft would play 33 times for his country, all consecutively, a record that would lay unbroken until Ken Jones did so in 1954. Although Bancroft would only win two out of his first nine Welsh games, he was part of the Wales team that won their first Triple Crown in 1893. The first game of that season saw Wales face England at the Cardiff Arms Park. With little time left to play and Wales losing 9–11, they were awarded a penalty near touch, 30 yards from the England goal line. The Welsh captain, Arthur Gould called Bancroft over and told him to kick (from the ground) for goal. Bancroft insisted on dropping for goal, but Gould forbade it. The two began arguing in front of the home crowd, until in frustration Gould threw the ball to the ground and walked away. Bancroft successfully kicked the drop goal which would win the match for Wales. This penalty goal although dropped by Bancroft was still awarded as such, and was rugby's first ever penalty goal.
In 1899 in a match against Ireland at Stradey Park, Bancroft would fail to complete an international match for the only time in his career. Due to no barriers around the pitch the crowd were lined up around the touch line. The referee was forced to delay the match for half an hour while police and officials attempted to force the crowd back. During the second half Bancroft attempted another one of his testing runs to tire out the opposition but was caught by, Mick and Jack, Ireland's Ryan brothers, who tackled Bancroft and dumped him over the touchline and into the crowd. Bancroft landed awkwardly and fractured several ribs, forcing him to retire from the game.
After the "Gould Affair", Bancroft was given the captaincy in 1898, and led Wales to their second Triple Crown in 1900.

Cricket career.
Bancroft first played cricket for Glamorgan at the age of 18 in a friendly match against Warwickshire at the Cardiff Arms Park in 1889. He quickly became a regular player and when Glamorgan decided to appoint their first professional cricketer, around the mid 1890's, they selected Bancroft. A fine all-round player at minor county level, Bancroft would not only bat and bowl, but would sometimes stand in as wicket keeper. He represented Glamorgan against South Africa in their 1894 tour of Great Britain His batting record at Glamorgan ended with a total of 8,250 runs with his best innings of 207 scored in 1903 against Berkshire.
Bancroft kept his ties with Glamorgan after retiring as a player, and coached many youngsters who came through the club, including future Test cricketer Gilbert Parkhouse.
St. Helen's ground.
Bancroft had very close ties to St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground, having lived there as a child where his father, and his father before him, were groundsman. He played club rugby at the ground with Swansea and cricket there with Glamorgan. In his later years he too would become St Helen's groundsman.

National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)

The "National Lampoon's Vacation" film series is a comedy film series initially based on John Hughes' short story "Vacation '58" that was originally published by "National Lampoon" magazine. The series is distributed by Warner Bros. and consists of four theatrical films and one made-for-television spin-off film. In recent years, the series has been the inspiration for various advertising campaigns featuring some of the original cast members. The series portrays the misadventures of the Griswold family, whose attempts to enjoy vacations and holidays are plagued with continual disasters and strangely ridiculous predicaments.
History.
Development.
After the success of "National Lampoon's Animal House" in 1978, it was decided that another story from the "National Lampoon" magazine should be adapted into a film. One of such stories chosen for development was John Hughes' "Vacation '58" that was originally published in the September 1979 issue of "National Lampoon". Hughes wrote the screenplay for the first "Vacation" film as "a fairly straight adaptation of the short story," with the exception of the ending that was rewritten and reshot after being "thoroughly despised by preview audiences." In addition to Hughes, "Vacation" involved the crew of many people connected to "National Lampoon". The film was produced by Lampoon co-founder and "Animal House" producer, Matty Simmons, and directed by Lampoon alumnus and "Animal House" co-writer Harold Ramis.
Released on July 29, 1983, "National Lampoon's Vacation" proved to be a financial and critical success. Simmons went on to produce two sequels, with scripts by Hughes. While involved with the early stages of a third sequel, "Vegas Vacation", Simmons resigned from production due to creative differences. As a result, the film was made without the "National Lampoon" title.
During an interview on the TBS series "Dinner and a Movie", Beverly D'Angelo revealed that due to the success of "Animal House", the original "Vacation" was envisioned as a raunchier R-rated comedy targeting young adults. This was principally the reason for nudity such as D'Angelo's shower scene, and Chase's profanity-laced tirades and pool scene with Christie Brinkley. However, the movie's success with larger family audiences who identified with Chase's everyman-father character caught the filmmakers by surprise. As a result, subsequent sequels were toned down and family friendly, with PG-13 or PG ratings.
Casting.
Just like John Belushi, who starred in "Animal House", Chevy Chase had previously performed in the National Lampoon Radio Hour and in the stage show "National Lampoon Lemmings", both of which were spin-offs from "National Lampoon" magazine.
In each of the main films of the series, the Griswold children are portrayed by different actors. This is usually attributed to the fact that after Anthony Michael Hall declined to reprise his role in "European Vacation" in order to star in "Weird Science", it was decided to recast both children. Chase has indicated that it was his idea to continue recasting the children by explaining, "I always wanted to make the joke, 'Geez, I hardly ever get the chance to see the kids anymore. I hardly know who they are. We should go on a vacation.' That was funny to me: the idea that Clark was such a great family man, but still didn't even recognize his own children."
Unproduced scripts.
Shortly after making "European Vacation", Chase and Eric Idle began to write a script for a follow up called "National Lampoon's Australian Vacation". According to Idle, "We spent some time working together on it. It had some nice shark gags, but I can't pretend it was in any way finished." The concept of "Australian Vacation" resurfaced in the 90s as a potential fifth installment of the series, but nothing ever came of it.
Prior to the confirmed plans of New Line Cinema rebooting the series, Chase made note that he has developed another sequel tentatively entitled "Swiss Family Griswold". In 2011, Chase revealed that he and Beverly D'Angelo have been working on the idea. He explained, "There’s a cruise, there’s a fire on the ship, we think the whole ship’s on fire and we jump—it’s just a little fire—and we end up on an island where we meet Randy somewhere who’s been left there from an old "Survivor" series."
Reboot.
In 2010, it was announced by New Line Cinema (owned by Warner Bros., which released the previous films) that a new "Vacation" film was being produced. Originally set to be produced by David Dobkin and written by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, the story was to focus on Rusty Griswold as he took his own family to Walley World before the theme park permanently closes.
In July 2012, it was announced that Ed Helms will star in "Theme Park Vacation" as Rusty Griswold. The film is to follow Rusty, who now has his own family misadventures on the road. John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein will write and direct the film, which is scheduled to begin filming in June 2013 throughout Atlanta and New Mexico. On March 28, 2013, Variety announced that original series stars Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase were in talks to reprise their roles, most likely in the form of a torch-passing cameo role. No mention was made of other series regulars such as Randy Quaid's Cousin Eddie. On April 23, 2013, it was reported that the film has been delayed indefinitely due to creative differences.
Films.
"National Lampoon's Vacation" (1983).
"Vacation" was directed by Harold Ramis and written by John Hughes. The film follows Clark and Ellen Griswold as they take their two children, Rusty and Audrey, on a cross-country trip from their home in Chicago, Illinois to the California theme-park Walley World. Planned out by Clark, the trip begins to go awry after getting lost in St. Louis, Missouri. From there, the family makes it to Coolidge, Kansas, where they spend the night at the home of Ellen's cousin Catherine and husband Eddie. There they are forced to take their Aunt Edna and her dog to Phoenix, Arizona. Along the way to Phoenix, Clark accidentally drags Edna's dog from the back of the car and Edna dies during a long day of driving. Dropping Edna's body off at cousin Normy's place in Phoenix, the family soon makes it to Walley World only to find that the park is closed.
"National Lampoon's European Vacation" (1985).
"European Vacation" was directed by Amy Heckerling and written by John Hughes and Robert Klane. After becoming the winning family on a game show called "Pig In A Poke," the Griswolds win a two-week trip to Europe. The vacation begins in London, where the family visits sights such as Big Ben, Parliament, and Buckingham Palace. Having trouble with driving on the left side of the road, Clark ends up in many accidents and unknowingly knocks down Stonehenge. From there they stop in France, where their camcorder gets stolen; in West Germany, where they spend the night in the home of strangers they mistake for their relatives; and in Italy, where they become involved with robbery and kidnapping.
This was the only "Vacation" film that did not feature Randy Quaid's "Cousin Eddie" character. In the opening "Pig in a Poke" sequence as well as the film's end credits, the family's name is spelled as "Griswald" as opposed to "Griswold".
"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" (1989).
"Christmas Vacation" was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and written by John Hughes. The film follows Clark Griswold's attempt at delivering "the most fun-filled old-fashioned family Christmas ever." As the Griswold family's dysfunctional relatives begin arriving early, Clark becomes obsessed with ensuring that everything goes right. Meanwhile, Clark is also expecting a large Christmas bonus check that will cover a surprise backyard swimming pool that he already ordered. However, when the Christmas bonuses are cut, Clark instead receives a one-year membership Jelly of the Month Club that causes him to snap and go crazy.
This was the first film in the series to have made Audrey older than Rusty, now played by Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki respectively. It was also the only film in the "Vacation" series not to feature the song "Holiday Road" by Lindsey Buckingham.
"Vegas Vacation" (1997).
"Vegas Vacation" was directed by Stephen Kessler and written by Elisa Bell, based on a story by Bell and Bob Ducsay. After receiving a large bonus check, Clark takes his family on vacation to Las Vegas, Nevada. Immediately hitting the blackjack tables, Clark begins to blow all of his money resulting in the family breaking off in their own directions. While Clark tries to regain his money through the help of his cousin-in-law Eddie, Ellen becomes infatuated with Wayne Newton as Rusty wins big at the dice tables and Audrey turns to go-go dancing with her cousin Vicki.
Other.
"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2" (2003).
"Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure" is a made-for-TV spin-off film directed by Nick Marck and written by Matty Simmons. After a workplace accident involving a monkey, Eddie Johnson is given a free vacation for him and his family to an island in the South Pacific. But when Eddie attempts to catch a shark during a family boat trip, they become lost and eventually shipwrecked on an isolated island.
It can be considered a sequel to "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation", although it is more of a spin-off than a direct chapter in the "Vacation" series, because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo do not appear. It stars Randy Quaid and Miriam Flynn, reprising their roles as Cousin Eddie and Catherine, with Dana Barron returning as Audrey Griswold.
"Hotel Hell Vacation" (2010).
"Hotel Hell Vacation" is a short film directed by Bryan Buckley. On their way to visit their son Rusty and his family at a vacation rental, Clark and Ellen Griswold decide to have a romantic getaway at a hotel before they get there. Everything, however, goes wrong at the hotel for the couple and they hastily make their way to Rusty's rental.
The film was a campaign ad for HomeAway that originally aired in part during the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV and in entirety on Homeaway.com. While it was sanctioned by Warner Bros., it was not sponsored by the National Lampoon label.
"Old Navy ad campaign" (2012).
In November and December 2012, series regulars Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo were featured in a set of commercials for Old Navy. Joining them in one commercial were Juliette Lewis (from "Christmas Vacation"), Dana Barron and Anthony Michael Hall (from "Vacation"), and Jason Lively (from "European Vacation"); that spot featured three Rustys and three Audreys (including a "new Rusty" and a "new Audrey," both of whom were children).
Continuity and recurring elements.
The Griswold children.
Aside from the obvious issues with the characters' physical appearances due to being played by different actors, Rusty and Audrey both age on a floating timeline. It is assumed that each film takes place in the year they are actually filmed, as no other indication of time is mentioned and the characters' clothing, cars, and environment are contemporary to the time of each films' releases. In most of the films it is never mentioned which of the two children is older. Rusty and Audrey appear to be in their early teens in "Vacation" (1983), and in their mid-teens in "European Vacation" (1985) two years later (at one point in the film, Rusty specifically mentions that he is fifteen years old). However, in "Christmas Vacation" (1989), while Audrey appears to be in her late teens, Rusty looks younger than he did in the preceding films. Whereas in "Vegas Vacation" (1997), both children are in their late teens to which Clark tells the kids, "I hardly recognize you anymore!" The next shot freezes for a moment on the kids sitting silently, making fun of the discontinuity.
Dana Barron, who was then in her late thirties, reprised the role of Audrey in "Christmas Vacation 2" (2003). Rusty is also portrayed as an adult with a wife and daughter in "Hotel Hell Vacation" (2010).
Eddie and Catherine Johnson.
Eddie and Catherine have the following named children which are shown: Vicky Johnson, Daisy Mable Johnson, Dale Johnson (Vacation) Rocky Johnson, Ruby Sue Johnson (Christmas Vacation) Denny Johnson (Vegas Vacation) and Clark "Third" Johnson (Christmas Vacation 2); in addition there appear to be several others mentioned in passing.
Walley World.
Walley World is mentioned in each of the subsequent films following "Vacation".
Clark's tirades.
Clark Griswold is usually very laid back and mild mannered, even in the face of adversity and his family's seeming lack of appreciation for his efforts on their behalf. However, when Clark is pushed beyond the limit of his patience, he tends to lose his temper and go on insane tirades, as seen in the first "Vacation", where he lashes out at his family for not wanting to continue the trip. Clark also flips in "Christmas Vacation" where he gets angry at his relatives because of their wanting to leave, and went into a tirade against his boss.
The girl in the red Ferrari.
In the first Vacation film Clark sees a sexy woman driving a red Ferrari. He then encounters her at a hotel and his attempts to seduce her result in embarrassing failure. In Vegas Vacation, years later, Clark once again drives alongside the same woman, reprised by Christie Brinkley, asking "remember me?" After she responds that she does, Clark spots a baby in the backseat of her convertible.
Reception.
Box office.
When released in 1983, "National Lampoon's Vacation" was a significant box-office hit. The film earned over $61 million in the United States with an estimated budget of $15 million.
Without being adjusted for inflation, the profit earned by the individual "Vacation" films follow behind "National Lampoon's Animal House" as the highest grossing films of the National Lampoon brand. 
Legacy.
In 2000, readers of "Total Film" magazine voted "National Lampoon's Vacation" as the 46th greatest comedy film of all time. The film was also nominated for AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list in 2000. It is widely considered to be the best film in "National Lampoon's" series of "Vacation" films, and continues to be a popular film and a staple on cable television channels. "Christmas Vacation" has additionally become a television staple, especially during the holiday season, as it is often been labeled as a contemporary Christmas classic.
Appearance in Popular Culture.
In the Family Guy episode Blue Harvest, the Griswold Family is seen driving past the Death Star during the battle at the end.

Big Wave Dave's

"Big Wave Dave's" is a sitcom that ran from August 9, 1993 until September 13, 1993. In it, three friends decide to drop everything and run a surf shop in Hawaii. When they arrive, they find out that it's not as easy as they thought. The show was produced by Levine & Isaacs Productions in association with Paramount Television.
Pilot synopsis.
The pilot episode opens with three friends, Marshall Fisher (Adam Arkin), Richie Lamonica (Patrick Breen), and Dave Bell (David Morse), sitting in a bar, talking. Apparently, Marshall has just lost his job, and Dave is divorcing his wife. Dave comes up with the idea of starting a surf shop in Hawaii called "Big Wave Dave's", and the whole club starts dreaming about it. Dave suggests that they should really do it; his friends are a bit doubtful, but they eventually decide to go along with it. But then they think about Marshall's wife, and they have to convince her. That same night, the three guys go over to Marshall's house to convince his wife, Karen (Jane Kaczmarek). Out of the blue, Karen decides to go along with them. 
All of them, very excited, arrive in Hawaii a few weeks later. Karen tries to help Dave and Marshall with decorating the store, but they want to do that on their own. After looking around the store a bit, Dave decides to go surfing. A few seconds later, Richie comes into the store saying that he found himself in Hawaii. Meanwhile, a man with a barrow carrying Dave comes in, saying that he blames the Beach Boys for all the surfers at the beach. Dave had had a surfing accident but seems to be all right. The man introduces himself as Jack Lord and says that he hates newcomers on the beach and that he had named himself after his idol, Jack Lord. When he leaves the shop, it starts raining. Two hours later, when it's still raining, Marshall decides to leave, but nobody wants to go with him. Dave doesn't want to go because this was his idea, and Richie still believes he's a different person in Hawaii. When a woman walks in, Richie wants to prove that he's different here; after saying hello to her, however, he decides to go back to Chicago. Just when the guys are about to leave, Karen walks in and gives them a speech that pulls them back in. When Marshall still isn't happy, Karen reveals that she became pregnant the night they decided to go to Hawaii.

Cangarda

The Cangarda is a long luxury steam yacht built in 1901, at the Pusey and Jones Shipyard in Wilmington, Delaware.
In the late 19th and early 20th century, huge fortunes were made prior to US income taxation. Opulence in homes and yachting reached a peak; many small private steamships like "Cangarda" were produced in the US, Britain and Germany for the very wealthy. However, "Cangarda" is the last surviving US-built steam yacht in the US, and one of only three left in the world.
After years of service in roles from opulence to indignity, the yacht sank in the Boston Harbor in 1999 in poor repair, but has since been completely restored at Richmond, California for use as a private yacht and periodic museum ship. She will be a part-time feature of the maritime museum at Mystic, Connecticut.
History.
"Cangarda" was named as a combination of the last names of the original owners, Michigan lumber mogul Charles Canfield and his wife Belle Gardner. In 1904, George Taylor Fulford, a wealthy member of the Canadian Parliament, bought the boat and renamed her "Magedoma", which was a combination of syllables from the names of his wife and children (MAry, GEorge, DOrothy, MArtha.) The boat was docked at Fulford Place, his mansion nestled on the banks of the St. Lawrence River in Brockville, Ontario, Canada.
After Fulford's death in 1905, the yacht remained in the family and in 1927 his wife hosted the Prince of Wales, The Prince George (future Duke of Kent), and the Prime Ministers of both England and Canada, Stanley Baldwin and William Lyon Mackenzie King respectively, on board.
During World War II, "Cangarda" (or "Magedoma", as it was then known) was donated by the family to the Royal Canadian Navy, to be used as a training vessel. After the war the ship was returned to the Fulford family, but in poor condition. The ship was sold to Frederic Burtis Smith who lived aboard for many years at Rochester, NY, His efforts to preserve the old yacht and carry her into a time when interest in old things was growing can be credited with saving the vessel. But she slowly went into disrepair. In the early 1980s an attempt was made to restore her. The ship was disassembled in Boston and an effort was made to rebuild the hull, but the project failed and in 1999 the gutted hull sank in Boston Harbor. Fortunately, these efforts preserved the interior and restored the machinery for later use.
Present day.
In 2004, after years of efforts by historians and yachtsman, Jeff Rutherford of Richmond, California began a full restoration, funded by Marin, California resident Bob McNeil. The "Cangarda"’s original hull was damaged beyond repair, so it was meticulously measured including laser scanning. A new hull was reverse-engineered, using modern welding techniques, with the help of Geoff Molnar, rather than the original rivet style of fastening. The original machinery was reconditioned and reinstalled; however, the existing 1911 Almy (coal fired) boiler was replaced with an automated, forced draft, oil fired one. In addition, much of the elegant Victorian interior was reinstalled, using the original Cuban mahogany woodwork. The restoration was completed in 2009.
The "Cangarda" made a historic trip back to Brockville, Ontario – its long-time home – to the delight of local inhabitants from June 4–5, 2011. Tours of the yacht were available during this time to members of the public with all proceeds going to "The Friends of Fulford Place" – a volunteer group that raises funds for the restoration of Fulford Place National Historic Site.
The "Cangarda" will return to Brockville June 14–16, 2013 to take part in the Tall Ships 1812 Tour First Port of Call. The TALL SHIPS™ 1812 Tour is a Pan Provincial event that will travel throughout Ontario during the summer of 2013, commemorating the bicentennial for the War of 1812. 16 ports will participate in this event which is produced in partnership with the TALL SHIPS CHALLENGE™ Great Lakes 2013 series.

Orange Lake (New York)

Orange Lake is located near the hamlet named after it in the Town of Newburgh, New York, United States. At in surface area it is the largest lake entirely within Orange County, after which it is named.
Geography.
The lake, long by wide, sits in a glacial trough, with extensive swamps abutting its north and south ends and gentle rises on the east and west. NY 52 follows the lake's southern shore through these swamps, and NY 300 passes the northern end of the swamps in that direction. Lakeside Road runs along the heavily-developed eastern side of the lake, while Rock Cut Road parallels the western shore and gives access to the less-developed neighborhoods there.
It is fed from the north by Bushfield Creek, which rises to the north in the Town of Shawangunk in Ulster County. The creek then drains to the east, closely following Route 52, until it empties into Quassaick Creek near Algonquin Park. Via the Quassaick, the lake's waters eventually reach the Hudson River at the boundary between the city of Newburgh and New Windsor.
On clear enough days, it is possible to see the Devil's Path range in the Greene County section of the Catskills from the lake's southern end. This is one of the farthest locations to the south from which these peaks can be seen without climbing a mountain.
History.
The Native Americans called the lake "Oussuk", meaning "stony pond." The Dutch settlers called it "Binnin", meaning "water within land" or "water between other waters". In 1684, Governor Thomas Dongan purchased the lake and surrounding territory from the Native Americans and divided this patent into numerous farms, most especially dairy farms. At the time of the Revolutionary War, a man named Capt. Thomas Machin owned and operated a saw mill, grist mill, and finally a mint in what is now the hamlet, at the very beginning of the outlet stream. An historical marker marks the site of Machin's Mill on Lakeside Road. At that time, the lake began to be called Machin's Pond. In the 1830s, a local clergyman named James B. Wilson began calling the lake Orange Lake. The reasons for this name change remain obscure, but are probably related to its location in Orange County. Local legend states that many residents objected to this name change, but it did stick and remains the name of the lake and the hamlet to this day.
Because the lake is above sea level, its outlet stream became a very popular site for mills. The largest was the Newburgh Bleachery, owned and operated by the Chadwick Family.
During the 19th century, the shores of the lake became a popular location for summer cottages. Transportation to the lake and the hamlet was difficult until 1895, when trolley service was established between the City of Newburgh and the Village of Walden, and Orange Lake, approximately the half way point, became a popular stop. Soon after this Newburgh and Walden Electric Railway initiated service, a highly successful amusement park opened on the south shore of the lake. The trolley line went out of business in 1926. The amusement park went out of business during the Great Depression and was demolished in 1941.
Pine Point was a highly successful resort on a peninsula off the southern shore of the lake. During the big band era, many nationally known recording acts appeared at the resort, including Frank Sinatra and Benny Goodman. It opened for business in 1896, and was closed and demolished in 1953. Lakeview House on Lakeside Road originally opened in 1866 as a boarding house, and did business as O'Malley's Bar for many years. Today, it continues to do business as a restaurant under its original name.
Use.
The lake is not part of any local water supply system, and there is no public access for recreational purposes. Residents of the Orange Lake community who live on the eastern shore, or in the "Orange Lake Estates" neighborhood off of Rock Cut Rd. on the western shore have deeded access to the lake whether their property is on it or not; they use it for boating, fishing and swimming in summer and ice fishing during colder periods in winter when it freezes over.

Frederick Alfred Rhead

Frederick Alfred Rhead (1856–1933) was a potter working in North Staffordshire, England. He is not to be confused with his son Frederick Hurten Rhead (1880–1942) who was also a potter, and who worked mainly in the USA. His other children included the pottery designer Charlotte Rhead.
Rhead's father, G.W. Rhead, worked in the pottery industry, and young Frederick was apprenticed at Mintons Ltd. He was one of a number of apprentices who in the 1870s learnt the art of "pâte-sur-pâte" decoration from Marc-Louis Solon, a French émigré who was the leading exponent of this ceramic technique. Rhead continued to work in "pâte-sur-pâte" after leaving Minton. He joined Wedgwood and went on to work at a number of potteries including a failed venture of his own. His most famous piece of ceramics is the "Gladstone Vase" which was presented to William Ewart Gladstone by the Liberals of Burslem in 1888. The vase is on public view, having been loaned to the Gladstone Pottery Museum in Longton, Staffordshire.
Besides working in three dimensions as a ceramic designer, Rhead worked in two dimensions as a graphic designer, although in the latter field he was somewhat overshadowed by his brother Louis Rhead who pursued a successful career in the USA. The three brothers Frederick, Louis and George Woolliscroft Rhead Jr collaborated on book illustration projects, for example an edition of "The Pilgrim's Progress".
Bibliography.
Bernard Bumpus (1921–2004) was the leading authority on the Rhead family. In 1986 Bumpus curated an exhibition at the Geffrye Museum in London. This exhibition, "Rhead Artists and Potters", toured several UK museums including the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent. Bumpus hoped to take a version of the exhibition to the USA, but, despite American interest in the Rhead family, this project foundered.

Regional Reference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe

Regional Reference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe (EUREF) is the sub-commission of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), part of the Sub-Commission 1.3 ("Regional Reference Frames"), under IAG Commission 1 ("Reference Frames").
EUREF deals with the definition, realization and maintenance of the European Geodetic Reference Frame. The goal of EUREF is to establish a unified geodetic datum (ETRS89) and a consistent network of reference stations (EPN) throughout Europe. EUREF was founded in 1987 at the IUGG General Assembly held in Vancouver.
Mission.
EUREF is driven by a voluntary agreement of scientific organisations and national geodetic/geographic agencies of the member countries, who are willing to replace their legacy national geodetic datums with a unified European Reference Frame and join their national networks of reference stations into a common European network. The mandate of EUREF is to foster and coordinate the activities of the member countries, which are financed and managed on the national level. EUREF realizes and maintains ETRS89, the European geodetic datum, which is to become a single datum used for geodetic applications in all the member countries. A key instrument in maintaining ETRS89 is the EUREF Permanent Network (EPN), a network of reference stations which covers the European continent. EUREF is also working on the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS), which goal is to determine a unified dm-level accurate geoid model and gravity-referenced height system throughout Europe. EUREF coordinates its activities with EuroGeographics.
Structure.
The activities of EUREF are discussed and decisions are taken at the annual symposium. The last symposia have been attended by more than 120 participants coming from about 30 member countries of Europe. The results of EUREF are available in the symposia proceedings, which contain the presented scientific papers as well as national reports, resolutions and documentation. Current activities are governed by the "Technical Working Group (TWG)", which is elected at the symposia and is meeting two/three times a year to manage current activities. The minutes of the TWG meetings are published annually together with the symposia proceedings.
European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89).
ETRS89 is a Cartesian ECEF geodetic datum, in which Eurasian Plate as a whole is static. Within Europe, coordinates and maps based on ETRS89 are stable because temporal variations due to the continental drift are minimized. ETRS89 coincided with the global ITRS datum in 1989, hence the name. ETRS89 and ITRS diverge due to the continental drift at a speed about 2.5 cm per year.
European Vertical Reference System (EVRS).
EVRS is a zero-tidal gravity-related height reference system. The EVRS is realized by the geopotential numbers and normal heights of nodal points of the United European Levelling Network 95/98 (UELN 95/98) extended for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania in relation to the Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). The geopotential numbers and normal heights of the nodal points are available for the participating countries under the name UELN 95/98 which is now given the name EVRF2000.
Projects.
There are several projects under development at EUREF.

On 18 November 2005, he joined Conference side Aldershot Town on a one month loan. He played three games for Terry Brown's "Shots" in an uneventful stay at the Recreation Ground. Back with Cheltenham, he scored two goals late into the 2005–06 season to put himself back into first team contention. He played 77 minutes of the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium, before he was taken off for Damian Spencer; Cheltenham held on to their 1–0 lead over Grimsby Town to win promotion into League One. Days before the game he signed a new two year contract with the club.
Vincent picked up a serious knee injury during a reserve team match in August 2006. After missing the rest of the 2006–07 season due to the injury, he marked his return to full fitness on 15 August 2007 with a "stunning" equalizing goal against Swindon Town. He played a total of 40 games in 2007–08, finding the net twice. In July 2008, he signed a new contract with the club; manager Keith Downing stated that "The boy's had a cruciate injury and he's a young one as well. He's still growing, getting bigger, better and stronger." Vincent had explained to Downing that he wanted to play as a striker, rather than his previous position on the right side of midfield. On 26 August 2008, Vincent scored against Premier League side Stoke City in a League Cup encounter. Two months later he was sidelined for six weeks after fracturing his wrist in two places. In February 2009, he rejected manager Martin Allen's offer of a new contract and was linked with a loan move to Bradford City. However he suffered a medial knee ligament injury the following month, which prevented the deal from going ahead. Despite this setback he remained insistent on a move away from Whaddon Road.
Colchester United.
In March 2009, Vincent joined Colchester United on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season. Manager Paul Lambert said that "He's got the enthusiasm and hunger and he'll be a big player for us next season. He's got pace, and when you've got that you've always got a chance." In May 2009, Lambert signed Vincent to a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. However Lambert left the club after the first game of the season – a 7–1 win over Norwich City – and was replaced by new boss Aidy Boothroyd. Vincent featured just 21 times in 2009–10, scoring three goals. He went on to feature 42 times in 2010–11, scoring a total of five goals.
Vincent missed six weeks at the start of the 2011–12 season with a knee ligament injury. In an interview given after his recovery, he admitted that he had feared the injury could have ended his career, and also hinted at a move to a Midlands club in the summer so as to be closer to his family. In December, he was struck down by a hamstring injury, which kept him out of action for several weeks. His injuries limited him to just 12 appearances in the campaign, as well as an appearance in the final of the Essex Senior Cup (which ended in a shock defeat to Canvey Island). At the end of the season, manager John Ward confirmed that he had played his last game for the club.
Port Vale.
In July 2012, Vincent signed a one-year deal with League Two side Port Vale. He started the 2012–13 season on the wing, opposite Jennison Myrie-Williams, and scored twice in the opening six league games to fire the "Valiants" into second place. After claiming goals against Oxford United and Wycombe Wanderers, he was named as League Two Player of the Month in October 2012, but credited his teammates, saying "this award is as much for them as it is for me".
He went 12 weeks without a goal before he netted twice in a 3–0 victory over AFC Wimbledon at Vale Park on 5 February 2013. On 12 March, he picked up an ankle injury that kept him out of action until the last day of the season. Vale secured promotion with a third-place finish at the end of the season, with Vincent scoring eight goals in 40 appearances. He was offered a new two-year contract, but chose to reject the offer and to search for a new club.
Return to Cheltenham Town.
Vincent was linked with a move to Notts County, and also had a trial with Scottish Premier League side Motherwell. He re-signed with Cheltenham Town – now in League Two and managed by Mark Yates – on a one-year deal in July 2013. He said the move was a 'homecoming' for him.
Style of play.
Vincent can play as a winger, but prefers a more central attacking role. In either position he likes to exploit his pace to run at defenders. As a striker he is often used alongside a target man.

Oliver Popplewell

The Honourable Sir Oliver Bury Popplewell (born 15 August 1927) is a former British judge. He chaired the inquiry into the Bradford City stadium fire, presided over the libel case brought by Jonathan Aitken MP against "The Guardian" newspaper which eventually led to Aitken's imprisonment for perjury, and was widely reported for asking "What is Linford's lunchbox?" during a case over which he was presiding, brought by Linford Christie. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and was president of the MCC from 1994 until 1996. He wrote a book about his legal career.
Personal life.
Popplewell was born in Northwood, Middlesex. His father, aged 47 when Oliver was born, was a civil servant in the Board of Trade. A widower, Sir Oliver remarried fellow-barrister Dame Elizabeth Gloster in March 2008. He is the father of four sons, the eldest of whom is the Cambridge University and Somerset cricketer, Nigel Popplewell, and another of whom (Andrew) is also a High Court Judge. He has 13 grandchildren among whom is the actress Anna Popplewell.
Education.
Popplewell went to Charterhouse School as a scholar, where he played cricket with Peter May and future politician Jim Prior, and after spending two years of National Service in the Royal Navy, he went to Queens' College, Cambridge as an exhibitioner. He was awarded a BA degree in 1950 and an LL.B. in 1951.
In 2003, Popplewell became one of the oldest mature students at the University of Oxford when he started reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Harris Manchester College.
Cricket.
Popplewell was a right-handed wicket-keeper-batsman, playing 56 innings in 41 matches, scoring 881 runs for an average of 20.46 including two half-centuries. He played for Cambridge University from 1949 until 1951 at the time when Rev DS Sheppard was playing for the University, for MCC in 1953, and for the Free Foresters from 1952 until 1960. His only bowling stint was three balls for MCC against Cambridge University in 1953. He was president of the MCC from 1994 to 1996.
Legal career.
Popplewell was called to the bar in 1951. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1969. After serving as Recorder of Burton upon Trent and Deputy Chairman of Oxfordshire Quarter Sessions, he was appointed as Recorder of the Crown Court in 1971. He was a High Court judge from 1983 until 2003. During this time, he chaired the Bradford Inquiry into Crowd Control and Safety at Sports Grounds in 1985. He became president of the Employment Appeal Tribunal and vice-chairman of the Parole Board in 1986, and a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators in 1996.
Cases.
In 1975 he defended his godson Stephen Fry, who was 18 at the time, at his trial for credit card fraud. Popplewell and his wife had long been friends of Fry's parents. Stephen Fry writes about the event in his autobiography "Moab Is My Washpot".
Following the fire at Valley Parade, the Bradford City stadium, on 11 May 1985, Popplewell was chosen to chair an inquiry held under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. Following this inquiry, he was chosen to chair a Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds. In 1999, he donated the papers of the inquiry to the University of Bradford.
A copy of the "Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds' Interim Report" has been published online in PDF format by the Bradford City Fire website.
He presided over the libel case brought by Jonathan Aitken against "The Guardian" and Granada Television.
While presiding over the High Court case brought by the athlete Linford Christie against former criminal John McVicar, the editor of Spike magazine, he was widely reported as asking, "What is Linford's lunchbox?". He later claimed that this was intended as a joke. The question was in the tradition of British jurisprudence, in which the judge asks seemingly inane questions relevant to the facts of the case on the assumption that the jury, which cannot ask questions, is ignorant of them. Following this case, the name "Mr Justice Cocklecarrot" was revived by "Private Eye" magazine (it was originally the name of a character in the Beachcomber column in the "Daily Express") which became the magazine's generic name for unworldly and out-of-touch judges, though Popplewell asserts that this description did not apply to him.
He upheld Reynold's privilege, established in the House of Lords in Reynolds v Times Newspapers in 1999, in an action against the "Yorkshire Post" for reporting that a local karate company was selling "rip-off" lessons.
Since he retired, Popplewell has spoken up for the right of judges to impose the sentences they see fit. He had an argument with Home Secretary David Blunkett who was seeking to introduce mandatory minimum sentences for some serious crimes.
Hillsborough controversy.
On 19 October 2011 he sparked fury by calling on the Liverpool families involved in the Hillsborough disaster to behave more like the relatives of victims of the Bradford City stadium disaster. He made the comments in a letter to "The Times" following the Commons debate on 17 October 2011 calling for all Cabinet papers on Hillsborough to be released. He said: "The citizens of Bradford behaved with quiet dignity and great courage. They did not harbour conspiracy theories. They did not seek endless further inquiries". His letter was published by the Times sister paper, "The Sun", which is boycotted on Merseyside, the day after it was revealed to Parliament that senior policemen had changed the evidence of junior policemen whose evidence contradicted the official version given to the press by police spokesmen. Popplewell was widely criticised for his comments, including a rebuke from a survivor of the Bradford stadium disaster.

Hristo Stambolski

Hristo Tanev Stambolski (1843 – 1932) was a Bulgarian physician, revolutionary, statesman, and an important figure of the Bulgarian National Revival. He was the first to translate medical terminology from Arabic to Turkish.
Biography.
Hristo (or Christo) Stambolski was born on August 8, 1843 in Kazanlak Bulgaria which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire. He was the first child of Stoencho Stambologlu, a teacher, and his wife Dafina. On August 14, 1852, the vigil of the Assumption of Mary, he was arrested because he helped the priest to use the new Semantron. At the request of influential Christians living in Kazanlak he was released. After this event he started thinking about a free Bulgaria.
He began his post-secondary education in Kazanlak and in 1858 transferred to the Imperial Medical School in Istanbul, which trained surgeons for the Ottoman army. It was during this time that his interest in infectious diseases began. While still a student he helped treat victims of the Istanbul cholera epidemic of 1865., In 1867 Istanbul saw an outbreak of typhus and for his work during this epidemic he was awarded the Turkish Medjidie-Medal.
He became well known in Istanbul and knew many influential persons. He then used this as an opportunity to take a role in the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian church. He was a member of the temporary counsel of the Bulgarian Exarchate and president of the Bulgarian chitalishte in Istanbul. He worked not only with the supporters of the church struggle, including Ilarion Makariopolski, but also with the revolutionaries Georgi Rakovski and Vassil Levski. In 1877 he was exiled to Yemen, where he described the disease Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease).
After the liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 he returned to Kazanlak and became a deputy in the parliament of East Rumelia. In 1881 he was minister of the postal services and road traffic. During Stefan Stambolov's rule he was placed under house arrest. Later he worked in the Aleksandrovska University Hospital and wrote the book "Old Bulgarian History".

Ostend 1907 chess tournament

The tournament was divided into two sections: the Championship Tournament and the Masters' Tournament. The first section was for players who had previously won an international tournament. The Championship Tournament took place in the Casino of Ostend from 16 May to 14 June 1907. Dawid Janowski, Siegbert Tarrasch, Carl Schlechter, and Frank Marshall had accepted the invitation for the tournament. Emanuel Lasker and Géza Maróczy declined and were replaced by Amos Burn and Mikhail Chigorin. The time restriction was 30 moves in two hours and 15 moves in one hour. Tarrasch won the golden medal and 2603½ francs. Schlechter became second and gained 2277½ francs.
In the Ostend tournament of 1907 the term "grandmaster" (actually "Großmeister" in German) was used, so these players were described as grandmasters for the purposes of the tournament. After winning the tournament, Tarrasch was crowned the "World Champion Tournament Player" by the tournament organizers.
Lasker finally agreed to a title match in 1908, and beat Tarrasch convincingly (+8 –3 =5).
The Masters' Tournament was a twenty nine-player round-robin. It was played from 16 May to 25 June. Ossip Bernstein and Akiba Rubinstein ended equal as winners at "Ostend B".

Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, music critic Bruce Eder called the album "his most affecting folk-style record, with unexpectedly warm vocals matched to the quiet virtuosity of his playing... This album was a great showcase for Watson's voice — vaguely similar to but rougher-hewn than Burl Ives — which is often overlooked in the aura of his playing."

George Taylforth

George Henry Taylforth (born 25 January 1941 in Liverpool, England) is a British-born Australian former professional rugby league player for Canterbury-Bankstown and Cronulla-Sutherland, notable for his long-range goal-kicking. He attended Sydney Boys High School playing alongside 1991 World Cup Winning Australia rugby union coach Bob Dwyer and premiership winning St. George Dragons rugby-league halfback George Evans (1962, 1963, 1964, 1965). He was also coached by former NSW rugby league representative Frank O'Rourke (rugby league) at school.
Playing career.
Taylforth was graded to St. George in 1961 and played in three consecutive winning reserve-grade grand finals from 1962 to 1964 but he was unable to break into the first-grade side. In 1965, Taylforth moved to Canterbury and he was team captain in 1966. 
St. George's run of eleven straight premierships came to an end in 1967 when Canterbury defeated them by 12–11 in the preliminary final. Taylforth contributed three goals to the Canterbury score. In the 1967 Grand Final, Canterbury lost to South Sydney 12–10, with Taylforth scoring eight of the ten points from four goals. In the 1967 season, Taylforth scored 204 points and became the first Canterbury player to score more than 200 points in one season.
Taylforth signed with Cronulla-Sutherland in 1970 and spent three seasons with the club. In his first season with the club, Taylforth once again scored more than 200 points - 202 - a record that stood for thirty years until Mat Rogers scored 212 points in the 2000 season.
Police career.
Joining the New South Wales Police Force in 1960, Taylforth (as Detective Chief Inspector) went on to command the Gaming Squad in 1987. Taylforth was a witness at the ICAC's investigation into the "Relationship Between Police and Criminals" between 1992 and 1994. The Gaming Squad was disbanded in 1993 as a result of the Commission's findings.

Bone Symphony EP

Bone Symphony EP is an EP by Bone Symphony released in 1983. It was their only commercial release.
Track listing.
Bone Symphony had a successful Dance hit in Europe with the single from their Bone Symphony EP "It's a Jungle Out There", and yet the group is best known for "One Foot in Front of The Other" from the movie "Revenge of The Nerds". The eponymous 1983 Bone Symphony EP (Capitol Records) was their first and only album. 
The album lost the punchy techno-garage sound found in the group's live performances in Hollywood - the production was smoother, fatter and more commercial, much like many of the dance records of the day. This was due largely to the replacement of the original Roland 808 and Linn drum machines by the incredibly talented drummer Robert Williams (Captain Beefheart, PIL). 
Sadly, the much more "techno" demos are now lost.

<doc id="18594838" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18594838" title="Louis Rhead">
Louis Rhead

Louis John Rhead (November 6, 1857 – July 29, 1926) was an English-born American artist, illustrator, author and angler who was born in Etruria, Staffordshire, England. He emigrated to the United States at the age of twenty-four.
Early life.
The Rhead family had operated and worked in the Staffordshire Potteries for at least three generations. Louis’s father George W. Rhead worked in the pottery industry and was highly respected gilder and ceramic artist. In the 1870s, George Rhead taught art and design in Staffordshire schools. He founded Fenton School of Art.
Louis and all his siblings attended their father’s art classes and worked in the potteries as children. His brothers Frederick Alfred Rhead and George Woolliscroft Rhead Jr. (1855–1920) were also artistic, and Louis, later in his career, sometimes collaborated with them, for example in book-illustration projects. Louis was also the uncle of the potters Charlotte Rhead and Frederick Hurten Rhead.
Because Louis demonstrated exceptional talent, when he was thirteen in 1872, his father sent him to study in Paris, France with artist Gustave Boulanger. After three years in Paris, Louis Rhead returned to work in the potteries as a ceramic artist at Minton and later at Wedgwood. In 1879 he gained a scholarship at the National Art Training School, South Kensington, London. After graduating from South Kensington in 1881, Louis Rhead worked briefly for Wedgwood and worked for the London publisher Cassell.
U.S. career.
In 1883 at the age of twenty-four, Louis Rhead was offered a position as Art Director for the U.S. publishing firm of D. Appleton in New York City. He accepted and emigrated to the U.S. in the fall of 1883. In 1884 he married Catherine Bogart Yates, thus becoming an American citizen. Louis and Catherine lived in Flatbush overlooking Prospect Park for forty years.
In the early 1890s, Rhead became a prominent poster artist and was heavily influenced by the work of Swiss artist Eugène Grasset. During the poster craze of the early 1890s, Rhead’s poster art appeared regularly in Harper's Bazaar, Harper's Magazine, St. Nicolas, Century Magazine, Ladies Home Journal and Scribner's Magazine. In 1895 he won a Gold Medal for "Best American Poster Design" at the first International Poster Show in Boston.
By the late 1890s, the popularity of poster art declined and Rhead turned his skills to book illustration. Between 1902 and his death in 1926, Rhead illustrated numerous children's books published by Harpers and others. Most notable among these were editions of: "Robin Hood", "The Swiss Family Robinson", "Robinson Crusoe", "The Deerslayer", "Treasure Island", "Kidnapped" and "Heidi".
Angling.
Rhead was an avid fly fisher and by his own account started fishing for trout in the U.S. sometime between 1888 and 1890. In 1901 he became interested in angling art and much of his later published works deal with fishing and fly fishing. Rhead was also tackle dealer and sold his own line of artificial flies. His most famous and celebrated work is "American Trout-Stream Insects" (1916). At the time of its publication this was one of the first and most comprehensive studies of stream entomology ever published in America.
Paul Schullery in "American Fly Fishing—A History" (1987) says this about Rhead:
Louis Rhead was one of the most creative, fresh-thinking, and stimulating of American fly-fishing writers, a man of extraordinary gifts. ... his major effort was "American Trout Stream Insects", a book based on several years of trout fishing in the Catskills.
Death.
Louis Rhead's death was somewhat unusual. He died from a heart attack at his retirement home in Amityville, Long Island. A portion of his obituary in "The New York Times", Friday July 30, 1926:
LOUIS RHEAD, ARTIST AND ANGLER, DEAD. Exhausted Recently by Long Struggle In Capturing a 30-pound Turtle.
...About two weeks ago Mr. Rhead set out to catch a turtle weighing thirty pounds which had been devastating trout ponds on his place, Seven Oaks. After the turtle was hooked, it put up a fight for more than half an hour. Although Mr. Rhead was successful in the end, he became exhausted. A short time later he suffered from his first attack of heart disease. Yesterday's was his second.
Exhibition.
Bernard Bumpus (1921–2004) was the leading authority on the Rhead family. In the 1980s Bumpus curated an exhibition "Rhead Artists and Potters" at the Geffrye Museum in London, which mainly featured works of art by the Rhead family, but also included examples of Louis Rhead's flies. It toured several UK Museums including the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Staffordshire. Bumpus hoped to take a version of the exhibition to the USA, but, despite American interest in the Rhead family, this project foundered.
Bibliography.
In the early 20th century, Rhead was a prolific contributor of angling articles in the sporting press--"The American Angler," "Outing Magazine", "Field & Stream", and "Forest and Stream"

Trevorton Bridge

The Trevorton Bridge was a wooden covered bridge that crossed the Susquehanna River. It was erected between Herndon, Pennsylvania in Northumberland County and Port Trevorton in Snyder County. The bridge was long, with a trestle leading up to it. It was originally built as a railroad bridge by the Trevorton and Susquehanna Railroad and, in 1885, the bridge was adapted for use as a road bridge as well as for trains. The bridge was most often used to cross the Susquehanna by cattle. The continuous crossing of cattle endangered the already weakened bridge (weakened from acid in the bark the pine used to construct the bridge). The bridge was eventually dismantled for fear that it collapse.

Before the Ruin is a collaborative studio album by Scottish folk musicians Kris Drever, John McCusker and Roddy Woomble, released 15 September 2008 through Navigator Records. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at #156 and the Scottish Albums chart at #45. The album was originally scheduled for a May release, but was delayed due to McCusker touring with Mark Knopfler.
The album features appearances from Radiohead drummer Phil Selway, and Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake.
"Silver and Gold" was released as a single on 1 September 2008.
Speaking of the album, McCusker notes that their "paths had all crossed in various ways over the past few years - working with Kate Rusby, and on Kris and Roddy's solo albums - and our starting-point was basically just that we all really liked each other's stuff." Woomble notes that: "Kris and John each have such a different take on things like melody and lyrics, but we’re all working equally on the songs together, so the whole thing feels totally new. And it’s great getting to make another ‘first’ album at our age."
Artwork.
The album cover is by Orcadian painter Charles Shearer, and is said to "describe the physical, and metaphorical pull of the ocean, which is also a main theme of the record."

Betsy Gray

Betsy Gray (died 1798), was an Ulster-Scots Presbyterian peasant girl from outside Lisburn in Co. Antrim in what is today Northern Ireland who was killed as part of the 1798 Rebellion of the United Irishmen. She is the subject of many folk ballads and poems written since her time down to the present day. 
She fought in the Battle of Ballynahinch against the Yeomanry, and was killed in retreat along with her brother and lover, having her right hand cut off before being decapitated.
She is a folk hero to all Republicans in Ulster, with both loyalists and republicans claiming her as their own, as typified by the centenary celebrations in 1898 where locals broke a monument to her sooner than let Nationalists, who travelled from Belfast, have a ceremony in her honour.
Betsy Gray Cup.
Today the Betsy Gray Cup is awarded by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in her memory in Ulster.

Betsy was featured in a novel which was semi-historical by Wesley Guard Lyttle, owner of a local newspaper "The Down Herald".

Early life.
Allen was born in Fort Worth, Texas. He first started to dance in third grade, at the age of 8. One of his early influences was Michael Jackson, whom Allen emulated by doing the Moonwalk. He also excelled at sports and played football and track. After changing high schools, however, Allen decided to focus on his first love: dance.
"So You Think You Can Dance" Season 4.
On "So You Think You Can Dance", he was paired up with Katee Shean, Courtney Galiano, Chelsie Hightower, and Stephen "tWitch" Boss.

FC Zenit Boyarka

Inter Boyarka was a Ukrainian football club that last played in Boyarka, Kiev Oblast during Ukrainian Second League 2006-07 season.
Originally the club was based in Borodianka, Kiev Oblast and they had several name changes in their existence.
In 1992 the club originally was known as Hart, based on the Central Sports Club "Hart" of Ministry of Education, competed at the Amateur level and were champions in the 3rd Zone of the Ukrainian KFK competition. This was the entrance criterion for the club to enter the professional ranks. The next season they entered the Ukrainian Third League.
Before the 1994/1995 season the club renamed themselves to Systema-Boreks Borodianka for which they were better known while they competed in the professional leagues. With reasonable success the club spent 2 seasons in the Ukrainian First League. Before the 2004/5 season the club was renamed as Osvita Borodianka.
In 2005 with the club struggling financially and on the football arena they moved to Boyarka, Kiev Oblast and renamed themselves as Boyarka-2006 Boyarka. This did not help as the club after the 2007 season folded.
