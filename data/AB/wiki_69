Taylor Hall

Taylor Strba Hall (born November 14, 1991) is a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger and alternate captain currently playing for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was the first overall pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. Hall has had a highly successful junior career, helping the Windsor Spitfires to two consecutive Memorial Cup championships in 2009 and 2010. He was named Most Valuable Player of the Memorial Cup tournament both years. Hall's agent is former NHL defenceman Bobby Orr. 
On July 5, 2010, Hall signed his first professional contract with the Edmonton Oilers.
Early life.
Hall was born in Calgary, Alberta, he is the son of Steve Hall and Kim Strba. His father was a former Canadian Football League player for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Toronto Argonauts and Ottawa Rough Riders in the mid-1980s, after which he was a member of the Canadian national bobsleigh team. His mother introduced him to organized hockey at the age of five while his father maintained a backyard rink every winter which Hall and his friends practiced on relentlessly. His family moved to Kingston, Ontario, in 2005, where he attended high school at Frontenac Secondary School.
Playing career.
Minor.
Hall started playing minor hockey in Calgary, Alberta. When he was 13, his family moved to Kingston, Ontario, where he continued to play. Hall captured a Bantam AAA Calgary city championship with the North East Canucks during the 2004–05 season. In 2005–06 and 2006–07 Hall played Bantam and Minor Midget hockey for the Greater Kingston Predators of the ODMHA league. Hall was named to the ODMHA Midget AAA All-Star team. After the season, Hall was the second overall choice in the 2007 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection by the Windsor Spitfires. Ryan O'Reilly was selected first overall ahead of Hall by the Erie Otters.
Junior.
Hall made his OHL debut in 2007–08, scoring a team-high 45 goals and adding 39 assists for 84 points, which was third in team scoring. In March, he was named OHL player of the week twice (March 3 and March 10). He was named OHL and CHL Rookie of the Year after the season.
During the 2008–09 OHL season, Hall was selected to represent the OHL in the ADT Canada-Russia Challenge. He scored 38 goals and added 52 assists to finish with 90 points. Windsor had a successful season on the ice, capturing the OHL Championship as well as the Memorial Cup. During the OHL playoffs, Hall scored 16 goals and added 20 assists while being awarded the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as Playoff MVP. He scored the game winning overtime goal in the fifth and deciding game of the OHL Finals against the Brampton Battalion to clinch the title. At the 2009 Memorial Cup, Hall recorded 8 points in 6 games, as the Spitfires defeated the Kelowna Rockets4–1 in the final. After the tournament, Hall was awarded the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as Tournament MVP and was named to the Tournament All-Star Team along with his teammate Ryan Ellis.
Though the odds of him playing in Russia were remote, Hall was drafted 89th overall by the Kontinental Hockey League's Ak Bars Kazan on June 1, 2009. He was one of three Canadian junior players (all from the OHL) taken in the 2009 KHL Draft, which begins selecting players a year younger than the NHL does. Hall was an early favourite to be the top pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft since entering the junior ranks. He was praised early in his junior career on "Hockey Night in Canada" by commentator Don Cherry during his "Coach's Corner" segment. He was also featured in a July 2008 issue of "Sports Illustrated", profiling young athletes poised to star in their sports.
Hall finished the 2009–10 OHL season tied for first place in the OHL with Tyler Seguin with 106 points (40 goals and 66 assists) to win the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy alongside Seguin. Hall was instrumental in the Spitfires' 2010 J. Ross Robertson Cup championship, recording a playoff-leading 35 points in 19 post-season games. His teammate, Adam Henrique, won the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award, scoring 20 goals.
In May 2010, Hall helped lead the Windsor Spitfires to their second straight Memorial Cup. With the victory, Hall was awarded his second straight Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as tournament MVP, the first player in its history to repeat as a winner, the Ed Chynoweth Trophy as Memorial Cup scoring leader, and a spot on the tournament All-Star team for the second straight year.
Hall was ranked as the top North American prospect by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau (CSB) in its 2009–10 midterm rankings. In the CSB's final rankings, he was overtaken by Tyler Seguin as the top ranked North American prospect. He has cited New York Islanders forward and 2009 NHL Entry Draft first overall pick, John Tavares, as a role model, both on and off the ice.
Professional.
Shortly after being selected first overall by the Edmonton Oilers in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, Hall signed his first professional contract. The contract pays Hall the entry level maximum of $900,000 with the possibility of an additional $2.85 million in performance bonuses. This is the highest rookie contract in Oilers history.
Taylor Hall has been given permission to wear the jersey number 4 which had belonged to former Oilers' player, Kevin Lowe, now serving as the president of hockey operations, who, before Hall, had been the only Oiler to ever wear the number 4 in its NHL history.
Hall made his NHL debut on October 7, 2010, as the Oilers defeated arch-rivals, the Calgary Flames at Rexall Place.
Hall's first NHL point, an assist, came in his second game, against the Florida Panthers on October 10, 2010, Shawn Horcoff redirected Hall's shot in front of the net. His first NHL goal came on October 28, 2010, against Steve Mason of the Columbus Blue Jackets and his former coach with the Windsor Spitfires, Bob Boughner.
Hall came in second place to Michael Grabner in the fastest skater, in the 2011 NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition.
Hall got his first NHL hat-trick and natural hat-trick against the Atlanta Thrashers on February 19, 2011. With the Oilers down two goals, Hall scored 3 consecutive power play goals in a span of 12:53 to win the game by a score of 5-3.
On March 3, 2011, Hall recorded his first career Gordie Howe hat trick on a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Hall scored a goal against Steve Mason, assisted on a goal by Jordan Eberle, and fought with Derek Dorsett, in a 4-2 win. The fight with Dorsett, however, ended his rookie season early as Hall suffered a high ankle sprain at the end of the fight. Hall finished his rookie season scoring 22 goals and 20 assists in 65 games.
Hall recorded his second career NHL hat-trick in a 9-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks after going 9 games without a goal.
On January 17, 2012, Hall was sliced by teammate Corey Potter's skate before a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets during warmup, resulting in a deep cut to his face that required 30 stitches to close.
It was announced that Hall would need major shoulder surgery and would need 5 to 6 months to recover, ending his successful sophomore year. Despite missing 21 games, Hall was still tied for fifth for power play goals.
On August 21, 2012, Hall signed a seven-year extension with the Oilers worth 42 million dollars for an average of 6 million a year.
On January 26, 2013, Hall recorded his 100th career point, with 2 assists in a 4-3 loss against arch-rivals Calgary Flames.
On February 22, 2013, Hall was given a 2 game suspension after a collision with Minnesota's forward Cal Clutterbuck.
On March 30, 2013, Hall set a new franchise record, by scoring a hat trick 7:53 into the game.
Hall finished the 2012–13 within the top 10 in league scoring, finish 9th. Also recording a career high of 34 assists which was good enough for 8th in NHL scoring.
On October 17, 2013, Hall broke Wayne Gretzky's previous record of two goals in nine second by scoring two in eight. Gretzky congratulated him shortly after.
International play.
Hall represented Canada at the 2008 IIHF World U18 Championships in Kazan, Russia as one of five 16-year-olds. He was fifth in tournament scoring, with nine points in seven games, helping Canada to a gold medal. He returned to Canada's under-18 team to earn a second gold medal at the 2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament in Slovakia as an alternate captain to Matt Duchene.
Hall made Canada's national junior team for the 2010 World Junior Championships in Saskatchewan. He was the lone draft-eligible player selected to the final roster. Hall scored a hat-trick against Slovakia, in a game Canada ended up winning 8–2. After the championships, Hall finished tied for third overall in scoring with his Canadian teammate and Alex Pietrangelo along with American, Jerry D'Amigo. He ended up with 6 goals and 6 assists (12 points) in 6 games.
Hall was invited to Hockey Canada's summer evaluation camp for the 2011 World Junior Tournament, but declined to participate, choosing instead to focus on making the Oilers' roster for the upcoming season. According to Hockey Canada policy, Hall would have been ineligible to participate in the tournament even if he was available.

Selberg sieve

In mathematics, in the field of number theory, the Selberg sieve is a technique for estimating the size of "sifted sets" of positive integers which satisfy a set of conditions which are expressed by congruences. It was developed by Atle Selberg in the 1940s.
Description.
In terms of sieve theory the Selberg sieve is of "combinatorial type": that is, derives from a careful use of the inclusion-exclusion principle. Selberg replaced the values of the Möbius function which arise in this by a system of weights which are then optimised to fit the given problem. The result gives an "upper bound" for the size of the sifted set.
Let "A" be a set of positive integers ≤ "x" and let "P" be a set of primes. For each "p" in "P", let "A""p" denote the set of elements of "A" divisible by "p" and extend this to let "A""d" the intersection of the "A""p" for "p" dividing "d", when "d" is a product of distinct primes from "P". Further let A1 denote "A" itself. Let "z" be a positive real number and "P"("z") denote the product of the primes in "P" which are ≤ "z". The object of the sieve is to estimate
We assume that |"A""d"| may be estimated by 
where "f" is a multiplicative function and "X"   =   |"A"|. Let the function "g" be obtained from "f" by Möbius inversion, that is
where μ is the Möbius function. 
Put
Then
It is often useful to estimate "V"("z") by the bound

Clay Graham

Clay Graham is an American comedy writer, television producer and website creator, best known for his work on "The Drew Carey Show".
Early years.
Born in Phoenix, Arizona, Graham began writing comedy in high school, selling material to humorist Robert Orben for seven dollars a joke. While still in college, he wrote for "Mad" magazine, creating scripts for artist Don Martin.
Writing career.
Soon after graduation, Graham was hired as a writer on the sitcom "Benson". 
After this, he worked as a writer and producer on the last three seasons of the long-running ABC comedy, "Who's the Boss?". During this period, Graham wrote "The All-Nighter," an episode still somewhat controversial among fans of the sitcom because of its relatively dark themes. 
In 1995, Graham became the head writer and an executive producer of "The Drew Carey Show". He remained on the show for eight of its nine seasons, producing more than 200 episodes. He produced and helped write many of the series' trademark musical numbers, as well as its annual "live" broadcasts. In 1998, Graham and Drew Carey took a small production crew overseas and became the first Americans to film a sitcom in China, using locations such as The Great Wall and the Beijing McDonald's. 
In April 2009, TBS announced at its upfront that it was developing a prime-time, animated comedy series with Graham called "Big Tow." 
The New York Times published an essay by Graham in its Modern Love column on July 8, 2010 titled "What Clown Wrote This Script?' detailing Graham's relationship with an unnamed actress for whom he developed a TV pilot a decade earlier. Although comic in tone, the essay explores Graham's inner struggles about mixing business and romance and ends on a bittersweet note.
Website.
In 2007, Graham began developing MrsP.com, a new entertainment website for children. Co-created with Kathy Kinney, who played "Mimi" on "The Drew Carey Show" and who also stars as "Mrs. P" in the site, and Dana Plautz, a former executive with Hanna-Barbera and Intel, the comic website celebrates reading and launched on November 10, 2008.

Red factor canary

The red factor canary is a popular variety of canary. It is named after its colourful plumage, and is a 'color canary', bred for the novelty of its color rather than for song. It is kept by those who want a pet as well as those who enjoy showing. 
It is an active bird, hardy and very easy to keep; however it is not easy to breed.
First bred in the 1930s, it is the only colour canary that has an element of red as part of its plumage. It was developed as a cross between another type of finch, the now endangered Venezuelan Black Hooded Red ("Siskin Spinus cocullatus"), and a yellow Domestic Canary ("Serinus canaria").
A well built bird, the red factor canary is about in length. These canaries are bred for showing so therefore many versions of this canary exist today. They are divided into Melanins and the Lipochromes classes. These are further divided into frosts or non-frosts, which affects how bright their color appears, and then into hard and soft feathers.
Red ractor canaries are usually available at most pet stores, and can also be found through bird shows, bird clubs, breeders, and on the internet.

Lietuvos skautų sąjunga

Lietuvos skautų sąjunga (LSS, "Scout Association of Lithuania") is one of Lithuania's Scouting organizations. The organization serves about 1,300 members (as of 2008).
Ideals.
Lithuania Scout Association is unpolitical, non-profit making freewill driven youth organization. The aim of Lithuania Scout Association is to educate our members to be honest, high-minded, conscious citizens with the guidance of Robert Baden-Powell’s methods.
History.
LSS claims to be the oldest Scouting organization in Lithuania. Its predecessor was established in 1930, although there are some opinions that it happened much earlier, in 1918, but that was only the embryo phase.
In 1918, Petras Jurgėlas-Jurgelevicius established the first Scout troop in Lithuania. In 1922, the first general assembly united the Lithuanian Scout Movement into the first Scout Association of Lithuania (SAL). This date could be argued as the year of establishment of Scout Association of Lithuania, for in 1930 when the law of Lithuanian Scouting Association (LSA) became effective all other organizations were united under the new name. 
After Russia occupied Lithuania, Lithuania Scout Association was suspended, but rehabilitated in 1988 in Vilnius.
Scout Motto.
The Scout Motto is "Budek", translating as "Be Prepared" in Lithuanian. The Lithuanian noun for a single Scout is "Skautas".

Mímameiðr

In Norse mythology, Mímameiðr (Old Norse "Mimi's tree") is a tree whose branches stretch over every land, is unharmed by fire or metal, bears fruit that assists pregnant women, and upon whose highest bough roosts the cock Víðópnir. Mímameiðr is solely attested in the Old Norse poem "Fjölsvinnsmál". Due to parallels between descriptions of the two, scholars theorize that "Mímameiðr" may be another name for the world tree Yggdrasil, and also Hoddmímis holt, a wood in within which Líf and Lífthrasir are foretold to take refuge during the events of Ragnarök. "Mímameiðr" is sometimes modernly anglicized as Mimameid or Mimameith.
"Fjölsvinnsmál".
Mímameiðr is mentioned in stanzas of the eddic-meter poem "Fjölsvinnsmál", where the tree is described as having limbs that stretch over every land, bearing helpful fruit, and as harboring the cock Víðópnir. The first mention occurs when Svipdagr asks Fjölsviðr to tell him what the name of the tree whose branches reach over every land. Fjolsvith responds that:
This stanza is followed by another where Svipdagr asks Fjölsviðr what grows from the seed of the tree. Fjölsviðr responds that fruit grows from the tree:
In the notes to his translation of this stanza, Bellows comments this stanza is to be understood as explaining that, when cooked, the fruit of Mímameiðr—which he identifies as Yggdrasil—will assure safe childbirth.
A third mention occurs when Svipdagr tells Fjölsviðr to tell him what the name of the glittering, golden cock is that sits "on the highest bough". Fjölsviðr complies, revealing that the cock is named Víðópnir:
Theories.
Scholar Rudolf Simek connects Mímameiðr with Mímisbrunnr ("Mímir's well"), which is located beneath one of the three roots of the cosmological tree Yggdrasil. Simek concludes that due to the location of the well, "Mímameiðr" is potentially another name for Yggdrasil. In addition, Simek says that Hoddmímis holt ("Hoard-Mímir's" holt)—a wood whose name refers to the same figure and wherein Líf and Lífþrasir survive Ragnarök—may also be another name for Yggdrasil, and therefore is likely the same location as Mímameiðr.
Scholar John Lindow concurs, noting that if the figures within the location names are the same, then the identification of all the locations as within close vicinity is likely.

Norfolk Biffin

The Norfolk Biffin (sometimes spelt Norfolk Beefing) is a local apple cultivar originating from the English county of Norfolk.
'Beefing' is thought to be a corruption of biffin.
Description.
Norfolk Biffins, or Beefings, are round, slightly flat, apples about three inches across and two and a half inches high (about seven by six centimetres). The skin is yellow-green, but with brown-purple and dark red streaks. Inside, the flesh has a green tint, is crisp, and is said to have a hint of the flavour of cinnamon. The apples store well, getting sweeter with keeping, and are good for cooking and drying. By March of the year after harvesting, they are sweet enough to use as dessert apples. With keeping, they turn a deeper brown or maroon colour, with harder, more solid flesh.
These apples were popular with Norwich bakers and were sent to London fruiterers as a delicacy. They were also used for cider making.
The trees are vigorous, with heavy crops of fruit. Some thinning is necessary in good years.
Biffins.
Biffins are a special kind of dried Norfolk Biffin, flat in appearance and soft to the touch, prepared in large quantities in Norfolk, England. They are obtained by a very slow drying of the fruit and occasional pressing. These were baked in cooling bread ovens under weights to flatten and then sold cold.
These were slowly cooked whole, then cored, then rubbed with sugar. To eat, you would peel off the tough skin, and garnish with more sugar and cream. You would eat them cold or room temperature. Very popular in Victorian times but largely died out commercially after World War II. In Asia, the large native persimmon is treated to a processing and flattening to be used in cooking reminiscent of the Biffin.
History.
The Norfolk Biffin is an apple variety grown over some three hundred years, often for drying to make 'biffins' ("viz.", "a baked apple flattened in the form of a cake").
The estate records for Mannington, Norfolk, dating from 1698, of Robert Walpole (later the first Prime Minister of Great Britain) mention Norfolk Biffin apples which Walpole had sent up to his house in London. The apple is documented in the United States from the 1840s.
The Norfolk Biffin is also mentioned by Charles Dickens, first in "A Christmas Carol" (1843), later in "Dombey and Son" (1846-1848) and in "Boots at the Holly-tree Inn" (1858). The first of these says: "Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of oranges and lemons, and in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner". The last of these has: "Cobbs, do you think you could bring a biffin, please?... I think a Norfolk biffin would rouse her, Cobbs. She is very fond of them."
The Victorian food writer and poet Eliza Acton recommends the apple in her "Modern cookery, in all its branches" (1845) as the best apple to use when baking 'Black Caps par Excellence' (a sugared baked apple made with wine and lemon peel): "The Norfolk biffin answers for this dish far better than any other kind of apple".
A recipe for biffins of 1882 advises: "... choose Norfolk Biffins with the clearest most blemish free rinds, then lay them on clean straw on baking wire and cover well with more straw. Set them in a very slow oven for four to five hours. Draw them out and press them very gently, otherwise their skins will burst. Return them now to the oven for another hour, then press them again. When cold, rub them over with clarified sugar".
In Victorian London, there was a Christmas trade in biffins, supplied by Norwich bakers, who cooked the apples in their bread-ovens, weighed down with an iron plate to exclude air.
The apple is now only rarely seen in English orchards, having been widely replaced by such varieties as the Cox's Orange Pippin. However, it is still grown by gardeners for home consumption and the cultivar can still be bought commercially.

2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony

The 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony was held at the Beijing National Stadium, also known as the "Bird's Nest". It was directed by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on August 24, 2008. The number 8 is associated with prosperity and confidence in Chinese culture.
The Ceremony also included the handover of the games from Beijing to London. Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing, handed over the Olympic flag to the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. There was also a performance organized by the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG).
While the opening ceremony was described as an artistic and serious introduction of China's ancient past, the closing ceremony was described by Western media as "much more lighthearted", "silly" and "fun" than the opening ceremony.
By the end of the 16 days of NBC's coverage of the Beijing Olympics in the United States, it had also become the most-watched U.S. television event of all time, with over 211 million American viewers tuned into the Olympics on NBC according to the Nielsen Media Research; this is 2 million more than the 1996 Atlanta Games, the previous all-time record-holder.
Sequence of events.
Opening.
The countdown started from "29", indicating the 29th Summer Olympics. From "29" to "11", highlights of this Olympic Games were shown with countdown numbers on the screen. Accompanied by sound effects, the atmosphere reached its climax. Guided by volunteers, the entire audience counted down from 10, together. Both Arabic numerals and numbers written in Chinese characters appeared on the screen with typical patterns of minority ethnic groups as the background. The fireworks burst immediately when the countdown ended, forming a great circle in the sky which symbolized the success of the Beijing Olympic Games.
Hu Jintao entered the stadium, accompanied by Jacques Rogge. They were followed by the entrance of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife, Sarah. The People's Liberation Army prepared the national flag of China. The soldiers then carried the flag, in a slow, goose-stepping march, to the flag podium and the Chinese national anthem, March of the Volunteers, was sung by a 224-member choir while the flag was raised.
All lights were extinguished in the stadium. A video was played on the large screen in the north and south to explain the theme of the Closing Ceremony. The video reviewed the exciting and memorable moments during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. A grand celebration began:
Next, silver bell performers danced in time to the beat of the heavenly drums on the Main Stage to greet the guests.
Entrance of the flag bearers.
Led by guides and placard holders, the flag bearers of all delegations entered the stadium, divided into two groups. One group (1-102), headed by Greece as per tradition, entered from Gate 4 in alphabetical order and stood along the main stage. The other group (103-204), headed by Saudi Arabia, entered from Gate 3 and also stood along the main stage. The Chinese Flag bearer entered last and stood at the designated place. Greece entering first and China entering last symbolizing the first and the most recent Summer Olympics host nations.
After all flags were in position, the athletes entered the stadium in no particular order. All athletes entered from four gates without differentiation of nationality. While the athletes were entering, a women's percussion band and two children percussion players played cheerful music. The entire stadium was in raptures.
Finally, the medal-winning athletes entered the stadium.
Medal ceremony.
At this point, Samuel Wanjiru received his gold medal. He was very excited as he climbed to the first position. Three flags, including the flag of Kenya, were raised as the national anthem of Kenya was played.
Afterwards, twelve children led twelve representatives of volunteers to walk from Gate 2 to the stage. Then, four children led four new members of IOC Athletes' commission to walk together with four persons for the ceremony from Gate 1 to the Main Stage.
Speeches and lowering the Olympic flag.
The People's Liberation Army then enter the stadium, holding the national flag of Greece. While the Greek flag was being hoisted, the Greek national anthem "Hymn to Liberty" was performed. 
Count Rogge and Liu Qi walked to the main stage from the VIP corridor. During his speech, the Count praised the Chinese for their warm reception and effort. He also stated that the Beijing Games were "truly exceptional". Finally, he declared that the 2008 Olympic Games were officially closed.
Eight British Army personnel then entered the stadium, carrying the Union Flag. They passed the flag to soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. The flag was raised and the British national anthem God Save The Queen was played. Shortly thereafter, the soldiers slowly lowered the Olympic Flag and the Chinese and foreign youth singers sung the Olympic Anthem in Greek. As the soldiers exited, the fireworks erupted again, representing the Olympic rings. The Olympic flag was next raised again at the next Winter Olympic games in Vancouver; opening ceremony took place there on 12 February 2010.
The Olympic flag was handed from Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing, to Count Rogge, the President of the IOC. It was then handed to Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London.
Presentation of the 2012 Summer Olympics.
A demonstration entitled "From London, 'With a whole Lotta love." was then staged by the British. It featured the urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet and Candoco, a disabled dance group, all dressed as typical London commuters waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing, whilst Olympic Champions Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and Jamie Staff cycled around the stadium. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium to the music 'This is London' composed by Philip Sheppard and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, before eventually stopping and transforming into a privet hedge featuring famous London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Jimmy Page and Leona Lewis then performed the Led Zeppelin classic Whole Lotta Love and David Beckham kicked a football into the crowd of athletes accompanied by violinist Elspeth Hanson and cellist Kwesi Edman.
An airport electronic flight screen appeared on the large screen of the Stadium. An athlete about to leave walks up the boarding ladder and turns around affectionately. In special-effect lighting, the boarding ladder truck with the logo of Beijing Olympic Games is slowly elevated. He slowly takes out an exquisite painting scroll and unfolds it. In the dark, a huge mechanic device — the "memory tower" at the center of the field — rises slowly, with two "sports sculpture" performers standing on top of it and showing various athletic gestures.
The rim of the bowl changed into a red track. Special lights cast scenes of the 16 days from the lighting of the holy flame to now onto the track in the air. At the center of the field, two "sports sculpture" performers rise gradually and show different athletic gestures slowly in the air, conveying the noble Olympic spirit. The athlete on the boarding ladder looks at the burning flame in the distance, and slowly folds the painting scroll, just as the flame was about to be extinguished. A huge "holy flame" is lighted at the center of the field (396 "memory tower" performers simulate the flame with their bodies) as the Olympic flame took its final breath.
Later events.
The torch lights in the hands of the marshals and the 90,000 audience members were turned on at the same time. In the passionate far-reaching music, 16 lucky cloud yarn strips slowly rose along the "memory tower" on the main stage. The top ends of the lucky cloud yarn strips extended towards the sky and changed into a lucky cloud tree symbolizing friendship and joy.
The concert section started. Chinese singer Tan Jing, Hong Kong singer Kelly Chen, Han Xue, Taiwanese-American singer Wang Lee Hom and Korean singer Rain sing together "Beijing, Beijing, I Love Beijing", a song full of passion, vitality and energy.
Next, seven singers walked from below the steps to the Main Stage and sang "The Moon is Bright Tonight". Two Chinese and foreign singers on the mobile singing performance car went from Gate 1 to the front of the VIP corridor, and sang "The Flame of Love". Two singers on the main stage sang the joyous and passionate song "Surpass It".
At this point, there were 50 young singers together. At the same time, 75 aerobatic performers wearing luminous flight clothes performed elevation and rotation in the air.
During the final song "Please Stay, Guests from Afar", 50 male dancers holding Fuwa lucky cloud yarn strips and paper flower launchers and 120 other dancers danced on the Main Stage in tune with the rhythm of the song. Also, 600 female performers in festival clothes entered the stadium, flew around the athletes and danced with all athletes in the stadium and 1,046 marshals in tune with the rhythm of the song, forming a spectacular dance circle.
Finally, 600 female performers in festive clothes, 112 performers of minority ethnic groups, 50 male dancers, 70 collectors of launched red silk and 200 "memory tower" performers threw the Fuwa lucky cloud yarn strips into the stadium, interacting with the athletes. At the same time, innumerable dazzling fireworks were launched from the top of the "bowl rim". Then, numerous festival fireworks formed a huge circle of fireworks, symbolizing the successful conclusion of 2008 Summer Olympics. The closing ceremony ended at 9:55 pm CST.
Television.
Estimates of the global television audience varied: "around one billion" (Reuters), "experts estimated ... more than two billion" (Wall Street Journal), "2.3 billion" (MindShare), "Billions...probably the largest live television audience in history" (Bloomberg), "3 billion" (Sky News), "nearly 4 billion" (Xinhua, "as many as 4 billion" (Washington Post), "estimated 4 billion" (McClatchy). This included an estimated 842 million viewers watching on host Chinese broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), with polls ranging from 63 and 69 percent of the Chinese viewing population, exceeding that of the 51-58 percent who watch the network's annual closing ceremonies forms.

Association of Local Colleges and Universities

The Association of Local Colleges and Universities or simply ALCU is composed of thirty-three (33) local colleges and universities of the Philippines. ALCU is working closely with the Senate Committee on Education, which is headed by Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, in legislations that benefit existing local colleges and universities.
The primary thrust of ALCU is to improve the quality of instruction, research, and extension of its member schools and to provide value public tertiary education, especially to the poor and disadvantaged youth.
The Association has created in the later part of 2003 the Commission on Accreditation, Inc., which is working closely with the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines, Inc. (AACCUP).
During the investiture of Atty. Adel A. Tamano at the Justo Albert Auditorium of the PLM, he mentioned his plan of drafting the best-practices manual for local colleges and make it a project of the ALCU.
Accreditation and standards.
Together with the Accrediting Agencies of Chartered Colleges and Universities of the Philippines (AACCUP), the ALCUCOA formed the National Network of Quality Assurance Agencies (NNQAA) in 2004 to ensure the public of quality higher education among public higher educational institutions. With the help of AACCUP, Dr. Nida Africa, and the PAASCU executive director, ALCU member schools immerse themselves in quality assurance activities involving the following areas of accreditation. These include:
Many ALCU member schools are now aiming for accreditation to uplift the quality of their program offerings.
To uphold quality higher education, ALCU partnered with the Commission on Higher Education as part of the Technical Working Group that three ordinances namely CMO No. 32, series of 2006, and CMO Nos. 1 and 10, series 2005.

Anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan

The Anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan, "Nevada Semipalatinsk", was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major anti-nuclear movements in the former Soviet Union. It was led by author Olzhas Suleimenov and attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk in north-east Kazakhstan in 1991. The movement was named "Nevada Semipalatinsk" in order to show solidarity with similar movements in the United States aiming to close the Nevada Test Site.
The Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear weapons tests at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, between 1949 and 1989. The United Nations believes that one million people around Semipalatinsk were exposed to radiation, and the incidence of birth defects and cancer is much higher than for the rest of the country.
According to UNESCO, Nevada-Semipalatinsk played a positive role in promoting public understanding of "the necessity to fight against nuclear threats". The movement gained global support and, became "a real historical factor in finding solutions to global ecological problems".

1990 Major League Baseball lockout

The 1990 Major League Baseball lockout was the seventh work stoppage in baseball since 1972. Beginning in February, it lasted 32 days and as a result, virtually wiped out all of spring training. Also because of the lockout, Opening Day was moved back a week to April 9. In addition to this, the season had to be extended by three days in order to accommodate the normal 162-game schedule.
History.
Background.
The five-year Basic Agreement between the players and owners was set to expire on December 31, 1989. During the build up to the lockout, the two sides spent months trying to iron out long-standing disagreements over free agency and arbitration. By the end of the 1989 season, salaries for top players were already nearing the $3 million-a-year level. Desperate to stop the salary hike, the owners proposed an economic partnership in which revenue sharing would play a major role.
The owners' plan.
Therefore, the owners set forth a plan in which 48% of gate receipts and all revenue from local and network broadcasting would go toward paying player salaries. These salaries would be based on a pay-for-performance scale, in which players with less than six years of experience would be compensated based on a ranking against their peers. Perhaps most importantly, a salary cap would be placed on each club. In the process, there would be a stipulation put in place that teams reaching the said cap could make no more free agent signings or salary increases.
Owners claimed that under the plan, average player salaries would proceed to rise over 20% to $770,000 by the 1993 season. They cited rising attendance figures as well as solid television contracts with CBS and ESPN.
The MLBPA's response.
Although revenue sharing of this type had worked considerably well in the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) Executive Director Donald Fehr, feared that a salary cap would restrict the number of choices free agents could make. Also, Fehr argued that a pay-for-performance scale would eliminate multi-year contracts.
Resolution.
Commissioner Fay Vincent worked feverishly with both sides, and ultimately on March 19, a new Basic Agreement was reached. The minimum major league salary was raised from $68,000 to $100,000. Meanwhile, a six-man study committee on revenue sharing was established.

Field mill (carriage)

A field mill, also known as a camp mill, was a premodern vehicle which acted as a mobile mill used for grinding grains, which had the very practical use of feeding a moving army. It was first invented in China around 340 AD, although its use eventually died out, was invented separately in Europe by 1580, and then reentered China from Europe during the early 17th century.
History.
Later Zhao.
In the "Yezhongji" (鄴中記) ('Record of Affairs at the Capital of the Later Zhao Dynasty') by Lu Hui, covering the history of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD) court in China, the text describes various mechanical devices used, including the wheeled odometer for measuring distance and the south pointing chariot for indicating cardinal direction. Two engineers in particular, the Palace Officer Xie Fei and Director of Imperial Workshops Wei Mengbian, were known for their designs and worked at the court of Shi Hu (r. 334–349). The two had crafted a four-wheeled carriage about 6 m (20 ft) long with water-spouting dragons hanging over a large golden Buddhist statue that had a mechanical wooden statue of a Daoist continually rubbing his front. Other mechanical figures included ten Daoists dressed in monastic robes who continually rotated around the Buddha while periodically bowing, saluting, and throwing incense into a censer. All of these mechanical figures were driven only by the movement of the carriage; once the carriage halted, the figures stopped moving and the water stopped spouting from the artificial dragons.
Xie and Wei created a similar device operated by wheel motion called the field mill, although it served a more practical purpose than the theatrical display of moving statues and water-spouting dragons. The "Yezhongji" states that the two devised a "pounding cart" or "pounding wagon" which had figurine statues armed with real tilt hammers who pounded and hulled rice only when the cart moved. In addition to this they had a "mill cart" (field mill or camp mill) which had rotating millstones mounted on their frames, which would rotate and grind wheat as the cart moved forward. Just like the carriage with mechanical figures mentioned above, when the carriage stopped, the devices associated with them halted.
Europe.
Use of the field mill in China seems to have died out in use after the Later Zhao, since it was no longer mentioned in Chinese texts until European influence. 
The Italian military engineer Pompeo Targone, who was most notably involved in the Siege of La Rochelle (1627-1628) in western France, invented the field mill in Europe by 1580. As shown in the Italian Vittorio Zonca's engineering treatise of 1607, two mills mounted to a wagon are rotated by a horse whim and gearing while in a stationary position at military camp or near billets. 
This European design found its way into China by the early 17th century, during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). In the "Yuanxi Qiqi Tushuo Luzui" ('Collected Diagrams and Explanations of the Wonderful Machines of the Far West') compiled and translated in 1627 by German Jesuit Johann Schreck (1576–1630) and Ming Dynasty Chinese author Wang Zheng (王徵 1571–1644), a field mill is shown amongst other devices. In this picture, two mills are operated by the gearing of a rotating bar and a whippletree harnessed to a single horse, unlike the two horses seen in Zonca's illustration.

Total fatty matter

Total Fatty Matter (Tfm) is one of the most important characteristics describing the quality of soap and it is always specified in commercial transactions. It is defined as the total amount of fatty matter, mostly fatty acids, that can be separated from a sample after splitting with mineral acid, usually hydrochloric acid. The fatty acids most commonly present in soap are oleic, stearic and palmitic acids and pure, dry, sodium oleate has TFM 92.8%, while top quality soap noodles now increasingly used for making soap tablets in small and medium size factories, are typically traded with a specification TFM 78% min., moisture 14% max. But besides moisture, finished commercial soap, especially laundry soap, also contains fillers used to lower its cost or confer special properties, plus emollients, preservatives, etc. and then the TFM can be as low as 50%. Fillers, which are usually dry powders, also make the soap harder, harsher on the skin and with greater tendency to become 'mushy' in water and so low TFM is usually associated with hardness and lower quality. In older days in Europe and in some countries now, soap with TFM 75% minimum was referred to as Grade 1 and 65% minimum as Grade 2 and less 60% grade 3

Hygrocybe miniata

Hygrocybe miniata, commonly known as the vermilion waxcap, is a small, bright red, or red-orange mushroom of the waxcap genus "Hygrocybe". It is a cosmopolitan species, that is found worldwide. In Europe, it is found in fields, on sandy heaths, or grassy commons in the autumn (fall). It is found in rainforest and eucalypt forest as well as heathland in Australia.
Taxonomy.
"Hygrocybe miniata" was first described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries as "Agaricus miniatus" in 1821, before being renamed by the same author in 1838 as "Hygrophorus miniatus". German mycologist Paul Kummer then assigned it to the genus "Hygrocybe" in 1871. The specific epithet "miniata" comes from ‘miniat’, which means "painted with red lead".
Description.
The cap is convex initially, but later flattens and becomes depressed with a wavy edges. The centre of mature fruiting bodies is noticeably scurfy, or scaly. This is a feature that is best seen on dry specimens, that have not been rained on. The cap colour is scarlet-orange with a yellow striate margin, and is 0.5–3.5 cm in diameter. The bare stem is often long, (up to 3 times the cap diameter) and tapering towards the base, with a tendency to flatten. It is the same colour as the cap, or slightly paler, with a white base. The gills are orange, adnate (with a broad attachment to the stem) or slightly decurrent; widely spaced, and somewhat notched. The flesh is orange, and is devoid of any odour. The spore print is white, and the ellipsoid spores measure 7–9 x 4–5 μm.
A very similar species (only recently described) "H. helobi" (Arnolds) Bon; appears earlier in the season, prefers less acidic soils, and smells of garlic.
Distribution and habitat.
"Hygrocybe miniata" is a cosmopolitan species, having been recorded in most of the temperate zones. It has been collected from Britain, Europe, America, and the equivalent zones in the Southern Hemisphere such as eastern and southern Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.
In Britain it appears in autumn (fall), particularly in frost free periods, and prefers sandy heaths, grassy clearings, or unimproved fields. It is often seen in the company of mouse-ear hawkweed ("Hieracium pilosella").
In Australia, it can be found in temperate to subtropical rainforest and eucalypt forest as well as heathland. Fruiting bodies may appear in groups among the leaf litter from January to June.
Edibility.
Edible, but of no consequence.

Maison de la France

ATOUT FRANCE - the France Tourism Development Agency - (formerly Maison de la France - The French National Tourist Office) is the organisation responsible for promoting France as a tourism destination.
Mission.
Set up in 1987 and operating under the supervision of the Minister of State responsible for Trade, Artisan Trades, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, Tourism and Services, the mission of Maison de la France was to promote France as a tourist destination, principally in other countries.
As of May 1, 2009 ODIT France and Maison de la France have merged and become a single structure: "Atout France". It fully integrates the tasks of the original structures.
Offices.
ATOUT FRANCE has operations on all 5 continents, with 35 offices in 29 countries. The offices of ATOUT FRANCE employ 200 people and are responsible for promoting France as a tourist destination in the various markets, grouped into major geographical areas of operation, on the basis of annual action plans. They are involved in all areas of tourism promotion (information to the public, press relations, commercial promotion, etc.).
Priority markets.
ATOUT FRANCE gives priority to investing in the major outbound tourism markets, which are the countries of the European Union, North America and Japan.
Pioneering role.
The economic interest group (EIG) is also involved in the emerging markets where there is strong growth in tourism such as Russia, Brazil, China, South Korea, India and Mexico. Its responsibility is to play a pioneering role in these markets and to encourage investments.
The International Advisory Board.
The International Advisory Board was set up by Maison de la France at the beginning of 2003, with the collaboration of Air France and under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Tourism. This authority brings together 250 tourism professionals from all over the world recognised for their contribution to the development of France as a destination. The board members both play an advisory role with Maison de la France and act as ambassadors of the tourist image of France in their particular market, along with the offices of the EIG.
Campaign strategy.
The campaign strategy is bringing in new measures, such as the creation of the "Qualité France" logo or affinity marketing, and is setting up tools for evaluating markets and campaigns.
French know-how.
The quality of French know-how is emphasised by the creation and promotion of the “Qualité France” logo, implemented by the Ministry of Tourism in the French markets and abroad, as well as by the creation of a strong and original slogan for French tourism. Partnerships will be strengthened by the setting up of a new policy based on contracts running over several years with the leading institutional and private organisations.
Long-haul markets.
The Europe approach to long-haul markets takes the form of joint promotional campaigns within the European Commission on Tourism and/or through bilateral agreements with national tourist boards.

Programmable load

A programmable load is a type of test equipment or instrument which emulates DC or AC resistance loads normally required to perform functional tests of batteries, power supplies or solar cells. By virtue of being programmable, tests like load regulation, battery discharge curve measurement and transient tests can be fully automated and load changes for these tests can be made without introducing switching transient that might change the measurement or operation of the power source under test.
Implementation.
A programmable load is simply a programmable power supply that applies a voltage but sinks current rather than sourcing it. By changing the current direction, the programmable load electrically "looks like" a programmable resistor rather than a programmable (Thévenin) voltage source.
Advanced DC Programmable loads offer additional test capabilities with internal controls that can detect oscillations within a fraction of a second and immediately stabilize the load profile. By eliminating the effects of oscillation and current spikes a programmable load can protect against damage to your mission critical electronics.
Electronic load testing systems for defense, aerospace, commercial electronics and utilities industries, as well as for mega data center performance often require special modes of operation such as constant voltage, constant current, constant resistance and constant power. For some demanding applications, these electronic load banks may offer fast slew rates and pulsed load profiles such as sine, square, triangle and ramp as well as internal capacitance, inductance, and time delay modes of operation. Today's most advanced programmable loads typically offer 16bit measurement and drive accuracy for superior performance.

Geum japonicum

Geum japonicum is a yellow-flowering perennial plant native to North America and East Asia, especially Japan. It may be synonymous with "Geum macrophyllum", the North American flower. As a traditional herbal remedy it is known as an astringent and used in poultices. However, in recent years, the "Thunberg" variant has received attention for other possible medical uses.
With regard to muscular recovery, an extract has been found to help muscles recover following "severe injury", to reduce myocardial infarct size by 35-45% when administered following a heart attack, and to inhibit apoptosis. It also has possible anti-viral properties, including action against HIV and HSV. Action against tumors has also been noted.

Technical translation

Technical translation is a type of specialized translation involving the translation of documents produced by technical writers (owner's manuals, user guides, etc.), or more specifically, texts which relate to technological subject areas or texts which deal with the practical application of scientific and technological information. While the presence of specialized terminology is a feature of technical texts, specialized terminology alone is not sufficient for classifying a text as "technical" since numerous disciplines and subjects which are not "technical" possess what can be regarded as specialized terminology. Technical translation covers the translation of many kinds of specialized texts and requires a high level of subject knowledge and mastery of the relevant terminology and writing conventions.
The importance of consistent terminology in technical translation, for example in patents, as well as the highly formulaic and repetitive nature of technical writing makes computer-assisted translation using translation memories and terminology databases especially appropriate. In his book "Technical Translation" Jody Byrne argues that technical translation is closely related to technical communication and that it can benefit from research in this and other areas such as usability and cognitive psychology.
In addition to making texts with technical jargon accessible for a wider ranging audience, technical translation also involves linguistic features of translating technological texts from one language to another.
Translation as a whole is a balance of art and science influenced by both theory and practice. Having knowledge of both the linguistic features as well as the aesthetic features of translation applies directly to the field of technical translation.
Background.
As a field, technical translation has been recognized, studied, and developed since the 1960s. Stemming from the field of translation studies, the field of technical translation traditionally emphasized much importance on the source language from which text is translated. However, over the years there has been a movement away from this traditional approach to a focus on the purpose of the translation and on the intended audience. This is perhaps because only 5-10% of items in a technical document are terminology, while the other 90-95% of the text is language, most likely in a natural style of the source language. 
Though technical translation is only one subset of the different types of professional translation, it is the largest subset as far as output is concerned. Currently, more than 90% of all professionally translated work is done by technical translators, highlighting the importance and significance of the field.
Methods and practices.
Technical translator.
The role of the technical translator is to not only be a transmitter of information, but also to be a constructor of procedural discourse and knowledge through meaning, particularly because often, the technical translator may also take on the role of the technical writer. Research has demonstrated that technical communicators do, in fact, create new meaning as opposed to simply repackaging (198) old information. This emphasizes the important role that technical translators play in making meaning, whether they are doing technical translation in one language or in multiple languages.
Much like professionals in the field of technical communication, the technical translator must have a cross-curricular and multifaceted background. In addition to grasping theoretical and linguistic orientations for the actual translation process, an understanding of other subjects, such as cognitive psychology, usability engineering, and technical communication, is necessary for a successful technical translator. Additionally, most technical translators work within a specialized field such as medical or legal technical translation, which highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary background. 
Finally, the technical translators should also become familiar with the field of professional translation through training.
Technical translation requires a solid knowledge base of technological skills, particularly if the translator chooses to utilize computer-assisted translation (CAT) or machine translation (MT). Though some technical translators complete all translation without the use of CAT or MT, this is often with pieces that require more creativity in the document. Documents dealing with mechanics or engineering that contain frequently translated phrases and concepts are often translated using CAT or MT.
Machine translation.
Overview.
Practitioners within the field of technical translation often employ what is called machine translation (MT), or machine-assisted translation. This method of translation uses various types of computer software to generate translations from a source language to a target language without the assistance of a human. There are different methods of machine translation. A plethora of machine translators in the form of free search engines are available online. However, within the field of technical communication, there are two basic types of machine translators, which are able to translate massive amounts of text as a time. There are transfer-based and data-driven machine translators. Transfer-based machine translation systems, which are quite costly to develop, are built by linguists who determine the grammar rules for the source and target languages. The machine works within the rules and guidelines developed by the linguist. Due to the nature of developing rules for the system, this can be very time-consuming and requires an extensive knowledge base about the structures of the languages on the part of the linguist; nonetheless, the majority of commercial machine translators are transfer-based machines. Yahoo! BabelFish is a common example of a platform that uses this type of translation technology.
Data-driven machine translators, also known as statistical-based machine translators, work by aggregating massive amounts of previously translated bits of information, and uses statistical analysis to determine matches between the source language and target language with the previously aggregated corpora. This method is less expensive and requires less development time than transfer-based machine translation, but the generated translation is often not to the same quality as transfer-based translation. The translation services offered through Google use transfer-based translation technology.
Effectiveness.
For technical translators without access to expensive machinery, the Internet hosts many online translation sites that are either free or require a small fee. Some research has been done in order to test the effectiveness of various online translation tools. In one article, researchers looked at the success of online machine translators in retrieving appropriate search results. Looking at Google translator, Babelfish (previous to the merge of Babelfish and Yahoo!), Yahoo!, and Prompt, test searches were based on translating key search words and comparing the search results with a monolingual search. Using computer-based statistical analysis, the results showed that translated search results were only 10% less effective than a monolingual search, making the translated search fairly successful in retrieving appropriate information. However, the success in this particular study was only possible when English was one of the target languages.
Other research points to the effectiveness of machine translation when paired with human interaction. In a mixed methods experiment, researchers first examined the effectiveness of machine translations using statistical analysis and then used subjects to test out a new type of machine translation (TransType2) that required human interaction as a part of the translation process. The results of the experiment showed that human interaction is a vital supplement for overall accuracy in machine translations. This research demonstrates the importance of the role that technical translators can play in the process of translating technical documents.
Advantages.
While no machine translation device is able to replicate or replace the dynamics of a human translator, machine translation certainly poses important advantages. In fact, there are many practical uses for and implications of machine translation for the field of technical translation. 
Machine translation has major cost advantages as compared to human translation. In fields of technical communication where information is constantly changing, for example, the stock market or jobs related to the weather, the cost of paying a human translator to constantly update information would become quite expensive. Additionally, situations that involve translating massive volumes of information over a short period of time, or situations that require speedy and frequent communication would benefit from machine translation. In such circumstances, a machine translator would be advantageous from a financial perspective.
Technical translation and culture.
Translating culture.
Just as important as proper translation of linguistic qualities of languages is the subject of culture and how specific cultural features are transferred and communicated in the field of technical translation. In fact, a mutual understanding of cultural components is just as important as linguistic knowledge in technical translation. This highlights the complicated nature of working with technical translation. Various cultures can exhibit drastic differences in how communication occurs, even when both cultures are working with the same target language. One Canadian technical translator and consultant working with Russian colleagues detailed difficulties while working with both North American English and global English. Encountering discrepancies in rhetorical writing strategies, differentiation in tones, document formatting issues, and conflicting conceptual goals for engineering reports, the author emphasizes cultural practices, outside of the direct realm of linguistic forms, that can impede proper communication in technical translation.
In an example using a commonly translated document, the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a researcher used correlation analyses, including semantic network analysis and spatial modeling, to interpret data describing differences among seven different translated versions of the document. Demonstrating how culture plays an important role in the process of technical translation, the results of the study showed that while the translations were fairly similar, cultural subtleties and differences existed in each language's translated version. For example, across the seven languages, common words such as "people", "individual", "man", "nation", "law", "faith", and "family' had differing levels of importance in relation to other words in the language. While in Arabic the word "man" exhibited high levels of importance in the text, other languages placed higher levels of importance with words such as "person" or "individual". In another example, the English word for "entitle" and the Chinese word for "enjoy" carried connotations attached to the concept of "rights", demonstrating a linkage of concepts unique to each individual language. Theses slight differences demonstrate the culturally specific nuances that exist across languages. 
As with any type of non-MT, it is still a process completed by human beings, making it impossible for total objectivity. International technical communication cannot ignore cultural differences, so seeing how the differences affect translation is fundamental for professionals in the field.
Additionally, one's cultural knowledge base, or lack thereof, can be detrimental to the effectiveness of communication, particularly when communicating warnings or risk factors. Considering how differing knowledge paradigms as a result of cultural factors can prompt people to respond in a variety of ways to different rhetorical strategies, particularly when communicating messages containing warnings of hazards or risks, understanding culture must be a priority in technical translation. One researcher found that a variance of definition of terms and inconsistent paradigms of cultural knowledge highlight the need for a new delineation of what technical writers consider as the target audience while communicating risk factors. What might be appropriate for one audience must be reconsidered for a culturally different audience. Looking at a specific example concerning the hazardous occupation of mining, one piece of research demonstrates how different cultures different perceptions about safety information. Comparing risk communication in mining in the United States and the United Kingdom, the researcher discovered variations among the perceptions of who is responsible for promoting safety in the workplace. While one culture felt that the user or worker was responsible for promoting his or her own safety in the workplace, another culture perceived the science behind the process or document to be responsible for the promotion of safety. As risks, warnings, or cautions are often important components of a technical document in need of translation, the technical translator will understand how such cultural differences can affect the effectiveness of the translated message. Avoiding assumptions about a culture and allowing one's own knowledge base to consider more diverse populations will create more effective cross-cultural communication not only when working with risky environments, but in general communication as well.
Some research has investigated the possibility of a universal writing style in order to help with the translatability of writing across different cultures and languages. However, demonstrating the difficulty of such a task, one researcher addressed the assumption that unambiguous wording eases effective communication. He gave examples from certain Asian contexts when unclear communication was actually helpful because the unequivocal language forced communicators to rely more heavily on oral discourse than on written documents. The example of the effectiveness about ambiguous language not only shows problems with a universal writing style for technical translation, but also reiterates another example of how culture plays an important role in proper technical translation.
Culture and technology.
In an age where technology allows for increased accessibility and faster communication, the technical translator must understand the role that culture plays in how people interact with, react to, and utilize technology and how these culturally related concepts can affect communicated messages.
Demonstrating how technology use differs across cultures, one researcher created a presentation that took a holistic look at preparing documents for ethnically diverse audiences, pointing out other non-linguistic topics that require special attention in communication across cultures. For example, the presenter noted items to be considered including measurement systems, types of graphics and symbols, and types of media presentation tools. The author also pointed out significant differences that would affect communication among English languages including paper layouts, spelling, meaning, and use of humor. This important and practical information can be used by professionals working with technical translation.
Additionally, technical translation involves understanding how the Internet has influenced different cultures across the globe. Varying languages, cultural influences on Internet usage patterns, and media preferences force professionals in the field of technical communication to utilize a number of different strategies in order to effectively reach diverse populations across the globe. With international online populations the technical translator must be culturally diverse in a technological sense.
Finally, as technology makes intercultural and international communication easier, the technical translator must understand intercultural communication as it relates to ethics. Traditional models for ethical decision-making can be applied to difficult situations in technical translation, but the professional must avoid stereotyping and ethnocentrism in technical communication and translation
Technical translation and English as a "lingua franca".
English effect on translation.
Technical translation is the medium through which language, discourse and communication can exist in a global world. As technology creates easier and faster means of communication and the world moves toward becoming a global community, the need to communicate with people from multiple language backgrounds also grows. Rather than working with multiple languages, some have proposed the idea of using English as the primary language for global communication, making English the lingua franca—or a common world language. However, English as a lingua franca has various implications for the field of technical communication. Particularly for technical translators who are native speakers of English, there is the tendency to assume a unilateral stance on translation. In other words, the technical translator's objective is to translate to and from English, with the English message being the main focus. While English is a language of global communication, it is not the only language being used for communication, highlighting the importance of moving away from "singular perspective" of only communicating in English. The concept of maintaining technical communication in languages other than English is of particular significance in countries with high volumes of multilingual speakers. For example, research has shown that the English-speaking bias, due to the language's position as the lingua franca, within technical translation and communication has negatively affected native Spanish speakers in the United States. Lacking both in quality and quantity, user manuals for various electronic devices exemplified sub-par translations into Spanish, demonstrating the limited accessibility of certain technical documents to speakers of languages other than English, perhaps partly as a result of English as the lingua franca. Finally, when discussing English as a lingua franca it is noteworthy to mention what some researchers call "untranslatable" words and what that means for technical translation. Such words or phrases are composed of concepts that are not easily translated from one language to another. A word is considered "untranslatable" when there is either no direct corresponding word in the target language, requiring the word to be described or when important cultural connotations from the source language are not properly communicated through the target word. For example, a common example in English of an untranslatable word is the German word "schadenfreude", which means to exhibit joy as a result of someone else's misfortune. This word exemplifies untranslatability due to the lack of a corresponding word; however words can be untranslatable due to a lack of a corresponding word, loss of cultural meaning, or for both reasons. 
One study demonstrated that when faced with untranslatable words, technical translators resorted to avoidance tactics that evaded using the words altogether. The implications of untranslatable words and phrases suggest that the technical translation may not benefit from only utilizing English as a lingua franca, and rather, should focus efforts toward having more effective means of translating documents among multiple languages.

Maria (Counting Crows)

Maria is a recurring character in the songs written by Adam Duritz, the songwriter and lead singer of Counting Crows. Maria has appeared in the lyrics of four Counting Crows songs and in two other songs written by Duritz, and has fueled speculation and debate among fans. Duritz contends that she is fictional, along with humans in general.
Appearances.
Maria has appeared in six songs written by Duritz: twice in songs written for his first band, The Himalayans, and in four Counting Crows songs. All in all, Maria has been mentioned by name nine times in Duritz's discography, appearing in three singles that made US charts, and two that cracked top ten lists.
Duritz's explanation.
The most commonly accepted explanation of Maria is provided by Duritz in a single quote, often cited.
This explanation seems to be accepted by most fans, including Lisa LeBarre, Counting Crows employee and creator of Counting Crows' biggest fan-site.
Alternative theories.
Still some fans contend that Duritz’s explanation of Maria is unsatisfactory. The fact that Duritz writes almost exclusively about real people and events has led some to believe that Maria is, or was, a real person.
An extensive investigation into the possible identity of a real-life 'Maria' by "801 Magazine" journalist Steven Elwell, one in which he interviewed several friends of Duritz including the real-life "Mr. Jones" himself, concluded without a definitive answer. Elwell writes that in the end, the myth of Maria may be "lovelier than the awful truth," and that perhaps "it is better to leave such things alone."
In the linear notes of Counting Crow's first album there is a thank you to Maria Mancuso Gersh. It has been said that Adam had stayed with Maria and her husband (president of Capitol Records at the time) Gary Gersh during this transitional time in Los Angeles.

Wahroonga Public School

Wahroonga Public School is a public school located in Wahroonga, New South Wales and is known as "The Bush School". The school is one of the only schools with two swimming pools in New South Wales.
History.
The school opened in 1944 when parental groups brought the need for a school in the area to the attention of council members and other community groups. When the school first opened, it had 11 students, and one teacher/principal. The school celebrated its 60th birthday in 2004. The school continues to grow. In 2007, the school was one of the few schools in the state to increase enrolments.
Over the years, Wahroonga Public School gained many more pupils, increasing to over 700 students in the mid-1990s. The number has fallen to just above 700 students in recent times.
Jenny Ryan was appointed as principal in 1997 and eventually left the school in 2003, continuing her career at another school. During her time as principal, she was awarded the "State Government Community Service Award". Graham Hill was principal from 2004 to mid-2010, succeeded by Mr John Benton. The vice-principal is Leonie Hibbert and searching for new vice principal, and the substitute vice-principal, in case of absence of both principals mentioned above, is Jennifer Flynn. Hill made the news in 2004 when he "auctioned" his parking space at the school to raise much needed money for blinds, vents and roof insulation for the kindergarten classrooms at the school.
In 2006, the school's new sports grounds was opened by the Australian Defence minister Brendan Nelson. In the same year, the school community raised over $8000 towards a life saving operation for a kindergarten pupil who attends the school. The toddler also appeared on the "Today" television show to raise more money for the operation.
Extracurricular opportunities.
The school is well known for its music program, run by Anne Seage (2000–Present). It has five bands: Beginner Band, Junior Band, Intermediate Band, Concert Band and Stage Band (Jazz Band) and junior jazz band. Each year the bands win prizes at various competitions, such as the Yamaha Music Festival held annually at Willoughby Town Hall, Chatswood, New South Wales.
In 2002 the school was selected by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for an e-Learning Project. As part of the project, computer equipment was purchased for the installation of an intranet to facilitate learning. The bush school also offers lots of sporting choices and over the year there are several different gala days.

Henry Redford

Sir Henry Redford or Retford (ca. 1354 – ca. 1409) was a Knight of the Shire, Sheriff of Lincolnshire and the Speaker of the House of Commons. 
In 1384 he served on a number of royal commissions and was knighted.
After serving with Richard II on an ill-fated Scottish campaign in 1385 he accompanied John of Gaunt in 1386 on his expedition to Spain. In 1389, 1392 and 1397 he served as High Sheriff of Lincolnshire and represented Lincolnshire in parliament as Knight of the Shire for 1400, and in 1401 was summoned to the privy council.
In 1402 he again represented Lincolnshire in the parliament that met on 1 Oct 1402 and two days later he was elected speaker. The parliament was held at Coventry before moving to Westminster (due to problems with lodgings and food), with the Lord Chancellor asking for:
Ways and means for maintaining the war against Scotland, for utterly subjecting the enemies of Wales, for wholly conquering Ireland and for defending Guienne, Calais and the Marches thereof.
Alarmed at the scale of the request, Parliament took several days to consider it, but found they couldn't come to any conclusion. On 10 October they asked permission to confer with members of the House of Lords, which the King granted under duress. As a result 4 Bishops, 4 Earls and 4 Barons were ordered to attend, and the end decision was a three-shilling tax on wine and a 15 pence tax on merchandise to sponsor the King's efforts. It is reported that Henry was so pleased with the result that he invited both houses to dine with him privately.
In 1403 Redford was again attending meetings of the privy council, and in 1404 once more represented Lincolnshire in parliament and served as sheriff of the county for the fourth and last time in 1406.
He died around 1409. He had married by Easter 1385, Katherine, widow of Sir Ralph Paynell of Caythorpe and Carlton Paynell; they had one son, Henry, who succeeded him and was later attained for treason as a Yorkist.

Azoulay

Azoulay (), sometimes spelled Azoulai, Azulay, Azulai, Zouela, etc. is a Sephardic Jewish Surname, common among Jews of North African extraction.
The source of the name is debated. The name has a Berber form, and has been explained as referring to the Tazoulait region near Errachidia, thus meaning 'from Tazoulait'. It has also been linked to the Berber word 'izli', meaning 'good'. Some have linked it to the Spanish phrase Azul Ojos (blue eyes). Some linguists argue that it is an acronym of a passage from the bible "They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane" (Leviticus 21:7), indicating that the Azoulay name-bearers are members of the Cohen tribe.

German amateur football championship

The German amateur football championship was a national football competition in Germany organized by the German Football Association (German: Deutscher Fußball-Bund; DFB) and in existence from 1950 to 1998.
History.
Overview.
The championship was established in 1950 as a counterpart to the German football championship, which was open only to the winners of the tier-one "Oberligas".
To qualify for the German amateur championship, a club had to play in the highest amateur league of its regional football federation. The majority of these leagues were tier-three leagues. Only in Niedersachsen, Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Berlin were these leagues set at the second level. From 1963, with the introduction of the Fußball-Bundesliga, all these leagues became tier-three leagues too.
To qualify for the amateur championship, a club either had to win its highest local amateur league and then not to have to take part in any post-season promotion-round. A club could also decline to take part in the promotion round and play in the amateur championship instead. Also, league winners who were reserve teams of professional clubs were ineligible for promotion to the professional level and had to play in the amateur championship instead. Mostly however, the clubs playing in the championship were the runners-up of their leagues.
1950 to 1955.
In the first five editions of the competition, the modus remained unchanged from season to season. Fifteen clubs competed in a knock-out system, whereby one club had a bye for the first round. Clubs paired against each other would only play one game to determined the winner of the tie. The competition only included teams from West Germany and West Berlin, East German clubs did not take part. Also, clubs from the Saarland did not take part either at this stage. The fifteen clubs came from the following leagues (tier):
From 1952, the knock-out system in the first round was replaced by a group stage, where in three groups of four and one group of three teams, a group winner was determined. This four winners then went on to the semi-finals.
1955 to 1964.
The modus was altered in 1955, when, from then on, the five regions each determined their own champion. The five regional winners then qualified for the German amateur championship. The competition still operated on a knock-out system, but now only four games, ignoring possible replays, were played:
This system remained in place until the end of the 1963–64 season.
1964 to 1978.
From the 1964–65 season, the sixteen regional champions, now with the Saarland, were again qualified for the competition. In a knock-out system, now with home-and-away games, the winner was determined. Only the final was played as an on-off match on neutral ground. Only in 1976–77 and 1977–78 was the final also played as a home-and-away contest. Otherwise, the modus remained unchanged until 1978, when the "Amateur Oberligas" were formed.
1979 to 1991.
A league reform in 1978 reduced the number of tier-three leagues from sixteen to eight. Also, the leagues were renamed to "Amateur Oberliga". The winner of each of those leagues qualified for the amateur championship, which was played as the years before, in a knock-out format with home-and-away games, including the final in the first season, 1978–79. From 1979 to 1980, the final was again played as a single game, but now as a home game for one of the two teams involved, to improve attendance figures.
The eight teams came from the following leagues:
After the 1980–81 season, the winners of the eight leagues had to compete for 2nd Bundesliga promotion. The amateur championship was therefore played out by the league runners-up from then on. This system in turn remained in place until the German reunion in 1991.
1991 to 1994.
The effects of the German reunion changed the map of German football considerably and in regards of the German amateur championship, the number of teams qualified increased. East Germany and West-Berlin were sub-divided in three new "Oberligas" while the "Oberliga Berlin" was disbanded. The three new leagues were:
This meant, ten clubs, still the runners-up of their league, were now qualified for the competition. It was staged in two regional groups, north and south, with five teams each. Each team would play the other four in their group once and the two group winners would then stage the final. The 1991–92 competition marked a unique event, the Rot-Weiß Essen became the first and to-date only club to have taken out the German championship (1955) and the German amateur championship (1992) with its first team. Having won the German Cup in 1953, the club holds a unique triple of titles in German football.
This system only operated for three seasons, 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1993–94. It was replaced when the "Regionalligas" were established as the new tier-three leagues in Germany in 1994. From then on, the "Oberligas" were not the highest amateur leagues in the country any more.
1994 to 1998.
Four "Regionalligas" were established in 1994 and the teams competing in the German amateur championship now came from these leagues:
In each of the three next seasons, four teams qualified for the competition in a varying set-up:
The variation in teams qualified from each league resulted in a different number of teams from each league being promoted to the "2nd Bundesliga".
In its last season, the championship was played with only three teams, the runners-up from "West/Südwest" and "Süd" and the winner of "Nordost". Each played each other once only and the group winner "Tennis Borussia Berlin" was named German amateur champion. Additionally, the club was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. This last edition, played without a final for the first time, was much more a promotion round with the amateur title being only a footnote.
Disbanding and current status.
A lack of interest in the competition lead to its being disbanded. It suffered from being regarded as a competition for failed clubs that had missed out on more meaningful regional or national honours, or that had missed promotion to a higher level of play. Attempts to make the competition more attractive by allowing the top teams of the competition into the German Cup tournament had little effect.
In May 2006, the chairman of the DFB (German Football Association), Theo Zwanziger, voiced his interest in re-establishing a national amateur championship from 2008 onwards, after the 3rd Liga was to be formed. He left open as to whether the competition should be for the winners of Regionalliga (IV) or Oberliga (V) play.
Media.
The SC Jülich, the only club to win the title three times in a row, was the feature of a documentary by a German sports network, the "Deutsches Sportfernsehen — DSF", about Germany's most successful amateur club. The club had fallen on hard times and almost folded in the 1990s, dropping to the lowest tier of the local league system before recovering.
List of winners.
In its almost fifty year history, the competition had thirty-eight different winners.
Finals 1950 to 1997.

First edition 1950–51: clubs.
Fifteen teams took part in the competitions first edition, taking place in June 1951, qualified from the following leagues:
Notes.
Note on the term amateur.
The term "amateur" in German football nowadays does not quite mean the same as in other countries; it does not as such indicate that a player does not get paid but rather means the player is paid below a certain level, often a so-called "Aufwandsentschädigung", which literally means "reimbursement of costs". Rather, in comparison with the league system in the United Kingdom, the term amateur could be translated with non-league.
Up until the formation of the "Regionalligas", reserve teams of professional clubs carried the title "Amateure" behind the club name to distinguish first from second team. Because these teams are not truly amateurs, these teams now, like all other reserve sides, carry the II behind the name, for example, VfB Stuttgart Amateure became VfB Stuttgart II.
Attendance figures.
The high number of spectators in the 1951, 1952, 1957 and 1961 finals results from the fact that the games were held as curtain raisers for the German championship finals.

Aeolian landform

Aeolian landforms are features of the Earth's surface produced by either the erosive or constructive action of the wind. This process is not unique to earth, and it has been observed and studied on other planets, including Mars.
Terminology.
The word derives from Æolus, the Greek god of the winds, and the son of Hellen and the nymph Orseis, and a brother of Dorus, Xuthus and Amphictyon.
Mechanism.
In aeolian processes, wind transports and deposits particles of sediment. Aeolian features form in areas where wind is the primary source of erosion. The particles deposited are of sand, silt and clay size. The particles are entrained in by one of four processes. Creep occurs when a particle rolls or slides across the surface. Lift occurs when a particle rises off the surface due to the Bernoulli effect. If the airflow is turbulent, larger particles are transported by a process known as saltation. Finally, impact transport occurs which one particle strikes another causing the second particle to move.
Erosional landforms.
Wind eroded landforms are rarely preserved on the surface of the Earth except in arid regions. Elsewhere, moving water erases the aeolian landforms. There are several types of landforms associated with erosion: lag deposits, ventifacts, yardangs and pans. Large basins are complex and there is often one or more non-aeolian process at work, including tectonics, glacial and alluvial forces.

Myriad Group

Myriad Group is a French/Swiss software company in the mobile phone sector. It was established in 2009 by the merge of the companies Purple Labs and Esmertec. The two companies had mostly common owners, and the deal was executed so that Esmertec, a publicly listed company, acquired Purple Labs in exchange of shares of the company. The merged company has around 500 employees.
The original Purple Labs was French, headquartered in Chambéry, and developed and marketed Linux-based software to mobile OEMs and ODMs. With its 2008 purchase of Openwave's mobile software suite, it owns the Openwave mobile browser, one of the most widely used mobile internet browsers. Over its history, the browser has been shipped in over 2.24 billion devices, as of the end of 2010.
Esmertec was a provider of Java in-device engines and mobile services platforms, headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.
As part of the new company structure, Myriad now also offers products and services for Mobile Operators, including:
History of Purple Labs.
The company was founded in 2001 by Jean-Luc Botto, Dennis O'Donovan, Sebastien Soyer and Jean-Marie Andre. Simon Wilkinson was appointed as chief executive officer in October 2007, shortly after the firm raised $14.5 million in venture capital funding. On June 30, 2008, Purple Labs acquired Openwave's mobile phone client software division, which develops browser and messaging client technologies, for $32 million. On July 31, 2008 the company agreed to acquire Sagem Communication's mobile phone software and associated engineering teams. On 16 April 2012 the company expanded further with the acquisition of Synchronica plc. However, the £23.9 million deal lead to serious financial situation of Myriad. As a consequence, Simon Wilkinson resigned with immediate effect on 26 September 2012. Mike Grant was appointed as co-CEO until a new full-time CEO had been found. Stephen Dunford was appointed as Myriad's new Chief Executive Officer on 4 December 2012.

Jeroen Sluijter

Jeroen Sluijter (born April 2, 1975 in Zwijndrecht) is a Dutch baseball player who currently plays for Neptunus and the Dutch national team.
Sluijter debuted in the Hoofdklasse in 1993 with the Twins Sport Club. In 1996, he moved to SV ADO and then Neptunus in 1997. With Neptunus, he became Hoofdklasse champion each year from 1998–2005, one of the greatest dynasties in Netherlands baseball history. He went 2 for 5 in the 1997 World Port Tournament, his lone Dutch national team appearance of the 20th Century.
Sluijter returned to the national team in 2002, appearing in the Haarlem Baseball Week. He went 1 for 4 as a backup infielder; in the Gold Medal game, he was a late substitute for Evert-Jan 't Hoen and did not bat in a 5-4 loss to the United States. In the 2002 Intercontinental Cup, he was 1 for 3, backing up former AAA player 't Hoen at second and former major leaguer Ralph Milliard at shortstop. Sluijter played for the Dutch in three events in 2003. In the 2003 World Port Tournament, he was a starter and hit .292/.452/.292 and led the event with 7 walks. He led the Netherlands with 2 hits (in 3 tries) in a 3-2 loss to Cuba in the Gold Medal game, though he did make one error at third base. He was 0 for 2 with 2 walks and a run in the 2003 European Championship and did not play in the Gold Medal game, which the Netherlands won. In the 2003 Baseball World Cup, he only played one inning in the field as the backup 2B to 't Hoen and went 0 for 1 at the plate.
In the 2004 Hoofdklasse season, Sluijter tied for 6th with 9 doubles. He was 0 for 3 in the 2004 Haarlem Baseball Week and did not play in the Gold Medal game, which the Orange won against Cuba. It was his last time on the national team for four years. In 2005, Sluijter tied for 8th in the Hoofdklasse with 26 runs, albeit only tied for 5th on Neptunus. He hit only .213/.323/.272 that year and fielded .940 at the hot corner. The next year, he had his best season yet, batting .324/.380/.394. He tied Sidney de Jong and Reily Legito for 7th in the loop with 10 doubles and was 12th in average. His .947 fielding percentage led the Hoofdklasse third baseman. 2007 was a down year as he hit .220/.348/.295 and fielded .899 at third.
In the 2008 European Cup in Regensburg, Sluijter hit .444/.500/.833 with 7 runs and 7 RBI in 5 games. Against the Templiers de Sénart, he was 3 for 3 with 2 homers and a walk to lead the Neptunus charge. He was 8th in the Cup in average, tied Legito and Giuseppe Mazzanti for second in RBI (one behind Eugene Kingsale) and tied four others (including Luis Ugueto and Pavel Budsky) for the home run lead (2). He tied for 4th in runs, two behind leader Simon Kudernatsch. He went 1 for 2 with a walk and a run in the 2008 Haarlem Baseball Week, his first appearance with the national team in four years. Thanks in part to an injury to Hainley Statia, Sluijter remained with the Orange for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Smeets batted .421/.476/.526 to help Kinheim win the 2008 European Cup in Grosseto. His 7 RBI tied for the lead. He had the big hit of the competition; down 2-1 in the bottom of the 10th of the Gold medal games, Smeets doubled in René Cremer and Dirk van 't Klooster with a shot off of Linc Mikkelsen; Smeets had fouled off five pitches in a row before the double.
Smeets was selected by coach Robert Eenhoorn in the team that represents the Netherlands at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

The initial concept designs for "Last Exile" were created by character designer Range Murata. Murata also spent a great amount of time on costume design. Wanting to portray each character's personality more fully, he "tried to draw in the kind of material that would have been used in creating their clothes and try to represent the stitches connecting the fabric". Although Gonzo initially intended for "Last Exile" to be shown in a space setting, it did not want characters who use sterile space suits. As a result, Murata's designs placed the show in its current setting.
Although the fictional world of Prester is not a representation of Earth, it features technology reminiscent of nineteenth century Europe at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Many of its designs were also inspired by Germany's technological advances during the interwar period. Uniform designs for Anatoray's musketeers were based on Napoleon Bonaparte's army and American Civil War soldiers. On the other hand, Soviet Red Army fur coats provided the basis for Disith uniforms. The crew of the "Silvana" wore uniforms that were more modern and utilitarian.
Production of "Last Exile" relied heavily on 3D computer animation. The animation for "Last Exile" was also supplemented with Victorian era flourishes. In order to combine hand-drawn animation with computer-generated ones, the production team used a technique for non-photorealistic rendering, which could not be used for "Blue Submarine No. 6" (a previous work of Gonzo and one of the first CG anime series) because of a stylistic conflict. At the 2003 Anime Expo, production designer Mahiro Maeda, who also worked with Studio Ghibli's production of "Laputa: Castle in the Sky", commented that "["Last Exile"] is very advanced in how it will incorporate the two mediums".
Last Exile.
Protagonists.
The story of "Last Exile" revolves Claus Valca and Lavie Head, who fly their vanship as sky couriers. Although they usually take up missions of relatively low difficulty, they are one day asked to complete the mission of dying courier Ralf Wednesday. The mission, rated seven stars out of ten, is to deliver a young girl named Alvis E. Hamilton to the mysterious battleship "Silvana". Despite their fears, Claus and Lavie deliver Alvis to the battleship but decide to remain aboard to keep her safe. It is later revealed that Alvis holds the key to uniting the two warring nations of Anatoray and Disith.
Claus Valca.
Claus is no stranger to the vanship courier lifestyle, having been born into and raised for the lifestyle by his late father Hamilcar Valca (much like navigator Georges Head raised daughter Lavie). Their fathers died while attempting to cross the "Grand Stream" on a mission that would have brought peace to Prester. After this and his mother's death, Claus followed in his father's footsteps throughout his childhood and early adolescence to becomes a top-notch pilot.
While transporting their special "cargo", Alvis Hamilton, Claus and Lavie's vanship is damaged and they are forced to stay onbord the "Silvana". The captain of the ship, Alex Row, had been the young pilot who delivered news of his father's death to his family. On top of that, he caught the eye of Dio Eraclea, who was fascinated with his skills as a vanship pilot. Though uncomfortable in his presence, Claus treats Dio as a friend.
Lavie Head.
Unlike Claus, she is relatively reluctant to stay on the "Silvana" and favors the freedom of the vanship lifestyle. She abhors the use of vanships for military purposes, and deplores Claus's interest in becoming a combat pilot. Along with her friendly nature, she can hold grudges with others. Her feelings for Claus are obviously conflicted. She treats Claus mostly like a dear friend and sibling, sometimes acts the part of nagging but caring wife, insofar as she cooks for him and rustles him out of bed. She seems to have repressed romantic feelings for Claus, judging by the somewhat simmering jealously she feels when Tatiana Wisla starts showing an interest in Claus. This most prominently appears when Claus and Tatiana return to the Silvana with Tatiana wearing Claus's pilot suit.
As the events of the series unfold, the emphasis of the story began to shift away from her and Claus, instead focusing on the plights of the two countries in Prester, and the treachery of the Guild. However, she and Claus bore witness to Alvis's release of "Exile", and in the end, chose to settle in the new world.
Alvis E. Hamilton.
When Al woke up, she was confused and scared of Claus and Lavie Head because she was unconscious during the whole ordeal. She wanted to know whatever happened to her previous guardians, but Claus and Lavie made up an excuse that they were simply away. Al's intuition was enough for her to figure out they are dead. During the night while Claus planned their route, the Guild already caught up to their house and had to make an early run before morning. They did not run far before the Guild fighter caught up to them. At the last moment Alex used a pistol to kill the pilot and recovered their "cargo." Al was knocked out during the Guild fighter assault. After she came to, she woke up again to new strangers ("Silvana" crew). Claus during that time didn't like Alex's facial expression and worries the safety of Al. He steals highly purified fuel from what's left of the Guild fighter and flew to the "Silvana" to find Al.
After everyone was reunited, Claus remained with the "Silvana" crew to look after Lavie and protect Al. Al does not know of her importance, but learns of it while under the care of the "Silvana". Al is revealed to be member of the Guild House of Hamilton which has the ability to control "Exile" and unlocking it by knowing the answers to the questions that form the Mysterion (see below). The Guild's Maestro Delphine Eraclea kidnapped Al and Claus to discover the secrets of "Exile". She needed to recite all four passages, but Alex was smart enough to not know of the fourth and final one should he ever get captured and interrogated.
After Lucciola helped Al and Claus escape from the Guild, Al ended up back in Norkia with Claus. They ventured back into the Grand Stream to use the vanship Lavie worked so hard on to adapt to Grand Stream conditions. After they entered the domain, Al and Claus got to the other side of the Grand Stream, she finished reciting the poem that would unlock Exile's true form.
At the end of the series, Claus and Alvis recite the four Mysteria, allowing "Exile" to shed its defensive cocoon and reveal itself. The Mysteria, in their correct order of recitation, and their responses are:
Supporting characters.
The majority of the events in "Last Exile" occurred on the fictional lone aerial battleship and aircraft carrier . The ship is known as the "Kill-'em-all" "Silvana" for its reputation of destroying other battleships regardless of which faction they belong to. Because it has never lost in a battle, the ship became an object of superstition and rumor. Despite being powered by a Claudia unit of Guild origin, the "Silvana" cannot be controlled by the Guild because the unit itself was stolen. The ship also employs armaments that differ from battleships used by the Anatoray navy. They were developed in secrecy and use a propellant fluid system rather a steam-based one.
The nation of is at risk of experiencing drought. The nation of , on the other hand, is experiencing a deep freeze. Anatoray Prime Minister Marius Bassianus likened Disith to a "wounded lion" after its lands fell into a deep freeze due to climate changes.
Alexander Row.
Twenty-eight-year-old Alexander Row, or most commonly known as , acts as the captain of the "Silvana". In the series, he is portrayed as emotionally distant from the other characters, including his first officer, who resembles his deceased fiancée . Alex's actions are driven by one purpose: to kill Guild Maestro Delphine Eraclea, whom he holds responsible for his fiancée's death. After being confronted about his past, Alex reveals himself to be a friend of the legendary vanship duo of Hamilcar Valca and Georges Head and the former owner of Claus's and Lavie's vanship. Character designer Range Murata has described the character as a "loner". Alex Row was based on Captain Harlock, a space pirate character created by manga artist Leiji Matsumoto. According to Murata, the design for his clothing "turned out all black, no matter how carefully or subtly I put in the lines; they were all the same when I colored it in". Animators also experienced difficulties in animating his hair and flowing cape.
Sophia Forrester.
Marius tells her to love "all subjects, not just one man".
At times in the series, she feels that she is unloved, both by Row's visible actions to her and her father's response to her when she returns to the capital city. On her final night on the "Silvana", she put her hair down. Since this gave her an even stronger resemblance to Euris, Alex's dead fiancee, Alex wasn't pleased at all with her appearance and told her off, calling her free flowing hair unbecoming of an officer. Feeling down she went outside to look at the skies when Claus Valca happened to be there and they had a heartful conversation. Sophia felt better after talking to Claus and even gave him his first kiss on the lips. With the death of her father, she becomes empress of Anatoray and sought the alliance of Disith against the Guild, having realized that the Guild was playing both countries against each other. She became the captain of the "Silvana" after Alex's capture, having ordered the ship to attack the Guild's flagship, with Alex and Maestro Delphine Eraclea on board.
Tatiana Wisla.
With her trusted friend, confidant, and navigator, Alister Agrew, she quickly becomes one of the most dreaded forces in the sky next to the Silvana herself, for which the technicians on board the "Silvana" start calling her the "princess." Her cold demeanor manages to alienate even her close friend Alister. This leads to Alister flying with Claus Valca as his "navi" (short for "navigator") for a time, both as a rebuke to Tatiana and because Claus's navigator, Lavie Head, does not want to fly any more combat missions.
Tatiana is second best to none in her own mind, but her overconfident self-view is challenged when she meets Claus, whose piloting skills rival her own. From then on, her feelings toward Claus go on a roller coaster, making her feel anger, disgust, awe, respect, fear, and even attraction to the young vanship pilot. Her frosty aloofness is clearly a self-defensive façade; she suffers a mental breakdown of sorts after getting shot down over the desert, but recovers, and from that time she begins to show a greater depth of feeling, especially towards Claus, whom she develops a crush on.
In "Last Exile: Fam, the Sliver Wing", Tatiana is now Captain of the Submersible Aircraft Carrier Silvius with Alister as her Vice-Captain.
Alister Agrew.
, or "Alis" to her friends, is Tatiana Wisla's trusted confidant, best friend of the same age, and expert navigator. By her nature she is very quiet, reserved, and otherwise unflappable, reacting very little to even the strangest of circumstances. Her only reactions are shown in the way she carries herself, and the quickest way to earn her loyalty is to not dismiss her, or act like she is not around. From her behavior, it is shown that she is a consummate professional, just like Tatiana, which explains why they work so well together. However, she is far more than that, but will do nothing to prove it outright. She has displayed unfathomable respect for Tatiana, a strange attraction to Claus Valca, and even motherly behavior towards Alvis Hamilton.
Alister returns in "Last Exile: Fam, the Sliver Wing" serving as Tatiana's Second-in-Command in the Submersible Aircraft Carrier Silvius.
Mullin Shetland.
At this time he meets Dunya Scheer from the Disith fleet, also involved in the operation. He and Dunya fall in love with each other, cumulating in Mullin asking Dunya to go on the same ship together. Dunya accepts his request, as the operation to take back the ship's Claudia unit begins. The operation ends with Mullin taking the unit back, but being gravely wounded in the process, believed dead. The epilogue reveals he survived and is living with Dunya on a farm with her siblings.
Vincent Alzey.
Vincent returns in "Last Exile: Fam, the Sliver Wing" serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Vanguard Unit of the United Kingdom of Anatoray-Disith
Dunya Scheer.
She is later involved as part of the ground force in the Disith operation to raze the Anatoray capital which is successfully completed. We next see her involved in the same operation Mullin Shetland is involved in; they first meet when she falls over Mullin trying to catch a dove to eat. Over the course of their training, they meet several times and eventually develop a relationship.
The relationship between her and Mullin culminates in Mullin asking Dunya if she would join him on the Silvana. Dunya accepts with the approval of other Disith soldiers and Mullin is overjoyed. The operation commenced shortly thereafter and was successful, though Mullin was gravely wounded and presumed dead. Dunya is seen crying over him. No more reference is made to either of them until the last episode where she is seen getting the message Lavie Head and Claus's fathers were supposed to have delivered over their new grave. She is then seen in the new world with the others.
Crew of the "Silvana".
Lescius Dagobert.
Sixty-six-year-old is the "Silvana"'s chief engineer and a member of one of the three Guild houses purged by Delphine Eraclea. Like other members of the Guild, he is interested in playing chess in his spare time and often provides counsel to Alex Row through the game. He is entrusted with the Mysterion held by his family but hands it to Alex on the eve of the assault against the Guild.
Lescius returns in "Last Exile: Fam, the Sliver Wing" now serving as the Silvius's chief engineer.
Anatoray's Nobility.
Marius Bassianus.
Fifty-two-year-old Prime Minister is a member of one of three Guild houses purged by Delphine Eraclea who was taken under the protection of the Anatoray royal family. After the death of his daughter Euris, Marius took care of Princess Sophia as if she were his own daughter. He and the Emperor killed each other during the Disith attack on the Anatoray capital after a dispute on Sophia's status as heir to the throne. He is entrusted with the Mysterion held by his family but surrenders it to Alex Row before his death so that it can be kept safe. His generosity is shown in the desire to grant land to Disith's people after its collapse and when he allows his Guild ship as training ground for the allied assault on Guild forces. Marius was the signatory of the proposed peace treaty with Disith that was lost ten years earlier.
David Mad-thane.
Duke is the commander of Anatoray's military defending the regions of Minagith and Norkia. Claus's and Lavie's attempt to cover his fleet's retreat in the battle at Minagith using only their vanship inspired Mad-thane. Seeing the potential of a vanship in battle, he sponsors the formation of vanship squadrons to act as fighter support in the assault against the Guild. He is portrayed as an optimistic character who wishes for peace, once believing "here is hope yet for the world's survival" after meeting Disith commander Nestor Messina. Because of this attitude, he is often ridiculed by other commanding officers in the military who deem his actions are those of a coward.
Emperor.
The of Anatoray no longer pays attention to the suffering of his people. He is the father of Sophia and, at the age of sixty-five, dies during the invasion of the capital city not by the Disith forces, but at the hands of Marius Bassianus. His death leads to the succession of Sophia to the throne.
Vitellius Glamis.
General is a secondary character introduced in episode 15 who commands the Anatoray military. Upon learning of the Emperor's death during the Disith assault on the Anatoray capital, he orders his men to defend the capital with their own lives. His ambition drives him to defy a ceasefire order with Disith to the point that he is willing to kill heir apparent Princess Sophia in order to set "the foundation of a reborn Anatoray". The sixty-year-old is killed when the "Urbanus" destroys the Scolopendra Cannon used to bombard the attacking Disith ships. His name was based on the actual historical figure Vitellius, who led the Roman Empire for several months during the Year of the Four Emperors.
Knowles.
Count is the commanding officer of the Anatoray battleship "Goliath", assigned to Mad-thane's fleet at Minagith. His ship is the first to retreat from the battlefield during the surprise attack by Disith, giving it the nickname the "Fleeing" "Goliath". Knowles is portrayed as a vain and egotistical character and orders his own face painted on the bow of the "Goliath". He unknowingly challenges Alex Row to a ship-to-ship duel but regrets his action after realizing he is facing the "Silvana". Knowles orders his men to fire before the signal to commence is fired, expecting to destroy the "Silvana" in a surprise attack, but the "Silvana" is unharmed and sinks his ship in one volley. He perishes with the entire crew of the "Goliath".
Henry Knowles.
Duke is a ranking Anatoray noble and the father of Count Knowles, whom Alex Row defeats in a ship duel. He is provided with the opportunity to seek revenge for the "unnecessary" death of his son when Alex makes an appearance at the Horizon Cave black market auction. His men captures Alex at gunpoint, but Horizon Cave experiences a blackout when bombs destroy its power generators. Alex kills Knowles's men in the confusion and escapes, leaving the sixty-nine-year-old nobleman emptyhanded.
Giancarlo.
Forty-three-year-old is the manager of the Horizon Cave station and a subordinate to Duke Henry Knowles. He also serves as an auctioneer when the supposed "Exile" artifact is opened for bidding at the black market. He takes the artifact, auctioned at 50 billion Claudia, to Maestro Delphine Eraclea but discovers it to be fake. Delphine gives him a Guild ring as a "reward", but the ring's power kills him by turning him into dust.
Others.
Nestor Messina.
Sixty-year-old is the commander of the Disith forces that invaded Anatoray. He fell victim to a blizzard in Disith, leaving him unable to open his right hand. After Sophia assumes the throne of Anatoray, she goes to parley with Nestor in hopes of forming an alliance and reveals to him the proposed peace treaty to Disith that was lost ten years earlier. Nestor ascertains Sophia's sincerity and provides Anatoray with a map of the Grand Stream and the acoustic signature of "Exile". Nestor is well respected by his Anatoray counterparts, especially by Duke David Mad-thane, because he "seems to understand the meaning of chivalry" and is unwilling to sacrifice his men in a meaningless battle.
The Guild.
The serves as the arbitrator between the Anatoray and Disith nations.
Dio Eraclea.
Principal is the sixteen-year-old younger brother of the most powerful Guild member, Maestro Delphine Eraclea. People see him as a rare find that will someday take over the Guild. He is very playful and fearless, and treats many things like they were games. His odd nature can be seen in his awe of Claus Valca's skills and giving him the nickname "Immelmann" (referring to the World War I German ace, Max Immelmann and the maneuver Claus frequently used while flying, the Immelmann turn). This strange nature is mostly due to the Guild lifestyle and fear of his sister Delphine. His first appearance in the series is marked by a chess-match with his beloved friend Lucciola and with the Guild's power and surveillance, watches the skies of a skirmish between Guild ships searching for Alvis Hamilton and the "Silvana". He finds extraordinary talent in Claus's vanship piloting, and after the Horizon Cave Eight vanship race, he starts to have strong interactions with the main characters. He later joins them on the "Silvana" in order to escape his sister. Though his initial presence with the Silvana was unwanted, his participations and interactions with Claus and Alvis eventually earn the entire crew's trust, and is acknowledged as one of them, during a birthday party proposed by Alvis. He is forced back to the Guild during the end of the series, and is brainwashed by a Guild device in preparation for the "Rite of the Covenant".
Driven to insanity, he participates in the Rite of the Covenant, where the next Maestro is chosen, and emerges victorious. He escapes with Claus and Alvis soon after and is nursed back to health in the Mad-Thane residence. He flees from there in a vanship and travels to the Grand Stream. Being delirious, his memory resets to the moment of the race in Horizon Cave, and he attempts to pass Claus. At that moment he tells his navi, Lucciola (who isn't there), to jump out so they can get more speed. He crosses a flock of rainbirds believing them to be the finish line and congratulates Lucciola on their victory and invites him to celebrate, but he then turns around to find he is not there. Believing Lucciola had actually jumped from the vanship, he attempts to cross to his seat while crying, but his vanship is then hit by a gust of wind and he is swallowed by the Grand Stream.
Despite this, his voice is heard during a later scene in the "Silvana's" engine room cheering "Ascending!" In addition, there is a scene depicted in the series' official artwork showing Claus, Lavie, and their friends living on the farm turning and smiling at an individual. Though all that can be seen is one foot and a waving hand, the individual appears to be wearing a Guild uniform. In the Last Exile Aerial Log artbook, notes by the creators revealed that Dio survived after being rescued by a passing Guild ship and later joining Claus, Lavie, and their friends journey to Earth.
In "Last Exile -Fam, The Silver Wing", Dio is a member of the Sky Pirates yet is secretly a scout for the Silvius. Since the events of Last Exile, his personality is back to normal and remembers what happen to Lucciola which he honors his late friend's memory by riding his vanship alone and telling those who ride the backseat not to touch anything.
Dio is also the Italian word for "God"; many of the Guild members have Italian names.
Lucciola.
Lucciola's name is Italian and means firefly.
Delphine Eraclea.
Maestro is the series' main antagonist, Dio's twenty-four-year-old older sister, and head of the Guild. A run-in between her and Alex Row in the past has left her the sole target of his vengeance, and one of his only goals is to personally kill Delphine. The Maestro is portrayed as a decadent aristocrat, callous and ruthless in her ways. When Lucciola decided to let Dio escape, the Maestro, feigning interest in his plea to let Dio go free, killed him with a device (in the shape of a ring) that essentially disintegrated him. However, she did not go unpunished, for Alex managed to strangle and break her neck, even though he had been tied in place by rose tendrils. Like her favorite flower, the rose, the Maestro is beautiful but dangerous. With her death and the release of "Exile" by Alvis Hamilton, the might of the Guild was broken, never to be restored again.
Delphine possesses a veritable arsenal of psychological weapons she uses frequently, which explains Dio's fear of her. She is truly heartless when it comes to the Guild, and takes great delight in the wastefulness that her people go through to attain and prepare meals, such as the meat of a type of yak from the frozen wastes, the capture of which leads to the deaths of countless hunters, Kerasion mousse, which contains an ingredient so rare only a handful is gathered each year, and catfish that took 100 gallons of First Water to remove the mud. During the Trial of Agoon, she demonstrated an ability to restore the dead to life; everyone who died in the Trial was seen scampering to her feet as she said "I have renewed your lives."
It is unknown whether she has any real combative power of her own. Due to her impossibly immense oppressive influence, she really only needs her truly loyal subordinates to do her work, namely Cicada and his attack force. The only evidence of power she may have is in that she killed off the other families and remained as the sole house of the keys to "Exile", which she stole the Mysteria from each house-except for house Hamilton's, the one she lost to Alex Row at Giancarlos' auction at the price of 500 billion Claudia.
Guild Agents.
The Maestro Delphine has many loyal Guild members at her disposal. Some include bodyguards and maids, to fighter pilots and counselors. They tend to fall into two groups: and . The names of the Guild servants all seemed to be named after insects.
The most powerful of the Maestro's entourage is , the servant to Maestro Delphine and the elder brother of Lucciola. A man of thirty-one, he is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and prevents Alex Row from assassinating Delphine when the Guild boards the "Silvana". However, Lucciola kills him in combat in front of Delphine after Claus, Alvis, and Dio escape from the Guild stronghold. 
The Maestro also has two maids, and who are part of the Maestro's Aspis. The nineteen-year-old male servants and are also a part of the Aspis. Twenty-three-year-old , twenty-six-year-old , twenty-eight-year-old , and twenty-seven-year-old are her other agents and a part of the Scutum.
Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing.
Last Exile -Fam, The Silver Wing- (ラストエグザイル～銀翼のファム～, Rasuto Eguzairu Ginyoku no Famu) is the sequel to the original Last Exile. The main character Fam Fan Fan is part of the Sky Pirates, a group that assaults ships following the code of the "First Harpoon". They target minor vessels and prosper on an isolated location, until one day they take off for a mission that will change their lives forever when they get involved in the war against the Ades Federation.
Protagonists.
Giselle Collette.
Fifteen-year-old is Fam's best friend and navigator. In contrast to the reckless Fam, she is more introverted. Giselle is the daughter of the Sky Pirate's chief, Atamora Collette. She is a very capable navigator. She also has very good knowledge regarding the architectural structure of ships, being able to draw out a detailed blueprint of internal structures just by looking at a picture of the ship itself. Being the eldest daughter, she is very capable in handling housework such as cooking and cleaning while taking care of her brothers and sisters. She is affectionately called "Gisey" by Fam.
Millia Il Velch Cutrettola Turan.
Fifteen-year-old is the younger princess of the Kingdom of Turan. Millia and her older sister Liliana have taken on the task of ruling the kingdom despite their young ages due to the illness of their father, the King of Turan. In contrast to her more composed older sister Liliana, Millia is a bit more brash and impulsive. She was also the assistant pilot for Fam, once for taking her sister Liliana's cup; and again for successfully scuttling the Ades Federation battleship Anshar, which they later restored. She can speak the Glacian language and serves as an interpreter for Fam and Giselle when speaking with Dian. She is now the interim captain of the battleship Sylvius, while captain Tatiana Wisla was gone riding with her vanship to Grand Exile. And she inherits the power of Exile after her sister was shot down by Dian while shielding Luscinia/Lukea.
Ades Federation.

Dyan rescued Fam, Giselle and Millia after the three were on the run from the Ades Federation to, as she revealed, repay a debt for Fam and Millia helping her squad mates Primula and Magnolia during the Silvius battle with the Ades 1st fleet. While she shelters them and help them repair their Vespa, Fam tries to form a friendship with Dyan despite the language barrier. She was the one who killed Princess Liliana while shielding Luscinia, but while in an attempt of killing Luscinia.
Viola.
Dian's navigator.
Primula.
A Rocket Fighter pilot who goes by the Call sign "03". She and her navigator Magnolia were saved by Fam and Millia after their vanship hits a rock during the battle between the Ades 1st Fleet and the Sylvius.
Magnolia.
Primula's navigator who can speak the common language that is spoken on Earth. Since she is at odds with Millia after her sister Liliana sent an Exile to defeat Glacies, she becomes Dian's interpreter.
Merchandise.
A 136-page art book containing character sketches and supplemental material was published in 2005 but has since gone out of print. Murata has also released several self-published art books, under the collective title of "SPHERES", containing additional character and design sketches used in "Last Exile" promotional posters.
Seven promotional busts were made by Alter, a Japanese figure company, in 2006 depicting Claus, Lavie, Alvis, Tatiana, Alex, Dio and Lucciola as chess pieces. The seventh figure was of the iconic silver vanship.
Reception.
Reviewers have praised Murata's work in designing the characters of "Last Exile". South African magazine "New Age Gaming" called him an artist "who is quickly making a name for himself with a style that is as recognizable as works by artists like Masamune Shirow or Tetsuya Nomura". (Shirow is known for his work in "Ghost in the Shell", and Nomura is known for his work in the "Final Fantasy" series.) His signature style is easily distinguishable and can also be recognized from "Blue Submarine No. 6" and his art book "Robot and Rule". According to the magazine, "his female characters have very round, cue-ball like heads you just want to sink in the corner pocket". The unique style also brought some reviewers to believe that the series more resembles a work of Hayao Miyazaki rather than Gonzo.
The English dubbed version of the series, first released by Geneon Entertainment, was also well received by reviewers. Geneon hired Bang Zoom! Entertainment to produce the dubbed version of "Last Exile", which Ryan Mathews of Anime News Network has praised as "the best Bang Zoom dub of all I've experienced". Production of the English version of the series was directed by Eric Sherman. Mathews goes on to say that "he role of spunky young Lavie is a perfect fit for [Kari Wahlgren]". On the other hand, Johnny Yong Bosch's performance as Claus Valca was called "one of his softest performances". The dubbed version also demonstrated "a clear delineation…in terms of emotionality and overall tone" between the two main characters and the crew of the "Silvana". A comparison to the original Japanese version of "Last Exile" shows that the English adaptation stays true to the original dialogue and only deviates to accommodate for pacing.

Electromagnetic oscillograph

An electromagnetic oscillograph is an oscillograph which measures variations of electric current by having it go through a magnetic coil. Variations in current induce momentum in the coil, which can be directly measured.
The electromagnetic oscillograph was invented by William Duddell. 
Some models utilise a mirror which reflects a beam of light, allowing measurement of minute movements of the coil. Other were fitted with a hand, possibly fitted with a pen to record values.

4th Special Service Brigade

The 4th Special Service Brigade was created in March 1944 from units of the Royal Marines. Due to the success of the Army Commandos’ operations in Norway, the Channel Islands, St. Nazaire, and the Middle East, the Admiralty dissolved the Marine Division in late 1942 and reorganized its amphibious assault infantry into eight additional Commando units.
The Brigade landed in Normandy on 6 June 1944 during Operation "Overlord"; it subsequently participated in the Battle of the Scheldt and the assault of the Walcheren Islands. On 6 December the same year, the Brigade was renamed 4th Commando Brigade, removing the hated title "Special Service" and its association with the German SS.
Normandy.
The Plan.
The brigade's task was to secure the flanks of the invasion beaches, linking up the British front from the Orne River to Port-en-Bessin and the Americans on Omaha Beach. 
The newly-raised 46 and 47 Commandos joined 41 Commando and it became apparent to the Allied planners that a fourth Commando unit was needed for the brigade’s mission, so in mid-March the remaining men of the Royal Marine Division and other volunteers began training to form No. 48 Commando in time for the invasion. The Brigade was expected to be in combat for at most a week before being returned home.
Sword Beach.
No 41 RM Commando was the senior unit in the Brigade, it landed at Hermanville-sur-Mer and then moved west to Lion-sur-Mer. The unit's first task was to link up with their fellow commandos at Luc-sur-Mer. 
As the Commando came ashore under moderate fire, it lost several men including their Regimental Sergeant Major, the Naval Forward Observation Officer and the second-in-command.
Once clear of the beach defences it found itself in a relatively quiet sector. From its assembly area, it marched down the coastal road toward Lion-sur-Mer joined by three Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE)s. As P and Y troops approached the town, a well-concealed German PaK 38 gun ambushed the tanks, knocking all three out and stalling the assault. 
A and B troops had been moving ahead on to their second objective at the Chateau, but were attacked on their approach and forced back. Facing overwhelming defences and artillery, the commandos dug in and awaited reinforcements. 
At 1330 Hours battalions of the Lincolnshire Regiment and the Royal Ulster Rifles moved up to the commandos' position, bringing with them a replacement Naval Observation Officer. As soon as he arrived, the destroyers offshore began a one hour-long naval bombardment, battering the strong point and chateau. It was now too late for the commandos to launch an effective assault, so they dug-in for the night. 
When dawn broke the German artillery fire began once again, pinning the commandos and supporting infantry down for another two hours. They were then subject to a bombing attack by German Heinkel bombers which dropped anti-personnel bombs onto their position, killing several men, including their royal artillery observer and severely wounding the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Gray. Having already lost the second-in-command, Major Barclay, command fell to the Adjutant John Taplin. Under his leadership the Commando joined the Lincolnshire Regiment in the final assault on the strongpoint and chateau. Once the two units had seized the position, 41 Commando moved on alone to Luc-sur-mer. They found the town undefended and dug-in to wait for their colleagues to join them from the Canadian beach.
Juno Beach (48 Commando).
48 Commando were to land at Nan Red sector of Juno Beach with the objective of assaulting the strongpoint at Langrune-sur-Mer and then to link-up with 41 Commando, sealing the breach between the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the British 3rd Infantry Divisions. On their approach to the shore, two of their ships struck underwater obstacles and sank. Weighed down by their equipment, many of the marines drowned in the surf. Those that did get ashore faced intense German small arms fire. The combined effect of these two situations was that only fifty percent of the Commando got off the beach unscathed. 
Once off the beach, 48 Commando advanced to their objective, the heavily defended guns at Langrune. As they approached, the destroyer HMS "Vigilant" bombarded the position, with little effect due to the heavy fortifications. The commandos found the strong-point protected by snipers, mines, machine guns and a concrete wall. 
They were then joined by two Centaur Support Tanks from the 1st Royal Marine Support Regiment. The first of these tanks moved toward the wall firing its 95mm howitzer and obliterated a machine-gun bunker that had been covering the crossroads. The second Centaur began to move into position, but struck a mine while approaching the wall, forcing the crew to bail out and join the commandos. With the Centaurs out of ammunition or disabled, the attack faltered. B Troop raced across the intersection to a house opposite only to discover that it had been fortified, with the windows and doors facing the strongpoint filled with concrete. The commandos had no choice but to bring down the wall. They set a charge at its base, but the fortification was too strong. 
The commandos then received news that the 21st Panzer Division’s counter-attack had already stopped the British advance on Caen and was pushing on toward Lion-sur-Mer. The commandos were ordered to cease the assault and take up defensive positions. The German Panzer grenadiers reached the 716th Infantry Division's positions only to find that they were still manned and situated between the two units of the 4th Special Service Brigade. 
In the morning the commandos were joined by a pair of Canadian M10 Wolverine tank destroyers, which fired anti-tank rounds at the wall; for the next hour the M10s peppered the wall with solid shot and the fortification began to disintegrate. A Sherman tank of the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group then appeared and opened fire on the wall and allowed the commandos to launch an assault. Advancing behind the Sherman, covered by its guns, the commandos seized the interior of the strongpoint and spent the rest of the day silencing the remaining pockets of resistance around Langrune.
Juno Beach (46 Commando).
The brigade’s reserve element, No. 46 Commando, landed on Juno beach at 0900 on 7 June and advanced on to Petit Enfer. They faced stiff German resistance, but were able to force their way through the German positions and on to Luc-sur-Mer. There they met up with 41 Commando, linking Juno and Sword Beaches.
Gold Beach.
No. 47 Commando was the last British unit to land and came ashore on Gold Beach east of Le Hamel. Their task was to go inland then turn right (west) and make a ten-mile (16 km) march through enemy territory to attack Port en Bessin from the rear. This small harbour, on the British far right, was well sheltered in the chalk cliffs and significant in that it was to be a prime means of supplies being brought in, including fuel by underwater pipe-line from tankers moored offshore.
On 47's approach they could see the preceding units were struggling. Due to intense fire, the Hampshire Regiment had landed one and a half miles further to the east than originally planned. 
Unable to locate Phillips, the second-in-command, Major P.M. Donnell led his men off the beach and turned inland to avoid engaging the enemy. Behind the lines, the commando moved quickly to Buhot where Phillips rejoined it after his long swim. For the next several hours the Commando pushed steadily on, occasionally encountering snipers and small units of unsuspecting rear guards from whom they captured several "spandau" (MG-34 machine guns) and other small arms. As dusk descended upon the Commando they reached Point 72, the highest point on a ridge near Escures, which they discovered was undefended. They dug-in for the night and prepared for the attack on Port-en-Bessin at dawn. 
Originally the attack on Port-en-Bessin was planned to be supported by American artillery, but having no working radio made this coordination impossible. The arrival of two French civilians, a replacement Forward Observation Officer and a Gendarme named Gouget, assisted the planned assault. The two civilians identified the German positions and the artillery officer repaired the unit’s wireless set, allowing him to contact the navy ships off-shore. 
Philips next ordered his men to launch an assault on the "Flak" ships, but were repelled once again. Seeing their problem, the captains of HMS "Ursa" and the Polish ship ORP "Krakowiak" approached the port, but were unable to open fire on the "Flak" ships, which were behind the port’s concrete and stone breakwater. The navy then formed boarding parties and launched their motorboats, which crossed the harbour net and attacked the German vessels. 
With the "Flak" ships silenced, B and Heavy weapons troops made their way up the eastern feature and assaulted the German blockhouse, forcing the defenders to surrender. Sporadic fighting continued on until dawn of 8 June when the remaining defenders on the western feature surrendered. 
On 9 June "PLUTO" (Pipe Line Under the Ocean) fuel pipe, arrived in the form of an army port company and the petrol started to flow, supplying Allied vehicles across the Normandy front.
Douvre Radar Station.
After being rested and reinforced, the Brigade less NO. 41 Commando, moved south to the Douvre Radar Station. This fortified position was the primary Luftwaffe radar station in the area. It was covered with gun pits, minefields, tunnels, bunkers, five 5 cm anti-tank guns, a 7.5 cm field gun and a ring of barbed wire in height. The Brigade was to isolate the station which would allow other Allied forces to pass by and advance on Caen. 
After securing the perimeter, 46, 47 and 48 Commandos were sent to support the Canadians and Airborne divisions while 41 Commando stayed behind. For the next week, the commandos continued to harass the strongpoint with occasional mortar fire, Typhoon strikes and volleys from two attached Royal Marine Support Group (RMASG) Centaurs. Although the site did not actively threaten Allied movements in the area, it did provide radar-ranging information for Luftwaffe night fighters and constantly reported on British movements. 
On 17 June the assault began with a bombardment from the Royal Artillery’s guns and ships off-shore. Under their new commander, Lt. Col Palmer, 41 Commando and forty-four armoured engineering vehicles attacked from the north while other tanks created a diversion from the southwest. Sherman Crabs (a mine-clearing tank), cleared the way through the minefields while the AVREs battered the bunkers with their guns. The effect of such fire was devastating on the German defenders. When the commandos entered the entrenchment and opened fire, it was clear that the station could no longer be defended. The two hundred and twenty seven remaining Luftwaffe force surrendered and the last of the 4th Special Service Brigade’s D-Day objectives was finally achieved.
6th Airborne Division.
The Brigade less No 41 Commando moved to the Orne River, where they joined 1st Special Service Brigade and the 6th Airborne Division, under the command of Major General Richard 'Windy' Gale. The Brigade would remain in the Orne area until mid-August while the British Second Army launched a series of assaults on Caen.
In mid-August, following the capture of Caen, General Gale’s forces broke out of their positions and launched a major offensive. Before sunrise on 20 August, 46 Commando launched an attack on the heights above Putot and the commandos seized the position overlooking the entire Dozulé area. For the remainder of the day, 48 Commando pushed through the bocage, without support, to Point 134 and Point 120 followed by 41 Commando. This location nearly cut the Germans escape route from the town; realizing that they had been out-flanked, they set the village ablaze and withdrew.
With Dozulé captured the Commandos pushed on through Beuzeville to the Risle River. On many occasions the commandos and airborne troops would arrive in a village less than hour after the Germans had made a hasty withdrawal. 
Following the capture of Pont-Audemer, the 6th Airborne and 1st Special Service Brigade were relieved by the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and returned to England. Leaving behind the 4th Special Service Brigade, which remained in the area for several weeks, clearing pockets of resistance between the Seine and Valmont, they then took up the role of garrison troops in and around the shattered city of Le Havre before finally moving up to positions near Dunkirk where they probed the German lines with small raids.
Walcheren Islands.
On 27 September the Brigade was withdrawn to an assembly area in De Haan, Belgium. It then prepared for another amphibious assault, on the Dutch island of Walcheren. The island lay at the mouth of the Scheldt River, which ran from Antwerp to the sea. Until the island and the northern banks of the river were cleared, the port could not be used to support the Allied advance. Allied bombers breached the dykes on 3 October at Westkapelle, Flushing and Veere, flooding the island, leaving only a few dry areas around its perimeter and greatly restricting the Germans’ freedom of movement.
The 4th Special Service Brigade formed the seaborne element of the attack while British and Canadian infantry attacked overland from the mainland. This time the commandos came ashore in Landing Vehicle Tracked, (also known as Buffaloes), which had already proven their worth in the Pacific campaign. 41 Commando was tasked with assaulting the town of Westkapelle and then to move north along the causeway to Domburg. Just to their south, 48 Commando took on a radar station and naval gun battery, while 47 completed the encirclement of the western part of the island by moving south towards Flushing. 
The brigade would spend the rest of the war making raids across the Maas River in Operations "Incalculable" and "Bogart". 
After occupation duties in Germany, the Brigade returned to the United Kingdom in 1946 and was disbanded.
Battle honours.
The following Battle honours were awarded to the British Commandos during the Second World War:

Coffee production in Indonesia

Indonesia is the fourth largest producer of coffee in the world. Coffee in Indonesia began with its colonial history, and has played an important part in the growth of the country. Indonesia is located within an ideal geography for coffee plantations. The longitude and latitude of the country means that the island origins are all well suited micro-climates for the growth and production of coffee, resulting in widespread environmental degradation and the destruction of tropical rainforests that have the highest concentration of endemic species in the world.
Indonesia produced 420,000 metric tons of coffee in 2007. Of this total, 271,000 tons were exported and 148,000 tons were consumed domestically. Of the exports, 25% are arabica beans; the balance is robusta. In general, Indonesia’s arabica coffees have low acidity and strong body, which makes them ideal for blending with higher acidity coffees from Central America and East Africa.
History.
The Dutch governor in Malabar (India) sent a Yemeni or arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) seedling to the Dutch governor of Batavia (now Jakarta) in 1696. The first seedlings failed due to flooding in Batavia. The second shipment of seedlings was sent in 1699. The plants grew, and in 1711 the first exports were sent from Java to Europe by the Dutch East India Company, known by its Dutch initials VOC (Vereeningde Oost-Indische Company which was established in 1602. Within 10 years, exports rose to 60 tons per year. Indonesia was the first place, outside of Arabia and Ethiopia, where coffee was widely cultivated. VOC monopolized coffee trading in 1725 to 1780.
The coffee was shipped to Europe from the port of Batavia (now Jakarta). There has been a port at the mouth of Ciliwung River since 397 AD, when King Purnawarman established the city he called Sunda Kelapa. Today, in the Kota area of Jakarta, one can find echoes of the seagoing legacy that built the city. Sail driven ships still load cargo in the old port. The Bahari museum occupies a former warehouse of the VOC, which was used to store spices and coffee. Menara Syahbandar (or Lookout Tower) was built in 1839 to replace the flag pole that stood at the head of wharves, where the VOC ships docked to load their cargos.
In the 18th century, coffee shipped from Batavia sold for 3 Guilders per kilogram in Amsterdam. Since annual incomes in Holland in the 18th century were between 200 to 400 Guilders, this was equivalent of several hundred dollars per kilogram today. By the end of the 18th century, the price had dropped to 0.6 Guilders per kilogram and coffee drinking spread from the elite to the general population.
The coffee trade was very profitable for the VOC, but less so for the Indonesian farmers who were forced to grow it by the colonial government. In theory, production of export crops was meant to provide cash for Javanese villagers to pay their taxes. This was in Dutch known as the Cultuurstelsel (Cultivation system), and it covered spices and a wide range of other tropical cash crops. Cultuur stelsel was initiated on coffee at Preanger region of West Java. In practice however, the prices set for the cash crops by the government were too low and they diverted labor from rice production, causing great hardship for farmers.
By mid 1870s the Dutch East Indies expanded arabica coffee growing areas in Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi and Timor. In Sulawesi the coffee was first planted in 1850. In North Sumatra highlands coffee was first grown near Lake Toba in 1888, followed in Gayo highland (Aceh) near Lake Laut Tawar in 1924.
In 1860, a Dutch colonial official, Eduard Douwes Dekker, wrote a book called "Max Havelaar and the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company", which exposed the oppression of villagers by corrupt and greedy officials. This book helped to change Dutch public opinion about the "Cultivation System" and colonialism in general. More recently, the name Max Havelaar was adopted by one of the first fair trade organizations.
In the late eighteen hundreds, Dutch colonialists established large coffee plantations on the Ijen Plateau in eastern Java. However, disaster struck in the 1876, when the coffee rust disease swept through Indonesia, wiping out most of Typica cultivar. Robusta coffee (C. canephor var. robusta) was introduced to East Java in 1900 as a substitute, especially at lower altitudes, where the rust was particularly devastating. In the 1920s smallholders throughout Indonesia began to grow coffee as a cash crop.
The plantations on Java were nationalized at independence and revitalized with new varieties of Coffea arabica in the 1950s. These varieties were also adopted by smallholders through the government and various development programs.
Origins.
In the early days, the prominent coffee under Dutch rule was "Coffea arabica". The coffee was introduced to the archipelago via Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka). The Dutch Colonial Government initially planted coffee around Batavia (Jakarta), and as far south as Sukabumi and Bogor, in the 17th century. Coffee plantations were also established in East Java, Central Java, West Java and in parts of Sumatra and Sulawesi. Coffee at the time was also grown in East Indonesia- East Timor and Flores. Both of these islands were originally under Portuguese control and the coffee was also "C. arabica," but from different root stocks. The coffee in Eastern Indonesia was not affected to the same degree by rust, and even today, some coffee in East Timor can be traced back to the 16th and 17th century.
A rust plague in the late 1880s killed off much of the plantation stocks in Sukabumi, before spreading to Central Java and parts of East Java. Around the start of the 20th century, the "C. arabica" crops were devastated by coffee rust, wiping out the bulk of the Dutch root-stocks. The Dutch responded by replacing the "C. arabica" firstly with "Coffea liberica" (a tough, but somewhat unpalatable coffee) and later with "Coffea robusta". The popularity of this species was short lived as it was also affected by disease. The "C. liberica" cherry can still be found throughout Java, but is seldom used as a commercial crop in Indonesia. The "C. liberica" bean is much larger than either the arabica or the robusta cherry; however, it shares more in common cupping wise with robusta.
Cultivation.
Today, more than 90% of Indonesia’s coffee is grown by smallholders on farms averaging one hectare or less. Much of the production is organic and 19 farmers’ cooperatives and exporters are internationally certified to market organic coffee.
There are more than 20 varieties of Coffea arabica being grown commercially in Indonesia. They fall into six main categories:
Sumatra, Mandheling, Lintong and Gayo.
Coffee from this western-most island in Indonesia is intriguing and complex, due to the large number of small-holder producers and the unique "giling basah" (wet hulling) processing technique they use. At the green bean stage, coffee from this area has a distinctive bluish colour, which is attributed to processing method and lack of iron in the soil.
Coffees from Sumatra are known for smooth, sweet body that is balanced and intense. Depending on the region, or blend of regions, the flavours of the land and processing can be very pronounced. Notes of cocoa, tobacco, smoke, earth and cedar wood can show well in the cup. Occasionally, Sumatran coffees can show greater acidity, which balances the body. This acidity takes on tropical fruit notes and sometimes an impression of grapefruit or lime.
Mandheling is a trade name, used for arabica coffee from northern Sumatra. It was derived from the name of the Mandailing people, who produce coffee in the Tapanuli region of Sumatra. Mandheling coffee comes from Northern Sumatra, as well as Aceh.
Lintong coffee is grown in the District of Lintongnihuta, to the south-west of Lake Toba. This large lake is one of the deepest in the world, at 505 meters. The coffee production area is a high plateau, known for its diversity of tree fern species. This area produces 15,000 to 18,000 tons of arabica per year. A neighbouring region, called Sidikilang, also produces arabica coffee.
Gayo Mountain coffee is grown on the hillsides surrounding the town of Takegon and Lake Tawar, at the northern tip of Sumatra, in the region of Aceh. The altitude in the production area averages between 1,110 and 1,300 meters. The coffee is grown by small-holders under shade trees.
Coffee from this region is generally processed at farm-level, using traditional wet methods. Due to the giling basha processing, Gayo Mountain coffee is described as higher toned and lighter bodied than Lintong and Mandheling coffees from further east in Sumatra.
Sulawesi, Toraja, Kalosi, Mamasa and Gowa.
The Indonesian island of Sulawesi, formerly called the Celebes, lies to the north of Flores. The primary region for high altitude Arabica production is a mountainous area called Tana Toraja, at the central highlands of South Sulawesi. To the south of Toraja is the region of Enrekang. The capital of this region is Kalosi, which is a well-known brand of speciality coffee. The regions of Mamasa (to the west of Toraja) and Gowa (to the south of Kalosi), also produce arabica, although they are less well known.
Unlike many of Indonesia’s islands, Sulawesi is geologically ancient, dating back more than 100 million years. This long history has resulted in soils with a high iron content – thought to affect coffee flavor.
Sulawesi coffees are clean and sound in the cup. They generally display nutty or warm spice notes, like cinnamon or cardamom. Hints of black pepper are sometimes found. Their sweetness, as with most Indonesian coffees, is closely related to the body of the coffee. The after-taste coats the palate on the finish and is smooth and soft.
Most of Sulawesi's coffee is grown by small-holders, with about 5% coming from seven larger estates. The people of Tana Toraja build distinctively shaped houses and maintain ancient and complex rituals related to death and the afterlife. This respect for tradition is also found in way that small-holders process their coffee. Sulawesi farmers use a unique process called "giling basah" (wet hulling).
Java.
West Java is the earliest plantation area acquired by VOC in East Indies back in 18th century. Coffee was planted in Priangan area, such as in Sumedang. Today the Paniis coffee planters cooperation in Sumedang can produce 15 tonnes, 2.5 tonnes of them are produced as kopi luwak. Java's arabica coffee production is centred on the Ijen Plateau, at the eastern end of Java, at an altitude of more than 1,400 meters. The coffee is primarily grown on large estates that were built by the Dutch in the 18th century. The five largest estates are Blawan (also spelled Belawan or Blauan), Jampit (or Djampit), Pancoer (or Pancur), Kayumas and Tugosari, and they cover more than 4,000 hectares.
These estates transport ripe cherries quickly to their mills after harvest. The pulp is then fermented and washed off, using the wet process, with rigorous quality control. This results in coffee with good, heavy body and a sweet overall impression. They are sometimes rustic in their flavour profiles, but display a lasting finish. At their best, they are smooth and supple and sometimes have a subtle herbaceous note in the after-taste.
This coffee is prized as one component in the traditional “Mocca Java” blend, which pairs coffee from Yemen and Java.
Certain estates age a portion of their coffee for up to five years, normally in large burlap sacks, which are regularly aired, dusted, and flipped. As they age, the beans turn from green to light brown, and their flavour gains strength while losing acidity. Aged coffees can display flavours ranging from cedar to spices such as cinnamon or clove, and often develop a thick, almost syrupy body. These aged coffees are called Old Government, Old Brown or Old Java.
Bali.
The highland plateau of Kintamani, between the volcanoes of Batukaru and Agung, is the main coffee growing area. Many coffee farmers on Bali are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of "Tri Hita Karana". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade and organic coffee production.
Stakeholders in Bali, including the Subak Abian, have created Indonesia's first Geographic Indication (G.I.). Once it is recognized by the government, this G.I. will protect Kintamani coffee from blending or mis-labeling.
Generally, Balinese coffee is carefully processed under tight control, using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes.
Sumbawa.
The western slopes of Mount Tambora in Sanggar peninsula is the main coffee-growing area in Sumbawa island, thus the coffee from this area is marketed as Tambora coffee. The intensive coffee plantation were begun in colonial era after the area was cleared up because of the eruption of Tambora volcano in 1815. However archaeological findings discover some coffee seeds in Tambora culture sites suggesting the local Tambora and Pekat kingdoms already cultivating the seeds acquired from Dutch East Indies Company, grow and harvest them and trade with them.
Flores.
Flores (or Flower) Island is 360 miles long, and is located 200 miles to the east of Bali. The terrain of Flores is rugged, with numerous active and inactive volcanoes. Ash from these volcanoes has created especially fertile Andosols, ideal for organic coffee production. Arabica coffee is grown at 1,200 to 1,800 meters on hillsides and plateaus. Most of the production is grown under shade trees and wet processed at farm level. Coffee from Flores is known for sweet chocolate, floral and woody notes.
Papua.
New Guinea is the second largest island in the world. The western half of New Guinea is part of Indonesia. The Indonesian half of the island was formerly called "Irian Jaya". Today, it is known as Papua, and it is divided into two provinces – Papua and West Papua.
There are two main coffee growing areas in Papua. The first is the Baliem Valley, in the central highlands of the Jayawijaya region, surrounding the town of Wamena. The second is the Kamu Valley in the Nabire Region, at the eastern edge of the central highlands, surrounding the town of Moanemani. Both areas lie at altitudes between 1,400 and 2000 meters, creating ideal conditions for Arabica production.
Together, these areas produce about 230 tons of coffee per year. This is set to rise, as new companies are setting up buying and processing operations. One of them is Koperasi Serba Usaha Baliem Arabica or commonly known in Indonesia as Koperasi Serba Usaha Baliem Arabica. These companies are assisting farmers to obtain organic and fair trade certification, which will significantly improve incomes. The area is extremely remote, with most coffee growing areas inaccessible by road and nearly untouched by the modern world.
All coffee is shade grown under "Calliandra", "Erythrina" and "Albizia" trees. Farmers in Papua use a wet hulled process. Chemical fertilizer pesticide and herbicide are unknown in this origin, which makes this coffee both rare and valuable.
Harvesting and processing.
All arabica coffee in Indonesia is picked by hand, whether it is grown by small-holders or on medium-sized estates. After harvest, the coffee is processed in a variety of ways, each imparting its own flavours and aromas to the final product.
A small number of farmers in Sulawesi, Flores and Bali use the most traditional method of all, dry processing. The coffee cherries are dried in the sun, and then de-hulled in a dry state.
Most farmers on Sulawesi, Sumatra, Flores, and Papua use a unique process, called "giling basah" (or wet hulling). In this technique, farmers remove the outer skin from the cherries mechanically, using rustic pulping machines, called "luwak". The coffee beans, still coated with mucilage, are then stored for up to a day. Following this waiting period, the mucilage is washed off and the coffee is partially dried for sale.
Collectors and processors then hull the coffee in a semi-wet state, which gives the beans a distinctive bluish-green appearance. This process reduces acidity and increases body, resulting in the classic Indonesian cup profile.
Larger processing mills, estates and some farmers' cooperatives on Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi and Bali produce “fully washed” coffee.
The most unusual form of coffee processing in Indonesia is "Kopi Luwak". This coffee is processed by the Asian Palm Civet ("Paradoxurus hermaphoditus"). The animals eat ripe coffee cherries and their digestive process removes the outer layers of the fruit. The remaining coffee beans are collected and washed. Coffee experts believe that the unique flavour of Kopi Luwak comes, at least in part, from the extraction of naturally occurring potassium salts from the beans during the digestive process. This results in a smooth, mild cup, with a sweet after-taste. Kopi Luwak is very rare, and can retail for more than $600 per kilogram.
Coffee research.
The Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) is located in Jember, Java. Current activities of ICCRI in the coffee sector include:
The Agribusiness Market and Support Activity (AMARTA) is conducting research on the effectiveness of the Brocap Trap technology in Toraja, Sidikilang and Gayo. This trap is designed to catch the Coffee Cherry Borer (CCB) insect, a major pest in coffee. It was developed by CIRAD, a French agricultural research institute. Brocap traps have been extensively adopted by coffee farmers in Central America
Coffee associations.
Indonesia's coffee industry is represented by two associations. The Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE), also known by its Indonesian acronym "AEKI", is composed of Arabica and Robusta coffee exporters. AICE was founded in 1979 and it issues compulsory export licenses for coffee.
The Specialty Coffee Association of Indonesia (SCAI) formed in 2008. SCAI members focus exclusively on the production, export and marketing of Indonesia's arabica coffees. This includes farmers' cooperatives with 8,050 members, exporters, roasters, importers and coffee retailers in the Arabic coffee industry.
Current status of the industry.
"Coffea robusta" replaced "C. liberica" and is still the stock crop today. It is not the coffee Indonesia is famous for, but makes up some 88% of exports from the country.
Disaster (disease and natural), World War II and the struggle for independence all played a big part in the changes that are seen in Indonesian coffee today. In the early part of the 20th century, the coffee industry was controlled by Dutch plantation owners and the colonial government. Infrastructure was developed in East and Central Java in particular to make the shipping of commodities such as coffee as easy as possible. Prior to World War II, Central Java in particular had a very strong rail transportation system that brought coffee, sugar, pepper, tea and tobacco out of the province to the port city of Semarang. Coffee in Central Java was primarily robusta, while the government estates (Kayu Mas, Blewan, Jampit) in East Java were arabica. The mountain area stretching from Jember in East Java through to the port of Banyuwangi was heavily planted in both "C. arabica" and "C. robusta". Arabica was farmed on plantations at higher elevations, while robusta was grown at lower elevations.
In January 2007, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) reported that land was illegally cleared for coffee farming in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on the island of Sumatra. The protected park is home to endangered tigers, elephants and rhinos, and WWF predicts that these species will be extinct in a decade should the clearing and farming continue. WWF states that the illegal coffee is sold to Western companies such as Nestlé and Kraft Foods.
After independence, the plantations throughout Indonesia either came under the control of the new government or were abandoned. Today close to 92% of coffee production is in the hands of small farmers or cooperatives.
Robusta coffee.
"Coffea robusta" is grown at lower altitudes than "C. arabica". The island of Sumatra is the largest producer, with the provinces of Lampung, South Sumatra and Bengkulu accounting for 75% of "C. canephora" production. Smaller volumes are grown in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and Flores.
Robusta is grown on small farms that average one hectare. The crop is harvested by stripping off all the fruit on the branch, resulting in a mix of ripe and green cherries. The unripe cherries are one reason that robusta coffee tastes bitter. Farmers dry the coffee cherries whole, for up to three weeks. After the drying, the dry cherries are hulled. Farmers sell the cherries to collectors, who sell them to the exporters. The exporters dry the crop to 12 to 13% moisture, and it is then sorted and graded. Exports are usually made in break bulk shipments, rather than in containers as with "C. arabica".
A small portion of the crop is harvested and processed more like "C. arabica". Only ripe cherries are harvested and these are processed by washing. Prices for "fully washed" robusta are close to arabica prices.
Most of Indonesia's robusta is used in instant coffee and other manufactured products. The domestic market consumes about 150,000 metric tons of robusta annually. Export coffee is sold through the New York Coffee Exchange (NYCE). The main markets are the United States, western Europe and Japan. Demand from emerging markets such as Russia, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia is increasing.
Robusta is also an important part of traditional espresso blends, where it adds characteristic flavours and the all important crema on top of the coffee.

Betel container

The betel container is made of embossed gold and filigree work set with rubies and emeralds. It was made in Burma (now Myanmar) in the nineteenth century. It was designed to hold betel, a mild stimulant chewed throughout tropical Asia and traditionally made from areca nuts and lime wrapped in a betel leaf. The container is in the form of a mythical bird known as a "karaweik". This has been an important motif in Burmese art since the seventh century, and was believed to possess the ideal qualities of purity and gentleness. It is chicken like in its appearance with its feet, curled wings, pointed beak, wealth of overlapping body feathers, curled wings and upturned tail. The waisted stand is decorated with panels of floral ornament and at each end a leaf-shaped extension with foliage motifs, curved upwards to support the body of the stand.
Although containers in this form are common enough in Myanmar, this particular object is of great historical significance since it formed part of the Burmese regalia used by the last king, Thibaw Min. The regalia was requisitioned by the British as indemnity at the end of the Third Burmese War in 1885 and remained under the custodianship of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1886 until 1964, when they were returned to Myanmar. This container was given to the Museum by the Government and people of Myanmar in recognition of its care of the regalia.

United States naval gunfire support debate

There is an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and independent groups like the "United States Naval Gunfire Support Association" over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided. At the heart of the issue is the role that naval gunfire support—the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century.
Although the debate at large traces its roots back to the end of World War II, the current debate began in 1992 with the retirement of the last active "Iowa"-class battleship, , as a result of the reduced demand for naval artillery, the rise of ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions (such as laser-guided bombs, which can accurately strike and destroy an enemy target with a single strike). The most striking point of the debate in the United States centers on battleships: owing to the longtime maintenance and upkeep that the four completed "Iowa"-class battleships have undergone during their time in the navy's active and mothball fleets, many still view battleships as viable solutions for gunfire support, and these members have questioned if the navy can adequately replace the gunfire support provided by a battleship's main guns with the smaller guns on its current fleet of cruisers and destroyers.
The debate has played out across a wide spectrum of media, including newspapers, magazines, web blogs, and congressional research arms like the Government Accountability Office. Each side has presented different arguments on the best approach to the problem, but most of the participants favor the continuation of the DD(X) program or the reinstatement of the "Iowa"-class battleships to the Naval Vessel Register. The s, the s, and s have entered the debate as options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocate the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire.
Background.
Within a few years of the end of World War II, the United States deactivated all of its remaining battleships and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four "Iowa"-class battleships were not, and on several occasions one or more of these four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four "Iowa"-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four "Iowa"-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as long as they did. The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive power that is lacking in the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.
In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan proposed creating a 600-ship navy as part of the overall defense department build-up to counter the threat of the armed forces of the Soviet Union; both the Soviet Army and Navy had grown in the aftermath of the unification of Vietnam in 1975 and the loss of faith that Americans had in their armed services. As part of this, all four "Iowa"-class battleships were modernized and reactivated. However, when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the 600-ship navy was seen as too costly to maintain, and so the navy made plans to return to its traditional 313-ship fleet. This led to the deactivation of many ships in the navy's fleet, including the four reactivated battleships; all were removed from service between 1990 and 1992. Originally, the navy had struck all four ships and made plans to donate them, however Congress intervened in this plan with the passing of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996. Section 1011 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the "Iowa"-class battleships that had been struck by the navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy Reserve Fleets. The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps' amphibious operations. Both battleships were to be maintained with the reserve fleet until such a time as the navy could certify that it had within its fleet the operational capacity to meet or exceed the gunfire support that both battleships could provide. To comply with this requirement, the navy selected the battleships and for reinstatement to the Naval Vessel Register.
"New Jersey" remained in the mothball fleet until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 passed through the United States Congress 18 October 1998. Section 1011 required the United States Secretary of the Navy to list and maintain and "Wisconsin" on the Naval Vessel Register, while Section 1012 required the Secretary of the Navy to strike "New Jersey" from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not-for-profit entity in accordance with section 7306 of Title 10, United States Code. Section 1012 also required the transferee to locate the battleship in the State of New Jersey. The navy made the switch in January 1999. "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" were finally striken from the Naval Vessel Register in 2006.
Replacing the battleships.
The navy sees the battleships as prohibitively expensive, it is working to persuade Congress to allow it to remove "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" from the Naval Vessel Register by developing extended-range guided munitions and a new ship to fulfill marine corps requirements for naval surface fire support (NSFS).
The navy plan originally called for the extension of the range of the guns on the Flight I guided missile destroyers ( to ) with Extended Range Guided Munitions (ERGMs) that would enable the ships to fire precision guided projectiles about inland. The program was initiated in 1996 with a preliminary cost of US $78.6 million; however, the cost of the program increased 400% during its research and development phase. The results of the program had been similarly disappointing: the original expected operational capability date was pushed from 2001 to 2011 before being cancelled by the navy in March 2008 for budget-related reasons and an apparent shift by the navy from the ERGM program to the Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition (BTERM) program. These weapons are neither intended nor expected to satisfy the full range of the marine corps requirements.
The result of the latter effort to design and build a replacement ship for the two battleships was the program, also known either as the DD(X) or DDG-1000 (in reference to the hull number assigned to "Zumwalt" ). The DD(X) was to mount a pair of Advanced Gun System turrets capable of firing specially designed Long Range Land Attack Projectiles some inland. Originally, the navy had planned to build a total of 32 of these destroyers, however the increasing cost of the program led the navy to reduce the overall number of destroyers built from 32 to 24. In 2007 the total procurement of "Zumwalt"-class destroyers was further reduced to a total of seven, before being discontinued at a total of two destroyers in July 2008 as a result of the high cost of building each of the two ships. In September 2008 the navy and the House of Representatives reached an agreement which will allow for the construction of a third DD(X) destroyer, bringing the total number of "Zumwalt"-class destroyers to three.
The discontinuation of the class is due in part to concerns that the "Zumwalt" ships may deprive other projects of needed funding, a concern that has been raised by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Congressional Research Service (CRS), and the Government Accountability Office, all of which have issued reports that suggest that total cost of each ship could be as high as $5 billion or more. In addition to the high cost, naval officials discussing the cancellation of the DD(X) program cited the inability of the DD(X) to fire the Standard missile or provide adequate air defense coverage, and a "classified threat" which the navy feels can be better handled by the current "Arleigh Burke"-class destroyers than by the "Zumwalt"-class destroyers. The article also reported that the Marine Corps no longer needs the long-range fire support from the "Zumwalts’" 155 mm Advanced Gun System because such fire support can be provided by Tactical Tomahawk cruise missiles and precision airstrikes.
Striking the "Iowa"-class battleships.
On 17 March 2006, while the ERGM and DD(X) programs were under development, the Secretary of the Navy exercised his authority to strike "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" from the Naval Vessel Register, which cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as museums. The United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps had both certified that battleships would not be needed in any future war, and have thus turned their attention to development and construction of the next generation guided missile destroyers.
However, this move has drawn fire from sources familiar with the subject; among them are dissenting members of the United States Marine Corps. These dissenters argue that battleships are still a viable solution to naval gunfire support, members of the United States Congress who remain "deeply concerned" over the loss of naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided, and a number of independent groups such as the United States' Naval Fire Support Association (USNFSA) whose ranks frequently include former members of the armed service and fans of the battleships. Although the arguments presented from each group differ, they all agree that the United States Navy has not in good faith considered the potential of reactivated battleships for use in the field, a position that is supported by a 1999 Government Accountability Office report regarding the United States Navy's gunfire support program.
In response, the navy has pointed to the cost of reactivating the two "Iowa"-class battleships to their decommissioned capability. The navy estimates costs in excess of $500 million, but this does not include an additional $110 million needed to replenish the gunpowder for the guns because a survey found the powder to be unsafe. In terms of schedule, the Navy's program management office estimates that reactivation would take 20 to 40 months, given the loss of corporate memory and the shipyard industrial base.
Reactivating the battleships would require a wide range of battleship modernization improvements, according to the navy's program management office. At a minimum, these modernization improvements include command and control, communications, computers, and intelligence equipment; environmental protection (including ozone-depleting substances); a plastic-waste processor; pulper/shredder and wastewater alterations; firefighting/fire safety and women-at-sea alterations; a modernized sensor suite (air and surface search radar); and new combat and self-defense systems. The navy's program management office also identified other issues that would strongly discourage the Navy from reactivating and modernizing the battleships. For example, personnel needed to operate the battleships would be extensive, and the skills needed may not be available or easily reconstituted. Other issues include the age and unreliability of the battleships' propulsion systems and the fact that the navy no longer maintains the capability to manufacture their gun system components and ordnance.
Although the navy firmly believes in the capabilities of the DD(X) destroyer program, members of the United States Congress remain skeptical about the efficiency of the new destroyers when compared to the battleships. Partially as a consequence, Congress passed Pub. L. 109-364, the National Defense Authorization Act 2007, requiring the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again. Congress has ordered that the following measures be implemented to ensure that, if need be, "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" can be returned to active duty:
These four conditions closely mirror the original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of 1996 laid out for the maintenance of "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" while they were in the Mothball Fleet.
Alternatives to Naval Gunfire.
During the period of time in which the battleships were out of commission in the United States, several technological updates and breakthroughs enabled naval ships, submarines, and aircraft to compensate for the absence of big guns within the fleet.
Air superiority.
The earliest challenge to naval artillery was the advent of aircraft and armour piercing/incendiary bombs, which could be used against land based targets in support of troop formations ashore. Although in its infancy during and after World War I, some saw the potential for aircraft and sea based air support and envisioned the role it would have in future conflicts. Among the more notable individuals within the United States was Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. Mitchell had served in World War I, where he eventually commanded all U.S. aircraft in the war and was responsible for leading Allied aircraft in support of the ground offensive during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, one of the first coordinated air-ground offensives in history. Mitchell's experience in World War I led him to believe that battleships were out of date, and he became an increasingly vocal proponent of air power.
In 1921, Mitchell first demonstrated to the world that battleships and other gun dependent vessels could be sunk by aircraft loaded with heavy bombs. In one of his most famous demonstrations, Mitchell convinced the Navy to allow bomb loaded aircraft to attack the German dreadnought , a battleship taken as a prize of war by the United States in 1918. Although the Navy had placed strict rules on the bombing exercise, Mitchell and his men violated the rules and attacked the battleship head on, which caused the vessel to sink in a mere 22 minutes. Although downplayed at the time this would have a dramatic effect on U.S. policy, leading to increased research and development for aircraft.
By World War II naval aircraft had evolved to the point where they posed a threat to battleships and other naval vessels that lacked sufficient anti-aircraft defense. During WWII air raids accounted for the loss of warships and merchant vessels of all types, including the battleships , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . These losses were sustained even after the introduction of the "All or Nothing" armor scheme (armor belts intended to protect battleships from guns of an equal or lesser caliber than their own) and the recognition of the role of airpower and the rise of various ship based anti-aircraft guns meant to improve air defense aboard ships. In addition to their role in attacking ships, several aircraft like the P-47 Thunderbolt were employed for close air support for ground based troops in Europe and in the Pacific.
By the time of the Korean War air power had been supplemented by the introduction of the jet engine, which allowed fighter and bomber aircraft to fly faster. As with their World War II predecessors, the newer jet aircraft proved capable of providing close air support for ground based troops, and were instrumental in aiding UN ground forces during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.
The Vietnam War saw the introduction of helicopter gunships which could be employed to support ground based forces, and the experience gained in Vietnam would spawn the creation of several aircraft during and after the war designed specifically to aid ground forces, including the AC-47 Spooky, Fairchild AC-119, Lockheed AC-130, and A-10 Thunderbolt II, all of which are operated by the Air Force, and the F/A-18 Hornet which is operated by the navy. In addition, the army and marine corps operate UH-1 Iroquois, AH-1 Cobra, and AH-64 Apache helicopters for close air support, and these helicopters can be stationed onboard amphibious assault ships to provide provide ship-to-shore air support for ground forces. These aircraft would later prove instrumental in aiding ground forces from the 1980s onwards, and would be involved in the 1991 Gulf War, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Starting after the invasion of Iraq, the air force began arming unmanned drone aircraft to perform strike missions. Originally designed for prolonged surveillance (and ironically to act as spotters for naval artillery), these aircraft typically have greater endurance than manned strike aircraft and some degree of automation to allow them to patrol for activity without requiring the constant attention of a pilot. This permitted the fielding of a less expensive aerial force which could maintain constant surveillance for enemy targets and conduct strikes on any targets encountered.
Missiles.
Towards the end of World War II Germany introduced the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 ballistic missiles in combat against the Allied forces. The missiles arrived too late to alter the course of the war, but after the fall of Nazi Germany the V-1 and V-2 rockets would form the foundations for the space race and for the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction by providing each superpower with Ballistic Missiles and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles that could carry nuclear warheads.
The rise of precision strike munitions in the 1970s and 1980s reduced the need for a massive naval bombardment against an enemy force, as missiles could now be used against such targets to support ground forces and to destroy targets in advance of the arrival of troops. Guided missiles can also fire much further than the guns of any destroyer, cruiser, frigate, or battleship, allowing for strikes deep into the heart of enemy territory without risking the lives of pilots or airplanes. This led to a major shift in naval thinking, and as a result ships became more dependent on missile magazines than on their guns for offensive and defensive capabilities. This was demonstrated in the 1980s, when all four recommissioned battleships were outfitted with missile magazines, and again in the 1991 Gulf War, when both "Missouri" and "Wisconsin" launched missile volleys against targets in Iraq before using their guns against Iraqi targets on the coast. The same conflict saw the first use of submarine-launched cruise missiles when the attack submarine fired Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles into Iraq from the Red Sea.
Currently, the United States is looking into Non-Line-of-Sight Launch Systems, which would fire either Precision Attack Munitions or Loitering Attack Munitions; however the latter program has been cancelled due to rising costs and poor test performance, while the Precision Attack Missile lacks the minimum range to meet the USMC requirement of .
Although ship-fired missiles can provide support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both artillery shells and missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.
Gun support.
Naval gunfire has been used intermittently since the end of the Second World War. By and large, the guns are small caliber guns found on modern frigates, cruisers, destroyers. The reason the "Iowa"-class battleships were maintained and used is because guns were considered more effective.
In the 1960s, following a requirement established by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) for a new gun capable of firing semi-active laser guided projectiles (SAL GP), the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division worked on the Major Caliber Lightweight Gun (MCLWG) program, testing capability of destroyer-sized ships to provide shore bombardment support with the range previously available from decommissioned cruisers. The 8"/55 caliber Mark 71 gun, a single gun version of the 8"/55 Mark 16 caliber gun was mounted aboard the . However after at-sea technical evaluation in 1975 and operational testing that followed through 1976, The Operational Test and Evaluation Force determined inaccuracy made the gun operationally unsuitable. The lightweight 8"/55 was concluded to be no more effective than the 5"/54 with Rocket Assisted Projectiles. Program funding was terminated in 1978.
In the 1980s, such guns were used by US destroyers during the Lebanese Civil War to shell positions for the Multinational Force in Lebanon operating on the ground. Guns were also used by the Royal Navy in the Falklands War to support British forces during the operations to recapture the islands from the Argentinans. For example, the Type 42 destroyer was required to fire at enemy positions on the islands with her 4.5-inch gun. In one engagement she fired 277 high-explosive rounds, although later problems with the gun prevented continual use. Ship-based gunfire was also used during Operation Praying Mantis in 1988 to neutralize Iranian gun emplacements on oil platforms in the Persian Gulf. Although the smaller caliber guns are effective in combat, larger caliber guns can be employed for psychological warfare purposes, and have compelled the surrender of enemy combatants during combat operations due to a sense of overwhelming firepower. One of the most recent examples of this was the bombardment of Iraqi shore defenses by the battleships and in the Persian Gulf War. The shelling proved to be so devastating that when the latter battleship returned to resume shelling the island the enemy troops surrendered to her Pioneer UAV launched to spot for the battleships' guns rather than face another round of heavy naval artillery support.
The navy has looked into creating precision guided artillery rounds for use with the current fleet of cruisers and destroyers. The most recent attempt to modify the guns for longer range came with the Advanced Gun System mounts that were to be installed aboard the "Zumwalt"-class destroyers, although the navy has been involved in the Long Range Land Attack Projectile and Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition projects for over 10 years in an effort to develop Extended Range Guided Munitions.
In addition to funding research into various extended range munitions, the navy is also working on developing railguns for use with the fleet at some point in the future. The United States Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division demonstrated an 8 MJ rail gun firing 3.2 kilogram (slightly more than 7 pounds) projectiles in October 2006 as a prototype of a 64 MJ weapon to be deployed aboard navy warships. The main problem the navy has had with implementing a railgun cannon system is that the guns wear out due to the immense heat produced by firing. Such weapons are expected to be powerful enough to do a little more damage than a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile at a fraction of the projectile cost. Since then, BAE Systems has delivered a 32 MJ prototype to the Navy. On January 31, 2008, the US Navy tested a magnetic railgun; it fired a shell at 2520 m/s using 10.64 megajoules of energy. Its expected performance is over 5800 m/s muzzle velocity, accurate enough to hit a 5 meter target from away while shooting at 10 shots per minute. It is expected to be ready between 2020 and 2025.
Apart from railguns, 16 inch scramjet rounds with ranges of up to 400 nautical miles that have a 9-minute time of flight are being proposed by Pratt and Whitney working with Dr. Dennis Reilly, a plasma physicist with extensive experience with munitions. Alliant Techniques is also developing a ram-jet projectile for 5-inch and 155mm gun. Unfortunately, the navy had no interested sponsor according to both Pratt and Whitney representatives and Dr. Reilly.
Recent developments.
Prior to the reduction of ships in the DD(X) destroyer program, it seemed unlikely that the above four conditions would have impeded the current plan to turn "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" into museum ships because the navy had expected a sufficient number of DD(X) destroyers to be ready to help fill the NSFS gap by 2018 at the earliest; however, the July 2008 decision by the navy to cancel the DD(X) program would leave the navy without a ship class capable of replacing the two battleships removed from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. Although unlikely, the cancellation of the DD(X) destroyer program may result in a reinstatement of "Iowa" and "Wisconsin" to the Naval Vessel Register; by law, the navy is required to maintain two battleships on the register until the navy certifies that it has within its fleet the operation NSFS capability that can meet or exceed the amount provided by the battleships, and with the Extended Range Guided Munitions program already cancelled in March 2008 and DD(X) destroyer program essentially cancelled in July 2008 the navy does not appear to have met its needed criteria for battleship removal. James T. Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps has said that missiles fired from the Littoral combat ship could fulfill the USMC needs for NSFS. This would not be the current NLOS-LS program as the range of the PAM missile at falls short of the threshold requirement for NSFS of and the number of CLUs the current LCS designs can carry in a ready to fire configuration is also short of the required volume of fire. The Loitering Attack Missile could have matched the required range, but it was cancelled in 2011 and the LCS would still have fallen short in terms of rounds ready to fire.

Thomas was born in 1899 in Ystrad Rhondda, and was educated at Rhondda Grammar School, the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and Jesus College, Oxford. Influenced by the adult education movement, he spent five years as a university tutorial class lecturer before becoming the first warden of Coleg Harlech when it was founded by Dr Thomas Jones in 1927. He remained there until 1940, when he moved to the Ministry of Labour and then the Ministry of Education. Thomas was President of the London Welsh Trust, which runs the London Welsh Centre, Gray's Inn Road, from 1953 until 1955. He was also involved with the work of Unesco, becoming a member of its Executive Board and later chairman (1958–1960). During his time at the Ministry of Education, he worked for improved standards in Welsh schools and for Welsh language tuition (he was a fluent Welsh speaker). He retired from the civil service in 1963, becoming President of the University of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1964 and serving until 1975. He was also Chairman of the Baptist Union of Wales (1966–1967). Apart from his knighthood, he was also awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Wales and an Honorary Fellowship by Jesus College. He died on 26 July 1977 in Bangor, Gwynedd.

J. C. Sulbaran

Juan Carlos Sulbaran (born November 9, 1989 in Willemstad, Curaçao) is a Dutch baseball player who currently plays in the Kansas City Royals organization and the Dutch national team. He throws a changeup, curveball and fastball (which peaks at around 90 mph).
Sulbaran was voted the best pitcher in the 2004 Latin American Youth Baseball Tournament while playing for the Netherlands Antilles. He came to the United States in 2006 to play high school baseball. He missed most of 2007 because of an injury, though he struck out 24 in 12 innings. In 2008, he went 11-0 with a 1.40 ERA, striking out 88 in 67 innings and allowing 31 hits to help his team to a state championship. The Cincinnati Reds chose Sulbaran in the 30th round of the 2008 amateur draft (he was drafted late due to his commitment to the University of Florida) and was signed to a deal with the Reds on August 14, 2008, with a $500,000 signing bonus which was a record for the 30th round. The deal was negotiated between the Reds and Sulbarans father Jorge Sulbaran.
Sulbaran joined the Netherlands Antilles national baseball team for the 2008 Haarlem Baseball Week and got a no-decision against the Cuban national team. He allowed one hit and one run in 7 innings and struck out 6 but walked 7. The only run was a steal of home by Giorvis Duvergel. The performance earned him a spot on the Dutch squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He was the only player on the team who had never appeared for the "Orange" before.
Sulbaran was traded from the Cincinnati Reds to the Kansas City Royals as part of the Jonathan Broxton trade

Local government in Malaysia

The local government or local authority ( or ) is the lowest level in the system of government in Malaysia—after federal and state. It has the power to collect taxes (in the form of assessment tax), to create laws and rules (in the form of by-laws) and to grant licenses and permits for any trade in its area of jurisdiction, in addition to providing basic amenities, collecting and managing waste and garbage as well as planning and developing the area under its jurisdiction. 
Local governments are generally under the exclusive purview of the state governments as provided in the Constitution of Malaysia, except for local governments in the federal territories. The federal Ministry of Housing and Local Government plays a role in coordinating and standardizing the practices of local governments across the country.
Local governments are usually referred to as councils ("majlis"), headed by a civil servant with the title President ("Yang Di-Pertua") for rural districts and municipalities, and Mayor ("Datuk Bandar") for cities, though there are a few exceptions in the form of "special and modified local authorities". Councillors are appointed by the state governments.
Local government areas are distinct from the districts, which are mainly for land administration purposes. In rural areas, the jurisdiction area of local governments largely correspond to the district boundaries. However, in urbanized areas, local government areas may not be consistent with the district boundaries and may overlap with adjoining districts, as municipal or city boundaries usually do not conform to district boundaries.
Historical background.
The government system in Malaysia was a legacy of British colonisation, with many of its laws derived from and modeled on English laws. However, with the passing of times, many local unique social and cultural characteristics have influenced the working of the local governments in Malaysia.
Early development.
The British in 1801 established a "Council of Assessors" in Penang, charged with the role of planning and developing the municipality area, and was the basis of local government in the then Malaya (present-day Peninsula Malaysia). After Penang, local councils were established beginning with Malacca, followed by the Federated and the Unfederated Malay States, finally extending to Sarawak and North Borneo. Laws were promulgated to govern the establishment of local authorities and the organisation of local council elections. One of the important laws was the Local Government Election Ordinance 1950 that entrusted local councils to organise elections for the office of councillors—people that "govern" local areas. Another law was the Local Government Ordinance 1952 which empowered local residents to establish local councils in their area wherever necessary. Prior to Malaya's independence from the British in 1957, there was a total of 289 units of local council in Malaya. The constitution of the new country after independence from Britain gave the power to control local governments to the states.
The 1960s was a challenging time for local authorities in Malaya. They faced many problems regarding internal politics and administration. In addition, the Indonesian confrontation against the formation of Malaysia in 1963 has forced the federal government to suspend local council elections in 1965. The suspension was made by means of emergency law namely the Emergency (Suspension of Local Government Elections) Regulations 1965 and its amendment on the same year. Since then, local governments in Malaysia have not been elected.
Royal Commission of Inquiry 1965.
Problems faced during the early 1960s were further aggravated by a plethora of local government entities in the country at that time. To make matters worse, there were many laws governing local authorities since every state had their own laws. Until early 1970s, the proliferation of local councils reached staggering numbers—374 in Peninsula Malaysia alone. Hence, the federal government saw the need to reform local governments in Malaysia in order to improve its working and standing. A Royal Commission of Inquiry to investigate the working of local governments in West Malaysia was established in June 1965 for this purpose. The commission was headed by Senator Athi Nahappan while its members were D. S. Ramanathan, Awang Hassan, Chan Keong Hon, Tan Peng Khoon and Haji Ismail Panjang Aris—all were prominent politicians of the Alliance, the ruling party of the country. The commission organised many meetings and discussions as well as received many memoranda from various organisations and managed to finish a complete investigation four years later. The commission sent its report to the federal cabinet in December 1969 but its report was only released to the public two years later.
Restructuring.
Although not all of its recommendation were followed by the cabinet, some of its finding became the basis for the restructuring exercise in the next two years. Ong Kee Hui, the Minister for Housing and Local Government at that time through a cabinet committee started the restructuring process by introducing the Local Government Act (Temporary Provision) 1973. This Act empowered the federal government to review all existing laws relating to local governments, including state enactments and ordinances. Eventually, three main laws were passed which changed the system of local government in Malaysia. They were Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974 (Act 133), Local Government Act 1976 (Act 171) and Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act 172).
Some important changes were enforced under the Act 171 alone. One of them was, the restriction of the number of local governments in the peninsula. More importantly the abolishment of local government elections. Under this act, local councillors were no longer elected but appointed by the state government. The local government roles have had rapidly changed as well. In early 1960s, a local government was considered as another channel in exercising one's democratic right - apart from electing representatives to the parliamentary and state assemblies. However, it has now taken up the role of speeding up and encouraging development projects for better economic environment.
Ministry of Housing and Local Government.
The Constitution of Malaysia provides that matters relating to local government is within the administration of the respective state governments. However the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, which is a federal ministry, is given the task to coordinate the local governments in respect of legal and policy standardisation as well as coordinating the channeling of funds from the federal government.
Laws governing local authorities in Malaysia.
Provision in the Constitution of Malaysia.
The constitution of 1957 gave the exclusive power to govern local governments to the state except those in the federal territories. However, a constitutional amendment was made in 1960 that provides for the establishment of a consultative committee called the National Council for Local Government. Membership of this council consist of a federal cabinet minister as the chair, a representative from each state governments as well as no more than 10 representatives of the federal government. Although its role is to be consulted in the matters of law governing local authorities, this 1960 constitutional amendment also provided the chair a casting vote thus gave the federal government a big clout on local government.
Acts of Parliament.
Constitutional provision aside, there are many laws passed by the parliament to control the operation of local government in Malaysia. The most overreaching piece of law is the Local Government Act 1976 (Act 171). This act of parliament outlines the form, organisational structure, functions and responsibilities of a local authority. At the same time, the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act 172) was promulgated to overcome the weaknesses in the planning of land use in local area. This Act 172 puts the primary physical planning responsibility at local level to the local government. Additionally, the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974 (Act 133) explains several other role of local authority regarding drainage, maintenance of municipal roads as well as public buildings. In addition to the three main laws, several other laws and regulations including by-laws were created and enforced to help the running of local government.
Sabah and Sarawak.
Article 95D of the Malaysian Constitution however bars the Parliament to create laws pertaining land and local government for the states of Sabah and Sarawak. Furthermore, article 95E excludes the states from following laws formulated by the National Council for Local Government. However, both state governments still send their representative to the consultative meetings of the committee as observer without any voting rights.
In Sabah, the local authorities were established through provisions under the Local Government Ordinance 1961. This ordinance also outlines the responsibility and function of local councils in Sabah. A state ministry, the Ministry of Local Government and Housing, created for the first time after the state election in 1963, governs the operation of local authorities in the state.
In Sarawak, local authorities were established under the Local Authority Ordinance 1996. This ordinance is the successor of pre-independence law, the Local Government Ordinance 1948. Other laws regulating the running of local authorities in Sarawak include Building Ordinance 1994, Protection of Public Health Ordinance 1999 as well as by-laws formulated under this main laws. Meanwhile, the local authorities in Kuching area were established under the provision of Kuching Municipal Ordinance 1988 and City of Kuching North Ordinance 1988. Under these ordinances, there are currently three local authorities in Kuching area, namely Kuching North City Hall, Kuching South City Council and Padawan Municipal Council. The latter two however were later governed under the Local Authority Ordinance 1996. The state Ministry of Environment and Public Health is responsible for overseeing the running of local councils in the state.
Types of local government.
The enforcement of Local Government Act 1976 established in essence only two types of local councils - one for municipality and one for rural area. However, a city status can be conferred to a municipal council by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong with the consent of the Conference of Rulers once it reached the necessary criteria. Apart from that mentioned by the Act 171, there are many other agencies established and charged with the role of a local council. These so-called modified local authorities were established under newly created, separate and special Act of Parliament or state enactments or ordinances. 
There are currently four type of local governments in Malaysia:
Currently there are a total of 151 local authorities in Malaysia and their breakdown are as follows:
Prior to the 1973 restructuring exercise, there were 6 types of local governments. The total number of local councils in Malaysia then was 418. The types were:
Status criteria.
Among the basic criteria for granting City status on a local government is that it has a minimum population of 500,000 and an annual income of not less than RM 100 million. For a municipal status, the minimum population is 150,000 with an annual income of not less than RM 20 million. These are the latest criteria approved during the State Council Meeting for Local Government in June 2008.
The previous criteria is a minimum of 100,000 residents and minimum annual income of RM 20 million for City and a minimum of 100,000 residents and minimum annual income of RM 5 million for Municipality.

<doc id="18741139" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18741139" title="RISE Editor">
RISE Editor

The RISE Editor is a free information modeling tool for information system development based on model driven development. Functionality includes automatic interface composition, database generation and updates, data insertion, programming interface publishing and web service generation. The modeling takes place in Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD). The layout for these diagrams can be changed to Relational Database or Unified Modeling Language (UML), the functionality stays the same though.
Philosophy of RISE.
The purpose of RISE is to make information system engineering a more manageable process. Technically speaking, RISE is a model-driven engineering (MDE) tool with semantics and functionality that is specialized for the application-domain of information systems. The model in RISE is more than an information model, it's an information model complete with the methods needed to govern the use of the information in the model. Such a model is referred to as a MIM, or managed information model. Using code generators a managed information model is automatically transformed into a system. All in all, this is what's commonly referred to as a model-driven architecture.
A domain is a suitable candidate for model-driven engineering if different solutions for the domain show noticeable similarities. A good MDE tool is one that focuses on and addresses these similarities whereas a bad MDE tool is one that diverts attentions from the problem domain. The domain of RISE, information systems in the sense of database-centric systems managing business information, is an obvious candidate for MDE. Below are some examples on how RISE boosts efficiency and simplicity in the engineering process simply by adhering to the specifics of the domain.
The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle states that "every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". In essence, unnecessary duplication of information - such as business logics, rules, configuration, etc. - decreases clarity and predictability of a system. Redundancy always poses a risk of causing inconsistencies and contradictions. This said, DRY is actually one of those principles that all skilled developers adhere to even though some might be unfamiliar with the term itself.
RISE can be envisioned as a modeling tool implementing the DRY principle for information system engineering. For sure, in a RISE model everything has a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation. But it doesn't stop there, RISE unleashes the positive effects of not repeating oneself: guaranteed consistency and automated changes. When an authoritative information source is changed in your model, RISE automatically cascades that change throughout the model, updating anything and everything that depends on the source.
This combination of a theoretically sound foundation and simple pragmatism together with its being freeware is probably the reason for its increased popularity in higher education within the domains of system development and information modeling. It is today used at e.g. Bundeswehr University Munich, Universität Zürich, and Università di Bologna.
Code Generation.
The RISE suit provides a range of code generators for transforming RISE models into software. A RISE code generator is a separate software application that operates on a RISE model (XML file) and produces some kind of output. There are two main categories of code generators: database script generators and application source code generators.
RISE code generators can be launched in several different ways:
Database script generators
The database code generators write incremental scripts for creating, and updating, relational database models based on the RISE model. A RISE model contains - unless it's been refactored - the entire life-cycle of the data model. The code generator translates this life-cycle into an incremental database specific script. Currently, code generators for SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL are available.
Application source code generators
The application source code generators render code, in a particular programming language, for working with databases based on the same RISE model. The generated code includes classes for managing database access and for publishing the access layer as web services. Both SOAP and JSON style web services are supported. Currently, two languages are supported C# (.NET) and PHP. The C# for ODBC code generator outputs code handling three databases (SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL). For PHP there are two different code generators, PHP for MySQL and PHP for PostgreSQL, creating source code using the respective database native driver. 
There is also an AJAX code generator for RISE. It renders JavaScript source code, that uses jQuery, for accessing JSON enabled web services in Rich Internet Applications or AJAX applications. The generated code is compliant with any JSON enabled web service, .NET as well as PHP, generated from the same RISE model.
Major features.
"1) The utility tool and import functionality works with most ODBC compliant databases. Note, this includes databases for which there are, currently, no code generators."

Roman Catholic Diocese of Boac

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Boac (Lat: "Dioecesis Boacensis") is a Roman Rite diocese of the Latin Church of the Catholic Church in the Philippines. It has jurisdiction over the province of Marinduque.
History.
Created suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lipa, separating from the Mother Diocese of Lucena on 2 April 1977, the Diocese of Boac comprises the whole civil province of Marinduque. It has a total area of 959.2 km2. In his book, “Historico Religioso Estado Geografico,” 1865, Fr. Felix de Huerta says that the first apostle to Marinduque was the Franciscan Missionary Fray Estevan Cruz, who planted the first cross in 1579 that paved the way for the evangelization of the people. The first “visita” was established in 1580 and it was called “Monserrat de Marinduque” (now Boac) with Fray Alonzo Banol as its minister. In 1609 two other “visitas” were instituted, “San Juan de Marinduque” (now Sta. Cruz) and San Bernardo de Marinduque (now Gasan) with Fray Pedro de Talavera and Fray Juan Rosado as their first pastors, respectively. Later on, the Franciscans ceded the administration of the island to the Archbishop of Manila in 1613.
The Jesuits in the Philippines 1581-1768, a book written by Fr. Horacio de la Costa, states that Archbishop Miguel Garcia Serrano of Manila entrusted the island of Marinduque to the care of the Society of Jesus in 1621. The Jesuits stayed in the province and founded the town of Boac on 8 December 1622 and later on the towns of Sta. Cruz and Gasan. By virtue of a Spanish Royal Decree dated 19 May 1864, the Augusti-nian Recollect Fathers took over the spiritual administration of Boac in exchanged for the Curacies they left behind to the hands of the Jesuit missionaries in Mindanao.
Before the creation of the Diocese of Lipa by St. Pius X, the island of Marinduque, since 14 August 1595 till 10 April 1910, belonged to Archdiocese of Manila. When the Diocese of Lucena was created on 20 August 1950, Marinduque became a part of her. In 2 April 1977, by virtue of the Apostolic Bull “Cum Tempore Maturare” issued by Pope Paul VI, Marinduque was created as an independent Diocese. It was called Diocese of Boac.
On 10 May 1978, carried by the effect of the Papal Bull, the Diocese of Boac was canonically erected according to the Decretum Executorium signed by Most. Rev. Bruno Torpigliani, the Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines. Most Rev. Rafael M. Lim, the former Bishop of Laoag since 1971 and a native of Boac, was appointed on 26 January 1978 by Paul VI as the first Bishop of the new Diocese.
Boac is a poor Diocese in the island province of Marinduque. Its geographical location contributes greatly to this situation driving Marinduquenos (the inhabitants of the island) to seek for greener pasture outside of its provincial confine. Seeking excellence through God given talents, some have defied poverty by going out of the island and engaging into a multi-faceted business world. Many have succeeded; others have worked hard and achieved the prestige of national positions in government offices; while the majority has remained in the island-province contented with the kind of life they had since birth. Marinduquenos are peace-loving, simple, religious and hardworking. 
Through the loving guidance of the Most Rev. Rafael M. Lim, the first bishop of the diocese, a diocesan vision is made in 1981: Marinduque, Simbahan ng mga Dukha na may Katarungan, Pag-big at Kapayapaan. Through a concerted effort of the faith community and upon the leadership of the Clergy, the local Church of Marinduque tried to realize this dream for the diocese. Programs and activities were focused towards this vision. Many of them have succeeded and have been continuously implemented within the diocese. In one of the monthly recollections in 1998, the members of the Clergy affirmed that the Diocese is a Church that is materially poor but with a deep grasp and sense of the Lord. Poverty exists because of sinful structures and those who are socially poor are marginalized. The diocese aims towards a participatory Church where both poor and rich people share each other’s time, talent and treasure; where harmonious relationship exists between them thereby giving witness to the spirit of pastoral charity. As the Church denounces the sinful causes and structures of poverty, she at the same time designs programs and plans to alleviate the condition of the poor and inspires her ministers to the real witnessing of the spirit of poverty. 
Although the Diocese is materially poor, giving and sharing have a great place in the minds, hearts, and practices of the people. There is a remarkable atmosphere of sensitivity, cooperation and responsibility towards one’s neighbors and to the Church’s programs and activities. Poverty has become an occasion for sensitivity among the people of God in the Local Church of Marinduque. On 10 September 1998, Most Rev. Rafael M. Lim, the first Bishop of the diocese passed away. Concerted efforts of the members of the Clergy and the collaboration of the faith community towards achieving a diocesan vision have not been hampered by his death. Through an unending support of the successors of Bishop Lim, the diocese edged towards achieving its vision. Their dedication and zealousness have paved and cemented the areas of concerns for the benefit of the people of Marinduque especially in their faith and belief in God. 
On 10 May 2003, the Silver Anniversary Foundation of the Diocese of Boac was celebrated. Prompted by the creative thinking and pastoral concern of the new Bishop Jose F. Oliveros, the First Diocesan Synod was held on 4–9 May 2003 whose objectives include: to thank God for all the graces the Diocese received from Him for the past years; to assess and evaluate the life of faith and pastoral activities in the past up to the present; and to plan for the better future of the Diocese. This ecclesial activity is based on the admonition of Pope John Paul II in his Apostolic Letter entitled Tertio Millennio Ineunte which says that: “We do all these things in order to discover and reflect on the face of Christ. Because our witnessing would be nothing if we would not discover and reflect the face of God.” Synodal decrees came out after a weeklong deliberation and reflection of the appointed delegates from the fourteen parishes of the diocese. Participated also by government and civil servants and together with the different sectoral leaders from the local communities, the progress of the Synod edged slowly towards its historic culmination wherein decrees based on the diocesan vision: Marinduque Simbahan ng mga Dukha na may Katarungan, Pag-ibig at Kapayapaan were finally voted and ratified. In her journey towards a new way of life as a church, after the advent of the Diocesan Synod 2003, the local church of Marinduque is once again sent by Christ: “Duc in altum, ecclesia pauperum, in iustitia, in caritate et in pace.” This is a new call that demands a new response and sharing in the mission of Christ. As a Diocese, she cannot accomplish all the necessary changes expected of her as a people of God, all by herself. There will be no significant implementations of all the Synodal Decrees towards the realization of her vision: “Marinduque, church of the poor with justice, love and peace”, without the much needed support and cooperation of all the faithful to this new endeavor. 
After the Synodal Decrees were solemnly voted by the delegates at the Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Boac and canonically ratified by the Local Ordinary of the Diocese, much remained for their eventual implementation. This has become the main task handed over to the new Bishop-elect Most Rev. Reynaldo G. Evangelista by the former Bishop Oliveros who was transferred to shepherd the Diocese of Malolos in 5 August 2004. Having in mind the value of the Sy-
nodal Decrees, Bishop Evangelista expressed his desire to continue with the existing programs and activities in the diocese. Equipped with pastoral experiences and engaged in the formation of seminarians in the Archdiocese of Lipa before becoming a Bishop of Boac, Bishop Evangelista called for a Pastoral Assembly in September 2006 to look into the Decrees and its implementation in the diocese. A Diocesan Pastoral Plan was unanimously approved based on the Synodal Decrees.
Positive outlook of the future is heightening based on the optimism of the people of Marinduque since the First Diocesan Synod in 2003. The positive gestures of the Bishop and the entire Clergy are encouraging and thus ushering in great hope for a brighter future of the Church in Marinduque. God is so good to the Diocese through the witnessing of the priests and the Bishop of Boac. The Diocese of Boac aspires to become a witnessing community of the Church of the Poor where justice, love and peace reign.

After the death of Meri (Thai: เมรี) and Rodhasen (Thai: รถเสน), their spirits flew away to the Next life. Many years later,
Rodhasen reincarnated as a young prince called Phra Suthon. (Thai: พระสุธน) One day, Phra Suthon was visited by Phran Boon (Thai: พรานบุญ). Phran Boon presented him with a young beautiful girl called Manohra (Thai: มโนห์รา). Manohra was a magical bird-human whom Phran Boon caught during his hunting in the deep forest. She was the reincarnation of Meri. Phra Suthon and Manohra got married and lived a happy life but things changed when a lord of a kings' court was jealous of Phra Suthon. He tricked Phra Suthon into leaving the Kingdom and lied to the King that Manohra brought bad luck to the Kingdom. He told the king that the only way to chase away the bad luck was to burn Manohra alive. Manohra survived by asking the King for her wings, so that she could dance in his presence before she died and when she got her wings back, she flew away to Khao Krailas (Thai: เขาไกรลาส), her home where she was the youngest daughter of the ruler. When Phra Suthon came back to the Kingdom, he was very sad and was determined that he had to bring Manohra back. Phra Suthon journeyed in the forest for 7 years 7 months and 7 days, faced several challenges and fought a lot of monsters before he arrived in Khao Krailas where the last challenge awaited for him. Phra Suthon had to identify Manohra from her six sisters who had been charmed to look exactly like Manohra. Phra Suthon identified the right Manhora with the help of God Indra who disguised as a golden fly and flew above Manohra's head. After that, Phra Suthon brought Manohra back to his Kingdom and they lived happily till the end of their days.

Edward Hawarden

Edward Hawarden (Harden) (9 April 1662 – 23 April 1735) was an English Roman Catholic theologian and controversialist.
Life.
Hawarden was born in Lancashire, England. His family were recusants who maintained domestic chapels in their residences in Appleton and Widnes. Edward, after a course at the English College, Douai, remained there as a classical tutor, and after his ordination (7 June 1686), as professor of philosophy. 
In 1688, having taken the bachelor's degree at the University of Douai, he spent two months as tutor of divinity at Magdalen College, Oxford, which James II of England purposed making a seat of Catholic education. The impending revolution against James forced him to return to Douai, where he soon proceeded D.D. and was installed in the chair of divinity. In 1702 he was persuaded to take part in the concurrence for one of the royal chair of divinity in the university, but the influence of a hostile minority secured the installation of another candidate by mandatory letters from the court. Shortly afterwards complaints were lodged at Rome that the Douai professors, Dr. Hawarden in particular, were propagating the errors of Jansenism, but official investigation completely exonerated all.
In 1707 Hawarden left Douai to take charge of the mission of Gilligate, Durham, and later Aldcliffe Hall, near Lancaster. Brief entries in the Tyldesley Diary give an idea of his daily life until the seizure of Aldcliffe Hall in 1717, after which he moved to London, probably on his appointment as controversy-writer. 
Dr. Hawarden received the thanks of the University of Oxford for his defence of the Blessed Trinity in the famous conference with Dr. Samuel Clarke (1719). He died, aged 73, in London.
Works.
Among his works are: 
a collective edition of his works was published at Dublin in 1808.

History of the Cathedral Church.
Augustinian Recollect Cathedrals and Churches in Luzon
Cathedral of Saint Joseph, Alaminos City, Pangasinan. In the past the Alaminos City had various names (San Jose de Soyang, San Jose de Casborran, Sarapsap) and underwent several transfers and locations except, for a gap of half a century, the Recollects stayed at Alaminos since its foundation in 1610 until the Philippine Revolution of 1896. A great fire reduced the town into ashes and it was thereafter renamed Sarapsap. The actual name was taken after Governor General Juan de Alaminos who visited it in 1872.
Among other edifices constructed by Recollects is the majestic cathedral dedicated to Saint Joseph. Father Manuel Bosquete who was at the helm of the San Jose de Casborran mission from 1838-1849 started the construction of the divine temple. His successor Father Jose Tornos, who was proficient in Pangasinense, inaugurated it in 1857. This Recollect minister who tool over the parochial administration in 1849 remained in Alaminos for almost thirty years and endowed the church with the best ornaments. Father Tornos died in 1878 and was buried in the future cathedral. At the church pavement one can view his tombstone in Spanish.
Father Patricio Marcellan writes in 1879: "The present church and parochial house are made of brick manufactured in the same town. The first oven for brick-making making was built under the supervision of Father Manuel Bosquete, the first Recollect parish priest of this town , and the edifices are the tallest and most spacious in the province, which draws naturally any visitor's attention." The church still attracts attention up to this day, already as a cathedral since it’s the erection of Alaminos Diocese in 1985. Alaminos is not a big city in terms of population, with about 75,000 inhabitants only. But the faithful can do boast of the structure of their cathedral-spacious, majestic and well-proportioned- and equally stable belfry made of bricks.

Sack-back gown

__NOTOC__
The sack-back gown or robe à la française was a women's fashion of the 18th century. At the beginning of the century, the sack-back gown was a very informal style of dress. At its most informal, it was unfitted both front and back and called a sacque, contouche, or robe battante. By the 1770s the sack-back gown was second only to court dress in its formality. This style of gown had fabric at the back arranged in box pleats which fell loose from the shoulder to the floor with a slight train. In front, the gown was open, showing off a decorative stomacher and petticoat. It would have been worn with a wide square hoop or panniers under the petticoat. Scalloped ruffles often trimmed elbow-length sleeves, which were worn with separate frills called engageantes.
The loose box pleats which are a feature of this style are sometimes called Watteau pleats from their appearance in the paintings of Antoine Watteau. The various Watteau terms, such as "Watteau pleat", "Watteau back", "Watteau gown" etc., date from the mid-19th century rather than reflecting authentic 18th century terminology, and normally describe 19th and 20th century revivals of the sack-back.
Notable wearers.
A popular story, traced back to the correspondence of Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, Duchess d'Orléans, is that the earliest form of the sack-back gown, the "robe battante", was invented as maternity clothing in the 1670s by Louis XIV's mistress to conceal her clandestine pregnancies. However people would comment: "Madame de Montespan has put on her "robe battante", therefore she must be pregnant.". A similar story is associated with Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans, Duchess of Berry, who during the French Regency of 1715-1723 was known for wearing this style of gown which showcased her bosom and face whilst, as with Madame de Montespan, disguising illicit pregnancies.

<doc id="18741329" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18741329" title="Ammaveedu">
Ammaveedu

Ammaveedus were the residences of the consorts of the Maharajahs of Travancore in Trivandrum. The descendants of the Maharajahs were considered as members of these Ammaveedus, with a status subordinate only to royalty. The chief four Ammaveedus are the Arumana, Vadasseri, Thiruvattar and Nagercoil Ammaveedus.
Origin.
The consorts of the Travancore kings were known generally as "Ammachis" and held the title of Panapillai Amma which meant royal consort. As per the Marumakkathayam law of inheritance and succession in the Royal family of Travancore the Maharajahs were succeeded by their nephews from their sisters, the Maharanis. The Panapillai Amma was granted privileges as befitting their status, vast areas of lands and other valuable property and "a liberal provision is made from the State funds for their maintenance in comfort and dignity". The Ammachi was not a member of the royal household, and was in no way associated with the royal court and could not, earlier, even be seen in public with the ruler whose wife she was. Ammachis, if put away or widowed, were not allowed to marry any other man and were restricted and guarded in their own residences. The male and female children born to the Maharajah were dignified with the honorific of Thampi and Kochamma/Thankachi respectively.
Etymology.
The Maharajah's spouse was known as the Panapillai Amma Kochamma or Ammachi, and her "veedu" or residence was known as an Ammaveedu. The names of the Ammaveedus corresponded to the place from where the consort hailed. For example, the Arumana Ammaveedu had its origin when a lady from Arumana village in Vilavancode, Kanyakumari was espoused by a former Maharajah of Travancore. Other Ammaveedus of prominence were Vadasseri Ammaveedu, Nagercoil Ammaveedu, Thanjavur Ammaveedu, Thiruvattar Ammaveedu, Puthumana Ammaveedu (of Ravi Varman Thampi) etc., all named after the villages from where the original Ammachis came.
The Ammaveedus.
There are several Ammaveedus in Trivandrum such as the Puthumana, Kallada, Mupidakka, Chavara, Pulimoodu Ammaveedus' etc. However from the end of the 18th century four Ammaveedus gained prominence. These were the Arumana, Vadasseri, Thiruvattar and Nagercoil Ammaveedus. Maharajah Karthika Thirunal Dharma Raja had married four ladies from the above mentioned villages and established these Ammaveedus. Thereafter he decreed that henceforward the Maharajahs and male members of the Travancore Royal Family were to take consorts only from these four families and if an outsider was to be taken, she would have to be adopted into one of these. Balarama Varma, his successor, married from the Arumana family as did Visakham Thirunal in 1859. Swathi Thirunal and Uthram Thirunal married sisters who were adopted into the Thiruvattar family. Ayilyam Thirunal's consort was similarly adopted into the Nagercoil family. Moolam Thirunal married from Nagercoil first and following his consort's death married a commoner by adopting her into the Vadasseri Ammaveedu.
Only those consorts of the Maharajahs who were born or adopted into one of these four Ammaveedus was entitled to the royal dignities and privileges that came with the title of Panapillai Amma. As late as the early 20th century when the then heir apparent, Prince Chatayam Thirunal, married a lady from outside these four families, she was not permitted to adopt the above mentioned title and separate provisions had to be made later on the Prince's application from the state treasury.

Her father went to the heavens to receive his punishment for falling in love with a dragon. Her mother returned to her underwater kingdom to live as a nun to atone for the sins of loving a god and having his child. She would pray to the gods to not punish her daughter for their mistakes. While Uttai Tawee was still inside the egg, her mother gave her to a group of forest creatures to raise. The forest creatures consist of a male snake, a female parrot, and a male turtle. The animals swore to raise Uttai Tawee and love her to repay her parents back for saving their lives from a forest fire and for giving them the abilities to speak and turn into humans. The dragon princess also left a magic ring, in the shape of a dragon, to her daughter for protection. Before Uttai Tawee could hatch she was swallowed by a large frog. The frog died from the protective poison her mother had placed on the shell of the egg. The animals return to her nest to find the missing egg and the dead frog nearby and argued about what had happened to the egg. Uttai Tawee emerged from the frog in a child form to end their argument. As a child Uttai Tawee grew up in the forest without knowing who her mother was. Her father visited her once to teach her how to control her magical powers, but couldn't stay with her long, since he still had to endure his punishment. Uttai Tawee hid herself in a frog skin to allow herself to freely roam around the forest. She found a small village near the forest and yearns to play with children her age. Some of the children would play with her, while others shunned her for being a stranger and not knowing who her parents were. Their rejection sadden her. 
One day, while Uttai Tawee was in her frog skin, she was captured by an poor old man for dinner. He took her home to fed himself and his wife. They were going to cook her but was interrupted when she started speaking and by a group of men outside. The old man was an addicted gambler and owed them money, which he couldn't pay. Feeling sorry for the couple, Uttai Tawee old them where to find jewels buried underground to pay for the debts. She made the old man swear that he would quit gambling. She would cook for them and lie about how the food got there. The couple adored her and decided to keep her as a pet. One day, they found her in human form and realized that she was not a frog, but a small child. They were going to destroy the frog skin so she could remain human with them. She caught them and asked them why they are doing that. The couple explained to her that she shouldn't have to wear a frog's skin if she was such a beautiful child. She told them that she wanted to keep the frog's skin, but will remain in human form if they wanted her too. From then on they looked after her as their granddaughter. Uttai Tawee lived with the old couple and visit her forest friends.
Uttai Tawee grew up to be the most beautiful girl in the kingdom, and all of the men fell in love with her. A young prince who passed by her village saw her and they fell in love. They were not allowed to marry because Uttai Tawee was only a poor commoner, while the prince was a wealthy nobleman. The prince's mother disliked Uttai Tawee, since she had already promised that the prince wold marry the daughter of a friend of hers, an evil princess from another kingdom. The queen set Uttai Tawee the task of building a house of gold, and the prince was tasked with building a bridge of gold, before they might marry. Uttai Tawee used her magic to make the golden house in seconds. While the prince constructed workers to built the bridge. The evil princess and her men destroyed every bridge the prince built because she was angry that he had rejected her for a commoner. Uttai Tawee and the prince prayed to the gods and asked them for help. If they were soul mates, please allow the bridge to be complete and it did. Finally Uttai Tawee and the prince married and lived very happily. The jealous princess would travel to the prince's kingdom to rob and terrorize his people. Everyone knew that the bandits were from her kingdom but couldn't do anything about it as there was no proof that it was them. The prince had to decide to go to the evil princess's kingdom to ask her to spear his people of her attacks. This left Uttai Tawee alone with his parents, who by now accepted her as their daughter-in-law. Before they parted the prince had like size statues of them made. He took the her statue with him while she kept his.
When the prince arrived the evil princess tried to make him fall in love with her, but he ignores her. Having enough the princess put a love spell on him so that he would be her love slave and stay with her. The princess sends her older brother to kill Uttai Tawee so no one would get between her and the prince. She and her minion showed her brother how Uttai Tawee looked like and the evil prince fell madly in love with her. He changed his plans and tried to seduce Uttai Tawee instead. Uttai Tawee was sad when she found out that her husband fell in love with another woman and married her. She doesn't like the evil prince but remains kind and respectful to him as he is a guest. When she discovered the evil princess' plans, Uttai made a statue of herself and placed it in the Prince's room. When the jealous princess saw it, she tried to melt it, but the statue came to life and fought her off. The jealous princess tried to drown it in the river but good overcame evil and the prince was freed of his spell. He returned to Uttai Tawee but the jealous princess sent Krok, the powerful enemy of Uttai's parents. With the help of her grandfather the king dragon, her animal friends, and her father the tree god, Uttai vanquished Krok along with the jealous princess and her brother. The jealous princess's parents were sorry for their daughter's misdeeds and returned to their kingdom. The lakorn ends with Uttai Tawee and her prince living happily together.

St.Thomas Dayara, Vettikkal

St. Thomas Dayara is a monastery of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church situated in Vettikkal, about five kilometres from Mulanthuruthy in Kerala.
History.
In the year 1125, on the first Sunday after Easter, a cross brought from St. Thomas Church, Mulanthuruthy was erected at 
Vettikkal, which was the then border point between the Royal Provinces of Kochi and Travancore, in the name of India's Apostle and our Guardian Saint Blessed St. Thomas.
This ancient Holy Cross is still honorably retained on the east side wall of the Dayara building. In the year 1200 it was declared a Chapel.
Kattumangattu Junior Bava Geevarghese Mar Coorilose (second Bishop of Thozhiyoor Church) who died in 1809, is buried in this Dayara. He is considered a saint by the local faithful, who celebrate his feast on 28 and 29 May. Thousands of people irrespective of religious affiliations attend this every year and receive blessings.
In 1877, Parumala Thirumeni and the Malankara Metropolitan, after 40 days of meditation and fasting, consecrated the renovated Dayara and the Holy Madbaha. Soon after the consecration ceremony, the 'first Holy Synod of Malankara Church' was conducted in the Dayara. The Malankara Church was demarcated into seven dioceses in this Synod with Bishops being assigned to each Diocese.
In 1976, Metropolitan Joseph Mar Pakkomios renovated the Dayara. On 10 December 1976, in the centenary year of Parumala Thirumeni's ordination as Metropolitan, the holy relics of Parumala Thirumeni were transferred and interred here.
In 1977, on December 10, a Chapel in the upper floor of the Dayara was consecrated by His Holiness Baselious Marthoma Mathews I, the then Catholicose.

Hai San Secret Society

The Hai San Society () which had its origins in Southern China was a Penang-based Chinese secret society established around 1820 and in 1825 led by Low, Ah Chong and Hoh Akow (also spelt Ho Ah Kow or Hok Ah Keow), its titular head. At that time the society's headquarters was located at Beach Street (Ujong Passir).
History.
Secret societies existed well before the establishment of the Hai San Society and their existence in Penang can be traced back to the founding of Penang (1799). Thomas John Newbold (1807-1850), an officer in the 23 Regiment, Madras Light Infantry, in Malacca (1832-1835) noted:
Bolton et al. suggest that the Hai San society started out mostly Cantonese and pro-Ghee Hin but by around 1854 had absorbed the Wah Sang society and become almost exclusively Hakka and anti-Ghee Hin. They made use of, among other things: 
Larut Wars.
The Hai San society figure prominently in the Larut Wars of 1862-1873 and by that time was headed by Chung Keng Quee. At Larut, miners who were members of the Hai San society fought with miners who were members of the Ghee Hin society over the tin-rich fields of Kelian Pauh and Kelian Baru. The two warring factions also clashed in Selangor.
The Hai San society was allied with the Penang-based Tokong or Tua Peh Kong society, members of whom financed the mining of tin in the Larut area.
The incessant warfare between the Hai San and Ghee Hin brought tin mine production to a standstill. The fighting between the two societies was brought to an end with the signing of a treaty between the two parties in 1874, known as The Chinese Engagement.

Basepoint Centres

Basepoint Business Centres is a United Kingdom company that specialises in the development and operation of flexible business centres. Flexible business centres provide a supportive environment for small and start up companies and under the Basepoint business model supply a range of shared facilities as well as office or workshop space all for a fixed monthly fee. Basepoint is a wholly owned subsidiary of grant-making charity the ACT Foundation.
History.
Basepoint was formed in September 1988 to raise funds from the public to buy residential property to let under the assured tenancies legislation introduced by the Housing Act 1988. In 1993 the company elected to extend its interests into commercial property and in 1995 opened its first managed business centre at Romsey, Hampshire. Further centres in the same region followed at Waterlooville, High Wycombe and Weymouth.
In June 2000 the company joined the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), and thereafter the pace of openings picked up markedly, with new centres opening in Havant in October 2000, Basingstoke in April 2001, and Folkestone, Southampton, Andover and Crawley in 2003. 2004 saw new centres open their doors in Gosport and Bournemouth, while 2005 saw a new centre opened in Swindon and the company won a management contract for a centre in Northfleet, Kent, owned by Kent County Council.
At the end of 2005 Basepoint plc was acquired by major shareholder the ACT Foundation, a grant-making charity with a substantial portfolio of property investments, and the company was split into a development arm, Basepoint Developments Ltd, and the division responsible for the management of the centres, Basepoint Centres Ltd. With the resources of its new parent behind it the company continued its expansion programme until by July 2011 it had 28 centres operational across the south of England and up into the Midlands, and a number of others under development, hosting well over 1,800 small businesses.
Basepoint Business Model.
Premises are let on short-term licences that require as little as two weeks’ notice, and a single fee covers all the premises' costs apart from consumables such as communications and electricity. Customers are typically start-ups making the first move from a spare bedroom or garage into proper business premises, small companies who would prefer to avoid the inflexibility of a long lease, and small organisations that are attracted by the support, high quality communal facilities and sense of community that all Basepoint centres offer.
The company also differentiates itself from serviced office providers in that its on-site managers act as a gateway to a wide range of support and advice, and the company's strategy is to expand this over the next few years by introducing additional support for start-up companies by establishing links with grant-making agencies, suppliers of finance, expert advisors and more.
Basepoint centres are often built in partnership with local or regional government bodies as part of regeneration and employment initiatives, with their abilitity to foster the development of new businesses seen as valuable in areas with below-average growth rates.
Charitable activities.
What makes Basepoint unusual is its charitable activities. As a subsidiary of charity the ACT Foundation ultimately all its profits are used for charitable causes, with its parent committed to 'act to enhance the quality of life for people in need'. Each centre is also tasked to partner with a local charity and contribute money via a £ for £ matched funding programme an annual pre-determined limit.

Petit train d'Artouste

The Petit train d'Artouste is a narrow gauge tourist railway situated in the French Pyrenees close to the Spanish border, some south of the town of Pau, and within the "commune" of Laruns. The line runs high above the headwaters of the Gave d'Ossau, and provides access to the Lac d'Artouste, a semi-artificial lake in the mountains at an altitude of over .
The line was originally constructed for the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer du Midi (CFM), the then main line railway operator in the area to the north of the Pyrenees. As part of a program of electrifying these lines, the CFM constructed a series of hydro-electric power stations in the valley of the Ossau between the years 1920 and 1932. Significant civil engineering works were required in order to provide access to these works, and included the line now used by the petit train. Once this work was finished, the CFM recognised the tourist potential of the line, and the first tourist trains were run.
Today the petit train is reached by a "télécabine" from a lower station at Artouste-Fabrèges, on the Lac de Fabrèges in the valley of the Gave du Brousset. This lower station is at an altitude of and accessible by road. The "télécabine" climbs to an upper station (known as "Ossau2000") at an altitude of , where passengers change to the petit train. After leaving "Ossau2000", the line runs through a tunnel, crossing under the ridge to reach a point high above the valley of the Gave de Soussouéou, another of the Gave d'Ossau's tributaries. From here the line runs along a twisting and vertiginous ledge above that valley until it reaches the dam of the Lac d'Artouste. The culminating point of the railway is approximately 1,940 m.
The line is long and is built to a gauge of . Trains consist of 6 12-seat carriages pulled by a diesel locomotive, and operate from late May or early July until the end of September or early October. They are subject to a maximum speed of and the end to end journey takes just under one hour. On busy days, up to 10 trains are used providing 3 departures per hour, whilst at other times departures are hourly. Trains depart from 08.30 until 14:30 or later in the high season.

Tribiq

Tribiq (pronounced like Tribe-ik) is a UK-based web site design and development company.
Tribiq is the trading name for Tribal Limited (incorporated in England), and was previously called Tribal Internet. The company was founded in 1996 and rebranded in 2008 under the name Tribiq. Tribiq is a registered trademark in the EU and other countries.
The company's activities are web design and development, mostly for customers in the UK and contintental Europe, and web-based application development.
Tribiq also develops the Tribiq CMS open source content management system.
Tribiq CMS.
Tribiq CMS is the company's main product line. It is a browser-based web site content management system, and a platform for custom websites and online applications.
It is available in an open source Community edition under the BSD Licenses. Other editions of Tribiq CMS are also available under a commercial license.
Features.
Tribiq CMS is a browser-based website content management system based on PHP and MySQL.
It allows site administrators to edit many aspects of a website: the content of individual pages can be edited with a WYSIWYG editor; the navigational structure of the site can be modified and developed; "Modules" can be installed to add management and visitor-facing functionality, some of which can render "Plugins" which appear on visitor-facing web pages. Sites can be loaded with new "Skins" which change the appearance of web pages.
Many management features use AJAX interfaces, so that the effect of making a change can be previewed and then published, without needing to reload the web page.
The overall layout of a page is determined by a Template (of which the CMS contains various layouts), and the Skin (which includes CSS and images and which controls the appearance of the page).
There are scalability features; when a Plugin is inserted into a page, the administrator can decide whether to apply the Plugin just to that page, to any page which uses a given Template, or across the entire site.
Tribiq CMS has multi-language capabilities. It is designed to handle content in any character set, and uses UTF-8 format for data storage so that characters in all languages can be rendered faithfully. Various tools are available to assist in the management of multiple languages, such as the "translation chain" system which creates relationships between pages which have the same meaning but are in different languages.
Administrators can use either the admin back-end of the CMS, or the front-end of the site in one of several editing modes. An administrator can perform a range of functions, such as: managing content; organizing the categorization of content; installing new templates and skins; installing and managing Plugins; managing languages and their phrases; managing password-protected content and the associated Users and Groups; and other administrative tasks.
Tribiq CMS can be operated in a multi-site environment, with a single installation of the software being used to run several sites. So-called "Super Administrators" can have a single admin login across all federated sites, while "Local Administrators" can edit only their designated site.
Most of the visible functionality of Tribiq CMS is delivered using Plugins. Many Plugins are built into the standard product, and others can be installed separately. A Plugin which performs a given function can thus be removed and replaced with a different one.
Tribiq CMS can be used as a platform for web-based applications, with the admin back-end being used as an administrative interface which can be extended in custom ways. It can be operated with the admin back-end as the sole interface.
It is designed to have the familiarity of a regular operating system, and the admin back-end has icons, different views, pagination, sort controls, filtering and search features. It has a fully documented API, with the intention that third-party developers can create new application Plugins.
The product is designed to run on any web server with PHP 5 and MySQL 5. When administering a site, it is designed to work on Internet Explorer versions 7 and later, Firefox, Safari and Chrome.
TUIX.
TUIX, Tribiq User Interface XML, is an XML-based user interface markup language created by Tribiq for development of Module-based applications within the Tribiq content management system, Tribiq CMS.
Outline.
The key interface elements in Tribiq CMS are:
Admin Toolbar - a tabbed administrative toolbar present on all pages in the frontend and used for accessing different viewing modes and settings for the page.
Floating admin boxes - launched by pressing buttons in both the admin back-end and the Admin Toolbar, floating boxes overlay the page and commonly provide the administrator with access to settings.
All native functionality in Tribiq CMS is written in TUIX. This enables modification and integration of new functionality by Plugins.
The XML defined in the TUIX document is converted into a PHP array on the server before being sent via JSON to the client (a web browser) to be rendered.
If multiple TUIX documents are defined with the same elements, the TUIX documents will be merged in the PHP array. This makes it easy to add new features to existing interfaces.
Examples.
A very simple admin panel could be defined with the following XML:
This will place a link to the panel in the left-hand column of the admin back-end and place an item in the panel with the text 'My Item'.
TUIX also supports the definition of a data source which can be used to populate the <items> tag dynamically:
The TUIX model can be further modified by manipulating the PHP array before it is sent to the client.

Thomas Vavasour

Thomas Vavasour (born about 1536-7; died at Kingston upon Hull, 2 May 1585) was an English Roman Catholic physician, and pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge.
Life.
On 25 June 1549, at the disputations held before the king's commissioners at Cambridge, Vavasour was one of the disputants in favour of Transubstantiation and the Sacrifice of the Mass. He subsequently went to Venice, where he took the degree of M.D., and on 20 November 1556, he received a licence from the College of Physicians of London to practise for two years. 
His house was "by the common school house" in the city of York; there Mass was said in 1570. In 1572 he was accused of having entertained Edmund Campion. In Nov., 1574, after he had been confined to his own house in the city of York for nearly nine months, he was sent into solitary confinement in Hull Castle. 
Edmund Grindal describes him as "sophistical, disdainful, and illuding arguments with irrision, when he was not able to solute the same by learning", and adds that "his great anchor-hold was in urging the literal sense of "hoc est corpus meum", thereby to prove transubstantiation". By June, 1579, he was back again in his house, where Mass was again said. 
Later on, he was in the Gatehouse, Westminster, from which he was released on submitting to acknowledge the royal supremacy in religious matters; but he was again imprisoned as a recusant in Hull Castle, York where he died. His wife, Dorothy, died in the New Counter, Ousebridge, York, 26 October 1587.

Ravenscraig Castle

Ravenscraig Castle is a ruined castle located in Kirkcaldy which dates from around 1460. The castle is an early example of artillery defence in Scotland. Now managed by Historic Scotland and protected by Scheduled Ancient Monument this has been recognised as a category A listed building.
History.
The construction of Ravenscraig Castle by the mason Henry Merlion and the master carpenter Friar Andres Lesouris was ordered by King James II (reigned 1437-1460) as a home for his wife, Mary of Guelders. The castle is considered one of the first - perhaps the very first - in Scotland to be built to withstand cannon fire and provide for artillery defence. The king was involved with the planning but, ironically, was killed in a tragic accident with a loaded cannon at the Siege of Roxburgh Castle near Floors Castle in the Scottish Borders. The castle was eventually started around 1460 by his wife, Mary of Guelders, as a memorial to him and as a dower house. Mary of Guelders lived in the castle until her death in 1463, when only the east tower and the basement of the central section were built. Ownership passed to her son James III (reigned 1460-1488) but in 1471 he gave the castle to William Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and Caithness in exchange for the Earldom of Orkney and associated lands which James annexed from Norway to the Scottish Crown. After 1471 Ravenscraig was finally completed by the Sinclairs, who also had an interest in artillery fortifications.
During the 1650-51 invasion of Scotland by English forces under Oliver Cromwell, Ravenscraig was invaded, attacked and damaged. The castle remained in the ownership of the Sinclairs, who built nearby Dysart House (1755-1756) on the estate, and later passed to the Sinclair-Erskines, Earls of Rosslyn. The estate and castle remained in the family until sold in 1896, by the 5th Earl, to linoleum magnate Sir Michael Nairn.
The castle was used as an ammunition depot during the First World War. In 1929, of the estate, including the castle, was given to the town of Kirkcaldy as a public park. Ravenscraig Castle was passed into state care in 1955 and has been open to the public by the owners Historic Scotland since 1971. It is now managed by Historic Scotland, and is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and a category A listed building.
The castle.
Ravenscraig is a small castle, built on a narrow rocky promontory in the Firth of Forth. It is naturally defended on three sides by steep cliffs dropping to the sea, and the main part of the castle forms the northern, landward, defence. This comprises two D-plan towers, with outer walls thick, designed to withstand cannon fire. Battlements between the towers formed an artillery platform, with gun holes pointing to landward. The whole is defended by a deep, rock-cut ditch, and is accessed via a bridge. 
The towers.
The west tower stands to four storeys, and has a single small room on each floor. At the ground floor is a vaulted cellar, with a hall above, accessed via a stone forestair, or outside stairway. A spiral stair links the upper levels, although the timber floors are no longer present. Chimneys rise through the walls to form features of the castle's skyline. The east tower is of three storeys, although its base is set lower into the cliff. A well is located at the lowest level, with a single chamber on each level above, although again the timber floors are missing. The floors are linked by a straight stair within the thickness of the west wall. The rooms of both towers are windowless to landward, due to the thick walls, but have windows with stone seats to the other sides.
Linking building and courtyard.
The towers are linked by a central block, which contains the main gate and entrance passage. Vaulted cellars and a guard room lie to either side. These vaults support the artillery platform above. The gun holes are of the "inverted keyhole" type, which became common in the late 15th century. Beyond the main block, only the foundations remain of the buildings on the promontory.
"Rosabelle" by Sir Walter Scott.
Ravenscraig is the setting for the ballad "Rosabelle", sung by Lord St. Clair's bard, Harold, at the wedding feast in the sixth canto of Walter Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel. The ballad tells in elliptical style of 'the lovely Rosabelle', apparently a daughter of the St. Clair (or Sinclair) family, who insists despite dire warnings on setting out by boat from Ravenscraig (called 'Ravensheuch' by Scott) across the Firth of Forth, to attend a ball at the family seat, Roslin Castle, in Midlothian. Rosabelle knows that, as well as her parents, a certain 'Lord Lindesay's heir' will be present. However, that night an eerie light blazes on Roslin Castle and the nearby chapel where Rosabelle's ancestors lie buried, while Rosabelle herself lies drowned.

Galactitol

Galactitol (dulcitol) is a sugar alcohol, the reduction product of galactose. In people with galactokinase deficiency, a form of galactosemia, excess dulcitol forms in the lens of the eye leading to cataracts.
Galactitol is produced from galactose in a reaction catalyzed by aldose reductase. Galactose itself comes from the metabolism of the disaccharide lactose into glucose and galactose.
The other common galactose metabolism defect is a defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, an autosomal recessive disorder, which also causes a buildup of galactitol as a result of increased concentrations of galactose-1-phosphate and galactose. The toxicity associated with galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency is associated with symptoms of hepatosplenomegaly and mental retardation in addition to the cataracts caused by galactitol buildup.

57th Infantry Regiment Memorial

The 57th Infantry Regiment Memorial is a Turkish war memorial commemorating the men of the Turkish 57th Infantry Regiment who died during the Battle of Gallipoli.
The battles at Gallipoli were an eight-month campaign fought by British Empire and French forces against the Ottoman Empire in an attempt to force Turkey out of the war and to open a supply route to Russia through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea.
The Turkish 57th Infantry Regiment was the first defending unit to go into action following the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. On the first day, the 19 Division commander, Staff Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal famously ordered the regiment, "I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. During the time before we die other forces and commanders will take our place."
There is a largely symbolic cemetery containing the names of many servicemen randomly selected to be inscribed on headstones or plaques on the walls. The complex contains a three-storey tower, the cemetery, a memorial panel, an outdoor mosque and a large statue of a Turkish soldier. According to a sign at the site, the names of 1,817 soldiers who lost their lives there, including 25 officers, have been identified.
The memorial was constructed in 1992 on top of a position called the Chessboard. In 1994 a statue of the last Turkish Gallipoli survivor, Hüseyin Kaçmaz, and his granddaughter, were added following his death.

German Plot (Ireland)

The "German Plot" was a conspiracy alleged in May 1918 by the Dublin Castle administration in Ireland to exist between the Sinn Féin movement and the German Empire to start an armed insurrection in Ireland during World War I. The alleged conspiracy, which would have diverted the British war effort, was used to justify the internment of Sinn Féin leaders, who were actively opposing attempts to introduce conscription in Ireland. There is no evidence that the 1918 plot had any basis in fact. 
The "plot" originated on 12 April when the British arrested Joseph Dowling after he was put ashore in County Clare by a German U-boat. Dowling had been a member of the Irish Brigade, one of several schemes by Roger Casement to get German assistance for the 1916 Easter Rising. Dowling now claimed that the Germans were planning a military expedition to Ireland. William Reginald Hall and Basil Thomson believed him and convinced the authorities to intern all Sinn Féin leaders. 150 were arrested on the night of 16–17 May and taken to prisons in England. The introduction of internment and conscription reflected a decision of the British cabinet to take a harder line on the Irish Question following the failure of the Irish Convention. 
Paul McMahon characterises the "Plot" as "a striking illustration of the apparent manipulation of intelligence in order to prod the Irish authorities into more forceful action". Republicans were tipped off about the impending arrests, allowing some to escape capture while others chose to be taken in order to secure a propaganda victory. The internment was counterproductive for the British, imprisoning the more accommodating Sinn Féin leadership while failing to capture members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood more committed to physical force republicanism. This allowed Michael Collins to consolidate his control of the organisation and put it on a more focused military footing.
Even at the time, the proposition that the Sinn Féin leadership were directly planning with the German authorities to open another military front in Ireland was largely seen as spurious. Irish nationalists generally view the "German Plot" not as an intelligence failure but as a black propaganda project to discredit the Sinn Féin movement, particularly to an uninformed public in the United States. It is still a matter of study and conjecture what impact it had on US foreign policy regarding the 1919 bid for international recognition of the Irish Republic.

The Viceroy had jurisdiction over the provinces of Fujian, Taiwan and Zhejiang. Fujian and Taiwan were once the combined province of Fujian (abbreviated as Min () in Chinese).

Lake Hamrin, also known as Diyala Dam, is a man-made lake approximately 50 km north-east of the Baquba, in Iraq's Diyala province. The town of Hamrin sits on the western shore of the lake, both of which are at the southern tip of the Hamrin mountains.
It was established in 1981 as an artificial dam to hold over two billion cubic metres of water. It is a source of fish and also provides water for nearby date palm orchards and other farms.
In June 2008, it was reported that due to Iranian damming of the al-Wand River, the lake had lost nearly 80% of its capacity.
Archaeological excavations.
In the late 1970s, prior to the flooding of the lake, several archaeological sites in the flood plain were excavated. Excavations were led by the British Archaeological Expedition at the request of the Iraqi State Organisation for Antiquities and Heritage. Sites excavated include the Ubaid period sites of Tell Madhur, Tell Rubeidheh and Tell Haizalun. The Hamrin sites probably shared a localised form of the Ubaid culture and possibly operated as one administrative unit based out of Tell Abada.

<doc id="18741721" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18741721" title="Steyr Valley Railway">
Steyr Valley Railway

The Steyr Valley Railway () was a narrow gauge railway in Upper Austria, which ran along the valley of the River Steyr from Garsten through Steyr, Grünburg and Molln to Klaus, with a branchline to Sierning and Bad Hall. A section of the line has been retained as a museum railway.
History.
The main industries of the Steyr valley were forestry and metalworking. Timber obtained in the area was of a quality useful only for building and firewood or for the charcoal or paper production. Road transport was too expensive, and rail transport was required so the timber could be harvested profitably.
In 1868 the Rudolf Railway ("Rudolfsbahn") connected the city of Steyr to the railway network. By 1887 the Krems Valley Railway ("Kremstalbahn") reached Bad Hall and Klaus. In 1888 Josef Ritter von Wenusch received a concession for a narrow-gauge railway from Garsten to Grünburg, with a possible extension to Klaus. In the same year the Steyr Valley Railway Company ("Steyrtalbahn AG") was created and started building the railway.
1889 saw the opening of the railway to Grünburg, one year later the line was extended to Agonitz. The extension of the line to Klaus was opposed by the Krems Valley Railway Company ("Kremstalbahn AG"), who were afraid of losing a part their traffic to the Steyr Valley Railway. The "Steyrtalbahn" therefore concentrated on building the branch line from Pergern to Bad Hall, which was opened 1891.
After the nationalization of the Krems Valley Railway Company in 1902, the extension of the line to Klaus was again taken up. Construction commenced in 1908 and the extension opened in 1909. Thus the Steyr Valley network achieved its largest expansion (55 km).
Developments up to 1918.
Apart from some early setbacks traffic on the Steyr Valley Railway developed positively. There was an operating surplus and even a modest dividend could always be paid. Growth in the railway was financed by capital increases. Large shareholders in the company included the Steyr armaments company, the Steyr savings bank. and finally also the State of Upper Austria and city of Steyr for construction of the section Agonitz to Klaus.
In the First World War the line was important in providing transportation for armament makers between Steyr and Letten. A temporary roll-block wagon transfer system was provided to Letten from 1916 to 1918.
Developments up to 1945.
The end of the First World War saw economically difficult times began for the Steyr Valley Railway. Motor buses became a serious competitor, with motorbus lines between Steyr and Bad Hall, and Steyr to Grünburg. Particularly badly hit was the Bad Hall branch, where a connection existed to the Krems Valley Railway, and a majority of the passengers moved to the motorbus. All redevelopment efforts failed and in 1931 the railway was taken over by the Austrian Federal Railways (BBÖ). The branch line to Bad Hall remained unprofitable under the BBÖ, and the section Sierning to Bad Hall was closed in 1933 and dismantled at the beginning of the 'forties.
After the Anschluss and the incorporation of Austria into Germany, the Steyr Valley Railway became part of the German National Railways (Deutsche Reichsbahn or DR). The Steyr Valley Railway Company was dissolved in 1940, the railway lines became the property of the DR and thus after 1945 the property of the ÖBB.
Development after 1945.
The Steyr Valley Railway got through the Second World War without damage, nevertheless rebuilding the track was necessary. This was not done however, as there was war damage in other areas to repair first. The light track prevented the employment of the new narrow gauge diesel locomotives (class 2095) which were introduced from 1958, so that the railway continued to operate exclusively with steam engines.
Further attempts to reduce costs led in 1967 to the closure of the remaining section of the branch line, while in 1968 road buses replaced passenger trains on the section between Klaus and Molln.
On the 14th March 1980 a rock slide blocked the line between Leonstein and Haunoldmühle. The next day the line was cleared and services started up again. 14 days later however a commission came to the conclusion that trains could not work the route reliability. As a result the section Grünburg to Molln was closed. Two years later the remaining line to Grünburg was closed.
Locomotives.
For the opening of the line Krauss built three saturated steam 0-6-2T locomotives. Three further locomotives were built in 1914. The locomotives are regarded as the precursors of the famous U class.
Steyrtalbahn after the shutdown.
The Austrian Society for Railway History (ÖGEG) took over the line from Steyr to Grünburg and have operated it since 1985 as museum railway with steam locomotives. Museum operations are on Saturdays and Sundays from the beginning of June to the end of September with special trains at any time.
All other remaining railway tracks were dismantled, with much of the route converted to a bicycle path.

Almon, Mateh Binyamin

Almon (), also known as Anatot (), is a communal Israeli settlement in the West Bank. Located near Jerusalem, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. In 2011 it had a population of 1,033.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
History.
Anatot was established in 1982 by secular families with the help of the Amana organisation. It was named Anatot after the Levite city of Anathoth mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah 1:1. The later name Almon has its origins in the Bible. (Joshua 21:18, here mentioned together with Anatot)
Until 1990, Anatot was the site of an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) detention center. It was closed on February 7, 1990 after the Association for Civil Rights in Israel petitioned the High Court of Justice to shut down the jail because of inhumane conditions there. The IDF closed the facility voluntarily before the High Court could rule on the petition.
Land disputes.
According to one Ta'ayush source, the settlement is built on the property of an Israeli Arab citizen, Abu Salah al Rifai. Anatot settlers claim that they have been subject to harassment by activists, while Ta'ayush members and other activists claim they suffered attacks by large numbers of settlers from the township while trying to assist a local Palestinian in protecting his property.
Anatot is the site of one of many quarries operated by Israeli companies in the West Bank. Yesh Din legal counsel Michael Sfard said that "according to international law, so long as the West Bank is not annexed to Israel, it is forbidden for Israel to exploit the natural resources there for non-security related purposes." Sfard also stated that 74% of the gravel mined from these quarries is used for construction inside Israel, and that that means the existence of the quarries violates international law.
The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Israeli quarries in the West Bank are legal.
Geography.
Almon is located on a hill near the ruins of the Hariton Temple and the Prat Stream, between Jerusalem, (Pisgat Ze'ev), and Ma'ale Adumim/Kfar Adumim. It is close to the Palestinian villages 'Anata and Hizma.
Transport.
Almon is connected to Jerusalem and Highway 1 via Road 437. Buses are the only form of public transport available, entering the village four times per workday.
Anatot was one of a number of settlements linked by a road secretly built by settlers in 1995. The road links Anatot to Kfar Adumim, Nofei Prat, and Alon. According to Pinhas Wallerstein, then head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the road was one of a number under clandestine construction in the area. Wallerstein claimed that as council head, he did not need permission to construct roads, but that he would stop construction if the Israel Defense Forces told him to. He also said "What are they going to do, tell us to take the road away? If the road is illegal let them take us to court."
Legal status.
The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them.

Margot Lovejoy

Margot Lovejoy is a digital artist and historian of art and technology. She is Professor Emerita of Visual Arts at the State University of New York at Purchase and author of the books "Digital Currents: Art in the Electronic Age" and "Postmodern Currents: Art and Artists in the Age of Electronic Media".
Biography.
Margot Lovejoy is recipient of a 1987 Guggenheim Fellowship and a 1994 Arts International Grant in India. Exhibited internationally, she has had many solo exhibitions in and around New York City including those at the Alternative Museum; P.S.#1 Contemporary Art Center; Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art; Queens Museum of Art; Neuberger Museum of Art; Stamford Museum and the Islip Museum. Her work is in the collection of, among others, the Museum of Modern Art; the Getty Institute; and the Neuberger Museum.
Apart from authoring numerous essays in various journals, and catalogs, she has also been an invited speaker at conferences on art and technology internationally. Her website "Parthenia" has been archived by the Walker Art Center as part of the pioneering adaweb.com site and her website "TURNS" was featured in the 2002 Whitney Museum Biennial. She has published several visual books: "Labyrinth" in 1991 and in 1995 "The Book of Plagues", "paradoxic mutations" and "manifestations".
Digital Currents.
In her best known historic work to date, Digital Currents: Art in the Electronic Age, Margot Lovejoy follows on the research of Frank Popper, Jack Burnham, and Gene Youngblood by documenting the historical record of the relationship between technology and art as culminating in digital art. Lovejoy recounts the early histories of electronic media for art making (video, computer art, the internet) by providing a context for the works of major artists in each media, describing their projects, and discussing the issues and theoretical implications of each to create a foundation for understanding this developing field of digital art.
In Digital Currents she explores the growing impact of digital technologies on aesthetic experience and examines the major changes taking place in the role of the artist as social communicator. She demonstrates that just as the rise of photographic techniques in the mid-19th century shattered traditional views about representation, so too have contemporary electronic tools catalyzed new perspectives on art, affecting the way artists see, think, and work, and the ways in which their productions are distributed and communicated.

Tim Lips

Tim Lips (born 7 October 1985 in Made) is a Dutch eventer.
Biography.
Both his parents were active in equestrian as well and Lips knew he wanted to be successful in the sport from a young age. Already at the age of 8 he was getting decent results in show jumping and he created experienced pony's out of total unexperienced ones. At the age of 19 he and his father decided to check if the eventing would be a successful discipline for Lips. After a few tries he decided eventig would become his future sport. Besides his top horse Oncarlos Lips rides 8 to 10 horses a day in the professional accommodation in Made. These are his own horses, as well as other horses brought in by other people to prepare them for events. Lips is even in the position to enter the show jumping events himself with those horses from time to time. This gives him a continuous rhythm and he can prepare his horses for a 1.35m height, which makes sure the eventing heights are no problem for his horses. Lips is part of the A-class Seniors Eventing of the KNHS (The Royal Dutch Equestrian Association) as well as the Rabobank Talents Team, which is a project of the Rabobank and the KNHS to discover young talented riders at an early age.
Lips won two eventing races in the M-Class in 2005 both with Oncarlos, in IJsselstein and Barchem, he also reached a second place in Bathmen, also on Oncarlos. In 2006 he became second, in the CCI meeting in Jaroszwoka, Poland and third in Ede. On this last event he also became the Dutch national Young Rider champion. At the European Championships for Young Riders in Pardubice, Czech Republic he became fifteenth, but managed to get the award for Best Equestrian. He continued his year by winning a CIC event in Varsseveld and becoming second in Nichelino. He became 10th at the CIC event in Boekelo, 2007, but this was enough to claim the Dutch national title. During his first World Cup appearance in Fontainebleau he finished on the 30th position. In Ede he became 2nd in the CIC competition with Oncarlos and third in the CCI competition with Van Schijndel's Owaola. A the CICO in Aachen he finished in 13th position and with the Dutch team he finished in 5th position.
In April 2008 Lips and Oncarlos finished on the seventh position of the CCI race in Vairano. Later he became third in Outdoor Gelderland with Van Schijndels Owaola and in July he finished second in the CHIO Aachen, the World's largest equestrian meeting. This earned enough points to be among the top 30 at the World Rankings, which gave him the international nomination for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Because he also achieved the Dutch standards (finishing among the top 12 in this tournament) the qualification was a fact.

<doc id="18741874" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18741874" title="Ultrasonic grating">
Ultrasonic grating

An ultrasonic grating is a type of diffraction grating produced by interfering ultrasonic waves in a medium altering the physical properties of the medium, and hence the refractive index, in a grid-like pattern. The term acoustic grating is a more general term and can include operation at audible frequencies as well as ultrasonics.
An ultrasonic wave is a sound wave having a frequency greater than 20 kHz. The human ear cannot recognize ultrasonic waves, but animals such as bats and dogs can easily sense the ultrasonic wave. It is produced by the phenomena of the Piezo-electric effect and magnetostriction.
Mechanism.
When ultrasonic waves are generated in a liquid in a rectangular vessel, the wave can be reflected from the walls of the vessel. These reflected waves are called echos. The direct and reflected waves are superimposed causing a standing wave to be formed. The density of the liquid at a node is more than the density at an antinode. Hence, the liquid acts as a diffraction grating to a parallel beam of light passed through the liquid at right angles to the wave.
The diffraction grating formed in this way is analogous to a conventional diffraction grating with lines ruled on a glass plate. The less dense antinodes refract light less and are analogous to the transmitting slits of a conventional grating. The denser nodes refract light more and are analogous to the opaque part of a conventional grating.
Mathematics.
The grating element is equal to the wavelength of the ultrasonic waves. Let it be denoted by formula_1. If formula_2 is the wavelength of the light passed through the grating which is diffracted by an angle formula_3, then the nth order of the maximum is given by:
or
If v is the velocity of the ultrasonic wave in the liquid 
we can calculate the velocity of the wave with:
or,
where formula_8 is the frequency of the wave.
Debye-Sears method.
Debye-Sears method is used to determine the wavelength of monochromatic light using an acoustic or ultrasonic gratings. This method utilises the concept of Piezo electricity to obtain a grating.
The phenomenon of diffraction of light using an ultrasonic grating was first observed by Debye and Sears in 1932. When ultrasonic waves are propagated in a liquid, the density varies from layer to layer due to periodic variation of pressure. This grating can be used to determine the wavelength of monochromatic light and the speed of waves.
If formula_9 is the wavelength of a monochromatic light source, and formula_10 is the wavelength of the ultrasonic waves, then applying the principle of diffraction, we get
Where formula_12 is the angle of diffraction.
Thus we can calculate either formula_9 or formula_10 if the other is known. We need not worry about the grating element since the nodes themselves act as slits, hence the distance between two slits will be equal to the ultrasonic wave wavelength.
This method is used to determine the velocity of ultrasonic waves using monochromatic sources like sodium vapour lamps. The medium is usually a piezo electric crystal such as quartz, tourmaline, or rochelle salt. A mechanical stress is produced along an axis of the crystal using an RF oscillator. By adjusting the frequency of the oscillator, we can determine the velocity formula_15 of the ultrasonic waves by using
where formula_17 is the frequency of the oscillator.

Perihepatic packing

Perihepatic packing is a surgical procedure used in connection with surgery to the liver. In this procedure the liver is packed to stop non arterial bleeding, most often caused by liver injury. 
During this surgery laparoscopic pads are placed around the site of the bleeding. The main purpose of hepatic packing is to prevent the person from succumbing to the trauma triad of death. Under- or over-packing of the liver can cause adverse outcomes, and if the bleeding cannot be controlled through this surgical method, the Pringle manoeuvre is an alternate technique that can be utilized.

Rhencullen ( previously Orrisdale South) including Birkin's Bend is situated between the 15th Milestone and 16th Milestone road-side markers on the Snaefell Mountain Course between Kirk Michael Village and Bishopscourt on the primary A3 Castletown to Ramsey Road and the road junction with the tertiary C19 Orrisdale Loop Road in the parish of Michael in the Isle of Man.
This series of bends was part of the Highland Course and Four Inch Course used for the Gordon Bennett Trial and the Tourist Trophy automobile car races held in the Isle of Man between 1904 and 1922. Also, Rhencullen is part of the Snaefell Mountain Course used since 1911 for the Isle of Man TT and Manx Grand Prix Races.
The area is dominated by the farmland at Ballarhenny and the manse of Bishopscourt, including Birkin's Bend, Cloudy Lane and Rhencullen Hill. During an early morning practice session for the 1927 Isle of Man TT, Archie Birkin swerved to avoid a fish-van travelling to Peel and crashed fatally. The corner at Rhencullen on the A3 primary road where the accident occurred was renamed 'Birkins Bend.' From 1928 onwards, practice sessions for the Isle of Man TT Races and Manx Grand Prix were held on closed-roads.
The Rhencullen complex of bends including Birkin's Bend was subjected to road widening and reprofiling during the winter of 1953/1954 for the 1954 Isle of Man TT Races.

The Hawk Stone is a neolithic standing stone just north of the hamlet of Dean, Oxfordshire, England. 
Name.
The name either derives from its shape, being like a hawk, or is a corruption of the word 'hoar' meaning 'old'.
Description.
The Hawk Stone stands on Spelsbury Down, 900 metres west of Spelsburydown Farm. The stone stands to a height of 2.6 metres, and it has a width of approximately 1 metre by 0.9 metres at its base and tapers to 0.9 metres at the apex. It is made from oolitic limestone. A concave hollow in its upper face is known to have been worn over time by people rubbing the stone for luck, although it may originally have been natural in origin.
In legend.
Local tradition has it that the cleft in the top of the stone was made by the chains of witches who were tied to the stone and burnt alive.

Phospho-Energon, often just called Energon, was a 'miracle medicine' produced and distributed in Sweden. Through the sales of Phospho-Energon, the emerging Swedish pharmaceutical company A.B. Pharmacia (founded in 1911 out of the "Elgen" pharmacy in central Stockholm) was able to establish itself on the market. With the incomes generated by the Energon sales Pharmacia was able to initiate pharmaceutical research and the production of other medicines, eventually becoming a major actor in the Swedish and international pharmaceutical sectors. The main ingredients of Energon were calf's brain, sugar and milk. Initially, the drug was sold as a powder to be mixed with liquid, but later pills were produced.
The product was said to have a 'safe and rapid effect against general debility, lack of appetite, nervous tension, exhaustion, and sleeping problems'. The drug was also used against blood deficiency and disturbances in the neural system. Moreover, the advertisement of Pharmacia claimed that consumption of Energon would relieve the user of fear of traffic, through the soothing of the nerves.
In early advertisements, Pharmacia claimed that the drug was endorsed by Swedish physicians. Moreover, the company stressed that its production was conducted under the scrutiny of professor Karl Albert Vesterberg.
The permit to sell the Phospho-Energon pills in Swedish pharmacies lapsed in 1936. The permits to sell four variations of the Phospho-Energon pills (with arsenic, iron and kola extracts) in Swedish pharmacies lapsed in 1943.

B&amp;G

B&G, formerly known as Brookes and Gatehouse, is the leading developer and manufacturer of advanced instrumentation systems for racing and cruising sailing yachts.
Introduction.
Its equipment can be found on many of the world's leading sail racing yachts, including the majority of competitors for recent competitions such as the 2007 America's Cup and the 2008–09 Volvo Ocean Race.
History.
The company was founded in 1956 by Major R.N. Gatehouse and Ronald Brookes who had formed a partnership the previous year to develop and manufacture a new radio direction finder (RDF) for use by private sailing boats. In 1956 the 'Homer' receiver was produced, said to be the first transistorised RDF to be made available to the world's leisure marine market.
Over the course of the 1950s, B&G, now based in Romsey on the south coast of England, extended its activities into echo sounders and in 1960 produced its first speedometer. In 1966 the ketch "Gypsy Moth IV", the yacht which earned Sir Francis Chichester his single-handed circumnavigation record, was equipped with a full suite of B&G instruments.
In the 1970s and 1980s the company continued to rapidly innovate, receiving in 1981 a Design Council Award for its Hercules electronic data system, which effectively introduced computers to leisure boating, and continues to do so to this day, remaining the market leader in advanced instrumentation systems for grand prix racing yachts and sailing superyachts, as well as for club racers and blue water cruising yachts.
As a company B&G has changed hands a number of times during its 53 year lifetime, and is now a subsidiary of Navico, the Norwegian based leader in the marine electronics sector. B&G however remains headquartered just a few miles from its birthplace, in Romsey, Hampshire.
As of 2013. B&G Production has moved to Mexico and the Romsey Production facility has closed.
Products.
B&G produces integrated instrumentation systems that collect and analyse a wide range of data relating both to a yacht's performance and the external conditions in which it is sailing. This information can then be displayed to the helmsman, navigator and crew and/or analysed by integral data processing functions to produce additional information flows that enable the yacht's crew to make informed decisions with regard to performance optimisation and navigation strategy and tactics - particularly in a competitive environment.
Data that is collected may include apparent wind speed, apparent wind angle, boat speed, heading, position (Latitude/Longitude) and depth. By combining and analysing these inputs a B&G system can calculate and display in real time information such as true wind speed, true wind direction, course over ground, Velocity made good, time and distance to next waypoint, and much more. This data can additionally be fed into tactical navigation software such as B&G's proprietary Deckman system and analysed against tidal and current databases, electronic charting and weather prediction feeds to enable the navigator to devise the fastest and most efficient route between two or more points. This information can also be fed into autopilot systems.
In 2008 the B&G product range is centred around the H3000 system, with a wide range of configurations available for boats of all types and sizes. Grand prix racing yachts typically include the ground-breaking WTP2 (Wave Technology Processor) which compensates for the movement of the boat itself through the water via a three axis rate-gyro sensor to give even greater accuracy in data read-outs, and at substantially higher speeds than conventional systems.
Alongside instrumentation, B&G also designs and manufactures self-steering gear for sailing yachts. Their autopilots have been used by many short-handed racers, including Dame Ellen MacArthur during her single-handed circumnavigation race on "Kingfisher" in the 2000-01 Vendee Globe and her outright single-handed circumnavigation record on "Castorama/B&Q".
Products include:
Service.
The B&G Service department is still located in Lymington, Hampshire, England, where B&G was first established. B&G Service can perform service and repairs for all B&G equipment worldwide, including products dating as far back as 1956.

Robert Colin Elstone (born 6 February 1964) is a British businessman, who is the current CEO of Everton Football Club.
He attended the University of Hull and is a qualified accountant. He was originally a financial controller at a Barnsley-based lead-processing plant but later became an Executive Assistant at the Rugby Football League. He is the brother-in-law of football manager Mick McCarthy. 
Deloitte.
At Deloitte Touche, a company he joined in the mid-1990s, Elstone acted as an advisor to leagues, clubs and sports-related organisations on a range of strategic and commercial activities.
He was involved in the creation and branding of both the Scottish Premier League and the Super League and at the time said: ""We worked on the formation of the SPL from cradle to the grave, it was long and ground-breaking, and very rewarding."
""We did a similar thing in Greece, and it was like a scene from The Godfather."
""I was summoned to meet the chairman of Panathinaikos. He sent a black limo to collect me to take me to his big country house and even looked like Al Pacino.""
He moved to BSkyB as a Director of Football Business Affairs in 2000 and worked closely with a number of Premier League clubs following Sky's acquisition of equity in four leading clubs. In 2004, he returned to Deloitte Touche as a director.
Castleford Tigers.
Whilst at his favoured Castleford Tigers, Elstone oversaw the club's preparatory work towards relocation to a new stadium.
He resigned from his position in January 2007 citing family reasons. He said: ""I have been very conscious of the declining commitment I have been able to give to the Club over the past 12 months. The combination of a demanding job, a young family and the simple fact of where I live means that I cannot fulfil my duties to the level they demand. As a lifelong fan, I have felt incredibly privileged to serve the Club in such an important capacity over the past few years.

Elstone joined Everton as deputy to Keith Wyness in June 2005. As Deputy CEO it was his responsibility to assist in ""developing an efficient organisational structure, securing and empowering a strong management team, ensuring appropriate levels of financial reporting and accountability, delivering commercial growth, principally via filling the stadium at higher yields and securing new sponsors"". He is responsible for the negotiation of the club's long-standing sponsorship deal with Chang.
He was appointed as Acting Chief Executive Officer on 5 August 2008 following the resignation of Wyness. On 22 January 2009 he was appointed as CEO on a permanent basis. Upon his appointment he said: ""This is a big job - one of the biggest in world football - but I can promise all Evertonians that I will work tirelessly for the cause.""
He courted controversy in January 2009 when he publicly suggested that Liverpool City Council's reasons for rejecting a planning application on the site of Bellefield was a "political decision", inferring that the council rejected the application so that Everton could not afford to relocate to a neighbouring borough.
On 18 February 2009 he told listeners of the local radio station BBC Radio Merseyside that Goodison Park was "one of the worst stadiums in the country" and critics accused of him of 'doing a Ratner'.

United States Army Security Assistance Command

The U.S. Army Security Assistance Command (USASAC) – "The Army's Face to the World", implements Army security assistance programs, including Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of defense articles and services to eligible foreign governments. USASAC is responsible for life cycle management of FMS cases, from pre-letter of request, development, execution and closure. Each sale to overseas customers comprise the same "total package" of quality material, spare parts, training, publications, technical documentation, maintenance support and other services that AMC provides to Army units. The command manages about 4,300 FMS cases valued at more than $85 billion.
In addition, USASAC is responsible for Army security assistance information management and financial policy, and provides logistics guidance to the Army security assistance community. Today, the Command is increasingly responding to support of U.S. government emergency assistance, humanitarian relief, and Operations Other Than War, including United Nations peacekeeping operations. USASAC's motto is "Strength in Cooperation."
Security assistance is a national program administered by the State Department. In conjunction with the White House, Congress, and the Treasury Department, military security assistance programs are executed by the Department of Defense (DOD). Security assistance promotes regional stability, deters aggression, maintains alliances, and disseminates democratic values between the United States and its allies.
In carrying out the Army security assistance mission, USASAC calls on all AMC Life Cycle Management Commands, as well as other Department of Defense agencies and U.S. industry for support. USASAC is responsible for life cycle management of FMS cases, from development to execution, financial management, accounting, and settlement. Each sale of equipment to overseas customers comprises the same "total package" of quality materiel, spare parts, training, publications, technical documentation, maintenance support, and other services that AMC provides to U.S. Army units.
Currently, USASAC is actively engaged in the "train and equip" mission in both Iraq and Afghanistan as well as provides support to more than 20 coalition partners. It was anticipated that sales in 2008 would exceed $15 billion.
USASAC, which traces its origins to the Army's technical service era, was designated a major subordinate command (MSC) of the U.S. Army Materiel Command in 1975.
History.
Security assistance, a national program administered by the State Department, is a major component of U.S. foreign policy. Prior to the reorganization of the Army in 1962, which included the formation of the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC), the predominant Army technical service involved in the U.S. Foreign Aid Program was the Ordnance Corps' Mutual Security Division, which had program responsibility for foreign aid programs for the Corps. In 1962, the foreign aid functions of the Army technical services were placed into a central organization, creating the Mutual Security Agency (MSA).
AMC's role in security assistance crystallized in February 1965 when the Logistic Control Office of the Supply and Maintenance Command (SMC) was assigned from the U.S. Army Terminal Command, Atlantic, to New Cumberland Army Depot, Pa. That same year, the Mutual Security Directorate of the SMC Logistic Control Office, N.Y., was transferred to New Cumberland, and on 1 August 1965, the U.S. Army SMC International Logistics Center (ILC) was established as a separate activity at New Cumberland.
In 1966, the growing ILC was redesignated the U.S. Army International Logistics Center, and the SMC was discontinued and its functions were assumed by AMC. Supporting our allies in Vietnam, the ILC continued to expand, as elements of the MSA were transferred to New Cumberland, and Mutual Security Field Offices for Europe, Far East, and the Southern Command were transferred to administrative control of the ILC.
Army security assistance was elevated to Major Subordinate Command status on 1 November 1975 when the U.S. Army International Logistics Command (USAILCOM) was formed at Headquarters, U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command (DARCOM, formerly AMC, redesignated AMC in 1984), Alexandria, Va. An expanded USAILCOM was reorganized in 1977 and redesignated the U.S. Army Security Assistance Center (USASAC), reflecting its mission (delegated by the CG DARCOM) as the Department of the Army Executive Agent for Security Assistance materiel programs.
USASAC gained 200 employees in 1979 when the Office of the Project Manager, Saudi Arabia National Guard Modernization was assigned to USASAC. The Army security assistance mission was further consolidated in August 1985 when USASAC and Headquarters AMC developed and implemented the Army Centralized Case Management System, under which USASAC was designated the Army single point of contact for managing Foreign Military Sales (FMS). On 1 April 1990, USASAC was redesignated as the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command to reflect its expanded responsibilities.
Within a year, USASAC's performance in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm became the stuff of legend. In addition to supporting foreign customers and coalition forces, USASAC employees supported U.S. forces' management of Saudi Arabia's helicopter assets and parts, plus the equipping of Kuwaiti civilians with combat uniforms as they accompanied U.S. in-theater combat forces. Operations personnel were on-call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and requirements turnaround times for secondary items was reduced from previous years and months to mere days. Overall, new FMS in fiscal year 1991 hit an all-time high of $10.1 billion.
Since its formation, USASAC has supported major military operations and helped spearhead international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Its legacy is not without tragedy; the 1995 terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia took seven lives and injured dozens of USASAC employees.
On 1 October 2001, USASAC relocated its headquarters to Fort Belvoir, Va., completing a planned move onto government-owned property.
Today, USASAC remains "The Army's Face to the World," – the one-stop focal point for Army FMS and the "international partner of choice" in U.S. security assistance. Serving 140 allies and friendly countries and multinational organizations, with support by AMC, other DOD agencies and in partnership with U.S. industry, USASAC provides materiel, training, education and other services to help our allies strengthen their defensive capabilities, deter aggression, achieve regional stability, and promote democratic values.

World News Connection is a compilation of current international news translated into English language. The United States Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service compiles and distributes it from non-U.S. media sources, usually within 24-72 hours from the time of the original publication or broadcast. 
The information is usually the full text of newspaper articles, television and radio broadcasts, online sources, conference proceedings, periodicals, and non-classified technical reports. This information is collected and translated to aid decision makers at the highest levels of the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. Government who need to know what is happening abroad and how it is being reported locally. WNC is especially useful for access to local thoughts and perceptions for those who don't know the local language. It covers 130 countries, including many out of the way places not generally covered by other news services. It also contains news analyses by OSC specialists. [http://wnc.fedworld.gov/WNCwhitepaper.pdf]
World News Connection is the online offering from the Open Source Center (OSC) (formerly the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS)) that replaces the hard-copy regionally-oriented "pink books" that used to be among the most prized government publications among academics, who received them free. Due to a shift in the 1990s toward copyright compliance, the online version is a limited rendition (about half) of what is available for internal government use.
DIALOG, a commercial search service under Proquest, offers an alternative but fee-based means of accessing WNC content. WNC material is also available from Acquire Media, Country Watch, East View Information Services, NISC Pty Ltd (South Africa), and Westlaw.

Ballig ( and also known as Ballig Bridge) is a small hamlet of a few houses situated between the 8th Milestone and 9th Milestone road-side markers on the Snaefell Mountain Course between Ballacraine and Glen Helen. It is the site of a former notorious hump-back bridge used for the Isle of Man TT Races on the primary A3 Castletown to Ramsey and the road junction with the A20 Poortown Road in the parish of German in the Isle of Man.
The former Ballig Bridge was part of the Highland Course and Four Inch Course used for the Gordon Bennett Trial and Tourist Trophy automobile car races held in the Isle of Man between 1904 and 1922. Also, Ballig Bridge was part of the St John's Short Course used between 1907 and 1910 and part of the Snaefell Mountain Course used since 1911 for the Isle of Man TT Races and 1923 for the Manx Grand Prix.
The area is dominated by the farmland, including the Beary Mountain, St John's village, and Tynwald Mills. A number of changes occurred to the Mountain Course during the 1930s with extensive road widening on the A18 Mountain Road and the removal of the hump-back bridge and road straightening at Ballig for the 1935 racing season and the road work is completed for the Manx Grand Prix in September 1935. The George Formby film No Limit (1936 film) used the 1935 Isle of Man TT races as a backdrop for filming including Ballig Bridge.

Morogo

Morogo, also known as wild or African spinach, refers to a group of at least three different dark green leafy vegetables found throughout Southern Africa and harvested for human consumption. It is considered a traditional South African dish and forms an important part of the staple diet in rural communities.
Health benefits and safety.
Morogo leaves have a protein content of up to 36%. The ultimate vitamin content is dependent on the age of the plant and method of preparation; the plants contain vitamin A and vitamin C and complement the low levels of calcium, magnesium and iron in maize.
An examination of three widely consumed variants have found that its consumption may lower the risk of vascular-related chronic diseases and type 2 diabetes.
However, in some circumstances Morogo may increase the risk of fungal infection, specifically fusariosis, especially among imuno-compromised individuals such as those suffering from Aids. A study found high levels of "Alternaria" fungi in internal leaf structures and "Fusarium" fungi on leaf surfaces. A separate study asserts that Morogo is not a natural host to Fusarium, but may be cross-infected by close proximity to maize crops.

Pocklington Reef

Pocklington Reef is a coral reef and a mostly submerged atoll in the far southeast of Papua New Guinea.
It is 162.4 km from the closest island, Loa Boloba, which is a tiny coral islet within the fringing reef near Cape Deliverance, the south east point of Rossel Island (Yela) in the Louisiade Archipelago, and belongs to Milne Bay province, Samarai-Murua District, Louisiade Rural Local Level Government Area.
Pocklington Reef sits on top of Pocklington Ridge, which extends northeast from Rossel Island. The reef is 32 km long and up to 4 km wide. Its longer axis is northeast-southwest. The rim of the reef encloses a deep lagoon. The northern rim reaches closer to the surface, and several above water rocks with heights between 0.9 and 3 metres high lie along its length. There is a small spit of sand about the size of a football field (less than one hectare) at the northeast end. There is a shipwreck at that location. 
On 28 April 1962, Panamanian SS Dona Ourania grounded on Pocklington Reef.

Die beiden Neffen

Die beiden Neffen (The Two Nephews), also known as Der Onkel aus Boston (The Uncle from Boston), is a three-act Singspiel by Felix Mendelssohn to a libretto by Johann Ludwig Casper.
Background.
"Die beiden Neffen" was written by between May 1822 and 1823, during which time Mendelssohn celebrated his fourteenth birthday. The libretto was by Casper who had provided books for his three previous Singspiels, "Die Soldatenliebschaft" (Soldier's Love) (1820), "Die beiden Pädagogen" (The Two Teachers) (1821) and "Die wandernden Komödianten" (The Roving Actors) (1822). "Die beide Neffen" was the last of their collaborations. These pieces were designed for performance within the family circle at the musical gatherings regularly organised by Felix's father Abraham Mendelssohn. "Die beiden Neffen" was performed in the garden house of the Mendelssohn family on or around Felix's 15th birthday (3 February 1824). Like Mendelssohn's other juvenile operas, the work shows the influence of Mozart and Carl Maria von Weber, but without any of the individuality which began to show in the later "Die Hochzeit des Camacho".
The dialogue for the third act has been lost, but has been reconstructed, enabling the first modern performances; on 3 October 2004 (concert performance in Essen), and on 14 April 2007 (staged performance, Pfalztheater, Kaiserslautern). There is also a CD recording conducted by Helmuth Rilling.
Synopsis.
Brandenburg in the 1780s. Baron von Felsig has returned unexpectedly from New England. The consequent problems of mistaken identities and misunderstandings fill out an undistinguished storyline leading to a traditional happy ending.

Airview Historic District

The Airview Historic District is a district of 12 houses built between 1896 and 1930 on each side of East Main Street in Middletown, Maryland. The district was developed to take advantage of the Hagerstown and Frederick Railway, which paralleled what was then known as the National Pike, and is an example of a small-scale streetcar suburb. The subdivision was subdivided from the Kefauver farm and included a trolley stop in front of developer Lewis Kefauver's house. The trolley right-of-way is still visible in the deep setback between the street and the sidewalk in the front yards of houses on the north side of the street. 
The subdivisions's location in a then-rural setting view with its expansive views made the suburb attractive for retiring farmers.
The Airview Historic District is now part of Middletown, but is separated from the Middletown Historic District by a section of newer development.

Gaston Charlot (11 June 1904 – 17 April 1994) was a French chemist, founder of modern analytical chemistry in France.
Charlot graduated from the École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris; he worked on the catalytic oxidation of organic substances in the gas phase. In 1945, he became professor of analytical chemistry at the École supérieure, and also lectured at the faculté des sciences de Paris and at the Institut national des sciences et techniques nucléaires.
Charlot generalized the Bronsted-Lowry theory of acid-base chemistry to complex chemistry. In 1943, he published "Théories et méthodes nouvelles d'analyse qualitative" (New theories and methods of qualitative analysis), which eliminated traditional methods such as hydrogen sulfide tests by replacing them with electrochemical or colorimetric tests, complex chemistry, and non-aqueous chemical reactions. After some reluctance from part of the chemistry community, the Charlot method found approval after the first European post-war analytical chemistry congress, held in Utrecht in 1948.
Gaston Charlot was the author of many reference works in analytical chemistry, including his "Cours de chimie analytique générale" and "Les réactions chimiques en solution aqueuse". He was elected member of the French Academy of Science in 1970 and knight of the Légion d'honneur.

Mourad Boudjellal is a French businessman, the proprietor of comic publisher Soleil Productions. 
He was born on 5 June 1960 in Toulon, France. He is currently the President of the Toulon Rugby Union club.
In the first part of the 21st century, he has opened his cheque book in an attempt to bring his home town rugby team to prominence. His signings of international stars such as past Toulon players George Gregan, George Smith, Sonny Bill Williams and Tana Umaga, plus current stars Steffon Armitage, Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe, Matt Giteau, Simon Shaw, Joe van Niekerk and Jonny Wilkinson, have led British rugby commentator Martin Gillingham to call Toulon a "band of galacticos" (an obvious reference to Real Madrid's galáctico policy).
His time at the helm of Toulon has not been without controversy. Most notably, he drew a 130-day dressing room and pitchside ban from Top 14 organizer LNR for the following outburst after a narrow Toulon loss to Clermont in January 2012:"I had my first refereeing sodomy in the ] semi-final against Clermont. I've just had my second tonight. It appeared to hurt the first time but it was just as bad this time. We will review the images not on YouTube but on YouPorn."
Nonetheless, his tenure has seen tremendous commercial success for the club. ESPN rugby journalist Ian Moriarty remarked during the 2012–13 season, Boudjellal claimed earlier this season that the financial performance of the club meant he no longer needed to put his own cash in. Whatever you think about his penchant for throwing verbal grenades in the media from time to time, his management from a commercial point of view has been impressive. Toulon have increased their turnover by 500% during his tenure, allowing the club to spend right up to the limit of the salary cap.

Sun Yang

Sun Yang (; born 1 December 1991 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang; ancestral home Huai'nan, Anhui) is a Chinese Olympic and world-record-holding distance swimmer. He swam for China at the 2008 Olympics. At the 2010 Asian Games, he won the men's 1500m freestyle in an Asian Record; this swim and his two other medals at the Games were cited in his being named the Rookie of the Year at the 2010 CCTV Sports Awards. At the 2011 World Championships, Sun broke the world record in the 1500 metre freestyle, set by Grant Hackett in 2001 and the longest-held world record in swimming at the time it was broken, and the only men's swimming record to not have been beaten during the techsuit era. He won the 400 m and 1500 m freestyle at the 2012 Summer Olympics, becoming the first Chinese man ever to win an Olympic gold medal in swimming. At the 2012 Olympics, he was one of two male swimmers to win two individual titles, the other being Michael Phelps.
Swimming career.
Although Sun Yang had been swimming for several years, his international breakthrough happened at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. At the age of 16, Sun placed 28th in the 400 m freestyle (3:50.90), unable to reach the final. He rebounded from this by qualifying seventh fastest for the 1500 m freestyle in a time of 14:48.39. In the final he would go on to swim much slower and finish dead last in the Olympic final (15:05.12).
This was just beginning of his career, as the following year at the World Championships in Rome, he would go on to win his first international medal with a bronze in the 1500 freestyle with a time of 14:46.84. He also placed 18th in the 400 freestyle (3:47.51).
2010 Asian Games.
Sun Yang's big breakthrough happened at the 2010 Asian Games. Here, Sun won gold medals in the 1500 freestyle, 4x200 freestyle relay, and silver medals in the 200 and 400 freestyle. On note, his 1500 freestyle time of 14:35.43 was a new Asian record and the second fastest time in history, only second to Grant Hackett. This led many to believe that Sun would inevitably break Hackett's hallowed mark.
2011 World Aquatics Championships.
On the first day of competition, Sun placed second in the 400 freestyle, losing to Park Tae-Hwan in a time of 3:43.24. Three days later, he would go on to win his first World Championship title in the 800 freestyle with a time of 7:38.57. After a day of rest he would go on to anchor the China team to a bronze medal in the 4×200 freestyle relay. On the final day of competition, Sun competed in the 1500 freestyle. Hailed as the favourite for the event before the race, Sun Yang won with the time of 14:34.14, ten seconds ahead of the rest of the field. With that time, Sun Yang also broke the World Record previously set by Grant Hackett, 14:34.56, which stood for ten years before Sun's feat.
2012 Summer Olympics.
Coming into the Games, Sun was a favorite in the 400 m and 1500 m freestyles as well as a medal contender in the 200 m freestyle. In his first event on day one, the 400 m freestyle, Sun won in a time 3:40.14, becoming the first Chinese male swimmer to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Of note, his time was also the third fastest effort in history, 0.07 sec off the world record, and a new Asian record. After a day of rest, he competed in the 200 m freestyle. In the final, he raced himself to a silver, tying with Park Tae-Hwan in a time of 1:44.93, a new national record. The following day, Sun would anchor the Chinese team to a bronze in the 4×200 freestyle relay, their first ever in the event. After the relay he would not be back in the pool until the final day of competition, where he would compete in his best event, the 1500 freestyle. After easily breezing into the final as the fastest qualifier, it seemed as though he would win by a longshot. At the initial line-up on the starting blocks, a step-down command was issued due to noises from the crowd, but instead of stepping back, Sun reacted by diving in. However, it was quickly determined this was not a false start since it was a step-down command. Thus Sun was allowed back in the competition. He went on to win the race in a time of 14:31.02, a new world record by over 3 seconds and over 8 seconds ahead of second place finisher Ryan Cochrane. These results made Sun the most successful Chinese male swimmer in Olympic history. Sun was the first swimmer to win the 400/1500 double since Vladimir Salnikov at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. His final 50m of the race was a 25.68, nearly two seconds faster than second place finisher Ryan Cochrane.
2013 World Aquatics Championships.
After a rough year of training and disputes with his coach, Sun was back in action at the World Championships. On the first day of the competition, Sun Yang improved on his silver showing at the last World Championships by winning Gold in the 400m freestyle, with a time of 3:41.59. While it was nearly a second and a half off his Olympic winning time from the previous year, he was still over three seconds ahead of the second place finisher Kosuke Hagino. Two days later, Sun was able to retain his title in the 800m freestyle with a time of 7:41.36. It was his second gold medal in this Championships and the 100th gold medal won by China in the World Aquatics Championships history. On day six of the meet Sun was given the task of anchoring the 4 x 200 m freestyle Chinese relay team. China barely slid into the final at eighth place, but many thought Sun would be a huge benefit to the team, as China was the previous bronze medalists in this event at the last World Championships. Going into the final leg, China was in fifth, over two seconds behind France and Japan. This huge difference In time meant it would take a huge leg to go by these teams for the bronze medal, but Sun was able to overtake both teams in the end with a monster time of 1:43.16, nearly two seconds faster than the second fastest. Even taking the relay exchange out of this time, its still over a second faster then Yang's flat start time of 1:44.93. On the final day of the competition, Sun repeated his title as Olympic and World Champions in the 1500m freestyle by beating Ryan Cochrane again, despite in a time of 10 seconds slower than his world record finish in 2012 Olympics. By doing so, Sun becomes the first swimmer since Australian Grant Hackett, and second in the history, to win all three long distance gold medals in freestyle (400m, 800m and 1500m) in a single world championships game. This achievement leads him to be regarded as one of the greatest distance swimmers in history.
Post-2013 Season.
A month after the World Championships in Barcelona, Sun would go on to compete in China's 12th National Games, which are held every four years. At this competition Sun was vying to become the first man of all time at the competition to win seven gold medals. In order to win seven gold medals Sun would have to add the 100 m freestyle to his repertoire, typically an event reserved for sprinters. Sun however ended up signing up for the event. With the games holding the same schedule as the Olympics, he first competed in the 400 m freestyle. He won in 3:43.68, over a second ahead of Hao Yun. The following day he won the 400 m freestyle relay event, swimming the anchor leg in 48.14 . This type of time in a world record holding distance swimmer is relatively unheard of. He followed his performances the next day by setting a new Asian Record in the 200 m freestyle with a 1:44.47, about half a second faster then what he went in London. This time was a follow up to the 1:43.16 anchor leg he had swam on the 800 m freestyle relay in Barcelona. He showed off his versatility the next day when he won bronze in the 100 m freestyle getting under 49 for the first time in 48.94.
Sun Yang had lost a month of his stipend and barred from competitive events beginning in early November for an indefinite time, after it was discovered that he was driving without a license following a fender-bender in which a bus rear-ended a relative's Porsche Cayenne that he was illegally operating.

Personal Life.
Sun's father, Sun Quanhong (孙全洪) was a volleyball player. Because his mother's last name is Yang, he was named Sun Yang. He wanted to be a singer in his childhood and his favorite singer is Avril Lavigne.
In a press conference held by the Zhejiang Institute of Sports on 4 Feb, 2013, Sun Yang was formally criticised for his behaviours. The Institute also enforced disciplinary actions on Sun, temporarily banning him from any business-related activities. This came after Sun Yang's constant appearances in sponsored events and the exposure of his relationship with his girlfriend which, according to sources, resulted in missed training sessions as well as Sun's fallout with his coach, Zhu Zhigen.
On 3 November 2013, Sun Yang was caught driving without licence following an accident in Hangzhou. He was ordered to be detained for 7 days by the police and fined 5000 yuan. On November 6, State General Administration of Sports published the statement, said Sun temporarily banning him from any business-related activities, National team's camp and join any games.

Medical findings

Medical findings will signify the collective physical and psychological occurrences of patients surveyed by a medical doctor. The survey is composed of physical examinations by the doctor's senses and simple medical devices, which build clinical findings. If necessary, the results are proofed by further diagnostic tests, which may include procedures using medical apparatus. As the findings relate to the intersubjective occurrences diagnosed by the doctor, they will be differentiated from the sum of subjective data in the patient's medical history.
The documentation of medical findings can differ between:
Out of a combination of these extracted medical findings, a doctor can deduce their diagnosis, whereby they ascribe an affliction to the patient. Medical findings that do not match these diagnoses will be labeled auxiliary medical findings, whose symptoms can illustrate other afflictions.
Although the difference is not clear in everyday parlance, medical findings and symptoms are completely delineated: during the process of confirming a medical finding the empirical character (those that can be found) of the collected medical characteristics is brought out, highlighting symptom of an affliction.
Acquiring medical findings is one of the main duties of a doctor.

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development controversy

Some decisions, actions or reports made at or by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have raised controversy. 
OECD and soft law.
Unlike many other inter-governmental organizations like the United Nations or the European Commission, the OECD cannot legislate or enforce laws and doesn't have the power to coerce a country, member or not, to alter its policy. 
However, it can have an influence on national policies through soft laws, by issuing "recommendations", "guidelines" and other "manuals", that countries or companies can refer to. Some of these guidelines have become "de facto" standards, such as the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals or the OECD Model Tax Convention. 
Also, negotiations and agreements between representatives of member countries can happen at the OECD, and have direct consequences in national laws.
OECD and taxation.
Tax havens.
The OECD and its Financial Action Task Force regularly publish the list of uncooperative tax havens. 
The FATF blacklist was the common shorthand description for the Financial Action Task Force list of "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" (NCCTs). The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carries with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often finds itself under intense financial pressure. As a result of the FATF 40+8 Recommendations (among other initiatives), most countries now require their banks to report certain suspicious financial activities to the appropriate financial regulators and law enforcement authorities. (In the United States, these are called Suspicious Activity Reports or S.A.R.'s.) Most larger countries with significant financial centres consider transactions coming from or transferring to a jurisdiction on the FATF Blacklist to be a suspicious activity, which automatically triggers closer regulatory scrutiny (and considerably more paperwork on the bank's part). Because of this, many major financial institutions will not conduct business with counterparts based in NCCTs. Since many of the countries that FATF originally listed as NCCTs have major financial industries (i.e., the Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein), such "de facto" boycotts could have a significant effect on a country's economy (or at least a politically powerful sector of the economy).
Pro-tax lobbying.
Some observers, such as the American conservative FreedomWorks foundation, argue that the OECD is lobbying for more taxes. In book series such as their Economic Survey of countries, OECD analysts advise countries on their policies including tax. Such groups also remark that the OECD is funded by tax money.
Multi-lateral Agreement on Investment.
The Multilateral Agreement on Investment was negotiated at the OECD between 1995 and 1998. While this discussion was not secret, it had low public awareness until a draft report was leaked in 1997. This had led to massive outcry and an intensive campaign against it. Eventually, countries gave in and cancelled the agreement.

Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment

The Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) supplements the UNECE Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context. It was adopted and signed in Kiev in 2003 and entered into force on 11 July 2010. It requires its Parties to evaluate the environmental consequences of their official draft plans and programmes. The Protocol also addresses policies and legislation, though the application of SEA to these is not mandatory. It applies to development plans and programmes irrespective of whether they are likely to have an impact on the territory of another state. 
In the Protocol SEA is defined as "“the evaluation of the likely environmental, including health, effects, which comprises the determination of the scope of an environmental report and its preparation, the carrying-out of public participation and consultations, and the taking into account of the environmental report and the results of the public participation and consultations in a plan or programme”" (art. 2, para. 6).
The Protocol provides for extensive public participation in government decision-making in numerous development sectors. The public not only has the right to know about plans and programmes, but also the right to comment, to have their comments taken into account, and to be told of the final decision and why it was taken. Besides considering the typical environmental effects of plans and programmes, the Protocol places a special emphasis on the consideration of human health. 
The Protocol requests Parties to inform each other about plans and programmes having significant transboundary environmental effects. When a plan or programme is likely to have such effects, the Party developing the plan or programme has to notify the potentially affected Party. If the affected Party so indicates, Parties shall enter into consultations concerning the likely transboundary environmental effects. During the consultations the public of the affected Party has the right to be informed about and to comment on the plan or programme. 
Although negotiated under UNECE, the Protocol is open to all UN member states upon approval. As of September 2013, there are 26 parties to the Protocol—25 European states plus the European Union.
Application of the Protocol is being supported by a number of measures including a Resource Manual and the Belgrade Initiative on SEA (started under the UNECE "Environment for Europe" process).

Trip Lee

William Lee Barefield III (born December 17, 1987), better known by his stage name Trip Lee, is an American Southern rapper, singer, poet, author, and pastor. Signed to Reach Records, he has recorded both as a solo artist and as a founding member of the 116 Clique. Originally from Dallas, Texas, he now resides in Washington, D.C.. He first gained recognition after appearing on the Reach Records website at the age of 16. His third album, "Between Two Worlds", was nominated for two Dove Awards and won the Stellar Award for Best Hip Hop Album in 2011.
Biography.
William Lee Barefield III was born and raised in Dallas, TX. As a young boy, Lee had dreams of being a professional athlete or a famous rapper, and he began to hone his lyrical skills at the age of 12. "I rapped about random stuff… how hot I was, how many girls I could pull," Lee says. But upon giving his life to Christ, at age 14, his focus changed from fortune, fame, and women to serving and ministering the Gospel.
Lee slowly recognized that all of his life should be centered around Christ. "One day, I just decided, I'm only doing Christian hip hop. Rappers like Ambassador and Da' T.R.U.T.H. helped provide a model for how I would begin to do that," he says. He also had an immense desire to learn and teach the Word of God, so he became a leader in his youth group where he preached his first sermon at age 17.
In 2004, Lee met Lecrae at a concert; months later, after talking and building with each other, Lecrae began to disciple him. While still in high school, Lee was given the opportunity to pen a few devotionals for the Reach Records website that dealt with theological matters and showcased his spiritual maturity.
Lee signed with Reach Records, and his debut album, "If They Only Knew", was released a few days after his high school graduation. His first full-length album introduced hip-hop fans to his distinct southern sound, unique delivery, and gospel-saturated lyrics. That same year, he was also featured on the Dove Award-nominated, "Jesus Muzik" with label mate Lecrae.
His second album, "20/20", was released in 2008 and garnered much success, breaking into the Billboard Top 200 and reaching No. 11 on the Billboard Christian albums chart and No. 4 on the Gospel chart. Back with his third studio album, "Between Two Worlds", Lee offers a collection of reflections on life in a fallen world. His hope is that his reflections not only resonate with listeners, but also point to Jesus as the hero.
Since his first album release, Lee has traveled the world doing concerts for thousands of listeners, and his last three summers have been spent on national and international tours with his Reach label mates. His Christ-centered hip-hop message has also built a platform for him among churches and other Christian organizations, which has led to numerous opportunities to preach and teach at conferences and other events.
Lee attends Boyce College, the undergraduate school of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. Lee's unending desire is to proclaim the grace and beauty of Jesus Christ to anyone that will listen; ultimately, he hopes this journey will someday lead to pastoring a church.
Lee released two new singles "Brag On My Lord" and "King Like Mine", the latter featuring Alex Medina, on March 29, 2011.
Trip Lee released his fourth full length studio album, entitled "The Good Life" on April 9, 2012. The album featured various notable Christian artists, such as Sho Baraka (formerly signed with Reach Records), J.R., Lecrae, J.Paul, KB, Andy "C-Lite" Mineo, Jimmy Needham, V.Rose, Suzy Rock, Jai, and Leah Smith. As a continuation to the album, Lee has worked with Moody Publishers and has authored a book titled "The Good Life", to be released October 1, 2012.
Lee married Jessica in 2009. On August 3, 2012 they welcomed their first child, a boy.
On October 9, 2012 Lee announced he would be "stepping away" from music altogether. The Unashamed 2012 tour with the Reach Records roster was his final tour before pursuing a career as an author and pastor. He later clarified that while he would continue to make music, he wouldn't be touring as much. He is currently training to be a pastor at his local church, while still engaging in public ministry.

2008 Mauritanian coup d'état

A coup d'état took place in Mauritania on 6 August 2008 when Mauritanian President Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi was ousted from power by a group of high ranking generals he had dismissed from office earlier that day.
Background.
General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was one of the leading figures in the August 2005 coup that ended Maaouya Sid'Ahmed Ould Taya's 21 years in power. Aziz backed Abdallahi's candidacy in the subsequent March 2007 presidential election, which Abdallahi won. Abdallahi soon angered General Aziz and his supporters, however, by reaching out to Islamic hardliners, by freeing several suspected terrorists, and by using state funds to build a mosque on the grounds of the presidential palace.
In May 2008, Abdallahi appointed 12 ministers who had been part of President Taya's former government, some of whom had been accused of corruption. This, together with the inclusion of members of opposition parties in the government (headed by Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef) and the government's failure to present a programme, led many members of the pro-Abdallahi National Pact for Democracy and Development (PNDD-ADIL) party in the National Assembly to file a censure motion against the government on June 30, 2008. The government resigned on July 2 before a no-confidence vote was held, and Abdallahi immediately reappointed Waghef to form a new government. The government that was announced on July 15 included no members of the opposition; it also excluded the former associates of Taya whose presence in the previous government had attracted criticism.
On August 4, 2008, 25 of the 49 PNDD-ADIL deputies in the National Assembly, along with 24 of the party's 45 senators, announced that they were leaving the party, thereby depriving it of its parliamentary majority.
The immediate catalyst for the coup was Abdallahi's announcement on the morning of August 6 that he was firing several generals, including Aziz (who had been the head of the presidential guard) and army chief of staff General Mohamed Ould Sheikh Mohamed. Mauritania has experienced more than 10 coups or attempted coups since achieving its independence from France in 1960.
Details of the coup.
Early in the morning of August 6, Abdallahi announced that he was firing several senior army officers, and at 9:20 a.m. he was seized from his home by members of the Presidential Security Battalion (BASEP for Bataillon de la sécurité présidentielle) in a military coup. Presidential spokesman Abdoulaye Mamadou Ba said in a statement that President Abdallahi, Prime Minister Waghef, and Interior Minister Mohamed Ould R'zeizim had been arrested by renegade senior army officers, unknown troops, and a group of generals, and were being held under house arrest at the presidential palace in Nouakchott. Of the apparently successful and bloodless "coup d'état", Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi said: "The security agents of the BASEP came to our home and took away my father."
The coup plotters were recently fired senior officers in the security forces, including General Abdel Aziz, General Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani, General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmad Ould Bakri. State television reported that the country was now being led by a new military State Council, which would be run by Abdel Aziz. The State Council said that Abdallahi was now the "former president."
General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz issued a statement on the al-Arabiya international television station and issued what he called, "communiqué No. 1" which reversed the "former president's" firing of the military officers. Al-Aziz was also reportedly holding talks with the President of the Mauritanian National Assembly, Messaoud Ould Boulkheir, on the feasibility of holding potential new elections in two months.
Police reportedly fired tear gas at about 50 people who had gathered near the main market of Nouakchott. Otherwise, the city remained calm.
All state television and radio stations in Nouakchott reportedly ceased broadcasting as the coup began. The Nouakchott International Airport was also closed.
Aftermath of the coup.
August.
According to an official statement released on August 7, Abdallahi's powers were terminated and Mauritania would be governed on a transitional basis by an 11-member High Council of State, with Abdel Aziz as the President of the Council, until a new presidential election was held "in the shortest possible period". The Council promised that this election would be "free and transparent" and that it would consult with the national institutions, the political class, and civil society. Furthermore, the Council gave an assurance that it would "respect all treaties, international agreements and conventions to which Mauritania has subscribed". The members of the Council were listed as:
A demonstration in support of the coup was held in Nouakchott on August 7. About 1,000 people participated in this demonstration, chanting Abdel Aziz's name and marching towards the presidential palace, accompanied by vehicles carrying large portraits of Abdel Aziz. At the presidential palace, Abdel Aziz spoke to the demonstrators, saying that he would "work to solve all the problems this country is confronted with". A protest against the coup was also held later on the same day in Nouakchott. According to PNDD-ADIL Secretary-General Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Dahmane, this was a peaceful protest in which 200 to 300 people participated, carrying portraits of Abdallahi, and was broken up by police with tear gas. Dahmane also called for Abdallahi's release, saying that he was the legitimate president, and said that the PNDD-ADIL had formed an alliance with three other parties in opposition to the coup: the Popular Progressive Alliance (APP), the Union of the Forces of Progress (UFP), and an Islamic party.
The High Council of State released a second statement on August 7, saying that the junta wanted to preserve the constitution and democratic institutions, interfering with the functioning of those institutions as little as possible. According to this statement, the Council would collectively exercise the powers of the presidency and a government would be appointed. The Council also said that political parties and legal organizations would be allowed to operate freely, that freedoms, including the freedom of the press, would be respected, and that municipal councils could continue to function normally. Abdel Aziz also gave these assurances regarding freedoms and the continuity of democratic institutions, such as Parliament, in a meeting with Arab League Assistant Secretary-General Ahmed bin Heli.
The four-party alliance opposing the coup, called the National Front for the Defence of Democracy, held a press conference on August 8, and this developed into a protest rally against the coup in the Tevragh Zeina section of Nouakchott, with several hundred people participating. This rally included calls for the soldiers to return to their barracks and for the international community to pressure the junta. APP spokesman Alkhalil Ould Teyib vowed that they would continue their struggle until Abdallahi was restored to the presidency. The National Front for the Defence of Democracy also announced plans for more demonstrations and activities opposing the coup, while also stating that they would only hold protests with the junta's permission.
Also on August 8, Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, said that she had not been informed of Abdallahi's whereabouts, and she expressed concern for Abdallahi's "health and safety". Meanwhile, Abdel Aziz said in an interview with "Jeune Afrique" that the military had been forced to take power by serious economic and political problems. He accused Abdallahi of attempting a "coup against democracy" through his actions; according to Abdel Aziz, Abdallahi had set members of parliament against one another and his dismissal of the senior officers immediately prior to the coup was intended to "divide the army". Abdel Aziz also said that Abdallahi was being held at the Palace of the Congress, was "in good conditions", had not complained, and would be released in a matter of days or weeks. According to Abdel Aziz, Abdallahi would probably not be required to leave Mauritania and would probably still be allowed to participate in politics. However, Abdel Aziz was quoted in an interview with "Asharq al-Awsat" published on August 9 as saying Abdallahi would not be released for "the time being", citing "security reasons"; he said that the junta was trying to establish an atmosphere of calm.
In an interview with Agence France-Presse on August 10, Abdel Aziz said that the coup was necessary to prevent "a catastrophe"; he said that Abdallahi had "acted irrationally", and in another interview with Al Jazeera he said that he had warned Abdallahi immediately prior to the coup that his decision to dismiss the senior officers could have serious consequences. According to Abdel Aziz, Abdallahi did not heed the warning, and as a result Abdel Aziz ordered the coup. Abdel Aziz also criticized Abdallahi for releasing Islamic extremists from prison and allowing the Islamist Tawassoul party to join Waghef's government in May; he asserted that this was "irresponsible" and did not reflect Mauritania's identity as a "moderate Muslim country". Furthermore, he expressed his view that the international community would change its negative attitude toward the coup "when it has all the information".
Also on August 10, Abdel Aziz did not exclude the possibility that he or other members of the junta could run for President, although he said that the issue had not been decided and that other things needed to be dealt with first. His acknowledgement of the possibility was in contrast to the decision of the previous junta in 2005 to exclude its members from running from office.
Messoud Ould Boulkheir, the President of the National Assembly, said on August 10 that he still recognized Abdallahi as President and rejected the idea of a new election held under the junta. However, 67 of the 95 deputies in the National Assembly released a statement supporting the coup and describing it as "the logical and indisputable result of President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi's behaviour to stall the republic's institutions". Meanwhile, Abdallahi's daughter said that the military had been involving itself in politics for two and a half months, and the PNDD-ADIL announced on August 10 that the junta had allowed it to reopen its offices.
Waghef and three other high-ranking officials (including the Interior Minister) were released by the military on August 11, while Abdallahi remained in custody. A few hours later, Waghef spoke before a rally of thousands of people and expressed defiance toward the junta, saying that Mauritanians did not accept its rule and urging the people to continue struggling to restore Abdallahi to power. He said that Abdallahi thanked them for their "untiring fight ... to restore constitutional order".
Arab League Assistant Secretary-General Ahmed bin Heli said on August 11, after returning from Mauritania, that he had asked to meet with Abdallahi but was not allowed to do so. In a statement on August 12, the High Council of State outlined its powers, confirming that it would have "the necessary powers to reorganise and manage state affairs during the period needed for the organising of presidential elections ... in the shortest possible time." It also confirmed that the Council would collectively exercise presidential powers and that the Council's President would be able to appoint a Prime Minister.
The Rally of Democratic Forces (RFD), which was the main opposition party under Abdallahi, supported the coup; its leader, Ahmed Ould Daddah (who was defeated by Abdallahi in the 2007 presidential election), told Al Jazeera on August 12 that the coup was "a movement to rectify the democratic process". Abdel Aziz met with political parties to discuss the formation of a new government. The APP said that it would not participate in this government, but the RFD said that it intended to "study the offer". 106 of the 151 members of both houses of Parliament (67 out of 95 deputies and 39 out of 56 senators) said in a statement on August 13 that they supported the coup. According to this statement, the coup occurred "in the context of an acute political and institutional crisis" and Abdallahi "only listened to sycophants". The statement also urged international support. Aside from the members of Parliament, 191 out of 216 mayors also supported the coup.
Abdel Aziz appointed Moulaye Ould Mohamed Laghdaf, a former ambassador, as Prime Minister on August 14, 2008. Laghdaf was already closely associated with Abdel Aziz, and some suggested that he might have been appointed in hopes that doing so would help international relations due to Laghdaf's diplomatic service in the European Union. Waghef said at a news conference on the same day that this appointment was "illegal" and that the government he had headed was still the legitimate government.
It was reported on August 15 that 71 out of 95 deputies were in favor of holding an extraordinary session of Parliament on August 20, with the intention of appointing members to a special court; this could in turn lead to a trial of Abdallahi and some of the ministers who had served under him for alleged mishandling of state affairs. On August 16, a group of 19 members of Parliament—three senators and 16 deputies—announced that it was seeking the restoration of Abdallahi to the presidency. According to Mohamed Moustapha Ould Bedredine, a deputy who spoke on the group's behalf, the group had more support than their numbers suggested.
Abdel Aziz made his first broadcast to the nation on August 17. He affirmed that a new presidential election would be held "as soon as possible", but he did not give a specific date. In this speech, Abdel Aziz promised to fight hard against terrorism and corruption; he also accused Abdallahi of failing to act against corruption and said that Abdallahi had handled the economy very poorly. On the same day, 26 members of Parliament who supported the coup announced their resignations from the PNDD-ADIL party.
On August 18, two-thirds of Mauritanian political parties—including major parties such as the RFD, the Republican Party for Democracy and Renewal (PRDR), and the Union for Democracy and Progress—grouped together to support the coup. According to PRDR leader Sidi Mohamed Ould Mohamed Vall, this was "dictated by the necessity to preserve the stability of the country and its democratic institutions", and he described the coup as "vital for Mauritania and for the maintenance of its democracy and its pluralism". Also on August 18, a pro-coup gathering, in which an estimated 25,000 people participated, was held in Nouakchott.
RFD leader Daddah said on August 19 that there was "a good chance" that his party would participate in the government headed by Laghdaf. On August 20, a large anti-coup protest was held in Nouakchott by the National Front for the Defence of Democracy. The special session of Parliament, intended to consider "the reasons for the blockage of democratic institutions" prior to the coup and to appoint the members of a special court, also opened on August 20. 32 members of Parliament boycotted the special session, which was planned to last one month.
Waghef, the former Prime Minister, said in an interview with Abu Dhabi TV on August 20 that President Abdallahi had dismissed the senior officers on August 6 because they had already been planning to seize power on August 9. He subsequently travelled to Nouadhibou in northern Mauritania in order to participate in an anti-coup protest there, but was arrested upon arrival on August 21. He was reportedly arrested because he left Nouakchott without the junta's permission. On August 22, it was announced that Waghef was being taken to his home village of Achram, where he would be kept under house arrest. According to Minister of Decentralization Yahya Ould Kebd, the junta sought to "rein in his activism", saying that "his contact with the outside will probably be limited but not banned".
The special session of Parliament included the creation of a Senate inquiry commission intended to investigate the finances of KB charitable foundation, which was headed by Abdallahi's wife, Khattou Mint Boukhary; Boukhary was a controversial figure who had been criticized by the opposition prior to the coup. On August 24, the foundation's lawyers urged the creation of international commission to investigation its finances, arguing that the Senate commission would not be fair. The lawyers said that the Senate commission's "subjective results will always be contested".
Jean Ping, the Chairman of the Commission of the African Union, met with Abdel Aziz in Nouakchott on August 25. Ping said that he was in Mauritania to discuss restoring a constitutional government, not to discuss the junta's transition, and he expressed optimism after meeting Abdel Aziz. The talks between Abdel Aziz and Ping continued on August 26. A letter from El Khadim Ould Esseman, the imprisoned leader of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, was publicized on August 25. In this letter, he denounced the junta as an "infidel regime", urging all Mauritanians to "turn to the strict application of Sharia".
On August 26, the RFD, the Alliance for Justice and Democracy - Movement for Renovation (AJD-MR), and the Movement for Direct Democracy (MDD) announced their decision to not participate in the new government that was being formed under the junta because the junta had not clarified whether or not someone serving in the military would be allowed to stand as a presidential candidate and had not specified how long it intended to remain in power. The new government led by Laghdaf was appointed on August 31 and announced on television early on September 1. This government was composed of 28 members, aside from Laghdaf, and its members were considered to be politically obscure technocrats. The government included several members of the RFD, despite that party's refusal to participate; the RFD responded by saying that the RFD members who had accepted posts in the government had "automatically resigned" from the party by doing so.
Former Head of State Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla expressed his support for the coup on August 29 and criticized the negative reactions of Western governments to the coup, alleging that they were interfering in Mauritanian affairs. In a statement on August 30, the African Union Commission said that Abdel Aziz had committed to releasing Abdallahi during his talks with Ping.
September.
On September 2, the National Assembly chose four deputies to sit on a High Court that would try Abdallahi on allegations such as corruption and obstruction of Parliament. This vote was conducted by secret ballot, and a single list of candidates was approved, with 31 votes in favor, none opposed, and one abstention. After a meeting on September 4, Ping, Said Djinnit (the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for West Africa), and Ahmed Benhelli of the Arab League released a statement reiterating Abdel Aziz's commitment to release Abdallahi, as well as calling for resolution of the situation, restoration of democratic institutions, and Waghef's release.
Laghdaf announced on September 6 that an "open and constructive debate" would be held, in which members of parliament, political parties, and other organizations would be invited to participate. The purpose of this debate, according to Laghdaf, was to determine a timetable for holding a new election and consider various matters related to that election, including proposals for constitutional amendments and improved delineation of executive and legislative powers. On September 10, the Senate chose four senators to serve on the High Court along with the four deputies that were elected eight days earlier.
On September 14, deputies present in the National Assembly unanimously approved a resolution that called for a presidential election to be held in 12 to 14 months. The length of the period was deemed necessary "to reestablish normal constitutional order and legitimacy". The resolution also called for an independent electoral commission and for the exclusion of candidacies by military officers and those who "exercised executive responsibilities susceptible of influencing voters". The possibility was nevertheless suggested that Abdel Aziz could retire from the army and stand in the election as a civilian.
In an ambush carried out by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb on September 14, 11 soldiers and a civilian were captured; a week later, their decapitated bodies were found. The brutality of this attack was considered shocking in Mauritania. Although it was observed that it could be considered a humiliation for the military, it was also suggested that the threat of Islamist terrorism might help to bring the junta out of isolation. Supportive statements from France and the European Union, referring to the struggle against terrorism, followed the attack, although they were not specifically supportive of the junta (France referred simply to "the nation and the army").
On September 23, the African Union Peace and Security Council released a statement demanding Abdallahi's "unconditional restoration" by October 6. According to the statement, "the perpetrators of the coup and their civilian supporters" would face "sanctions and isolation" if the demand was not met. The members of Parliament supportive of the coup announced on September 26 that they rejected the African Union's demand "because it simply ignores the reality in the country where two-thirds of the parliament, almost all of the elected mayors and the majority of people support the changes of August 6". Abdel Aziz, in a statement on September 27, also rejected the African Union demand. Ping said on September 29 that he was surprised by the junta's reaction to the ultimatum and that he had expected the junta to react by seeking talks with the African Union.
Speaking on Al Jazeera on September 28, former Abdallahi spokesman Abdoulaye Mamadou Ba called for popular protests to be held on October 5 as part of "a day of democracy". Sidi Mohamed Ould Maham, a deputy, was elected as President of the High Court on September 28.
In an interview with Reuters on September 29, Laghdaf said that the government would seek aid from Arab countries and institutions if aid from the West was cut off. He also asserted that, following the coup, "freedoms are preserved, parliament has never been so free." Speaking to Radio France Internationale on September 30, Laghdaf said that all demonstrations, whether they opposed the junta or supported it, would be banned, emphasizing that "what we need now is calm".
October.
Although the government banned protests, the National Front for the Defence of Democracy went ahead with its planned protest in Nouakchott on October 5. The protest began with a small group numbering a few dozen; the police asked the group to disperse, but it grew larger, with participants chanting anti-junta slogans and carrying pictures of Abdallahi. The police then responded with tear gas, breaking up the protest. Subsequently the protesters attempted smaller gatherings at various places in Nouakchott, and the police worked to disperse these as well. According to UFP President Mohamed Ould Mouloud, the "protests constitute a scathing denial of the junta's pretence that the situation in Mauritania is calm, that everybody accepts the coup and that people here have freedom of expression and live in a democracy". State media ignored the protests, as it also ignored the passing of the AU's October 6 deadline. A spokesman for the pro-junta parliamentary majority said that the AU ultimatum "doesn't scare anybody". Mouloud, acting as spokesman for the National Front for the Defence of Democracy, called for "the immediate implementation of sanctions against the junta". Ping said that the junta sent a delegation on October 6 to hold talks with the AU.
The eight-member Mauritanian delegation, led by Justice Minister Tidjane Bal, met with Ping in Addis Ababa on October 7. Following the meeting, the AU released a statement saying that Ping "reiteratethe African Union's standpoint" and that the AU Peace and Security Council would propose a way of handling the situation. On the same day, another protest in Nouakchott was held. Immediately prior to the protest, six unions said that "instead of a peaceful march we will seek a confrontation". The police used tear gas against the protesters, and protesters threw rocks at the police.
Mouloud said on October 8 that the AU should react to the rejection of its ultimatum by "declarthe military leadership illegal". The Mauritanian Information Agency (AMI) reported on the same day that the AU appeared to be taking a less hostile position since its deadline passed. Meanwhile, Boulkheir, the President of the National Assembly and the APP, called for a solution to the situation that would involve Abdallahi returning to the presidency for only the limited period necessary to organize an early presidential election. Boulkheir's proposal would also involve the formation of a government of national unity during that period.
On October 20, the EU held talks with the junta in Paris. Seeking Abdallahi's "immediate and unconditional release" and the restoration of constitutional rule, the European Union said in an October 20 statement that it was giving the junta a period of one month, after which "consultations will be terminated and appropriate measures will be proposed". Speaking for the National Front for the Defence of Democracy, Maouloud expressed satisfaction with the EU's ultimatum and remarked that "the junta has not managed to deceive the European Union".
November–December.
The first regular session of Parliament since the coup began on November 10; the main purpose of this session was to pass the budget for 2009. About 30 deputies who opposed the coup, including Boulkheir, the President of the National Assembly, boycotted the session. Elarbi Ould Jedeine, the Vice-President of the National Assembly, presided over the session, while expressing regret regarding Boulkheir's boycott. Senators opposing the coup participated in the session. Ousted President Abdallahi was taken from Nouakchott to his home village of Lemden on November 13. According to the government, Abdallahi agreed to leave politics, but Abdallahi held a news conference on November 13 in which he said that he "did not make any promises with them". He also said that being moved to Lemden was meaningless because he "remaina president under house arrest".
Upon the expiration of the EU's one-month deadline on November 20, the EU announced that, because "the junta's proposals have been deemed insufficient by the international community, EU member states will examine, based on the proposals of the European Commission, appropriate measures". It viewed Abdallahi's transfer to Lemden was a positive step, but said that it was inadequate because Abdallahi remained under house arrest. Mauritanian Minister of Communication Mohammed Ould Moine said that the situation was "a purely Mauritanian matter" which "won't be solved in Washington, Paris or Addis Ababa", and he stressed that "no-one, and I mean no-one, has the right to make decisions for my country". Also on November 20, Abdallahi said in an interview that "once the coup is thwarted" he would "be open to all dialogue to discuss the future of the democratic institutions of the country in the framework of the constitution and the laws of the country".
After it was reported on December 12 that the junta planned to release Abdallahi from house arrest by December 24, the FNDD said on December 14 that anything less than Abdallahi's restoration to the presidency was insufficient. In an interview published on December 20, Abdallahi said that he would not take part in the national consultation meeting planned for December 27, despite being invited by the junta, as he felt his participation would "legitimise the coup d'etat". Abdallahi was taken out of Lemden by security forces in the early hours of December 21, driven to Nouakchott, and then released on the same day.
The national consultative meeting began on December 27. Abdul Aziz said that this would be an entirely free and open process. The meeting was planned to consider an election date, constitutional amendments, and the role of the army. Diplomats from 70 countries were present. Abdallahi and the FNDD boycotted the meeting, although FNDD President Boijel Ould Houmeid said on December 26 that his coalition had received no invitation.
2009.
At the conclusion of the national consultative meeting on January 5, 2009, it proposed holding an election on May 30, 2009, with a second round (if necessary) on June 13. The FNDD derided the proposal as a "non-event" and alleged that the junta intended for the election to be won by "one of its members or a puppet ... who will do their bidding." The official media announced on January 23 that the new presidential election would be held on June 6, 2009.
On February 4, 2009, while still expressing support for the coup and saying that Abdallahi should not be restored to the Presidency, Daddah proposed that the army give up power and that anyone who was serving in the military at the time of the coup should not be allowed to participate in the 2009 presidential election. He expressed concern that continued military rule would negatively affect Mauritania's relations with the rest of the world, potentially including economic sanctions.
The AU imposed sanctions on the junta in early February, restricting the travel of junta members and freezing any possible bank assets. Abdel Aziz dismissed the sanctions as meaningless on February 10, saying that no one on the High Council of State had a bank account outside of Mauritania.
On March 6, 2009, the government decided to sever diplomatic relations with Israel to protest the Gaza War.
Libyan leader and AU Chairman Muammar al-Gaddafi attempted to mediate the situation during a visit to Mauritania that concluded on March 12. During this visit he met with Abdallahi, who argued that Gaddafi was biased in favor of the junta. At the end of his visit, Gaddafi said that he thought the AU's sanctions should be lifted. In Niamey on March 14, Gaddafi said that Abdallahi could not return to power because the military would not allow it, and therefore Abdallahi had no choice but to "accept a fait accompli".
