Jack Murphy (Irish politician)

(John) Jack Murphy (1920 – 11 July 1984) was an Irish politician and the first unemployed person ever elected to a national legislature. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as an independent Teachta Dála (TD) at the 1957 general election for the Dublin South–Central constituency.
Murphy was a former member of the Irish Republican Army who had been interned in the 1940s. At the time of his election, he was an unemployed carpenter. He was the candidate of the Unemployed Protest Committee (UPC), which had been formed on 12 January 1957. He resigned his seat on 13 May 1958 in protest at the indifference of the main political parties to the plight of the unemployed. After his resignation he subsequently emigrated with his family to Canada but returned to Ireland in 1964. He died on 11 July 1984.
Early years.
Jack Murphy was born in 1920 at the back of Synge Street, Dublin. He was the second youngest son of a carpenter and had five brothers and five sisters. His father, a well-known athlete who won the all-Ireland walking championship in 1903, was active in the republican movement and was a founder-member of the National Union of Woodworkers. Murphy joined Fianna Éireann at the age of 10. Up to the age of 14 he attended St Mary's National School, Rathmines, and then started work as an apprentice carpenter, while attending Bolton Street Technical College, now Dublin Institute of Technology in the evenings. He became a member of the Irish Republican Army at 16. He was also an active trade union member from an early age as demonstrated when, as a carpenters apprentice, he became one of the leaders of a strike on the River Liffey Reservoir Scheme (popularly known as the Poulaphouca Scheme). The strike lasted several months until only three of the original committee remained, with Murphy being one of them.
Arrested in 1941 by the Fianna Fáil Government, he was interned with a number of other republicans in the Curragh until the end of the The Emergency in 1945. These four years afforded him time to study, broadening his interest and outlook. A fluent Irish speaker, he was interviewed in Irish for his entry into the National College of Art and Design after his release from the Curragh. In the Mansion House Exhibition of 1950 he won an arts and crafts certificate for his leather and craftwork.
He returned to his trade of carpentry where he was quickly re-elected shop steward after he took a leading part in several actions and strikes for better conditions, most notably the strike to end the campaign of sackings by employers which took place in 1953. However in 1956, during which record unemployed figures were reached in Ireland, he found himself one of the many thousands out of work.
He emigrated to England, but returned after four months as he missed his family. He later said: 
I am against emigration for many reasons, one is that it wrecks family life. When I worked in England I nearly broke my heart thinking of my wife and youngsters all the time I was there. Here in Ireland the clergy and politicians are always preaching about the sanctity of the Christian family, but they do nothing about the unemployment and emigration that is breaking up thousands of families.
Protest committee.
Murphy came to the conclusion that the only way to fight unemployment was to do it in Ireland with an organised movement. As he saw it, with national emigration running at 40–50,000 per year, "Irish capital is being exported abroad and the Irish working class are being exported with it."
On 12 January 1957 with 11 other Dublin men they formed the Unemployed Protest Committee (UPC) for the purpose of protesting against the unemployment situation, and Jack was named as secretary. 
While some articles and papers written after the event later imply that the UPC had been a political organisation, Murphy himself never intended the UPC to be either a political organisation or political party. He explained: "The UPC was not a political organisation as such. It was intended to spotlight the problem of unemployment and emigration. That was my intention when I went to the Dáil".
To focus the eyes of the nation on the plight of the unemployed the committee organised a series of well-attended orderly marches through Dublin streets of a colourful yet serious nature. The marches were usually preceded by a home made-coffin "We organised marches through the city. We hoped to arouse the conscience of the Nation. We carried a black coffin, symbolising our only hope if we did not fight.". However despite their pageantry the UPC marches seem to have had limited impact on the employment situation and on the policy makers.
1957 general election.
The fall of the Government on 4 February 1957, due to the withdrawal of support by Seán MacBride's Clann na Poblachta, led to the 1957 general election and provided an opportunity for the UPC to dramatically escalate their protests. Seeing the need to put employment on to the political agenda the UPC decided to run a candidate. Jack Murphy said at the time:"We thought of all types of schemes to approach the politicians, we would ask them to make a statement from their election platforms on their policy to solve unemployment. But again we knew that they would easily agree to such a suggestion during the election campaign , just as easily as they would forget the unemployed after they were elected. No, the only way to make these people understand that we were a force to be reckoned with was to contest a seat in the election."
Two names were put forward as possible candidates at a meeting in Parnell Square: Sam Nolan, and Jack Murphy. After much consideration it was decided that Murphy would be more suitable. When some Committee members suggested that Nolan might be the better choice, Peadar O'Donnell argued that, with a background as a leading member of the Communist party, his candidacy might frighten voters away. Nolan himself pointed out that his Communist credentials would have a negative impact as anti-communist hysteria was rife following the Soviet invasion of Hungary of 1956.
It was decided that Murphy, with his republican background, would run in the Dublin South–Central Constituency, firstly because this inner city constituency had a high population density which would be more convenient to canvass compared than a large sprawling area, and secondly it housed the largest Labour Exchange in Dublin City, Werburgh Street. This location offered a platform for the UPC to get their message across. They distributed leaflets outside Werburgh Street while across the River Liffey on Dublin's North side, they broadcast election messages from a UPC office at the D.T.U.C in Gardiner Street, with hired and borrowed loadspeakers, to men signing on at the nearby Gardiner Street Labour Exchange.
The task of raising the £100 deposit necessary to stand as a candidate was taken on by Peader O'Donnell. He received £25 each from four friends including Fr. Counihane, a Jesuit priest who sympathised with the cause of Labour;, Digby, the owner of Pye Radio; a Fianna Fáil Senator called Murry; and Toddy O' Sullivan, manager of the Gresham Hotel. It has been said of Dublin City that "a good cause will always find support in an unexpected way"; the campaign was run on a shoestring budget. Murphy said of their financial situation, "We had no funds. With bobs and pennies sacrificed from doles and unemployment money we fought on".
After an appeal for volunteers to help in the campaign, the UPC soon found that they had a willing army of unemployed people who helped out in what ever way they could. They canvassed over 14,000 houses during the campaign. Teams of unemployed painters hand painted hundreds of posters and got their message across with very effective whitewash slogan writing. The campaign lifted the spirits of all involved as it gave them a feeling of hope and a sense of direction. The idea of unemployed people finally standing up and taking control of their own lives aroused great enthusiasm and support. Encouraging letters of support and subscriptions from well wishers began arriving at the Protest office in Derby Square, Dublin. One woman by the name of Elizabeth Faye typed thousands of letters on her portable typewriter every night after she'd put her children to bed.
With his trademark black beret and straight talking approach, Murphy proved a popular candidate. He emerged victorious with 3,036 votes thus becoming the first unemployed man ever elected to a national legislature. His seat was gained at the expense of the Labour Party who had fielded Roddy Connolly (son of James Connolly) as their candidate, though many Labour activists in the area campaigned for Murphy.
Murphy was considered an independent as he was not affiliated to any of the established political parties like Fianna Fáil, which won the majority of seats at the 1957 general election.
The 16th Dáil.
While many of his unemployed supporters considered the fact that Murphy had been elected as victory in itself, neither they nor Murphy had anticipated the task he faced inside the Dáil. His maiden speech was greeted by sneers and sniggers from the professional politicians in the Dáil and set the scene for what was to follow. The suspicion and disdain with which Murphy was regarded with by established parliamentary members meant that initially he could not get answers to even to the most basic of his queries – such as how much unemployment relief money was to be spent in Dublin. In contrast, the same politicians had no problem in addressing trivial concerns like those raised by Fine Gael's Jack Belton when he asked about the "hardship imposed on cricket clubs because of the cost of cricket balls".
Despite this, over his term, Murphy stubbornly persisted and used every opportunityto ignite serious consideration within the Dáil on questions surrounding poverty, emigration and unemployment assistance. He also used his vote in protest to remind the established parties of their pre-election promises; as exemplified by his statement on 20 March 1957 in opposition to the election of the Fianna Fáil leader Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach:I do not propose to support the nomination of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach, despite the fact that Deputy de Valera has publicly stated that his first task will be to solve unemployment. I have heard these promises before and my presence here is a symbol of broken promises and should be taken as a warning that emigration and unemployment will no longer be suffered in silence. This election proves that the people have given Fianna Fáil the task of solving unemployment. I realise that that problem will not be solved in a few weeks and that any Government should be given an opportunity of putting its programme into effect. I will support fully any scheme which will reduce unemployment and emigration. I hope my simple statement will be met with understanding, both inside and outside the House.
Murphy did not limit his role to criticism. He also made suggestions for new projects which could create jobs
"In view of the fact that there is still widespread unemployment in the building industry, would the Taoiseach consider taking more drastic measures to bring about a revival of house building? In Dublin City, we have no concert hall, no proper Houses of Parliament and we need more modern municipal buildings. The country needs these things very badly and they would give much-needed employment to building workers. I speak, Sir, with a sense of urgency which springs from looking at unfortunate men trying to survive in present conditions."
On occasion he also attempted to force votes on issues he was concerned with, such as the motion for increasing assistance to the unemployed on 25 March 1958:
"I wish to state that I am appalled at the callous indifference of the Parliamentary Secretary... The statement that there is no money to give these unfortunate people a further increase will be regarded by decent Christian people as a downright lie. I am still convinced that, with any kind of honest effort, the lot of the poorer sections of our people could be improved. The unemployed and the old age pensioners will continue to press for elementary Christian justice. I have asked, and I now repeat my request, for a free vote of the House on this issue."
Despite his best efforts it quickly became obvious that his perceived status within the Dáil as a "street politician" meant he was seen as a threat to the established order. Established politicians were more concerned with the votes he had taken away from existing political dynasties than the national issues he was trying to address. When he not being strategically ignored within the Dáil he was under attack from the members of the house, as demonstrated by Fine Gael's Stephen Barrett, who on 12 June 1957 declared the UPC (and therefore Murphy himself) part of "a new communist assault" on Ireland.
As a result, Murphy made little headway in the political process within the Dáil. In the end he admitted in despair that "I found that Leinster House was more a centre of political activity and useless talk than a place where plans could be made to ease the lot of the unfortunate".
Hunger strike.
Murphy's troubles were greatly multiplied once the new Fianna Fáil government's budget was revealed to be a particularly severe one, and including planning for the ending of food subsidies which was going to hit his support base of the unemployed and low paid workers particularly hard. Murphy later said: "In my time in the Dáil and even before that, I was in many of their unemployed homes. I saw hunger and misery, ill-nourished children and despairing parents. That is still continuing. I knew when the 'famine budget' of 1957 was brought in that their position would be worsened."
Murphy tried first to oppose the impending budget within the Dáil. In his statement of 15 May 1957 he contrasted the budget sharply with the unfilled pre-election promises of Fianna Fáil : "On behalf of my unemployed colleagues, I want to make it quite clear that we are opposed completely to this Budget, firstly, because it does nothing to relieve unemployment and there is no indication of any plans by the Government to bring about increased employment. In fact, this Budget will worsen the unemployment position by reducing the purchasing power of the people. Secondly, we are opposed to it because it inflicts a greater hardship on the suffering unemployed, old age pensioners, widows and the lower income groups. The demands of the unemployed are quite simple and realistic: that the Government should immediately take what measures it intends taking to alleviate unemployment. We do not want merely words and paper proposals; we want action based on concrete proposals."
However given the majority that Fianna Fáil enjoyed within the government, Murphy realised that even if he could force a vote on the budget he would inevitably lose and so further debate on the issue would serve little purpose but to waste time.
He next tried to put pressure on the government to scale back the proposed cuts via "people power", stating "the unemployed are a force to be reckoned with. Flesh and blood, not just something the statistician jumbles around with.", he began mobilising supporters to stage a series of high profile street demonstrations. To escalate things further, along with two other members of the UPC (Tommy Kavanagh and Jimmy Byrne) Murphy began a hunger strike in opposition to the budget. Each evening they addressed thousands of supporters who assembled at protest meetings in Dublin at the corner of Abbey Street and O'Connell Street.
The hunger strikers initially garnered much support from trade unions. Against this background a series of one day industrial strikes and actions against the government became a real possibility. However, on the fourth day of the protest, after winning the small concession from the Government with the announcement that it would reintroduce controls on the price of bread, it was decided to end the hunger strike. The ending of the hunger strike meant organised industrial strike action was no longer considered possible.
Resignation.
Realising he could not stand against the proposed budget on his own in the Dáil and that the demonstrations on the streets were not having the desired political impact, Murphy then tried another approach by contacting established society figures in an effort to garner support to lobby against the cuts.
Unfortunately he made the (fatal) mistake of attempting to enlist the aid of the powerful and conservative Catholic Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid. McQuaid eventually did meet with Murphy alone but instead of providing any assistance to the embattled TD he began to put pressure on Murphy to break with the UPC on the basis that communists were using him via the committee. McQuaid's official response to his meeting with Murphy was that he could not interfere in political decisions – an announcement which flew in the face of his actions the previous year when he publicly dictated to the previous Government over the ill-fated Mother and Child Scheme. Shortly afterwards McQuaid formally denounced the unemployment movement – a move which at a single stroke ended the possibility of Murphy enlisting any support from other church figures or from any other high profile individuals.
In addition to such major public reversals, Murphy also faced with a growing dissatisfaction at the lack of political progress coming from supporters. Moreover he was by now being forced to defend against pressure coming from within the ranks of the UPC itself for him to take a more left-leaning agenda.
Murphy himself had been adamant since the beginning that the UPC had been formed solely to spotlight the issues of emigration and unemployment in Ireland and therefore was never intended to be "a political entity as such" – but its surprise election success had attracted many new supporters, not all of whom shared his views. Once Murphy had been elected to Leinster House, he became largely removed from the day to day operations of the committee. Without his stewardship the UPC itself had become increasingly dominated by other individuals who saw the UPC not as he did, as a vehicle solely dedicated to highlighting emigration/unemployment issues, but rather as a potentially viable platform for wider agendas and sweeping political change in Ireland. Their repeated attempts to influence Murphy to promote their agenda – and his steadfast refusal to do the same – meant that the UPC meetings became characterised by growing friction, with clashes between the highly charged-political committee and the increasingly marginalised Murphy becoming more common.
Under severe strain and personal attack from all sides Murphy thus began to disassociate himself from UPC activities. In August 1957 he formally broke with the committee. Ultimately, less than a year later, on Saturday 13 May 1958 he yielded to the mounting pressure and resigned his seat in protest at the indifference of the main political parties to the plight of the unemployed. The subsequent by-election was won by Patrick Cummins of Fianna Fáil.
Of his resignation Murphy later stated: "I was fed up with the callous indifference of the big parties to the situation of the workers. I resigned as a protest against appalling indifference of those parties to the unemployed... When Mr de Valera was nominated for Taoiseach, I opposed him because he had broken his promise on unemployment and emigration. I told the house that my presence there was a symbol of broken promises. I said that I would support any scheme to put an end to mass unemployment and emigration. But in my 15 months in the Dáil, no-one put forward such a scheme."
Emigration to Canada.
Immediately following his resignation as a TD, Murphy, now once again unemployed, discovered to his dismay that as a result of his cards not being stamped during his time in office he was no longer eligible for full assistance and was reduced to living on the meagre sum of £2 1 shilling per week for his entire family. Faced with this situation he reluctantly made the decision to emigrate to Canada in 1959. He stated "Since Christmas I have been unable to get any work, apart from a couple of weeks. The building trade is finished. But there is plenty of work if only the Government would put up the money for it instead of putting millions into the purchase of jet planes. Irish tradesmen have emigrated in thousands. And they will continue to go. There is no hope for them here. Many people will say that I am quitting, pulling out in failure. But mostly they will be people with good, solid jobs. IF I SAW THE SLIGHTEST HOPE, I WOULD STAY. I REPEAT THAT. But it broke my heart to see my wife trying to get along on a few shillings a week."
Canada.
Following his resignation, Murphy emigrated to Saskatchewan, Canada, where his sister Molly and her husband Micheal Durnin lived. Once he arrived he set about seeking employment but carpentry work in Saskatchewan at that time was hard to get. In January 1960 he was visited by another Dublin man from Francis St named Joe Johnston who at the time was in the Canadian Armed Forces, Signal Corps. Johnston had just been posted to Regina after a large winter army exercise near Alberta, he heard about an Irish family who were living in Regina and tracked them down. He says "The first time I met Jack, I was shocked to find him and his family living in a small 1 bedroom shack without heating buried under huge snow drifts. It was bitterly cold and their situation was grim. It turns out that while Jack had managed to get some work as a carpenter with a company called "Sash And Door" during the Spring, he had been laid off in the winter due to the seasonal nature of Canadian construction (which of course he hadn't been aware of before his arrival)". Johnston noted wryly at the time that despite Murphy's emigration to Canada ""It seemed things were going from bad to worse for Jack, and he was just as unemployed in Regina as he had been in Dublin".
However despite these initial difficulties, Murphy eventually did find part-time work in carpentry. His woodworking skills were ably demonstrated by a detailed carving he did for a Sergeant Stankey of the Canadian Army NCO's mess which he was introduced to by Johnston. Thanks to this and other jobs he did for members of the same establishment, Murphy was eventually voted in as an associate member. Johnston recalled later "Being an associate member of the NCO's mess was a much sought after honour in that region. It was quite funny to me at the time, although not to some others who voted against us, that Jack (who was after all a convicted republican) was invited to be an associate member of an army mess. For his part, Jack made some notable contributions – some beautiful carvings – including one particular one I remember which had a maple leaf and shamrock intertwined which was proudly put by Stankey behind the bar on display".
"It's true Jack had a colourful past, but the great thing about Canada was that at that time they didn't hold sins committed in the "old world" against you. In the final analysis I think the most people there recognised right away that regardless of his political background Jack was an honest man, with an excellent work ethic and a real craftsman who held his own work and that of others to very high standards. In fact once word got out about his experience and skills, he became very much sought after by the staff and regulars alike because of his first rate advice on any building project or maintenance of houses. And of course he was a terrific speaker and debater, and unlike many he was good company no matter on which side of the political debate you stood. So despite the stiff initial opposition to him from some quarters, eventually everyone came around and he became very popular."
Murphy made a number of other friends while in Regina including Al Thompson, who was from a very old famous building company family, and was married into the Lavery family who had very strong attachments to Ireland. He was also a friend of Arthur Lavery who later returned to Ireland and became a solicitor. After a number of years, due to homesickness, Murphy returned with his family to Ireland as the economic situation in his native country had improved and there was more opportunities for work than existed in 1959 when emigration was at its peak.
Return to Ireland.
Jack Murphy returned to Ireland with his family in 1964. He lived for a short spell in Dublin's York Street before moving out to the suburbs of Coolock, on the north side of Dublin City. He continued working as a carpenter on various building sites around Dublin. His last place of employment was at Cadburys in Coolock. He worked there until 1982 when he took ill. He died on 11 July 1984, aged 64 years.
Accusations.
In the wake of his resignation and emigration to Canada, Murphy became a convenient scape-goat and was pilloried by established politicians, rivals and even certain former supporters. Indeed for the remainder of his life he endured an unrelentingly hostile and negative campaign from many quarters which attempted to put an unfavourable "spin" on both his intentions and his actions as a TD. He later responded to several of the chief accusations laid against him in the article "Why I left Ireland" as told to Jim Flanagan which was published in "The Sunday Review" on 29 March 1959.
One accusation is he used his influence as a TD to cheat the system and assist supporters. However Murphy himself stated emphatically to Jim Flanagan in this article how he was careful to avoid abusing his influence as a TD. For example he refused to get jobs for people, as other TDs both before and after him did as a matter of course, rather electing to help people via existing support structures: "I did what I could, for they were all my friends... there was far too much place hunting, [however as far as I could I helped those who were in trouble, mainly through the labour exchange."
Another allegation of note which was circulated against Murphy after his emigration to Canada was that over the fifteen months he worked as a TD he had secretly hoarded large amounts of money from his monthly salary at the expense of his supporters and then "ran off to Canada with a fortune". This accusation is evidently disproved by even the most cursory examination of Murphy's later status and circumstance. Immediately following his resignation he was once again unemployed and in a move contrary to his own avowed principles and stated desires he was forced to emigrate due to a combination of a lack of funds and being blacklisted by employers for being too political. His subsequent dire initial situation in Canada, his continued lack of money upon his return to Ireland, and the telling fact that he worked for the remainder of his life in factories and building sites as a carpenter until his premature death all clearly demonstrate daily financial struggle. Moreover, during his time in office, articles of the period saluted Murphy for distributing the majority of his salary in donations to families in distress and old persons in dire poverty – with he himself drawing from his parliamentary pay no more than the equivalent salary of a qualified carpenter.
Other charges later laid against Murphy take the form of more direct ad hominem attacks. There were several examples of these, most notably those catalogued in "The Communist Party of Ireland, A Critical History, Part 3" which bewails Murphy's "political inexperience" along with implied egotism behind the assertion that he resigned and emigrated because he could "neither act as Dáil mouthpiece for or national leader of the movement". This article attributes an egotism to Murphy which is notably absent in any other recorded sources. Indeed independent articles of the day (that is written and published by neither the UPC nor its associates) refer to Murphy as "quite free from personal vanity or presumption" and speak of his "honesty, integrity and sincerity". In addition on no occasion did Murphy ever seek, or claim, "leadership" of the unemployed or any other movement – on the contrary it is very noticeable that in both his own published writings and in his speeches to the Dáil he very seldom refers to himself at all (preferring to talk in terms of "we, the unemployed") but whenever he does speak of himself in first person, he referred to himself as merely a "representative" of the unemployed.
A final accusation made against Murphy "in absentia" after his emigration was that he resigned and left Ireland because he was not up to the task of solving the emigration and unemployment issues or that he reneged on promises to do the same. In fact Murphy himself explicitly stated at the time of his election that he never intended to solve the unemployment crises. Instead he specifically says that his sole purpose in the Dáil is to allow the unemployed voice their concern and put pressure on the political parties in government to make good on election promises to address these critical issues: "We shall continue to focus the plight of the unemployed in Dáil Éireann by our representation, who was not put there to solve this scourge of unemployment, but to put added pressure on the political parties who have it in their power to bring about some measure of relief to the unemployed and to ensure the future of the employed."
Jack Murphy's repeated his efforts to bring these same urgent national issues to debate in the Dáil during his term. The numerous recorded speeches he made during his term in office show his integrity, sincerity and the commitment he had to fulfilling his promise to highlighting the plight of the unemployed – a commitment which ultimately exacted a heavy toll on both his own health and his family.
"I tried hard all along and no one can say that I did not try to spot-light the problems and evils of our country."

Description.
Route 396 is a two-lane highway which winds through the hills of Western Tōno, eastern Hanamaki, eastern Shiwa and enters southern Morioka following the Kitakami River. In the steeper hills of Hanamaki and Tōno, there are generous passing lanes on the uphill stretches going both ways. 
In Shiwa, there are fruit and vegetable stands in season along the roadside and several excellent restaurants can be found in and close to Morioka. On the Tōno end 396 passes the Chiba Family Farmhouse. There is a tunnel approximately one kilometer long in Tōno under the Kotōge Pass.
Intersections.
In Tōno, Route 396 begins at National Route 283 in Ayaori. In the Miyamori section of Tōno, there is an intersection with Prefectural Roads 160 and 161. 161 leads to the northeast through Tsukimoushi and 160 leads southwest over the Tase Dam. 
In Hanamaki, Route 396 intersects with Prefectural Road 43 at two different places in Ohasama and shares about a half kilometer of roadway. 43 South leads to Towa while 43 North leads to Lake Hayachine. There is also an intersection with Prefectural Road 102 which goes to Ishidoriya.
In Shiwa, Route 396 intersects with Prefectural Road 228 which joins National Route 456. 396 crosses Prefectural Road 25 near the Shiwa Road Station. 25 West leads to central Shiwa and 25 east leads to Lake Hayachine after a winding and torturous ascent of Arikabe Toge Pass.
In Morioka, Route 396 joins Prefectural Road 208 in two places. 208 West crosses National Route 4 and leads to Yahaba Station. There is also an intersection with Prefectural Road 36. 36 East leads to National Route 106 while 36 West crosses route 4 and leads to the Morioka Minami Interchange of the Tōhoku Expressway.

Losing It

Citizens Band radio in India

Citizens' Band radio (also known as CB radio) is a system of short-distance radio communications between individuals on a selection of 40 channels within the 27-MHz (11 m) band. Citizens' Band is distinct from the Family Radio Service, GMRS, Multi-Use Radio Service and amateur radio (Ham). In many countries CB operation does not require a license, and (unlike amateur radio) it may be used for business or personal communications. Like many other two-way radio services, any Citizens' Band channel is shared by many users. Only one station may transmit in a channel at a time; other stations must listen and wait for the shared channel to be available. Also, the system works in half-duplex mode, which means we may transmit and receive information, but not both at the same time.
Regulation in India.
The channel assignments in India are different from the band plans used elsewhere. The Indian band plan consists of 40 frequencies spaced a relatively tight eight kHz apart, plus a few offset channels used for mountaineering and radio-controlled devices. Many of the channels are reserved for specific purposes such as forestry, disaster relief, and sporting events.
The frequency band allocated for this purpose in India is 26.957-27.283 MHz. Nonetheless, the effective radiating power used for Citizens Band is limited within 5 Watt in India.
Popular use.
Citizens Band radio is a good option for long-haul truck drivers to communicate directions, traffic problems and other relevant matters.

DRG Class 04

The two German Class 04 steam locomotives were experimental engines with the Deutsche Reichsbahn, that were derived from the Class 03 standard locomotives ("Einheitsloks"). 
History.
In 1932 the Deutsche Reichsbahn tried to raise boiler overpressures from by using high-tensile steel. These vehicles, built by the firm of Krupp, soon showed signs of damage on the firebox however. Because the engines did not meet expectations even after modification and repairs, in 1935 the pressure was reduced to again and they were given operating numbers 02 101 and 02 102. Due to a lack of water the boiler on 02 101 exploded on 3 April 1939; after that both engines were retired and eventually scrapped in 1940.
The engines were equipped with a 2'2' T 32 standard tender.

Charles Scribner IV

Charles Scribner IV (July 13, 1921 - November 11, 1995), also known as Charles Scribner, Jr., was the head of the Charles Scribner's Sons publishing company. He was a resident of Manhattan for most of his adult life, establishing a residence in the upper east side area after 1945, when he was twenty-four.
Biography.
He was born in Quogue, New York on July 13, 1921 to Vera Gordon Bloodgood and Charles Scribner III and was raised in Far Hills, New Jersey.
He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire for secondary school. He was graduated from Princeton University in 1943, receiving his A.B. degree, summa cum laude. Nine members of his family, over six generations, have been graduates of Princeton.
He was a Navy cryptanalyst during World War II and the Korean War.
He succeeded his father, Charles Scribner III, in 1952 as chief of Charles Scribner's Sons, which had been founded by his great-grandfather, Charles Scribner I, in 1846. He oversaw the operations until 1984, when the company was bought out by Macmillan Publishing.
He was a charter trustee of Princeton University from 1969 to 1979. He was a trustee of the Princeton University Press from 1949 to 1981, also serving as its president from 1957 to 1968. He was president of the American Book Publishers Council from 1966 to 1968.
He died on November 11, 1995 at the Mary Manning Walsh nursing home on York Avenue in Manhattan.
Authorship.
In his book "In the Company of Writers", Charles Scribner discusses the publication of "The Secret River" by Marjorie Rawlings, noting that Rawlings never mentions the race of the character, Calpurnia. Since the book went into production after her death, Rawlings could not be consulted about her final intentions. At this time the depiction of black children in American children's literature had decreased, until it was almost non-existent.
While a few books were still appearing, "White (children's) publishers were still not open to books with Black themes", according to Joyce Braden Harris on "African and African-American Traditions in Language Arts". Scribner pointed out that "Whatever our decision, we could land on the wrong side of the school boards", and claims it was his idea to use dark paper in the book as a way to suggest Calpurnia's race, calling it "one of my silent contributions to dissolving the color barrier in the 1950s." The book received a Newbery Honor Award in 1956 for "the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children", and was honored by the American Society of Graphic Arts.

John Nutt (printer)

Elizabeth Nutt ("c." 1666 – November 1746) and John Nutt (? – 1716) were printers and booksellers and distributors in London in the early 18th century. John Nutt's most famous publication was the first three editions of Jonathan Swift's "A Tale of a Tub", but he and Elizabeth were important both as publishers and sellers of many works of English law and literature.
John Nutt remains an obscure individual, with only his death well attested in 1716. Elizabeth Carr married John Nutt in 1692, and she was at that time already a practicing "mercury," or seller of newspapers and pamphlets. Independent of her husband, she is referred to as a significant and honest seller by John Dunton in 1705. She therefore brought a retailing business to the marriage, and John brought a printing house. The couple lived in the Savoy off of the Strand in London for nearly all of their adult lives, and they sold books, pamphlets, and news sheets by the Royal Exchange. 
John Nutt had a shop in the Savoy at least by 1705, when he published Swift's first major satire the year before (1703/4 and 1704). That same year, he obtained an exclusive patent to print law books. When John Nutt died in 1716, Elizabeth took over the printing business and had her son, Richard, manage the presses, and Richard took over the publication of legal writings in 1722. Elizabeth also worked with Anne Dodd, the most famous distributor of books of the day. She would print books and sell them to Dodd for retail sale, as well as sell them in her own stalls.
The Nutts were allied with tory and general opposition causes during the Hanoverian period, and she and her family were arrested for selling "The London Evening-Post," which Richard Nutt published, "The Craftsman," and "Mist's Weekly Journal". Nevertheless, Elizabeth and her family prospered and extended their ownership of news shops, stalls, and book sellers. Her name continued to appear as a printer on imprints to 1741, and she is listed as a book seller until her death in 1746.

Sabar people

The Sabar people (also Shabar and Saora) are one of the scheduled tribes in India who live mainly in Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal. During the British Raj, they were classed as one of the 'criminal tribes' under Criminal Tribes Act 1871, and still suffer from social stigma and ostracism in modern times.
Also known as Saora, the Sabar tribe finds mention in the Hindu epic Mahabharata, while in some parts of East Singhbhum district mainly in Musabani, they are known as in Kariya. Noted writer and activist Mahasweta Devi is known for working with these forest tribals.
This reclusive tribe is found primarily in East Singhbhum district in Jharkhand and in Midnapore District of West Bengal.
The traditionally forest-dwelling tribe lack experience in agriculture, and rely on the forests for their livelihood. In recent years, with the spread of the Naxalite rebellion in the area, the police often restrict their access to the forest. In 2004, five persons in the Sabar village of Amlasole, in Midnapore district, died after several months of starvation, 
In June 2008, the Sabar suffered severe flooding in many of their West Bengal villages, and then received large amounts of aid from Catholic missionaries.

God's Step Children

"God's Step Children" is a 1938 American drama film directed by Oscar Micheaux and starring Jacqueline Lewis. The movie is inspired by a combination of elements shared from two previous released Hollywood productions: "Imitation of Life" and "These Three".
Plot.
A young black woman arrives at the home of a black widow, Mrs. Saunders, and begs her to look after her light-skinned baby, whom she cannot afford to feed. At first she says this is temporary while she looks for work, but as she leaves she declares she will never be back. Mrs. Saunders pledges to raise the "poor little darling" as her own, alongside her own son Jimmie. She names her Naomi.
Nine years later, schoolgirl Naomi is thought by the other black children to be aloof; they accuse the light-complexioned child of not wanting to be black. This looks true the day Naomi disappears on her way to school and Jimmie tells his mother that Naomi deliberately avoided the black school she was supposed to attend and instead went to attend a white school. Naomi denies Jimmie's accusation, saying he's lying because he hates girls. When Mrs. Cushinberry threatens to punish her for being insolent and mean, Naomi furiously explodes that she hates her and the other children and that she only came to the school because her mother sent her there. She spits in the teacher's face which results in Mrs. Cushinberry spanking her. 
That evening, Mrs. Cushinberry visits Mrs. Saunders, but when she realizes that Naomi didn't tell her mother what happened that afternoon, she decides to keep silent. But Naomi has been eavesdropping, and when the teacher leaves she starts to tell her mother that the teacher was the one at fault. Then Jimmie reveals the truth: Naomi was spanked at school for being unruly and then spitting in the teacher's face. Mrs. Saunders spanks Naomi herself. Later, Naomi starts a rumor that Mrs. Cushinberry is having an affair with a married professor; soon a riot erupts at school and a crowd of angry parents marches to the school superintendent's house to demand that he fire both teachers. When Jimmie tells Mrs. Saunders about the riot, she rushes to the superintendent's office to dispel the rumor Naomi started. Because of this, Naomi is soon sent to a convent.
About 12 years later, Jimmie has earned $6700 as a Pullman porter and he is approached by Ontrue Cowper, who tries to interest him in investing in the numbers racket. Jimmie rejects this offer, investing in a farm instead. After proposing to his sweetheart Eva, Jimmie invites his mother to live on his new farm. Naomi returns to town, reformed by her life at the convent, and apologizes to her mother for having been a bad child. When Jimmie and Naomi are reunited, the scene implies Naomi's romantic attachment towards him. Mrs. Saunders arranges to have Jimmie take Naomi to see the city. Although things go well, Eva's Aunt Carrie doesn't trust Naomi's unnatural interest in Jimmie and believes that she should be watched. 
Aunt Carrie’s suspicions prove to be well-founded as Naomi soon confesses her love for her adoptive brother. When Jimmie, Eva, and Naomi return to the country, Jimmie introduces Naomi to his friend, Clyde Wade, who immediately falls in love with her. Clyde is a dark-skinned African American with a country accent. Naomi finds him repulsive and confesses to Jimmie that she has always wanted him to marry her. Realizing that Eva would be crushed by the loss of Jimmie, Naomi consents to marry Clyde. One year later, Naomi tells her mother that she is leaving Clyde and her newborn son and is also “leaving the Negro race.” A few years after that, Naomi comes back to the farm one night and silently creeps up to the window, through which she sees a happy family scene that will never include her. After getting one last look at her family, Naomi drowns herself in the river.
Production.
The above summary reflects details of the re-edited version of the movie as details from its original version are presented in the "American Film Institute Catalog" entry. It reports that original material was cut from the film after censors objected. Some of the cut scenes featured more insight on child Naomi's hatred towards black people and wanting to be white. Other footage includes adult Naomi with a white husband after she decides to pass for white (at the climax of the movie) only to be rejected by him when he finds out about her black heritage. Some of the removed footage however can still be seen in the movie's opening preview trailer. The film's script was based on a short treatment titled "Naomi Negress!," written by Alice B. Russell, wife of director Oscar Micheaux and the actress who plays Mrs. Saunders. It is reported that the film's racial characterizations were objected to by protesters from the Young Communist Committee.
Critical debates.
"God's Step Children" has both been hailed as a masterpiece and denounced as stereotypical and racially denigrating. Patrick McGilligan provides a good summary of the film's reception and of arguments over whether it favors light-skinned characters. Protests at the time of the film's release apparently targeted scenes and dialogue in which Micheaux repeated his long-standing criticisms of the "race," charging it with a lack of ambition and an inability to plan. As in previous Micheaux films, "God's Step Children" seems to repeat the very bias in favor of light-skinned blacks that the movie also tries to critique. The "bad" blacks, such as the gamblers, are dark-complexioned. Clyde, whom Naomi rejects, is also dark and speaks in a buffoonish country accent. It is difficult to reconcile the film's praise for Clyde's industriousness with this caricature, and difficult to criticize Naomi's rejection of him, though she is obviously prejudiced against him largely because of his appearance. The film does not engage current social-political issues as forcefully as earlier Micheaux movies, such as "Within Our Gates" or "Symbol of the Unconquered", and thus it is a challenge to rank it in equal importance to those works.
Although it is never explicitly stated, some viewers have speculated that Naomi's biological mother (who was played by Dorothy Van Engle), gave birth to the even lighter complexioned Naomi as a result of an affair with a white man. Such a parentage might explain why Naomi's mother was unable to live in African American communities as a respectable working mother
(and therefore unable to keep Naomi with her), since illegitimacy, compounded with the race issue, would have been very heavy burdens in America during the 1930s Great Depression era. This interpretation may also lead viewers to the conclusion that Naomi was unwanted/rootless from her moment of birth or conception. An alternate interpretation is that Naomi's mother was herself the product of such a liaison and wanted a better fate for her own child, thinking Naomi would be better off raised by the light-complexioned widow, Mrs. Saunders. A combination of these views may provide a richer understanding of the film.

Niagara College Teaching Winery

The Niagara College Teaching Winery (NCT), Canada’s first commercial teaching winery, is located at the Niagara-on-the-Lake Campus of Niagara College within the Niagara Region of Ontario. Situated in the heart of Niagara wine country, the NCT is the centre for applied wine education for the Canadian wine industry. Officially opened in November 2002, the winery began production in 2001. With three on-site teaching and research vineyards, Winery and Viticulture students are taught the day-to-day responsibilities and inner workings of a winery, from planting grapes to selling wine. Students form teams dedicated to making a specific variety of wine. The Wine Business Management program provides students expertise in the business, retail, marketing and export aspects of the growing wine industry. 
The facility operates strictly on a non-profit, cost recovery basis with all revenue from sales re-invested into the winery program. 
The campus is enveloped in an ecological band of wetlands, vineyards at the base of the Niagara Escarpment, a World Biosphere Reserve, becoming a living laboratory for the programs. With of production vineyards plus the Jack Forrer teaching and demonstration vineyard, the winery provides students with practical, hands-on training that prepares them for the workplace. 
Programs.
Wine Industry Seminars and Workshops
Niagara College Teaching Winery hosts various wine industry seminars and workshops. These workshops help to broaden knowledge and give training in related areas.
Wine Sensory Laboratory.
Completed in April 2007, the wine sensory lab enhances the training of students enrolled in wine and viticulture, sommelier, culinary and hospitality and tourism programs. With 40 wine-tasting stations, recessed light tables and sinks, the theatre-style lab is designed to provide the appropriate physical and technical resources to assess and appreciate wine. The lab also includes a smaller, more traditional wine-tasting room often found at Ontario's wineries.
Events.
The Niagara College Teaching Winery and its students participate in events around the country and the world. Annual Events include:
Icewine.
NCT students experience the Icewine harvest first hand. With vineyards right on campus, students are called to pick the grapes when the optimum temperatures are reached. Students work through each step of the Icewine process from the vine right through the crush and up to the point of bottling. Many students are from foreign countries and distant areas of Canada and are proud to be part of making one of Canada's most internationally renowned products. Each year NCT Winery produces different varieties of Icewine, giving the students diverse knowledge of different styles. 
NCT Icewines are available at the Icewine gala, Icewine Festival and in the NCT Winery’s own wine store during the month of January.
Awards.
NCT Winery has won more than 60 national and international awards for its VQA wines since its inception.

Data &amp; Analysis Center for Software

The Data & Analysis Center for Software (DACS) is one of several United States Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored Information Analysis Centers (IACs), administered by the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). It is technically managed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and currently operated by Quanterion Solutions Inc. under a long term DoD contract.
DACS is chartered to collect, analyze, and disseminate information relating to the software domain to the DoD Software Engineering community, which includes Defense contractors and the academic community as well. DACS serves as an information broker, identifying resources that exist within the global community and making those resources available to the community through outreach venues such as an information rich web site, technical reports, technical journals and a variety of services offered free of charge.
Additionally, DACS, like all DTIC managed IACs, is a contract vehicle that serves the DoD by expediting the process for DoD components to acquire the services of commercial and academic providers to accomplish technical area tasks.
DACS Mission, Charter and History.
DACS Mission and Charter.
The mission of DACS, like the other IACs in the DTIC IAC Program, is:
DACS receives its authority to operate from the following DoD Directives and Instructions, which constitute the IAC Charter.
History.
How long has DACS existed?
The DACS was established in the late 1970s. The software community, at that time, recognized the need for data and information about computer software, its development process and the software technology area in general. The rapid expanison of software engineering technology and the proliferation of tools and techniques made it difficult for an individual or organization to remain cognizant of the current status of the software engineering field. This situation resulted in the duplication of efforts in software research and seriously hampered the transfer of technology from the software research environment to the user sector of the software community.
Recognizing the need for an information analysis center to serve the government, industrial, and university community as a focal point for software development and experience data, in August 1978 the Rome Air Development Center (RADC), which is now called the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), contracted with IIT Research Institute (IITRI) to design such a center, named, The Data and Analysis Center for Software (DACS), that would acquire, analyze, synthesize, and disseminate information on software engineering technology.
The decision was based in part on the fact that the DoD and other Federal Agencies found that the establishment of special purpose information analysis centers and technology transfer programs were effective in overcoming problems int echnology implementation and diffusion of mission-oriented developments. NASA was cited as an example for demonstrating a benefit-to-cost ratio in excess of ten to one for its Technology Utilization Program. At that time the DoD had already been successful in operating Information Analysis Centers for Metals, Ceramics, Hardware Reliability, and Machineability data.
What was the original purpose of the DACS?
DACS initially functioned as the DoD librarian for software related topics. The objectives were to: 
How has DACS evolved over time?
Since its inception, DACS has been operated by various Defense contractors over the years and the library, and other resources constituting the DACS collection, have migrated to each contractor in turn. The objectives are essentially the same but the terminology used to define them has evolved as the software environment has changed. The means for improving the 'transfer of software engineering technology' now centers around use of web technology to deliver information to the mass community in electronic format, organized in ways that make it easy for the community to acquire and use the information.
Why The DACS Is Notable.
DTIC and the DTIC IAC program are notable. The DACS is an IAC. Some DACS products are gaining recognition.
Some DACS reports have been published in peer-reviewed journals and collections. Some DACS work is referenced in the professional literature. For example, Warren Harrison et al. and Raffo et al. cite both Vienneau and Thomas McGibbon, the DACS Program Manager. Rini van Solingen cites McGibbon. David F. Rico acknowledges Thomas McGibbon for "inspirational" work that has "been critical to the formation of concepts in this book". Hossam A. Gabbar and Almstrum et al. cite Vienneau. Michael R. Lyu cites a DACS implementation of the Goel-Okumoto software reliability model, distributed by the DACS at the time.
Additional evidence of the effectiveness and outreach of DACS products and services is contained in a DTIC Success Story which describes the significance of a DACS core effort in providing value-added analysis in its synopsis and overview of a General Accountability Office (GAO) report, resulting in the subsequent use of that material by members of the defense community and software industry, as well as extending the usefulness and outreach of the original GAO report in both time and scope beyond two years. The DACS article providing the synopsis of the GAO report was published in the July 2005 issue of the DACS "Software Tech News"
DACS Products and Services.
In fulfillment of its charter, DACS engages in a continuous cycle of data and information collection, analysis, and dissemination. DACS adds value for the community by the manner in which it organizes and disseminates or otherwise packages information to make it accessible to the broadest spectrum of community members. Thus collection and dissemination are tightly integrated. DACS maintains an information rich web site, produces a quarterly technical journal, and periodically, develops State-Of-The-Art Reports (SOARs) on various software engineering topics in addition to focused research such as the ROI initiative and the Gold Practice initiative. The paragraphs below provide details about specific products and services.
DACS Web Site.
The primary means of dissemination is via the DACS web site. There, DACS presents information organized around the key software related research areas or topics. Each research area is further organized into content-specific subtopics and information categories. Visitors to a topic area can navigate among the categories to get the type of information desired. Information categories include (but are not limited to) literature, best practices, case sudies and lessons learned, education and training resources, subject matter experts, glossaries and acronyms, blogs and other interactive venues for software topics, programs and organizations, service providers and consultants, tools, and other related resources. Subtopics provide greater coverage of the main topic as well as addressing a specific perspective, enabling the visitor to quickly navigate to the desired level of detail.
Some of the research topics included on the web site are: Software Acquisition, Software Architecture, Agile Software Development,Software Best Practices, Collaborative Software Engineering, Configuration Management, 
From the web site registered DACS users can search DACS databases, including:
DACS Software Tech News.
DACS publishes a quarterly technical journal, called "The Software Tech News", which is distributed in printed and electronic format to registered DACS subscribers free of charge and also available for viewing and download from the DACS web site. Authors are solicited for their expertise or experience relative to a chosen theme. Recent themes have included:
DACS Publications.
DACS periodically produces technical reports on a variety of software engineering topics. In keeping with the DACS mission, most reports are made available to the software engineering community as free PDF downloads from the DACS web site. These documents are reporting on current research in the subject and are typically authored by subject matter experts. Some recent reports include:
Collaborative IAC Publications.
The software domain is not an isolated entity. There are many instances of overlap of software related subject matter with the domains of other IACs such as reliability, information assurance and modeling and simulation. For example, software reliability is a subtopic of the broader topic of system reliability. Software assurance is intertwined with the subject of Information Assurance. Software technology is a significant part of modeling and simulation.
Because of this natural overlap, DACS has collaborated with other IACs to jointly produce the following documents:
DACS Technical Inquiry Services.
As part of its outreach to address the needs of the software community, DACS provides a technical inquiry service, wherein it provides up to four hours of research, free of charge, to address any technical inquiry from any member of the DACS community. In some cases, DACS connects the inquirer directly with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to satisfy the request. DTIC, the organization that funds the DACS, regards the number of technical inquiries handled by DACS each month as a key performance metric for operation of the IAC. The scope of questions asked is very broad, ranging from simple questions asking for a definition of an acronym, to very complex questions. The following list contains some recent requests that convey the essence and scope of this service.
DACS Technical Area Tasks.
As is the case with all DTIC managed IACs, DACS serves as a contract vehicle that enables DoD components to acquire technical services from commercial providers (Defense contractors, small businesses, etc.) and academic institutions without having to engage in a formal competitive bid process. This saves time and resources for the government and enables awarding of a contract within a four to six week window. This IAC technical area task (TAT) service has the following characteristics which are beneficial to the government:
The efficiency of the TAT contracting process and its bypassing of a formal RFP process is premised on the business model of the DTIC IAC program. Specifically, contractors must compete for the opportunity to operate an IAC. This is a full open competition, and award is based on the capability of the contractor to perform software-aligned technical areas tasks, as well as to perform the core functions of maintaining software-focused libraries and developing a software center of excellence. When bidding on an IAC, contractors form collaborative teams to ensure the best overall coverage of the domain. Therefore, the contractor operating the DACS has already competed for the right for their team to perform TATs. The DACS contractor manages all TATs, insuring that any scientific and technical information (STI) resulting from the TAT is added to the DACS collection for dissemination in appropriate venues. When the government wishes to acquire the services of someone other than the DACS contractor, it is done as a TAT based on a subcontracting arrangement between the service provider (team member or other) and the DACS contractor. This business model gives the government a great deal of flexibility in working with DACS to acquire the services from the most qualified organizations. This is especially true in scenarios where the technical expertise needed resides within a small group in an academic institution, or a small business.
TATs cover a broad spectrum of activities within the software domain. The list below is included to communicate the range and types of activities performed under TATs.
DACS Initiatives.
As the software domain evolves and software technology surges, developers face significant challenges in meeting the requirements of these large complex systems of systems. DACS currently is engaged in some initiatives to provide the developers greater insight about software best practice and about improving their development process. Concurrently DACS is participating, along with the other IACs, in supporting a DTIC initiative to make more scientific and technical information available to the warfighter in electronic form. These initiatives are described in greater detail in the following sub-sections.
DACS Gold Practice Initiative.
This initiative, started in 2003, is focused on providing the software acquisition and software engineering communities with detailed information about prevalent software acquisition and development best practices that may have a positive impact on program risks and ROI. DACS is conducting extensive research on each identified practice and then publishing a technical document for each practice, that contains a detailed description of the practice or practice set, including the interrelationships among practices and an extensive lists of resources relating to that practice. The documents are available for viewing and download, free of charge, from the DACS Gold Practice web site. The document also identifies relevant web sites, tools and methods, experts, training opportunities, literature, terms, practice origins and recommending origins.
The initial set of practices which DACS has targeted for this initiative were first identified in the PhD dissertation of Dr. Richard Turner titled “Implementation of Best Practices in U.S. Department of Defense Software-Intensive System Acquisitions”.
The following practices can be downloaded from the DACS Gold Practice site:
DACS ROI Initiative.
This initiative has been ongoing since the late 1990s. Software Process Improvement (SPI) has received much attention in recent years; however, it has been very difficult to translate benefits achieved in one organization to another organization. This initiative is focused on accumulating data from SPI efforts, analyzing it, generalizing and modeling the cost benefits one can achieve from SPI efforts. In 1999 DACS produced a State of the Art Report (SOAR) titled "A Business Case for Software Process Improvement" and revised this report in 2007 to provide new insights into the details necessary to demonstrate from a business perspective the benefits of improved software management using SPI techniques. This revised SOAR examines the business implications of some more recent SPI practices, including the Capability Maturity Model for Integration(CMMI), agile development, and systems engineering.
The DACS has recently implemented a new capability called the "ROI Dashboard©", on the DACS web site to provide updated information about return-on-investment (ROI) results. The ROI Dashboard© also contains updated information for practices such as inspections, reuse, and secondary benefits. It establishes a framework whereby the current methods of performing software development can be compared to any proposed improvements, graphically displaying open and publicly available data and providing standard statistical analysis of the data.
Total Electronic Migration System (TEMS).
The Total Electronic Migration System is a project funded by DTIC to support the collection of scientific and technical information held in the IAC document collections and the subsequent dissemination of that information to a restricted DoD community through a sophisticated search capability. DACS, along with the other DTIC managed Information Analysis Centers, is collaborating with the TEMS initiative, by transforming to electronic format the documents within the DACS collection (DACS library) that exist currently only in printed format and uploading them to the database created by DTIC to support the TEMS effort. In many cases, the IACs are the single holders of valuable documents developed prior to 2000. This initiative preserves them and expands their outreach. Each IAC is transforming many thousands of documents to PDF format, making them more accessible to the IAC researchers as well as the TEMS. This initiative is ongoing although many IACs are still working on scanning the backlog of documents that existed in printed form only. For further details visit the TEMS web site and review the 'About TEMS' section.

Christopher Watts

Christopher Charles Watts (also rendered Charles Christopher Watts; 6 May 1877, Kensworth - July 1958) was an Anglican Bishop. Watts was the son of the Revd George Edward Oscar Watts, Vicar of Kensworth, Bedfordshire in England. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1899 and proceeding MA in 1904.
Career.
He was ordained deacon in 1900 and priest in 1901 by the Bishop of London, serving as curate of St. Mark's, Noel Park, London (St Mark's Website). In 1907 he went out to Southern Africa, and began work as Priest-in-charge of Mbabane in Swaziland in the diocese of Zululand, and headmaster of St. Mark's European School (until 1920), and St. Mark's Coloured School. In 1917 he was appointed Canon of St. Peter's Cathedral, Vryheid, KwaZulu-Natal, and from 1918 he served as Archdeacon of Swaziland.
He returned to England in 1927, to his old parish of St. Mark's, Noel Park, where he served as Vicar until 1929. In 1930 he assumed duties as Warden of Zonnebloem College, Cape Town. In 1931, however, he was chosen to be Bishop of St Helena, being consecrated as such in St. George's Cathedral, Cape Town, on St. Barnabas' Day, 11 June 1931 by the Archbishop of Cape Town, assisted by the Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman, and Bishop Williams. He was enthroned in St. Paul's Cathedral, St Helena, on 12 July 1931.
Watts served as Administrator of the diocese of Damaraland, in 1934-1935, and in 1935 was translated as second Lord Bishop to Damaraland. He resigned his diocese in December 1938, and returned to live in South Africa. He served as Rector of Victoria West with Carnarvon, in the diocese of Cape Town (1939-1940); and as Rector of Knysna (1940-1946); and Priest-in-charge of Riversdale (1946-1947), both in the diocese of George. He retired in 1947.

Turner and Nichols signed to BNA Entertainment (now known as BNA Records) in 1993 as the duo Turner Nichols. Their self-titled debut album was released that year, with two of its singles reaching the "Billboard" country charts. "Entertainment Weekly" reviewer Alanna Nash gave the album a "B" rating, noting the "soulful lyrics and real emotional connections" on cuts such as "Moonlight Drive-In", the first single. "Moonlight Drive-In" peaked at No. 51 on the "Billboard" country charts, and was followed by "She Loves to Hear Me Rock" at No. 49. These songs respectively reached No. 36 and No. 39 on the "RPM" Country Tracks charts in Canada.

<doc id="18570939" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18570939" title="Depopulation of cockroaches in post-Soviet states">
Depopulation of cockroaches in post-Soviet states

A mass depopulation of cockroaches has been observed since the beginning of the 21st century in Russia and other countries of the former USSR. Observers note quick disappearance of various types of cockroaches from cities and towns in Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus.
Rational explanations.
The depopulation of cockroaches may be exaggerated, or this phenomenon is temporary or cyclic. Usage of plastic bags to store domestic waste and the discontinuation of rubbish chutes usage may also be a factor. Also, cockroaches might have migrated out of homes to other, more suitable places. New, improved chemicals and methods to fight cockroaches may be a cause for alleged cockroach migration, or might be a factor of said depopulation.
Usage of modern construction materials may also contribute to the phenomenon; the population of cockroaches might have been reduced due to their purported ingestion of unsafe balls. However, cockroaches were noticed to disappear even in the houses where such construction materials were not used. Finally, the emergence of Pharaoh ants, who compete with the cockroaches for food, and may even feed on them may also be a factor. Of course, a "perfect storm" with several of these factors may be the reason why the cockroach population have decreased.
Other explanations.
The introduction of genetically modified food might have a negative influence on cockroaches. Radioactive or chemical pollution (in Chernovtsy, Tambov, as well as due to Chernobyl disaster) may also be a factor. However, there is an opinion that cockroaches are insensitive to radiation. Furthermore, widespread introduction of mobile phones and wireless networks might have a negative effect on the cockroaches.
Ozone holes may also lead to abnormal biorhythms in cockroaches. Internal competitions between cockroaches may decrease the number of cockroaches. Finally, some species of cockroaches are edible, which means that the cockroaches may be eaten by predators.
Scientific attention to the problem.
Scientists from Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg have suggested that the Oriental cockroach should be added to the Red Book of Endangered Species.

Robert L. Peters

Robert L. Peters, FGDC was born on May 26, 1954 (in Steinbach, Manitoba, Canada) to devout Mennonite missionary parents, the middle of three sons to survive infancy. His pacifist father (John Jacob Peters) was born in post-revolutionary Russia in 1920 (during the Russian Civil War amongst the White Army, Bolsheviks, and Makhnovist anarchists), narrowly escaping as a refugee émigré along with his nuclear family in 1926. (During the Second World War, John served Canada as a voluntary conscientious objector). Robert’s mother (Amanda Marie Peters Reimer—direct descendent of Klaas Reimer) was born in Manitoba in 1926 by dint of an earlier Russian Mennonite immigration to the Canadian prairies in 1874.
Robert’s family moved to Europe in 1957, where he grew up as a third culture kid, schooled bilingually in Frankfurt, Germany and Basel, Switzerland. Following a one-year foundation program in art (Basel), he graduated from Black Forest Academy (Lörrach), and then attended a year of religious studies at Capernwray Hall (Carnforth, Lancashire) in the United Kingdom. He subsequently volunteered with Operation Palmbranch, an African relief mission based in Bavaria, Germany.
Peters immigrated to Winnipeg, Canada in 1974, where he worked as an artist and freelance illustrator, married Beverly Guay Pauls (a Canadian he had met while studying in England), and studied design (a two-year Graphic Design diploma from Red River College, and a certificate in Design Management from the University of Manitoba, Faculty of Administrative Studies). In 1976 (while still in school) he co-founded the design studio Circle Graphics (now Circle Design Incorporated).
Under Peters’ direction (he remains active as the firm’s principal), Winnipeg-based Circle Design Incorporated (Circle) has helped hundreds of clients worldwide conceive effective strategies, implement distinctive corporate identities and brands, and deploy targeted information and communication tools. This work has been widely recognized and cited, has received more than 60 awards for design excellence, and may be found in numerous permanent collections. Of particular note are the dozens of Canadian postage stamps, first day of issue covers, and philatelic collectables that Circle has designed since 1998.
Since 1982 Peters has lived in an ultra-low-energy, passive solar house that he designed and built on a wooded acreage in Eastern Manitoba A lifelong conservationist and nature lover, Peters is also an avid rock climber and mountaineer (a certified Climbing Instructor with the Alpine Club of Canada), marathoner, canoeist, and outdoorsman. 
Peters separated in 1999 (after a 25-year marriage) and divorced in 2001. More biographical information about Robert L. Peters can be found at www.robertlpeters.com.
Professional Activities & Affiliations.
In addition to his work as a design strategist, practitioner, and consultant, Peters has been actively involved in design deontology, education, writing, speaking, organization, and professional advocacy throughout his career. In 1998 the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada named him a Fellow (the country’s highest professional standing in this field) in recognition for his work in professional development and international design advancement. 
Peters has traveled extensively (more than 60 countries) and continues to be active globally in professional development and as a frequent design juror, policy advisor, guest lecturer, and author. He is passionate about design’s role in making tomorrow’s world a better place—by shaping culture, building respect for diversity, and furthering understanding among people everywhere. An in-depth 2004 interview with Peters appears on Netdiver.
Peters first became actively involved with design associations in the late 1970s through his development and co-authorship of the pro forma guide document re: conditions of engagement for designers published by the multidisciplinary Manitoba Chapter of the Association of Canadian Industrial Designers (ACID/M). He served on the executive of ACID/M for several years, and was elected president in 1984.
In the late 1980s, Peters was among a handful of Manitoban designers who orchestrated the formation of a provincial chapter of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada. He became GDC Manitoba’s founding president (1990 to 1992), assisted in the formation of GDC chapters in Saskatchewan and Victoria, and served on the GDC National council until 1999. In 1998, he compiled the ‘Sample Contract and Standard Terms and Conditions’ for the GDC, a document which became the Pro Forma Agreement for designers across Canada. Since 2003 he has served on the GDC’s national Ethics Committee.
Following the 1991 Icograda World Design Congress in Montreal (at which he conducted creative workshops), Peters was designated as the GDC’s official delegate and liaison, representing Canada to the International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda), at Icograda General Assemblies in Glasgow, Oporto (Portugal), Punta del Este (Uruguay), and Sydney between 1992 and 1999.
Peters was on the Icograda board from 1999 to 2005, serving as President from 2001 to 2003. Significant achievements during Peters’ six years on the Icograda board include: development of the NGO’s first web presence by means of a content-rich portal (Icograda Website), rejuvenation of the network ‘Friends of Icograda’, conception and launch of both the Icograda Design Education Network (inaugurated on Icograda’s 40th anniversary and World Graphics Day, 27 April 2003, in Brno, Czech Republic), and the Icograda Design Media Network (launched in Istanbul, Turkey on 31 January 2004), consolidation of the Icograda Archive in conjunction with the Design History Research Centre Archives at the University of Brighton. Co-organization of Icograda congresses in Seoul (‘Oullim’ 2000), Johannesburg, South Africa (‘Continental Shift’ 2001), and Nagoya, Japan (‘VISUALOGUE’ 2003—with some 3700 delegates from 49 countries in attendance, the world’s largest ever congress of graphic designers). Peters also served as official liaison between Icograda and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) as well as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) from 2001 to 2005.
Peters joined the board of the international humanitarian organization Design for the World (DW) in 2000 and was appointed as a Vice President in 2002; in 2004 he was named an Honorary Member of the Brno Biennale Association; he was a member of the founding executive of the International Design Alliance (IDA) from 2003 to 2005. He serves as a member of the Advisory Board of the Design Innovation Institute (Dii), acts as a special ambassador on behalf of the Taiwan Design Center and is a member of the editorial advisory group of Geez magazine.
In 2009, Peters received the Icograda President's Award during the opening ceremonies of Xin: Icograda World Design Congress 2009 at the National Centre for the Performing Arts (China) in Beijing, China. Peters also began serving on the Applied Arts Magazine Advisory Board regarding design issues.
In 2010, Peters was appointed as an ambassador for INDIGO (the International Indigenous Design Network).
Teaching.
From 1984 to 1986, Peters taught Creative Communications at Red River College, Winnipeg. Between 1988 and 1990 he was a sessional Graphic Design instructor at the School of Art, University of Manitoba; from 1990 to 1993 he was an Assistant Professor and Chair of Graphic Design, at the School of Art. Since the early 1990s he has been a frequent guest lecturer on graphic design and visual communication at schools in North America, Asia, and Europe.
Between 2004 and 2006, Peters was a regular guest lecturer at the ICIS Centre (International Centre for Creativity, Innovation and Sustainability) in Hornbaek, Denmark. 
In 2006, Peters was the recipient of the (University of Hartford’s) Hartford Art School’s Georgette and Richard Koopman Distinguished Chair in Visual Arts. As a part of this assignment he taught a studio course in the Visual Communication Design Department entitled “Cause an Effect” consisting of topical modules relating to globalism and cross-cultural issues. One of the student projects arising from this engagement was the “Migrant Immigrant eXchange 2006” (MIX06) cultural exchange project undertaken along with students of Russell Kennedy at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia with the aim of encouraging contemporary discourse between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous designers/ collaborators in Australia and the USA, in recognition and respect of both First Nation and Aboriginal culture.
Later in 2006, Peters spent four weeks in Melbourne as Designer in Residence at Monash University, with a focus being the preparation and launch of the traveling exhibition “MIX06: One Step Back, Two Steps Forward.” 
In 2007 and 2008, Peters served as External Moderator to graduating students at the Wanganui School of Design in Wanganui, New Zealand.
Selected Articles & Publications.
From 1994 to 1997 Peters served as a member of The Design Sector Steering Committee, Human Resources Development Canada, and contributed to the strategic 1996 document prepared for the committee by Price Waterhouse: 'Shaping Canada’s Future by Design'

Hernâni Madruga Neves (born 2 November 1963 in Mourão, Évora), known as simply Hernâni, is a Portuguese retired association football and beach soccer player. In the former, he played as a defensive midfielder.
Football career.
In a career greatly hampered by injuries, Hernâni only played one solid season as a professional, 1987–88, appearing in 23 out of 38 matches to help the Sado club finish in eighth position and attracting attention of top division powerhouse S.L. Benfica, which signed him in the subsequent off-season.
On 4 December 1988 Hernâni scored a rare goal, netting for Benfica in a 2–0 home win against former side Setúbal. A fortnight later, after a 2–0 home success against Lisbon neighbours Sporting Clube de Portugal on 18 December 1988,receiving a three-month ban (originally six). His career effectively ended there as, after being reinstated, he could hardly get a game due to constant injuries; one of the few bright spots was a start in the 1989–90 European Cup final against A.C. Milan, where he played a good overall game marking Frank Rijkaard – eventually the scorer of the game's only goal.
A return to Setúbal proved fruitless (14 games in two campaigns combined), and Hernâni retired from the game in June 1997 at age 33 after a spell in the second level with modest C.D. Beja, where he reunited with former Vitória teammate Adelino Nunes. He also gained two caps for the Portuguese national team, his debut coming on 5 December 1987 in a 0–3 loss in Italy for the UEFA Euro 1988 qualifiers.
Beach soccer.
One year after retiring, Hernâni started appearing for the Portugal national beach soccer team, being one of its leading figures for one full decade and winning a total of 14 titles, as well as many other top-three finishes.
From 2006 to 2009 he also played at club level, with Italian side Cavalieri del Mare.

Koravar

The Koravar were one of the tribes of the Madras Presidency during the British Raj in India. They were primarily involved in the salt trade. In 1913 they were classed as a criminal tribe by the British authorities. Today there are an estimated 1.2 million (12 lakh) Koravar in Tamil Nadu.
Ethnonym.
People of this community are called with different names in different parts of South India. They are called as Yerukula in Andhra Pradesh, Korama or Koracha in Karnataka, Kaikadi in Maharashtra, Kattu Naicker in Puducherry, and Sidanar in Kerala. In essence, all these communities form a great big community from south India. The gothras among all these communities is the same, i.e. Kavadi, Sathupadi, Maanupadi and Mendraguthi. They are also known as Malai Kuruvans, Kuravans, Thalaiyaris, Kavalkara koravars, uppu koravars, Dabi Koravars(simbu koravars), Gandarvakottai Koravars, Inji Koravars, Koravars, Kalinji Dabikoravars, Kala Koravars, Monda Koravars, karuvapillai koravars, Thogamalai koravars, mel nadu and kel nadu koravars, Kathukuthi koravars, Pachai kuthi Koravars, sidanars,Kattu Naickers, Panikers, vedars, vettuvars,

Secular Homeschooling (magazine)

Secular Homeschooling is an American magazine for people who homeschool for reasons other than religion. It began as a quarterly, but became a bimonthly in July 2009.
Because the magazine is written (and, presumably read) by people who consider religious belief a personal matter rather than a prerequisite of homeschooling, it might be seen as reflecting the diversity of the homeschooling community.
As a specifically non-religious magazine, Secular Homeschooling discusses some topics differently from other homeschooling magazines. For example, one article discussed the particular difficulties of discussing and dealing with death for the non religious. In the article "The Most Difficult Subject", the author writes that death is, to religious families "less threatening as a concept, it’s also much more frequent and natural a subject of conversation and thought" because some of their religious beliefs focus on death (Jesus' death and resurrection, for example).
The magazine occasionally runs humor as well. One piece, "The Bitter Homeschooler's Wish List" – "a wish list from one homeschooler to other parents who ask annoying and inappropriate questions about the decision to homeschool" – has been described as a "legendary Internet screed". The list bitterly points out that not all homeschoolers are religious or homeschool for religious reasons, and that homeschoolers of all types tire of being criticized.

The title Lord Bellenden, of Broughton, was a lordship of Parliament created in the Peerage of Scotland on 10 June 1661 for William Bellenden, who was Treasurer-depute of Scotland. Shortly before his death, he resigned his peerage in favour of his first cousin twice removed, John Ker (later Bellenden). In 1804, the seventh lord inherited the dukedom of Roxburghe from his cousin. On his death in 1805, the dukedom later passed to another cousin and the lordship of Parliament became extinct.

Thomas Nuthall

Thomas Nuthall (d. 7 March 1775) was an English politician and attorney who played an historic role in the ministries of William Pitt, Lord Bute, and Lord Rockingham. He was probably from Norfolk, and his first appointments came from Robert Walpole, who placed him in the Excise Office in 1740. By 1749, Nuthall was the receiver of hackney coaches.
Horace Walpole used Nuthall to get Margaret Nicoll freed to marry George Walpole in 1751, but he thought Nuthall corrupt and mistrusted him. In 1757, Nuthall married Susan, a widow. By the time of his death, he had remarried, so the mother of Nuthall's legitimate son, Robert, could be either woman. (Nuthall had two bastard children as well.)
William Pitt became Nuthall's protector and sponsor in the 1750s, and his connection to the family would remain steadfast. Generally, Nuthall was employed as an intermediary or "ambassador" between various political factions and Pitt. His first service in this regard was between Pitt and Thomas Pelham on bringing down Lord Bute's government. In return for his service, Pitt obtained several offices for Nuthall, with the most telling in the long run being solicitor for the Treasury in 1765.
In 1766, he formed a legal partnership with John Skirrow, and Skirrow would later be Nuthall's executor. The same year, he went through long negotiations between Pitt and Rockingham to form a new government. This so-called "Nuthall interval" (Kilburn 289) dragged out a period of Parliamentary paralysis, as no bills could move forward. Soon after this, the first investigation into his shortcomings as an attorney began, and it appeared that he had been quite sloppy in his affairs, leaving much without proper authority.
His death was sudden. On 7 March 1775 his coach was attacked by a highwayman on Hounslow Heath. Nuthall returned fire on the robber, who then fled. When the coach came to Hounslow, Nuthall wrote a description of his attacker to be given to Sir John Fielding and then immediately died. After his death, auditing his accounts showed that Nuthall had been guilty of substantial malfeasance.

Dimension of Miracles

Dimension of Miracles is a 1968 satirical science-fiction novel by Robert Sheckley.
The novel concerns the odyssey of Tom Carmody, a New Yorker who wins a prize in the Intergalactic Sweepstakes.
Plot summary.
Thanks to a computer error, Tom Carmody, an unlucky civil servant, wins the main prize of the Galactic Lottery. Being a human from the Earth, he doesn't even reach the level of the 32nd class creature, therefore he doesn't possess galactic status and shouldn't even be eligible. However, he obtains the Prize before the mistake is found out and is allowed to keep it. That's when his adventure begins, since, not being a space-traveling creature, he has no homing instinct that can guide him back to Earth, and so the galactic lottery organizers cannot transport him home. At the same time, his removal from his home environment has caused, by the 'universal law of predation', a predatory entity to spring into existence that perpetually pursues and aims to destroy him. So Carmody is forced to be on the run, and with the help of his Prize meets several well-meaning (but usually not very competent) aliens that attempt to find where, when and which Earth he belongs on. He ends up transporting from Earth to Earth: different phases and realities of his planet, which of course, is not in the time or condition he expects it to be.
Similarity with "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".
"Dimension of Miracles" has been cited as similar to Douglas Adams's "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". In an interview for Neil Gaiman's book "", Gaiman said Adams had not read the Sheckley work until after writing the Guide, but found the two works to be "disturbing close."

<doc id="18571098" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18571098" title="General Board of the United States Navy">
General Board of the United States Navy

The General Board of the United States Navy was an advisory body of the United States Navy, effectively a naval general staff. The General Board was established by general order 544, issued on March 13, 1900 by John Davis Long. The order was officially recognized by Congress in 1916. The General Board was disbanded in 1951.
Origins.
"The war with Spain had underlined the need for adequate staff work and the success of the War Board had pointed the way for the future. Among the most persistent advocates of a general staff for the Navy was Captain H. C. Taylor. He had first laid plans for such a staff before Roosevelt in May 1897; now in 1900 he brought the idea once more to the attention of Secretary Long. Long, however, was reluctant to risk a fight with his entrenched bureau chiefs, hesitant about allowing the professional officers wide powers outside civilian control, and rightly dubious whether Congress could be brought to approve the scheme. Consequently he compromised, and in March 1900 created a Board, known as the General Board, which possessed no executive functions, but was to serve as a purely advisory council which was constitutionally confined to considering such problems of strategy as the Secretary of the Navy might refer to it."
Purpose and composition.
The General Board was composed of senior admirals, most near the end of their careers, who could be relied upon to "deliberate selflessly and objectively on matters ranging from strategy to ship characteristics". "These senior officers, some in the twilight of their careers, without line responsibilities, and others members on an "ex officio" basis, not only brought considerable expertise to bear, they also had the time to devote to problem solving without the press of day-to-day decision making." 
"The board had two categories of members - the full time executive committee and "ex officio" members, senior officers holding specifics posts, who attended monthly board meetings... the "ex officio" members of the board included the President of the Naval War College, the director of naval intelligence, and the chief of the Bureau of Navigation. The general board was a watered-down version of the naval general staff proposed by a line officer, Captain Henry C. Taylor, in February 1900."
"Originally consisting of nine officers, the membership of the board was changed frequently - in 1902 to 10; in 1904 to 14; in 1905 to seven; and in 1909 back to nine."
The board was headed by a chairman (also known as its president). George Dewey chaired the board from its inception until 1917, although a stroke in 1914 limited his abilities in the last three years of his tenure.
"The role that the General Board of the Navy played was the critical organizational dynamic in linking the treaty system and innovation in the fleet. Particularly astonishing, given the hierarchical nature of the U.S. Navy, was the General Board’s tolerant and consensus-driven process which led to an environment highly favorable to creativity and innovation."
Dissolution.
In its beginning years, the General Board of the United States Navy was effectively a naval general staff, but started to lose its influence with the creation of the Chief of Naval Operations. "The creation of the office of Chief of Naval Operations in 1915 reduced some of the importance of the board, but even until the beginning of World War II some of the most senior admirals on the active list and some very experienced retired admirals were assigned to the General Board... During the latter years of its life - particularly since War II, the establishment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Unification Act - the General Board was put to less and less use." The board was inactivated by order of Chief of Naval Operations Forrest Sherman in April 1951 and abolished the following month.

Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar

In cryptography, the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) scheme is a modified version of the Oil and Vinegar scheme designed by J. Patarin. Both are digital signature schemes. They belong to the group of multivariate cryptography. The security of this signature scheme is based on an NP-hard mathematical problem. To create and validate signatures a minimal quadratic equations system has to be solved. Solving equations with variables is an NP-hard problem, even when using a real existing quantum computer. Therefore, the signature schemes based on multivariate equations systems are considered to be quantum resistant.
Public and private key.
Every asymmetric scheme has a public and a private key (public-key cryptography). In known schemes like RSA the keys are bit strings. In the UOV scheme, and in every other multivariate signature scheme the keys are more complex.
The mathematical problem is to solve formula_1 equations with formula_2 variables. The whole equations system is the public key.
To use a mathematical problem for cryptography it has to be modified. The computing of the formula_2 variables would need a lot of resources. A standard computer isn't able to compute this in an acceptable time. Therefore, a special Trapdoor gets inserted into the equations system. This trapdoor is the private key. It consists of three parts: Two affine transformations formula_4 and formula_5 and a polynomial vector formula_6. Both transformations are used to transform elements in certain groups. formula_4 transforms formula_8 to formula_9. The second transformation formula_5 transforms the variable vector to the valid signature.
The third secret element formula_6 provides certain tools for the equations creation. The equations are built with certain rules which are only known to the owner of the private key.
Creation of a signature.
To create a valid signature the following equations system has to be solved
Here the formula_13 is a given message which should be signed. The valid signature is formula_14.
To sign a given formula_8, the message must first be transformed to fit in the equations system. formula_4 is used to "split" the message to acceptable pieces formula_17. Then the equations have to be built. Every single equation has the same form:
The next steps sign a given message formula_8 and the result is a valid signature formula_20.
The vinegar and oil variables build the pre-signature formula_24. Finally formula_25 gets transformed by the private transformation formula_5 to give the valid signature formula_27.
The system of equations becomes linear if the vinegar variables are fixed – no oil variable is multiplied with another oil variable in the equation. Therefore, the oil variables can be computed easily using, for example, a Gaussian reduction algorithm. The signature creation is itself fast and computationally easy.
Validation of a signature.
The signature is transmitted to the communication partner. The validation of the signature is performed with the help of the public key, which is an equations system.
This system of equations is a slightly modified version of the system needed for signature creation. It is modified so that an attacker cannot get information about the secret coefficients and the special formatting of the oil and vinegar variables. Every equation of the public key has to be solved to validate the signature. The input is the signature itself. If every result formula_29 is equal to the corresponding part of the original message, then the verification succeeded.
Problems and advantages of the UOV scheme.
A primary advantage is that the mathematical problem to be solved in the algorithm is quantum-resistant. That is, if someday a quantum computer is built that can handle enough states to break commercial signature schemes like RSA or ElGamal, the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar signature scheme remains secure, as no algorithm currently exists that gives a quantum computer a great advantage in solving these multivariate systems of equations.
The second advantage is that the operations used in the equations are relatively simple. Signatures get created and validated only with addition and multiplication of "small" values, making this signature viable for low-resource hardware like in smart cards.
A disadvantage is that UOV uses very long key-lengths, with the public key being the entire system of formula_1 equations, which can require several kilobytes of storage. UOV is also a young digital signature scheme. While some attack methods are already known, many more will certainly appear if UOV becomes widely used. It is not yet ready for commercial use.

Edward Park Duplex (May 13, 1831 – January 5, 1900) was an African-American pioneer of California. He was elected mayor of Wheatland, California in 1888.
Biography.
Edward Park Duplex, born in New Haven, Connecticut, was the oldest son of Prince Jr. and Adaline Duplex. His father died in 1832 leaving Adaline, a dressmaker, to support the three Duplex children. Edward and his brother learned the barbering trade in New Haven before setting out in 1854 to join the California gold rush. Their mother joined them in 1860. The family developed a successful business enterprise of hair care service and products. Edward's establishment in Wheatland, Yuba County, California became a center of political and social discourse, and he personally played a prominent politician in northern California, serving as mayor of Wheatland, a small community near Sacramento. He married Sophie Elizabeth and had several children. His life and accomplishments are described in several articles and books on African American pioneers of California.

When Johnny Comes Marching Home (film)

When Johnny Comes Marching Home is a 1942 musical film starring Allan Jones and Jane Frazee. The film was directed by Charles Lamont and is loosely based on the song with the same title.
Plot.
Johnny Kovacs (Jones) is a war hero who comes back home for a ten-day leave. Pursued by a woman (Shelton) who considers herself his fiance, he works with his superior officers to hide during his leave. He adopts the name Johnny O'Rourke, and finds a room at a theatrical boarding house. He becomes friends with some other boarders (including O'Connor, Ryan and Gloria Jean) and falls in love with a woman (Frazee). His friends overhear him talking to his officer on the phone. They misinterpret the conversation and conclude that he is a deserter. They push him into giving himself up and returning to duty. Confused by their behavior at first, he figures out what they are up to, and plays along. It all works out in the end. The closing song in the picture is a rousing patriotic number sung directly to the audience by the main players in the film.
Reception.
The New York Times called Universal Pictures "miraculous" for "bringing this star-studded entertainment in under budget and within a 73-minute running time".

<doc id="18571209" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18571209" title="Christopher Bechtler">
Christopher Bechtler

Christopher (alias Christian) Bechtler (1782–1843) was a German-born American goldsmith and watchmaker. He became rich and famous through an American gold rush based on his concept of producing defined gold dollars, the Bechtler Dollars, in the early 1830s and by 1840, before the US government itself started to produce gold dollars in 1849.
Life.
Bechtler was born in Pforzheim, Margraviate of Baden. In 1767 Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, allowed watch manufacturing in Pforzheim and started a technical school. The latter gave ground to further educational institutions and is now the Goldschmiedeschule mit Uhrmacherschule Pforzheim (Jewelers and Watchmakers School of Pforzheim); Bechtler was trained there. Around 1820, Bechtler spotted small gold traces in Stubensand, an early household abrasive. In 1823 he requested a mining concession and tried placer mining for gold in the late triassic Stubensandstein around neighboring Sternenfels where the Stubensand was produced. The amount of gold found was not satisfactory, but Bechtler asked for a Ducal Badensian Patent for his gold washing machine in 1819.
In 1829 Bechtler and his family, his wife, two sons and a nephew, emigrated to the United States. In 1830 he opened a watchmaker store in Philadelphia, the site of the first US Mint, but he quickly went further to North Carolina during one of the early gold rushes.
The Bechtler Private Mint.
Bechtler and his predecessors' private mint in Rutherford County, North Carolina, was run from 1831 till the 1850s and produced more than a million gold coins from 1831 till 1841. Bechtler's precision and the reliable gold content of his coins allowed him to prevail against other producers and to obtain a large fortune. He died in Rutherfordton, North Carolina. Bechtler coins today are collectables of high esteem.
Coinage.
The Bechtler's mint produced coins in three denominations: $1, $2.50, and $5, and the coins were struck in three Fineness: 20 carats, 21 carats, and 22 carats. At the time and within the limits of the existing technology, the coins were considered of honest weight.
Bechtler's Coins Today.
Because of the Coinage Act of June 28, 1834, which increased the value of gold by more than 6%, Bechtler's coins today are quite scarce and consequently, command high prices when offered for sale. The North Carolina National Bank of Charlotte has a collection that can be viewed today.

Battle of Venta de Echavarri

The Battle of Venta de Echavarri ( or , literally the "Battle of the Inn of Echavarri"), a battle of the First Carlist War, occurred on October 28, 1834. It was an immediate follow-up to the Battle of Alegría de Álava, which had occurred the day before. It was a Carlist victory. 
Background.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Alegría de Álava on October 27, the Carlists searched the forests between Chinchetru and Alegría de Álava for Liberal troops who had survived the battle and were now hiding. Liberals who were discovered were executed on the spot. 
The Carlists captured the two pieces of artillery that had belonged to the Liberal army, along with corresponding munitions and the regimental banner of the Liberal Regiment of Africa. Manuel O'Doyle and other Liberal officers surrendered, and were executed by firing squad the next day.
However, 250 Liberal troops and their officers maintained order and reached Arrieta by forced march, 3 km away from the field of battle, and they fortified themselves in the church at Arrieta. There they fought against the Carlists who pursued them all during the night. 
News of this action at Arrieta led Osma to the decision to send soldiers to the rescue of the troops at Arrieta the next morning, which would lead to the Battle of Venta de Echavarri.
The terrain.
Zumalacárregui took advantage of his knowledge of the terrain to trick his enemy, luring the Liberals to places more suited to the guerrilla tactics of the Carlists than the maneuvers of the Isabeline regulars. The terrain of the battle was laid out as such: leaving Vitoria for the old royal road towards the East, one crosses a plain for 12 kilometers, flanked on the right or South by the foothills of the range of Andia and on the left or North by the range of San Adrián. The Zadorra River, coming from the East, runs close to the range of San Adrián. The plain slopes gently from the south to the north, and rises, almost imperceptibly, towards the east. 
At the end of this distance of 12 kilometers rises the height of Quilchano, to which reach from the East the hills of Dallo, thus cutting the plan in two. The left of the plain slopes towards the Zadorra while the right sinks into a 60 meter deep depression. The northern slopes of the hills of Dallo slope gently towards the Dallo while its southern slopes, rocky and devoid of any vegetation, fall precipitously towards the depression. This southern slope is where the royal road runs. 
At the bottom of the slope there is a breech towards the north in the hills of Dallo, there is a creek into which the Zadorra drains. There is a bridge over this creek, and on the other side (in the direction of Vitoria) can be found the place known as "la venta de Echavarri" –in other words, the Inn of Echavarri, where waggoners and travelers, either on their way up or down the hills, would stop for repairs, food, and gossip. Near the inn, about a kilometer and a half away, can be found the place known as Echavarri-Urtupiña, and more towards the east 2 and half kilometers away, is the place known as Arrieta.
Troops.
Osma's troops included O'Doyle's former division, which included:
The Liberal troops also included:
The Carlists counted on:
The battle.
Osma's troops reached the heights of Quilchano and spotted the Carlists in oblique formation in the depression near Arrieta. It was two o’clock in the afternoon. Zumalacarregui knew that Osma wished to release the Liberal troops trapped in Arrieta, and therefore masked the place, formed his men, and addressed his men –to which they responded with "A ellos! A ellos!" ("At'em! At'em!")
Osma moved his troops. Two battalions of carabineers with their squadron of cavalry and a company of the Battalion of Bujalance descended into the valley. Once they crossed the bridge, the First Battalion of Carabineers under Martín Iriarte, and a company of mountain troops from the Battalion of Bujalance ascended to the nearest hills of Dallo, creating the Isabeline left flank. The Second Battalion of Carabineers and a squadron of cavalry remained at the bottom of the valley, forming the Isabeline right flank. 
On the peak that rose above the inn, on the west to the opening that empties into the Zadorra were stationed half of the Queen’s Second Battalion and at the entrance to this opening were stationed a 50 members of the cavalry company of the Bujalance. On the slope, as a reserve there remained the other half of the Queen’s Second Battalion with 50 cavalrymen, the Battalion of Salamanca, and the rest of the Bujalance Battalion. The Battalion of San Fernando remained near the height of the depression, to the right. Two eight-pounders were placed on the slope near the bridge. 
The Isabeline formation was defensively arranged, without a center, contrary to its goal of advancing towards Arrieta. Osma believed that Zumalacárregui, victorious after the Battle of Alegría de Alava, would attack the Liberals, advancing through the depression. The Liberal plan was to allow the Carlists to attack and then bombard them with artillery, and the Liberals in the valley would then pursue the Carlists until Arrieta.
Zumalacárregui, understanding the intentions of the Liberal troops, and knowledgeable of the terrain, advanced his troops across the valley but before they were in reach of the Liberal artillery, he sent the majority of his troops rapidly towards the north and up the hills of Dallo. Once at the top, the Carlists were able to advance rapidly since the slopes of the Dallo on the north sloped gently, and approached the Isabeline troops on the hilltop. Osma had stationed few troops there, and seems to have been lacking in knowledge of the terrain, believing that the north face of the hills had the same formation as those of the south, and that the Isabeline troops would be able to defend themselves easily there against a numerically superior foe, as if behind an actual wall. But the Isabelines on the hilltops were not able to withstand the attack of the Carlist First and Third Battalions of Navarre, and abandoned their positions, descending towards the bridge. The Carlists, occupying the crests, continued to advance by the northern slopes, and reached the opening and advanced towards the bridge. Osma, on the hilltop, did not have a clear view of what was happening on his left flank, but on seeing his troops descend from the hilltops, sent as reinforcements to the bridge his reserve the rest of the Bujalance Battalion and half of the Queen's Battalion. But the Carlists troops were also arriving by the royal road to the same spot. With a battalion of Guías de Navarra at the Carlist vanguard, the Carlists crossed the bridge and assaulted the hilltop above the Inn of Echavarri, defended by half of the Queen’s Second Battalion.
Once the Isabeline troops of the right flank formed at the depression had joined combat, the left flank was surrounded by the Carlists and had begun to scatter. "Disregarding the enemy’s fire, the Carlists advanced, and the guides de Navarra having passed a bridge at the distance of half a musket-shot, the Liberals' left was turned."
The right flank also began to break formation and scatter, escaping out of the depression, and suffering casualties inflicted by the Carlists. It seemed that a massacre like the one that had occurred at Alegría de Álava would occur, but Zumalacárregui ordered his troops to give quarter to those who surrendered. The battle had lasted barely an hour. The Carlists cleared the hill, and when the battle was over, a pursuit began, and along the royal road, the Liberals fled in complete disorder and were pursued to the very gates of Vitoria-Gasteiz. The Carlists captured 3,000 muskets as spoils of war.
Aftermath.
Osma, in his account of the battle to Isabel II, placed all of the blame on his troops, stating that "...all of the spots were abandoned the troops without resistance, not heeding my own example to hold these spots nor stop from fleeing in a most humiliating fashion, and confirming what I have said to Your Majesty that everything is now lost, for all honor is lost...” Iriarte, however, who was one of Osma's officers, and who had participated in the battle, would criticize Osma for his actions during the battle, and it was concluded that Osma should have occupied the town of Echavarri-Urtupiña, converting it into a miniature stronghold with the two Liberal cannons. This would have allowed the Liberal troops at Arrieta to escape safely. 
The Liberal troops trapped at Arrieta meanwhile had seen the whole battle from the churchtower. Fog descended upon the town and at midnight, with bayonets fixed, killed the few Carlists who had attempted to stop their escape. They reached Maetzu, where there was an Isabeline force. On November 1, 1834, they reached Vitoria without incident. 
The Liberal Army was in disarray, and the Liberal troops at Pamplona barely had firewood with which to cook their meals. The two Liberal divisions of Navarre retired to the Puentelarreina–Pamplona Line, giving Zumalacárregui a golden opportunity to launch an attack on the rich zones of Navarre. The Carlist general would advance through Los Arcos, Sesma, Miranda de Arga, Peralta, Villafranca, crossing the Arga and Aragón Rivers and near the monastery of La Oliva and Sanguesa returned to the Pyrenees, crossing the Arga again north of Pamplona, finally stationing himself at La Berrueza. He would return with a number of supplies, clothes, money, and new troops. The morale of the Carlists was very high, and they decided to fight the Liberal troops in a formal battle (rather than with guerrilla tactics). This would happen on December 14, 1834, at the Battle of Mendaza –which would be a Carlist defeat.

<doc id="18571243" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18571243" title="Basophil activation">
Basophil activation

Allergic symptoms are caused by an initial systemic histamine release by activated basophiles and mast cells, that may lead to shock with laryngeal edema, lower-airway obstruction and hypotension. This is why basophiles are considered with mast cells to be the key cells in allergic diseases.
Activation process.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a class of antibody (or immunoglobulin "isotype") that has only been found in mammals. It plays an important role in allergy, and is especially associated with type 1 hypersensitivity. There are receptors (FcεR) for the constant region of IgE, the Fc region, on several types of cells, including Mast cells and Basophils. Basophils contain many granules inside the cell, which are filled with a variety of active substance triggering an allergic response upon degranulation.
The cells get activated and start degranulation when the IgE antibody, bound to an allergen which can bind to the specific variable region of the IgE, the Fab region, bind to the Fc receptor
"In vitro" allergy test method.
In most cases, a positive skin test is used in identification of allergies, but the activation of basophilic granulocytes with anti-IgE, the expression of the CD63 antigen on the cell surface (plasma membrane) allows identification of the allergen responsible for the hypersensitivity reaction without performing the common scratch test. Only a little amount of blood is needed for this experiment, which makes it comfortable to use since one can perform it in parallel to a normal blood checkup. It can be used for different allergies (e.g. bee venom, drugs, contrast media).
Degranulation.
Degranulated cell expose CD63 molecules on their outer cell membrane, hence the granules, which contain CD63 molecules on their inner surface, merged with the cell membrane. The inner cell surface of the granules becomes the outer cell surface of the basophile /mast cell during degranulation process.
Labeling and sorting.
As flow cytometry is a valuable tool for analyzing large numbers of cells and for identifying cell populations, even at low concentrations, the percentage of basophiles activated after in vitro stimulation by allergens and expressing the CD63 marker can be determined. The CD63 marker is an FITC labeled antigen which can bind to an CD63 protein and is used to sort the cells via FACS(Fluorescence activated cell sorting/sorter). This FITC labeled antigen emits light at a wavelength of 530 nm. As the emitted fluorescence intensity is proportional to the binding sites of each single cell, the intensity will increase according to the number of FITC- conjugated antibodies bound to CD63 expressing cells.
Procedure.
A test tube is prepared with basophile stimulation buffer (BSB) including Interleukin 3 and an allergen which is to be tested. The blood sample is added and the tube is incubated at 37°C for several minutes, to ensure that the allergens can bind to the IgE. By adding EDTA to the test tube, the degranulation process is stopped immediately. After degranulation a CD63 marker (labeld antibodies) is added to the test tube. Several minutes at room temperature gives the marker time to bind to the CD63 proteins on the cell membrane of the basophil. A lysing step is performed to lyse the red blood cells. Because they outnumber by far the leucocytes they need to be removed to do a FACS analysis of the Basophils.

Herbert Jobst

Herbert Jobst (July 30, 1915 – June 28, 1990) was a German writer.
Life.
Herbert Jobst was the son of a miner from Neu-Welzow, Lusatia who died in World War I. As a small child, he would be abandoned by his mother in Radeberg and spend his youth in homes and with different foster parents. After his attendance of the Volksschule, he completed training as a printer in Meissen. In the following years, he became a member of the Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend (Socialist Worker Youth) the "Roten Falken" (Red Falcons) and "Naturfreunde" (Nature Friends). He would be drafted to the labour service for the "Nazi Re-education". In 1934, Jobst went to Austria, Italy and Yugoslavia, where he led the life of a vagabond and he survived by begging, provisional money of the printers guild and casual work for water. The Austrian authorities deported him into the German Reich in 1937 where he would be drafted into the Wehrmacht however because of the "Wehrkraftzersetzung" (subversion of military strength) he was quickly sent to the Military Prison Torgau. With the breakout of World War II, he received casual work at the so-called "Frontbewährung" (Front Probation). Jobst participated as a soldier of the Wehrmacht at the Eastern Front and would be imprisoned in Heiligenbeil, East Prussia as a Soviet prisoner of war. Until 1947, he worked in Tscheljabinsk, Siberia in the Camp 8 coal mine. He returned to Germany in 1947, starting as a night watchman in Dresden. From 1948 to 1956 he worked for Wismut-AG beginning as a miner and extraction man. Since he completed a study at the Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg in 1952/53, he was promoted to climber. After his first writing attempt, he would become a member of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Junger Autoren. In 1957 he moved to Flöha, Saxony making a living as a writer and then lived Neustrelitz from 1967 until his death in 1990. He would marry lyrical poet Lisa Jobst.
Herbert Jobst was a writer of novels, narratives and screenplays. His best known work was the much read in East Germany, being the powerful autobiographical colored Novel Tetralogy "Der dramatische Lebensweg des Adam Probst" (The Dramatic Way of Life of Adam Probst). In them, the author tells the life story of a social outcast who endures Simplicius Simplicissimus thing, above all in the group "Der Vagabund", in a popular, humor filled to satirical tone.
Herbert Jobst received the 1958 Heinrich Mann Prize and the 1965 Kunstpreis des Bezirkes Karl-Marx-Stadt in addition to the Free German Trade Union Federation Prize and Fritz Reuter Prize the same year.

John McGraw

John Joseph McGraw (April 7, 1873 – February 25, 1934), nicknamed "Little Napoleon" and "Muggsy," was a Major League Baseball player and long-time manager of the New York Giants. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.
Much-lauded as a player, McGraw was one of the standard-bearers of dead-ball era major league baseball. Known for having fists as quick as his temper, McGraw used every advantage he could get as both a player and manager. He took full advantage of baseball's initial structure that only provided for one umpire, becoming notorious for tripping, blocking and impeding a baserunner in any way he could while the umpire was distracted by the flight of the ball. His profligacy in employing such tactics may have led to additional umpires being assigned to monitor the basepaths.
However, even with his success and notoriety as a player, he is most well known for his record as a manager. His total of 2,763 victories in that capacity ranks second overall behind only Connie Mack; he still holds the National League record with 2,669 wins in the senior circuit. McGraw is widely held to be "the best player to become a great manager" in the history of baseball.
Personal life.
Early years.
McGraw's father, a widower whose name was also John, moved to Truxton, New York in 1871. He and his older brother Michael had immigrated from Ireland more than 15 years earlier. As a widower and an Irish immigrant, life was exceptionally difficult. He and his brother had arrived in time for the Civil War, and were drawn into the conflict as part of the Union army. Shortly after the war, he married and McGraw's older half-sister was born. John McGraw senior's first wife died, and he began moving around looking for work—a search that ultimately led him to Truxton, New York. It was there that the elder John McGraw married young Ellen Comerfort, and where the younger John McGraw was born on April 7, 1873.
The younger John McGraw was named "John" after his father, and "Joseph" after his grandfather back in Ireland. Even as a baby, young Johnny (as he was called) had raven hair, and eyes so dark that many people thought they were black. The boy's birth was the first of many to the family, as seven more children were born over the course of the next 12 years. The sheer number of children, combined with the paucity of well-compensated work led to hard times for the large family. It was often a struggle simply to have ample food for everyone and clothing enough to protect them all from the harsh winters of upstate New York.
Tragedy struck the family in the winter of 1884, when a debilitating fever swept through the family. Johnny's mother was the first to succumb, and his half-sister Anna, 13, died shortly thereafter. By the time the month of January in 1885 had passed, three more McGraw children had died. The devastated family moved from their house in the country into a hotel in town. Johnny's father, understandably bitter, heaped even more responsibility on the young boy's shoulders, and had very little patience for his son's passion for baseball. He became abusive toward the boy, and later on in 1885 (still only 12 years old), Johnny ran away. From that day onward, he was raised by a kindly neighbor, Mary Goddard, under whose care he did quite well.
During his years as part of Mrs. Goddard's household, he took on several jobs that allowed him to save money to buy baseballs and the Spalding magazines that chronicled the rules changes in the rival major leagues of baseball, the National League, and the American Association. He quickly became the best player on his school team. Shortly after his 16th birthday, he began playing for his town's team, the Truxton Grays, making a favorable impression on their manager, Albert "Bert" Kenney. While he could play any position, his ability to throw a big curveball made him the star pitcher. It was McGraw's relationship with Bert Kenney that would precipitate his professional playing career.
Marriages.
McGraw, then 23, married Minnie Doyle, the daughter of prominent Baltimore politician Michael Doyle, on February 3, 1897. This was at the height of his fame as a player for the old Baltimore Orioles of the National League. Two years later, while McGraw was on a road trip with his team, she developed appendicitis. An emergency appendectomy was performed, and McGraw was called back from Louisville, Kentucky. However, her condition worsened and, surrounded by not only McGraw, but other members of the family as well, young Minnie, only 23 years old, died on September 1, 1899.
He married his second wife, Blanche Sindall, on January 8, 1902. She outlived McGraw by nearly 30 years, dying on November 4, 1962. Even after her husband's death, Mrs. McGraw was a devoted fan of the team he had managed for so long. In 1951, she threw out the first pitch during a World Series game in which her beloved Giants played the New York Yankees. Sadly for Mrs. McGraw, the Yankees won that day, 6–2, and would go on to win the championship—their third in a row—in six games.
Later years.
In 1923, only nine years before he would retire, McGraw reflected on his life inside the game he loved in his memoir "My Thirty Years in Baseball." He stepped down as manager of the New York Giants in the middle of the 1932 season. He was reactivated briefly when he accepted the invitation to manage the National League team in the 1933 All-Star Game.
Less than two years after retiring, McGraw died of uremic poisoning at age 60 and is interred in New Cathedral (Roman Catholic) Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.
Connie Mack would surpass McGraw's major league victory total just months later.
After his death McGraw's wife found, among his personal belongings, a list of all of the African-American players he wanted to sign over the years, but was unable.
Baseball career.
In the minor leagues.
In 1890, Bert Kenney bought a portion of the new professional baseball franchise in Olean, New York. The team was to play in the newly formed New York-Pennsylvania League. In return for this investment, he was named player/manager of the team (this was called "captain" at the time).
When McGraw heard the news, he immediately went to visit his former coach, begging him for a chance to play on the new team. Kenney had seen a lot of baseball by this time, and doubted that his former pitcher's one great pitch (the "outcurve," as it was called) would work as effectively against professional competition. Yet the man liked the teenaged McGraw very much, and when the boy insisted that he could play any position available, Kenney decided to give him a chance. McGraw signed his first contract to play professional baseball on April 1, 1890.
Olean was located 200 miles from Truxton, and this was the furthest the youngster had ever traveled from his hometown. His debut with his new team was inauspicious and short-lived. He began the season on the bench. After two days, Kenney inserted him into the starting lineup at third base. McGraw would describe the moment of his first fielding chance decades later:
or the life of me, I could not run to get it. It seemed like an age before I could get the ball in my hands and then, as I looked over to first, it seemed like the longest throw I ever had to make. The first baseman was the tallest in the league, but I threw the ball far over his head.
Seven more errors in nine more chances followed that day, a debacle that McGraw would not soon forget. After the team opened with no wins in six contests, Kenney and the other members of the ownership of the team—in the face of attendance that had dwindled to nearly nothing—were forced to overhaul the team. McGraw was given his release from the team, but Kenney also loaned him $70 and wished him luck if he wanted to try to catch on with another squad. McGraw could not bear the thought of going home a failure, as both his father and Mary Goddard had urged him to stay home and take a regular job, instead of chasing his dream of being a ballplayer. McGraw was resolute in his determination to make a name for himself as a professional baseball player, even if that meant struggling along in poverty for a time.
Thus it was that he began his journey again, this time in Wellsville, New York, a team that played in the Western New York League. The level of baseball played there was the lowest of the minor leagues, and McGraw still struggled with his fielding. But during his 24-game stint with the club, he managed to hit .365, flashing a glimpse of what would later become his hitting prowess. On October 1, 1890, he finished his first season as a professional baseball player, still only 17 years old.
After that first season, McGraw caught on with the traveling team of flamboyant promoter and fellow player, Al Lawson. Then only 21 himself, Lawson had gathered a ragtag group of players. These he took to Gainesville, Florida, in February 1891, hoping to play against major league teams who were training in the area. After defeating a team from Ocala a couple of times, Lawson began calling his team "the champions of Florida," and was able to convince the major league team from Cleveland to play against his team. It was during this game that McGraw gained his first notoriety as a player. The Cleveland squad was led by Denton True "Cy" Young, who had already become famous for his "cyclone"-like fastball.
While the young Gainesville club lost the game 9–6, McGraw managed three doubles in five at-bats. He also scored half his team's six runs, crossing the plate three times. He played error-free defense at shortstop as well. Reports of the game—and his masterful play in it—made it to the Cleveland papers. McGraw's name began to become widely known after other daily papers as well as some national baseball weeklies, such as "The Sporting News." Shortly (around a week), McGraw heard from many professional clubs requesting his services for the upcoming season.
Lawson acted as the boy's agent and advised him to request $125 monthly and a $75 advance. The manager of the Cedar Rapids club in the Illinois-Iowa League was the first to wire the money and McGraw decided to make that his next stop. It was later claimed by several other clubs that McGraw had signed with them and had accepted their $75 advances. Though they threatened to sue, the clubs were never able to substantiate these claims and McGraw was allowed to play in the league.
It was with the Canaries—as his Cedar Rapids club was called—that his greatest opportunity would arise. The Chicago White Stockings arrived in town for an exhibition game against McGraw's team. The White Stockings were led by Adrian "Cap" Anson, the major league's first true superstar. Unfazed by his famous opponents, the brash young McGraw led his teammates in giving their foes a hard time. During the game, on a field covered in mud, McGraw made a dazzling play at shortstop, leaping high to steal a hit from Cap Anson. After the game, Anson—impressed with the 18-year-old's solid play—asked him whether he would like to play for Chicago's team some day, which greatly increased the young man's confidence.
When the call came for McGraw to report to the major leagues—the Baltimore club specifically—his teammates accompanied him to the rail station. McGraw arrived at Camden Station in Baltimore on August 24, 1891, still only 18 years old, but now a major league baseball player. McGraw described his new home upon his arrival as "a dirty, dreary, ramshackle sort of place."
In the major leagues.
McGraw made his major league debut in 1891 in the American Association with the Baltimore Orioles. After the Orioles moved to the National League a year later, he remained with the team until 1899. During this time, McGraw established himself as an adept batsman with a keen eye, and an excellent third baseman. He walked over 100 times in a season three times, scored over 100 runs in a season five times, batted .320 or higher in every year from 1893 on, and also boasted an on-base percentage of .400 or higher in every year from 1893 on, including a career high mark of .547 in 1899. McGraw also took on managerial duties for the 1899 Oriole team and posted an 86–62 record.
McGraw's playing time diminished over the following years as he played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1900), the American League Baltimore Orioles (1901–1902) and the New York Giants (1902–1906). 1902 was his last season as a full-time player; he never played in more than 12 games or tallied more than 12 at bats in any season thereafter. He retired having accumulated 1,024 runs, 13 home runs, 462 RBI, a .334 batting average and a .466 on-base percentage. His .466 career on-base percentage remains third all-time behind only baseball legends Ted Williams (.482) and Babe Ruth (.474).
As a manager.
Despite great success as a player, McGraw is most remembered for his tremendous accomplishments as a manager. In his book "The Old Ball Game," National Public Radio's Frank Deford calls McGraw, "the model for the classic American coach—a male version of the whore with a heart of gold—a tough, flinty so-and-so who was field-smart, a man's man his players came to love despite themselves." McGraw took chances on players, signing some who had been discarded by other teams, often getting a few more good seasons out of them. Sometimes these risks paid off; other times, they did not work out quite so well. McGraw took a risk in signing famed athlete Jim Thorpe. Alas, Thorpe was a bust, not because he lacked athletic ability, but because "he couldn't hit a ball that curved." McGraw was one of the first to use a relief pitcher to save games. He pitched Claude Elliott in relief eight times in his ten appearances in 1905. Though saves were not an official statistic until 1969, Elliot was retroactively credited with six saves that season, a record at that time.
Over 33 years as a manager with the Baltimore Orioles of both leagues (1899 NL, 1901–1902 AL) and New York Giants (1902–1932), McGraw compiled 2,763 wins and 1,948 losses for a .586 winning percentage. His teams won 10 National League pennants, three World Series championships and had 11 second place finishes while posting only two losing records. In 1918 he broke Fred Clarke's major league record of 1,670 career victories; he was later passed by Mack. McGraw led the Giants to first place each year from 1921 to 1924, becoming the only National League manager to win four consecutive pennants. At the time of his retirement, McGraw had been ejected from games 131 times (at least 14 of these came as a player). This record would stand until Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox broke it on August 14, 2007.
In 1919, McGraw became a part-owner of the Giants when Charles Stoneham bought the club. As part of the deal, he became vice president of the Giants, with complete authority over the baseball side of the operation. However, he'd had more or less a free hand in baseball matters since his arrival. McGraw wrote an autobiography of his years in baseball, published in 1923, in which he expressed grudging respect for several opposing players. He retired as manager midway through the 1932 season, but returned to manage the National League team in the inaugural 1933 All-Star Game.
Although for most of his career McGraw wore the same baseball uniform his players wore, he eventually took a page out of Mack's book toward the end of his career and began managing in a three piece suit. He continued to do so until his retirement.
Posthumous honors.
McGraw was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937; his plaque stated that he was considered the greatest assessor of baseball talent. In honor of the days he spent coaching at St. Bonaventure, St. Bonaventure University named its athletic fields after McGraw and his teammate, fellow coach and fellow Hall of Famer Hugh Jennings.
In 2011, he was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.
Although McGraw played before numbers were worn on jerseys, the Giants honor him along with their retired numbers at AT&T Park.
The John McGraw Monument stands in his hometown of Truxton.

An alleged conversation of Gasan's was integrated into the famous American collection 101 Zen Stories:
Although given the fact that Christianity was not introduced in Japan until significantly after Gasan's death, this story is likely apocryphal. Another explanation is that the story in "Zen Flesh, Zen Bones" writes "Gasan" but means Gisan Zenkai, a 19th century Zen Master. Different editions of "Zen Flesh, Zen Bones" show the Gisan/Gasan mixup, a 19th century figure would make the story more plausible.

Ome Henk

Ome Henk ("Uncle Henk"), is the main character of a Dutch CD, DVD and comic series of the same name. The Ome Henk CDs consist of stories which depend on dialogue and sound effects, and songs, some of which are parodies.
Ome Henk is a character created and performed by actor Frank van der Plas. He is portrayed as a cranky, unemployed, and often aggressive old man living in the fictitious town of Biggeveen, which is full of other obnoxious, feeble-minded and otherwise extraordinary characters. The stories on the Ome Henk CDs highlight these various personalities and build up to many painful and embarrassing situations. The sketches have an absurd, caricatural character, and traditionally end with an explosion. Ome Henk's songs are about daily nuisances and other topics of interest to a grouchy old man. They're built upon (sometimes spoken) couplets and refrains and often feature a lively crowd, cheering and singing along. This makes the songs very suitable for après-ski and carnival parties. While his music and sketches form the most important part of his body of work, Ome Henk and his neighbors also appear in cartoons drawn by cartoonist Eric Schreurs and in live comedic sketches.
His most well-known song is "Opblaaskrokodil" ("Inflatable crocodile"), which was used by animator Andrew Kepple to make the popular soramimi animutation "French Erotic Film."

__TOC__
New School.
Beaumont Leys school was not always the building it is today but was part of the Building Schools for the Future scheme and as a result a brand new building was designed and opened in early 2009. The £14,000,000 school won two awards at the PfS (Partnerships for Schools) awards one being the BSF Excellence award and the other the BSF Grand Prix excellence award. The new school is painted in a multitude of different colours, including red, blue, green, pink, yellow and orange, which serve to make it a much brighter and engaging environment. Features of note are the dance studio, drama hall, main hall, two main entrances, multi-thousand pound equipment and top teachers from around Leicester.
Royal Visit.
On 29 March 2010, His Royal Highness, The Earl of Wessex flew in by helicoptering to the school.

Cheonhado

The Cheonhado (hangul:천하도, hanja:, literally "Map of the world beneath the heavens"), or sometimes Cheonha jeondo (hangul:천하전도, hanja:, literally "Complete map of the world beneath the heavens"), is a peculiar type of circular world map developed in Korea during the 17th century. It is based on the Korean term for map, "jido", translated roughly as "land picture".
Description.
The "Cheonhado" maps were made in response to the encounter with the geographical knowledge of the West, but based in content on traditional Asian sources and Asian in style. The structure of the maps consists of an internal continent with historical place names, an internal sea with place names connected to descriptions of Taoist immortality, an external continent, and an external sea. Surprisingly, the maps did not reflect the highest levels of geographic knowledge available to Koreans, but this is not likely to be intentional. Some of this was due to the nautical distance between Korea and other Southeast Asian locales affected the mapmakers perceptions of Asia. Similarly, European mapmakers of the day often treated Korea as an island.
Some scholars have attributed the development of Korean circular world maps to Western influence, such as the maps of Matteo Ricci ("Kunyu Wanguo Quantu") or the maps of Giulio Aleni ("Wanguo Quantu"). In this case, the central landmass can be viewed as a combination of Asia, Africa, and Europe, and the external "ring" continent as North America and South America.
Such maps were produced in Korea only, and have not been found in China or Japan.
The Cheonhado remained popular in Korea until the late 19th century.

The Alvis 12/70 was introduced by Alvis cars in 1937. It was a four-cylinder sports saloon or coupé related to the pricier six-cylinder Alvis Silver Crest.
Alvis designed and manufactured the four-cylinder 1,842 cc pushrod overhead valve engine which was similar to the engine of the Alvis Firebird but was, in fact, a new design. Its was enough to propel the car to a top speed of about . Alvis also designed and made the four-speed gearbox which had synchromesh on the top three speeds.
Many of the other components were outsourced to other suppliers in a bid to cut costs. The most common (saloon or drophead coupé) bodywork was by Mulliners of Birmingham.
A total of 741 cars was manufactured until 1940, with 121 still surviving. In 1945 the 12/70 was replaced by the modernized Alvis TA 14, but much of the 12/70 lived on in this post war model.

Exercise is Medicine

Exercise is Medicine is a nonprofit initiative launched by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Medical Association (AMA).
Overview.
The initiative calls for physical activity and exercise to be standard parts of disease prevention and medical treatment, urging healthcare providers to assess and review patients’ physical activity programs at every visit, with office visits that conclude exercise clearance and a prescription or referral to a qualified health/fitness professional. In addition, patients are encouraged to begin a conversation with their doctor about physical activity, and to learn how to best continue or improve upon their exercise regimens.
Exercise is crucial to the prevention, management, and treatment of numerous chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure and other medical problems. Although exercise clearly benefits the appearance of the body, the Exercise is Medicine program focuses more on the internal benefits of physical activity and how these benefits contribute to the longevity and quality of life.
The Exercise is Medicine program was launched on Nov. 5, 2007, in Washington, D.C. In addition to leaders from ACSM and AMA, Rear Admiral Stephen K. Galson (the acting Surgeon General of the United States) spoke at the event.
The initiative also includes “May-Kit Happen,” a commemorative program that launched in May 2008, asking people to incorporate a little more physical activity into their lives and to talk to their physicians during the month of May about what types of exercises are best suited to their circumstances.
State involvement.
Many states, including Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia proclaimed May as Exercise is Medicine month. Several cities also have pledged support by creating events featuring the “May-Kit Happen” principles, including Indianapolis, IN, Tallahassee, FL, Eugene, OR and several cities in Texas.
Supporters.
Numerous organizations have signed on in support of the Exercise is Medicine program, well known supporters include the American Academy of Family Physicians,the American College of Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,the American College of Preventive Medicine, the American Council on Exercise, the American Heart Association, the American Optometric Association, the American Osteopathic Association, the American Physical Therapy Association, Bastyr University, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the National Athletic Trainers' Association, President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, Project ACES, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, the USA Triathlon, the University of Florence and various branches of the YMCA, including that of the United States as a whole.

Castra Nova equitum singularium

The Castra Nova equitum singularium was an ancient Roman fort in Rome housing part of the emperor's cavalry bodyguard. The site of the fort now lies beneath the Basilica of St John Lateran.
The "Castra Nova", or "new fort", was one of two cavalry forts that provided a base in Rome for the mounted bodyguard of the Roman emperors (the "Equites singulares Augusti").
The Castra Nova ("new fort") was so-called because it was the newer of the two forts, built to house an enlargement of the cavalry guard. Their previous fort "Castra Prioria" which lay not far away to the north had been built earlier, possibly under the emperor Domitian, and still housed the original force of 1500 mounted troopers. The full name of the fort is "Castra nova Equitum singularium Augusti".
History.
The fort can be precisely dated to AD 193, at the beginning of the reign of Septimius Severus. The new camp was necessitated by this emperors increase of the size of his cavalry guard from 1,500 to 2,000 men. 
The site of the camp was always speculated as being beneath the cathedral of St John Lateran (Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano), but it was identified definitively by excavations between 1934 and 1938 undertaken by Enrico Josi. Josi had obtained permission to explore the area of the basilica’s nave in advance of the construction of a new reinforced concrete floor. Within days it became clear that the remains of the Castra Nova existed in good condition just below the floor level and that the excavation was including a large part of the "principia" (headquarters) building. The completed excavations were then published by Colini.
A large two-storey storage building and two barracks were also uncovered, but the greatest interest centered around the "principia" as its two strong rooms were very well preserved as were several office rooms. On the completion of the investigation the remains were preserved beneath the basilica (along with the remains of the Constantinian cathedral and a Neronian "domus") in a spectacular underground archaeological park.
The "curatores" inscriptions.
On August 13, 1934, an ionic capital was uncovered within one of the headquarters rooms (room “ε” on plan above), lying beside a short granite column that was still set into the floor. Upon the capital two inscriptions had been carved on behalf of an association of "curatores", soldiers who were the grooms for the garrison horses. The first text was dedicated in 197 AD on 1 January in the consulship of Rufinus and Lateranus. The "Equites" were known to have served at the Battle of Lyon on the 19th of February, though evidently these men did not. The inscription records the dedication of the "schola curatorum" to Minerva Augusta, indicating that the "collegium curatorum" itself had only recently become in possession of an official meeting room that they could consecrate. 
The second inscription was dedicated in 203 AD "ob reditum ab expeditione felicissima in urvem sacram" i.e. on the return of the guards to Rome following their escorting of the imperial family. The "expeditione felicissima" may refer to the entire series of events since the "equites singulares Augusti" left Rome in AD 197. 
The toppling of the capital furthermore provided historical evidence attesting to the destruction of the Castra Nova by Constantine’s forces and providing a "terminus ante quem" for both the dissolution of the "collegium" as well as for the camp itself.

Falsterbo Lighthouse

Falsterbo Lighthouse () lies near the site of the oldest known beacon in Scandinavia. To the north-east of the lighthouse is the city of Skanör-Falsterbo, to the south-east of the lighthouse are some of the finest sandy beaches in Sweden and surrounding the lighthouse is the golf course of the Falsterbo Golf Club.
History.
The sea route past the Falsterbo Headland has always been dangerous, because of the moving sand banks hidden under the sea. The first beacon was lit by German monks back in the 13th century. At that time Falsterbo was an important trading centre in Denmark. The beacon was placed at the then outermost point. When the trading became less important (16th century) there were periods without any beacon at Falsterbo. This caused a great loss of ships off the coast of Falsterbo.
In the 1630s the open fires were replaced by a lever light. An iron basket full of burning coal was hoisted up and down by a balanced bar. Hence the light was moving and easier to detect. The coal fire was intensely red and could not be mistaken for a star or ship lantern. The remains of the beacon are still visible as a small hillock of ashes and coal, "Coal Hill" (). Towards the end of the 18th century the lever light was moved to the site of the present lighthouse, closer to the new shoreline.
The lighthouse was built in 1793-96 and the "light" was a coal fire at the top. In 1842-43 the uppermost crenellated parts were replaced with the present lantern. Coal was replaced with rapeseed oil. The oil was very inflammable and the lighthouse keepers had to watch the lamp all night. To make a periodic light; a screen was moved around the lantern by heavy weights. Around 1850 a house for the keeper was built next to the lighthouse. At the end of the 19th century another house was built for the assistants to the lighthouse keeper.
Also when the oil was replaced with paraffin and, later gas, the screen still had to be moved around. When electric light was installed in 1935 the screen was removed and so were most of the staff. Only one lighthouse keeper remained. In 1972 the lighthouse was automated and the last keeper retired.
The lighthouse is high and broad. Nowadays it has no importance as a navigation mark and therefore the light is not very strong (ca. 4000 candela). It was totally turned off 1990-93. The interval of the light is intermittent: 4 seconds on, 1 second off, repeated.
Present Activities.
Even though the lighthouse is managing itself nowadays, there are still lots of activities around it. Falsterbo is one of twenty synoptic weather stations in Sweden still manned. Every three hours weather data (wind, temperature, air pressure, visibility, cloud cover etc.) are reported to the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. In earlier days the weather observations were carried out by the lighthouse keepers.
The lighthouse garden is the ringing site of the Falsterbo Bird Observatory. Falsterbo is a premier site in Europe to watch autumn bird migration. Several millions of birds pass every autumn en route to wintering areas in Africa or southern Europe. Annually, about 25,000 small birds are trapped and ringed.
Every year on the last Sunday of August it is "Lighthouse Day". Then the lighthouse is open to the public. Visitors are shown not only the lighthouse itself but also bird ringing and the weather station.

<doc id="18571664" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18571664" title="Nepalese Rastriya Panchayat election, 1981">
Nepalese Rastriya Panchayat election, 1981

Elections were held to the Rastriya Panchayat (National Council) in Nepal on 9 May 1981. 80% of the seats were elected through adult universal suffrage; this was the first election through universal suffrage held in Nepal in 22 years. However, political parties were banned at the time, and the main underground opposition forces (the Nepali Congress and various communist groups) called for a boycott of the election.
The election were the first to be held after the 1980 constitutional amendment. In total there were 112 elected seats, whilst 28 were appointed by the King. According to official reports, 63% of the eligible voters took part in the polls. However, there were some inconsistencies in the report of voting numbers. Voter turnout was 52.2%.
Constituencies.
40 out of the 75 districts of Nepal formed two-member constituencies whilst the less populated 35 districts formed single-member constituencies. The 15 mountain districts were all single-member constituencies. The hill districts elected 57 seats, the inner-terai districts eight seats and the terai districts 32 seats.
Campaign.
Initially there were 1,451 total candidates, of whom 353 later withdrew. 70 of the candidates, spread over 43 different districts, had also contested the 1959 parliamentary election. Virtually all candidates campaigned on slogans such as "God and Motherhood", portraying themselves as opponents of corruption and inflation. With the absence of organised political parties in the election, the campaign was rather low-scale. Mass rallies were not held, not even in Kathmandu. Most candidates relied heavily on door-to-door campaigning and canvassing through family, caste and ethnic networks. Candidates also used posters and vehicles with loudspeakers. The spending ceiling of each candidate was fixed at 30,000 Nepalese rupees.
Candidates had to pay a security deposit of 1,500 Nepalese rupees in order to contest the election.
Results.
The incumbent prime minister, Surya Bahadur Thapa, contested and was elected from the Dhankuta district. He got 40,546 votes in total. Two pre-"panchayat" prime ministers contested the election, Matrika Prasad Koirala and Dr. K.I. Singh. Matrika Prasad Koirala contested in the Morang district. He was supported, unofficially, by Surya Bahadur Thapa. Koirala did however lose the election, whilst K.I. Singh was elected.
Overall, the result was a setback for the ruling elite. Although all candidates were officially independents, various candidates were well known as having the backing of the government. In total about 70% of the "official" candidates lost their seats. In the elected Rastriya Panchayat, there were 57 newcomers to the assembly.
The defeats of the officialist side was partially due to divisions inside the officialist camp. In Morang district the royal house and the prime minister supported opposing candidates, eventually resulting in the defeat for both.
The candidate who received the highest number of votes was Hem Bahadur Malla, a cabinet minister. Malla got 76,720 votes. The elected member with the lowest number of votes was Tej Bahadur Bham, who got 3,137 votes.
Whilst the Nepali Congress leadership had called for boycott, the dissident fraction led by Bakhan Singh Gurung had launched 36 candidates. Four of them were elected; Dr. K.I. Singh, Bakhan Singh Gurung, Kashi Nath Gautam and Bhagwat Yadav. The pro-Soviet Communist Party led by Keshar Jung Rayamajhi had launched over 45-50 candidates, but none got elected.
Some independent leftwing candidates were elected, such as Govinda Nath Upreti (Kavre), Rup Chandra Bista (Makwanpur) and Karna Bahadur Hyuju (Bhaktapur). Other independent supporters of reintroducing parliamentary democracy who were elected were Shribhadra Sharma, Arjun Narsingh K.C. and Prakash Chandra Lohani.
Twenty-eight women candidates contested the election, out of whom two were elected; Nani Mainya Dahal and Bhadra Kumari Ghale. Dahal, a relatively unknown person in Nepalese politics at the time, swept the Kathmandu district polls. Her election was seen as a mistrust vote against the establishment.

Sailor's Creek Battlefield Historical State Park

Sailor's Creek Battlefield State Park is a park in Virginia. It includes a portion of the landmarked Sayler's Creek Battlefield, an area of that was the site of the 1865 Battle of Sayler's Creek in the American Civil War. It is also likely that some of the park is not included in the four separated parcels that were landmarked.
The park includes picnic tables and barbecue grills available for use.
The Overton-Hillsman House was used as a field hospital during and after the battle, and is open to visitors in the summer and by request. The park also hosts living history events during the year.
The park name appears to be a further misspelling of Saylor, a farmer after whose land the Battle of Sayler's Creek was named in 1865. Some official records such as those of the National Historic Landmark program refer to this park as being named the Sayler's Creek Battlefield State Park.

James Kennedy (historian)

James Carleton Kennedy (born 1963 in Orange City, Iowa) is an American historian. He is the son of E.W. (Bill) and Nella Kennedy. The elder Dr. Kennedy was for years an eminent professor of religion at Northwestern College (Iowa).
Biography.
Kennedy grew up in Orange City, a reformed village consisting mainly of descendants of the Netherlands. His mother came also from that country.
He studied foreign service at Georgetown University, obtaining his B.S. in 1986, Christian studies at Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan, obtaining his M.A. in 1988, and took his PhD in history from the University of Iowa in 1995.
He performed several jobs in the field of history before becoming an assistant professor of European history and research fellow at the A. C. Van Raalte Institute, Hope College in Holland, Michigan in 1997.
In 2003 he moved to the Netherlands because he was appointed a professor of modern history (20th century) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In 2007 he changed to the University of Amsterdam, where he became a professor of the history of the Netherlands. In 2009 he succeeded professor Piet de Rooy, head of the section of the history of the Netherlands.
Kennedy takes a special interest in post-war Dutch history. Because of his Christian belief he considers himself a Christian historian although he is reserved to point out how God is guiding human history.
Politically, he characterizes himself as an independent. However, in the presidential campaign of 2004 he was in favor of John Kerry, the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
James Kennedy is married to Simone Kennedy-Doornbos, a local Dutch politician for the ChristianUnion in Amersfoort. They have three children. The Kennedy family is a member of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated), an orthodox reformed denomination.

Humanitarian engineering

Humanitarian engineering is research and design to directly improve the wellbeing of marginalized or under-served communities. Humanitarian engineering places strong emphasis on the cultural context of engaging in engineering activities which impact the poor, the marginalized, the disenfranchised, and those that lack the means to address pressing problems.
Training for one who participates in humanitarian engineering incorporates history, politics, economics, sociology, language, as well as rigorous engineering basics. Several universities in the United States focus efforts on Humanitarian Engineering: Penn State University integrates engineering design and research with a strong social entrepreneurship thrust. Colorado School of Mines offers a minor in Humanitarian Engineering. The Ohio State University has many local and international service projects, courses, and research in Humanitarian Engineering: [https://osuhe.engineering.osu.edu]. Arizona State University offers a 3-course humanitarian engineering/entrepreneurship capstone as a part of the GlobalResolve program.

Mark M. Noble

Mark Michael Noble (born July 3, 1976) is a computer engineer and Libertarian Party politician in Ohio.
Early life and education.
Noble was born in Columbus, Ohio. He is a graduate of Ohio State University.
Political career.
In 2006, Noble ran for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio on the Libertarian ticket with Bill Peirce, the party's nomination for governor. Peirce and Noble finished third with 67,596 votes, 1.8 percent of the total vote behind winner Ted Strickland, the Democratic nominee, and runner-up Ken Blackwell, the Republican nominee, and ahead of Green Party candidate, Bob Fitrakis.
In 2008, Noble ran for U.S. Representative for Ohio's 15th congressional district. Noble successfully challenged Ohio's ballot access laws, which the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled unconstitutional, and qualified for the ballot. He finished third with 4.6 percent of the vote.
Noble is currently the chairman of the Franklin County Libertarian Party. He was elected to that position in 2006 and re-elected in 2008.
His campaign for gun rights garnered him national publicity in 2007, including coverage of the Empty Holster Protest by Fox News.
Previously, Noble has campaigned on platforms including policies of reduced regulation, lower taxes, personal responsibility, reform of eminent domain abuse, parental choice, and an adherence to the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
Constitutional challenge.
Following a successful challenge to the unconstitutional ballot access laws with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in 2008, Noble was able to officially mount his candidacy for House of Representatives, Ohio's 15th district.
On 6 June 2008, the Libertarian Party of Ohio, by application of Mark Noble and several Libertarian Party of Ohio colleagues (Kevin Knedler, Bob Barr, Wayne Root, and Margaret Leech) as plaintiffs, filed a suit (Libertarian Party of Ohio v. Brunner) against Ohio Secretary of State claiming that the Secretary of State's refusal to give the Libertarian Party of Ohio access to the November 2008 general electoral ballot deprived the "plaintiffs of speech, voting and associational rights secured by the First and Fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States."
On 21 August 2008, the court found in favor, granting an order for the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.
This case established that the Ohio Secretary of State's Directive 2007-09 for the placement of minor party candidates on the state election ballot was unconstitutional.
Victory in this case required the Ohio Secretary of State to list minor party political candidates with party affiliation on the ballot without the strict petitioning requirements of major parties. In the 2008 presidential election this resulted in eight candidates on the ballot for president representing six political parties (along with two independents).
The importance of this case lies in establishing ballot access for all candidates, regardless of party affiliation (and in particular, without favor to the 'big two'). Because each state establishes its own laws on how a candidate may be listed on the ballot, ballot access laws can be regarded as a significant impediment to the open process of democracy. Given Noble's Libertarian focus on constitutionality, the challenge to the Ohio ballot access regulations represents a major ideological event for the Libertarian Party, as well as a practical matter for third-party candidates in Ohio elections.
As a result of the win, the Libertarian Party was allowed on the ballot in Ohio, with party brand. This was only the third time in the history of the Libertarian Party of Ohio that party brand has been on the ballot line.

Petrie polygon

In geometry, a Petrie polygon for a regular polytope of "n" dimensions is a skew polygon such that every ("n"-1) consecutive sides (but no "n") belong to one of the facets. The Petrie polygon of a regular polygon is the regular polygon itself; that of a regular polyhedron is a skew polygon such that every two consecutive sides (but no three) belong to one of the faces.
For every regular polytope there exists an orthogonal projection onto a plane such that one Petrie polygon becomes a regular polygon with the remainder of the projection interior to it. The plane in question is the Coxeter plane of the symmetry group of the polygon, and the number of sides, "h," is Coxeter number of the Coxeter group. These polygons and projected graphs are useful in visualizing symmetric structure of the higher dimensional regular polytopes.
History.
John Flinders Petrie (1907-1972) was the only son of Egyptologist Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie. He was born in 1907 and as a schoolboy showed remarkable promise of mathematical ability. In periods of intense concentration he could answer questions about complicated four-dimensional objects by "visualizing" them. 
He first realized the importance of the regular skew polygons which appear on the surface of regular polyhedra and higher polytopes. He was a lifelong friend of Coxeter, who named these polygons after him.
The idea of Petrie polygons was later extended to semiregular polytopes.
In 1972, a few months after his retirement, Petrie was killed by a car while attempting to cross a motorway near his home in Surrey.
The Petrie polygons of the regular polyhedra.
The Petrie polygon of the regular polyhedron {"p", "q"} has "h" sides, where 
The regular duals, {p,q} and {q,p}, are contained within the same projected Petrie polygon.
The Petrie polygon of regular polychora (4-polytopes).
The Petrie polygon for the regular polychora {"p", "q" ,"r"} can also be determined.
The Petrie polygon projections of regular and uniform polytopes.
The Petrie polygon projections are most useful for visualization of polytopes of dimension four and higher. This table represents Petrie polygon projections of 3 regular families (simplex, hypercube, orthoplex), and the exceptional Lie group En which generate semiregular and uniform polytopes for dimensions 4 to 8.

Edward Weidenfeld

Edward L. Weidenfeld, is the former counsel to the United States House Committee on Insular Affairs from 1971-1973 and counsel to the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign. As the founder of the Weidenfeld Law Firm, P.C. in Washington, D.C., he is an attorney specializing in estate and asset protection law. He also serves as co-chair of the Board of Visitors of the National Defense University, is a board member and chairman of the Executive Committee of the Center for the Study of the Presidency, and sits on the Advisory Board of the Bureau of National Affairs. Weidenfeld was named one of the Top 75 lawyers in Washington by Washingtonian (magazine) in 2002.
Participation in government.
Weidenfeld was Counsel and Staff Director of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs from 1971–1973. Three Presidents appointed Weidenfeld to advisory positions, including the President’s Commission on White House Fellows in 1977 and the Council on Administrative Conference of the United States in 1981, 1985 and 1988. He was named a senior fellow to the Council on Administrative Conference in 1991. 
In 1982, Weidenfeld was appointed Chairman of the Advisory Panel for Foreign Disaster Relief by then Administrator of the Agency for International Development, Peter McPherson.
Participation in democratic initiatives.
In 1983, Weidenfeld was appointed co-counsel to the Democracy Project, whose charge was structuring the National Endowment for Democracy. Among other international projects in his law practice during this time, Mr. Weidenfeld negotiated the first free exchange between the U.S. media and Novisti, the Soviet News Agency. He also represented the Government of South Africa following Nelson Mandela’s election in 1984.
Notable private sector cases.
In 1973 Weidenfeld represented the Domestic Ammonia Industry before the United States International Trade Commission to ask for a curb on ammonia imports from the Soviet Union, which the industry argued was exporting ammonia to the United States at below-cost prices. The United States International Trade Commission agreed, and recommended that then-President Jimmy Carter impose a three-year quota that would halve previously forecast imports of ammonia from the Soviet Union.
Weidenfeld also served as Counsel to and sat on the board of Imatron Inc. and InVision Technologies during the 1980s and 1990s. Imatron is a medical equipment manufacturer and was bought by General Electric in 2001. In 1990 InVision Technologies was spun out of Imatron and developed the first bomb-detection-machine using the same technology that is used for CAT Scans. InVision remains one of only two companies licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration to sell automatic bomb-detection scanners for airports.
In 1999, Weidenfeld helped facilitate the return of Major League Baseball to Cuba for the first time in 40 years, participating in months of discussions with the United States Department of State, the Cuban Government, the MLB Commissioner’s office, the Baltimore Orioles and the MLB Players Association.
Relationship with Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Lau kata kati

Lau kata kati is a two-player abstract strategy game from India, specifically from Lower Bengal, United Provinces, Karwi Subdivision where it is called Kowwu Dunki. The game is related to Draughts and even more so to Alquerque. Pieces are captured by hopping over them, and the board is composed of two triangle grids. It is the same game as Butterfly (game) from Mozambique, which suggests a historical connection between the two games. Lau kata kati belongs to a specific category of games called Indian War-games, and the other games in this category are Dash-guti, Egara-guti, Pretwa, Gol-skuish. All Indian War-games have one important thing in common, and that is that all the pieces are laid out on the grid patterned board, with only one vacant point in the center. This forces the first move to be played on the central point, and captured by the other player's piece. 
It is important to realize that Lau kata kati's board is the basis of other games, in particular, Dash-guti and Egara-guti. In serves as a basis for other games in the same way that the Alquerque board and the draughts board is a basis for other games. 
Lau kata kati is also known as Lau kati kata and Nau Keti Keta. 
Goal.
To capture all of the opponent's pieces, or be the one with more pieces when no more pieces can be taken by either player, or stalemate the other opponent's pieces such that they are immobilized.
Equipment.
The board is two triangles connected together at a common vertex. The triangles are divided by two lines across their breadth which forms the second and third ranks, and a single line runs down the length of both triangles through the common vertex. Pieces are played on the intersection points, and there are a total of 19 intersection points.
Each player has 9 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however any two colors or distinguishable objects will do.

Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer (1 January 1791 Hanover, Brunswick-Lüneburg – 7 August 1858 Königsberg, East Prussia) was a German botanist and botanical historian. Born in Hanover, he lectured in Göttingen and in 1826 became a professor of botany at the University of Königsberg, as well as Director of the Botanical Garden. His botanical specialty was the Juncaceae, or family of rushes. His major work was the four-volume "Geschichte der Botanik" (“History of Botany,” 1854–57). His history covered ancient authorities such as Aristotle and Theophrastus, explored the beginnings of modern botany in the context of 15th- and 16th-century intellectual practice, and offered a wealth of biographical data on early modern botanists. Julius von Sachs pronounced him “no great botanist” but admitted that he “possessed a clever and cultivated intellect.”
During his time as private tutor at the University of Göttingen he made the acquaintance of Goethe, who had a surprising passion for botany.
The fourth volume of "Geschichte der Botanik" is available online. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation E.Mey. when citing a botanical name.

Francis Paul Prucha (born January 4, 1921) is an American Jesuit, historian, and professor emeritus of history at Marquette University. His work "The Great Father" was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and is regarded as a classic among professional historians.
Biography.
Prucha was born on January 4, 1921, in River Falls, Wisconsin, the first son to Edward J. and Katharine Prucha and the older brother of John J. Prucha. He was educated at Wisconsin State Teachers College, at River Falls, which awarded him a Bachelors of Science degree in 1941. After a year and a half of high school teaching and then three and a half of service in the United States Army Air Force, he enrolled in the University of Minnesota and received an M.A. degree in 1947. Harvard University awarded him a Ph.D. degree in history in 1950 under the direction of Frederick Merk. His dissertation, a study of the role of the peacetime army in the settlement process, was published in 1953 as Broadax and Bayonet: The Role of the United States Army in the Development of the Northwest, 1815-1860.
Prucha joined the Society of Jesus in 1950 and was ordained in 1957 after studying at Saint Louis University and Saint Mary's College in St. Marys, Kansas. Three years later he began teaching at Marquette and is remembered by generations of alumni as a model of the teacher-scholar. Since 1960 he has been on the history faculty at Marquette University. He has served as visiting professor at the University of Oklahoma and at Harvard and was the Gasson Professor at Boston College. When the editor of Marquette Magazine recently asked readers to write about their greatest teachers, Father Prucha was identified among a group of classroom legends."Of all the teachers I've had," wrote Richard Hryniewicki (A&S '61, MA '63), "Father Prucha did the most to instill a love of learning, a quest for knowledge, and practicing work ethic."
In the late 1960s, while studying under a Guggeheim Fellowship, Prucha began work on a comprehensive history of U.S. Indian policy. His research culminated with the two-volume . The book was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in history in 1985 and is regarded as a classic among professional historians. The Great Father was awarded the Billington Prize by the Organization of American Historians in 1985. The recipient of six honorary degrees, Prucha was awarded his emeritus appointment in 1988.
Father Prucha is also the author or editor of 25 other books of numerous articles, and scores of book reviews. He is known internationally for his expertise on the American West and United States policy towards Native Americans. Prucha also helped to establish Marquette’s rich research collections documenting Catholicism among Native Americans. As a tribute to Prucha, Marquette University's Archives and Special Collection's reading room in its newly constructed Raynor Library was named in his honor. Father Prucha was also inducted into the Milwaukee Central Library’s Wisconsin Writers Wall of Fame.
Prucha currently resides in the Jesuit Residence on Marquette University's campus.
Archival collections.
Prucha was instrumental in acquiring for Marquette University the records of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions. There is also a collection that relates purely to Prucha and his work. The archival collections of Francis Paul Prucha includes his correspondence, books (1950–2002), articles, book reviews (1942–2002), public talks and lectures (1956–1998), courses taught (1952–1987), awards and honors (1971–2003), professional activities, research fellowships and grants (1954–2003), personal papers (1927–1993), and research materials (1955–2003).

Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center

The Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (VBRC) is an online resource providing access to a database of curated viral genomes and a variety of tools for bioinformatic genome analysis. This resource is one of eight BRCs (Bioinformatics Resource Centers) funded by NIAID with the goal of promoting research against emerging and re-emerging pathogens, particularly those seen as potential bioterrorism threats. The VBRC is supported by researchers at the University of Victoria and University of Alabama at Birmingham.
The curated VBRC database contains all publicly available genomic sequences for seven of the virus families covered under the NIAID initiative, together with an additional six families specific to VBRC. A unique aspect of this resource relative to other genomic databases is its grouping of all annotated genes into ortholog groups (i.e. protein families) based on pre-run BLASTP sequence similarity searches.
The curated database is accessed through VOCS (Viral Orthologous Clusters), a downloadable Java-based user interface, and acts as the central information source for other programs of the VBRC workbench. These programs serve a variety of bioinformatic analysis functions (whole- or subgenome alignments, genome display, and several types of gene/protein sequence analysis). The majority of these tools are programmed to take user-supplied input as well.
Virus families covered in the VBRC database.
The VBRC covers the following viruses under its NIAID mandate:
The following virus families are also covered by Virology.ca:
Organization of the VBRC database.
The VBRC database stores viral bioinformatic data on three levels:
Central Tools Provided by VBRC.
VBRC provides researchers with a wide variety of database-linked tools. Of these, the central four programs are VOCs, VGO, BBB, and JDotter.
Other Tools Provided by VBRC.
VBRC provides a number of additional Java-based analysis tools on its website. Several are interfaces to pre-existing bioinformatics tools (e.g. napC, R’MES), while others were independently developed by VBRC. The tools in this category are each designed to perform a very specific task (e.g. regular expression searches, DNA skew plotting) and, though they can be accessed as stand-alone programs with user-supplied input, most have increased utility when launched from the central VOCS application with VBRC-supplied data.
These additional tools are as follows:

Fultz House

The Bennett Daniel Fultz House is one of the earliest houses in Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia and the community's only museum. It is located on its original land, on the corner of the "Great Roads" leading from Halifax to Truro and to the Annapolis Valley.
History.
Lower Sackville was officially created with Fort Sackville in 1749, under Captain John Gorham. The first land grant in the area was given to Colonel Joseph Scott, of the Scott Manor House, located in what is now Bedford. The Manor was completed in the 1770s.
The history of the Fultz Family begins in 1751, when a Johann Fultz left Germany, boarded the Speedwell, and traveled to Halifax. He then (according to records) made his way to Louisbourg. Before its fall in 1758, Johann Fultz, and his wife, whom he married while in Nova Scotia, Elizabeth, brought two children into the world. 
One of them, Anthony Fultz, petitioned the Crown in 1809 for land in Sackville after having received some from his father's will in 1801. In 1812 Anthony was successful, and purchased of land. Almost immediately afterwards, Fultz's Twelve Mile House began operating on the corner of the "Great Roads", serving as a rest stop for horse-drawn carriages traveling to and from Halifax. The inn was run by Anthony's son, William. The Inn included a ballroom. It was a popular stop for George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie during his period as Governor of Nova Scotia (1816 to 1820). The inn itself burned down in 1890. In spite of this tragedy, the Fultz family persevered.
Fultz House History.
In 1858, William's nephew Bennett Daniel Fultz purchased the land opposite the Twelve Mile Inn from his cousin, William Beresford Fultz. In 1863, he began building what is now colloquially known as the Fultz House. Bennett lived in the house from 1865 with his wife Mary and their eight children. 
The house was significantly modified prior to the 1900s, with the addition of a summer kitchen and second floor. Bennett and Mary served as masters of a post-office they ran from their kitchen. They died in 1910 and 1928, respectively.
Jane Emily Fultz, the sixth child of Bennett and Mary retired to the family home after the death of her father. When she died in 1947, the connection between the house and the family had finally been broken; the house moved into the possession of another family.
The Fultz House Museum.
In 1979, the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia acquired Fultz House and the surrounding land. Preparations were made to expand the "Great Roads" intersection in order to facilitate traffic. In November of that year, six Sackville community groups joined to form the Fultz Corner Restoration Society; among them were the Sackville Heritage Society (represented by Bob Harvey, a councilor with HRM District 20 today), a garden club, and a sorority. In 1980, the plans for demolition of the house were put on hold, and the house and property were leased to the society that August.
The museum opened during the months of July and August in 1981 and was officially deemed the Fultz House Museum at a grand opening on Canada Day, 1982. Since then, it has served as a gathering place for teas, Canada Day celebrations, and other community events. Descendants of the Fultz family continue to be involved in museum activities. 
In 1988, the W.J. Grace cooperage was moved to the site; in 1995, the blacksmith's forge and tools that once belonged to A. J. Smeltzer were moved to the site. The entirety of the Fultz House site became the property of the society in 1990, and in 2008, the society was granted additional land in the form of 17 Sackville Drive, hand-delivered by Premier Rodney MacDonald. 
This prized community museum is open from 10am-5pm on all days of the week throughout the months of July and August. Through provincial and federal funding the museum is able to keep history alive through the employment of a summer staff made up of post-secondary students. Admission to the museum is free of charge.

Osteolepidida

Osteolepidida are a group of prehistoric lobe-finned fishes which appears first time during the Devonian period. The order contains five families: Canowindridae, Elpistostegidae, Megalichthyidae, Osteolepidae and Tristichopteridae. The superorder is generally considered to be paraphyletic because the characters that define it are mainly attributes of stem tetrapodomorphs.
Below is a cladogram showing the paraphyly of Osteolepiformes compiled and modified from Ahlberg and Johanson (1998). See also Swartz 2012. The Osteolepiformes are marked by the green bracket.

WLF is a partner in the Bloomberg Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and, more recently, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The goal of the Initiative is to reduce tobacco use in low- and middle-income countries, where 80% of the 6 million deaths resulting from tobacco use took place in 2011. WLF = funds and supports mass media ad campaigns on the harmful effects of smoking and other forms of tobacco use. WLF has supported 80 tobacco control mass media campaigns in 20 countries.
WLF disbursed millions from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to The International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union), the World Health Organization, the Framework Convention Alliance, and the CDC Foundation to strengthen their tobacco control activities and to support its own mass media programs. Other partners in the Bloomberg Initiative are Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Maternal health.
With financial support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, WLF has implemented an emergency maternal health obstetrics program in the Kigoma, Morogoro, and Pwani provinces of Tanzania. The program has trained 50 non-physician clinicians to deliver babies via cesarian section if needed, and midwives to assist in obstetrics care. In addition, WLF has renovated twelve rural health care centers and upgraded five district hospitals. This includes building three new maternity wards and operating theatres that are fully equipped with surgical equipment and reliable supplies of electricity and clean water. 26 staff houses have also been built.
TB Center.
WLF helped fund Asia's first International Tuberculosis Center, which opened in Manila in 2008. The facility provides treatment, research, training and a steady supply of medications to combat Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) in the Philippines and across Asia. Since the opening of the center, dozens of clinicians from around the world have been trained on the best prevention, diagnosis and treatment techniques for MDR-TB.

Safety management systems

Safety management system (SMS) is a term used to refer to a comprehensive business management system designed to manage safety elements in the workplace.
Description of SMS.
A SMS provides a systematic way to identify hazards and control risks while maintaining assurance that these risk controls are effective. SMS can be defined as:
...a businesslike approach to safety. It is a systematic, explicit and comprehensive process for managing safety risks. As with all management systems, a safety management system provides for goal setting, planning, and measuring performance. A safety management system is woven into the fabric of an organization. It becomes part of the culture, the way people do their jobs.
For the purposes of defining safety management, safety can be defined as: ... the reduction of risk to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable.
There are three imperatives for adopting a safety management system for a business – these are ethical, legal and financial.
There is an implied moral obligation placed on an employer to ensure that work activities and the place of work to be safe, there are legislative requirements defined in just about every jurisdiction on how this is to be achieved and there is a substantial body of research which shows that effective safety management (which is the reduction of risk in the workplace) can reduce the financial exposure of an organisation by reducing direct and indirect costs associated with accident and incidents.
To address these three important elements, an effective SMS should:
A safety management system can be created to fit any business type and/or industry sector.
Basic safety-management components.
International Labour Organisation SMS model.
Since there are many models to choose from to outline the basic components of a safety management system, the one chosen here is the international standard promoted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). In the ILO document ILO-OSH 2001 Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems, the safety management basic components are:
Although other SMS models use different terminology, the process and workflow for safety management systems is always the same;
Regulatory Perspective.
SMS Implications.
A SMS is intended to act as a framework to allow an organisation, as a minimum, to meet its legal obligations under occupational health and safety law. The structure of a SMS is generally speaking, not of itself a legal requirement but it is an extremely effective tool to organise the myriad aspects of occupational safety and health (OSH) that can exist within an organisation, often to meet standards which exceed the minimum legal requirement. 
A SMS is only as good as its implementation – effective safety management means that organisations need to ensure they are looking at all the risks within the organization as a single system, rather than having multiple, competing, ‘Safety Management Silos.’ If safety is not seen holistically, it can interfere with the prioritization of improvements or even result in safety issues being missed. For example, after an explosion in March 2005 at BP's Texas City Refinery (BP) the investigation concluded that the company had put too much emphasis on personal safety thus ignoring the safety of their processes. The antidote to such silo thinking is the proper evaluation of all risks, a key aspect of an effective SMS.
Implementation.
Adoption of SMSs for Industry Sectors.
There are a number of industry sectors worldwide which have recognised the benefits of effective safety management. The regulatory authorities for these industries have developed safety management systems specific to their own industries and requirements, often backed up by regulation. Below are examples from different industry sectors from a number of varied worldwide locations.
Civil Aviation.
The International Civil Aviation Organization has recommended that all aviation authorities implement SMS regulatory structures. ICAO has provided resources to assist with implementation, including the [http://www2.icao.int/en/ism/Guidance%20Materials/DOC_9859_FULL_EN.pdf ICAO Safety Management Manual. Unlike the traditional occupational safety focus of SMS, the ICAO focus is to use SMS for managing aviation safety. "Id".
The ICAO High-level Safety Conference 2010 recommendation 2/5 proposed the development of a new Annex (19) dedicated to Safety Management. 
The Annex was published in February 2013 and entered into force on November 14, 2013.
The benefits identified of this approach included: 
The United States has introduced SMS for airports through an advisory circular and other guidance. 
The United States announced at the 2008 EASA/FAA/TC International Safety Conference that they would be developing regulations to implement SMS for repair stations, air carriers, and manufacturers. The FAA formed a rulemaking committee to address the implementation (known as the SMS ARC). The SMS ARC reported its findings to the FAA on March 31, 2010. The Report recognizes that many of the elements of SMS already exist in the U.S. regulations, but that some elements do not yet exist. A draft of what the US SMS rule might look like was proposed by one trade association that participated in the ARC. Currently, the FAA is supporting voluntary pilot projects for SMS.
The Federal Aviation Administration has also required that all FAA services and offices adopt a common Aviation Safety (AVS)Safety Management System (AVSSMS). This is what ICAO calls a State Safety Program (SSP). An overview of the FAA approach to SMS may be found in the following PDF document.
The Federal Aviation Administration published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the establishment of SMS for air carriers. That NPRM explains that it is intended to serve as the foundation for rules that would later be applied to Part 135 operators, Part 145 repair stations and Part 21 manufacturers. "Id". Several U.S. trade associations filed comments in response to the air carrier NPRM, including the Aviation Suppliers Association (ASA) comments in response to the SMS NPRM. and the Modification and Replacement Parts Association (MARPA) Among these comments were arguments for developing separate SMS regulations for other certificate holders, in order to make sure that SM remains a usable tool for advancing safety (rather than a uniform but useless paperwork exercise). In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration has also filed a NPRM for SMS for airports, which would be separate from the rules for SMS for air carriers (consistent with the arguments of the trade associations).
The European Aviation Safety Administration (EASA) began the process of implementing Safety Management System (SMS) regulations by issuing Terms of Reference (TOR) on July 18, 2011. That was followed by a Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) issued on January 21, 2013. The proposed EASA regulation would apply to repair stations, but would have significant ancillary effects on other aviation industry sub-sectors.
Maritime Industry.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is another organization that has adopted SMS. All international passenger ships and oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas carriers, bulk carriers and cargo ships of 500 gross tons or more are required to have a Safety Management System. In the preamble to the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, the IMO states, “The cornerstone of good safety management is commitment from the top. In matters of safety and pollution prevention it is the commitment, competence, attitudes and motivation of individuals at all levels that determines the end result.”
Railway Industry.
Transport Canada’s Rail Safety Directorate incorporated SMS into the rail industry in 2001. The Rail Safety Management System requirements are set out in the "Railway Safety Management System Regulations". The objectives of the Rail Safety Management System Regulations are to ensure that safety is given management time and corporate resources and that it is subject to performance measurement and monitoring on par with corporate financial and production goals.
The effect of SMS in the rail industry has not been positive, as a 2006 Toronto Star review of Transportation Safety Board data indicated that rail accidents were soaring. Critics have argued that this evidence should preclude the adoption of SMS in the aviation sector. However, Transportation Safety Board data show that the accident rate in the rail industry has actually varied around the average over that 10-year period. Since the Toronto Star article was published, the accident rate has decreased. The Transportation Safety Board reported that “a total of 1,143 rail accidents were reported to the TSB in 2008, a 14% decrease from the 2007 total of 1,323 and an 18% decrease from the 2003–2007 average of 1,387” and also noted that, in 2008, rail incidents reported under the TSB mandatory reporting requirements reached a 26 year low of 215.

Frederick Miller (cricketer)

Frederick Peel Miller (born 29 July, 1828 at Clapham, London; died 22 November, 1875 at Chilworthy House, Ilminster, Somerset) was an English cricketer. He played in first-class matches from 1851 to 1868, primarily for Surrey, for whom he appeared from 1851 to 1867, captaining them from 1851 to 1857. He was a very successful captain, Surrey being acclaimed as the Champion County in 1851, 1854, 1856 and 1857. In 1857 the county won all nine of its matches. During the remainder of Miller's career Surrey was recognised as the leading county in 1858, 1859 and 1864.
His brother, WH Miller, also played first-class cricket,
As player.
He was a right-handed batsman who, in 137 first-class matches, made 3117 runs at an average of 14.59 - respectable enough for the period, when pitches were very poor by modern standards. (For comparison, George Parr averaged 20.20.) He made two centuries, with a highest score of 133. He was also a useful bowler, with 256 wickets at 20.58, with best innings figures of 6/36.
He appeared for the Gentlemen in their prestigious fixture against the Players on twelve occasions between 1855 and 1863.
As captain.
The writer David Lemmon is very complimentary about Miller's captaincy, bracketing him with John Shuter, Percy Fender and Stuart Surridge. He imposed a firm discipline on his side, but "never asked anyone to do what he would not do himself". He was a fine tactician; Jem Grundy of Nottinghamshire said that his captaincy was worth fifty runs in the field, a very large number in view of the low scores of the period.

Gasconadian Stage

The Gasconadian Stage is the first stage of the Ordovician geologic period in North America and of the Lower Ordovician Canadian Epoch, coming immediately after the Late Cambrian Trempealeauan and preceding the middle Canadian Demingian Stage. The Gasconadian is equivalent to the European Tremadocian and roughly to the Skullrockian of the Ibexian series. 
The Gasconadian is named for the Gasconade Formation of Missouri, named in turn for the Gasconade River, and is represented by the Tribes Hill Formation in New York state and by the upper Bliss Fm and the Sierrite Ls of the El Paso Group in southern New Mexico and west Texas. 
The Gasconadian is a common term in the paleontological and stratigraphic literature of the previous century, whether used simply for a span of time or for strata laid down during that time.
Time and duration.
Recent estimates (ICS and Cosuna) place the beginning of Gasconadian, and Ordovician, anywhere from about 488 to 500 million years ago, with a duration ranging from 9.7 to 10 million years respectively putting the end about 464 m.y.a. Both give estimates of over half the Early Ordovician. 60 percent according the ICS, 2/3 according to Cosuna.
Strata.
The Gasconadian (Tremadocian) is represented in southern New Mexico and west Texas by the upper part of the Bliss Formation and the Sierrite Limestone which is the lowermost formation of the Lower Ordovician (Canadian) El Paso Group. The Bliss is a near shore, deltaic, and beach sandstone deposit; the lower part spans the Upper Cambrian. The Sierrite Limestone is a shallow water, carbonate shelf deposit. The contact between the two is gradational. 
Generalized stratigraphic sections from the region indicate Gasconadian age strata take between 20 and 40 percent the Lower Ordovician section; 20 percent in Franklin Mtns outside of El Paso, Texas; 40 percent in the Caballo Mtns further north in southern New Mexico. This suggests the Gasconadian may actually take up well less than half the Early Ordovician rather than the principal amount.
Cephalopods.
Cephalopods from the Gasconadian belong exclusively to the nautiloid order Ellesmerocerida, and predominantly to the Ellesmeroceratidae.
Among these were "Clarkoceras" and "Ectenolites"which continued from the Late Cambrian, along with the exclusively Ordovician "Ellesmeroceras" the similar "Eremoceras", both cylindrically orthoconic, and the compressed endogastirc "Dakeoceras". All have essentially straight, short septal necks and thick concave connecting rings in the siphuncle. 
The latter Canadian, following the Gasconadian saw the onset and early diversification of two new orders, the Endocerida and Tarphycerida, evolution of new families within the Ellerocerida (e.g. Baltoceratidae and Bathmoceratidae), and near the end the first of the Orthocerida, Actinocerida, and Discosorida. 
The limited suprageneric cephalopod diversity of the Gasconadian compared to the ordinal diversity that followed also suggests a relatively short duration for the stage.

Cornelia Phillips Spencer

Cornelia Phillips Spencer (March 20, 1825 - March 11, 1908) was a North Carolina, United States, poet, social historian, and journalist who was instrumental in reopening the University of North Carolina after a five-year shutdown during Reconstruction.
Biography.
Cornelia Phillips was born March 20, 1825 in Harlem, New York City, New York, the youngest of three children born to James Phillips and Judith Vermeule Phillips. (Her brother Samuel F. Phillips served as United States solicitor general under President Ulysses S. Grant.) In 1826, James Phillips took a post as a mathematics professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
She married James Monroe Spencer in 1855 and moved to Alabama, where their only child, Julia (later known as June Spencer Love), was born in 1859. Spencer and her daughter returned to Chapel Hill after her husband's death in 1861, where she began her first book and wrote about the university for local newspapers. She published regular columns in "The North Carolina Presbyterian" and the "Raleigh Sentinel".
She urged the North Carolina legislature to close the university in 1870 to protect the school from Reconstruction politics, later revealed to be her own disagreement with the politics of university leaders at the time.
After Reconstruction, she similarly urged on the school's reopening and, on March 20, 1875, Spencer climbed to the roof of the South Building and rung its bell to celebrate. She contributed to the university by writing hymns for special occasions, organizing community events, and keeping the alumni records. In 1895, she became the first woman to receive an honorary degree from the University.
Death and afterward.
Cornelia Phillips Spencer died at her home in on March 11, 1908. She was interred in Old Chapel Hill Cemetery. Her collected papers are in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The university's Spencer Residence Hall is also named for her.
As part of the university's bicentennial activities, the Cornelia Phillips Spencer Bell Award was established. The award, given to a woman who has made outstanding contributions to the university, was awarded annually from 1994 until 2004, when it was retired following the discovery that Spencer espoused racist views, based on letters found in university archives, including opposing the admission of African American students. The University Awards for the Advancement of Women were created following the Bell Awards' retirement.

Public Libraries (journal)

Public Libraries is the official journal of the Public Library Association, a division of the American Library Association. It is devoted exclusively to public libraries, and is published six times a year.
Early history.
"Public Libraries"' first issue came out in May 1896. According to its Prospectus, Public Libraries came about as a response to "many letters of inquiry...which the larger libraries receive from the smaller ones in every part of the country" about the "small details and elementary principles of work." 
"["Public Libraries"] will deal with all phases of library work in a concise, simple way, such as will give the best aid to those who need it." To that end, the Prospectus outlined what the magazine set out to cover in 1896--"a large variety of items of news, such as will encourage and inspire small libraries as well as large, to put forth their best effort to accomplish something of value to the library world." The first issue contains the outline of a future ALA publication, the "ALA Library Primer" which concerns itself with both practical and philosophical concerns about establishing a library, such as suggestions for selecting books ("Every library building should be planned specially for the kind of work to be done, and the community to be served" and the qualities that should be looked for when hiring a librarian ("The librarian should have culture, scholarship, and executive ability.") 
Current focus.
Today, "Public Libraries"' website proclaims that "each issue includes important industry news, PLA and ALA updates, and columns and feature articles that offer strategies and ideas that can make a difference in your career."
The following is a list of recurring columns that appear in the journal at the present moment:

Roman Catholic Diocese of Vellore

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Vellore () is a diocese located in the city of Vellore in the Ecclesiastical province of Madras and Mylapore in India.
History.
The Diocese of Vellore was started by Salesians in 1952 carving out a portion from the Archdiocese of Madras-Mylapore. Further in 1969, few parishes from the Archdiocese of Pondicherry-Cuddalore were attached to this Diocese. It comprises two civil districts namely Vellore and Tiruvannamalai. There are 84 parishes having Catholic population of 1, 50,000.
Origin as a Jesuit mission.
The Catholic Mission in North Arcot dates back to 1604. The following chronicles gathered from various sources will give some historical knowledge of this Mission, its foundation and development in the course of over 350 years. The last great prince of the declining Vijayanagar empire (now in Andhra Pradesh), Venkatapathy Deva Rayalu, conquered the kingdom of Vellore in January 1604 and named it Raya Elluru. Elapuri or Elluru in Telugu language would mean city or town. Raya Elluru was meant a town conquered by the king Rayalu and thus the town was named after him – combination of two words Raya and Elapuri.
There were then some Jesuit Fathers at the court of King Rayalu at Chandragiri. He took them also to his new court at Vellore. The word Vellore derives from the Tamil word 'Vel' which means 'spear'; according to another conjecture there were idols of Tamil God 'Murugan' holding 'Vel' in and around Vellore. Vellore was formerly called Velappadi (a place thickly surrounded by a particular tree called 'Velamaram') and for this reason and background the name Vellore came into existence. The Jesuits who had come with their followers here allowed by the King to build again and it is now with the Anglican Church). Ancient Jesuit documents show that among these Jesuits, there was one named Fr. Antonious Rubunus, a preacher and confessor, who was commuting between Chandragiri and Vellore. He was sent to Japan on 12 August 1642. On 22 March 1643 he was martyred at Nagasaki. In 1610, there was a general upheaval against the Jesuits.
The Jesuit residences at Chandragiri and at Vellore were suppressed by a Royal order of the king Philip III of Spain and Portugal in 1611.
Formal Christian faith came to the diocese of Vellore towards the last quarter of the 17th century from the Madurai Mission. Fr. Andrew Preyre, S.J. seems to have been the first to evangelise Vellore. St. John de Britto and his disciple Fr. Francis Laynis visited Vellore in 1680 and 1683. Fr. Francis Laynis, (later Bishop of Mylapore), founded in 1683 and 1691 the mission of Koratampet, the first one in the present diocese of Vellore – in the Taluk of Chengam, North Arcot district, some 80 km South-West of Vellore. In 1699 the first French Jesuit Missionaries settled down at Pondicherry, after closing the Mission of Siam. In 1700 a certain Fr. Mandayat began the Jesuit Carnatic Mission at Puliyur, South of Uthiramerur, Chinglepet district like an Indian Sanyasi just as the Fathers of the Madurai Mission did in those days.
Vellore was surrounded by the Mughuls and was taken over by them in the following year. In 1702, Fr. Mandayat founded the mission of Thakkolam (Arakonam Taluk), which was later placed under the care of Fr. Varance Bouchet. In 1703, he was subjected to persecution and was arrested. Later, he was released by the Governor of the Province, Sek Sahib, at the intervention of Fr. Pierre Martin. During the short time he spent at Vellore he decided to erect a chapel and residence under the patronage of Mary. Later, he and his catechist were thrown out of the city after being severely beaten. It was obvious that the Moghuls did not welcome the idea of Christianity getting established at Vellore.
In 1712, Fr. De La Fontain, Superior of the Carnatic Mission intervened to bring to an end the persecution carried out by the Prince Dewan Hall. He approached the Nawab of Arcot through a Catholic Medical officer of the Nawab of Vellore. The Nawab of Arcot gave Freedom. In 1736, Fr. Jacques de Saignes had two churches built at Vellore and at Arcot. He stayed for a month in these places. He was provided with meals from the Rayal palace.
In 1740, when the Maharaja moved from Vellore to Gingee, Fr. Joseph Trumbley was in charge of Athipakkam (South Arcot) and Koratampet (North Arcot). He wrote that one of his churches was plundered, another burnt down. The church at the Fort of Vellore was destroyed. 21 villages in which most parishioners lived were sacked. Many Catholics were murdered, and others had to leave.
In 1748 the Nawab of Vellore granted one and a half acres of dry land to the priest, along the road, and another piece of land near the hill at Vellore. Two similar grants were made also to the priest at Arcot. In those days the Nawabs were dealing with the donation of lands to priests because the Zamindars were not willing to do this. In 1774, when Punganur (Andhra Pradesh) was occupied by Hyder Ali, a group of Telugu Catholics were brought by Fr. Henri Arnoult to Christianpet (North Arcot). Two families of Rajas from Rajampet in Cuddappah were baptised and then, taken into the service of the Nawab of Vellore. Their descendants are now at Christianpet 10 km North Arcot of Vellore.
Missionaries of the Foreign Missions Society, Paris.
In 1777, the Fathers of the Paris Foreign Missions who were at Pondicherry were given charge of the former Jesuit South Indian Mission under the general name of Malabar Mission, which was also called formerly Carnatic Mission and formerly Pondicherry Mission. The Mission among Tamils was known as the Mission in the Province of Arcot. It fared rather badly.
In 1784, the persecution of Tippu Sultan dispersed several Catholic communities from the ancient Carnatic Mission in Rayalaseema. Some groups went to Vellore under the protection of the British. The Mudali Catholics of Pudur moved of Koratampet and Telugu Reddies and Kavarais settled at Kaniyambady, 12 km South of Vellore.
In 1801, there were about 2,000 Catholics in the region of Vellore. In 1806, Fr. Arnoult died. Fr. Manenty died on 25 May 1812. Fr. Jean Austruay of the Paris Foreign Missions took charge of the Catholics of Vellore region. In 1817, a church was begun at Kortampet. In 1834, Msgr. Bonnand, as co-adjuster to the Prefect Apostolic of Pondicherry, came to Vellore for his first pastoral visitation. A church was built there at the foot of the western hills.
Creation of Vicariates Apostolic.
When the Vicariates Apostolic were created in 1832, Vellore and Southern part of North district formed part of the Vicariate Apostolic of Pondicherry under the Paris Foreign Missions. The North and North Eastern parts of the district, beyond the Trunk Road of Madras – Bangalore, namely the three taluks of Arakonam, Walajapet and Gudiyattam came to form part of the Vicariate Apostolic of Madras and it was entrusted to Mill Hill Fathers.
In 1841, the church at Koratampet was completed. It measured 60 ft. by 15 ft. In 1846 the mission of Vellore had 3,341 Catholics, mostly from the depressed outcaste people. They were served by a priest, four catechists, one school, a main church and eight chapels.
Arcot contonment had 484 Catholics, of whom were in the light cavalry; Kaveripakkam had three or four Catholic families; Alapakkam about 100 Catholics and Christianpet 13 families. As the old church at Vellore was too small and in a miserable condition, the site of a local tank bed was bought for Rs. 200/- in 1847, and the foundation was laid for a new big church. In 1850, Fr. Moncourrier of the Paris Foreign Missions build a church and presbytery at Adakambarai on a site given by two Catholics.
On 9 February 1854, the new church at Vellore was solemnly blessed by Msgr. Bonnand. After 100 years this church was found in a very bad condition and needed much repair. With a sum of one lakh of rupees it was repaired, extended and remodelled. It served as the Cathedral church of the diocese of Vellore from 1952. Again, this church was further extended with two wings with new concrete slab structure and was consecrated on 3 January 1988 by Cardinal Simon Lourdusamy, the Prefect of the Congregation for Oriental Churches when Fr. A. Nambikairaj was the Parish Priest.
In 1884, the Catholic population numbered 3,376 at Vellore; 1429 at Kortampet; 2,473 at Polur; 2,546 at Koviloor and 15,751 at Chettupattu and Arni. Archbishop Joseph Morel of Pondicherry (1909–29) and Archbishop Mederlet (1928–34) of Madras were those who played a great role in the formation of the diocese of Vellore in the initial stage.
Pondicherry missionary Fr. Francis Darras, also called the Apostle of North Arcot, welcomed into the Church 30,000 persons and founded several parishes in North Arcot district during 1876–1916. He built the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes at Chethupattu in 1896 and a chapel on the hill near by in 1880. It is now the Shrine of Our Blessed Lady and the biggest center of pilgrimage in the diocese of Vellore.
Arrival of Salesians of Don Bosco.
In April 1928, the mission of North Arcot with nine parishes, which were under the French Fathers, was consigned by the Holy See to the Salesians of Don Bosco. After three months, Fr. Eugene Mederlet, the first Salesian parish priest of Vellore, was made Archbishop of Madras to succeed Bishop Aelen John (1911–1928). The Archbishop of Madras was entrusted to the Salesians of Don Bosco, and the Salesian mission of North Arcot and the three taluks of Palmaner, Tiruthanni and Chittoor in the civil district of Chittoor were added to the territory of the Archdiocese to Madras.
After the death of the Archbishop Mederlet on 12 December 1934, Bishop Louis Mathias was transferred from the See of Shillong to the Archdiocese of Madras, and he took charge of it on 20 July 1935 and governed it till 1965. One of his outstanding achievements was the formation of the dioceses of Vellore and Thanjavur in 1952.
Favourable factors for Christianity in North Arcot.
The Portuguese had control over coastal areas of Tamil Nadu and Santhome (Mylapore) in the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries. Whenever the Portuguese exercised any authority or influence they supported the spread of Catholicism. The interior of Tamil Nadu was influenced by Mughal ruler Akbar with his friendly attitude to all religions, and similarly by Tirumala Nayak and Queen Mangammal of Madurai and the Kathirava Narasmiah Raj Udayar of Mysore. They all allowed the Christian priests to preach freely in their territories and convert the people to Christianity. The last great prince Venkatapathy Deva Rayalu of Vijayanagar conquered the kingdom of Vellore in 1604 and as we mentioned earlier, he kept two Jesuit priests in his court, first at Chandragiri and later at Vellore, and allowed them to build a church at Vellore fort.
The first Portuguese Jesuits were called back by king Philip III due to their scandalous life, and this hindered evangelisation. Fr. Rubino wrote to the Jesuit general "The missionaries must adapt themselves to Indian customs".
The Renaissance period created a spirit of conquest among the Europeans. The period of Reformation helped to reduce corruption in the Church structures – the clergy, religious and similar organisations.
St Antony’s Shrine – Viruduvilanginan.
Viruduvilanginan was a sub-station of Athipakkam Parish, Pondicherry Archdiocese. Seven years before Fr. Anthony Thumma, the parish priest of Athipakkam, wanted to make it a separate parish. At that time, in November 1969, when the portions of North Arcot in Tiruvannamalai and Chengam Districts were detached from Pondicherry Archdiocese and attached to Vellore Diocese, Viruduvilenginan was one of those sub-stations with a good number of Catholic families, which became part of the Diocese of Vellore.
S. Lazar, the Vicar Capitular of the Diocese erected this village as a parish and appointed Rev.Fr. A. Nambikairaj as its first priest on 16 February 1970. There are 3 sub-stations, namely, Porrikal, Kadagaman and Valavetty. Fr. A. Nambikairaj started to put up a shrine of St Antony on 16 December 1970. The large granite shrine, built of was blessed on 13 June 1976, the feast of St. Antony. The shrine is still visited by many.
St Lordhu's Shrine, Chetpet.
The Mission of Chethupattu, under missionary priest Jean Francois Darras, dates back to 1876. He was born of Mr. Francois Joseph and Marie Josephine Dowey on 16 March 1835. He was ordained on 18 June 1859 along with eight companions. He came to Pondicherry as a missionary; from there he came to the diocese of Vellore. Chethupattu was made a separate Parish on 11 March 1878.
Fr. Darras had taken a vow to build a shrine in honour of Our Lady of Lourdes and built it on a hill top about 2 ½ miles away from Chethupattu. Since this Church was too small, Fr. Darras built a larger one and dedicated it to Our Lady of Lourdes. It was blessed on 1 May 1896, by Rev. Gandi. The feast of Our Lady of Lourdes is celebrated there on the first week of March every year.
In 1948 the parish priest, later Bishop of North Arcot, S. David Marianayagam, built the present Hill Chapel to replace the old one. Chethupattu has a population of 4,000 Catholics with 21 mission stations. It has a High Secondary School for boys and one for girls, and five Elementary Schools. Sisters of St. Anne’s Madavaram manage the Higher Secondary School for Girls. There are more than 2,000 pupils. The parish also contains the St. Thomas Hospital and Leprosy Centre.
Missionaries include Frs. A. Fernandes, F. Capiaghi, M. Arockiasamy, F. Schlooz, Maria Arul, Peter Mathew, S. Susai and Fr. Thomas George. The Centenary of the shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes was celebrated in March 1978.
Fr. Kuriakos on 26 January 2002 started Marivalam in the hill chapel of Chetpet.
Cathedral.
History of the cathedral.
The Society of Jesus spread Christianity in Vellore from 1604. In 1854 Vellore was made a parish. In the same year Assumption church was built. It was under the Madras Archdiocese and looked after by the Mill-Hill Fathers. In 1928, the North Arcot mission was entrusted to the care of Salesians of Don Bosco. On 13 November 1952, Catholic Diocese of Vellore was bifurcated from Arch Diocese Madras-Mylapore and Assumption church was announced as the cathedral of the new born Diocese of Vellore. In 1955, David Maria Nayagam, Bishop of Vellore Diocese, repaired the Assumption Cathedral and consecrated it. During the time of Michael Augustin, Rev. Msgr. A. Nambikairaj built the right and left wings of the cathedral. Even with these extensions, the cathedral had space only for 300 to 500 people.
The new cathedral.
Assumption cathedral was demolished and basement for the new cathedral was blessed in 1999, 24 May. The new and one of the biggest Cathedrals in Asia was consecrated on 15 September 2002 by Simon D. Lourdusamy and opened by Bernard Prince. Blessed Sacrament chapel, prayer meeting hall, Glass paintings of 18 important events of salvific history and 15 mysteries of Rosary, and 165 feet height Belfry are special features of the new cathedral. The present cathedral has capacity for 3,000 to 5,000 people.

Educated at the school of the Paris Opera Ballet, he joined the company in 1801 after an initial engagement with Jean Dauberval in Bordeaux. The Paris Opera's "maître de ballet" Pierre Gardel presented an obstacle which led Aumer to choose the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin as the venue for which to create his early ballets. Faced the with implacable competition from Gardel, Aumer left France for engagements in Kassel (1808-1814) and Vienna (1814-1820). Brief periods in Paris (1821-1822) and London (1824-1825) were followed by his return to the Paris Opera Ballet (1820-1831), where, enriched by the experience of working abroad, he engaged in a profound renovation of the French repertory, capped by his "chef-d'œuvre", "Manon Lescaut" (1830). His daughter Sophie-Julie married the danseur Étienne Leblond in 1826.

1887–88 Newton Heath LYR F.C. season

The 1887–88 season was Newton Heath LYR's final season before entering into league football. They only entered one competitive cup competition during the season, the Manchester and District Challenge Cup. They won the tournament, beating Denton 7–1 in the final at Whalley Range.
Manchester and District Challenge Cup.
Newton Heath LYR entered the Manchester and District Challenge Cup for the fourth time in 1887–88. Having reached the final in each of their three previous entries, they made it a fourth consecutive final appearance this season. They started their campaign in the Second Round away to Hooley Hill in March 1888, beating them 7–0. The semi-final against Hurst was played on neutral ground in Denton. It was a tougher match than the previous round, as proven by the 2–0 scoreline, with the Doughty brothers, Jack and Roger, getting a goal apiece.
As with the previous three seasons, the final was played at Whalley Range in south Manchester. Newton Heath's opponents in the final were Denton, who proved to be no contest, as Newton Heath won the match 7–1 to make it two Manchester Cup titles in four years. Both Doughtys scored in the final, as they both had done in the two previous rounds, with Jack getting a hat-trick and Roger a brace. The other two goals were scored by Joe Davies and Tom Burke.

Beekmanoceras

Beekmanoceras is a small cephalopod from the Middle Canadian of New York with a gyroconic (i.e. comparatively loosely coiled) shell in which the siphuncle is on the inner or concave side of the whorl. Furnish and Glenister (1964) placed Beekmanoceras in the Trocholitidae (Tarphycerida), interpreting the curvature to be exogastastric and the siphuncle to be dorsal. Flower (1964) included Beekmanoceras in the Ellesmeroceratidae (Ellesmerocerida) believing the siphuncle to be ventral and the curvature to be endogastric.
Structural details of the genotype "Beekmanoceras priscum" the only species known, are obscure, allowing for different interpretations (ibid). A few things can be said however. No other trocholitids are known to have an openly coiled gyroconic shell which casts doubt on that placement. On the other hand no endogastric cyrtocones are known for sure to have developed the kind of gyroconic coiling found in Beekmanoceras.

Oakton–Skokie (CTA station)

Oakton–Skokie is a rapid transit station on the Chicago Transit Authority's Yellow Line, which serves Skokie's downtown. Previously, a station existed at this location which was in operation as part of the CTA's Niles Center Route from 1925 until 1948, and later demolished in 1964. The current station opened on April 30, 2012.
Station layout.
In the 1920s, both the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the North Shore Line (an interurban railroad linking Chicago and Milwaukee) existed under the private ownership of Samuel Insull. The North Shore Line's original route to Milwaukee ran through numerous North Shore communities that had become densely settled. In order to provide faster service between Chicago and Milwaukee, the North Shore Line decided to build a high-speed bypass several miles west of its original line. The new route would traverse the Skokie Valley and converge with the 'L' at Howard. In an attempt to encourage development in the village of Niles Center on the southern portion of the line, the Chicago Rapid Transit Company would operate rapid transit service as far as Dempster Street.
The new "Niles Center Route" included several intermediate stations served only by the Chicago Rapid Transit Company, including one at Oakton Street, just a few blocks from the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and Oakton Street where the business district of Niles Center was forming. Arthur U. Gerber, staff architect for Samuel Insull, designed the station in the Prairie School style, similar to the Dempster station at the end of the line. The station at Oakton was smaller and set between the tracks, with a single high-level island platform projecting from the rear of the station house.
Service.
The line entered operation on March 28, 1925, but did not encourage much development before the Great Depression and World War II put a halt to building activity for nearly 20 years. The Niles Center service remained unprofitable in 1947 when the privately owned Chicago Rapid Transit Company was subsumed into the public Chicago Transit Authority, and on March 27, 1948, rapid transit service was terminated and replaced with the #97 Skokie bus. All rapid transit stations along the line were closed, except for Dempster where North Shore Line service continued until the company went out of business in 1963.
On Monday, April 20, 1964, the Chicago Transit Authority reinstated service on the Niles Center Branch as a nonstop shuttle between Howard and Dempster, dubbed the Skokie Swift. No station was located at Oakton, even though it is only one block from Skokie's central business district.
Reconstruction.
Since the Swift began operating in 1964, there has been interest on the part of the Village of Skokie and its citizens to reestablish at least one of the local stations. The most likely candidate to return was Oakton, due to its location near Skokie's downtown and its potential to generate the most traffic. A study commissioned by the Village of Skokie and completed in Fall 2003 recommended establishing a stop at Oakton. Village officials discussed and planned for a downtown Skokie Swift station for more than five years. More recently, a developer purchased the Pfizer Pharmaceuticals property adjacent to the station site to build a life sciences research park, now Illinois Science + Technology Park. The employees at the research park would drive ridership at the station. The CTA has supported plans for the Oakton station, as indicated in a 2003 letter from then CTA President Frank Kruesi: "By... providing infill stations the Yellow Line, the CTA will make better use of existing service capacity and provide expanded reverse commute opportunities."
Style and design.
In early 2005, the village received $417,000 in a federal grant earmarked for the station's design, which covers about 80 percent of design costs for the station. The village would pick up the remainder, about $104,000, according to Village Director of Engineering Fred Schattner. Then, in mid-2005, village staff submitted a grant proposal to the federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant program, which provides funds for projects that contribute to traffic congestion relief and cleaner air quality. In late November 2005, the Skokie secured a $1 million federal grant for the village's downtown Skokie Swift project with the help of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-9th. Then, in early December 2005, Skokie learned they would receive an additional $9.2 million in federal grant funds to construct the station. The entire project is estimated to cost about $15 million including any land acquisition needed, which means the village had by this time secured more than two-thirds of the funding. Skokie Mayor Van Dusen has said he is exploring options to help pay for some or all of the remaining cost.
Location.
The station is located on the site of the original station, just west of Skokie Boulevard, north of Oakton Street and adjacent to the new Illinois Science + Technology Park. The village sought proposals from firms for design work for the new station, eventually awarding the contract to McDonough Associates. Construction of the new downtown station was expected to begin in 2007 and officials estimated the station would be completed in 2007 or 2008. Issues of financing delayed the project as various funding sources were secured, and later issues of land acquisition delayed the project further. Finally in 2007 after extensive deliberation, the Village of Skokie initiated eminent domain proceedings against two landowners (an auto repair shop and a truck rental business) to make room adjacent to the station for a "kiss and ride" area, a bus turnaround and a taxi drop-off area.
A groundbreaking ceremony took place at the adjacent Illinois Science + Technology Park on June 21, 2010. On June 8, 2011, the Chicago Transit Board revealed that the name of the station would be "Oakton–Skokie". Naming of the station was done concurrently with the renaming of the Dempster-Skokie Yellow Line station and terminus.
Facilities.
The station consists of an island platform at grade level located between the Yellow Line's two tracks; the eastern track serves trains to Dempster-Skokie, while the western track serves trains to Howard. Oakton–Skokie has two entrances: one will located off of Oakton Street, the other off Skokie Boulevard near Searle Parkway.

List of parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons

The list of parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty encompasses the states which have signed and ratified or acceded to the international agreement limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.
On 1 July 1968, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was opened for signature. Russia (a successor of the Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, and the United States are the three depositary states; states wishing to become a party to the NPT must deposit their instruments of ratification, accession or succession at the respective capitals of the depositary states: London, Moscow, and Washington, D.C.. The treaty came into force and closed for signature on 5 March 1970 with the deposit of ratification of the three depositary states and 40 others. Since then, states that did not sign the treaty may only accede to it, which China and France did in 1992.
The treaty recognizes five states as nuclear-weapon states: the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China (also the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council). Four other states are known or believed to possess nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan and North Korea have openly tested and declared that they possess nuclear weapons, while Israel has had a policy of opacity regarding its nuclear weapons program. India, Israel, and Pakistan have never signed the treaty. North Korea was a party to the treaty but announced its withdrawal on 10 January 2003; its withdrawal became effective ninety days later. However, there is disagreement among the parties to the treaty whether North Korea's withdrawal was in conformity with the terms of the treaty. 
As of July 2011, 189 states are recognized as parties to the treaty. Montenegro is the most recent state to have joined, having submitted its instrument of succession on 3 June 2006. In addition, the Republic of China (Taiwan), which is currently only recognized by , ratified the treaty prior to the United Nations General Assembly's vote to transfer China's seat to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1971; Taiwan has accepted comprehensive IAEA safeguards and the measures of the Additional Protocol to verify that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful. Four UN member states have never signed the treaty: India, Israel, Pakistan, and South Sudan. The Cook Islands and Niue, two associated states of New Zealand which have had their "full treaty-making capacity" recognised by United Nations Secretariat, are not parties to the treaty but consider themselves bound by its provisions by virtue of their administration by New Zealand when the latter ratified the NPT.
The NPT remains the most widely subscribed to arms control treaty in history.
Ratified or acceded states.
188 UN member states and observer Holy See are parties to the NPT. 
Multiple dates indicate the different days in which states submitted their signature or deposition, varied by location. This location is noted by: (L) for London, (M) for Moscow, and (W) for Washington D.C.
Bolded states with a dagger () are recognized as nuclear weapons states by the treaty.
Unrecognized state, abiding by treaty.
The Republic of China (Taiwan), which is currently only recognized by , ratified the treaty prior to the United Nations General Assembly's vote to transfer China's seat to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1971. When the PRC subsequently ratified the treaty, they described the Republic of China's (ROC) ratification as "illegal". The ROC has committed itself to continue to adhere to the requirements of the treaty, and the United States has declared that they still consider them to be "bound by its obligations".
Withdrawn state.
Article X allows a state to leave the treaty if "extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country", giving three months' (ninety days') notice. The state is required to give reasons for leaving the NPT in this notice. Article X.1 only requires a state to give three months' notice in total, and does not provide for other states to question a state's interpretation of "supreme interests of its country".
North Korea was a party to the treaty, but in 1993 they gave notice to withdraw from the NPT. However, after 89 days, North Korea reached agreement with the United States to freeze its nuclear program under the Agreed Framework and "suspended" its withdrawal notice. In October 2002, the United States accused North Korea of violating the Agreed Framework by pursuing a secret uranium enrichment program, and suspended shipments of heavy fuel oil under that agreement. In response, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, disabled IAEA equipment, and, on 10 January 2003, announced that it was ending the suspension of its previous NPT withdrawal notification. There is disagreement among the parties to the treaty whether North Korea's withdrawal was in conformity with the terms of the treaty. North Korea said that only one more day's notice was sufficient for withdrawal from the NPT, as it had given 89 days before. The IAEA Board of Governors rejected this interpretation. Most countries held that a new three-months withdrawal notice was required, and some questioned whether North Korea's notification met the "extraordinary events" and "supreme interests" requirements of the Treaty. The Joint Statement of 19 September 2005 at the end of the Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks called for North Korea to "return" to the NPT, implicitly acknowledging that it had withdrawn.
Non-signatory states.
Four UN member states have never signed the treaty. The Cook Islands and Niue, two associated states of New Zealand which have had their "full treaty-making capacity" recognised by United Nations Secretariat, are not parties to the treaty but consider themselves bound by its provisions by virtue of their administration by New Zealand when the latter ratified the NPT.

Online travel auction

An online travel auction is a system of buying and selling travel products and services online by proffering them up for bid and then awarding the item to the highest bidder.
As with a standard (offline) auction, the bidders, having made a judgment on how much a particular product is worth to them, place their bid over a set period of time. At the end of this period of time, the highest bidder ‘wins’ the product at whatever price is finally reached.
Like a number of other travel websites, travel auction sites pull their stock inventory in from a wide variety of suppliers. The range of products may include cruises, package holidays, hotels and flights.
Types of Travel Auction.
As well as the most familiar English auction (or "open ascending price auction") model, where the participant places a bid higher than the last, a handful of operators run no-reserve auctions or "absolute auctions".
Some sites also operate a system of "mystery auctions", whereby the bidder is unaware of the product they are bidding on. Another variation on the theme is proxy bidding which involves the bidder stating their maximum bid for a particular product, and the auction site placing the bids for them automatically.

Los Angeles Sol

The Los Angeles Sol was an American professional soccer club that was based in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, California that participated in Women's Professional Soccer. 
The team was co-owned and operated by Blue Star, LLC and AEG, a subsidiary of the Anschutz Entertainment Group. The Sol had played its home games at The Home Depot Center. It was announced on January 28, 2010 that the team would cease operations.
History.
The formation of Women's Professional Soccer was announced on September 4, 2007, and it was also announced on that day that a franchise had been awarded to Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Sol was officially unveiled on October 26, 2008. USA Women’s National Team midfielder Shannon Boxx was the first player in Sol history when she was allocated to the team on September 16, 2008.
2009 Season.
The team played its first game on March 29, 2009, against Washington Freedom resulting in a 2-0 victory. The first goal in club and league history was recorded in the sixth minute of the match, when defender Allison Falk out-jumped a crowd of Freedom defenders in the penalty area to head in a free kick from Japanese National Football Team star Aya Miyama.
The Sol won their next two games as well, totaling a +5 goal differential, setting them apart early as the best team in the league. Though they didn't win either of their next two games, they never dropped from first place in the table, and then went on an eleven-game unbeaten streak, with three draws and eight wins, at times having twice the amount of points as the second-place team. They then lost to the Saint Louis Athletica in their last home game of the season, which ended their streak and kept alive the hopes that some team other than the Sol could win the regular season title, but a 0-0 draw against FC Gold Pride (who was the worst team in the league) gave the Sol the regular season title with two games to spare. The lost 1-3 to the Chicago Red Stars and won 2-1 against the Boston Breakers to end their regular season, the win giving the Sol the title of the first team to beat every other team in the league. The finished the season with 41 pts. (a 12-3-5 record) and a +17 goal differential.
Being regular season champions, the Sol received a bye to the August 22nd championship match. They lost 0-1 to Sky Blue FC who made the playoffs when potential invitees Boston earned no points in their final regular season match against the Sol.
Sale and folding.
In November, AEG gave their share of the Sol back to WPS. WPS ran the Sol for the next three months, completing trades, changing coaches, and participating in the 2010 WPS Draft. However, the potential ownership group that WPS had been working with to take on the Sol backed out "in the 11th hour" according to league commissioner Tonya Antonuci. Following this failure to sell the team, the league announced its decision to disband the Sol on January 27, 2010, and organized a dispersal draft for the 19 players under contract to be held February 4.

The Equity Project

The Equity Project (TEP) is a New York charter school opened in September 2009. The school will instruct students in fifth through eighth grades and will pay its teachers a starting salary of $125,000 per year, more than double the national average. Teachers must also work double the hours a typical teacher works.
Background.
TEP was created by Zeke Vanderhoek, a Yale graduate and former middle school teacher with Teach For America. Prior to creating TEP, Zeke was the founder of ManhattanGMAT, a test preparation company headquartered in New York City. The New York State Education Department approved a five-year provisional charter for the school, which will expire on January 14, 2013. TEP will open with a single class of 120 fifth grade students, and 7 teachers. Each year, a new class of 120 fifth graders will be added, and 7 new teachers hired to teach the next grade level, until the school reaches full capacity of 480 students and 28 teachers in its fourth year of operation.
Teachers will earn a starting salary of $125,000, while the principal's salary starts at $90,000. In exchange for their higher-than-average salaries, teachers will work longer hours, and take on additional responsibilities. These responsibilities include leading an after-school activity for the school's "Extended-Day Program", and taking on a whole-school position (Disciplinary Dean, for example).
Unlike regular public school teachers, these teachers can be fired at will. To counter the teachers' high salaries, the school will not have any assistant principals, deans, or any other bureaucrats.
The 2011-2012 Progress Report from the NYC Department of Education gives TEP an overall grade of "A", and grades of "A" in every subcategory of the report, as well as extra points for exceptional gains with particularly challenging sub-populations of students. TEP was scored in the top 10% of all middle schools in NYC.
Subjects.
TEP students at all levels take one 55-minute class every day in the following subjects: English Language Arts, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, Latin, and Music. In addition, students take 55 minutes of Physical Education three days a week, and spend one additional hour three days a week in the "Extended-Day Program".
The inclusion of Music and Latin as the only "electives" was decided upon to supplement TEP's focus on Language Development. Extended study of both subjects has been shown to improve students' scores on the SAT. In addition, by only offering these two courses, and making them mandatory across all levels, the students will become strong students in both.
Extended Day Program.
Under TEP's Extended Day Program, students will spend an additional hour, three days a week, taking an extra-curricular activity. Each TEP teacher must develop and lead one of these extra-curricular activity classes. Students rank their preferences of the available activities at the start of the year, and is assigned to one activity each semester.
This time will also serve as a time for students who are struggling to receive additional help. TEP's two Special Education teachers, and the two Reading & Language Specialists will be available to aid struggling students either one-on-one, or in small groups.

Willem Hubert Nolens

Mgr. mr. dr. Wilhelmus Hubertus (Wiel) Nolens (Venlo, September 7, 1860 - The Hague, August 27, 1931) was a Dutch politician and a Roman Catholic priest.
Life.
Willem Hubert Nolens was born to Martin Nolens, a tanner, and Hermina Hubertina Linskens. He studied philosophy at the "Bisschoppelijk College" of Rolduc (1874–1880), theology at Roermond Seminary (1880–1884) and jurisprudence and law at Utrecht University (1887–1890). He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1887 and taught economics and moral philosophy at Rolduc. In 1896 he was elected to the Dutch House of Representatives. He joined the club of Roman Catholic members of parliament of which fellow priest Herman Schaepman was the chairman.
Politics.
In 1904, a year after Schaepman's death, Nolens and other Roman Catholic politicians founded the General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses. He was a democratically-minded politician who strove to better the fate of the working class and favoured better social security. Like Schaepman before him, this brought him into conflict with the conservative Catholics in parliament. In 1910 Nolens became the "fractievoorzitter" of the General League in parliament, a position he would retain until his death in 1931. In 1918 he became "formateur" of a cabinet. Although in Dutch political discourse becoming formateur normally leads to the office of Prime Minister, Nolens could not accept the position because of his clerical status. Instead Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck was named the first Roman Catholic Prime Minister in Dutch history and he chaired the cabinet Nolens had formed. In 1926 the loose organisation of the General League was further tightened and it was renamed to Roman Catholic State Party. When young Catholic intellectuals drifted towards right-wing extremism at the end of the 1920s Nolens faced increasing criticism. In 1930 the National Socialist Catholic poet Gerard Wijdeveld fiercely attacked Nolens in his poem "De Droom van Nolens (Nolens's Dream)" because of his perceived soft stance on freedom of religion in the Dutch East Indies.
Importance.
Nolens was an influential politician in Dutch politics throughout the 1920s and 1930s as the Roman Catholic State Party was the largest party in Dutch parliament at the time. He was immensely popular amongst the miners in his native Limburg for they owed much of their improved working and living conditions to his support for social reforms. The night before his funeral street lighting in Venlo was covered as a sign of mourning. Ten thousand people attended the funeral next day.

1948 San Francisco 49ers season

The 1948 AAFC season 49ers began their third season in the AAFC, hoping to improve upon their 8–4–2 output from the previous season. They began the season 10–0, and finished 12–2, both losses coming to eventual season champions, the Cleveland Browns. 
The 49ers' offense was historically prolific: they scored 495 points in 1948 (averaging over 35 points per game), which was more than 100 points more than the next best output (389 points by the Browns). Despite their 12–2 record, the 49ers did not qualify for the playoffs, due to the Browns 14–0 record.
The 1948 49ers had a record-setting rushing attack: the team rushed for a staggering 3,653 yards in only fourteen games, a professional football record that still stands.
The 49ers of 1948 are one of only three teams in NFL history to score more than 35 points nine times in a single season.

Chesterfield Canal Trust

The Chesterfield Canal Trust Limited is a waterway society and charitable company which campaigns for and undertakes various activities related to the Chesterfield Canal, which runs from Chesterfield in Derbyshire, England to the River Trent at West Stockwith.
History.
The forerunner of the Trust was the Chesterfield Canal Society, founded in September 1976, at a time when the canal was derelict above Worksop. The Society worked with the Retford and Worksop Boat Club and the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association to organise a boat rally to celebrate 200 years of the canal in 1977. The event attracted around 150 boats and 21,000 people, and was the first step towards plans to restore Morse Lock, then the head of navigation.
With progress on the extension of the navigable canal above Worksop being slow, the Society turned its attention to the Chesterfield end of the canal, and completed the restoration of Tapton Lock, which was opened on 29 April 1990 by the Mayor of Chesterfield. Another major step forward occurred in 1995, when Dixon's Lock and Hollingwood Lock were opened, both having been restored by the Society. Dixon's lock was the biggest achievement, as open-cast coal mining had destroyed the original lock completely, but the replacement was surveyed, designed and built by members of the Society.
The Trust was incorporated in 1997, and a year later it took over the assets of the Society. In 2007, a new mobile information display was funded from a grant given to the Trust by the National Grid and AMEC. The money was part of a safe working initiative for workers refurbishing the overhead power lines between Chesterfield and High Marnham power station.
Aims.
The Trust has over 1000 members, and its aims include
Trip boats.
The Trust operates three 12-seat trip boats, one based at Chesterfield, another at Retford and the latest one at Kiveton Park. The boats are crewed by volunteer members of the Trust and are named after influential figures in the building of the canal, namely John Varley (based at Chesterfield), Seth Ellis (after Seth Ellis Stevenson, based at Retford) and Hugh Henshall (Kiveton Park). All the boats run public trips along their respective stretches of the canal and are available for private charter. The Hugh Henshall is a 45ft diesel electric hybrid boat, funded by a grant from Peoples Millions and the Big Lottery Fund. The Hugh Henshall and John Varley boats are both accessible by wheelchair users.
Volunteers.
In a similar way to the Waterway Recovery Group the trust has a volunteer workforce. This workforce meets most Sundays at various locations along the Canal to carry out repairs, or to work on specific projects. 
Between 2008 and 2011 they were working on the head of navigation at Mill Green. This has now been opened up to boat traffic as a direct result of the efforts of the volunteers.

Konstantine Hovhannisyan (; December 19, 1911 – 1984) was an Armenian professor, architect and archaeologist. He was the head of an excavation team that was responsible for the excavations of the ancient Urartian city of Erebuni (situated on Arin Berd, or Blood Fortress, in Yerevan).
Biography.
Hovhannisyan was born in Tbilisi, Georgia in 1911. He graduated from the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute in 1932 and immediately began to work under the Armenian architects Alexander Tamanian and Nicholas G. Buniatyan (from 1933–1934 and 1934–1941, respectively). As an architect, Hovhannisyan designed many of the Soviet-style apartment buildings and community facilities that sprang around the city of Yerevan.
In 1950, he was appointed the director of an excavation team that dug up the ancient Urartian fortress of Erebuni, located to the southeast of modern-day Yerevan. It was Hovhannisyan who had initially identified Arin Berd as the location of Erebuni, based on inscriptions found adjacent to the city. Hovhannisyan used what was left of Erebuni as a basis for reconstructing the fortress and how it would have looked like when it was built in 782 B.C.
Excavations of Erebuni continued for several decades and he remained its director until 1969. Hovhannisyan served as Director of Ancient Monuments in the Armenian SSR from 1952 to 1979. He was also a professor at his "alma mater", teaching at the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute from 1955 to 1971.

Grand Lodge of Indiana

The Grand Lodge of Indiana is one of two state wide organizations that oversee Masonic lodges in the state of Indiana. It was established on January 13, 1818.
Pre-1900.
The first Lodge in Indiana was created by residents of Vincennes, Indiana. They sought a dispensation to create the Lodge from Louisville, Kentucky's Abraham Lodge #8 in 1806. One was granted in 1807, but due to the distance, they were not able to constitute the lodge. After a second dispensation was sought in 1808, a lodge was formed on March 13, 1809 and the officers were initiated. Other lodges in the Indiana Territory founded by the Grand Lodge of Kentucky were Madison (1815), Charlestown (1816), Melchizedek in Salem (1817), Pisgah in Corydon, Lawrenceburg, Rising Sun, and Vevay (1817). On May 9, 1817, the Grand Lodge of Ohio granted a dispensation for Brookville Harmony Lodge in Brookville, Indiana; this lodge would remain under the Grand Lodge of Ohio for two years following the founding of Indiana's Grand Lodge.
After Indiana attained statehood, it qualified for its own Grand Lodge. While attending the annual meeting of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky in September 1817, members of several lodges within the new state agreed to meet in Corydon with representative from all lodges and discuss the viability of forming a Grand Lodge with the State of Indiana. On December 3, 1817, discussion began as to whether a Grand Lodge for Indiana should be formed, 354 days after Indiana gained statehood. Eleven Freemasons from the various lodges in Indiana met in Corydon, and decided to initiate the new Grand Lodge. Amongst these was the first Lieutenant-governor of Indiana, Christopher Harrison. Thus, the Grand Lodge of Indiana was chartered on January 13, 1818, at the presently-named Schofield House, owned by Alexander Lanier, father of James Lanier and a Freemason as well, in Madison, Indiana. Only three Freemasons were at both meetings. The first Grand Master of Indiana was Alexander Buckner of Charlestown, who would later become a United States senator from Missouri.
The Grand Lodge would have its first annual meeting in Charlestown, and would alternate between cities until in 1828 it met in Indianapolis, where it has met ever since.
Indiana would not escape the anti-Masonry hysteria of the 1820s-1840. In 1828 there were 33 lodges in Indiana. In both 1833 and 1835 ten lodges were closed. At one point, between 1835–1837, there were only twelve lodges left in Indiana. Eighteen lodges were started during this, but only five of which lasted. In 1834 there was even talk of abolishing the Grand Lodge. In many of the years between 1828–1842, the Grand Master did not even attend the Grand Lodge meetings. The number of Masons in Indianapolis during this period dropped from 654 to 513. By 1842 the anti-Masonry hysteria had waned, and the various Grand Lodges could again grow.
Post-1900.
In 1916 the Grand Lodge created the Indiana Masonic Home to support elderly Masons, the widows and orphans of Master Masons, and older members of the Order of the Eastern Star. The Home still exists in Franklin, Indiana.
The number of Freemasons in Indianapolis in 1993 was 13,229 amongst its 23 separate lodges.
Freemasons from Indiana include Oliver P. Morton, Lew Wallace, and Gus Grissom.

Jean (song)

"Jean" is the title of a popular song from 1969. It was written by the American poet and composer Rod McKuen who also recorded a version of the song.
The song was the theme to the film adaptation of Muriel Spark's "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie", which starred noted British film actress Maggie Smith. Smith won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of the lead character in the film, Jean Brodie. The song was performed by songwriter McKuen was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Original Song. Although released as a single in the summer of 1969, McKuen's version of the song failed to reach the American music charts. Sergio Franchi performed the song on the January 3, 1971 broadcast of The Ed Sullivan Show, subsequently released on a rare Franchi DVD.
"Jean" was also recorded by the American singer Oliver. Earlier in 1969, Oliver had reached #3 on the "Billboard" pop and easy listening charts with his version of "Good Morning Starshine," a song from the musical "Hair". While working on an album with producer Bob Crewe (which would also be called "Good Morning Starshine"), "Jean" was selected as a song for the record and subsequently chosen as the follow-up single. It became another hit for the singer, reaching #2 on the pop chart and spending four weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart. Oliver would later describe his cover version of the song: "We had no idea it would be a single. It was a 3/4 ballad in the psychedelic era...it was a beautiful arrangement."

Mookie Tenembaum

Mookie Tenembaum (born 1955) is an Argentinian conceptual multidiciplinary artist. He is also a lawyer and an inventor.
Tenembaum's work reflects his views on the State, freedom, and ecology. For instance, he placed a ton of ice in the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires and named it Placebo. He also caused controversy by publicly projecting on the chest and backs of six half naked ballerinas two video spots one a popular Coca Cola TV ad in which a Polar Bear played with a baby seal and shared a Coke with it while in the opposite one a Polar Bear hunts and blodily devours a baby seal, he named the piece Bearshit.
Biography.
He attended Law School at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and specialized in Anthropology at Temple University of Philadelphia. As a lawyer, he was also district attorney of the city of Jerusalem. During the 90s he decided that some of his ideas could only be created and developed through art, specially art related to new technologies. Therefore, during the past years, Mookie has concentrated specifically on reflecting on the different problems related to the State by means of creating new-media works, . Currently, Mookie is working on pieces having to do with the different social and ideological problems of the state, developing projects such as "Genesis", which by means of an on-line system which generates "trusts" with the status of juridical persons, it reveals how the State presents "traps" in their formulation and efficiency, which are not easily readable for most citizens. With this type of projects, Mookie makes them visible, strongly criticizing the State apparatus ruling Latin America. Chasing utopian goals, with his projects Mookie proposes social reinvention and, as a consequence, refoundation. His compasses in this goal are George Orwell, J.J. Rousseau, and John Locke's theories, as well as Minarchist ideas. An expert on the Internet and new technologies, Mookie is a member of FiRE (Future in Review) an annual event that gathers one hundred people from all over the world to discuss the likely penetration of the latest technological innovations and their impact on a not so far away future. He also founded United Virtualities, a company of on-line systems, and created over twenty on-line technologies, such as Ooqa Ooqa (Explorer's enhanced native toolbar), Schvitzer (an intelligent text highlighter), and Yachne (a 3D animated messenger).
His art piece "Paranoia" was awarded the highest prize in 2008 official National Salon of Visual Arts, the most prestigious award in Argentina.

Glassy Mountain is a mountain close to Pickens, South Carolina, USA, in Northwestern South Carolina, with a summit elevation of 1647 feet (502 m) above mean sea level. While it is an isolated monadnock, it is still close to the Blue Ridge, providing views of nearby summits such as Table Rock and Caesar's Head as well as Greenville. The mountain gets its name from a large, bare, granite face on its North side. At the top of this rock face are small springs that trickle down the mountain, giving it a "glassy" appearance in the sun. It is easily accessible, as a small service road for transmitter towers leads to the summit. Local high-schoolers often paint the rock face with graduation years. These year numbers can be so large as to be seen on aerial imaging of the mountain
This mountain is often confused with another Glassy Mountain located in Greenville County, SC, which is nearby. Glassy Mountain in Greenville County has a higher elevation of 2782 feet and is not a monadnock as it is connected to other mountains. It is also home to the Cliffs at Glassy Mountain golf course community.

Anne Aghion (born 1960) is a French-American documentary filmmaker. She is a Guggenheim Fellow, a Mac Dowell Colony Fellow and a Rockefeller foundation's Bellagio Center Fellow.
In 2005, she won an Emmy Award for her documentary "In Rwanda We Say…The Family That Does Not Speak Dies". In 2009, her film "My Neighbor My Killer" was Official Selection of the Cannes Film Festival and a nominee for Best Documentary at the Gotham Awards.
Filmmaking career.
Aghion is best known for her documentary films on post-genocide Rwanda. Her feature film "My Neighbor My Killer", an official selection at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009, poses the question of "How do you make it right again?" after the end of the genocide. This film as well as the three installments of the Gacaca trilogy are the result of nearly ten years of footage gathered in a small rural community in Rwanda.
In Aghion's first Rwanda film "Gacaca, Living Together Again In Rwanda?", the first installment of the Gacaca series, Anne Aghion closely examines the Gacaca courts, a citizen-based justice system that aims to try the crimes of the genocide. The proceedings would occur on grass - "Gacaca" in Kinyarwanda - where anyone who had a denouncement against the accused would be free to speak. If no one accused a prisoner, then that prisoner would be freed.
"In Rwanda We Say…The Family That Does Not Speak Dies", the second film of the trilogy, chronicles the release of a suspect in his community and how victims and suspects slowly learn how to live together. .
The third installment of her Rwanda series "The Notebooks of Memory" was released in 2009 and gives an account of the beginning of the Gacaca trials. It focuses on the local citizen-judges' examination of testimonies from both the survivors and those accused of the crimes.
The Gacaca films have won numerous awards and gained international fame. They have also been widely used by non-profit organizations for educational and training purposes, and have been screened to officials, victims and prisoners in Rwanda.
On a grant of the National Science Foundation Antarctic artist and writer program, Aghion peregrinated to Antarctica, where she filmed the feature-length, "Ice People". In "Ice People", she filmed the lives of geologists and North Dakota State University professors Allan Ashworth and Adam Lewis and the McMurdo Station staff over four months. The scientists, accompanied by two undergraduate students, researched fossils of ancient specimens as they sought to uncover the climatic evolution of the world's coldest continent. The film premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival in April 2008 and was shown at the Independence Night Film of the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 2008.
Her first film, "", was shot in the skid row of Managua. The film gives viewers an inside look in the life of Nicaraguan slum dwellers as they recount the numerous obstacles they have had to overcome in their lives.
Biography and early career.
Anne Aghion splits her time between residences in New York City and Paris.
Before becoming a filmmaker, Aghion held various posts at "The New York Times" Paris bureau and the "International Herald Tribune". Prior to her debut as director and producer of her own films, she worked as a videographer, as well as production and post-production manager.
Aghion earned a Bachelor of Arts "Magna Cum Laude" in Arab Language and Literature from Barnard College at Columbia University in New York, and following her studies, lived in Cairo, Egypt for two years.

The Via Postumia (which here became the "decumanus maximus") passed through the gate, which was the city's main entrance and was therefore richly decorated. It also originally had an inner court, now disappeared.
The gate's Roman name was Porta Iovia, as it was located near a small temple dedicated to "Jupiter lustralis". In the Middle Ages it was called "Porta di San Zeno", while the current name derives from the guard soldiers which were paid the dazio (Latin "bursarii").
The façade, in local white limestone, has two arches flanked by semi-columns with Corinthian capitals which supports entablature and pediment. In the upper part is a two-floor wall with twelve arched windows, some of which are included in small niches with triangular pediment.

He was educated at Kakamega School.
His election as an MP in the Kenyan parliamentary election, 2007 was nullified in February 2011.
Dr Boni Khalwale won back his Ikolomani seat on the 23rd May 2011, beating off a strong challenge from the Orange Democratic Movement, the dominant party in the region.
Voters in Ikolomani handed New Ford Kenya’s Dr Khalwale 13,208 votes, followed closely by Mr Bernard Shinali of ODM with 10,702.
Ford People’s Collins Matemba came a distant third with 293 votes.
A total of 24, 592 voters out of the registered 35,833 voted in the 63 polling stations in a by-election were seen as a fight between ODM and New Ford-K.
The victory for the man, popularly referred to as the bull-fighter, over Mr Shinali, whom he defeated with a slim margin of 200 votes in the 2007 elections, must came in the wake of high-profile campaigns mounted by the then ODM leadership led by deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi.
The defeat was seen as a blow not only to Mr Mudavadi but also ODM which was restamping its authority in the region where it has more MPs than any other, and as a boost to the presidential ambitions of Saboti MP Eugene Wamalwa who along with Housing minister Soita Shitanda for the New Ford-K candidate.

Ureteral neoplasm

A ureteral neoplasm is a type of tumor that can be primary, or associated with a metastasis from another site.
Treatment may involve removal of the kidney and ureter, or just the ureter.
Classification of cancers often is oriented around the embryological origin of the tissue. In some contexts, the primary division is at the border of kidney and ureter, and in other contexts, the primary division is between derivatives of the metanephric blastema and those of the ureteric bud. Because of this, neoplasia of the ureters are sometimes grouped with tumors of the renal pelvis.

Porta Leoni

Porta Leoni is an ancient Roman gate in Verona, northern Italy.
The gate was built during the Roman Republic by P. Valerius, Q. Caecilius, Q. Servilius and P. Cornelius, and restructured in imperial times. It was connected to the road which led to Bologna and Aquileia.
The original Roman name is unknown. During the Middle Ages it was called "Porta San Fermo", due to the nearby church, while in the Renaissance it was known as "Arco di Valerio". The current name derives from a Roman tomb decorated with two lions (Italian: "leoni"), now moved near Ponte Navi.
The gate has a square structures, with a double façade and two towers which looked towards the countryside. Now only half of the inner façade, covered with white stone in the imperial age, and the foundings are visible. The original decorations are all lost. The lower part is similar to that of Porta Borsari (also in Verona), while the upper part has an exedra with twisted columns.

Matusz made his major league debut on August 4, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. On his debut Matusz went five innings, allowing six hits, one earned run and striking out five. He earned a win in his effort. On September 14th, the O's decided to shut Matusz down for the remainder of the season, wary of overextending the rookie in his first big league season.

Matusz began the 2012 season in the rotation, but was demoted to the bullpen in August. In the bullpen, Matusz excelled, striking out 19 with a 1.35 ERA in 18 appearances. He also did not allow a single inherited runner to score. He pitched the last three months of the season with a rectus abdominis tear, preventing him from sprinting, but not pitching. He had surgery in October to repair the tear, and was expected to be back for spring training.

Schreder HP-14

__NOTOC__
The HP-14 is a Richard Schreder-designed all-metal glider aircraft that was offered as a kit for homebuilding during the 1960s and 1970s. It was originally developed by retrofitting improved wings to the fuselage and tail of the HP-13. Schreder won the 1966 US national soaring championship in the prototype HP-14.
The HP-14 features a folding V-tail and 90-degree flaps for glidepath control. The fuselage and wings are of all-aluminum riveted construction.
Development.
Development of the HP-14 was carried out by several parties but the biggest modifications to the design were carried out by Slingsby Aviation at Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire, England, where a 20-metre wing was fitted on the prototype HP-14C, along with an enlarged V-tail. Later Slingsby production aircraft had a conventional cruciform tail. Slingsby production and sales were hampered by certification problems, particularly with flap actuation at high speed, and the disastrous fire at Kirbymoorside on 18 November 1968. Slingsby produced only three aircraft. Other homebuilders incorporated their own modifications but none achieved production status.

Charles Scribner I

Charles Scribner I (February 21, 1821 - August 26, 1871) was a New Yorker who, with Isaac D. Baker (1819-1850), founded a publishing company that would eventually become Charles Scribner's Sons.
Biography.
Scribner was born in New York City to Uriah Rogers Scribner and Betsey Hawley. After a year's study at New York University, he entered Princeton University and graduated with the class of 1840. He began the study of law, but was obliged by ill health to make a trip to Europe.
After returning from Europe, in 1846 Scribner became the younger partner of Baker in forming a new kind of publishing house under the firm name of Baker and Scribner. Unlike traditional houses, which were generally outgrowths of printing companies or book sellers, theirs would exist purely as a publisher. This had an influence on the character of its publications, which were chiefly confined to the works of contemporary authors. It also published Presbyterian philosophy books. With the death of Baker in 1850, Scribner gained control of the company, renaming it Charles Scribner and then Charles Scribner and Company. With Charles Welford (who died in May 1885), he formed in 1857 the house of Scribner and Welford for the importation of foreign books.
In 1865, Charles Scribner and Co. made its first venture into magazine publishing with "Hours at Home", a monthly magazine. In 1870 this magazine was merged into "Scribner's Monthly" under the editorship of Josiah G. Holland, and published by a separate company, Scribner and Co., with Dr. Holland and Roswell Smith as part owners. On Mr. Scribner's death, the next year, the firm of Charles Scribner and Co. was reorganized as Scribner, Armstrong, and Co., the partners being John Blair Scribner, Andrew C. Armstrong, and Edward Seymour, and in 1877 the publication house was removed to 743 Broadway. Mr. Seymour died 28 April 1877, and in 1878, when Mr. Armstrong retired, the firm-name was changed to Charles Scribner's Sons, under which form the business was conducted after 1879 by Charles Scribner and Arthur H. Scribner, younger brothers of John Blair.
The elder Charles Scribner married Emma Elizabeth Blair (1827-1869) in 1846.
He died of typhoid on August 26, 1871 while traveling in Lucerne, Switzerland.

Robert Plant discography

After the breakup of Led Zeppelin in 1980 (following the death of John Bonham), Robert Plant pursued a successful solo career consisting of nine studio albums, two compilation albums, two video albums, four collaborative albums and forty-two singles. He began his solo career with "Pictures at Eleven" in 1982, followed by 1983's "The Principle of Moments". Popular tracks from this period include "Big Log" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), "In the Mood" (1984), "Little by Little" (from 1985's "Shaken 'n' Stirred"), "Tall Cool One" (a #25 hit off 1988's "Now and Zen") (1990) Manic Nirvana featuring "Hurting Kind (I got my eyes on you)" and "I Believe" (from 1993's "Fate of Nations"), another song written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac. In 1984, Plant formed a short-lived all-star group with Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck called the Honeydrippers, who had a #3 hit with a remake of the Phil Phillips' tune, "Sea of Love" and a follow-up hit with a cover of Roy Brown's "Rockin' at Midnight." Although Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period, his tours in 1983 (with drummer Phil Collins) and 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues.
In 2007, Plant collaborated with bluegrass and country music artist Alison Krauss. They released the critically accepted "Raising Sand" on 23 October 2007, via Krauss' record label, Rounder Records. The album proved to be a success, debuting at #2 on the all-genre "Billboard" 200 and #2 on the Top Country Albums chart. It was an international success as well, being certified Platinum in many countries. In 2008, the album's first single, "Gone, Gone, Gone (Done Moved On)", won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 50th Grammy Awards. At the 51st Grammy Awards, the album won all five categories in which it was nominated – Album of the Year, Best Contemporary Folk Album, Record of the Year (for "Please Read the Letter"), Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (for "Rich Woman") and the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals (for "Killing the Blues").

Chris Kuzneski (born in 1969) is a "New York Times" bestselling American author. His books have been translated into more than 20 languages and have been published in more than 40 countries. His works have also been named a Literary Guild's featured selection and honored by the Florida Book Awards. Due to his success in the United Kingdom, his books are released in the British market several months before they are published in America.
Kuzneski’s novels follow the adventures of Jonathon Payne and David "D.J." Jones, former members of the MANIACs—an elite Special Forces unit in the U.S. military. Although the main characters are ex-soldiers, the novels are not “military” thrillers. Instead, they are often compared to the works of Clive Cussler and James Rollins. Kuzneski’s thrillers are known for their action, adventure, and humor. His novels have garnered the attention of several notable authors. His books have been endorsed by James Patterson, Clive Cussler, Nelson DeMille, Lee Child, Douglas Preston, Vince Flynn, James Rollins, Tess Gerritsen, and Steve Berry.
His fourth thriller, "The Lost Throne", was released in the UK in 2008 and peaked at #5 on the British fiction chart. Putnam released the American hardcover in July 2009. It won the Bronze Medal for Popular Fiction at the Florida Book Awards, which is America’s most comprehensive state book awards program. The American paperback reached the "New York Times" mass-market bestseller list in July 2010.
His fifth thriller, "The Prophecy", was published in the UK in October 2009 and climbed to #4 on the British fiction chart. Putnam released the American hardcover in July 2010.
His sixth novel, "The Secret Crown", was released by Penguin UK on September 30, 2010 and within two weeks rose to #10 on "The Times" bestsellers list. The American version won’t be released until December 2011.
Biographical sketch.
Born in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kuzneski currently lives in Tampa, Florida. In fourth grade, he wrote "The Monster Cookbook", which so impressed the librarian that it was bound and placed in the school library. He played football at the University of Pittsburgh where he received his undergraduate degree in writing and his master's degree in teaching. While studying at Pitt, he wrote for "The Pitt News", the "Indiana Gazette", and the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette". From 1992 until 1998, he taught English and coached football in two western Pennsylvania school districts and was selected to "Who's Who Among America's Teachers". However, he knew he wanted to be an author, so he left teaching and started working on his first novel, "The Plantation".
Recurring characters.
Jonathon Payne, a retired Special Forces officer and former commander of the MANIACs.Payne is CEO of Payne Industries, a hi-tech company. He was introduced in "The Plantation" and has appeared in every Kuzneski novel.

Charter of the Arab League

The Charter of the Arab League (also known as the Pact of the League of Arab States) is the founding treaty of the Arab League. The agreement was concluded in 1945 and endorsed the principle of an Arab homeland while respecting the sovereignty of the individual member states. The internal regulations of the Council of the Arab League and the committees were agreed to in October 1951. Those of the Secretariat-General were agreed to in May 1953.
Since then, governance of the Arab League has been based on the duality of supra-national institutions and the sovereignty of the member states. Preservation of individual statehood derived its strengths from the natural preference of ruling elites to maintain their power and independence in decision making. Moreover, the fear of the richer that the poorer may share their wealth in the name of Arab nationalism, the feuds among Arab rulers, and the influence of external powers that might oppose Arab unity can be seen as obstacles towards a deeper integration of the league.
Initial signatories.
The Charter was concluded on 22 March 1945 by the governments of Syria, Transjordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, and North Yemen. A state joins the Arab League by ratifying the Charter.
Forms of government.
The member states of the Arab League represent all forms of government, including monarchies, both absolute and constitutional, as well as republics.
Autonomous entities.
Officially Iraqi Kurdistan is the only Autonomous Entity in the Arab League, but several countries view Palestine as an Autonomous Entity within Israel, the Palestinian Authority within Israel exercises certain sovereign powers within its borders, but is not a fully independent government. The PA-administrated territories are internationally recognized as occupied by Israel, and not a proper part of that country. The Arab League on the other hand recognizes the State of Palestine as a fully independent State, with Jerusalem as its capital, and Embassies in all of the 20 other Members (Excluding Somalia).

Michael Cavlan

Michael Cavlan (born 1959) is a Minnesota political activist and registered nurse living in Minneapolis. Cavlan is running as an independent candidate for Minnesota's US Senate running against incumbent Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Personal life.
Cavlan was born in San Jose, California, but spent most of his childhood and adolescence in Northern Ireland with his Roman Catholic family. Cavlan lived near Belfast, Northern Ireland from 1969 till 1984. He Became involved in the Irish Trade Union Movement as a member of ITGWU (the Irish Transport and General Workers Union) and IVG&ATA (the Irish Vintners, Grocers & Allied Trades Association). He is married with two sons, and is a nephew of Ballymoney Sinn Féin councillor, Anita Cavlan.
He is a registered nurse working in Minnesota and was a volunteer for the National Disaster Medical System. He specializes for years in burns, trauma and intensive care. In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, he volunteered to assist in caring for wounded survivors. Cavlan called for an official investigation into possible government involvement in the death of Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone, a call which was the subject of an article in the "Star Tribune". Cavlan has also called for independent investigations into the 2001 September 11 attacks and the issues of voter fraud targeting mainly poor people and minorities as well as Diebold, ES&S and Triad electronic vote counting manipulations.
Green Party involvement.
Cavlan's first attempt at electoral politics was a run for the state legislature in 2002 as a Green Party candidate. He almost failed to achieve party endorsement when he refused to disavow support for the use of violence by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Cavlan's run ended almost as soon as it began when he lost the contested Green primary. The contest was the only primary for the Green Party. This was one of the only primary races for the Green Party in Minnesota. His primary opponent was a former Mayor of St Louis Park for the Democratic Party.
Following the disputed Ohio election in 2004, Cavlan went to that state to help with the Green Party's effort to recount Ohio's votes after the 2004 election. Cavlan announced his 2006 candidacy to run for Senate in October 2004 on the Green Party ticket. He faced Republican candidate Mark Kennedy, Independence Party candidate Robert Fitzgerald and the election's winner, Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party candidate Amy Klobuchar, in the general election. Shortly after the election, Cavlan announced his candidacy for the 2008 Senate election. However, at the 2008 Minnesota Green Party convention, he failed to gain the nomination by one vote.
A decades long peace activist, Cavlan has called for immediate troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Among other issues, he is pro-choice, opposes the death penalty, drug prohibition, and school vouchers, and supports gay marriage. During his 2006 Senate campaign he declared:
The Michael Cavlan for US Senate 2012 campaign has just been officially accepted and is now on the ballot for the 2012 Minnesota US Senate race.

William West Neve

William West Neve (7 June 1852 – 26 December 1942) was an English architect in the Arts and Crafts style.
Background.
Born in Cranbrook, Kent, Neve was the youngest of seven siblings and the only son of solicitor William Tanner Neve and his spouse Maria West. 
Neve was educated at Cheltenham College, Gloucestershire and began his architectural training as an assistant in the office of Richard Norman Shaw before leaving in 1877 to practice on his own at No.4 Chilworth Street, London and later from 1878 at No.5 Bloomsbury Square, London. In 1882, Neve worked in partnership with fellow ex-Norman Shaw pupil Ernest Newton. 
Neve is the great-uncle of the British Ambassador Glencairn Balfour Paul and a cousin of the cricketer John Neve.
Notes on built works.
St Martin of Tours Church, Chelsfield.
In 1893, Neve along with assistant Frank Brind, a relative of the client, proposed a design to remodel elements of St Martin of Tours Church, Chelsfield, Kent. This included the construction of a vestry and the installation of a new organ. The original drawings for this scheme are preserved in the library of Canterbury Cathedral.
Kingsbury Manor.
In 1899, Neve designed a large halftimbered manor house at Roe Green Park, London for Mary, dowager Duchess of Sutherland, the wife of Sir Albert Kaye Rollit, M.P.

<doc id="18573392" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18573392" title="Papal conclave, 1294">
Papal conclave, 1294

The papal conclave of December 23–24, 1294 was convoked after the abdication of Pope Celestine V in Naples. It was the first papal conclave after Celestine V restored the constitution "Ubi periculum" of Pope Gregory X, suspended by Pope Adrian V in July 1276. From that time every papal election has been a papal conclave. It is the first papal conclave held during the lifetime of the preceding pontiff, the second such occurrence taking place in 2013 following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI.
Abdication of Celestine V.
Celestine V, founder of the Order of Celestines, widely esteemed and venerated for his holiness, was elected to the papacy on July 7, 1294, as a compromise choice after an over two-years long "sede vacante". It quickly became clear that this saintly eremite was wholly incompetent and unsuited for a job as pope. Admitting his own incompetence soon after his election, Celestine expressed the wish to abdicate and return to his solitary cave in the Abruzzi Mountains. However, before doing so he issued two bulls. The first bull established the regulations concerning the abdication of a pope. The second bull ("Quia in futurum", September 28, 1294) restored the constitution "Ubi periculum", which established the papal conclave; the constitution had been suspended by Pope Adrian V in July 1276. During his short papacy, he also created 13 new cardinals. Eventually, on December 13, 1294, Celestine V abdicated the papacy at Naples, three days after confirming the restoration of the institution of the papal conclave.
It has been widely stated that the alleged great influence of the ambitious Cardinal Benedetto Caetani and the pressure he applied on Celestine V were important factors in Celestine's decision to abdicate, but it seems nearly as certain that it was an entirely voluntarily step of the Pope, with the role of Caetani limited to participation in the solution of the legal problems connected with the resignation of a pope. In particular, there were doubts whether a pope could resign at all, and who would be authorized to accept such a resignation.
List of participants.
All 22 living cardinals participated in the conclave; 12 of them were created by Celestine V, five by Nicholas IV, two by Nicholas III, one by Urban IV and one by Honorius IV: Hugh Aycelin, also known as Hughes of Billom, of the French province of the Dominican Order, former lector at the "studium" of Santa Sabina which would develop into the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, "Angelicum" in the 20th century, was made Cardinal-Bishop of the suburbicarian see of Ostia in 1294 and presided over the papal conclave consecrating bishop of Rome the new Pope Boniface VIII on 23 January 1295.
Election of Pope Boniface VIII.
On December 23, 1294, the cardinals assembled in the Castel Nuovo at Naples for the election of the successor of Celestine V. In the first ballot of the evening of that day Cardinal Matteo Orsini Rosso was elected but he refused to accept the papal dignity. On the next day, Christmas Eve, Cardinal Benedetto Caetani, archpriest of the College, received the required majority and took the name of Boniface VIII. Soon after his election he returned to Rome, where on January 23, 1295, he was consecrated to the episcopate by Cardinal-Dean Hugh Aycelin of Ostia, and crowned by Matteo Orsini Rosso, who was archdeacon of the Sacred College.

Founded in 1976 in a house on the town square of Harvard, Massachusetts by Larry Anderson, Kathleen Cushman, and Edward Miller, The Harvard Common Press was purchased in 1981 by the current president and publisher Bruce Shaw. The company remains an independently owned trade publisher, housed in a loft in the South End of Boston.
Parenting Books.
The Nursing Mother's Companion.
In 1984, an unsolicited manuscript arrived at the company's new office in Boston. The manuscript—"The Nursing Mother's Companion", by Kathleen Huggins—was the first comprehensive handbook on breastfeeding issues ever to be published. Still in print, now in its fifth edition, and with sales topping 1,000,000, "The Nursing Mother's Companion" remains the standard in the category. It has been the cornerstone of a childcare publishing program renowned for its combination of professional advice and nurturing support.
The Joy of Pregnancy.
In 2008, The Harvard Common Press published "The Joy of Pregnancy", by Tori Kropp. Kropp, a childbirth educator and perinatal nurse for more than twenty years, wrote the book in response to what she perceived as a trend of women becoming more anxious about pregnancy than necessary. She saw women in her classes who had read many pregnancy books, and became unnecessarily worried that every ache signaled some dire problem with the baby. Kropp's book aimed to provide a sound medical perspective on pregnancy, while maintaining a calm, supportive, reassuring, and candid tone that she felt was missing from other pregnancy guides. 
The book was met with critical praise: 
""(The Joy of Pregnancy) is a refreshing mix of medical information and helpful, nonjudgmental advice, which urges readers to inform themselves but also to relax and enjoy the special time and anticipation of pregnancy. Years of experience working with pregnant women gives Kropp a reassuring voice, and her book is sure to leave readers feeling more prepared—and less frightened—about the journey of pregnancy."" - Publishers Weekly 
""This deserves to be on all consumer and public library shelves, not least because it has the most up-to-date information available but because the information is so clear and compassionate. Partly in reaction to several of the current best-selling pregnancy guides, Kropp… has written a book that does not belabor potential problem areas during this ten-month journey. Instead, she gives similar coverage to both the joyful and the challenging aspects without being alarmist. Kropp keeps the excitement of pregnancy alive..."" - Library Journal

The field guide format and design made the books unique.
Not Your Mother's Cookbooks.
In 2005, The Harvard Common Press published a slow cooker cookbook titled "Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook", by Beth Hensperger and Julie Kaufmann. The title fast became a new culinary catch phrase. Harvard Common Press registered the moniker and this initiated a series of books creating the "Not Your Mother's" series, presenting contemporary, healthful recipes that are designed for practical everyday use. The runaway success of the first book led to two more books of slow cooker recipes: "Not Your Mother's Slow Cook Recipes for Two", by Beth Hensperger; and "Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Recipes for Entertaining", a companion volume to the first "Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker" book, by Beth Hensperger and Julie Kaufmann.

"The Wheels on the Bus" is an anonymous United States folk song dating to the late-20th century. It is a popular children's song, particularly among pre-teens, in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and is often sung by children on bus trips to keep themselves amused. It has a very repetitive rhythm, making the song both easy for a large number of people to sing, in a manner similar to the song "99 Bottles of Beer". It is based on the traditional British song "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush".
Mad Donna's cover version.
Lyrics 
The wheels on the bus go round and round 
Round and round, Round and round 
The wheels on the bus go round and round 
All day long. 
More verses: 
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep etc. 
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish etc. 
The people on the bus go chatter, chatter, chatter etc. 
The baby on the bus goes wah, wah, wah etc. 
The bell on the bus goes ding, ding, ding etc. 
In 2002 British Madonna impersonator "Mad Donna" had a hit with the song, featuring a version of Madonna's "Ray of Light" over which the classic children's song was sung. The single reached #17 in the United Kingdom and also made the charts elsewhere in Europe.

PTL Satellite Network

The PTL Television Network -- often referred to as simply PTL -- was a global evangelical Christian television network based in Fort Mill, South Carolina, founded by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker in 1974. PTL Satellite Network was dedicated in April 1977. During PTL's fourteen-year history, the Bakkers, as hosts of the network's flagship talk show, "The PTL Club", became two of the most recognizable and highly rated televangelists in the United States. However, the PTL ministry would collapse in 1987, after a former church secretary, Jessica Hahn, accused the evangelist of rape, and later financial scandals purported that the couple had used the non-profit PTL's donations to fund an opulent personal lifestyle. Bakker would be sent to prison for embezzlement in 1989. 
After PTL declared bankruptcy, the cable network was sold in 1989 to Morris Cerullo World Evangelism of San Diego, California and came to be known as "The Inspiration Network", now headquartered at new facilities that were recently constructed in nearby Indian Land, South Carolina. The Inspiration Network operates as a separate and distinct entity chaired by Morris Cerullo's son David.
Background.
In 1960, Jim Bakker met Tammy Faye LaValley while both were students at North Central University in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Tammy Faye worked in a boutique for a time while Jim found work in a restaurant inside a department store in Minneapolis. They were married on April 1, 1961, and left the Bible College to become itinerant evangelists. 
In 1966, the Bakkers began working at Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Virginia, which at the time barely reached an audience of thousands. The Bakkers would make great contributions to CBN as a nationally recognized television ministry. The couple hosted "The Jim and Tammy Show", a variety program hosted by the Bakkers and several puppet characters. The program was aimed at young children, whom they entertained with comic routines with the puppets, as well as airings of "Davey and Goliath", a claymation Bible-story series. Due to the success of "The Jim and Tammy Show", Robertson made Bakker the host of a new prime-time talk show called "The 700 Club", which would gradually become CBN's flagship program, and become syndicated on numerous cable channels and network affiliates.
In the early 1970s, the Bakkers left CBN and traveled, holding telethons at Christian TV stations. In Charlotte, North Carolina, the Bakkers set up Trinity Broadcasting Network with TV executives Sandy and Martha Wheeler, who began airing a local version of "Praise the Lord" on WRET, Channel 36, owned by Ted Turner at the time. The Bakkers moved to California, teaming with their former youth pastors Paul and Jan Crouch, to create the "Praise the Lord" show for the Crouches' new Trinity Broadcasting Network in California. However, the relationship only lasted about eight months due to a falling-out between Jim Bakker and Paul Crouch, causing the Bakkers to leave this ministry as well. Trinity Broadcasting Systems was based in Charlotte, NC and the California entity was named Trinity Broadcasting Network, which would grow to become the world's largest faith-based network in later years. Before leaving and moving east, the Bakkers managed to retain the rights to use the initials "PTL". What began as a local TV broadcast in Charlotte changed when several members of the Bakker's staff in California moved to Charlotte in February 1974 and with the local staff built Trinity Broadcasting Systems into what became known as the PTL Television Network. The parent company changed its name to Heritage Village Church & Missionary Fellowship in 1976–77. The purchase of the Heritage USA properties in Fort Mill, SC began at that time. The PTL Satellite Network uplinked from Heritage Village on Park Road in Charlotte until December 1986. The Heritage Village Property was sold and satellite and video tape editing operations moved to Heritage USA.
Scandals.
PTL's fund raising activities between 1984 and 1987 underwent scrutiny by "The Charlotte Observer" newspaper, eventually leading to criminal charges against Jim Bakker. From 1984 to 1987, Bakker and his PTL associates sold $1,000 "lifetime memberships", which entitled buyers to a three-night stay annually at a luxury hotel at Heritage USA. According to the prosecution at Bakker's later fraud trial, tens of thousands of memberships had been sold, but only one 500-room hotel was ever completed. Bakker "sold" more "exclusive partnerships" than could be accommodated, while raising more than twice the money needed to build the actual hotel. A good deal of the money went into Heritage USA's operating expenses, and Bakker kept $3.4 million in bonuses for himself. The $279,000 payoff for the silence of Jessica Hahn, a woman who was mistakenly supposed to be a Bakker staff member, was paid by Tammy Faye's later husband, Roe Messner. Hahn was actually a one-time acquaintance of Bakker, set up by a "friend" in 1980. 
Bakker, who apparently made all of the financial decisions for the PTL organization, allegedly kept two sets of books to conceal the accounting irregularities. Reporters from "The Charlotte Observer", led by Charles Shepard, investigated and published a series of articles regarding the PTL organization's finances.
On March 19, 1987, following the revelation of a payoff to Jessica Hahn to keep secret her allegation that Bakker had raped her, Bakker resigned from PTL. Bakker acknowledges he met Hahn at a hotel room in Clearwater Beach, Florida, but denies raping her. Following Bakker's resignation as PTL head, he was succeeded in late March, 1987, by Jerry Falwell. Later that summer, as donations sharply declined in the wake of Bakker's resignation and the end of the Bakkers' popular "PTL Club" TV show, Falwell raised $20 million to help keep the Heritage USA Theme Park solvent, including a well-publicized waterslide plunge there. Falwell called Bakker a liar, an embezzler, a sexual deviant, and "the greatest scab and cancer on the face of Christianity in 2,000 years of church history." In 1988, Falwell said that the Bakker scandal had "strengthened broadcast evangelism and made Christianity stronger, more mature and more committed". Bakker's son, Jay, wrote in 2001 that the Bakkers felt betrayed by Falwell, who they thought, at the time of Bakker's resignation, intended to help in Bakker's eventual restoration as head of the PTL ministry organization.
Aftermath.
Following a 16-month Federal grand jury probe, Bakker was indicted in 1988 on eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy. In 1989, after a five-week trial which began on August 28 in Charlotte, the jury found him guilty on all 24 counts, and Judge Robert Potter sentenced him to 45 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine.
He served time in the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Rochester, Minnesota, sharing a cell with activist Lyndon LaRouche and skydiver Roger Nelson.
In early 1991, a federal appeals court upheld Bakker's conviction on the fraud and conspiracy charges, but voided Bakker's 45-year sentence, as well as the $500,000 fine, and ordered that a new sentencing hearing be held.
Jim and Tammy Bakker were divorced on March 13, 1992. On November 16, 1992, a sentence reduction hearing was held and Bakker's sentence was reduced to eight years.
In August 1993, Bakker was transferred to a minimum security federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, and was subsequently granted parole in July 1994, after serving almost five years of his sentence. Bakker's son, Jay, spearheaded a letter-writing campaign to the parole board on his father's behalf, urging leniency. 
His Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) number was 07407-058, and he was released from BOP custody on December 1, 1994.
On July 23, 1996, a North Carolina jury threw out a class action suit brought on behalf of more than 160,000 onetime supporters who contributed as much as $7,000 each to Bakker's coffers in the 1980s. 
"The Charlotte Observer" reported that the Internal Revenue Service still holds Bakker and Roe Messner, Tammy Faye's husband from 1993 until her death in 2007, liable for personal income taxes owed from the 1980s when they were building the PTL empire, taxes assessed after the IRS revoked the PTL ministry's nonprofit status. Tammy Faye Messner's new husband said that the original tax amount was about $500,000, with penalties and interest accounting for the rest. Notices stating the IRS liens list still identify "James O. and Tamara F. Bakker" as owing $6,000,000, liens on which Jim Bakker still pays.

Bothrops neuwiedi

Bothrops neuwiedi is a venomous pit viper species endemic to South America. This relatively small snake has a wide range and is a major source of snakebite in Argentina. It was named after German naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied (1782-1867), who made important collections in Brazil (1815-1817). Twelve subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.
Description.
Adults average 60-70 cm (23½-27½ inches) in total length, but may grow to as much as 100 cm (39 in).
Head scalation includes 7-11 keeled intrasupraoculars (rarely 12 or as few as five), 9-13 sublabials (usually 10-11) and seven to eight supralabials (rarely seven or 10), the second of which is not fused with and usually separated from the prelacunal. Two rows of small scales usually separate the subocular and fourth supralabial scales. At midbody the 22-29 (usually 25-27) rows of dorsal scales are strongly keeled. The ventral scales number 158-179 and 164-185 in males and females, respectively, while the subcaudal scales are divided and number 39-56 or 34-51 in males or females.
The color pattern consists of a brown or dark-brown ground color overlaid with a series of 16-27 dark brown or black dorsolateral blotches. The blotches are edged in white and may be trapezoidal, triangular, subtriangular, or headphone-shaped and oppose each other middorsally. The belly is white or yellow with gray speckling. Juveniles have a white tail tip.
Geographic range.
This species is found in South America east of the Andes and south of approx. 5°S, including Brazil (southern Maranhão, Piauí, Ceará, Bahia, Goiás, Mato Grosso, an isolated population in Amazonas, Rondônia and all southern states), Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina (Catamarca, Córdoba, Corrientes, Chaco, Entre Ríos, Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, Misiones, Salta, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero and Tucumán) and Uruguay. According to Vanzolini (1981), the type locality given is ""provincia Bahiae"" (Bahia province, Brazil).
Habitat.
It inhabits tropical and semitropical deciduous forest, as well as temperate forest and Atlantic Coast restingas, and is associated with dry or semiarid rocky areas in almost all cases.
Venom.
It is one of the main causes of snakebite in Argentina: between 1960 and 1975, according to Esteso (1985), 80% of the approximately 500 cases reported each year were attributed to "B. n. diporus".
In a review of the symptoms in all 18 bite cases for this species admitted to the hospital in São Paulo between 1975 and 1992, Jorge and Ribeiro (2000) found all suffered pain, 83% had swelling, 50% had bruising, 17% had necrosis, 12% developed coagulopathy and 5% had abscesses. In a case in Germany, a 36-year-old snake keeper was bitten on the finger and developed hemorrhagic "necrosis" of the afflicted digit and swelling that extended onto the hand. Five hours after being bitten, his blood had a normal platelet count, but was incoagulable with a reduced fibrinogen concentration, elevated fibrin degradation products and D-dimer.
Three different antivenins, Soro Antibotropico-Crotalico, Soro Antibotropico-Laquetico and Soro Botropico, can be used to treat bites from this species. All three are manufactured by the Instituto Butantan in Brazil and contain specific antibodies to counteract the effects of the venom.
Taxonomy.
The twelve subspecies listed above were recognized by Peters and Orejas-Miranda (1970), Campbell and Lamar (1989) and Golay "et al." (1993). A revision by Silva (2000) elevated seven taxa to full species: "B. neuwiedi", "B. diporus", "B. lutzi", "B. mattogrossensis", "B. pauloensis", "B. pubescens" and one unnamed new species. In some cases, intergradation may occur. Together, these are referred to as the "Bothrops neuwiedi" complex.

Bavarian Localbahn Society

The Bavarian Localbahn Society ("Bayerischer Localbahnverein e.V." or BLV), with its headquarters in Tegernsee, is a society that is concerned with the history of the railways in Bavaria. "Localbahn" (sometimes "Lokalbahn"; literally: 'local line') means 'branch line' and is mainly used in southern Germany and Austria in lieu of the usual term "Nebenbahn". The BLV's objectives are the operation of historic trains and the collection of historically valuable railway items from Bavaria.
Operations.
The society runs the "Localbahn Museum" in Bayerisch Eisenstein and a locomotive shed in Landshut. It also operates the museum railway Tegernsee-Schaftlach-Holzkirchen
Localbahn Museum.
The BLV dedicated its museum to the once common branch lines of the railway - called "Vicinalbahnen", "Sekundärbahnen" or "Localbahnen" - which connected most of Bavaria in the 19th century. Many of them have now fallen prey to the structural changes or have been changed to suburban trains in the vicinity of large cities.
The museum is installed in the former engine shed of Bayerisch Eisenstein on the border to the Czech Republic. The round shed with its seven tracks as well as the two-tracked long house contain steam engines, electric and diesel locomotives, passenger coaches as well as goods wagons from 1890 to 1949. Special exhibitions cover issues such as the construction of railway lines. The open-air area has a working turntable. On some weekends the museum offers rides to Bohemia with historical steam trains. The society also owns a restored local steam train and offers rides from Landshut.
History.
The Bavarian Localbahn Society emerged from a working group of the German Railway History Company ("Deutsche Gesellschaft für Eisenbahngeschichte" or DGEG), that ran steam train services between 1969 and 1975 on the private Tegernsee Railway ("Tegernsee-Bahn"). Because the operating licence for the locomotive (TAG 7) ran out and neither DGEG nor the Tegernsee Railway wanted to take on the cost of the general inspection, the Bavarian Localbahn Society was founded. To keep operations going during the period whilst TAG 7 was out of service the steam engine 378.32 was purchased in Austria. In 1978, TAG 7 was once again back in service as well, and the Austrian engine took over historical steam services on the Regen Valley railway until it was sold in 1996. The engine, J. A. Maffei, was also working on the Tegernsee Railway until the 1990s and now stands in the society's own museum. The Bavarian Localbahn Museum was established between 1981 and 1994, in the old locomotive shed built in Bayerisch Eisenstein in 1877. In 1999 the shed and tracks at Tegernsee had to be cleared and the TAG 7 steam train moved to Landshut. Since 2005 the society has once again owned an operational steam engine, a former Bavarian Pt 2/3, number 70 083. On September 11, 2005 the BLV celebrated its 30 years of existence with both a Class 70 and the TAG 7 steam engines operating.
Rolling stock.
Other rolling stock.
The society has over 19 passenger coaches from the period 1889 to 1958, 8 goods wagons from the years 1883 to 1920 as well as various inspection trolleys.
Organisation.
The BLV has at present around 300 members. The company offices are in Tegernsee. The Localbahn Museum at Bayerisch Eisenstein is under the private trusteeship of the society.

N. Koppelman

N. Kopelman (Koppelman) (1881 ? – 1944, Moscow?) was a Russian chess player.
He participated in Mannheim 1914 chess tournament. After the declaration of war against Russia, eleven "Russian" players (Alexander Alekhine, Bogoljubov, Bogatyrchuk, Flamberg, Koppelman, Maliutin, Rabinovich, Romanovsky, Saburov, Selezniev, Weinstein) were interned in Rastatt, Germany. On September 14, 17, and 29, 1914, four of them (Alekhine, Bogatyrchuk, Saburov, and Koppelman) were freed and allowed to return home via Switzerland.
He took 7th at St. Petersburg 1915 (Alexander Ilyin-Zhenevsky and Golubev won), and took 8th at Moscow 1920 (All-Russian Chess Olympiad, elim., Alexei Alekhine won).

Four-day week

A four-day week is an arrangement where a workplace or school has its employees or students work or attend school over the course of four days rather than the more customary five. This arrangement can be a part of flexible working hours, and is sometimes used to cut costs.
In 2008, employees of the Utah state government all began working ten-hour days from Monday to Thursday. By closing state government offices on Fridays, the state expected to save on operating costs such as electricity, heat, air conditioning, and gasoline for state-owned vehicles. Many local governments have had alternative schedules for many years. 
Public schools in Hawaii closed on 17 Fridays in 2010. Over 100 school districts in rural areas in the United States changed the school week to a four-day week; most also extended each school day by an hour or more. The changes were often made in order to save money on transportation, heating, and substitute teachers.
