For the first time in Olympic history, all eight swimmers went faster than a winning time of 1:58.03, previously set by Potec in Athens four years earlier.
Earlier in the prelims, Pang broke one of the oldest Olympic records in the book, when she clocked at 1:57.37 to lead the fourth heat, slashing 0.28 seconds off the old, drug-tainted mark set by East Germany's Heike Friedrich from Seoul in 1988. Two heats later, Pellegrini posted a top-seeded time of 1:55.45 to erase Laure Manaudou's world record, set in 2007.

Type 14 10 cm Cannon

The was the first medium caliber cannon totally of Japanese design and the first with a split trail carriage. The Type 14 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 14th year of Emperor Taishō's reign (1925). It was used Imperial Japanese Army but was not considered successful and was replaced by the Type 92 10 cm Cannon.
History and development.
Following reports based on first-hand observation of European artillery tactics in World War I by Japanese military observers, the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff instructed the Army Technical Bureau to begin work on new designs to modernize Japan's largely antiquated artillery. One priority was the development of a medium caliber artillery piece that would be able to provide greater firepower than the standard 75mm artillery currently in front line service. However, Japan lacked much of the technical expertise or industrial infrastructure to develop such as weapon, and initial prototypes issued as the "Type 7 10cm cannon" and the "Type 12 10cm cannon" were rejected as unsatisfactory.
However, with the incorporation of advancement in design taken from contemporary Schneider designs, the Type 14 10 cm Cannon was finally accepted into service in 1925. However, due to technical and budgetary issues, only a total of 64 units were produced.
Design.
The Type 14 10 cm Cannon was similar in design to the earlier Type 38 10 cm Cannon, which was in turn based on a 1905 Krupp design, but is notable in that it was the first design done independently in Japan. It had an interrupted screw breechblock, a hydropneumatic recoil mechanism, heavy wooden wheels, and a split trail.
Ammunition was semifixed, with High-explosive, armor-piercing warhead, shrapnel, and gas shells, and time fuzes for smoke and incendiary projectiles.
It was designed to be transportable by a team of eight draft horses. However, in 1931, a tractor was designed for use with the Type 14, with a 50 horsepower diesel engine, which greatly increased its transportability, albeit at a top speed of 8 miles per hour.
Combat record.
The Type 14 10 cm Cannon proved disappointing in terms of range and accuracy, and was not regarded as a successful design. The units which were completed with assigned to reserve and training units in the Japanese home islands, and were not deployed overseas in World War II.

Polkowo, Podlaskie Voivodeship

Polkowo is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Sztabin, within Augustów County, province of Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.
It lies on the Netta River, 2 "viorsts" (approximately 2 kilometers) from the outlet to the Biebrza river. The village stands on one of the few small dry islands emerging from the extensive muddy banks of the Biebzra and the Netta rivers. Polkowo is 28 "viorsts" from Augustów.(Vol. 9, p. 495-496). Warsaw.</ref>
History.
The village was founded on June 23, 1582 during the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Crimean Tatar slave-raiding. A Suwałki County official issued a decree from the city of Rajgrod (northwest of Polkowo) granting peasants Mark (Markowie) and Elizabeth (Elzbiece) Konoza (Konozie) the right to settle on the hillock of Polikow (later referred to as the village of Polkowo) near the river Biebrza (current day Biebrza National Park).
Additional chronology.
May 3, 1585 ° Queen Anna issued a decree from Warsaw confirming the initial land grant 
1587 ° Boundaries of Polkowo were determined to be 5 wlok (approximately 150 acres) 
September 13, 1639 ° Rajgrod court lowered rent for land from 50 to 10 Polish zloty 
1661 ° Land grant reaffirmed by King Kazimierz 
1664 ° Descendants thrived and multiplied consisting of five families
Conflict.
In 1777 an armed conflict arose when a landlord of the royal estates chose to impose on the citizens of Polkowo demands for labor, additional payments and higher rents; these citizens initiated a lawsuit (litigants included Mateusz and Marianna Kawalkow Konoza) in the royal court which took several years to resolve; allegations were that the landlord conducted raids of the village, taking oxen, horses and personal possessions; they were also accused of assaults.
In 1778 the court sent a special commission to investigate, which found for the villagers and relieved them of additional requirements. An appeal suspended the ruling. 
In 1781 a subsequent commission again held for the villagers, but their lease payments were increased to 200 Polish zloty; "Polkowianie" (the people of Polkowo) at that time consisted of 20 hamlets. In the late eighteenth century the villages of Polkowo, Kopytkowo and Jasionowo, were collectively referred to as district of Bojary.
In 1827, Polkowo consisted of 29 homes and 170 inhabitants, and in 1888 it had 37 homes, 361 inhabitants.

Ration Bored

Ration Bored is the ninth animated cartoon short subject in the "Woody Woodpecker" series. Released theatrically on July 26, 1943, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures.
Plot.
While driving his car, Woody sees a sign that reads: "Conserve gas & tires. Is this trip really necessary?" Woody refers to himself as a "necessary evil" while changing his appearance briefly into a demonic version of itself with deranged eyes and speeds down the road after changing back again. While cresting a hill, he runs out of gas and rolls to the gas station below.
The gas attendant asks to see Woody's "ABC" book (see below), and Woody hands him an alphabet book. Insulted, the attendant grabs a hammer and knocks Woody's car into a salvage yard. Woody decides to steal gasoline from the wrecked vehicles in the lot. He unknowingly siphons gas from a parked police car.
A cop chases Woody around the salvage yard. They get caught up in stacks of tires, and Woody ends up riding the cop like an automobile out of the yard and into a large storage unit of gasoline.
In heaven, the cop leaves the "Wing Rationing Board" with a small pair of wings. He starts chasing Woody again when he realizes that the wings Woody has received are much larger.
Woody's appearance.
Walter Lantz had been criticized from the start that Woody's garish appearance was detrimental to the appeal of the burgeoning star. The addition of white gloves on Woody's hands (like those of cartoon counterparts Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny) marked the first notable attempt at giving the woodpecker a more streamlined character design. By the following film, "The Barber of Seville", Woody's appearance would get a complete makeover, making "Ration Bored" the last "Woody Woodpecker" film featuring the original manic design.
Production notes.
"Ration Bored" would be the last "Woody Woodpecker" "cartune" in the series to not use a standardized opening title sequence. It is also the "Woody Woodpecker" entry to be directed by storyman Milt Schaffer and animator Emery Hawkins. They filled in for the previous series directors Walter Lantz and Alex Lovy; Lantz had stopped directing films for several years and Lovy had left the studio after working on "The Dizzy Acrobat" to serve in the war. With the next entry, "The Barber of Seville", they would be replaced by veteran animator James "Shamus" Culhane as series director.
Cultural references.
"Ration Bored" is a spoof on army rationing. During World War II United States citizens were asked to conserve gasoline and rubber, as well as other items and food supplies. Decisions on rationing were made by a Ration Board, hence the punning title.
The gas station attendant refers to a ration book as an "ABC book". During the 1940s war ration, American automobiles were classified as either A, B, C, T, or X.

Congregation Beth Israel-Judea

Congregation Beth Israel-Judea is a Reform synagogue located at 625 Brotherhood Way in San Francisco, California. It is the result of the merger of the Conservative Congregation Beth Israel and the Reform Temple Judea.
Beth Israel was founded in 1860 as an Orthodox congregation. Members worshiped in leased premises, first on Sutter Street, and then a larger space on Mission Street. In 1879 the congregation completed its first building on Turk Street, but soon outgrew it, and in 1891 constructed a new synagogue building on Geary Street. In 1908 it constructed a larger synagogue building on Geary Street, where it remained until 1969. By this time the congregation had moved to Conservative Judaism. The congregation's rabbis were M. Wolf (1860–1874), A. (Nahum) Streisand (1874–1878), Aron J. Messing (1878–1890), Meyer Solomon Levy (1890–1916), Herman Lissauer (1916–1926), and Elliot M. Burstein (1927–1969). Joseph Rabinowitz was cantor from 1891 to 1943.
Temple Judea was founded in 1953, the first Reform synagogue built in San Francisco in almost 125 years. Its first rabbi was Robert W. Shapiro, and he was succeeded by Irving Reichert and then Herbert Morris in 1962. In 1964 Temple Judea completed a synagogue building at 625 Brotherhood Way.
The two synagogues merged in 1969, adopting practices from both congregations, and moving to Temple Judea's building. Morris became the rabbi of the combined congregation, and Burstein became rabbi emeritus. Morris retired in 1998, was succeeded by Evan Goodman. Goodman left in 2006, and was succeeded by Rosalind Glazer.
Early history.
Congregation Beth Israel.
Early premises.
Congregation Beth Israel was founded as an Orthodox synagogue in San Francisco in 1860, and subsequently became "the first conservative congregation west of Chicago." From 1860 to 1874 the congregation worshiped in a leased building on Sutter Street between Dupont and Stockton Streets. During this period the rabbi was M. Wolf. Beth Israel then leased a larger building on Mission Street, between Fifth and Sixth Streets for four years, led by A. (Nachum/Nahum) Streisand. Born in Posen in 1819, Streisand had been a student of Akiva Eiger, and had served as a "maggid" (itinerant preacher) in the Ukraine and in Posen. In 1869, he emigrated to the United States, where he served as rabbi of New York City's (then) Orthodox Congregation Shaare Zedek. He moved from New York to San Francisco in 1874 to take the position of rabbi at Beth Israel. Streisand was succeeded by Aron J. Messing in 1877 or 1878, and died in San Francisco in January 1879.
Messing was also born in Posen, in 1839 or 1840, and studied divinity at the University of Graz. He emigrated to the United States in 1866, to serve as rabbi of New York City's Beth Israel Bikur Cholim. In 1870 he moved to San Francisco's Congregation Sherith Israel, but could not convince the members to become Orthodox, and returned to Chicago three years later. He return to San Francisco to serve at the then-Orthodox Beth Israel. When he joined Beth Israel, it had eighty member families, and within a year that had more than doubled. Beth Israel was considered a "Polish" congregation at the time, but had many German-Jewish members, and Messing gave his sermons in German.
Though services were traditional, the congregation instituted "strict rules of decorum", which were given in some detail in its 1878 constitution. These included prohibitions against gathering outside the sanctuary, talking during services, entering or leaving at various times during the services, praying out loud or with "all manner of intonations", wearing the "tallit" over the head, taking off the "tallit" before the end of services, or bringing in children under 6 years of age. The constitution also detailed exactly when congregants had to stand during the services.
To accommodate continued growth, the congregation built its first synagogue on Turk Street between Jones and Taylor Streets, and dedicated it in 1879. The congregation outgrew the Turk Street building and, in 1891, built a new synagogue at 1411 Geary Street, near Octavia.
Geary Street.
Messing had served as rabbi until 1890, and was succeeded that year by M.S. (Myer Solomon) Levy. Levy was born in England in January 1852 and raised there, the son of Rabbi Solomon Levy of Borough Synagogue in London. Myer Solomon had been ordained in England as an Orthodox rabbi before he was twenty, and moved to Australia as a young man. An early supporter of Zionism, he had served as a rabbi in Melbourne before moving to California in 1872 or 1873, where he served as the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El (then Bickur Cholim) in San Jose. He then served at the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland for ten years, but found the congregation not traditional enough for him, and moved to Beth Israel. At Beth Israel he "organized a Hebrew School and a Sunday School, a sisterhood, and a men's club". During his tenure, the congregation's religious orientation was Modern Orthodox.
Joseph Rabinowitz joined Beth Israel as cantor the year the synagogue building at 1411 Geary Street was constructed. A "rich baritone" from a "famous family of Lithuanian cantors", he sang at Beth Israel until 1943. Despite Beth Israel's traditionalism, he was accompanied by both a mixed choir (that included women), and an organ.
In 1905, the congregation started construction of an even larger synagogue building on 1839 Geary Street between Fillmore and Steiner Streets. It was nearing completion when it was destroyed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. At the time, the congregation had 200 member families, and an income of $15,800 (today $). Services were held on "Shabbat" and the Jewish holidays. The congregational school had 250 students and five teachers. The members re-built at the 1839 Geary Street location, and dedicated the building in 1908. An "imposing brick-and-steel" structure, it had an "elaborate wood-carved "bimah"" and stained-glass windows. Known as the Geary Street Temple, it was "the most visible symbol of traditional Judaism in the city for more than half a century."
Herman Lissauer succeeded Levy as rabbi in 1916, the year he graduated from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA). By 1919, the congregation had 325 member families. The congregational school held classes five days a week, and had 250 students and twelve teachers. Lissauer would serve until 1926, then move to San Francisco's Congregation Emanu-El, and subsequently become head of the Warner Bros. Research Department.
Lissauer was succeeded in 1927 by Elliot M. (Maurice) Burstein, who would remain rabbi at Beth Israel for over four decades. Born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1899, Burstein graduated from Columbia College in 1919. He was ordained at the JTSA in 1923, where he also earned a Master of Hebrew Literature degree. Burstein was politically liberal and a Zionist, and served for five years as the president of the Zionist Organization of San Francisco. During his tenure, Beth Israel "gravitated towards Conservative Judaism".
Temple Judea.
Temple Judea was founded in 1953, the first Reform synagogue built in San Francisco in almost 125 years. Robert W. Shapiro was the congregation's first rabbi. In 1957 it purchased land on Stanley Drive, and convinced the city to change the street's name to Brotherhood Way.
In the late 1950s Irving F. Reichert served as Temple Judea's part-time rabbi for three years. Reichert had formerly served as rabbi of Tremont Temple/Scarsdale Synagogue in the Bronx from 1923 to 1930, and San Francisco's Congregation Emanu-El from 1930 to 1947, before retiring from the pulpit at age 53. He was a strong anti-Zionist who supported the creation of the American Council for Judaism (ACJ), and following his retirement from Emanu-El, he served for five years as the executive director of the ACJ's western region.
Herbert Morris was hired as rabbi in 1962. Born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1930, Morris's first rabbinic position had been two years as a chaplain with the United States Navy in Japan in 1956. He subsequently served as a chaplain for the San Francisco Police Department.
The year after Morris joined, Temple Judea sold some of the still-undeveloped land on Brotherhood Way to the Jewish Community Center. That same year the synagogue began construction of a new building, which it completed in 1964 at 625 Brotherhood Way.
Merger to present.
In 1969 the Congregation Beth Israel and Temple Judea merged, after three major potential impediments were resolved: the synagogue would have a "restricted kosher kitchen", Temple Judea's Friday night Torah readings would continue, and the rabbi would still perform intermarriages. Temple Judea's Morris became the rabbi of the combined congregation, and Beth Israel's Burstein became rabbi emeritus. The new congregation moved to Temple Judea's building on Brotherhood Way. The Geary Street Temple eventually became derelict, but was purchased in the late 1980s and renovated by designer Tony Duquette. In 1989, soon after the renovations were complete, it burnt down, and a post office was later built in its place.
At the merged Beth Israel-Judea, Friday night services were Reform-oriented, while Saturday morning services had "a Conservative feel". Morris created a new High Holy Day prayerbook for the congregation "combining liturgy of the Reform and Conservative movements". He created a Bar and Bat Mitzvah program for adults, and was a "firm supporter of women's causes civil rights". He also supported Israel, and introduced the practice of confirmation class trips there. In 1976 the congregation built a religious school, and by 1995 there were 486 member families.
Morris retired in 1998, and Beth Israel-Judea hired Evan Goodman as his successor. Goodman had previously served as rabbi of Beth El in San Mateo, California for five and a half years. Morris died in 2003, while Goodman served at Beth Israel-Judea until leaving in 2006 to take a position at Temple Israel in New Rochelle, New York. That year Rosalind Glazer, a graduate of the Reconstructionist rabbinical college, joined as rabbi.
In the late summer of 2011, the congregation hired Rabbi Danny Gottlieb, who was previously rabbi of Temple Kol Ami in Thornhill, Ontario. 
, Beth Israel-Judea was a member of the Reform movement. The rabbi was Danny Gottlieb.

Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's 800 metre freestyle

The women's 800 metre freestyle event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 14 and 16 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. 
Great Britain's Rebecca Adlington broke one of the world records in the book to claim a second Olympic gold, following her first triumph in the 400 m freestyle. She touched the wall first in 8:14.10, slashing 2.12-second deficit off Janet Evans' world record which had stood for nearly 19 years. Sitting in the stands of the Water Cube, Evans found a kindred spirit in Adlington as she looked down on the British teenager breaking a long-lasting world record, and then congratulated her.
Coming from sixth place in the 350-metre lap, Italy's Alessia Filippi registered a time of 8:20.23 for a silver medal. Lotte Friis ended Denmark's 20-year medal drought in swimming to claim a bronze in 8:23.03, edging out Romania's Camelia Potec (8:23.03) on the final lap by eight-hundredths of a second. China's Li Xuanxu finished fifth with a time of 8:26.34, and was followed in the sixth spot by Australia's Kylie Palmer in 8:26.39. Russia's Yelena Sokolova (8:29.79) and another Brit Cassandra Patten (8:32.35) rounded out the finale. Notable swimmers missed out the top 8 final featuring U.S. top favorites Katie Hoff and Kate Ziegler, both of whom placed tenth and eleventh in the prelims race.
Earlier in the prelims, Adlington established a new Olympic standard in a top-seeded time of 8:18.06 to cut down Brooke Bennett's 2000 record by a 1.59-second deficit.

List of GO Transit bus routes

Each train route has a corresponding GO Bus service for the times (and directions) when (and where) the trains are not operating. These accept the same tickets as the trains and in many cases serve the same stations. For example, buses operate from Toronto to Milton, and from Aldershot station in West Burlington to Hamilton, at all times except the weekday evening peak when trains are available. Some train routes are similarly extended by buses at all times, as noted in the list of routes, with through buses when the trains do not run. For example buses to Guelph operate from Georgetown during peak times, and from Toronto at off-peak times. Buses serving downtown Toronto operate to a terminal adjacent to Union Station.
Other GO Buses are independent of rail services. Some parts of the route network use expressways (such as the frequent Toronto–Hamilton express bus via the Queen Elizabeth Way) while others are more local in character. Toronto Pearson International Airport is served by two routes: one from Brampton to Yorkdale and York Mills subway stations, and one to Richmond Hill Centre Terminal.
GO bus fares depend on the origin and destination of the trip. Some local municipal bus services offer fare integration, which offers a lower fare in conjunction with a trip on a GO bus. GO buses also offer use of the Presto card.
List of Discontinued GO Bus Services.
During GO train service disruptions on the Lakeshore West or Lakeshore East lines, replacement shuttle buses use Route 1 for the Lakeshore West line and Route 9 for the Lakeshore East line.

The women's 100 metre backstroke event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 10–12 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. 
U.S. swimmer Natalie Coughlin set a lifetime best and an American record of 58.96 to defend her title in the event. Zimbabwe's new world record holder Kirsty Coventry added a second silver to her hardware from the 400 m individual medley two days earlier, in a time of 59.19. Coming from fifth place in the turn, Margaret Hoelzer continued her impressive form in the shorter backstroke to pick up a bronze in 59.34, handing the entire medal haul for Team USA in the pool.
Great Britain's Gemma Spofforth narrowly missed the podium by four-hundredths of a second (0.04), posting a European record of 59.38 for a fourth-place finish. Russia's Anastasia Zuyeva finished fifth in a close race at 59.40, and was followed in the sixth spot by Japan's Reiko Nakamura in 59.72. France's Laure Manaudou (1:00.10), bronze medalist in Athens four years earlier, and Japanese Hanae Ito (1:00.18) rounded out the finale.
Earlier in the prelims, Zuyeva, Nakamura, and Coventry scratched out Coughlin's existing Olympic record, as they went under a time of 59.68 to lead all seeded heats. The following morning, in the semifinals, Coventry blitzed the field on the final lap to set a new world record of 58.77, breaking Coughlin's mark by two-tenths of a second (0.20).

<doc id="18625446" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18625446" title="Type 92 10 cm Cannon">
Type 92 10 cm Cannon

The was a field gun used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. The Type 92 number was designated for the year the gun was accepted, 2592 in the Japanese imperial year calendar, or 1932 in the Gregorian calendar. The Type 92 cannon was intended to supersede the Type 14 10cm Cannon in front line combat service.
History and development.
The Type 92 10 cm Cannon was developed from 1923-1924, as a long range alternative to the Imperial Japanese Army's existing 75-mm field artillery. Production was delayed due to technical issues, notably a desire by the Army to reduce the weight of the weapon to a minimal level, and additional requirements issued by the Army in 1927 to increase the range of the yet-to-be-completed weapon to . A suitable prototype was finally completed in 1932, and after extensive testing, went into production and combat service in 1934. A total of only 180 units were produced.
This piece appears to have almost completely replaced the Type 14 10 cm Cannon. It has all the standard features of the 1930-36 period of Japanese gun design. Its long barrel, short cradle, long trails, and relatively low silhouette gives it the most graceful appearance of any Japanese artillery piece. In traveling position the tube is retracted by means of a winch and locked to the cradle. The most remarkable fact about the Type 92, aside from its appearance, is the great range that it attains with a 35-pound shell in proportion to its unusually low weight. It has been reported that the weapon is rarely fired at extreme ranges, which require the use of a supercharge, because of malfunctions in the recoil system caused thereby. Some years ago troubles with the recoil system were so frequent that extra glands and packing for the recoil cylinders were carried in the firing battery, and replacing them was equivalent to first-echelon maintenance in U. S. practice. Difficulties were also reported when the weapon was fired at or near the limits of traverse. Whether this was due to a unique "bug" in the design of the Type 92 or was inherent in the use of spade-plate stabilization is not known. The Model 92 is stabilized by three spade plates for each trail. Both spade plates and trail blocks are demountable.
Design.
Readily recognized by its long slender gun barrel and split carriage trail, the Type 92 10 cm Cannon was designed particularly for long-range fire. The recoil system was hydropneumatic and it had a distinctive three-step interrupted thread breechblock. It fired a shell up to with standard high-explosive shells, and also had provision for special long-range shells that could reach 20,000 yards, as well as chemical, armor-piercing, smoke and incendiary shells.
The gun barrel was extremely long, making field transport very cumbersome. The gun was normally tractor drawn using its large wooden wheels with solid rubber tires, but could also be pulled by a 5-ton truck. Its greatest drawback was that it had spade plates on each trail leg that had to be pounded into the ground to anchor the gun in place.
Combat record.
Despite design issues with transportability, the Type 92 10 cm Cannon was very successful and was used for long-range counter-battery and bombardment roles. It was first used in combat with the IJA 7th Independent Heavy Field Artillery Regiment at the Battle of Nomonhan against the Soviet Red Army. It later was used in the Battle of the Philippines in 1942 during the assaults on Bataan and Corregidor Island, and it was transported to Guadalcanal and used in the bombardment of Henderson Field.

John Stephens (Australian footballer)

John Raymond Stephens (born 15 September 1950) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda in the VFL during the early 1970s. He also represented Victoria at first-class cricket.
Stephens was a goal kicking rover and after managing eleven majors in a VFA game for Sandringham was picked up by St Kilda. 
He played the first six games of the 1971 VFL season before succumbing to a thigh injury which would keep him out of the side for the rest of the year. St Kilda made the Grand Final that year. He was St Kilda Football Clubs leading goalkicker in 1972 and participated in the finals series, but again missed out on playing in the decider when Carlton defeated the Saints in the Preliminary Final, on the back of a seven goal effort from Alex Jesaulenko.
A consistent performer up forward, only four times in his league career did he fail to kick a goal in a game. He topped St Kilda's goal-kicking in 1972 with 53 goals, including four in their Elimination Final win over Essendon.
As a cricketer, Stephens was a left-handed middle order batsman and appeared in a total of four first-class matches in the 1970/71 and 1971/72 Sheffield Shield seasons. On his debut against Queensland at the MCG he made his highest score of 48 in the second innings. Stephens finished his career with a disappointing 123 runs at 15.37. He had played with fellow VFL footballers Peter Bedford, John Scholes and Max Walker.

After claiming three silver medals at these Games, Zimbabwe's Kirsty Coventry stormed home on the final lap to defend her Olympic title in the event. She posted a time of 2:05.24 to crush a world record set by U.S. swimmer Margaret Hoelzer from the Olympic trials one month earlier. Meanwhile, Hoelzer added a silver to her hardware from the 100 m backstroke, when she touched the wall in 2:06.23, the second-fastest effort of her career. Japan's Reiko Nakamura managed to repeat a bronze from Athens four years earlier, in an Asian record of 2:07.13.
Russia's top favorite Anastasia Zuyeva finished fourth with a time of 2:07.88, and was followed in the fifth spot by American teenager Elizabeth Beisel, aged 16, in 2:08.23. Elizabeth Simmonds set a new British record of 2:08.51 to earn a sixth spot, while Aussies Meagan Nay (2:08.84) and Belinda Hocking (2:10.12) closed out the field. Notable swimmers missed out the top 8 final, featuring Russia's Stanislava Komarova, silver medalist in Athens, and British top favorite Gemma Spofforth.
Before her breakthrough final, Coventry broke one of the oldest Olympic records earlier in the prelims. She posted a top-seeded time of 2:06.76 to lead 34 other swimmers in the race, slashing four-tenths of a second (0.40) off the record set by Hungary's three-time Olympic champion Krisztina Egerszegi from Barcelona in 1992.

KCLR (AM)

KCLR (branded as "La Nueva Radio Cristiana") was a radio station serving the Lubbock, Texas metropolitan area with a Spanish language Christian talk radio format. The station broadcast on AM frequency 1530 kHz and was last under the ownership of Paulino Bernal Evangelism. Bernal surrendered the license for KCLR and five other stations to the Federal Communications Commission on Nov. 7, 2013.
The station was founded in 1963 by Phil Crenshaw and Gaylon O. Gilbert. The original power of that station was 1,000 watts, with power being raised to 5,000 watts non-critical hours (two hours after sunrise and two hours before sunset) in 1968. The original owners sold the station to F.T. Wilson in 1969, who then sold the station to Pete C. Rodriguez in 1978. Rodriguez himself later sold the station to Paulino Bernal, the most recent owner, in 1990.
Because it shared the same frequency as Clear Channel station WCKY in Cincinnati, Ohio, KCLR operated only during the daytime hours. The station sought the letters KCLR, or KCLeaR because of its placement on a clear channel.

Synopsis.
After the execution of Jeoffrey de Peyrac, Angélique finds refuge at the Cour des Miracles and the boss Calembredaine, he turns out to be her childhood friend and first love Nicolas. With his help she finds back her children. After a fight between two rivalling gangs, Nicolas is shot and Angélique is arrested and sent to the Châtelet. She asks the captain to let her go rescue her children, he agrees but she has to come back to spend the night with him. Angélique goes to the headquarters of the Grand Coërse and rescues her children. She brings them to Barbe and asks her to take care of them because she has a debt to pay. Angélique returns to the Châtelet where the captain is waiting for her. He tries to kiss her but they struggle and he falls down. She escapes and flees to Barbe who now works in an old run-down inn called "Le coq Hardi". 
After persuading the owner 'Maître Bourjus' to employ her, Angélique renames the inn "Le masque rouge", it is a big hit in Paris. One day she meets her old enemy, Monsieur, brother of the king, accompanied by his noblemen. A tragedy occurs, "Le masque rouge" burns to the ground and Angélique swears revenge. She calls on her friend Claude le Petit aka "Le poète crotté". He writes pamphlets in which they accuse the noblemen surrounding Monsieur. The king disapproves what his brother did but he doesn't like what Angélique is doing. He sends his best policeman to her, the former lawyer of Jeoffrey, Desgrez. He promises her a license to make and sell chocolate and 50.000 livres as compensation for the loss of "Le masque rouge", on the condition that she stops publishing the pamphlets and Monsieur's name isn't mentioned. In her new establishment she then encounters her cousin Philippe de Plessis-Bellières. They have a passionate affair, but Angélique wants him to marry her so she blackmails him with an old secret. Eventually Philippe asks her to be his wife and he introduces her to the court.

Anthony Veranis

Anthony Veranis, also known as "Mickey White" and "Tony" (June 15, 1938, Dorchester, Massachusetts – April 25, 1966 Quincy, Massachusetts) was an associate of the Winter Hill Gang and a professional welterweight boxer.
Biography.
Early life.
Veranis was born to first generation Italian immigrants Anthony Sr. and Theresa from Nuoro in Sardinia, Italy. Upon their arrival to the U.S. they settled in a lower-class neighborhood in Dorchester. His father Anthony Sr. died when he was still a child leaving his mother to raise and support him on her own. By the age of twenty seven, he had a fleeting resemblance to actor Eric Close. His mother Theresa had cried often for her troubled son Anthony during his hardships and was very close to her only son. He had been in trouble with the law before, but had successfully made comebacks each time which pleased her.
When he was young his parents would take him to the Mechanics Hall, Worcester to watch the fights, but when Anthony started his boxing career she could not bare to see her son fight, but enjoyed hearing the crowds cheering for him. Anthony would told a "Boston Herald" reporter several months before his gangland murder, "Boxing got me out of trouble - it does that for a lot of kids." Anthony had "Tony" tattooed on the fingers of one of his hands and "Luck" on the other. He stood at 5'9" and weighed during his boxing career between 148 and 195 pounds and had a badly broken nose as seen in boxing photographs c. 1957 from years of boxing, fighting in prison and on the street. He was raised a Catholic. He trained with Joe DeNucci, George W. Holden, Joseph Barboza, Rocco DiSiglio, Rico Sacramone and Edward G. Connors' younger brother James.
He attended public high school in Boston and was considered by officials in the Massachusetts correctional system to be a "persistent delinquent" when he was prepubescent to the time of a teenager. As Anthony was incarcerated in 1950 at Lyman Correctional School, he was anonymously involved in the Unwraveling Juvenile Delinquency (UJD) study conducted by Harvard University professors Sheldon Glueck and Eleanor (Touroff) Glueck, discovering the causes of juvenile delinquency and adult crime and assessing the overall effectiveness of correctional treatment in controlling criminal careers.
Boxing career.
As a teenager he was sent to the Lyman Correction School (now the Lyman School for Boys), the United States' first reform school located in Westborough, Massachusetts. While serving time there, infamous boxer and fight manager Clement Stein Jr. saw him in bouts while incarcerated, but got him enlisted in an amateur boxing league when he was released. He boxed with an orthodox stance. In 1957, at the age of eighteen he became a professional welterweight boxer. During his professional boxing career he was sponsored by the boxing equipment and sportswear company Ben Lee. Friends later said that he was quiet, polite and anxious to do well.
On December 8, 1956 he first fought against Al Pepin in Portland, Maine which was his professional boxing debut. On January 28, 1957 he impressed the audience by defeating the boxer 150-pound Gunboat Steeves in Boston, Massachusetts. On February 21, 1957, he knocked out Guy LaConte in Revere, Massachusetts. On February 27, 1957, he knocked out Don Vincent in the second round. Veranis fought against Boston native boxer Mickey Dwyer in a six round bout in Boston, Massachusetts and outscored him. On April 22, 1957, he knocked down Mark Murray in Holyoke, Massachusetts three times and defeated him. On May 16, 1957, Veranis completed in his first main event against Joe Klein and won. On June 11, 1957, he knocked down competitor Norm Gautreau in Boston in 1:55. On July 25, 1957, he fought Eddie Prince and was hard pressed to win an eight round split over Prince. On August 27, 1958, he fought against Gene Lopes, as a last minute substitute replacement in Fall River, Massachusetts and won. He later fought Gene Lopes again on September 12, 1957 and knocked him out again in the seventh round. On November 19, 1957, he fought against Roy Tiger Steele in Boston and won. During this match, Veranis was said by boxing officials to have "avenged the only blemish on his record with an easy decision." 
When boxing against Bobby Murphy on December 3, 1957, he dropped Murphy in the seventh round. Murphy rose up off the ring floor but was badly battered when referee Eddie Curley called a stop to the match. On December 17, 1957, he fought against Barry Allison, who at the time was the New England Middleweight champion. His middleweight title was not at stake though, and Anthony was disqualified. On February 13, 1958, Veranis knocked out Silby Ford for a mandatory eight count in the fifth round. He broke Ford's jaw and dislodged several teeth that sent him down. Ford was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital following Anthony's victory. On March 1, 1958, he fought for the New England Middleweight Champion title against Barry Allison whose title was up for grabs and lost. On March 17, 1958 he fought his last professional match against Joe Devlin.
Suffering from blackouts.
After boxing Gunboat Steves (he had previously boxed against him on February 28, 1957) in Holyoke, Massachusetts on March 17, 1958, he started to suffer from severe headaches. On that day, he was knocked out by Joe Devlin in every round. After the fight he passed out and was taken to Boston City Hospital where he remained in a coma until June 1958. This was his last professional boxing match. 
In September 1964 after returning to the ring and fighting Pineapple Stevenson, he blacked out while fighting, and woke up in the hospital again. During that match he had put Pineapple Stevenson in a coma. Anthony himself started to suffer from extremely bad migraines, nausea, blurry vision with the inability to focus, and temporary mood swings that changed his behavior. It is unknown if he sought professional rehabilitation at a hospital to help these symptoms that plagued him. He told to a friend, ""I thought my life was over when I couldn't fight anymore. I was filled with self pity, I started drinking again and I got into trouble."" It is also thought that not being able to box anymore caused him severe depression which brought him to start drinking heavily and becoming incapacitated with alcohol on a regular basis.
Out of 25 matches he won 15, although never was able to obtain the welterweight championship belt as it was not available to him the first time and lost it in 1958, lost two matches and was disqualified from one.
Criminal career.
He was arrested for an unidentified crime on December 23, 1963 and sent to Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Norfolk. While incarcerated at the prison was an altar boy at prison masses. Father John Fitzgerald of St. Joseph's Church in Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Norfolk later said, "He wanted to get straightened out, and I think he did. He was a wonderful boy who'd run with a bad crowd. He frequently stopped in to see me and Father Peter Hart after he got out, and everything seemed to be all right. He took me to the fights, and he was with respectable fellows." After his father suffered a heart attack and could not work, he worked on a construction crew. He became indebted to loan sharks. He was arrested for an unidentified crime on December 23, 1963 and later sent to prison.
Death and afterward.
On April 25, 1966, a month after his release from prison John Martorano beat Anthony savagely and shot him in the head. Martorano had his corpse dumped in the Blue Hills Reservation off Route 128 in Dedham, Massachusetts.

Kambi, (born September 14, 1961), better known by his stage name Killa Kambi, is an African rapper and producer, well known for his singles "Running from tha Pahlice", "Hipped Hop Sahved My Fahce" and "Shook Cuuves Vol 2".
Born in Swaziland's capital, Mbabane, Kambi left for Montreal in 1976 to pursue his aspirations as a rapper.
His work has influenced, and been admired by many, including Kanye West, Eminem, Lupe Fiasco, 50 Cent, Talib Kweli and KRS-One. His lyricism has also earned him the respect from rap pioneers such as Rakim and A Tribe Called Quest.
Early life.
Kambi, which means "helper and protector" in Sanskrit, spent the first years of his life in the McGill Ghetto section of Montreal. His father Olu Dara was a jazz trumpeter and his mother Fannie Ann Jones was a Postal Service worker. He has one sibling, a brother named Jabari who assumes the alias Jailhouse Jambi. While in Montreal, Kambi would listen to his neighbour's rap records.
Career.
Kambi had settled on pursuing a career as a rapper, and as a teenager, he enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Shamit "MC Pankaj" Kumar. Kambi first went by the nickname Kid Kambi before adopting his more commonly known alias of Kambi Kam. Despite the substantial buzz for Kambi in the underground scene, the rapper was rejected by major labels and was not signed to a recording deal. Kambi and Shamit continued to work together, but their partnership was cut short when Shamit was shot in the head and killed by a gunman in Queensbridge on May 23.

James Freney

James Freney (1719–1788) was an Irish highwayman.
Early life.
James Freney was a native of County Kilkenny, and from a respectable family who had been wealthy and powerful in the region since the 13th century, having their seat at Ballyreddy Castle. But during the 1650s they lost their lands and were reduced in status. His father, John Freney, was a servant working at the home of one Joseph Robbins at Ballyduff, Thomastown. In 1718 he married Robbins's housemaid, Alice Phelan, and their son James was born the following year at Alice's father's home at Inistioge.
He received a good education locally, including tuition in the Robbins household—and in 1742 moved to Waterford where he opened a pub with his wife Anne.
Criminal career.
Unable to pay the exorbitant fees charged by the town corporation, the couple closed up their pub and moved back to Thomastown. Here, Freney fell in with the Kellymount highway gang, led by fellow Thomastown man John Reddy. Their colleagues would in time number Richard Dooling, John Anderson, Felix Donnelly, James Bolger, Michael Millea, John Reddy, George Roberts, Edmond Kenny, James Larrassy and a man called Hackett.
Proclaimed an outlaw in January 1748 (old calendar), Freney surrendered in April 1749. Joseph Robbins's brother, a lawyer, and Lord Carrick helped Freney work out a deal with the chief justices in which Freeney would be allowed to emigrate. It is believed this deal was procured because the authorities feared executing him would make him a folk hero and lead to further disturbances.
The rest of the Kellymount were not so lucky. Bolger, Kenny, Larrassy, Millea, Reddy, Hackett, Dooling and Roberts all went to the gallows. Reddy was imprisoned while Donnelly escaped to England but was eventually hanged in Kilkenny.
Later life.
His autobiography, "The Life and Adventures of Mr James Freney", was a huge success upon its publication in 1754. Thackeray, in reading the book, delighted in Freney's "noble naïveté and simplicity of the hero as he recounts his own adventures". Thackeray includes Freney in the novel "The Luck of Barry Lyndon", where he has Barry encounter Freney on the highway. The incident appears also in the film Barry Lyndon (in the film, Barry refers to the man about to rob him as "Freney"). Local landmarks named after him include Freney's Rock and Freney's Well, and he was the hero of "The Ballad of the Bold Captain".
Death.
It is not known where or how long he was abroad, if at all, but by 1776 he had settled at the port of New Ross where he was worked as a customs official, a post he held till his death in on 20 December 1788. He was buried in Inistioge graveyard.

Australia's Stephanie Rice pulled away to a strong finish on the freestyle leg, as she claimed an Olympic gold medal in the event. She established a sterling time of 4:29.45 to slash 1.67 seconds off the world record, set by Katie Hoff from the U.S. Olympic Trials. Zimbabwe's Kirsty Coventry also went under a world record, but earned her first silver at these Games, in an African record of 4:29.89. Meanwhile, Hoff did not match her stellar performance from the trials, as she settled only for the bronze in 4:31.71.
Rising American teenager Elizabeth Beisel finished outside the medals in fourth place at 4:34.24, holding off Italy's Alessia Filippi (4:34.34) to fifth by exactly a tenth of a second (0.10). Great Britain's Hannah Miley (4:39.44), Russia's Yana Martynova (4:40.04), and China's Li Xuanxu (4:42.13) rounded out the finale.

Garrison Grist Mill Historic District

The Garrison Grist Mill Historic District is a parcel of Highlands Country Club located at the southwest corner of the intersection of NY 9D and Lower Station Road (Putnam County Route 12) in Garrison, New York, United States. It contains three buildings, including the titular gristmill (believed to be one of the oldest in the county, and a dam, all dating to the colonial era or the early years of American independence. They are interspersed within the club's golf course, and actually come under the ownership of the Open Space Institute.
Little is known about who built the structures, and when. Their architecture suggests they are among the oldest buildings in Garrison, some of the few extant examples of vernacular architecture in the hamlet. They were added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a historic district in 1992.
Geography and properties.
The district is bounded on the east by Route 9D, the north by Lower Station Road, the south by Arden Brook and the west by a dirt path that goes from Lower Station to the brook. Other NRHP-listed properties are nearby: The Birches is across 9D, the Mandeville House across Lower Station and Wilson House a short distance to the west down Lower Station, which leads to the train station and the neighboring Garrison Landing Historic District. Castle Rock is visible to the east atop a nearby mountain. The three buildings and one structure, all contributing resources, are located between the fairways of the golf course.
The most noticeable building in the district is the red frame one-and-half-story farmhouse visible from the nearby intersection. It sits on a slight slope to the nearby Hudson River. Its shingle siding was applied later over painted weatherboard. The main block retains more of its original furnishing and layout than the kitchen wing.
Five hundred feet (151 m) south of the farmhouse is a New World Dutch barn, in the traditional wood-frame style with large wagon doors at each end. It is sided in weathered clapboard. To its northwest sits the millpond, and at the other end is the gristmill, where the landscape begins to descend more steeply to the river. It is a -story building that has been converted to an apartment in part. In addition to that there have been other renovations and deterioration to the property over the years.
The last property in the district is the dam. It is made of locally quarried stone and begins east of the mill, following a natural fall line at the northwest corner of the district.
History.
There is little, if any, mention of the mill, barn or farmhouse in early histories or maps of the Garrison area. Although the architectural styles and building materials strongly suggest a mid- to late 18th century construction date, similar buildings are known to have been erected in the Hudson Valley as late as 1820. The framing system of the farmhouse is more commonly found in the lower valley, in areas closer to New York City that were settled earlier, and more study is needed, especially given the high integrity of the structure.
The earliest landowner known to have developed property in the area was Jacob Mandeville, a New York City businessman who leased in the area from Beverley Robinson in 1735 and built his still-extant home just outside the district. It is possible that he could have built the farm and mill before the Revolution, but there is no record that would prove this.
His landlord was a Virginian who had married into the Philipse family, whose vast landholdings extended from the Garrison area almost to what is today known as Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx, was like his in-laws a Loyalist during the Revolution who actively fought for the crown. The Robinson and Philipse lands were confiscated during the war, and after the colonists' victory he left for England. Mandeville was allowed to live out his life on the (now subdivided) property he had leased, and after his death in 1784 it was purchased by his son-in-law, Joshua Nelson.
Nelson further subdivided the property, and in 1792 sold the parcel including the district. From him it passed through several other owners, who appear to have continued to farm and mill. The last of these, Thomas Arden and his family, acquired the property in 1820 and continued to own it for the rest of the century. In 1899, the Ardenia Corporation, a local conservation organization took title and, shortly afterward, leased it to the newly formed Highlands Country Club for use as part of its golf course.
As Garrison became a popular area to build large riverside estates, the properties remained untouched but were also largely ignored by any historians of the area. In 1934, however, Thomas Hotchkiss, a Peekskill man working for the Historic American Buildings Survey visited what he described as the "Galloway Farmhouse", then in use as a greenskeeper's lodge, and wrote a brief report as well as taking photographs and making sketches. Hotchkiss noted the unique historicity of a group of buildings that were so old having survived the later surge of local development, and documented some features of the buildings, particularly the mill wheel's exterior gearing, that have since been lost.
In 1986 it came under the control of the Open Space Institute (OSI), as part of a parcel that became Arden Point State Park. OSI renovated the mill, and has allowed the club to continue its use as a golf course, since that preserves the original agricultural character of the surrounding land.

A native of Philadelphia, Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz graduated from Central High School of Philadelphia in 1996 and received a B.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from New York University in 2000. Her brother, Kevin Aptowicz, is a professor of Physics at West Chester University.
Poetry.
Aptowicz was introduced to the New York City Poetry Slam community by NYU classmate, Beau Sia. In November 1998, at age 19, she founded the NYC-Urbana Poetry Slam series. NYC-Urbana was the formal continuation of a poetry slam series started by Bob Holman and as of 2008, has earned three National Poetry Slam Championships: 1997 (as Team Mouth Almighty), 2000 and 2002. Aptowicz was a member of the 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2010 NYC-Urbana Poetry Slam teams. Well-known poets who have been on NYC-Urbana Poetry Slam teams including Taylor Mali, Beau Sia, Anis Mojgani and Sarah Kay, among others. Aptowicz was also the 2010 Women of the World Poetry Slam (WOWps) representative for NYC-Urbana. As of 2014, NYC-Urbana Poetry Slam is still held weekly at the New York City's Sidewalk Cafe. 
Aptowicz is the author of six books of poetry, including the recently released "The Year of No Mistakes" (Write Bloody Publishing, 2013). Aptowicz's previous book of poetry was "Everything is Everything", which Write Bloody Publishing released in January 2010. In 2011, Write Bloody Publishing also re-released Aptowicz's first four books -- "Dear Future Boyfriend" (2000), "Hot Teen Slut" (2001), "Working Class Represent" (2003) and "Oh, Terrible Youth" (2007) -- which had originally been published by the Ann Arbor basement press, The Wordsmith Press.
Aptowicz appeared in the concert film "Taylor Mali & Friends Live at the Bowery Poetry Club" and in the documentary "Slam Planet" (2006). In 2003, she served the overseas mentor for "Mouth Off!", a youth poetry show commissioned by the Sydney Opera House. She frequently tours with poets Buddy Wakefield, Derrick Brown and Anis Mojgani on their "poetry revival tours," joining them on their 2008 Junkyard Ghost Revival tour, 2009 Elephant Engine High Dive Revival tour and 2010 Night Kite Revival tour.
In November 2010, it was announced that Aptowicz had been awarded a 2011 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship for Poetry. She is one of only handful of "slam poets" who have won NEA grants. As of 2011, the other poets are Hal Sirowitz (who was on the Nuyorican Poets Cafe Poetry Slam team in 1993, and won an NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 1994); Jeffrey McDaniel (who was on numerous DC and California slam teams in the mid to late 1990s, and won a NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 2003); and Adrienne Su (who was on the Nuyorican Poets Cafe Poetry Slam team in 1991, and won a NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 2007).
In February 2012, it was announced that Aptowicz had been awarded the 2013 Amy Clampitt Residency. The residency takes place in the former residence of poet Amy Clampitt and provides "an established or emerging poet or literary scholar with the rare gift of extended time and a reasonable stipend so that he or she may substantially further his or her creative work." Aptowicz is the first poet from a poetry slam background to be awarded this residency.
Non-fiction.
Aptowicz has published non-fiction essays and articles in such publications as Bust magazine, About.com's Poetry Channel and the spoken word anthology "Word Warriors".
In 2008, Soft Skull Press published Aptowicz's "Words In Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam." U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins wrote that the book "leaves no doubt that the slam poetry scene has achieved legitimacy and taken its rightful place on the map of contemporary literature" and the Washington Post named it one of five Notable Books on Exploring Poetry in 2008. Aptowicz spent 4 years writing the book, which "explores the birth, growing pains and continuing development of the Poetry Slam." The book features interviews with Saul Williams, Maggie Estep, Bob Holman and Slamnation director Paul Devlin, among others.
Aptowicz also penned the non-fiction screenplay, "Mütter", a screenplay based on the life of Mütter Museum founder Thomas Dent Mütter. The screenplay would go on to win the 2003 "Set In Philadelphia" Screenwriting Award at the Philadelphia Film Festival and a Sloan Foundation Fellowship at the 2004 Hampton International Film Festival. In 2005, she was invited to attend the 2005 Sloan Film Summit in support of the screenplay, and was commissioned to write an article about her experiences at the Summit by New York City's Museum of the Moving Image. As of 2008, the screenplay remains unproduced, although a short based on the feature-length script was created as a part of the Philadelphia Film Festival prize package.
In 2010, Aptowicz was named the 2010-2011 University of Pennsylvania ArtsEdge Writer-in-Residence. She will be using the residency to work on "a non-fiction book about the life and times of Thomas Dent Mutter." The Mütter Museum has granted Aptowicz full access to their museum, library and archives for the duration of the residency so that she may conduct her research for the book, and the Mütter Museum's Francis C. Wood Institute for the History of Medicine has additionally awarded Aptowicz with a Wood Institute Travel Grant to help further fund and support her work on this project.
In April 2013, it was announced that Aptowicz's biography of Mütter, titled "Curiosity", will be published in Fall 2014 by the Gotham Books division of Penguin.

XCOM Data Transport

XCOM, is a proprietary file transfer utility owned by CA Technologies. First launched in 1987, it became one of the first heterogeneous systems management software products to be widely deployed in large corporate networks around the world, at peak expanding to more than 13 operating systems, and is still being sold and deployed more than 25 years later. Its installed based grew very rapidly at first because it was one of the first third party products to be based upon the then advanced networking technology from IBM, known as Advanced Program to Program Communication, which allowed faster and more reliable communication between different types of computers. Originally developed by Spectrum Concepts (in conjunction with Proginet), the product was sold to Legent Corporation in 1992, in the largest software transaction in history, up until that time, in a transaction that acquired approval of the United States Department of Justice 
Its early versions supported IBM mainframe and midrange including IBM System 38 and AS/400, Windows, Apple, UNIX, Digital Equipment Corporation VAX, Data General, Stratus, Tandem, and others, for many decades and functions on both SNA and TCP/IP networks. XCOM establishes a peer-to-peer connection to manage all aspects of moving bulk data between heterogeneous systems. 
History.
Spectrum Concepts Inc. of New York City, which was primarily a software consulting firm, originally developed XCOM 6.2 in the mid-1980s, in conjunction with Proginet, and sold it as a product on many platforms. In 1992 Spectrum Concepts Inc. merged with Legent Inc. which in turn was bought by Computer Associates in 1995.
Current use.
XCOM is popular in industries dominated by mainframes such as banking, insurance and telecommunications, but increasingly more in the distributed environments for large installations, Government Departments and companies that have to meet the current crop of Privay Regulations, across the Globe.

Belgium–Canada relations

Belgium–Canada relations are those between the nations of Belgium and Canada. Both are close allies and members of NATO and Francophonie. Both have a stance of multilateralism and both have similar government systems. Both are actively involved in the current war in Afghanistan under ISAF.
Missions.
Belgium has an embassy in Ottawa, two consulates (in Montreal and Toronto), and four honorary consulates (in Edmonton, Halifax, Vancouver and Winnipeg) located in Canada. Belgium's three regions (Wallonia, Flanders and Brussels) each have their own offices in the Montreal consulate. Wallonia also has a second office in the Toronto consulate, which also represents Flanders and Brussels.
Canada maintains an embassy in Brussels (which also covers Luxembourg). Canada also has a consulate in Antwerp, and Quebec maintains its own separate delegation in Brussels. The Canadian delegations to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are located in Belgium, as Belgium houses the headquarters of each. Luxembourg is often dealt with in tandem to Belgium.
Belgium and Canada are member states of a variety of international organizations. They include: the United Nations, NATO, La Francophonie, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Trade.
Bilateral investment in 2006 was $5.9 billion. Luxembourg included, the total rises to $8.4 billion. Belgium exported a total $2.35 billion in 2006 in goods. Belgian exports include fuels, diamonds and mineral oils, vehicles, machinery and pharmaceutical products. The same year Canada exported $2.84 billion in goods. Canadian exports include diamonds, nickel, machinery, oil and zinc. Belgium was Canada's 5th biggest export destination within the EU during that year. Antwerp is one of the main ports of entry for Canadian goods to the EU.
Belgian and Canadian universities have many partnerships. More than 20 Canadian universities partner with their Belgian counterparts in an array of fields ranging from health to social sciences.
History.
A few Belgians came to New France before 1759. In the mid-19th century there were enough arrivals to open part-time consulates in Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax. After 1859 the main attraction was free farm land. After 1867 the national government gave immigrants from Belgium a preferred status, and encouraged emigration to the Francophone Catholic communities of Quebec and Manitoba. Edouard Simaeys became a part-time paid Canadian agent in Belgium to publicize opportunities in Canada and facilitate immigration. The steamship companies prepared their own brochures and offered inexpensive package deals to farm families. By 1898 there was a full-time Canadian office in Antwerp which provided pamphlets, lectures and specific travel advice. By 1906 some 2000 Belgians a year were arriving, most with skills in agriculture. A third wave of immigration took place after 1945, with urban areas the destination. The 1961 census counted 61,000 Canadians of Belgian ancestry. 
Belgian immigration to western Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century attracted the attention of the Belgian government. It enacted laws and regulations to protect the emigrants and guarantee adequate shipboard conditions. Provision was made to assist emigrants who decided to return to Belgium. Starting in the 1860s consular officials made on-site visits to inspect conditions in Canada, which eagerly welcomed the new arrivals. The Catholic Church was likewise welcoming, and a number of priests immigrated. The Walloon immigrants discovered they could continue to speak French in Canada, while the Flemish quickly learned English. The Belgians formed no national organization on their behalf. Some settled in towns such as St. Boniface, Manitoba, but most became farmers who specialized in dairy farming, sugar beets and market gardening. After 1920 there was a move to western Alberta, with en economy based on ranching, horse breeding, and sugar beets.

Haynesville Shale

The Haynesville Shale is an informal, popular name for a rock formation that underlies large parts of southwestern Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and East Texas. It lies at depths of 10,500 to 13,000 feet below the land’s surface. It is part of a large rock formation, which is known by geologists as the Haynesville Formation. The Haynesville Shale underlies an area of about 9,000 square miles and averages about 200 to 300 feet thick. The Haynesville Shale is overlain by sandstone of the Cotton Valley Group and underlain by limestone of the Smackover Formation.
It contains vast quantities of recoverable natural gas. This natural gas is known as "shale gas" because the wells produce from low permeability mudstones that are also the source for the natural gas. It was known to contain large quantities of natural gas prior to 2008. However, prior to that time, it was uneconomic to extract the natural gas. As a result of rising gas prices and improved technology in hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling, it became possible to extract the gas from the Haynesville Shale in an economic and cost-effective manner.
Source of name.
The Haynesville Formation, from which the Haynesville Shale gets its name, was named after the town of Haynesville, Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. The type location for Haynesville Formation, is the Hunt Oil Company No. 1 well in Haynesville oil field, sec. 3, T. 23 N., R. 7 W., Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. In many geological reports and journal papers, the Hayesville Shale was classified as part of the Bossier Shale, although they are now classified as separate formations.
Lithology of Haynesville Shale.
The Haynesville Shale is a lithologically heterogeneous, often organic-rich, mudstone. The composition of these mudstones varies greatly depending on position on geographic location and stratigraphic position. They vary from calcareous mudstone near the carbonate platforms and islands to argillaceous mudstone in areas where submarine fans prograded into the basin and diluted organic matter For example, the Haynesville Shale has been observed to vary in composition from 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent calcite in samples recovered from one oil and gas well. In that well, the Haynesville Shale consists of silty, argillaceous mudstones, silty, calcareous mudstones, and dolomitic mudstones and dolostones. The silty, argillaceous mudstones contain more than 30% silt-sized siliceous grains. The silt often occurs as laminations within these mudstones. In addition, the argillaceous matrix of such mudstones frequently contains numerous calcareous particles and stringers. The calcareous particles include coccoliths, bivalve, and gastropod fragments, and calcispheres. Organic matter in the form of amorphous kerogen coats the argillaceous material. Silty, calcareous mudstones contain more than 20% calcite. In these mudstones, the calcite occurs as silt-sized microfossil hash composed of fragmented fossils and carbonate mud. Where organic matter is low and silts are rare, the calcareous microfossil and carbonate mud has recrystallized. Possibly, further alteration of silty, calcareous mudstones has resulted in the formation of the dolomitic mudstones and dolostones. Both the silty, argillaceous mudstones and silty, calcareous mudstones often exhibit sparse to abundant, laminated pelletal fabrics.
The Haynesville Formation consists of marine and coastal plain limestone, shale, mudstone, and sandstone. In addition to the Haynesville Shale, the Haynesville Formation contains two formal subdivisions, which geologists call members. They are the Gilmer Limestone, also informally known as the Cotton Valley Limestone, and Buckner Anhydrite members. The Gilmer Limestone and Buckner Anhydrite members represent coastal and shallow marine deposits, which form along northern boundary of the basin in which the Haynesville Shale accumulated and separate it from contemporaneous undifferentiated nonmarine deposits that occur beneath Arkansas further north. In addition, the Gilmer Limestone member also represents a carbonate platform with oolite shoals that lie beneath central Upshur and western Smith counties, Texas. They comprise the western boundary of the ancient shelf basin within which Haynesville Shale accumulated. A third, informal member, which called the "Gray sandstone," of the Haynesville Formation interfingers with Haynesville Shale along its northern edge. This sandstone is regarded as having accumulated as submarine fans carrying sediment from the coastline into the basin within which the Haynesville Shale accumulated.
Fossils and age.
Very limited detailed descriptions of the Haynesville Shale indicated that it is fossiliferous. The reported fossils include unidentified coccoliths, bivalves, gastropods, and calcispheres. Both stratigraphic relationships and a nannofossil (coccolith) assemblage described from it indicates that it is Kimmeridgian, 151 to 157 million years old, in age.
Depositional Environment.
The Haynesville Shale was deposited in a restricted basin that was located on a southward sloping continental shelf covered by relatively shallow water. The mudstone comprising it accumulated as a widespread and laterally continuous blanket across the limits of this restricted basin. The accumulation of pelleted, fossiliferous, organic-rich carbonate mud and even and wavy-lenticular laminated beds of very fine quartz silt and detrital clay reflects the mixed accumulation of carbonate sediments generated within this basin and clastic sediments that came from outside it. The northern edge of this basin consisted of shallow coastal waters floored by carbonate muds and oolite shoals lying just north of the modern Louisiana - Arkansas border. The shallow coastal waters were bordered further north by an arid coastal plain characterized by extensive sabkas. The western edge of the basin in which the Haynesville Shale accumulated consisted of a broad north-south carbonate platform with prominent oolite shoals. The southern rim of this ancient basin and extent of the Haynesville Shale was an ancient Jurassic island, called "Sabine Island. This ancient island now lies deeply buried beneath the surface of Sabine County, Texas.
The carbonate platforms, their oolite shoals, the Sabine Island, and prehistoric Gulf of Mexico coastline created a restricted basin that marine currents could only readily access from the east. As a result of these restrictive conditions, anoxic conditions frequently occurred during the deposition of the sediments that form the Haynesville Shale. Anoxic bottom water conditions allowed organic matter falling to the floor of this basin to be preserved and incorporated into sediments that became the Haynesville Shale. The mechanisms by which organic matter accumulated within these sediments consisted of a complex interplay of local carbonate generation, clastic input from outside sources, variable burial rates, and variable bottom water anoxia and euxinia.
Natural gas.
The Haynesville Shale came into prominence in 2008 as a major producer of shale gas in East Texas and Louisiana. Producing natural gas from the Haynesville Shale involves drilling wells from and to deep; the formation becomes deeper to the south. 
In 2008, the Haynesville Shale was thought to be the largest natural gas field in the contiguous 48 states with an estimated 250 trillion cubic feet (7.1×1012 m3) of recoverable gas. More recently, as of 2009, the Haynesville was estimated to have 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, second only to the Marcellus Formation in the US. Some scientists estimated recoverable reserves average of 6.5 billion cubic feet per well. The US Energy Information Administration estimated that the average well would produce 2.67 billion cubic feet of gas.
Production has boomed since 2008, creating a number of new millionaires in the Shreveport, Louisiana region. Haynesville gas production peaked at 7.2 billion cubic feet per day in November 2011. In January 2013 the formation produced 6.2 billion cubic feet per day, 9.3% of all the gas produced in the US.
The other members of the Haynesville Formation are also the source of oil and gas production. Oil and gas is currently produced from shelf-edge carbonate reservoirs which consist of oolite shoals within the Gilmer Limestone and Buckner Anhydrite members. The submarine fan sandstones of the Gray sand in north Louisiana are also significant producers.
Documentary film.
A documentary film entitled "Haynesville: A Nation's Hunt for an Energy Future" has been made on the subject of the mineral rights leasing "gold rush" and the potential impact of the Haynesville Shale gas play on national and global energy picture. The filmmaker, Gregory Kallenberg, has close ties to the oil and gas industry and his film is being promoted heavily by a group called The Rational Middle. The Rational Middle is funded by Shell Oil, according to the group's own website.
Mineral Owner Collaboration.
Not long after the land-leasing boom began in 2008, new mineral owners across northwest Louisiana and East Texas joined online forums and began sharing information with each other about the process of oil and gas leasing, leasing bonus payments and well production results. GoHaynesvilleShale.com was the first and largest of its kind with over 20,000 members.

Avery August

Avery August, Scientist and Professor of Immunology at Cornell University, was born in Belize City, Belize.
Education.
Avery August attended government primary schools, and subsequently attended St. Michael's College for Boys (as High Schools in Belize are called), where he earned a High School Diploma. Following one year at the Belize Technical College, he emigrated with his family to Los Angeles, California. There he attended California State University, Los Angeles, where he earned a B.S. degree in Medical Technology. While at California State University, he got involved in undergraduate research in the laboratory of Dr. Phoebe Dea, then Professor of Chemistry & Biochemistry at California State University (see Scientific Career below for details). This first exposure to research pushed him to attend graduate school at Cornell University's Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences in New York City. There he worked at the Sloan Kettering Institute (an Institute within the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) with Immunologist Dr. Bo Dupont, and where he earned PhD degree in Immunology. He then gained post-doctoral experience at The Rockefeller University, working with renowned virologist and National Academy of Science member, Dr. Hidesaburo Hanafusa.
Scientific career.
Avery August first worked in the catalytic synthesis of fatty acids and other lipids as an undergraduate student in Prof. Dea's laboratory at The California State University at Los Angeles. This work resulted in the publication on methods to easily catalyze the insertion of deuterium into unsaturated fatty acids, which could then be used as probes of membrane structure.
Upon moving to Cornell University, Dr. August initiated work on his PhD thesis, to understand the molecular basis of activation of T cells. T cells are major players in regulating the development of an immune response. The importance of these cells is illustrated by the fact that the virus HIV infects helper T cells, and thus disables effective immunity against the virus, resulting in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS.
At Cornell, Dr. August worked with Dr. Bo Dupont, working on unraveling the molecular basis for T cell costimulation by the cell surface protein CD28. This work resulted in 9 publications (see references at PubMed). This work also led to the production of his PhD thesis entitled "On the molecular basis of the two signal hypothesis of T cell activation: Signaling by CD3 and CD28".
Following graduation, Dr. August joined the Laboratory of Molecular Oncology at The Rockefeller University, headed by Dr. Hidesaburo Hanafusa. At The Rockefeller, Dr. August worked on a number of areas, including analysis of the BRCA1 oncogene that when mutated, results in much increased risk for breast cancer. This work was the first to show that this protein could regulate the transcription of genes and could potentially regulate the development of Breast cancer in this fashion. He also continued working on analysis of the regulation of Tec family kinases, work which he had started as a PhD student and was the first to show that this family of kinases are regulated by upstream signals from Src and PI3-kinase. This work had direct implications for manipulating T cell activation and thus the immune response.

It was one of OKC's first black formatted stations for many years. The tower, before moving to Britton Rd. and Eastern was located on the same property as Remington Park at approx. 55th and N. Eastern. The studio was located at 9th and Broadway downtown, where the Murrah Bombing site is now. Ownership for many years was by the Lynch brothers. Under Tyler ownership, the station was then known as KKNG beginning 1999-09-17. On 2000-08-30, the station changed its call sign to the current KTLR.

John B. Whealton Memorial Causeway

The John B. Whealton Memorial Causeway, more commonly known to the locals as the Chincoteague Causeway, connects the mainland of the Eastern Shore to Chincoteague, where it continues into town as Maddox Boulevard. The causeway is part of Virginia State Route 175 (Chincoteague Road). The causeway contains five bridges and crosses the following (west to east):
The original causeway contained six bridges. The route crossed the Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel via separate bridges which took the causeway across Marsh Island, landing in town between Mumford and Cleveland Streets. The former a fixed bridge, the latter a swing bridge, they were both removed in late 2010 after the construction of the new bridge. The Marsh Island Connector is a short spur bridge connecting the Marsh Island community to the new bridge. The spur joins the main bridge at a T-intersection over the water, and is a rare example of a three-way bridge.
History.
The original plan for a causeway to link Chincoteague to the mainland was proposed by John B. Whealton, who formed the Chincoteague Toll Road and Bridge Company in 1919. The route originally proposed ran from Wallops Neck to the south end of Chincoteague, but was changed to bring the bridge to the center of town. An application for permission to the Virginia General Assembly was approved on September 14, 1919. Bids for the project were opened as soon as the news was telegraphed to Chincoteague. Whealton's bid for $144,000 was the lowest. The project was completed on November 15, 1922.
An opening ceremony was attended by 4000 people and featured an address by Virginia Governor Harry F. Byrd. Rain started to fall during the ceremony, and when the attendees started to leave the causeway became impassable, with 96 cars stuck. Boats were called to rescue the stranded, and barges ended up taking the cars to the mainland. Whealton undertook repairs, increasing the portion of shell in the dredged sand-and-oyster-shell surface and completing repairs by Christmas of 1922.
Tolls were suspended on the causeway in 1930. The causeway's bridges were rebuilt in the late 1930s, with the Black Narrows fixed bridge and the Chincoteague Channel swing bridge dating to 1939 and 1940, respectively.
A new bridge was built by the Virginia Department of Transportation to replace the deteriorated Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel bridges, completed in late 2010. The new bridge veers to the north just to the west of Black Narrows, suspended completely over open water and curving eastward just to the north of Marsh Island. The bridge crosses Lewis Creek Channel, north of Chincoteague Channel, via drawbridge and descends to meet grade at the intersection of Maddox Boulevard and Main Street, about 1/2 mile to the north of the old Chincoteague Channel Swing Bridge landing. Just to the north of Black Narrows is a T-intersection for a spur bridge to the small community on Marsh Island, as the Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel bridges that cross the island were removed shortly after the opening of the new bridge.

The over king of Leinster Fínsnechta Cethardec mac Cellaig (died 808) was working to ensure his control of the church of Kildare which led to conflict with the Uí Failge. His predecessor Óengus mac Mugróin (died 803) had been assassinated by the orders of Finsnechta and in 806, Flaíthnia was himself assassinated at his royal fort at Ráith Imgáin (Rathangan, County Kildare). This was probably also the work of Finsnechta.

"Visions of Paradise" is a 1968 song by the progressive rock band The Moody Blues. First released on their album "In Search of the Lost Chord", it was written jointly by band members Justin Hayward and Ray Thomas, and was the first of many collaborations between them. The song is primarily led by Justin Hayward's voice and Ray Thomas's flute, and the lyrics deeply describe the author's perception of paradise.
The song has been described as ".. little else than Thomas’s flute riff and Hayward’s softly picked acoustic. Apparently resuming the drug-trip theme, this song may be even further "out there" than "The Best Way to Travel" with a surreal perception of paradise."

On the outside, Fina and Rodel's marriage is a match made in heaven; but behind the thick walls of what they call home, their relationship is on the verge of crumbling. For all their affluence, the couple's lives remains empty. Devoid of a child to call their own, any attempts they make to conceive may prove fatal to Fina (Vilma Santos) due to her medical condition. In an act of desperation, Rodel (Edu Manzano) takes matters into his own hands and seeks the services of a surrogate, Ditas. The plan goes awry when Rodel becomes genuinely attracted to the younger and more alluring Ditas (Dina Bonnevie); while Ditas, whose lived a destitute life, finds the notion of prosperity equally irresistible. The well-intentioned plan to resuscitate life back into a dying marriage may become its undoing.

List of Shotokan organizations

This is a list of some of the larger Shotokan karate organizations.
Japan Karate Association (JKA), and descendents.
The Japan Karate Association (JKA; "Nihon Karate Kyokai" in Japan) was formed in 1949 by several of Gichin Funakoshi's senior students. The highest rank that Master Funakoshi awarded to his students was 5th Dan (5th degree black belt). JKA raised the highest rank from 5th Dan to 10th Dan with less strict requirements to obtain each rank. Takushoku University provided the most members initially, but Hosei, Waseda, Gakushuin, and Keio Universities also contributed members. Masatoshi Nakayama (1913–1987) led the JKA, with Gichin Funakoshi holding a position equivalent to Professor Emeritus. The JKA grew to be one of the biggest karate organizations in the world. Differences between senior instructors and administrators gave rise to several breakaway groups, with the JKA itself eventually dividing into two factions. Nobuyuki Nakahara, Ueki Masaaki, Tanaka Masahiko, Yoshiharu Osaka and others led one faction (Nakahara Faction), while Matsuno Raizo, Asai Tetsuhiko, Abe Keigo and Yahara Mikio led the other (Matsuno Faction). Following legal battles, the Nakahara group retained control of the JKA. The following sections describe some of the Shotokan organizations that descended from the JKA. The founders of these organizations are some of the most senior Shotokan instructors in the world.
International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF).
Hidetaka Nishiyama (1928–2008) began his karate training in 1943 under Gichin Funakoshi. Two years later, while enrolled at Takushoku University, he became a member of the university's karate team, and in 1949 its captain. He was a co-founder of the All Japan Collegiate Karate Federation and was elected as its first chairman. In 1951, Nishiyama became a founding member of the JKA, and was elected to the JKA Board of Directors. In 1952, he was selected as a member of the martial arts combat instruction staff for the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) Combat Training Program, which also included as instructors Funakoshi, Nakayama, and Isao Obata. Nishiyama came to the United States in 1961, on the invitation of SAC students and JKA members residing in the country, and four months later founded the American Amateur Karate Federation (AAKF), as a branch of the JKA. In 1968, Nishiyama organized the first World Invitational Karate Tournament held in Los Angeles. Following disagreements over organization during the 1st (1970) and 2nd (1973) World Karate Championships, the International Amateur Karate Federation (IAKF) was formed in 1974, with Nishiyama as executive director. In 1985, the IAKF changed its name to the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). Nishiyama obtained the 10th "dan" in 2003 from the International San Ten Karate Association. He died on November 7, 2008. His former students include Hiroshi Shirai and Takeshi Oishi and James Yabe.
Shotokan Karate-Do International Federation (SKIF).
Hirokazu Kanazawa (1931–), 10th "Dan", broke away from the JKA in 1978, and called his organization "Shotokan Karate-do International Federation" (SKIF). Kanazawa had studied under Masatoshi Nakayama and Hidetaka Nishiyama, both students of Gichin Funakoshi. SKIF introduced elements of T'ai chi ch'uan, particularly in the matter of flow and balance, and actively promoted the evolution of Shotokan while maintaining the traditional core of the art. Kanazawa is considered one of the most technically brilliant Shotokan exponents, and was a top contender in competition. Most notably, he won the "kumite" championship at the first JKA Open Tournament (1957) with a broken hand. Kanazawa was awarded 10th "Dan" in 2000.
International Shotokan Karate Federation (ISKF).
Teruyuki Okazaki (1931–), 10th "dan", leads the International Shotokan Karate Federation (ISKF), which is the largest Shotokan karate organization in North America South America and the Caribbean. Okazaki studied under Gichin Funakoshi and Masatoshi Nakayama, and was integral in the founding of the JKA Instructor Trainee program. As part of an effort by Nakayama to spread Shotokan karate internationally, Okazaki came to the USA in 1961. Okazaki founded the ISKF in 1977 and it was part of the JKA until June 2007.
Japan Karate Shotorenmei (JKS).
Tetsuhiko Asai (1935–2006), 10th "dan", often practiced Sumo, Judo, Kendo, and the Spear in his youth. Asai studied at the Takushoku University in Tokyo, where he also studied Shotokan karate. He joined the instructors' program and became a JKA instructor. In later years, Asai instructed in China, Hong Kong, America, Europe, and Hawaii (where he led the Hawaiian Karate Association). Asai was made Chief Instructor of the JKA after Masatoshi Nakayama's death in 1987; however, he—along with a number of other senior JKA instructors—opposed the appointment of Nakahara as Chairman, and so formed a separate JKA (Matsuno Section). Following a lengthy legal battle, the Nakahara group won the rights to the JKA title and Asai's group adopted the name of the Japan Karate Shotorenmei (JKS).
Japan Shotokan Karate Association (JSKA).
Keigo Abe (1938–), as a student at the JKA "Honbu", learned directly from Nakayama, which is reflected in his deference to Nakayama as being his only headmaster. Abe was a former senior instructor at the JKA "Honbu", having graduated from the instructors' program. He held the office of Director of Qualifications in the original, pre-split JKA. However after the split in 1990, he became the Technical Director of the JKA (Matsuno Section), during some of the association's most turbulent years. In his youth, Abe took 3rd place in the very first JKA National Championships; was the captain of the Japanese team at the second World Championships in Paris, France; won 1st place at the JKA International Friendship Tournament (1973); and took 1st place in the second and third JKF National Championships as a representative of Tokyo. Renowned for his strong traditional approach to Shotokan karate, he retired from the JKA in 1999 to form his own international organisation—the Japan Shotokan Karate Association (JSKA). Abe was also responsible for formulating the Shobu Ippon tournament rules, which are used by most Shotokan stylists today. Two of the senior instructors supporting Abe in the JSKA are Matsuru Nagaki 8th dan, Assistant Chief Instructor, father of Shinji Nagaki, both currently teaching with the Japan Karate Shotorenmei (JKS), and Makoto Matsunami 8th dan, who also runs his own independent dojo in Japan, as Technical Director. Keigo Abe was awarded 9th dan in 2008 by the JSKA Shihankai.
Karatenomichi World Federation (KWF).
Mikio Yahara (1947–), 8th "dan", is Chief Instructor of the Karatenomichi World Federation (KWF). Yahara graduated from Kokushikan University and became a JKA instructor during that organization's zenith in the 1970s and 1980s. In over a decade of competition, Yahara distinguished himself as a predatory fighter, monopolizing the high ranks of domestic and international championships. As a Kata World Cup Champion, he is probably most famous for his performance of the Unsu and Empi kata. He is known for single-handly defeating 34 local gangsters ("yakuza"), facing down a gangster with a gun, and turning up for a competition with a knife wound. When Tetsuhiko Asai, Keigo Abe, Yahara, Akihito Isaka and other leading JKA Karateka formed the Matsuno Section of the JKA, Yahara became Assistant Chief Instructor. In 2000, Yahara formed the Karatenomichi World Federation with Isaka and which is represented in over 40 countries. Yahara fractured three of his opponent's ribs during his 8th "dan" promotion kumite in July 2006. The KWF claims that no other senior karate instructor has ever submitted himself to real kumite, in front of juniors and in front of the camera, for his 8th "dan". In April 2007, Yahara and Japanese industrial loan magnate Kenshin Oshima, who is also a personal pupil of Yahara officially opened the ShotoKan, ￥1 billion private members' dojo donated to the KWF by Oshima.
World Shotokan Karate-Do Federation (WSKF).
The World Shotokan Karate-Do Federation (W.S.K.F) has members in 75 countries. It was founded in 1990 by Hitoshi Kasuya Sensei (8. Dan) and Takeaki Kamiyanagi Sensei (9. Dan) and is a global organisation with an experienced chief instructor.
Kasuya Sensei finished the JKA (Japan Karate Association) instructor course in 1973. He was a student of Nakayama Sensei, who had an important impact on him because of his scientific approach to karate and his ability to challenge his students.
Kasuya Sensei was a member of Japan's national team until 1982, participating first in IAKF and then in WUKO (World Union of Karate-do Organizations) world championships. In 1983 and 1985 he became SKIF (Shotokan Karate-Do International Federation) world champion in kata, respectively kumite. Until 1987, he participated in tournaments, and was also active as instructor. At present he is active as an instructor and referee.
Asai Shotokan Association International (ASAI).
Kousaku Yokota (1947- ), 8th "dan" is the Chief Instructor to the Asai Shotokan Association International, which has dojo in membership world-wide. He is a graduate of the Japan Karate Association's (JKA) instructors course and a personal student of the late Jun Sugano 9th dan, former JKA Vice Chairman. During his time with the JKA, Yokota also acted as an assistant instructor under Teruyuki Okazaki 10th dan at the International Shotokan Karate Federation's (ISKF) honbu dojo in Philadelphia, USA.
Yokota, resigned from the JKA and joined Tetsuhiko Asai 10th Dan and the Japan Karate Shotorenmei (JKS) as a JKS instructor, becoming an ardent student of Asai and in his latter years, a confidant. He resigned from the JKS after Asai's passing and took up the position of Technical Director of the World Japan Karate Alliance/Association (WJKA)
He left the WJKA in 2013 to form the Asai Shotokan Association International (ASAI) both to honour his own teacher; Tetsuhiko Asai, as well as offering him a vehicle by which he could better promalgate Asai's teachings world-wide (Asai-Ryu).
Asai-Ryu builds on the teachings of Funakoshi/Nakayama-ryu Shotokan karate but has added into the system, techniques which combine the strong, long distance fighting method of traditional JKA Shotokan with that of the softer and more fluid short distance fighting style of White Crane Kung fu. Asai believed that adding these techniques into traditional Shotokan training, along with the adjunctive kata of what is now known as Asai-ryu, helped cover the elements he believed were missing within the JKA system.
Yokota began his study of the martial arts in 1960 at the age of 13 when he joined the Judo club at the Hyogo Prefecture Police station. After watching it being practiced, he switched his martial arts training to karate and in 1964 he joined the JKA dojo in Kobe, Japan. He has also studied other karate and adjunctive styles such as Goju-Ryu and Kyokushinkai and Ki. His Kobudo weapons experience includes Nunchaku and Sai, which he trains with regularly to augment his karate training.
As a karateka, Yakota believes strongly in the budo/bujutsu concept of the art and therefore does not like the competition aspect that some karate-ka prefer. He has however, participated in tournaments at the behest of his instructors of the day and was champion of Hyogo Prefecture Championship in 1981 and 1982, and represented Hyogo prefecture at the JKA All Japan Championships in Tokyo. During his tournament career he fought against other Shotokan notables such as Masahiko Tanaka, Masao Kagawa and Yoshiharu Osaka. In order to better test his own karate skills and training further, he also trained for, and participated in full contact Kyokoshinkai competitions, which he feels helped validate his belief in the budo/bujutsi aspects of the art and led him to follow the teachings of Tetsuhiko Asai.
Kousaku Yokotoa who holds a post graduate masters degree, is the author of; Shotokan Myths and Shotokan Mysteries and co-author and translator of the Asai Kata Kyohon books 1,2 and 3.
International Karate Daigaku (IKD).
Frank Woon-a-tai (1950–), 9th dan, born in Guyana, and began training in 1964. He holds a B.A degree in Japanese Studies and History from the University of Toronto. A graduate of the JKA/ISKF Instructors course, he resigned from the ISKF In January 2011 where he held the positions of Chairman and Technical Director of ISKF Canada, and co-vice Chairman of the ISKF Technical Committee. He went on to establish the International Karate Daigaku (IKD); an organization of over 150 dojo(s) in 20 countries, in February 2011. The IKD currently operates in: North America, The Caribbean, South America, Europe and Asia, and is growing rapidly to the rest of the world.
Master Woon-A-Tai is Kancho (Founder) and Shuseki Shihan (Chief Instructor) of the IKD. Throughout his distinguished career, he served as first president of the Caribbean Karate College and as chief instructor of Jamaica from 1976 to 1980. He is a founder and chief instructor of JKA/ISKF Guyana, and the Guyana Karate College. He founded the Toronto JKA in 1981, and is presently Chairman and Chief Instructor of the Toronto Karate Daigaku, Ontario Karate College, IKD Ontario and IKD Canada.
World JKA Karate Association (WJKA).
The WJKA has no direct or indirect link or affiliation with the Japan Karate Association (JKA) or the Japan Karate Association World Federation (JKA/WF) or any other Japanese led Shotokan group either inside or outside Japan. It is a stand alone western organisation run by senior western Shotokan instructors headed by Mr Jan Knobel 8th Dan.
The aim of the World JKA Karate Association (started in 2000 as Alliance) is to propagate pure JKA Shotokan karate steeped in the teachings and traditional methodology of the Japan Karate Association of the 1960s through to the early 1980s, prior to the death of Masatoshi Nakayama, and as outlined in the Best Karate Series.
The concept of the WJKA was first put to an international board in 1994 in Brussels, by Sidoli Sensei and Knobel Sensei at the 2nd JKA Euro-Camp in 1996. The reasoning for this was the fact that both felt that karate-ka from both sides of the JKA (as prior to political divisions) should be able to train together and test together.
They proposed that a neutral and non-political 'friendship society' of JKA karate-ka should be created, where no individual association should be in control of any other, allowing autonomy and the freedom to fully develop. Between 1997 and 1999 there were several discussions between the European instructors. 
At the conclusion of these discussions all seemed keen to try and alma gate in friendship.The concept was not to create yet another JKA body, but to create a 'union' where everyone was in communication, affording everyone access to instruction, regardless of which association an instructor.
A meeting was held in Germany in May 2000 between students of Mikami Sensei, Yahara Sensei, Asai Sensei and Ochi Sensei. All agreed on the need for such an organization in order that JKA karate could still be enjoyed by all, rather than one association being in total control of the mantle of JKA style karate.
At the 12th (Asai faction) JKA World Karate Championships, held in Cardiff in July 2000, discussions took place between high grade non Japanese instructors.
All agreed with the need to begin the international friendship, and to draw from the experiences of senior karate-ka from around the globe and at this point the WJKA was born.
In 2007 the WJKA came at its turning point. Sidoli sensei resigned and Jan Knobel, today's president, started to run the WJKA alone.In the same year Master Kousaku Yokota joined the WJKA as Technical Director, a position he held until his resignation in 2013 when he left to form Asai Shotokan Association International (ASAI).
The WJKA changed its name from Alliance into Association with a Shihankai as board. Today the Shihankai exists of 6 senior instructors namely, Jan Knobel 8th dan President, Don Owens 8th dan, Serge Trappeniers 7th dan, Kevin Thurlow 7th dan, Tadeusz Lebida 7th Dan and John Turnbull 7th dan.
Today WJKA teaches both JKA directions, Nakayama ryu and Asai ryu.
Indian Federation Of Shotokan Karate (IFSK).
The Indian Federation of Shotokan Karate (IFSK) was established in 1990 with its head quarters in Kolkata. Apart from holding regular seminars and courses on Traditional Shotokan Karate by top Indian and foreign instructors, the IFSK also encourage its members to attend tournaments, both under traditional and sports Karate rules.

In principle IFSK practice and promote the JKA style of Shotokan, incorporating the scientific principles of Traditional Karate as taught by Hidetaka Nishiyama.
Shotokai.
The name "Shotokai" (see main article, Shōtōkai) is used as a synonym for the Shotokan ryu association "Dai Nihon Karate-do Shotokai". It is the Shotokan Karate association established by Gichin Funakoshi originally in 1930. Shotokai association is the keeper of master Funakoshi's Karate-do heritage.
Sometimes "Shotokai" is considered to be the method of karate taught by Shigeru Egami (1912–1981). Egami was the chief instructor of "Shotokan Dojo" 1976-1981. Egami began training under Funakoshi in 1930, upon entering Waseda University, and helped to establish that university's karate club. Together with Funakoshi's son Gigo (Yoshitaka), Takeshi Shimoda, and Hironori Ohtsuka, Egami was among the group of Funakoshi's students who toured with him during his exhibitions of karate in Japan during the 1930s. After Gigo's death in 1945, Egami was considered Funakoshi's successor. During his early 40s, Egami began to radically rethink the effectiveness of some of his basic techniques. He writes:
During this questioning I understood one thing. Until that moment I had practiced karate with a fundamental illusion, I had confused hardness with strength and I made every effort to harden my body thinking that I would obtain more strength when hardening the body is equivalent to stopping the movement. This is a fundamental defect. I had then to start massaging and lightening the body I had struggled so many years to harden.
Egami began experimenting with a more relaxed technique.
Following the Master's death in 1957, a rift developed among Funakoshi's students (among other issues, over whether to introduce tournaments). Shotokai and JKA became separate factions. To this day, the Shotokai method of Shotokan Karate is characterized by an emphasis on developing suppleness and relaxation while rejecting tournament competition.
Shotokan Karate of America (SKA).
Tsutomu Ohshima (1930–) began practicing karate at the Waseda University club in 1948, receiving instruction from Funakoshi and Egami among others, and became captain of the club in 1952. In 1955, he moved to USC to continue his studies, and led his first U.S. practice soon afterwards. In 1957, he started the first university karate club in the United States, at Caltech, and in 1959 founded the Southern California Karate Association. As more dojos were opened throughout the U.S., the organization was renamed to Shotokan Karate of America (SKA) in 1969. SKA maintains its national headquarters in Los Angeles. Today, Ohshima is recognized as the chief instructor of many other SKA-affiliated Shotokan organizations worldwide. In 1957, Ohshima was awarded the rank of 5th "dan" by Master Funakoshi, the highest rank awarded, and by his choice, this is the rank he has retained, and the highest rank attainable in SKA.
Kenkojuku Karate Association (KKA).
It was founded in 1942 by Tomosaburo Okano, a student of both Gichin Funakoshi and his son Yoshitaka (Gigo) Funakoshi; it remains as one of the most traditional schools of Shotokan karate, with the Shotokai. The association's motto is "Inner Strength with Outward Humility". Since master Okano's passing the Kenkojuku Budokan Hombu Dojo is now run by his son Tomokatsu Okano, from the style's hombu dojo located in: 8-5, Minami-cho Hachioji-Shi Tokyo, 192 Japan.
Kenkojuku karate has just a few representatives within the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America.
Master Okano was on the panel of Masters of the Japan Karate-do Federation (JKF) and was declared a Living National Treasure of Japan before he died on July 19, 2003, at the age of 81.

The business.
The collapse of the Napoleonic empire and a long series of financial scandals and crises in the early 19th century had sapped the French economy by the time Louis XVIII took the throne. In 1816, the king formed a new French government charged with the task of rebuilding the country's economy, including eliminating its long-standing trade deficit as well as the debt incurred through war. In April that year, the government created a new body, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, expressly to safeguard public funds, including the country's civil servants' pension funds and retirement accounts.

Killing Time (Star Trek novel)

Killing Time is a "" novel written by Della Van Hise and published by Pocket Books in 1985. The original manuscript had Kirk/Spock slash fiction elements, and these were requested to be removed by Paramount, however they were not and 250,000 copies were printed. These romantic undertones between Spock and James T. Kirk were brought to the attention of the office of the creator of "Star Trek", Gene Roddenberry, who made Pocket Books recall the first edition. This edition subsequently became a collector's item, with more than fifty changes made to a revised version.
Plot.
The USS "Enterprise" is on patrol near the Romulan neutral zone and the crew is experiencing unusual dreams. Captain James T. Kirk and Science Officer Spock both confess that they are having dreams that Spock is Captain of the ship and Kirk is an Ensign. Kirk informs Spock that Starfleet intelligence has discovered that the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and are sending more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS "ShiKahr", which appears to otherwise be the "Enterprise". The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict who has been on board for only a day.
The Romulans had attempted to travel back in time and destroy the Federation, but they instead created a Federation dominated by Vulcans. They shielded a ship from the changes and compare the differences, realising that it needs to be reversed. Meanwhile, Captain Spock begins to act protectively of Ensign Kirk, but the Captain is injured on an away mission. After Doctor McCoy conducts a series of mental scans, the crew of the "ShiKahr" realise that history has been altered. The Romulans plot to use Kirk to force Spock to impersonate their leader. Spock mindmelds with Kirk, each realising their personas from the main timeline.
Romulan agents board the "ShiKahr" and capture Kirk. Spock agrees to their demands and travels with them. Whilst en route, Spock enters pon farr and finds that he is linked to Kirk, but mates with the Romulan Thea to allow it to pass. They retrieve Kirk, and discover that taking Kirk and Spock was a ploy to have them both travel back in time to stop the Romulan agents from preventing the formation of the Federation. They travel back in time and disable the agents, but Spock is seriously injured and dying. Kirk and Spock mindmeld as reality shifts once more and restores the original timeline.
Development.
The original manuscript of "Killing Time" included Kirk/Spock based slash fiction overtones. Author Della van Hise had previously written slash fan fiction about the two characters. When that manuscript was sent by Pocket Books for approval by Paramount Studios, the pages with the slash fiction were marked to be edited out of the eventual novel. It was returned, but at the time Pocket Books were between editors as Mimi Panich had just left, and her replacement Karen Haas had not yet arrived. At some point, someone went through the manuscript and marked the pages which Paramount had asked to be removed with the letters "STET", which is a Latin term used by proofreaders to tell the printer to disregard earlier changes.
Pocket Books published 250,000 copies of "Killing Time" in the first print run. After the publishing, Gene Roddenberry's assistant, Richard Arnold, received a letter from a reader stating that the book was suggesting a romantic link between Kirk and Spock. This was passed to Roddenberry, the creator of "Star Trek", who reportedly "became livid". Following his complaints to Pocket Books, the first print run of the novel was recalled and destroyed. Pocket Books had already shipped between 100,000 to 150,000 copies of the book to retailers. When the news broke, fans began purchasing the novels before they could be removed from the shelves as the first edition was expected to become a collector's item. Van Hise later said of that version of the novel, "If someone went looking for 'questionable material', in Killing Time, they could find it... Just as beauty is in supposedly in the mind of the beholder, so is questionable material." More than fifty changes were made to the novel before it was republished as a second edition.
Following the issues with the publishing of "Killing Time", there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were stepping out of the bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.
Critical reception.
Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer, writing for Tor.com in February 2013, said that "Killing Time" was "incredibly romantic". She stated that it reminded her of 18th century literary Romanticism, "which suggested that morality lay in nature and civilization was a corrupting influence". She said that whilst it could be considered to be "a trivial piece of fluff tossed off by a fan writer and published when Pocket Books wasn’t paying much attention", it could also be seen to be a "call to action that requires readers to examine their relationships and their actions". In Elizabeth Woledge's article for "Extrapolation", entitled "From Slash to the Mainstream: Female Writers and Gender Blending Men", she describes "Killing Time" as "erotic but not sexual" and said that Spock and Kirk both "combine masculine and feminine imagery". She suggested that it was not the romantic overtones that caused the reaction, but rather that it was this gender-blending that was the issue.

Biomedical waste

BioMedical Waste, (BMW), consists of solids, liquids, sharps, and laboratory waste that are potentially infectious or dangerous and are considered biowaste. It must be properly managed to protect the general public, specifically healthcare and sanitation workers who are regularly exposed to biomedical waste as an occupational hazard. In hospitals, "medical waste", otherwise known as "clinical waste", normally refers to waste products that cannot be considered general waste, produced from healthcare premises, such as hospitals, clinics, doctors offices, veterinary hospitals and labs.
Biomedical waste differs from other types of hazardous waste, such as industrial waste, in that it comes from biological sources or is used in the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases. Common producers of biomedical waste include hospitals, health clinics, nursing homes, medical research laboratories, offices of physicians, dentists, and veterinarians, home health care, and funeral homes.
Regulation by country.
United Kingdom.
In the UK, clinical waste and the way it is to be handled is closely regulated. Applicable legislation includes the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Part II), Waste Management Licencing Regulations 1994, and the Hazardous Waste Regulations (England & Wales) 2005, as well as the Special Waste Regulations in Scotland.
United States.
In 1988 the Federal government passed The Medical Waste Tracking Act which set the standards for governmental regulation of medical waste. After the Act expired in 1991, States were given the responsibility to regulate and pass laws concerning the disposal of medical waste. All fifty states vary in their regulations from no regulations to very strict.
Disposal of this waste is an environmental concern, as many medical wastes are classified as "infectious" or "biohazardous" and could potentially lead to the spread of infectious disease. Examples of infectious waste include blood, potentially contaminated "sharps" such as needles and scalpels, and identifiable body parts. Sharps include used needles, lancets, and other devices capable of penetrating skin. Infectious waste is often incinerated. The most common method of sterilization is an autoclave. The autoclave uses steam and pressure to sterilize the waste. Additionally, medical facilities produce a variety of waste hazardous chemicals, including radioactive materials. While such wastes are normally not infectious, they may be classified as hazardous wastes, and require proper disposal.
In the United States, there are three main methods for medical waste generators to dispose of their waste: On-site, truck service, and mail-back disposal. On-site treatment involves the use of very expensive equipment, and is generally only used by very large hospitals and major universities who have the means to afford such equipment. Truck service involves hiring of a medical waste disposal service whose employees are trained to collect and haul away medical waste in special containers (usually cardboard boxes, or reusable plastic bins) for treatment at a facility designed to handle large amounts of medical waste. Mail-back medical waste disposal is similar, except that the waste is shipped through the U.S. postal service instead of by private hauler. Although currently available in all 50 U.S. states, mail-back medical waste disposal is limited to very strict postal regulations (collection and shipping containers must be approved by the postal service for use) and only available by a handful of companies.
Management.
Specialized equipment is required to meet OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1450 and EPA 40 CFR 264.173. standards of safety. Minimal recommended equipment include a fume hood and primary and secondary waste containers to capture potential overflow. Even beneath the fume hood, containers containing chemical contaminants should remain closed when not in use. An open funnel placed in the mouth of a waste container has been shown to allow significant evaporation of chemicals into the surrounding atmosphere, which is then inhaled by laboratory personnel, and contributes a primary component to the threat of completing the fire triangle. To protect the health and safety of laboratory staff as well as neighboring civilians and the environment, proper waste management equipment, such as the Burkle funnel in Europe and the ECO Funnel in the U.S., should be utilized in any department which deals with chemical waste.

Dwellers in the Crucible

Dwellers in the Crucible is a 1985 "" novel written by Margaret Wander Bonanno. A bestseller, it was the author's breakout novel, retelling the central "Star Trek" story of the friendship between James T. Kirk and Spock through the experiences of two female civilians, Egyptian Cleante al Faisal and Vulcan T'Shael. It is noted for its emphasis on interpersonal relationships over action, and for the minimal role played in the story by the franchise's established characters.
Reception and legacy.
"Dwellers" was positively received at publication. While "Fantasy Review" emphasised the regular cast's incidental appearance in the novel, they recommended it highly despite its "minor flaws": ""Dwellers in the Crucible" is an excellent study of values ... here are things here to think about which belie the Star Trek image."
Later, recalling "Dwellers" in 2009, author Keith R. A. DeCandido would describe the impact the "cool" story had on him: "I didn't know that a "Star Trek" book could do that."
Controversy.
In 1992, Bonanno was contracted by Pocket Books to write a followup novel to "". Her manuscript, entitled "Music of the Spheres", reintroduced "Dwellers" characters Cleante and T'Shael. As "Dwellers" had done, "Music" focused on Bonanno's characters rather than on the familiar characters from the television show. This had not been a difficulty in 1985, but by 1992 Paramount Pictures had introduced new standards for "Star Trek" tie-in novels, which outlawed extensive use of original characters.
The story was heavily rewritten, and that rewrite subsequently rewritten by Gene DeWeese. The derivative novel was eventually published as "Probe", still naming Bonanno as the author. Despite her wishes, Pocket Books refused to strip her name from the book. Bonanno stated at the time that only one page of the published novel resembled what she had written.
Plot.
On the planet Vulcan, several representatives of each Federation world are kept as "Warrantors of the Peace". As close relatives of the leaders of their worlds, they serve as hostages against the actions of their planetary governments, and are immediately killed if their world attacks another Federation planet.
Six of these Warrantors - an Andorian, a human, a Vulcan and three Deltans - are kidnapped and held by the Romulan Empire. The Andorian is killed during the kidnap, and the three Deltans are tortured to death by their Klingon captors, acting for the Romulans. The plot focuses on the cultural differences and eventual friendship between the two surviving captives, T'Shael and Cleante.

The Infected (band)

The Infected (or simply, Infected) is one of the longest standing punk bands from Lexington, Kentucky, formed in 1993 and having released twelve albums and EPs. The band, signed on the Eugene Records label, went through many iterations, before going on hiatus in 2003 and returning in 2006 as "hometown heroes".
History.
Infected or The Infected were formed by Nathan Waters aka Nasty Nate, Robert Gunning and Brandon Faukner in 1993. This was the lineup for the limited release of ""All the Shit You Hate"", recorded in 1994 and 1995.
"Buff" Mike Nagiec joined to play bass in 1995, and Sean Degan joined as second guitarist later on. Faukner left in late 1996, citing creative differences, and Degan was pressed into drumming. This lineup released the band's first full-length studio LP, ""New Defiance"" and the notable 'Alano' show, bootlegs of which are one of the few known live recordings of this version of the band.
Kevin Davis, former member of several local punk bands, notably 'Blatherskyte' with Nathan Waters, replaced Degan on drums in 1996. A few weeks later, Andrew "Andy-Boy" Hibpshman joined as second guitarist, but moved to bass when Naigec decided to quit the band. This lineup lasted a year.
Gunning left the band in 1997, and the band was searching for a replacement guitarist for some time. Mark Borders, originally a member of the seminal Berea, Kentucky hardcore punk band Deep 13 eventually joined to play guitar, and the most stable lineup of the band, lasting from 1997 to 2000, was complete. The cassette EP ""Progress in the Downtime"", the full-length album ""Tolerance for Failure"", the ""Floormodeled"" EP, a split 7" record with local band Redheaded Stepchildren and the second installment of ""All the Shit You Hate"" were all produced during this time, along with the band's first cross-country tours and many regional performances.
Kevin Davis was replaced in 2000 and a series of drummers followed. Edgar Purdom was the longest-lasting of these, filling the role for a little under a year. He left, however, to join label mates The Brassknuckle Boys. Rocky Borders, of Redheaded Stepchildren and Mark's brother, eventually joined as drummer. This was the longest-lasting lineup for the Infected, producing the unreleased studio album ""All-Time Low"" and the ""I5"" single, as the band disbanded in 2003.
In September, 2006, the Infected played a reunion concert in order to promote the CD ""Tales of the Tortured Mind"", a retrospective of material from 1996-2003. This release was pressed specifically to fund the release of “"All Time Low",” which has been in hiatus due to lack of funding for three years. A second show was played on September 30, 2006, also to fund the release of “"All Time Low"”. The first show featured the drummer from the Lexington-based rock and roll band HEARTTHROB, while the second has Rocky Borders returning to the lineup. Rocky Borders played his last show with the band on June 16, 2007, with Edgar Purdom rejoining the band a little more than a month later. The Infected recorded a three song demo directly after Purdom joined the band. However, this line up only lasted for 4 months, with the group deciding to let him go. In 2007, Kelly Patrick Cammack was hired to play drums.
In May 2008 Infected parted ways once again, only for Nate to regroup with an all new line up in July 2008. Kevin Davis returned to play drums, along with original guitarist Robert Gunning and long time friend of the band, Mike "Beans" McCarter on bass. Mark Borders went on to play guitar for Green Jellÿ. Mike "Beans" McCarter eventually left the band in 2011 after falling out with other members.
Since then Infected has fine tuned their lineup, before settling with their current group, which includes the additions of Kevin Mutz on drums, Eric Nickel on Bass, and Chris Reeves as the lead guitarist. As of 2012 Infected continue to tour the U.S., with recent summer tour dates added to the bands web page http://www.infectedrockshop.com
In Jan 2013 long time off and on Infected drummer Kevin Davis returned to the band on second guitar replacing Kris Anglin. Infected also completed a new full length set to be out in March 2013, as well as more tour dates to be announced any day.
Related bands.
The Infected shared many members with other Lexington, Kentucky punk and hardcore bands, most notably the Redheaded Stepchildren (Rocky Borders) and Deep 13 (Mark Borders and Andrew (Andyboy) Hibpshman). Kevin Davis was in the band Blatherskyte with Nathan Waters. Side projects were also very widespread, such as Bitchkiller, featuring Andrew Hibpshman with several ex-members of local grindcore band Ungrateful, and Kane (also known as Cane), which was a humorous hardcore band along the lines of Anal Cunt and Spazz, featuring the members of the Infected and Deep 13 playing instruments that they did not play in their normal band (with the exception of Mark, who played drums in Deep 13 at the time, and Tom Spalding of Deep 13, who played bass in both bands). Both of these bands were relatively short lived, however. The most significant side project was Squall Line. It also featured members of other local bands and former and present Infected members. Andyboy was also in Kill Toby Wyatt which featured members from Deep 13 and The Parlor Boys and is now playing drums with local stoner rockers Stampede and playing guitar in Hateshrines with former Infected and Deep 13 band mate Mark Borders. Andy has now started a stoner/emo band called Horned Owl as well. Mark Borders has been running sound for bands such as Nashville Pussy, Motörhead, The Black Dahlia Murder, and various others, as well as playing guitar with Green Jellÿ and Dwarves.

Imagination Is the Only Escape

Imagination is the Only Escape is an upcoming video game by Luc Bernard, the creator of "Mecho Wars". It is currently being developed for the Nintendo DS, but it has also been suggested that the game may be released as a WiiWare game instead. However he has since expressed interest in bringing the title to Wii U.
Set in France during World War II, "Imagination Is The Only Escape" is an educational title aiming to teach children about The Holocaust.
Story.
The story starts off before the Occupation of France by Nazi Germany. The player is introduced to the main character, a Jewish boy named Samuel who is playing with his friends, going to school, and living a normal life in Paris. However, when France is invaded by the Nazis, Samuel and his family are soon forced to move to a ghetto and wear the yellow star of David on their clothes.
The scene changes to the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, the mass arrest of Jews in Paris that took place on July 16, 1942. During the chaos Samuel's mother tells him to escape the city. She takes off his star so he can't be recognized as a Jew, and gives him the address of a Catholic priest who can help him escape Paris and the occupied part of France. As Samuel escapes, his mother is spotted and taken away.
Samuel starts his journey to find the priest, sneaking his way through Paris. Samuel soon finds him, and is smuggled out to southern France. They arrive at a small village hidden in a forest, where the villagers are passing off Jewish children from all over France as Christian orphans, and soon Samuel meets a fox who tells him that if he helps him he will be able to see his mother again.
Development.
In 2013, Bernard started an Indiegogo drive for "Imagination Is the Only Escape".
Controversy.
"Imagination" has courted controversy for its dark setting and subject matter.
Nintendo of America has stated that they have no plans to release the game. Bernard claims that the company is afraid of the game's subject matter, but believes Nintendo of Europe will not block its release.

Nathaniel Massie

Nathaniel Massie (December 28, 1763 – November 13, 1813) was a frontier surveyor in the Ohio Country who became a prominent land owner, politician, and soldier. He founded fourteen early towns in what became the State of Ohio, including its first capital, Chillicothe. In 1807, the Ohio General Assembly declared him the winner of the election for governor, but he refused the office.
Early life.
A native of the colony of Virginia, Massie served briefly in the Virginia militia during the American Revolutionary War. After becoming a surveyor, he established the first town in the Virginia Military District at what is now Manchester. He platted the town of Chillicothe on his own land. Massie was one of the largest landowners in early Ohio, and served as a major general in the Ohio militia.
Political career.
Massie served as a Ross county delegate to the 1802 Ohio Constitutional Convention and was a leader of the Jeffersonian faction that supported statehood. He was a leader of the Chillicothe Junto, a group of Chillicothe Democratic-Republican politicians who brought about the admission of Ohio as a state in 1803, and largely controlled its politics for some years thereafter. Among his colleagues in the faction were Thomas Worthington and Edward Tiffin. He was a Presidential elector for Thomas Jefferson in 1804 and James Madison in 1808. He was a Trustee of Ohio University from 1804 to 1808. Massie served in the General Assembly and was the first president of the Ohio Senate.
Death.
Massie led troops in the War of 1812, but died of pneumonia in the late autumn of 1813 at the age of 50. He is interred in Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe in Ross County, Ohio.
Legacy.
The Nathaniel Massie Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) in Chillicothe is named in the general's honor, as is Massie Township in Warren County, Ohio and the Clinton-Massie Local School District that serves the area.
Massie is a member of the Ohio Hall of Fame.

Brookspoint

Brookspoint is a barangay located in the Aurora Hill district of Baguio City in the Philippines.
Name.
Brookspoint was often referred to as the "Workingmen's Village", referring to the land owners during the time of Mayor Luis Lardizabal, until the name was changed to what it is known as today under Resolution 47-1974; Regular Meeting held on February 27, 1974 D-2A6. The name Brookspoint is believed to have originated from its location, bounded by brooks and creeks.
Political division.
Originally, the barangay was only a small territory, since its area was composed of only 3 Puroks. As time progressed and the number of people increased, houses were built within and around the area, increasing the need to establish its correct boundaries. At present, Brookspoint is composed of seven puroks, and is surrounded by nearby barangays such as Pacdal, East Modernsite, South Central,and Bayan Park.
Demographics.
As of the 2000 census of the NSCB, Brookspoint had a total population of 1,477. NSO 2007 Census, poulation is 2,081. NSO Census 2010, population is 2,299.(NSO Statistics)
Geography.
Land Area - The total land area of Brookspoint is approximately 13.64 square kilometers. This is inclusive of parts of the mountains. The landmarks circumscribing the community which roughly delineate its boundaries are:
Language and Dialects.
The residents of Brookspoint are a mixture of different peoples of different cultural and ethnical backgrounds who speak varied languages. The most common spoken language is Ilocano, with a large number of residents from the Tagalog ethnic group.

James Taylor discography

The discography of James Taylor, an American singer-songwriter, consists of sixteen studio albums, six compilation albums, four live albums, one tribute album, seven video albums, one extended play, and forty singles.
Taylor signed his first recording contract with Apple Records, where he released his self-titled debut album to the United Kingdom the same year and to the United States in 1969, where it peaked at #62 on the "Billboard 200" albums chart. After overcoming a drug addiction, Taylor released his second album "Sweet Baby James" on Warner Bros. Records in 1970. Its lead single "Fire and Rain" became a significant international hit and gained Taylor his first major exposure as an artist. In April 1971, Taylor released his third studio album "Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon", which became his second album to certify multi-platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America and featured his first number one single "You've Got a Friend". In 1972 and 1973, he released his fourth studio album, "One Man Dog" and his fifth, "Walking Man"; both peaked within the Top 20 on the Billboard 200 albums list.
After releasing more albums between 1974 and 1976, Taylor signed with Columbia Records and issued "JT" in 1977, which peaked in the Top 5 and sold over two million copies in the United States, certifying two times multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1979 and 1981, Taylor respectively released "Flag" and "Dad Loves His Work", which both certified platinum in the United States and produced Top 40 singles. Nearly four years later, Taylor's next studio album "That's Why I'm Here" was released and spawned a cover of Buddy Holly's "Everyday", which only became a minor hit in the United States. This was followed by "Never Die Young" three years later and then by "New Moon Shine" in 1991, both of which sold over one million copies. After recording a two-disc live album in 1993, Taylor returned in 1997 with a fourteenth studio album entitled "Hourglass". The album not only peaked at #9 on the "Billboard 200", but also received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Album the following year. His fifteenth studio release "October Road" was issued on August 13, 2002 on Sony BMG and certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. After recording a limited release in 2004, Taylor released his first major-release holiday album, "James Taylor at Christmas" on October 10, 2006. "One Man Band" was released in 2007 and certified gold in the United States, which was followed by Taylor's first cover album in 2008 on the Hear Music label. It was followed-up by a sequel extended play entitled "Other Covers" in 2009. In the United States alone, James Taylor has sold thirty three million records according to the Recording Industry Association of America.

Adaptation to global warming in Australia

Introduction.
According to non-governmental organisations such as Greenpeace and global scientific organisations such as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the frequency and intensity of disasters brought about by greenhouse gas emissions and climate change will grow rapidly in the world. The risks are particularly severe in some regions of Australia, such as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, the Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales. The Department of Climate Change said in its Climate Change Impacts and Costs fact sheet: "...ecologically rich sites, such as the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland Wet Tropics,
Kakadu Wetlands, Australian Alpine areas, south-western Australia and sub-
Antarctic islands are all at risk, with significant loss of biodiversity projected to
occur by 2020". It also said: "Very conservatively, 90 Australian animal species have so far been identified at risk from climate change, including mammals, insects, birds, reptiles, fish and amphibians from all parts of Australia." Australia is already the driest populated continent in the world.
Climate change is recognised as one of the largest global crises. The issue has gained traction around the world as the world becomes increasingly urbanised. This is because urbanisation brings irreversible changes in our patterns of resource/waste production and consumption. Therefore, how to plan, manage and live in cities in the light of global warming largely determines and depends on the progress of the climate change phenomenon.
According to projections by the Department of Climate Change in Australia, it is expected that national average temperatures would increase by 0.4 to 2.0 °C [http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/impacts/projections/index.html]. Rainfall patterns and the degree of droughts and storms brought about by extreme weather conditions are likely to be affected.
Research has suggested that nearly three quarters of global energy consumption occur in cities, while emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming come from urban areas. Nearly a third of these emissions are caused by the burning of fossil fuels used in urban transportation. Another third is formed from the energy used to regulate building temperature and to run personal appliances. The final third is contributed by the industrial sector. The main emitters of greenhouse gases are the construction, real estate, agriculture and metallurgical industries, the transportation sector, the industrial uses of fossil fuels and the burning of biomass. Some examples of daily activities that contribute to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere include the use of carbon-based electricity in street lighting, driving motor vehicles, cooking, and the lighting, heating and cooling of housing.
If the policies of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries remain unchanged, specifically Australia and the United States, and also China and India, carbon dioxide emissions, which represents 72% of all greenhouse gas emissions, will increase by a third in the year 2020 instead of the 5% reduction as was approved in the Kyoto Protocol.
With the current path of climate change, the world population is entering an era of growing urban vulnerability. The accelerated pace of urbanisation and the fact that a growing segment of the world's population now live in cities has significantly increased the vulnerability of urban areas as anthropogenic hazards and agents for climate change. It will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between what is caused by humans and what is natural because both risks are overlapping.
Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
Emissions of greenhouse gases emanating from urban areas can be mitigated through four types of action:
Urban Density.
Demand for energy in high-rise buildings is lower than that of suburban housing families. Infrastructure costs and emissions are lower if the costs for the consumption of land, transport and transfer times are lower. The number of people with cars in the city is much lower than in the suburbs, where public transport benefits from serious investments. The expansive urban growth should be avoided and discouraged at all costs.
Construction and energy efficiency.
The operation and maintenance of residential buildings and offices are responsible for 38% of CO. Much of this figure comes from the air conditioning. It is therefore necessary to reduce energy needs for heating, lighting and cooling of buildings, but also increase efficiency in the use of technologies to build and own cycle construction.
Administration of transport demand.
The vigorous promotion of mass transportation systems, pedestrian areas, non-motorised transport and use of more fuel-efficient cars can drastically reduce the total volume of carbon dioxide.
Production of cleaner energy.
The shift from coal to natural gas in power plants, and the promotion of the use of clean and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy to replace energy from fossil fuels present significant opportunities.
Adaptation.
According to the IPCC's 2001 Assessment Report, no matter how much effort is put into mitigating climate change, some amount of climate change cannot be avoided. The report shared that adaptation should complement mitigation efforts.
Adaptation is the approach that focuses on alleviating current problems brought about by global warming and climate change. It is the attempt to live with the changes in the environment and the economy that global warming has generated and will continue to generate. In short, it involves taking action to deal with the problems brought about by global warming and climate change. Examples include building better flood defences and avoiding the building of residential areas near low-lying, flood-prone areas.
In contrast, mitigation focuses on steps taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is the set of preventative measures taken to curb global warming and climate change. Examples would be investing in clean fuel and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power.
Although national governments and local authorities are taking stringent mitigation measures, the need for adaptation is in the interest of dealing with climate change because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for decades and is trapped in oceans for centuries, thereby resulting in a change in ocean chemistry and may adversely affect ocean life. No matter how much humanity cuts greenhouse gas emissions now, the emissions released now will have an impact for decades. Therefore, adaptation is crucial for cities looking towards strengthening their resistance against the climate impact that past emissions have caused – to deal with the problems caused by greenhouse gas emissions pumped out years ago.
The determinants of adaptive capacity include the availability of financial resources, technology, specialised institutions and human resources, as well as access to information and existence of laws (both social and organisational) – attributes and resources that are usually scarce in developing countries and in small cities. In cities with a proven vulnerability to climate change, investment is likely to require the strengthening of urban infrastructure, including storm drain systems, water supply and treatment plants, and protection or relocation of solid waste management and power generation facilities.
Coastal regions are likely to need large investment in physical infrastructure projects, specifically projects related to the effects of rising sea levels. Projects such as the construction of protective barriers against rising sea levels, the building of dams to retain and manage water, the redesign and development of port facilities and the improvement of the defence systems at coastal areas should be carried out.
Another measure of adaptation is the construction of new cities on higher ground, withdrawing the population away from vulnerable floodplains. This withdrawal would probably be managed over time, and may require a public-private partnership consisting of a combination of market incentives such as the differential cost of insurance and re-insurance, and investment planning.
Internalising the limitations of climate change requires proper planning for land use and the adherence to building codes. Planning for land use should channel new residential developments and productive investment towards less vulnerable areas. The inhabitants of slums and informal housing should receive assistance to regularise their properties, enabling low-income groups such as themselves to buy, build or rent homes in secure locations.
As a basis for planning, local authorities need a reliable and well-informed assessment of the risks faced by urban cities. The dissemination of such information, and establishing early warning systems and evacuation plans including warning systems for emergencies, disaster response and improved urban environmental management is crucial for adapting to the dangers of climate change.
Projects concerning adaptation to climate change in Australia.
The Australian Government has pledged to spend some A$1.8 billion (US$ on climate change. The country's national, state and territory policy makers have supported a National Biodiversity and Climate Change Action Plan that works to manage the impacts of climate change on wildlife. The nation is also interested to co-ordinate the management of its coasts and strives to lessen the effects of climate change on agriculture.
National Climate Change Adaptation Programme.
The Department of Climate Change (Australia) has come up with the National Climate Change
Adaptation Programme which aims to work with industries, scientific organisations, residents and other governments to create workable solutions. According to the programme brochure, "Guidelines, planning tools and information about climate change impacts form the basis of the Programme".
Some A$14 million over a period of four years (2008–2012) is to be spent on this initiative [http://www.climatechange.gov.au/impacts/nccap/index.html].
The programme has forged strong research links in at-risk areas such as the Great Barrier Reef. Research conducted in the Great Barrier Reef is focused on developing methods to deal with climate change to protect the reef. It is hoped that this work will create a universal model for sustainable, cost-effective reef development.
According to the programme's brochure: "National greenhouse mitigation policies and programmes are projected to reduce emissions by 94 million tonnes by 2010 – the equivalent of removing every motor vehicle in Australia from the road! However, the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere and the growing emissions from around the world will affect our climate. Adaptation to climate change will complement action to reduce greenhouse gases".
Climate Adaptation Flagship.
The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) started the Climate Adaptation Flagship with the aim of "enabling Australia to adapt more effectively to the impacts of climate change and variability and informing national planning, regulation and investment decisions". This is part of the National Research Flagships Program [http://www.csiro.au/partnerships/NRF.html, designed to bring various stakeholders, i.e. research companies, industries, international connections, eminent scientists and CSIRO, together in hope of delivering practical solutions that address the pressing issues of Australia.
The Climate Adaptation Flagship project concerns both climate variability (or non-human causes, as defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and climate change. The research budget for this Flagship for the year 2008–09 is close to A$30 million [http://www.csiro.au/news/CAFLaunch.html]. There are four research prongs to this project:
National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.
NCCARF is hosted by Griffith University in Queensland and "leads the research community in a national interdisciplinary effort to generate the information needed by decision-makers in government and in vulnerable sectors and communities to manage the risks of climate change impacts.".
The key roles of NCCARF include:

TacSat-4

TacSat-4 is the fourth in a series of U.S. military experimental reconnaissance and communication satellites. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is the program manager. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored the development of the payload and funded the first year of operations. The Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) funded the standardized spacecraft bus and the Operationally Responsive Space Office (ORS) funded the launch that will be performed by the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC).
The spacecraft was completed by the end of 2009, and was launched on September 27, 2011, on a Minotaur IV rocket into a highly elliptical orbit.
Mission.
TacSat-4 is equipped with a antenna operating 10 Ultra High Frequency (UHF) channels that can be used for any combination of communications, data ex-filtration or Blue Force Tracking (BFT). TacSat-4 will fly the highly elliptical, 4-hour, orbit (12,050 kilometers at peak) providing typical payload communication periods of two hours per orbit. TacSat-4’s orbit also allows it to cover the high latitudes.
Part of its capability is rapid (within 24 hours) reallocation to different theaters worldwide, in support of unexpected operations. Command and control of TacSat-4 will be performed at the NRL Satellite Operations Center at Blossom Point, Maryland. Payload tasking will be performed via the SIPRNet based Virtual Mission Operations Center (VMOC).
Design.
All TacSat satellites are designed to demonstrate the ability to provide real-time data collected from space to combatant commanders in the field.
The spacecraft bus was built by NRL and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) to mature ORS bus standards developed by an Integrated (government and industry) System Engineering Team, the “ISET Team,” with active representation from AeroAstro, Air Force Research Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Laboratory APL, ATK Space, Ball Aerospace & Technologies, Boeing, Design Net Engineering, General Dynamics AIS, Microcosm, Sierra Nevada Corp., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lincoln Laboratory, Orbital Sciences, NRL, SMC, Space Systems/Loral, and Raytheon.

Seven Society (College of William &amp; Mary)

The Seven Society, Order of the Crown & Dagger (colloquially known as the Seven '7' Society or Sevens '7s') is the longest continually active secret society of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. The clandestine, yet altruistic group is said to consist of seven senior individuals
, selected in their junior year. While, historically, graduating members formally announced their identities each spring, today's membership is steeped in mystery and is only revealed upon a member's death.
Now rumored to meet late at night in Colonial Williamsburg's Shields Tavern, present-day Sevens are perhaps most noted for their efforts to honor and encourage those who help strengthen the university. Through its endowment association, the society pursues major philanthropic projects such as scholarships and anonymous donations to the College. Sevens have also been known to mysteriously leave small gifts and tokens of appreciation for unsuspecting groups and individuals (e.g., in 2003, an admissions counselor discovered two dozen golf umbrellas – each adorned with the '7' symbol – after casually mentioning how helpful they'd be during rainy campus tours).
History.
The Seven Society is most commonly believed to have been founded in 1826. Little else is known about the society's early history; for the College of William & Mary, the second half of the 19th century brought the American Civil War, two devastating campus fires, and the College's subsequent closing from 1881 to 1888. But by the beginning of the 20th century, the Sevens had resurfaced; and in 1939 the group publicly declared themselves to be “the only secret society of the College of William and Mary" (other recorded groups – namely "The 13s", "Alphas", and "Flat Hats" – were highly selective student clubs that would later be revived as secret societies).
Motifs and symbols.
In chartering the College of William & Mary, founding benefactors King William III and Queen Mary II of England sought to establish "a certain place of universal study" to be led by "one President, six Masters or Professors." Together these seven individuals would be known simply as the "Society". In 1729, after the full installation of the College’s "departments" (a president and six professors), corporate authority of William & Mary was transferred from the College’s surviving trustees to the seven-member Society. The group served as the governing body for the university – ensuring William & Mary’s continuous wellbeing and future prosperity.
A seven motif appears elsewhere on the campus. The Royal Charter instructs chancellors to serve seven year terms. The Sunken Gardens area is crossed with seven brick pathways. Seven buildings surround the gardens- Washington Hall, Ewell Hall, McGlothin Street Hall, the Christopher Wren building, John Tyler Hall, Tucker Hall, and James Blair Hall. Of the lodge buildings, housing in the middle of campus traditionally held by seniors, seven are used for housing.
Tyler and "The Seven Wise Men".
The most legendary Society was established and led by the College’s 17th president, Lyon Gardiner Tyler. Still suffering from the effects of the Civil War, William & Mary was ultimately forced to close its doors in 1881. After being closed for seven years, the school was reopened in 1888 by the then newly appointed president, Lyon G. Tyler. By 1891, President Tyler had managed to assemble a "small but able" teaching staff that included professors Hugh S. Bird, Charles E. Bishop, Van F. Garrett, J. Lesslie Hall, Thomas J. Stubbs, and Lyman B. Wharton. Affectionately dubbed the "Seven Wise Men" by students, Tyler and the six professors are credited not only with reviving William & Mary but also for transforming the College into a thriving, modern-day university.

Ronald Gray

Ronald Adrin Gray (born 1966) is an American spree killer whose convictions include four counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and eight counts of rape. His crimes were committed when he was in the United States Army, stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was tried and convicted by military courts, and was sentenced to be put to death. His execution by lethal injection would be the first performed by the United States military since the execution of John A. Bennett for rape and attempted murder in 1961. On November 26, 2008, a federal judge issued a stay of execution stopping the planned December 10 execution. On January 26, 2012, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief in Gray's case. Gray's lawyers plan to appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
Early life.
Gray was born in Cochran, Georgia, but grew up in Liberty City, a public housing project in Miami, Florida. He enlisted at age 18 in 1984, and was assigned to the Target Acquisition Battery, 1-39 Field Artillery Battalion. At the time of his arrest, he was stationed at Fort Bragg, near Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he was a cook assigned to 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. He held the rank of specialist (E-4).
During his court-martial, his mother Lizzie Hurd and sister testified that he had been abused by his stepfather as a child. Colonel David Armitage, a military forensic psychiatrist, also testified that in Gray's early life, he had experienced:
Gray's crimes.
On December 15, 1986, Gray abducted, raped, sodomized, and murdered Private Laura Lee Vickery-Clay, age 18. On January 3, 1987, he raped and attempted to murder Private Mary Ann Lang Nameth, age 20. Three days later, on January 6, he raped, sodomized, robbed, and murdered a civilian, Kimberly Ann Ruggles, age 23.
The first victim, Vickery-Clay, disappeared from Fort Bragg on December 15, 1986. Two witnesses saw her at a local K-Mart with a man later identified as Gray. Vickery-Clay's car, found the next morning a block from her home, appeared to have been driven through the woods, and the driver's seat was set back farther than necessary for Vickery-Clay to drive. Three of Gray's fingerprints were found on the hood of the car. On January 17, 1987, a soldier discovered Vickery-Clay's half-naked, decomposed body in the woods in Fort Bragg. She had been raped, sodomized, and shot in the neck, forehead, chest, and back of the head. She had also suffered blunt force trauma to various parts of her body. The murder weapon, a .22 caliber pistol that Gray had stolen in November 1986, was found 60 feet from the victim's body.
On January 3, 1987, Gray entered the barracks room of Private Mary Ann Lang Nameth under the pretense of needing to use the bathroom. Once inside, Gray grabbed Nameth, held a knife to her throat, and asked for her military field gear. Gray tied Nameth's hands behind her back, removed her underclothing, and raped her. Gray then stabbed her repeatedly in the neck and on the side of her body, and threatened to return and kill her if she screamed. Nameth suffered a lacerated trachea and a collapsed lung, but survived. When Gray's photograph appeared in the news following his arrest for another crime, Nameth identified him as her assailant.
On the evening of January 6, 1987, Kimberly Ann Ruggles, a local cab driver, was dispatched to pick up a passenger named "Ron" at Gray's address. In the early morning hours of January 7, military police officers on routine patrol discovered Ruggles' empty cab parked at the edge of the woods. Her nude body was discovered a short distance away. She had been raped, sodomized, beaten, and stabbed seven times. Ruggles' mouth was gagged with a cloth belt that matched a pair of black karate pants other police officers had found in Gray's possession hours earlier. Gray's fingerprints were on the interior door handle of Ruggles' taxi, and Ruggles' fingerprints were found on money in Gray's possession. Gray's footprints were also found at the scene of the crime.
Arrest, trial, conviction and sentence.
On August 7, 1987, Gray was charged with two counts of murder (Ruggles and Vickery-Clay) and two counts of attempted murder on a military reservation.
On November 5, 1987, Gray pleaded guilty in Cumberland County Superior Court to 22 felonies: two counts of second degree murder, two counts of first degree burglary, five counts of first degree rape, five counts of first degree sexual offense, attempted first degree rape, three counts of second degree kidnapping, two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, and inflicting serious injury. He was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent terms of life imprisonment for those crimes.
Gray was also tried by a military court. The general court-martial lasted from December 1987 until April 1988 and was composed of commissioned and enlisted soldiers at Fort Bragg. Gray was convicted of 14 charges, including the premeditated murders of Ruggles and Vickery-Clay, the attempted premeditated murder of Lang Nameth, three rapes, two robberies, and two counts of forcible sodomy. On April 12, 1988, he was unanimously sentenced to death. He was additionally sentenced to a Dishonorable Discharge, total Asset forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction in rank to Private E-1. On July 29, 1988, the Commanding General of the 82nd Airborne Division approved the sentence. Gray was 22 at the time of his sentencing.
Gray remained on death row at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. As a member of the United States Armed Forces Gray cannot be executed until the president approves the death sentence. On July 28, 2008, President George W. Bush approved Gray's execution, making Gray the first service member sentenced to death since 1957. One month later, Army Secretary Pete Geren set the execution date as December 10, 2008, and ordered that Gray be put to death by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. The military released the news of Gray's execution date on November 20, 2008. Army personnel will be responsible for conducting the execution, based on an agreement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
Appeals.
Immediately following Gray's court-martial, the records of the trial were forwarded to Defense Appellate Division and received by them on August 8, 1988. Counsel filed initial pleadings with the Court of Military Review on September 15, 1989. On February 13, 1990, that court ordered a sanity board, which, on June 30, 1990, found that Gray was responsible at the time of the offenses and that he was competent to understand his trial and the present appellate proceedings. On July 20, 1990, the Government Appellate Division answered Gray’s assignment of errors.
On December 27, 1990, Gray filed a motion with the Court of Military Review requesting that court to order the Government to provide $15,000 for an expert psychiatrist, a death penalty qualified attorney, and an investigator. Oral arguments were heard on the motion in January 1991. On March 12, 1991, the Court of Military Review denied the motion. Gray renewed his request for a psychiatrist and an investigator on August 7, 1991, but the Court of Military Review denied it on August 23, 1991. On September 12, 1991, Gray filed a writ-appeal petition requesting that this Court order the Government to provide $10,000 and an emergency stay of the proceedings before the Court of Military Review. On October 18, 1991, this Court denied the writ-appeal petition and the stay application.
On December 16, 1991, Gray filed a motion with the Court of Military Review requesting that court to order additional medical and psychological tests be performed by military authorities. On December 31, 1991, that court granted Gray’s request and ordered a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the brain; a 20-channel scalp electrode, sleep-deprived EEG; and a SPECT scan of his brain, as well as intellectual, psychological, academic, psychological, and personality tests. On February 18, 1992, a report based on these tests was completed by Captain Fred H. Brown, Jr., Ph.D., a clinical psychologist from Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg. Brown stated in an affidavit filed with the appellate court that Gray was sane at the time of the offenses and during the proceedings. On March 9, 1992, counsel filed a petition for new trial based on newly discovered evidence of lack of mental responsibility.
On February 26, 1992, Gray filed a supplementary assignment of errors, to which the Government responded on March 27, 1992. On April 8, 1992, the Court of Military Review heard oral arguments, and on December 15, 1992, denied the petition for a new trial and affirmed the findings and sentence. On December 30, 1992, Gray filed a motion renewing his request for funds for an expert investigator and a behavioral neurologist. Gray filed a petition for reconsideration of this decision on January 4, 1993. The Court of Military Review heard oral arguments on the motion for funding on January 21, 1993, and denied the motion for funding and the petition for reconsideration on January 22, 1993. On February 11, 1993, Gray filed a motion and suggestion for reconsideration by the court sitting en banc of the denial of funding, and a motion and suggestion for reconsideration by the court sitting en banc of the decision of December 15, 1992. On March 11, 1993, the court denied both motions and the suggestions for reconsideration en banc, but granted a motion allowing Gray to file a supplemental assignment of errors (XXVIII-LVI). The Government answered this assignment of errors on April 12, 1993. On June 9, 1993, the Court of Military Review again affirmed the findings and sentence. Gray filed a motion for reconsideration on June 28, 1993, which the court denied on June 30, 1993.
With Gray's sentence affirmed by the President and the warrant issued by the Secretary of the Army, execution was scheduled for December 10, 2008. Army spokesman Lt. Col. George Wright said on November 20 (the date when the execution date was announced) that Gray had two legal options remaining: filing a petition with a federal appellate court to stay the execution, or requesting that the president reconsider approval of the execution. On November 26, 2008, a federal judge granted Gray a stay of execution to allow time for further appeals. On January 26, 2012, the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief. As of September 2013, no further action has been announced by the Army.

Dan Hanley (footballer)

Dan Hanley (born 17 May 1883) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the VFL.
Before he came to Essendon, Hanley played his football at South Ballarat. He was used mostly as a defender during his VFL career but also spent some time as a follower. A premiership player in both 1911 and 1912, he remained with Essendon until the conclusion of the 1914 season when he was suspended for eight matches in the penultimate game of the year. He didn't return the following season and instead join the army with whom he served overseas.
Hanley was involved in a controversial incident in 1912 when he alleged that he had been deliberately impeded by a boundary umpire. His allegation was that when he was on the boundary line competing against a Collingwood player for the ball, the umpire grasped him by the hand, thus preventing him from taking part in the contest. The umpire was not punished due to a lack of witnesses.

Kyaa Hoga Nimmo Kaa

Kyaa Hoga Nimmo Kaa was an Indian soap opera that combined family comedy (initially but twisted) and drama. The show used to air on STAR One every Monday to Thursday at 4:30pm. Initially a related show titled "Krimson Skies" was to air but nothing came of it.
Story.
The amar popular soap "Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka" is a romantic comedy based on Nimmo, a girl from a typical middle-class family and the twists and turns in her life. Luck has never favored this sweet and charming girl and she is often found to end up in circumstances which create much havoc. She still managed to remain fun-loving, confident and always had a positive approach towards life. Nimmo is very content and satisfied with whatever she does in life and whatever she has with herself. She shares a very strange relationship with God and together they share an extremely complex understanding. She is often found to be conversing with God and blaming Him for whatever happens in her life. 
The pretty young protagonist seems to accept her hard luck with high spirits until "Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka" takes a major turn and she falls in love with Vikrant (played by Sanjit Bedi) who seems to be more interested in her sister. Meanwhile Nimmo happens to meet Kunal Sehgal. Kunal (played by small-screen heartthrob Eijaz Khan) is from a very well-to-do family and is a complete playboy by reputation. 
A contractual marriage bonds them to each other and her life takes a complete turn when she is married to him. This turn is not only a surprise to her family but also to everyone else except Kanta Masi who is her confidante. But there is more to this marriage than that meets the eye. Ultimately Nimmo, with her poise and conduct, is able to manage everyone in the Sehgal household. Kunal's love interest Natasha becomes a major issue and Nimmo shifts away. It was late for Kunal to realize that he has fallen in love with Nimmo, but he manages to woo her back.
Reception.
This soap created waves on the STAR One channel and the viewers simply loved the program and accepted it with much adoration, which in turn resulted in soaring popularity and increasing TRPs.
The serial was completely based on the Cinderella theme and was appreciated by viewers of all age groups. The audiences expect that again such a sweet romantic comedy would be aired on the channel so that everyone can sit back and enjoy.

Scott Richmond

Scott Daniel Richmond (born August 30, 1979) is a Canadian professional baseball pitcher for the Texas Rangers organization. He played for the Toronto Blue Jays in parts of four seasons.
College, Independent, and Minor League career.
Richmond's high school did not offer baseball, and he played amateur summer baseball throughout western Canada, supporting himself by working on the Vancouver dockyards. He attended Missouri Valley College for one year, and played for the school's NAIA-level baseball team. He then moved to Bossier Parish Community College in Louisiana for one year, again playing for the baseball team. He transferred to Oklahoma State University, where he was an honorable mention All-Star in the Big 12 conference for the Cowboys in 2005, his final season, but went undrafted after college, as he was already 25 years of age.
He then joined the independent Northern League, where he played three seasons for the Edmonton Cracker-Cats. He struggled in his first season with Edmonton (1–4 record with 4 saves and a 6.25 ERA) in 2005. In 2006, he was 3–7 with 8 saves and a 3.03 ERA, striking out 72 while walking only 17 in 71 innings and allowing just 53 hits. He led Edmonton in ERA, and had he qualified with enough innings pitched, he would have ranked 4th in the Northern League. Richmond moved to the starting rotation in 2007, where he had a 10–9 record and a 4.26 ERA. The rest of the staff was just 28–49, as Richmond led his team in wins. He was 10th in the Northern League in ERA, and was the pitcher of the year for Edmonton. After his contract expired, he was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays, after impressing scouts in an open tryout.
In 2008, Richmond signed a minor league contract with the Blue Jays. He had a 4.29 ERA and 115/36 K/BB ratio in 121 innings with 21 starts between the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats and the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs.
MLB career.
2008.
He made his first major league start on July 30, 2008, against the Tampa Bay Rays, and was the pitcher of record in a 3–2 loss. He went 5 innings, allowing all 3 runs on 7 hits. After losing two of his first three starts with one no-decision, Richmond was demoted to Triple-A. He was called up again on September 2, and won his first career game at Baltimore on September 26. He finished the season with a 1–3 record and a 4.00 ERA in 27 innings pitched.
He did not play for Team Canada in the Beijing Olympics due to his call up to the Blue Jays.
2009.
Richmond was selected as a starting pitcher for Team Canada at the World Baseball Classic, but did not get to play. He was a starter at the Major League level for the Blue Jays for his first full season, due to injuries to Shaun Marcum and Dustin McGowan. In the month of April, Richmond went 3–0, allowing 7 earned runs, 20 strikeouts with a 2.70 ERA over 23.1 innings pitched. His strong performance played an important role in keeping Toronto in first place for the month of April. Richmond was honored by Major League Baseball for his strong April, winning the Rookie of the Month award for the American League.
As the Jays' fifth starter for 2009, Richmond, through the third week of June, had also made three bullpen appearances on occasions when scheduled off-days removed the need for a fifth starter and when the Jays' relief corps was overworked. Due to a multitude of injuries to Jays' pitchers, Richmond through the third week of June remained the only Jays' starter who had been in the rotation since the start of the season. He set a career high with 11 strikeouts against the Philadelphia Phillies, pitching 8 innings in a 7–1 win on June 17.
On July 4, Richmond was put on the DL for the first time in his career with shoulder tendinitis.
2010–2014.
Richmond started his comeback in June 2010 with the Single-A Dunedin Blue Jays. He worked his way up through the system, pitching at three different levels, finishing up with the Las Vegas 51s in September. He opened the 2011 season with the Blue Jays, appearing in one game on April 10 before being optioned back to Las Vegas.
On July 23, 2011, Richmond was outrighted to Triple-A, after previously being designated for assignment.
Richmond was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas on June 25, 2012, following an injury to pitcher Henderson Alvarez. Richmond was optioned back to Triple-A Las Vegas 51s on July 5. He was designated for assignment on August 10. On August 13, the Blue Jays outrighted Richmond to their Triple-A affiliate Las Vegas 51s. On October 4, 2012, Richmond elected for free agency.
Richmond signed with the Lotte Giants in the Korean Baseball Organization for 2013. On May 15, Richmond agreed to a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers. He spent the remainder of the season with the Triple-A Round Rock Express. On November 5, he became a free agent.
On February 22, 2014, Richmond signed another minor league contract with the Rangers.

Pony Penning

Pony Penning is an annual event held in Chincoteague, Virginia on the last consecutive Wednesday and Thursday in July. The Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department conducts the event and it consists of a Wild Pony Swim on Wednesday and a Pony Auction on Thursday. For the Wild Pony Swim, Salt Water Cowboys round up feral Chincoteague Ponies from Assateague Island and drive them across the Assateague Channel to Veteran’s Memorial Park on Chincoteague Island. The ponies swim across the channel during slack tide, when the water has minimal tidal movement. Once on Chincoteague Island, the salt water cowboys herd the ponies to pens on the Chincoteague Carnival Grounds where some of the foals are auctioned off on Thursday.
This traditional event in its current form has taken place since 1925 to raise money for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department, but its roots date back to the 17th century. The event was popularized by the book Misty of Chincoteague by Marguerite Henry published in 1947 and it now usually draws from 40,000 to 50,000 spectators.

Woody Dines Out is the 14th animated cartoon short subject in the "Woody Woodpecker" series. Released theatrically on April 1, 1945, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the final wartime Woody Woodpecker short released a month before V-E Day and 4 months before V-J Day.
Plot.
Woody walks about town and realizes that all of the restaurants are closed. He finds one store with a sign in its window that reads: "We stuff birds." He assumes that it is a restaurant when it is actually a taxidermist's shop. He approaches the counter to place his order. From his coat pocket, the taxidermist, an anthropomorphic cat (voice by Hans Conried), removes an ad from the Museum of Natural History announcing a $100,000 reward for a stuffed king-size woodpecker. He secretly places knock-out drops in the food he prepares for Woody. The food puts Woody to sleep, but he recovers on the cutting table. He escapes the taxidermist by climbing onto an elevator; the taxidermist falls down the elevator shaft to the basement, where he abandons his $100 grand ambition.

Fatima Kuinova

Fatima Kuinova (born on December 28, 1920) is a Bukharan Jewish Shashmakom singer. She was named "Merited Artist of the Soviet Union".
Kuinova was born in Samarqand, Uzbek SSR, but moved to Stalinabad, Tajik SSR with her seven brothers and two sisters when she was thirteen years old, after their father was jailed and murdered by the Soviet government for his mercantile prosperity. Her family were Bukharian Jews, and their last name was originally Cohen, but Fatima changed it to Kuinova to escape the persecution Jews faced under Stalin. During her childhood, she knew the famous Mullodzhanov family and was a friend to Shoista Mullojonova. Fatima was raised in Central Asia under Stalin's Soviet regime and spoke Russian, but she also learned Bukhori, which is a dialect of the Persian Tajiki language. Her father was the cantor of the Bukharian Jewish synagogue and taught Fatima the music of her Bukharian Jewish heritage. Kuinova began singing in different festivals at a young age. She also sang for Joseph Stalin, who was ignorant of her Jewish faith.
Fatima became famous after performing for the soldiers during World War II. In 1948, she was named "Honored Artist of the Soviet Union". Both Fatima and Shoista were soloists in the Tajik Ensemble "Rubobistok" that performed on television and radio throughout the Tajik SSR, Central Asia and the USSR and traveled to sing in areas like Kiev, Leningrad, and Moscow. She also went on tours to Europe, Afghanistan, and Iran, where she sang for the Shah.
She immigrated to Queens, New York, USA in 1980 and settled in Rego Park, where she founded and was the lead vocalist for the Shashmaqom Music of the Bukharan Jews Ensemble. In Queens, Fatima works with the Bukharian Jewish musical community and performs in numerous cultural and folk events in New York City.

Paroa, West Coast

Paroa is a settlement on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, just south of Greymouth. State Highway 6 and the Hokitika Branch railway both run through Paroa. This railway was originally a bush tramway that opened to Paroa from Greymouth in 1867 and was extended to Kumara in 1877. It was converted into a railway in 1893, and this time, ran from Paroa to Hokitika rather than Kumara.
Shantytown, to the south-east of Paroa, is a recreation of a typical 1880s West Coast gold mining town, built in 1971 and operating as a commercial tourist attraction.

He was named to the 1993 All Atlantic Division Team. He played for the Bays through at least the 1994-1995 USISL indoor season. In 1997, he played for the Bays during the USISL indoor season.
Coach.
Mount St. Mary's University.
In 1993, Mount St. Mary's University hired Mettrick as an assistant to the men’s soccer team. In 1994, he moved up to the head coaching position. In his six seasons as head coach, he took Mount St. Mary’s to a 57-42-12 record.
Loyola College in Maryland.
In 2000, Loyola College in Maryland hired Mettrick as its head soccer coach, replacing the veteran Bill Sento, who had been at the helm for two decades.
2000-2002.
Mettrick's first three seasons at the Evergreen were quite successful. In 2000, he took advantage of a team that was largely intact from the 1999 season, adding only Scottish central defender Niall Lepper to the starting lineup, and led Loyola to its first national ranking since 1997. Despite a slow start in 2001 after a loss and a tie in a season-opening tournament in California, Loyola went onto a 19 game unbeaten streak before losing to Saint Louis in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Division I Tournament, relying primarily on the strength of its defense led by Lepper and three-time regional All-America goalkeeper Reb Beatty. Loyola ended the 2001 campaign with a record of 17-2-2, including victories over nationally ranked Maryland (twice), Fairfield, and American, and finished ranked in the Top 10 in the nation. Mettrick was named the NSCAA South Atlantic Region Coach of the Year. Mettrick continued this success into the 2002 season; despite losing six starters, the core of the team in Lepper and Beatty returned and led Mettrick's gang to a 13-5-3 record and another birth in the NCAA Tournament before falling to Furman.
2003-2006.
The 2003 season was Mettrick's first with a team based solely on his recruits; from 2000 to 2002, the majority of the starting lineup consisted of players that had been recruited by Bill Sento. Further complicating matters was the loss of Beatty and Lepper - Loyola's two best players - due to graduation. Loyola was able to reach the MAAC Championship game in 2003 but was defeated in the final by Saint Peter's, starting a streak of four consecutive years without an MAAC championship. This streak included losing seasons in both 2005 and 2006.
2007-present.
Under pressure to turn things around, Mettrick took the best pieces of his 2006 team and added several new recruits, leading to an incredible change of fortune. In both 2007 and 2008 he coached the Greyhounds into the NCAA Tournament, reaching the second round both years. In 2008 he was awarded the NSCAA/Adidas Coach of the Year award for the North Atlantic Region after leading the team to an undefeated regular season in the MAAC. The Greyhounds reached the NCAA College Cup for a school Division I record third-straight season in 2009. Loyola then finished with a 9-7-2 record in 2010.

"Amor a la Mexicana" (Love, Mexican-Style) is the title of a song written by Mario Puparro, produced by Emilio Estefan Jr. and recorded by Thalía. It was the first single from her fifth studio album of the same title. Cuca's Fiesta Mix was released in Europe as a single. 
Music video.
Three videos were made for the song. For the original version and for 2 remixes. The first music video was directed by Benny Corral and released in July 1997. It is mostly shot in a Mexican "casa" where Thalia walks around, sleeps in various places (a hammock, a large bed and a chair) and interacts with various typically Mexican props (such as a sombrero and several cacti). A number of shirtless men also feature prominently. The remixes videos were released in 1998 and feature Thalia as the sales clerk at a truck stop in the Mexican desert. Thalia alternates between flirting with the various men who drop by, and performing a choreographed routine with several other dancers.

Johan Hagemeyer

Johan Hagemeyer (1 June 1884, Amsterdam, the Netherlands - 1962, Berkeley, California USA) was a Dutch born horticulturalist and vegetarian who is remembered primarily for being an early 20th-century photographer and artistic intellectual. His family came to California to grow fruit trees, but in 1916 he met photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who convinced him to devote his life to the then emerging world of artistic photography. In 1923 Hagemeyer opened a portrait studio in San Francisco and also built a summer studio in Carmel, California which soon became a meeting place for artists and intellectuals.
It was there that he met Edward Weston, who encouraged Hagemeyer to further his career in photography. Hagemeyer soon developed his own style, and from the 20s through the 40s he photographed leading figures of the day, including Albert Einstein and Salvador Dalí. However, he sometimes retouched or manipulated his photos, which went against the beliefs of Weston. His refusal to adhere to Weston's views was a major cause in a growing alienation of the two men. When Weston, Ansel Adams and others founded Group f/64, devoted to straight, unmanipulated photography, Hagemeyer did not join. Perhaps because of his determination to go his own way or perhaps because his style was never fully appreciated, he never came close to achieving the fame of his former friends. In 1947 he left Carmel and returned to San Francisco full-time. He died poor and virtually forgotten at age 78.
The Johan Hagemeyer Photograph Collection at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley, contains the approximately 6,785 photographic prints and negatives which made up the photographer's personal archive at the time of his death in 1962. A smaller collection of prints, negatives and correspondence is at the Center for Creative Photography (CCP) in Tucson, Arizona, and the CCP has released a digital catalog of Hagemeyer's photograph collection.

<doc id="18627354" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18627354" title="Khitan (circumcision)">
Khitan (circumcision)

Khitān () or Khatna () is the term for male circumcision carried out as an Islamic rite. It is considered by some as a sign of belonging or introduction to the wider Islamic community. "Khitan", in some of parts of the world such as Indonesia and Malaysia, may also refer to the circumcision of the female (properly "khafḍ").
Islamic male circumcision is analogous to Jewish circumcision, although there are a number of key differences. Islam is currently the largest single religious group in which the practice is widespread, and although circumcision is not mentioned in the Qur'an, it is contained in the hadith as well as in the sunnah. Whether or not it should be carried out after converting to Islam is debated among Islamic scholars.
Religious sources.
The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. In the time of Muhammad, circumcision of both sexes was carried out by most pagan Arabian tribes, and male circumcision among Jews and Christians for religious reasons. This has also been attested by Al-Jahiz, as well as by Josephus.
According to some traditions Muhammad was born without a foreskin (aposthetic), while others maintain that his grandfather Abd-al-Muttalib circumcised him when he was seven days old.
Many of his early disciples were circumcised to symbolize their inclusion within the emerging Islamic community. Some accounts report that Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium, had referred to Muhammad as the "leader of the circumcised people".
Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as "fitra" (acts considered to be of a refined person). Abu Hurayra, a companion of the Prophet, was quoted saying, "Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits" (reported in the "hadiths" of Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a religious custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other "hadiths" which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of "fitra" and yet another "hadith" which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted "The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using the tooth-stick, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving the pubes and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth." Hence, the different hadiths do not correspond on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not.
Prophet's wife Aisha supposedly quotes Muhammad as saying that ""ablution becomes necessary if the two circumcised members touch"".
Furthermore, prophet is reported to have once advised a female circumciser not to cut off the entire clitoris during female circumcision.
According to some "hadith" Muhammad supposedly circumcised his grandsons Hasan and Husayn on the seventh day after their birth.
Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim also quote from Muhammad that Prophet Abraham performed his own circumcision at the age of eighty. It is also reported by Abu Dawud and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal that Muhammad stated that circumcision was a "law for men and a preservation of honor for women".
Circumcision was introduced to many lands for the first time through Islam itself following the Muslim conquests under the Rashidun, who were the companions and contemporaries of Muhammad. An example are the Persians who did not practice circumcision before the advent of Islam. Post-Islamic converts such as Afshin were found guilty in trials of remaining uncircumcised, this further indicates that the practice was deemed compulsory by the early Muslims.
Sunni Islam.
Amongst "Ulema" (Muslim legal scholars), there are differing opinions about the compulsion of circumcision in "Sharia" (Islamic law). Imams Abū Ḥanīfa, founder of the Hanafi school of "Fiqh" (Islamic jurisprudence), and Malik ibn Anas, maintain that circumcision is a "Sunnah Mu'akkadah"—not obligatory but highly recommended. The Shafi`i and Hanbali schools see it as binding on all Muslims.
Shia Islam.
Most Shia traditions regard the practice as obligatory. They rely on sayings that come from classical Shia authors. In one narration Muhammad was asked if an uncircumcised man could go to pilgrimage. He answered ""not as long as he is not circumcised"". They quote Ali as saying: ""If a man becomes Muslim, he must submit to circumcision even if he is 80 years old"". Another narration from Al-Sadiq says: ""Circumcise your sons when they are seven days old as it is cleaner (athar) and the flesh grows faster and because the earth hates the urine of the uncircumcised"". It is also believed that the urine of the uncircumcised is impure, while if one prays with unclean genitals their prayer may not be considered as acceptable, even of those who have been circumcised, meaning that it may have to be repeated again at a time when the believer has purified themselves and removed the impurity. Another hadith of Muhammad states: ""the earth cries out to God in anguish because of the urine of the uncircumcised"", and that ""the earth becomes defiled from the urine of the uncircumcised for forty days"".
Quranists.
There is a Quran alone movement within Islam that rejects making male circumcision a religious requirement due to the fact it is not mentioned in any verse in the Qur'an. At the same time the Qur'an is supposed to explain all things (Qur'an 12:111). Advocates of this view point above this to several Qur'anic verses that indicate the perfection of creation by Allah (, , , 23:14, 27:88, 80:17-19, 31:20 amongst others). 32:6-7: ""That is the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Exalted in Might, the Merciful, Who perfected everything which He created and began the creation of man from clay."" 31:20 ""Do you not see that Allah has made subject to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and amply bestowed upon you His favors, apparent and unapparent? But of the people is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening Book [from Him."" Another verse warns how Satan will mislead believers so that they will want to change Allah's creation ... ""Whom Allah has cursed. For he [Satan had said, "I will surely take from among Your servants a specific portion. And I will mislead them, and I will arouse in them desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle, and I will command them so they will change the creation of Allah ." And whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of Allah has certainly sustained a clear loss.""
Muslim activists include Canadian Dr. Arif Bhimji, Libyan judge Mustafa Kamal al-Mahdawi, and the Egyptian feminist Dr. Nawal El Saadawi, who links it with her own struggle against female genital mutilation. Some Quranists claim circumcision is haram, claiming that suras such as forbids altering one's body, and suras such as which says man was created perfectly. Also there is report from the days of the early khaliffat regarding circumcision that after the conversion of many people meant that revenues from the Jizya payment stopped, Jarrah the governor in Khurasan, advised that circumcision be adopted as the religious test for true acceptance of Islam. However, Khalifa Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (rahimahullah) replied in a letter: "Allah sent Muhammad (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) to summon men Islam and not to circumcise." 
Time for circumcision.
Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. It depends on family, region and country. A majority of Ulema however take the view that parents should get their child circumcised before the age of ten. The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of puberty.
Procedure.
Whereas Jewish circumcision is closely bound by ritual timing and tradition, Islamic circumcision does not have a strictly mandated procedure or form of circumcision. Whether or not boys get circumcised and the procedure tend to change across cultures, families, and time. In some Islamic countries, circumcision is performed after Muslim boys have learned to recite the whole Qur'an from start to finish. In Malaysia and other regions, the boy usually undergoes the operation between the ages of ten and twelve, and is thus a puberty rite, serving to introduce him into the new status of an adult. The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity.
Traditional circumcisions however are steadily becoming rarer throughout the Islamic world, with many Muslim families preferring to have their sons circumcised at birth, or if it is done at an older age it is normally done by a doctor under local anesthetic. There is no equivalent of a Jewish mohel in Islam. Circumcisions are usually carried out in a clinic or hospital. The circumciser is not required to be a Muslim. The "styles" of the Islamic circumcision vary. "Low and tight" along with "High and loose" seem to be the most frequently performed styles of circumcision in the Muslim world. Nevertheless, the tightness of the shaft skin along with the place of the scar may be different on every person. Also the frenulum is either intact, or removed.
Celebrations.
In Indonesia, after a child is circumcised, there is a feast called Perayaan Sunatan, but some ulemas in Indonesia say this is bid'ah whereas most of them say it is not. In Turkey also widely celebrated and called "Sunnet Toreni" "Sunnet mevludu".
Related concepts.
"Khafḍ" or "k̲h̲ifāḍ", is related to Khitan, and refers to the practice of circumcision in female. Female circumcision is sometimes also referred to as "khitan". In many Muslim communities of the world, "khafd" is a rite of passage and refers to excision of the female genital organs. Over 125 million women, primarily in Africa, Middle East and Muslim populations of Southeast Asia and South Asia are currently known to undergone female circumcision, with Egypt recording the highest number of "khafd" women in the world.
