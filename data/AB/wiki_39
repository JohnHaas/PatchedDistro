Logan, Montana

Logan is an unincorporated community in Gallatin County, Montana, United States.
History.
Logan is situated on the Gallatin River and was established in 1889 as a railroad station on the Northern Pacific and Montana (later the Northern Pacific Railway). (Logan is located on today's Montana Rail Link.)
During construction period the settlement was referred to as Canyon House, due to a house of that name which was here at that time. The name of Logan was adopted on November 26, 1889. The name is in honor of Captain William Logan, who came to Montana in 1872, taking part in General Baker’s campaign against the Indians in 1872 to 1876.
In 1877, Captain Logan accompanied General Gibbon on the expedition which resulted in the Battle of the Big Hole on August 9, 1877, where he met his death. His wife’s name as Miss Odelia Furlong.
It is noted that right-of-way of the Northern Pacific here was acquired from Odelia Logan. The owners of the town site were William D. Flowers and Mary E. Flowers. Their certificate is dated October 20, 1892. The plat was filed on June 10, 1893.
Logan was an important junction on the Northern Pacific's Rocky Mountain Division, where westbound trains could diverge north to the line to Helena, Montana and Mullan Pass, or south to Butte, Montana, via Homestake Pass. In addition, the Northern Pacific operated a secondary freight-only line between Logan and Bozeman, Montana from the 1920s through the 1950s. This was eventually made redundant by the use of diesel locomotives such as the EMD FT on the Northern Pacific and the alternate route was subsequently removed.
Until the 1930s Logan was home to a six-stall roundhouse, as well as coal and water facilities which supported the Northern Pacific's steam locomotives. The roundhouse burned down in a fire in December, 1932, destroying or damaging at least three steam locomotives. Photographs of this event can be seen in the Ronald V. Nixon Collection at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman.
The call letters for Logan's telegraph office were "CH". It was located approximately 1,120 miles from the NP's terminus in St. Paul, Minnesota. Its elevation is 4,087 feet.

1923 Chatham Cup

The 1923 Chatham Cup was the first annual nationwide football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with separate northern and southern tournaments, with the winners of the two meeting in the final. Very few teams entered the competition, including only two from the southern South Island; Seacliff easily won the only match played there, thumping Oamaru 7-0, and repeated this in the final, accounting for Wellington's YMCA 4-0.
Of the teams taking part, it is known that four were from Wellington; contemporary reports indicate that Diamonds, Hospital, YMCA, and Waterside took part. There is some suggestion that the Auckland regional winners, Northcote required a play-off against North Shore United to progress. There is some confusion as to the spelling of the name of the champion Manawatu side, it being listed in various publications as either Daubers or Dawbers, and either with or without an apostrophe.
There is some confusion about the earlier rounds of the competition, with various Charity Cups being held to decide entrants to the Chatham Cup, and with regional qualification finals, island finals, and the national final all simply being referred to in contemporary reports as "finals". Compounding this, different regional football associations were allowed to choose their champion team by whatever method they liked, meaning that some regions (such as Auckland) used league position to determine their entrant for the inter-regional matches, rather than a knockout competition. Compounding matters further are the incomplete records held by the NZFA, which omit several matches (including the semi-final between Seacliff and Oamaru Rangers).
The 1923 final.
In the final, YMCA had the better of early possession, but Seacliff gained the upper hand as the match progressed. Centre-forward Bill Hooper scored the first goal just before the half-time interval. Shortly after the break Reg Baxter doubled the lead. Late on right wing Malcolm McDougall scored again, followed only a minute later by a second from Hooper. The line-up of the first Chatham Cup winning side was as follows: Charlie Rivers, Jock Anderson, George Anderson, Bill Rogers, Hugh McKechnie, Bill Murray, Malcolm McDougall, Reg Baxter, Bill Hooper, R. "Tommy" Burns, Wattie Hanlin.

Gawron-class corvette

The Gawron class () or Projekt 621 was a planned class of multipurpose corvettes ordered by Polish Navy. The Gawron class was a variant of the MEKO A-100 project developed by the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Germany. Construction of the first ship of the class started in 2001. The project was terminated in February 2012 but in October 2013 a contract was signed to complete the existing hull as a patrol ship by 2016.
Construction.
There were plans to build 7 Gawron-class corvettes, but as of 2009, work has only begun on one ship, which is to be named "Ślązak" (). The program suffered delays due to insufficient funding from the government and delays in choosing final weapons and systems configuration. The hull was launched on 16 September 2009, but the program was suspended due to the ongoing financial crisis. The Work was resumed and the first ship would be commissioned by 2015. However on 24 February 2012 it as announced by the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk that the project was cancelled.
At the time of the cancellation, the hull of the first ship was largely completed at the cost of 402 million PLN (~US$130m), but equipping it would have cost an additional 1 billion PLN (~US$320m). A single existing "Gawron" hull will be completed without fire-control system and main armament as heavy patrol vessel at the cost of 100 million PLN.

Bruce E. Cain

Bruce E. Cain is a Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and Director Designate of the Bill Lane Center for the American West. Professor Cain’s fields of interest include American politics, political regulation, democratic theory, and state and local government. He has written extensively on elections, legislative representation, California politics, redistricting, and political regulation. In addition to his academic work, Cain frequently is quoted in national and international media, and regularly appears as a political expert for KGO-TV in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is a member of the American Political Science Association, and serves on the editorial boards of Election Law Journal and American Politics Research. Professor Cain has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2000. During AY 2012-13, Cain will serve as a Straus Fellow at New York University's Straus Institute for the Advanced Study of Law and Justice.
Education.
Cain graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bowdoin College in 1970 and studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Trinity College, Oxford. In 1976, he received his Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University.
Career.
Upon completion of his PhD, Cain began his academic career at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1976. His work as an assistant and associate professor focused on comparisons of British and American governance systems, representation and redistricting. Additionally, during his 14 years at Caltech, Cain held numerous leadership roles on academic administration committees, ranging from admissions and academic standards to the faculty board. 
In 1981, while on leave from the university, Cain served as a special consultant to the California Assembly Special Committee on Reapportionment. Working with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Cain’s work on California’s redistricting was the first effort to employ satellite maps and computer programming in the apportionment process prior to the creation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). His work in the early 1980s ultimately led to the creation of the statewide database. This public data enterprise is now housed under the Berkeley School of Law, and continues to be the primary warehouse for redistricting information and data in California. 
In 1989, Cain joined the faculty of what is now named The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science at University of California at Berkeley. From 1995 to 2006, Cain was appointed the Robson Professor of Political Science, and served as the Heller Professor of Political Science from 2007-2012. 
Under the direction of Nelson W. Polsby, Cain served as the Associate Director of the Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) from 1989-1999 and as its Director from 1999-2007. The Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) is an interdisciplinary organized research unit (ORU) at UC Berkeley. Founded in 1919, IGS and its affiliated centers spearhead and promote research, programs, seminars and colloquia, training, educational activities, and public service in the fields of politics and public policy, with a strong focus on national and California politics. 
Between September 2005 - June 2012, Cain served as the Executive Director of the University of California’s Washington Center, “a multi-campus residential, instructional and research center that provides students and faculty from the University of California with opportunities to research, work, study and live within rich cultural, political and international heritage of our capital city.” In addition to his administrative duties as director, Professor Cain taught undergraduate seminars on the Congress, political reform and research methodology.
Contributions to Political Science.
Bruce Cain was one of early contributors to the now burgeoning field of Election Law and Political Regulation. Since Baker v Carr (1962), the courts have been drawn into deciding disputes over political reforms related to redistricting, term limits, party primaries, campaign finance, direct democracy and election administration. Many of Cain’s empirical studies show that political reforms rarely achieve all that they promise because of adaptive behavior by those being regulated and because there is typically more consensus about the problems than the solutions. His work has demonstrated that terms limits, for instance, have not reduced partisanship or increased the quality of state legislatures, that redistricting reform has been frustrated by the inability to define what fairness is, and that campaign finance regulation is hindered by being necessarily ex post facto. His most recent studies have focused on devising a more realistic and coherent theory of political reform. 
Awards.
Throughout his career, Cain has been recognized for not only his distinguished research, but also for his commitment to mentoring both undergraduate and graduate students. In 1988, he was a co-winner of the Richard F. Fenno Prize for the best legislative studies book along with J. A. Ferejohn and M. Fiorina. In 1988, he received the Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology Award for Excellence in Teaching. In 2000, Stanford University awarded him the Zale Award for Outstanding Achievement in Policy Research and Public Service. In 2003, UC Berkeley recognized Professor Cain for Distinguished Mentoring of Undergraduates. Also in 2003, the American Political Science Association and Pi Sigma Alpha, the National Political Science Honor Society, honored Cain for outstanding teaching in political science. 
Media.
Beginning in 1984, Cain has been an election commentator for every race in California both on the radio and on television. He served as a consultant to the Los Angeles Times from 1986-88 and was the political analyst on Mornings on Two, KTVU from 1998-2006. He is a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and currently appears as a regular political analyst for KGO-TV. 
Government and Political Consulting.
He served as a polling consultant for state and senate races to Fairbank, Canapary and Maulin from 1985 to 1986. Cain’s expertise has led him to work as a redistricting consultant to several government agencies, including: the Los Angeles City Council (1986), Los Angeles County (1991), the Oakland City Council (1993), the City of San Diego (2001), the City and County of San Francisco (2002), the Attorney General of Maryland (2011), the Attorney General of Massachusetts (1987-88), and the U.S. Justice Department (1989). He served as the Special Master to the three judge panel overseeing the Arizona State Legislative Redistricting (2002).

<doc id="18657707" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18657707" title="Passive probing">
Passive probing

Passive probing is the process of acquiring control or data from a telecommunication or data network without disturbing the network being monitored. This ensures that applications using the probed data can do so without any threat to the operation of the observed network. This is particularly important for network management/OSS applications where disturbing the observed network with active devices can itself affect network operation and destroy the value of the probed data.
Passive probing is also known as Non Intrusive Monitoring, and also can refer to oscilliscope probes.
Types of probe.
Devices performing the probing can be of several forms, largely to meet the physical and transport configuration of the network they are attaching to. Probing is possible on electrical and optical bearers through tapping, optical splitters but is also common using specialised inline devices with failsafe modes. In ethernet networks, managed switches can also offer SPAN port packet duplication, but this is generally inefficient both for the switch and the amount of data that may need to be collected.
The probes typically process the lower layers of the network protocol stacks, removing this information from the data passed on to the application. The lower layers often provide little value for the consuming application, although this is not universally true. Examples of transport layers which are typically removed include ATM, HDLC, MPLS, VLAN, MTPL2, PPP, Frame Relay. In WAN environments, Inverse Multiplexed ATM, PPP Multilink are also common.

<doc id="18657711" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18657711" title="1903 VFL Grand Final">
1903 VFL Grand Final

The 1903 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Collingwood Football Club and Fitzroy Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 12 September 1903. It was the 6th annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1903 VFL season. The match, attended by 32,263 spectators, was won by Collingwood by a margin of 2 points, marking that club's second successive premiership victory.
Gerald Brosnan had a chance to win Fitzroy the premiership with a set shot for goal off the last kick of the game but missed narrowly to give Collingwood back-to-back flags.
Collingwood's Jim Addison, despite playing in just his third game, was the only multiple goalkicker. Both Ern Jenkins and Bert Sharpe of Fitzroy were celebrating their 100th VFL games.
Lead-up.
After the home-and-away season (which lasted for seventeen matches, including the "first round" of fourteen matches and a "second round" of three matches), Collingwood was top of the ladder with a record of 15–2 and a percentage of 159.4; Fitzroy finished second with a record of 14–3 and a percentage of 171.6.
The finals were contested using the variation of the "Argus" System seen between 1902–1906. Fitzroy faced fourth-placed in the First Semi-Final, and won by 52 points, and Collingwood faced third-placed in the Second Semi-Final and won by four points. Collingwood and Fitzroy then faced off to decide the premiers.
Right to challenge.
The winner of this match would automatically win the premiership; no team had the right to challenge for the premiership this season. Under the variation of the "Argus" System in use between 1902–1906, the club with the best record in all matches (including finals) could have challenged for the premiership if it had not won this game. However, whichever team won this game would have become the team with the best record, depriving the other of any right to challenge. Entering the match, Collingwood had a record of 16–2, and Fitzroy had a record of 15–3 but a superior percentage: in the event of a Collingwood win, Collingwood's 17–2 record would have ranked above Fitzroy's 15–4; in the event of a Fitzroy win, both clubs would have been level on 16–3, and Fitzroy would have been ranked above Collingwood with a superior percentage.
This is different from the ruling which would have been used under the more widely known variation of the "Argus" System, which was in use from 1907–1930. In that variation, the team with the best record in matches "excluding" finals had the right to challenge; as Collingwood had the best record after 17 weeks, it would have retained the right to challenge, regardless of finals results.

Seacliff AFC

Seacliff AFC was a football (soccer) club based in the Otago region of New Zealand's South Island. They are notable for being the first team to win the Chatham Cup competition. They contested the final on later occasions in 1924, 1925, and 1929. Many of the team came from the staff of the Seacliff Lunatic Asylum; with the demise of the hospital in the 1940s, the team went into hiatus.
A new team using the Seacliff name formed in the early 1980s and competed in the Chatham Cup between 1990 and 1997, reaching the second round in 1994. The new team was initially largely from the staff of the Cherry Farm Hospital which had been built to replace the Seacliff institution; with the closure of this hospital, the team also soon disbanded.

The organisation was founded by the Roman Catholic priest Franz Hoffmeister as a community of traditional students. Like similar organisations in Germany, it was founded because of the experiences of World War I. During the Third Reich activities were interrupted. Specific aspects of "Heimat" — love and attachment to homeland and the rejection of anything foreign — left the idea vulnerable to easy assimilation into the fascist "blood and soil" literature of the National Socialists.

History.
On 21 March 1973 SC Grün-Weiß Schönebeck established its women's section. After playing for several years in lower leagues, Schönebeck was promoted to the Verbandsliga (III) in 1992. They played in this league until 1999 with an intermezzo in 1996–97, when the club participated for a year in the Regionalliga (II). The promotion to the Regionalliga in 1999 was followed by five years of football in that league until Schönebeck gained promotion to the Bundesliga in 2004.
In the 2002–03 season the club had struggled in the Regionalliga and the aim for the 2003–04 season was to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga, starting in the next season. They won their league though and after a successful qualification round gained promotion to the highest league in German women's football. Since Schönebeck has established itself in the Bundesliga, generally achieving mid-table results. The best result was a 5th place in 2008–09. The team has reached the German cup semi-finals in 2007 and 2010.

Thrikkunnathu Seminary

Thrikkunathu Seminary is an historic former seminary and closed church in the Thrikkunnathu neighbourhood of Aluva, Ernakulam. Owing to an ownership dispute between the Indian (Malankara) Orthodox and Jacobite Syrian Christian churches both the seminary and its Saint Mary’s Church building were closed in December 1977. The church is a pilgrimage site for Jacobite Syrian Christians in India.
St Mary's Church.
In 1880 the Malankara Church acquired of land for construction of the church and a cornerstone was laid in 1889. The church began as a small building thatched with coconut leaves which was slowly built out in the early 1900s. Paulose Mar Athanasius built the current St Mary's Church in the early 1930s. The Syriac Orthodox Church canonized him as a saint at Damascus in August 2004. Mar Athanasius both gave away and sold at very low cost much of his inherited land so that Syrian Christians settling in the area could live near the church. The western side of the building was enlarged in 1964. Inside are the tombs of three 19th and 20th century Syrian Christian metropolitan bishops, Kadavil Paulose Mar Athanasius (d 1907), Saint Paulose Mar Athanasius (d 1953) and Mor Gregorios Geevarghese Vayaliparambil (d 1966).
On the 25th and 26 January each year thousands of pilgrims gather at St Mary's Church to take part in dukrono celebrations for its builder, Saint Paulose Mar Athanasius, who has been called "one of the most revered metropolitans" of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church "after Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala."
Seminary.
A cornerstone for the seminary was laid down in 1904. An English middle school was also planned but never built. Like the newer church building, the seminary was finished and opened by Mar Athanasius in 1930-31. A dormitory for seminary students called the "Syrian Hostel" was also built nearby. In the spring of 1931 Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Elias III began a long journey of mediation throughout India by staying at the new seminary, after first calling on British officials Lord Irwin in Delhi and George Stanley at Madras.
A second floor was added in 1956. From its opening in 1931 until the 1970s Thrikkunnathu Seminary was a notable Malankara teaching facility for clergy in the northern dioceses of the Indian Orthodox Church. Throughout these decades it was also the only full seminary for Jacobite Syrian Christians and as such, later noted as the "headquarters" of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church in India.
Closing and later history.
When the Indian Orthodox Church split again Jacobite Syrian Christian Church from the in 1975, the seminary's resident metropolitan bishop had been diocesan head of the Orthodox church body since the late 1960s. The seminary building, church and grounds ownership was retained by Indian Orthodox Church. Ownership was disputed in the aftermath and two years later, on 6 December 1977 the seminary and church were closed. Indian Orthodox metropolitans still reside in the seminary building.
In 1997 Philipose Theophilose, a metropolitan of the Indian Orthodox Church, died while staying at the old seminary building and was entombed next to the church. This tomb was later rebuilt as another room of the church building itself.
Since the early 1980s Jacobite Syrian Christians in Aluva have worshipped in a rented building called "Mass Hall" not far from St Mary's Church. In 1990 the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church opened the Malankara Syrian Orthodox Seminary in new buildings about 25 kilometres south at Udayagiri, Mulanthuruthy in Ernakulam.
Mediation efforts to settle disagreements over the use of St Mary's Church have been unsuccessful. On 3 July 2005, one month and a half before the first anniversary of Mar Athanasius' canonization as a saint, local police were called to the closed church when violence broke out over the long standing ownership dispute. A government lawyer's automobile was set on fire, priests and others were reportedly hurt and there were claims of police brutality. In January 2009 the church had been closed for over 31 years when "The New Indian Express", after speaking with a spokesman for the Indian Orthodox church, reported that "the Orthodox faction was not averse to letting the faithful of both factions worship in the Church, but the top Church officials of the Jacobite faction cannot be allowed in."
In January 2006, the Hindu reported that "A meeting of various groups under the Orthodox Church on Sunday at the seminary said that they would protect the seminary property at any cost and warned that the Government would be responsible for the fall out of anyone using force to enter the seminary premises."
In January 2007, the Hindu further reported that "Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan Moran Mor Baselios Mar Thoma Didymos I, on Tuesday, warned the Government that the path of violence and non-tolerance being adopted by Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in the Thrikkunnathu Seminary row should not be taken as weakness" and "The Catholicos alleged that the Government decision permitting entry of Baselios Thomas I and other metropolitans of Jacobite Syrian Christian Church into the disputed Thrikkunnathu Seminary church was not right and he himself will act 'hideously diabolic' to stop it."

Brother Azarias

Brother Azarias (Patrick Francis Mullany) (b. near Killenaule, County Tipperary, Ireland, 29 June 1847) was an Irish-American educator, essayist, littérateur, and philosopher.
Life.
His education began at home, and after his family moved to Deerfield, New York, U.S.A., continued in the union school of that place, and subsequently in the Christian Brothers' Academy at Utica. Believing himself called to the life of a religious teacher, he entered the novitiate of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, in New York City, on 24 February 1862. 
He taught in Albany, New York City, and Philadelphia until 1866, when he was called to the professorship of mathematics and literature in Rock Hill College, Ellicott City, Maryland. Gradually his interests were absorbed by literature and philosophy, which, with pedagogy, continued to hold them until the end of his career. From 1879 to 1886 he was President of Rock Hill College. 
Then followed two years of research in European libraries, chiefly those of Paris and London. On his return to the United States, he became professor of literature in De La Salle Institute, New York City, and remained such till his death at the Catholic Summer School, Plattsburgh, 20 August 1893.
Works.
He was a frequent contributor to the "Catholic World", the "American Catholic Quarterly Review", and the "American Ecclesiastical Review", and his name appears in the files of the "Educational Review" and of the "International Journal of Ethics". His lectures include:-"The Psychological Aspects of Educations", delivered before the Regent's Convocation, University of the State of New York, 1877; "Literary and Scientific Habits of Thought", before the International Congress of Education, 1884; "Aristotle and the Christian Church", before the Concord School of Philosophy, 1885; "Church and State", before the Farmington School of Philosophy, 1890; "Religion in Education", before the New York State Teachers' Association, 1891; "Educational Epochs", before the Catholic Summer School, 1893. At the time of his death, he was engaged in preparing a "History of Education" for the International Education Series.
His first work as an independent author appeared in 1874, with the title "An Essay Contributing to a Philosophy of Literature" (seventh edition, 1899). Ernest Renan and Ralph Waldo Emerson had attempted to make literature a substitute for religion in cultured circles; Brother Azarias claims in this essay that literature draws its life and excellence from religion. 
"The Development of Old English Thought" (third edition, 1903) appeared in 1879 as the first part of a projected course in English literature, which, however, was never completed. The author begins with sketching the "continental homestead" which was written for the "Ave Maria". After his death many of this contributions to reviews were gathered and published in three volumes, viz. "Essays Educational", "Essays philosophical", and "Essays Miscellaneous" (1896). of the English; he then contrasts the Celt and Teuton, examines the pagan traditions on which Christian literature was engrafted, and concludes with pen pictures of Hilda, Caedmon, Benedict Biscop, and the Venerable Bede. The period covered is the first thousand years of the Christian era.
"Aristotle and the Christian Church" (London and New York, 1888) sets forth the attitude of the Catholic Church towards Aristotelean philosophy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
"Books and Reading" (seventh edition, New York, 1904) was originally a reprint of two lectures delivered before the Cathedral Library Reading Circle of New York City, 1899). It attempts to make literature in general, and Catholic literature in particular, a living force for those even who have not received the benefits of higher education.
"Phases of Thought and Criticism" (1892) contrasts first Cardinal Newman and Emerson as typical thinkers, and then the "habits of thought engendered by literary pursuits and those begotten of scientific studies." 
His minor works include "Mary, Queen of May", The first of these includes the lectures delivered at the Catholic Summer School, just before his death; the second reprints the lecture on "Aristotle and the Christian Church", adding "Nature and Synthetic Principle of Philosophy", the "Symbolism of the Cosmos", "Psychological Aspects of Education" and "Ethical Aspects of the Papal Encyclical on Capital and Labor".

A Retrieved Reformation

"A Retrieved Reformation" is a short story by American author O. Henry first published in "The Cosmopolitan Magazine", April 1903. It describes the events which lead up to the reformation of an ex-convict. The story was adapted into the film, "Alias Jimmy Valentine" in 1928, MGM's first all-talking film. The popularity of the story as a motion picture added greatly to the author's vogue, though in the English, French, and Spanish versions O. Henry's name was not mentioned. The character of Jimmy Valentine is taken from life but there is a close parallel to the leading incident in chapter XLII of Hugo's "Les Miserables". 
Story.
Safecracker Jimmy Valentine is released from prison after serving less than 10 months of a four year sentence, due to his criminal connections. He goes to his old apartment, packs up his tools, and leaves. In the following weeks, a few cash robberies are committed, and the detective who landed Valentine in jail in the first place, Ben Price, is called to work on the new case. He realizes that the robberies are committed in Jimmy's style.
Valentine shows up sometime later in Elmore, Arkansas. He goes to the town bank with the intention of checking it over before robbing it. However, as he walks to the hotel, he catches the eye of the banker's beautiful daughter, Annabel Adams. He falls in love with her immediately, and Valentine decides to give up his criminal career. He moves into the town, taking up the identity of Ralph D. Spencer, a shoemaker. 
At the end of the year, Jimmy has risen socially and business-wise and has become engaged to Annabel. Two weeks before the wedding, he writes a letter to a friend, telling the friend to pick up the safe-cracker's tools that Valentine won't need anymore.
By this time, however, Price has tracked him down and shows up at the bank while Jimmy and Annabel's family are inside. Carrying the tool case, Jimmy watches as Annabel's father shows them the bank's new safe. Annabel's nieces are fascinated by it, and as they are playing, one accidentally shuts the other inside and locks the door, without the time lock's clock having been wound nor any combination set. Everyone panics, and Annabel begs Jimmy to do something. Jimmy, knowing that it will reveal his true identity, uses his case of tools to open the door and save the child. Unbeknownst to Valentine at that time, Price has witnessed the whole incident.
Valentine starts to leave the bank afterwards, and he sees Price standing by the door. Sheepishly, he gives himself up, but much to his surprise, Price pretends not to recognize him and walks away.

Michael Ralph Fellows (born June 15, 1952 in Upland, California) is an American computer scientist and Professor at Charles Darwin University, Australia, and Director of the Parameterized Complexity Research Unit (PCRU).
Biography.
Mike Fellows received his M.A., Mathematics in Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1982 and in 1985 his Ph.D. with the dissertation "Encoding Graphs in Graphs".
Fellows is professor at Charles Darwin University, Australia, and Director of the Parameterized Complexity Research Unit (PCRU). 
He has taught in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. In 2007, Fellows was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt Research Award. His German host was Rolf Niedermeier and Mike spent part of 2007 and most of 2008 at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität in Jena, Germany, working with Rolf Niedermeier. Also in 2007, Mike became one of the first Fellows of the Institute of Advanced Study (Durham), UK and a Fellow of Grey College at the University of Durham. Also he was awarded an Australian Research Council Professorial Fellowship for five years, beginning 2010.
He is an Area Editor for the "Journal of Computer and System Sciences" since 2004, and Advising Editor for the special Section on Parameterized Complexity in the "Journal of Computer and System Sciences". He is Associate Editor for ACM Transactions on Algorithms. In 2008 was Guest Editor for a special double issue of "The Computer Journal" with 15 surveys on Parameterized Complexity.

In 1999, he married Frances Novak Rosamond, also a scientist, who shares his love of mathematics and adventure.
Work.
Fellows is recognized as one of the founders of parameterized complexity, a complexity framework that uses structure in hard problems for the design and analysis of algorithms for their solution. Parameterized complexity has strong connections to algorithmic engineering, and is increasingly important in fields as diverse as Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, and Bioinformatics. Fellows is also known for his innovative science communication.
Computer Science Unplugged!
Fellow's books "Computer Science Unplugged!" written with Tim Bell and Ian Witten, and "This is MEGA-Mathematics!", with Nancy Casey convey sophisticated concepts such as intractability, sorting networks, and cryptography. They have won several science popularization awards, and been translated into languages including Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, and German, with more translations underway. 
"Unplugged!" was part of the famous British Fraraday Christmas Lectures in 2008, which was given by Professor Christopher M. Bishop of UK Microsoft Research.
Passion plays about mathematics.
Fellows is also the author of several passion plays about mathematics, with mathematical proofs enacted on-stage, which were performed at the Fringe Theatre in British Columbia.

Eupatorium leucolepis

Eupatorium leucolepis, commonly called Justiceweed or white-bracted thoroughwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant in Asteraceae native from the eastern coastal states of the USA, from New York to Texas.
"Eupatorium paludicola" and "Eupatorium novae-angliae".
"Eupatorium paludicola" consists of diploids from clay soils of North Carolina and South Carolina. Until the early 21st century, they were classified in "E. leucolepis". "Eupatorium novae-angliae", known from a dozen or so sites in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, is a hybrid-derived allopolyploid of "Eupatorium paludicola" and "Eupatorium perfoliatum". In the past it was known as "E. leucolepis" var. "novae-angliae" but, like "E. paludicola", it does not appear to be closely related to "E. leucolepis".
It is self-sustaining, rather than being found only where both parents are present, so various authors since 1992 have proposed treating it as a distinct species.

Wildlife of Bhutan

The Kingdom of Bhutan is a small, landlocked nation nestled in the southern slopes of the Eastern Himalaya. To its north lies the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and to the west, south and east lies the Indian states of Sikkim, Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.
The terrain is some of the most rugged in the world, characterised by huge variations in altitude. Within the 150 miles between the southern and northern borders, Bhutan's elevation rises from 150 to more than 7,500 metres. This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan's outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems.
The tiger, One-horned rhino, golden langur, clouded leopard, hispid hare and the sloth bear live in the lush tropical lowland and hardwood forests in the south. In the temperate zone, grey langur, tiger, common leopard, goral and serow are found in mixed conifer, broadleaf and pine forests. Fruit bearing trees and bamboo provide habitat for the Himalayan black bear, red panda, squirrel, sambar, wild pig and barking deer. The alpine habitats of the great Himalayan range in the north are home to the snow leopard, blue sheep, marmot, Tibetan wolf, antelope and Himalayan musk deer.
Flora and birds abound with more than 770 species of bird and 5,400 species of plants known to occur throughout the kingdom.
Conservation Significance.
The Eastern Himalayas have been identified as a global biodiversity hotspot and counted among the 234 globally outstanding ecoregions of the world in a comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity undertaken by WWF between 1995-97.
Bhutan is seen as a model for proactive conservation initiatives. The Kingdom has received international acclaim for its commitment to the maintenance of its biodiversity. This is reflected in the decision to maintain at least sixty percent of the land area under forest cover, to designate more than a quarter of its territory as national parks, reserves and other protected areas, and most recently to identify a further nine percent of land area as biodiversity corridors linking the protected areas.
Environmental conservation has been placed at the core of the nation's development strategy, the middle path. It is not treated as a sector but rather as a set of concerns that must be mainstreamed in Bhutan's overall approach to development planning and to be buttressed by the force of law.
Conservation Issues.
Although Bhutan's natural heritage is still largely intact, the Government has rightly recognised that it cannot be taken for grant and that conservation of the natural environment must be considered one of the challenges that will need to be addressed in the years ahead.
Pressures on the natural environment are already evident and will be fuelled by a complex array of forces. They include population pressures, agricultural modernisation, poaching, large-scale hydro-power development, mineral extraction, industrialisation, urbanisation, sewage and waste disposal, tourism, competition for available land road construction and the provision of other physical infrastructure associated with social and economic development.
Policy implementation needs to be continually improved. Sustainable rural livelihoods that do not rely solely upon natural resource use need to be developed and supported, and there needs to be far wider understanding of the environmental threats that come hand in hand with development, to ensure the future of Bhutan's rich and diverse environment.

Mikhail Levashev

Mikhail D. Levashev (spelt "Levashef" in the United States) (c. 1738–1774-76) was a Russian explorer and Lieutenant of the Imperial Russian Navy. After Vitus Bering's 1741 tragic venture he was, together with Peter Kuzmich Krenitzin, among the first to conduct an expedition to Alaska and the Aleutians. 
Levashev was sent by Russian Empress Catherine II, as main assistant of expedition leader Krenitzin, to explore the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean and particularly the area around the Bering strait on four ships. Levashev was the commander of ship "St. Paul", while Krenitzin was in command of the "St. Catherine". Krenitzin and Levashev surveyed the eastern part of the Aleutian island chain. In 1768-69 Levashef wintered in a natural harbor in Unalaska. The following year, after resuming their explorations, both ships wintered in Kamchatka.
Certain geographic features of the Alaskan coast, like Avatanak and Akutan Island were named by Krenitzin and Levashev in the maps that were subsequently published.
On July 4, 1770, when Krenitzin drowned, Levashef assumed command of the Russian expedition fleet and returned to St. Petersburg, where he arrived on October 22, 1771.
Port Levashef, the harbor in Unalaska where Levashev had wintered his first year in the Northern Pacific was named in honor of this early Russian explorer by Lieutenant Gavril Sarychev.

Miners' institute

Miners' institutes, sometimes known as "Workingmen's institute", "Mine Workers' institute", or "Miners' Welfare Hall" are large institutional buildings that were typically built during the height of the industrial period as a meeting and educational venue. More commonly found in Britain, miners' institutes were owned by miner groups who gave a proportion of their wage into a communal fund to pay for the construction and running of the building. The institutes would normally contain a library, reading room and meeting room.
Miners' institutes of South Wales.
During the late 19th century, with the population growth seen in former rural communities, many industrialised areas saw workers contributing to funds to build institutes. This was typified in the southern coalfield of Wales, which by 1910 saw institutes built in most towns and villages. The institutes were of socialist and altruistic nature and would include small libraries and reading rooms, whose books would lean towards history and politics, in an attempt to allow the working class man to better himself. Aneurin Bevan attributed his intellectual training to the Tredegar miners' library. 
While the library and reading room took care of the intellectual needs of the population the larger institutes often catered for the social side by providing a billiards hall, a refreshment room, and a large hall which could be used for meetings or entertainment. The 'Stute, as it was popularly known, soon became the heart of the community.
The institutes were normally run by committee chosen by the workers, and a nominal fee was required from members to pay for the running costs, though some philanthropic coalowners would financially support the local institute. Following the Royal Commission for Coal in 1919, a Miners' Welfare Fund was established to provide amenities for the miners, such as communal baths, scholarships and welfare halls. This in turn led to the construction of welfare halls in the areas which to this date had no miners' institutes. 
By the eve of the Second World War there were more than a hundred miners' institutes, those of note include 'Y Stiwt' in Rhosllannerchrugog, the Oakdale Miners' Institute, the Parc and Dare in the Rhondda and the Abercynon Miners' Institute. Most of the institutes survived into the 1970s but with the decline of coal many of the buildings were left to ruin. Slowly returning prosperity to former mining communities has witnessed a revival of some of the institutes, such as those at Blackwood, Llanhilleth and Newbridge, which have rebranded themselves as entertainment or arts centres.
The South Wales Miners' Library in Swansea keeps many of the collections from the institutes intact, and the Oakdale Institute has been reconstructed at St Fagans National History Museum.

Orthonama obstipata

__NOTOC__
The Gem (Orthonama obstipata) is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is a common species of Continental Europe and adjacent lands, though in the northeast, its range does not significantly extend beyond the Baltic region and it is absent from northern Russia. This well-flying species is somewhat prone to vagrancy and able to cross considerable distances of open sea; it can thus be regularly found on the British Isles (though mainly in the south) and even on Iceland.
Under its junior synonyms "Nycterosea brunneipennis" and "Geometra fluviata", the Willow Beauty is the type species of genera "Nycterosea" and "Percnoptilota", respectively. The latter is treated as junior synonym of the former, but "Nycterosea", though usually included in "Orthonama" these days, may warrant recognition as an independent genus after all.
Description and ecology.
The adult's wingspan is 18–21 mm; in their core range (e.g. Belgium and the Netherlands) they can be seen between April and November, but in outlying regions they may only be regularly encountered in late summer and early autumn, when vagrant individuals abound. This species is strongly sexually dimorphic: males are light brown with a wavy pattern of whitish lines and a broad darker band running across the wings, forming concentric semicircles when the moth is at rest. There is a small whitish-rimmed black spot within the darker band between the center and the leading edge of each forewing. The females are slightly larger and much darker, almost uniformly blackish-brown with an indistinct lighter pattern and a forewing spot like the males have.
The caterpillar larvae feed on a wide range of low-growing core eudicots, but prefer asterids. Host plants recorded from the Central European part of its range include:
Euasterids I
Euasterids II
Eurosids II
Basal core eudicots
Synonyms.
The widespread, strongly sexually dimorphic and somewhat phenotypically variable Willow Beauty has been described anews times and again by various authors, even as late as the early 20th century. But all these supposeddly distinct taxa are nowadays considered to refer to a single species. Junior synonyms of the Willow Beauty include:

Wildlife of Pakistan

Wildlife of Pakistan: flora and fauna and their natural habitats. Wildlife can also be termed as a series of non-domesticated plant and animal life. 
Habitats of flora and fauna.
Northern highlands and plains.
The northern highlands include lower elevation areas of Potohar and Azad Kashmir regions and higher elevation areas embracing the foothills of Himalayan, Karakorum and Hindukush mountain ranges. These areas provide an excellent habitat for wildlife in the form of alpine grazing lands, sub-alpine scrub and temperate forests. The areas are difficult for human beings to access, hence, most wildlife is present in reasonable numbers though some are endangered for other reasons. The northern highlands of Pakistan are covered with conifer and scrub forests, which have been reduced to scanty growth in most places. the biome is defined as northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows.
Some of the wildlife species found on northern mountainous areas and Pothohar Plateau include the non-threatened mammal species of bharal, Eurasian lynx, Himalayan goral, Indian leopard, Marco Polo sheep, marmot (in Deosai National Park) and yellow-throated marten and birds species of chukar partridge, Eurasian eagle-owl, Himalayan monal and Himalayan snowcock and amphibian species of Himalayan toad and Muree Hills frog. The threatened ones include Asiatic black bear, Himalayan brown bear, Indian wolf, Kashmir gray langur, Kashmir red deer, markhor, Rhesus macaque, Siberian ibex, smooth-coated otter, Snow Leopard and white-bellied musk deer, bird species of cheer pheasant, peregrine falcon, western tragopan. and reptile species of mugger crocodile.
Indus plains and deserts of Sindh.
River Indus and its numerous eastern tributaries of Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, Jhelum, Beas are spread across most of Punjab. The plain of river Indus continues towards and occupy most of western Sindh. The plains have many fluvial landforms (including bars, flood plains, levees, meanders and ox-bows) that support various natural biomes including tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forestry as well as tropical and xeric shrublands (deserts of Thal in Punjab and of Cholistan, Nara and Tharparkar in Sindh). The banks and stream beds of the river system also support riparian woodlands that exhibit the tree species of kikar, mulberry and sheesham. The reed beds and tamarisk bushes along the rivers are also present. Such geographical landforms accompanied by an excellent system of monsoon climate provides an excellent ground for diversity of flora and fauna species. However, the plains are equally appealing to humans for agricultural goals and development of civilization. Vast Indus flood plains have been cleared of natural vegetation to grow crops. This has caused only a few species to become endangered.
Some of the non-threatened mammal species includes the nilgai, red fox and wild boar, bird species of Alexandrine parakeet, barn owl, black kite, myna, hoopoe, Indian peafowl, red-vented bulbul, rock pigeon, shelduck and shikra, reptile species of Indian cobra, Indian star tortoise, Sindh krait and yellow monitor and amphibian species of Indus Valley bullfrog and Indus Valley toad. Some of the threatened mammal species include the axis deer, blackbuck, hog deer, Indian rhinoceros, Punjab urial and Sindh ibex, bird species of white-backed vulture and reptile species of black pond turtle and gharial. Grey partridge is one of the few birds that can be found in the Cholistan desert. The Tharparkar desert supports a fair population of the chinkara. The Asiatic wild ass migrates from the Indian part of the Great Rann of Kutch to the part in Pakistan in search of food. Wild boar numbers have increased because of the immunity they enjoy in a Muslim society that forbids its consumption by humans.
Western highlands, plains and deserts.
Western region of Pakistan, most of which is enveloped in Balochistan province, has a complex geography. In mountainous highlands, habitat varries from conifer forests of deodar in Waziristan and juniper in Ziarat. Numerous mountain ranges surround the huge lowland plains of Balochistan Plateau, through which a rather intricate meshwork of seasonal rivers and salt pans is spread. Deserts are also present, showing xeric shrubland vegetation in the region. Date palms and ephedra are common flora varieties in the desert.
Some of the mammal species include the caracal, Balochistan dormouse, Blanford's fox, dromedary camel, goitered gazelle, Indian crested porcupine, Long-eared hedgehog, markhor, ratel and striped hyena, bird species of bearded vulture, Houbara bustard and merlin, reptile species of leopard gecko and saw-scaled viper and amphibian species of Balochistan toad.
Wetlands, coastal regions and marine life.
There are a number of protected wetlands (under Ramsar Convention) in Pakistan. These include Tanda dam and Thanedar Wala in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Chashma barrage, Taunsa barrage and Uchhali complex in Punjab, Haleji lake, Hub dam and Kinjhar lake in Sindh, Miani Hor in Balochistan. The wetlands are an habitat for migratory birds such as dalmatian pelicans and demoiselle crane as well as predatory species of osprey, common kingfisher, fishing cat and leopard cat near the coast line. Chashma and Taunsa Barrage Dolphin Sanctuary protects the threatened species of Indus River dolphins which tend to live in freshwater.
The coastline of Pakistan is 1,050 km long and consists of a variety of habitat types, supporting a wide range of animals, of which over 1000 are fish species in the reefs of its continental shelf. The east half of the coast of Pakistan is located in the south of Sindh province which features Indus River Delta and coast of Great Rann of Kutch. The largest saltwater wetland in Pakistan is the Indus River Delta. Unlike many other river deltas, it consists of clay soil and is very swampy. West coast of Great Rann of Kutch, east to the Indus River Delta and below Tharparkar desert, is one of the few places where greater flamingos come to breed. It is also a habitat for endangered species of lesser florican. Unlike Indus River Delta, this part of the coast is not as swampy and exhibits shrubland vegetation of rather dry thorny shrubs as well as marsh grasses of Apluda and Cenchrus. 
The vegetation of Indus River Delta is mainly represented by various mangrove species and bamboo species. The Indus River Delta-Arabian Sea mangroves is a focused ecoregion of WWF. Nearly 95% of the mangroves located in the Indus River Delta are of the species Avicennia marina. Very small patches of Ceriops roxburghiana and Aegicerias corniculata are found. These provide nesting grounds for common snakehead, giant snakehead, Indus baril and many species of catfish like rita. The hilsa swims up from the Arabian Sea to spawn in freshwater. Species that are important to people as food, such as the golden mahseer and large freshwater shrimp ("Macrobrachium" species), are part of the abundant aquatic life.
The west half of the Pakistan coast is in the south of Balochistan province. It is also called the Makran coast and exhibits protected sites such as Astola Island and Hingol National Park. The three major mangrove plantations of Balochistan coast are Miani Hor, Kalmat Khor and Gwatar Bay. Miani Hor is a swampy lagoon on the coast in the Lasbela district where the climate is very arid. The sources of fresh water for Miani Hor are the seasonal river of Porali. The nearest river to the other lagoon, Kalmat Khor, is the Basol River. Gawatar, the third site, is an open bay with a mouth almost as wide as its length. Its freshwater source is the Dasht River, the largest seasonal river of Baluchistan. All three bays support mainly A. marina species of mangrove. Pakistan also plans to rehabilitate mangrove-degraded areas at Sonmiani and Jiwani in Balochistan.
Along the shores of Astola and Ormara beaches of Balochistan and Hawk'e Bay and Sandspit beaches of Sindh are nesting sites for five endangered species of sea turtles: Green Sea, Loggerhead, Hawksbill, Olive Ridley and Leatherback. Sea snakes such as yellow-bellied sea snake are also found in the pelagic zone of the sea. The wetlands of Pakistan are also a home to the endangered species of gharial and mugger crocodile who prefer freshwater habitat.

Brick Lane (film)

Brick Lane is a 2007 British drama film directed by Sarah Gavron and adapted from the novel of the same name by the British writer Monica Ali, published in 2003. The screenplay was written by Laura Jones and Abi Morgan. 
The Indian actress Tannishtha Chatterjee played the lead role of Nazneen. The film had its first public screening at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States.
Plot.
The film tells the story of Nazneen, who grew up in rural Bangladesh, in the district of Mymensingh. At 17 she has an arranged marriage to Chanu Ahmed, who is twice her age. They soon move to Brick Lane in London, the center of the British Bangladeshi community. She leaves behind her sister and her family home. 
Married to a man she does not love, Nazneen lives vicariously through the letters she receives from her sister about her carefree life. The film picks up the story after Nazneen and her husband have lived in a small flat for 16 years and been raising 2 daughters. 
Nazneen becomes filled with desire for a young, good-looking clothing worker who visits her flat, and they have an affair. The movie takes place following the 9/11 attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda, and reflects a period of heightened racial tensions in Britain as well. The Bangladeshi Muslim community was becoming increasingly religious, as reflected in the character of Karim.
Casting and production.
Tannishtha Chatterjee was the first actress who auditioned for the role of Nazneen. Two months after her initial audition, after Gavron had seen several hundred women, Gavron hired her. Both Christopher Simpson, who played Karim, and Chatterjee studied the Bangladeshi culture in Brick Lane by following around locals. Satish Kaushik was cast after Gavron saw a picture of him on the Internet. Since "Brick Lane" was his first English-language film, he took lessons from a diction coach to improve his accent. 
Many residents of Brick Lane were hired as extras to appear on the film, and some members of crew were hired from the local area. The film's winter scenes were shot in the middle of a heat wave in Summer 2006, which required the production team to use artificial snow. Portions of the film were shot in West Bengal.
Ruby Films was the production company. Sarah Gavron intended to film some scenes in Brick Lanes. Because of opposition from some of the local community, police advised her to change locations after demonstrations were threatened.
The novel and film provoked criticism by some in the Bangladeshi community in London, who thought that Chanu and the Bangladeshis from Sylheti generally, were portrayed in a negative way. Some traders organized against having the film company doing any production in the neighborhood; on 31 July 2006, about 120 British Bangladeshis held a protest in Brick Lane. Others wrote letters to the editor in "The Guardian" and spoke in support of the film production, including the British chapter of PEN and the writer Salman Rushdie.
Reception.
Roger Ebert praised the film's characters for their "depth and reality." Several critics, including Robert Koehler of "Variety," compared it unfavourably with the novel. The film was also praised in France. "Brick Lane" was well received by most critics, earning a 63% favourable rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a rating of 61/100 on Metacritic. 
As a result of the earlier controversy and a threatened protest, a planned screening for Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall was cancelled.
Awards.
Sarah Gavron was nominated for a BAFTA award. Both Tannishtha Chatterjee and Sarah Gavron were nominated for BIFA awards, for the best actress and best director in 2007, respectively. The film won a Silver Hitchcock and best screenplay at the Dinard Festival of British Cinema.
DVD release.
The film was released in the UK on 16 November 2007, and in the US by Sony Picture Classics in limited release on 20 June 2008. The DVD Region 2 release occurred on 10 March 2008 and the Region 1 DVD of the film was released on 13 January 2009.

The Median Wall was a wall built to the north of the ancient city of Babylon at a point where the distance between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates decreases considerably. It was believed to have been constructed during the latter part of the reign of Nebuchadrezzar II and to have consisted of baked brick and bitumen. The centre of the wall was packed with earth. The wall was built to prevent any potential invasion by the Medes from the north — hence the name 'Median' Wall.
The ancient Greek writer Xenophon states that the wall was in existence in 401 BC in his book the Anabasis (or 'The Persian Expedition').

Nuri

Nuri is a place in modern Sudan on the south (east) side of the Nile. Close to it, there are pyramids belonging to Nubian kings. Nuri is situated about 15 km north of Sanam, and 10 km from Jebel Barkal. All these remains belonged to the ancient city Napata, the first capital of the Nubian kingdom of Kush. 
The earliest pyramid (Nu. 1) at Nuri belongs to king Taharqa which measures 51.75 metres square by 40 or by 50 metres high. His successor Tantamani was buried somewhere else, but all following Nubian kings and many of their wives till Nastasen (Nu. 15) (about 330 BC) were buried here. The pyramids at Nuri are in general smaller than the Egyptian ones and are today often heavily destroyed, but they often still contained substantial parts of the funerary equipment of the Kushite rulers who were buried here. During the Christian era, a church was erected here. The church was built of many old stones, including several stelae originally coming from the pyramids.
The pyramids were systematically excavated by George Reisner.
The pyramids of Nuri together with other buildings in the region around Gebel Barkal have been placed on the UNESCO list of world cultural heritage sites since 2003. 
Tombs at Nuri.
The royal family of Kush was buried in the cemeteries of Nuri and el-Kurru.
The pyramids of Nuri are built on two separate plateaus. The highest point in the cemetery is taken up by Taharqa's pyramid on the western plateau. The pyramids of the other kings are located on the eastern plateau. The pyramids of the royal women are placed closer to Taharqa's pyramid on the western plateau. These pyramids fall into three groups: (1) A group of pyramids is located to the south and west of Taharqa's pyramid; (2) Two parallel rows are located to the north of Taharqa's pyramid; (3) A group of very small tombs is located to the far north.<br>
The King's Mothers were buried in the southern group, but this is not an area exclusively used for the burial of King's Mothers. Most of the King's Wives were buried in the parallel rows just north of Taharqa's tomb. The tombs to the far north were much smaller and may have been built for wives of lesser rank.

Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon 10 kilometre

The men's marathon 10 kilometre event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 21 August at the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park in Beijing, China. 
Dutch swimmer and cancer survivor Maarten van der Weijden enjoyed the race of his life as he sprinted in a three-way battle against Great Britain's David Davies and Germany's Thomas Lurz to a spectacular finish under a scorching rain, and most importantly, to claim the Olympic title in the inaugural men's open water marathon. With only a few hundred metres left, he pulled ahead from the rest of the field before slapping the yellow pads first in 1:51:51.6. Van der Weijden was diagnosed with leukemia in 2001; however, with the aid of a stem cell treatment, he came back stronger from a two-year ordeal to resume his swimming career.
Leading almost the entire race by over six body lengths, Davies drifted offline at the final stages, and eventually missed out the title by 1.5 seconds with the silver-medal time in 1:51:53.1. Meanwhile, Lurz held off the final pack to claim the bronze in 1:51:53.9, finishing exactly two seconds behind Van der Weijden.
Farther from the trio, Italy's Valerio Cleri finished off the podium with a fourth-place time in 1:52:07.5, and was followed in fifth by Russia's Evgeny Drattsev at 1:52:08.9. Bulgaria's Petar Stoychev, the English Channel record holder, trailed behind his Russian rival in a sprint challenge by two-tenths of a second (0.20), earning a sixth spot in 1:52:09.1. Belgium's Brian Ryckeman (1:52:10.7) and U.S. swimmer Mark Warkentin (1:52:13.0) managed to pull off from the rest of the field with a top-eight finish.
Russia's pre-Olympic favorite and world champion Vladimir Dyatchin was disqualified from the race after he received a pair of yellow cards for obstructing his fellow swimmers and a red card for misconduct.
Qualification.
The men's 10 km races at the 2008 Olympics featured a field of twenty-five swimmers:
Competition format.
Unlike all of the other swimming events in the pool, the men's and women's marathon 10 kilometre races were held in open water. No preliminary heats were held, with only the single mass-start race being contested. This race is held using freestyle swimming, with a lack of stroke regulations. For most of the event swimmers use the front crawl, but modifications are used situationally, especially when swimmers reach feeding stations.
Open water swimming events require different tactics and showcase several different racing strategies that are more common to competitive cycling, marathon running and water polo than traditional pool swimming. It is one of the few Olympic sports where the athlete's coaches play a critical role during the actual event. The coaches have four opportunities to provide drinks to their athletes as the athletes swim by floating pontoons in the course. If the coach falls in the water, his or her athlete is immediately disqualified.

Why We Can't Wait

"Why We Can't Wait" is a book by Martin Luther King, Jr. about the struggle against racial segregation in the United States, and specifically the 1963 Birmingham campaign. The book describes 1963 as a landmark year in the civil rights movement, and as the beginning of America's "Negro Revolution".
Writing.
The seed of the book is King's Letter from Birmingham Jail. The letter became nationally known and received interest from the New York publishing world, which Stanley Levison relayed to King in May 1963. Soon after, Levison made a deal with New American Library publisher Victor Weybright, who suggested that the theme of not waiting be used for the title. Weybright also gave permission for Letter from Birmingham Jail to be republished in national newspapers and magazines; it appeared in July 1963 as "Why the Negro Won't Wait".
King began working on the book later in 1963, with assistance from Levison and Clarence Jones. Some early work on the text was done by Al Duckett (also a participant in the movement). King and Levison eventually dismissed Duckett and then Nat Lamar, and Levison did some work on the text himself. Bayard Rustin also contributed, as did editor Hermine I. Popper.
Rustin said: "I don't want to write something for somebody where I know he is acting like a puppet. I want to be a real ghost and write what the person wants to say. And that is what I always knew was true in the case of Martin. I would never write anything that wasn't what he wanted to say. I understood him well enough."
The book largely reproduces the text of Letter from Birmingham Jail, with some editorial changes. King writes in a footnote: "Although the text remains in substance unaltered, I have indulged in the author's prerogative in polishing it for publication."
"Why We Can't Wait" was published by Harper & Row in July 1964. The paperback edition cost 60¢.
Outline.
The book describes 1963 as the beginning of "the Negro revolution". It seeks to describe the historical events that led up to this revolution, and to explain why this revolution was non-violent. King seeks to describe this history because of how quickly it has become visible to America at large, and because of its importance in events to come. He writes:
Just as lightning makes no sound until it strikes, the Negro Revolution generated quietly. But when it struck, the revealing flash of its power and the impact of its sincerity and fervor displayed a force of a frightening intensity. Three hundred years of humiliation, abuse, and deprivation cannot be expected to find voice in a whisper. [...]<br>
Because there is more to come; because American society is bewildered by the spectacle of the Negro in revolt; because the dimensions are vast and the implications deep in a nation with twenty million Negroes, it is important to understand the history that is being made today.
Why 1963?
King gives several reasons why the Negro Revolution erupted in 1963:
Nonviolent resistance.
King goes on to describe why nonviolent resistance was so powerful. One of its major strengths involved changing the function of jails in society. Previously, jail was used as an element of intimidation: authorities used the threat of pain and isolation in jail to control many separate individuals. Large groups of demonstrators, however, had the power to fill up jails—and to "politicize" the act of being jailed, thereby making jail less of a punishment. He condemns tokenism as an act of deception that offers false pride without real power: "The Negro wanted to feel pride in his race? With tokenism, the solution was simple. If all twenty million Negroes would keep looking at Ralph Bunche, the one man in so exalted a post would generate such a volume of pride that it could be cut into portions and served to everyone." King distinguishes between tokenism and a "modest start" to equality, writing that tokenism serves to stifle dissent and protest, not to start a process.
He criticizes other approaches to social change for Blacks, including the quietism of Booker T. Washington, the elitism of W. E. B. Du Bois's appeal to The Talented Tenth, the Pan-Africanism of Marcus Garvey, and the litigation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). King argues that none of these leaders and philosophies held the promise of real mass change for all African Americans.
Birmingham.
King describes "Bull Connor's Birmingham" as an anachronistic city whose social order resembled colonial-era slavery. He writes that Blacks lack basic human rights, and are ruled by violence and terror.
He chronicles preliminary demonstrations held by the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACHR) and then describes Bull Connor's attempts to intimidate the SCLC. He tells about how the SCLC nevertheless planned the Birmingham campaign, believing that if segregation could be overcome in Birmingham it could have effects across the entire United States.
King describes the alliance between the SCLC and the ACHR, and reproduces the text of a "Commitment Card" used for recruiting. (Volunteers who signed the card pledged to meditate on the life of Jesus, pray daily, observe the interests of the community, and to seek "justice and reconciliation—not victory".) He tells the story of how he was imprisoned in the course of demonstrations and then reproduces his (already and thereafter) famous "Letter from Birmingham Jail".
The city government became increasingly willing to negotiate as demonstrations continued. King describes mass participation by young people, full jails, and international media attention fueled by powerful photographs. Negotiators reached an agreement on Friday, May 10, 1963: the city promised desegregation within 90 days, jobs for Blacks in local industry, release of those jailed during the campaign, and ongoing formal diplomacy between Black and White leaders.
The agreement triggered an assassination attempt on King, orchestrated by the local Ku Klux Klan. The bombing at King's hotel room triggered a civil disturbance in Birmingham which brought in the police forces and then the National Guard.
Thousands of student demonstrators were expelled from school by the Birmingham Board of Education. The decision was challenged by the NAACP and overruled by Judge Elbert P. Tuttle in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Ongoing revolution.
King advocates continued action in Birmingham, comparing the campaign to the Battle of Bunker Hill—the beginning of organization in a revolutionary army. He warns against complacency in the wake of the Birmingham demonstrations, suggesting that revolt is only the beginning of revolution.
He calls for multi-racial unity, suggesting that Africans were not the only group oppressed in America: "Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society." He argues that the summer of 1963 has made most Whites in America more receptive to the idea of legal equality for Blacks.
He describes the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, praising the participation of White churches but frustrated by the neutrality of the AFL–CIO. He notes that millions of Americans watched scenes from the March on television and expresses hope for the future of this medium.
The conclusion provides an explanation of "why we can't wait": that Blacks must no longer move towards freedom, but assert their freedom. King writes: "It is because the Negro knows that no person—as well as no nation—can truly exist half slave and half free that he has embroiders upon his banners the significant word ." He calls for a Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged, including reparations for unpaid wages. He holds out hope for a coalition with poor Whites and organized labor. He suggests that the civil rights movement may be able to work with President Lyndon Johnson, cautioning that political work is dangerous but necessary. He ends by saying that if the civil rights revolution succeeds it may spread nonviolence worldwide, ending the nuclear arms race and bringing world peace.
Reception and effect.
The book was generally well received by the mainstream press. It also afforded the Letter from Birmingham Jail its widest circulation yet.
King traveled to promote the book, while also still involved in the St. Augustine Movement.
"We We Can't Wait" was an important part of the effort to make the civil rights struggle known to national and international audiences. Describing Birmingham as "the most segregated city in America" transformed it into a symbol for segregation and inequality at large.
Legacy.
"Adbusters" cited "Why We Can't Wait" (and the Poor People's Campaign) in September 2011 as an inspiration for Occupy Wall Street.
In October 2011, the Obama administration started using the slogan "We Can't Wait", based on the plan to enact policies despite a resistant Congress.
The novel has received much contemporary critical acclaim, and was ranked #78 on Modern Library's list of the 100 best non-fiction novels written in English.

Drian Francisco

Drian Francisco (born November 10, 1982 in Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro, Philippines), more commonly known as Drian 'Gintong Kamao' Francisco, is a Filipino professional boxer. Born in the province of Mindoro, Francisco currently resides in Agoncillo, Batangas. His younger brother Lloyd Francisco, like him, is also a professional boxer.
Fighting style.
Francisco is known for his powerful punches and aggressive style. His style was formerly compared to that of Luisito Espinosa.
Professional career.
Francisco's father, Joe, was a former pro who is now a fireman. Early in his professional career, he was trained by former world flyweight titlist Erbito Salavarria.
He won the WBO Asia Pacific flyweight title by a 7th round TKO win over Pichitchok Singmanassak on December 30, 2006. On August 4, 2007, he defended it by stopping Wanmeechok Singwancha in one round.
After a year of inactivity, he was back in the ring on April 19, 2009 where he scored a TKO win over Sharil Fabanyo. This was held at the Araneta Coliseum and was undercard of the Nonito Donaire - Raul Martinez match.
Francisco won the WBA International super flyweight title on October 3, 2009 by stopping former WBA flyweight champion Roberto Vasquez in 10 rounds.
He fought Ricardo Nunez in a WBA super flyweight eliminator on April 17, 2010, at the Yñares Sports Arena in Pasig City, Metro Manila, Philippines. A few days before the bout, Francisco said that a win against Nunez was the key for a title shot. The Filipino boxer won the bout with an impressive knockout win at the 5th round. Francisco dominated the bout from the very start and was able to knock down Nunez twice in the opening round. Nunez survived the count and tried to defend himself and box his foe in the second and third round, connecting with some solid shot to stem Francisco's aggressive style. The boxer from Panama continued on this way in the next round but was once again put in trouble and eventually knocked down twice in the 5th, after being hammered with solid combinations. Referee Bruce McTavish stopped the bout after the second knockdown.
He fought Duangpetch Kokietgym on November 30, 2010 in Nong Khai, Thailand for the WBA interim superflyweight title. He won the bout with an impressive 10th round knockout.
It was a tough fight for Drian as Kokietgym repeatedly landed low blows. But in the end, Drian Francisco was able to overcome and knockout Kokietgym for the victory and WBA Interim Superflyweight Championship crown. The Thai fighter was down and out for only the second time in 54 fights.
Drian Francisco will most likely fight the winner of the Dec. 23 fight between WBA superflyweight champion Hugo Cazares and Japanese challenger Hiroyuki Hisataka. The winner of that fight will be mandated to stake the crown against Francisco on March 9. Cazares, 32, is traveling to Osaka to face Hisataka in his third title defense.
On 1 May 2011 Drian Francisco defensed his WBA interim World Super Flyweight title to Thai boxer Tepparith Singwancha at Thailand. Francisco was knocked down in the third round. At the end Francisco lost WBA interim World Super Flyweight title for 
Thai boxer in Unanimous decision 113-114,113-114,111-117 
Drian admitted he was overconfident, he vowed to bounce back from the shock loss on points to Terrapith Singwancha and said he won’t make the same mistake again. Drian fought against Michael Domingo which he won in a unanimous decision in Makati Coliseum on September 23, 2011. All three judges saw the fight in favor of the Sablayan, Mindoro Occidental native Francisco (21-1-1, 16 knockouts)—96-93, 95-94 and 96-93.

Triangle Group (also known as Triangle Tyre) is a Chinese tire company that manufactures a range of tires for vehicles from passenger cars to construction equipment and tires fit for special purposes. Based on 2012 sales revenue, it is the 14th largest tire maker in the world, according to a ranking produced by China Research and Intelligence in 2013.
Triangle Group was founded by the Weihai government in 1976. Lacking a car industry in China, the company supplied tiny tyres to Indonesian street-sweepers rubbish carts in the following years. The company grew in size but did not make money until in 1993 with the installment of new management, Triangle reworked itself into a competitive enterprise. In making dramatic reforms, the company invested in new, more modern production and implemented strict workforce discipline. The restructuring would continue into the 2000s, when the company considered a public offering and so brought its accounting to developed world standards and continuously invested in more sophisticated manufacturing lines. These efforts to make itself a top league tire maker would be the subject of a profile article in "The Economist" during June 2008. In recent years, the company has focused more on research and development, announcing a desire to become a technology leader, through research partnerships with universities. In 2011, it signed an agreement with the University of Akron to work together on polymer research and also opened an office in the same town of Akron, Ohio with plans for 30 employees. It partnered up in 2012 with the Harbin Institute of Technology to carry out research on designing and manufacturing tires for large bodied aircraft, enabling Triangle to compete with two other companies in China that already produce such tires.
The company works as a strategic partner and supplier to many overseas companies. It has struck partnerships with Caterpillar, Volvo, and Goodyear. In terms of market share success, the company's most dominant placement is in the off the road (OTR) category, which includes tires for mining, construction, and other industrial uses. It is the 4th largest manufacturer of OTR tires with the company shipping 90% of its OTR stock to export markets.

A "Wine Spectator" report by Laube that Chateau Montelena wine was tainted by TCA, was followed by a great deal of controversy, and the contention that Laube is able to detect TCA at much lower levels than most people. In a letter to the "San Francisco Chronicle", Steve Heimoff, an editor of a competing wine magazine "Wine Enthusiast", wrote that Laube's position as a critic in a prominent magazine should be more cautious about branding wines as being tainted when most wine drinkers do not have the same level of sensitivity to detect anything wrong with those wines.
Influence on California wine.
As the lead reviewer of wines from California for "Wine Spectator", Laube's influence over the California wine industry has been compared to that of the "Wine Advocate's" Robert M. Parker, Jr.. Laube's preference for high alcohol, full bodied wines that have been aged in oak has been charged by some critics as a possible reason for the high numbers of that style of wine being produced in California.

Lapland Air Command

The Lapland Air Command (, abbr. "LapLsto"; ) is the peace-time Finnish Air Force unit, responsible for the protection of the airspace of northern Finland. The headquarters of the air command is located in the present-day province of Lapland, at the airport of Rovaniemi.
The Lapland Air Command was founded in 1973, when the Tavastia Air Command was moved to Rovaniemi. The unit was officially renamed into the Lapland Air Commandon in 1974. It was equipped with Saab Draken fighters. The wing was founded due to the increased importance of the airspace in Cold War Europe. The Soviet Navy had large installations on the Kola peninsula, while NATO had a large number of aircraft in northern Norway. Both sides often held large wargames nearby.
In the early 2000s, the wing was equipped with F-18 Hornet fighters, the first were received in January 1999, and operative readiness was obtained in 2000. At the same time, all Drakens were retired.
The Wing's main duty is to guard and defend the air space, as well as to support the land forces. The wing trains conscripts for aerial surveillance, and for general service and support for the fighter flights. The Lapland Air Defence Regiment is also located at the base.
The 11th Fighter Squadron is the operational unit of the Lapland Air Command.

Dyno-Rod

Dyno is an emergency drainage, security and plumbing company operating in the United Kingdom. Formed in 1963, Dyno initially specialised in the use of electromechanical machines for drain clearance. Since then, the company has grown considerably, consolidating its drainage business and diversifying into areas including security and comprehensive plumbing services for both domestic and industrial sites. 
Dyno describes itself as ‘the market leader’, and as ‘the only drain cleaning service with full national coverage.’ It specialises in ‘clearing blockages, CCTV drain inspection surveys, drain repairs and pipework installations’, along with plumbing and security services. The company offers a 24-hour emergency response service, and maintains engineers across the UK and Eire.
Dyno Services is a franchise-granting limited company. It was acquired by British Gas in 2004.
History.
The Dyno-Rod service was launched in 1963 by Jim Zockoll, in South London and then the business was based in Surbiton for many years. 
Jim Zockoll was an American Pan-AM pilot who spotted an opportunity whilst on a stop over in London. The hotel where Jim Zockoll was staying at was suffering drainage problems and the time to fix this and the equipment used were outdated. Jim Zockoll knew of other methods and equipment currently in use in the USA and so arranged with colleagues to get this equipment flown over and Jim fixed the problem and Dyno-Rod was effectively born! 
Dyno-Rod focused itself as a specialised drain cleaning service using pioneering electromechanical techniques. This service remains a core element of Dyno’s business. After initial success, Dyno began granting franchise licences, with the first franchisee established in 1965. There are currently 75 Dyno franchisees in the United Kingdom.
As the first non-fast food and the 2nd franchised business in the UK, Dyno-Rod played a prominent role in the formation of the British Franchise Association (the franchise industry’s self-regulating body). 
Over time the Dyno brand developed other associated businesses with Dyno-Secure launching in 1987 to offer a range of locks and security services and Dyno-Plumbing following in 2001 to offer a comprehensive plumbing service.
Dyno Group was acquired by British Gas – itself a subsidiary of Centrica – in October 2004. A period of development followed this acquisition. Since 2004, a number of Dyno franchisees have developed larger territories and now operate multiple brands within the Dyno group of businesses.
Operating Information.
Dyno Services grants franchise licenses across three limited companies. There are currently 75 franchisees operating Dyno services under the Dyno-Rod, Dyno-Plumbing and Dyno Locks & Alarms brands. 
Along with as the 75 franchise offices, Dyno is headquartered at the British Gas Orbis Office complex in Staines, while the businesses customer operations HQ is at the British Gas offices in Edinburgh, supported by Oldbury.

Mahinerangi Wind Farm

The Mahinerangi Wind Farm is a wind farm on the north side of Lake Mahinerangi, around 50 km west of Dunedin, in Otago, New Zealand. Stage one of the wind farm, generating 36 MW, was commissioned in March 2011, and an additional 164 MW is consented to be commissioned in further stages.
The wind farm is owned and operated by generator-retailer TrustPower. It is the company's third wind farm, and the second major wind farm to be built in the South Island.
History.
Resource consent was granted in 2007 and later confirmed after an appeal to the Environment Court.
Construction of stage 1 of the wind farm, consisting of twelve turbines, began in September 2010. Vestas V90-3MW turbines were chosen for the wind farm, having previously used by TrustPower for stage 3 of its Tararua Wind Farm in 2007. Turbines were shipped to Port Chalmers, and trucked through Dunedin to their final site.
The wind farm generated its first electricity on 21 February 2011, with the first two turbines being commissioned. All twelve stage one turbines were completed and generating electricity by the end of March 2011.
Location.
The wind farm will be contained within of land at an elevation of 600 to 730 meters above sea level and about 50 kilometres west of Dunedin. Most of the land in the proposed site is pasture grazed by sheep and cattle.
Transmission.
Electricity generated from Stage 1 turbines will be injected into TrustPower's nearby Deep Stream and Waipori hydro schemes. This allows the wind turbines to operate in synergy with the hydro schemes, allowing water to be preserved during off-peak times while the wind farm is generating. Electricity from Stage 1 and the hydro schemes is then injected into either Dunedin's local distribution network, or into Transpower's Halfway Bush-Balclutha-Gore 110 kV line at Berwick.
Stage 2 and beyond is too large to inject into the Waipori/Deep Stream system. Instead, it will inject into Transpower's Halfway Bush-Roxburgh 110 kV line, which passes a short distance south of the wind farm.

Angus Morrison Gidney (May 4, 1803 – January 20, 1882) was a Canadian educator, poet and journalist.
He was born in Jemseg, New Brunswick, the son of Joshua Gidney and Phoebe Morrison. The family settled on a farm near Bridgetown, Nova Scotia while he was still young. Gidney taught school for a number of years before becoming editor of the "Novascotian" in 1843; later that year, he became associate editor after William Annand purchased the paper. He was also parliamentary reporter for the "Morning Chronicle". Gidney married Experience Beals. In 1845, he purchased the "Yarmouth Herald". In 1859, after temporarily leaving journalism, he became editor for the "Digby Acadian". In 1862, he joined his son Ingraham at the Bridgetown "Register", later renamed the "Free Press". Gidney was the author of "The refugee's daughter: a legend", a novel, parts of which were published in instalments in the "Nova Scotian"; it was later published in full in the "Liverpool Transcript". He also contributed poetry to local periodicals in the province. Gidney was sergeant-at-arms for the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1868 to 1878. He also served as postmaster at Bridgetown for a short time. He died in Bridgetown at the age of 78.

Duncan Falconer

Duncan Falconer is the pseudonym of an author and former Special Boat Service commando. As a child, he was raised in an orphanage in North London before being adopted by a family from Battersea.
Military career.
Falconer joined the British Royal Marines at the age of 18. At 19 years of age, he attended SBS selection in Poole Dorset and was one of nine Marines to successfully complete the course out of 147 men. Most candidates are required to serve some time in a Commando unit before applying, however Duncan was given an exception. Later he was posted to 42 Commando as a career broadening opportunity. 
Falconer served the majority of his military service with the SBS. During his time in the military, he also served with the SAS, and 14 Intelligence Detachment, deployed to Northern Ireland with each for one year and two and a half years respectively. After he left the Detachment he took a sabbatical for a year before returning to the SBS where he was posted to MAT ("Maritime Anti-Terrorism") operations in which he was involved in a number of exercises retaking oil rigs and tankers.
After the SBS.
After leaving the SBS Falconer spent two years working for a private security company.
Falconer had planned to move to Central America, to specialise in Kidnap & Ransom negotiation work, but, whilst in Los Angeles he wrote his first screenplay which he sold weeks later. As a result, Falconer chose to remain in LA for more than a decade whilst pursuing two careers - one as a screenplay writer, the other as a private security risk consultant. He also spent several years working as a bartender to 'learn American' while writing screenplays and TV. Whilst living in LA Falconer also wrote his autobiography.
After September 11 attacks Falconer returned to the UK and joined a private security company based in Hereford. There he worked as a hostile environment instructor and security consultant for journalists, operating in many countries including Africa, the Middle East, Asia and South America.
His autobiography, and first literary publication, "First into Action" included accounts of the actions carried out by the SBS and 14 Intelligence Detachment. The tone of this work was in contrast to a number of biographies of other ex-special forces personnel at the time - the tales not just about the heroic actions of those he served alongside, but also showed the more humorous, realistic side of the troops. The book also highlighted the rivalry and antagonism between the "Special Boat Service" and Special Air Service and the history behind their conflict. 
Such was the success of the book, Time Warner publishing contracted Falconer to write two military-based novels. The protagonist in these initial novels was "John Stratton", created in the author's image and sharing a similar career path within the military, as an SBS operative and operating with an Intelligence Detachment in Northern Ireland. The vast majority of his work to date has retained Stratton as the central character. In "The Protector" Falconer introduced a new central character, "Bernie Mallory". Mallory again has been crafted in the image of his creator, this time as a former Royal Marine turned private security contractor.
Falconer moved to South Africa, then Dubai where he consulted on 'fuel and food' convoy moves across Afghanistan. Falconer moved back to Europe and also South Africa where he is a maritime and crisis management consultant for a UK-based security company.
Falconer continues to write books and screenplays.

Masuiyama Daishirō I

Masuiyama Daishirō (3 November 1919 – 21 October 1985) was a sumo wrestler from Himeji, Hyōgo, Japan. His highest rank was "ōzeki." After his retirement he was the head coach of Mihogaseki stable and produced "yokozuna" Kitanoumi among other wrestlers.
Career.
Born Kumiaki Sawaka, he joined Dewanoumi stable in 1935 and initially fought under the "shikona" of Hamanishiki, before changing to Masuiyama in 1937. After winning the "makushita" tournament championship or "yūshō" in 1939 he was promoted to "jūryō" and only two tournaments later, after picking up another championship, he was promoted to the top "makuuchi" division for the January 1941 tournament. In January 1942 he defeated "yokozuna" Haguroyama to earn his first gold star or "kinboshi." He finished with a losing record but good performances over the next three tournaments took him to "komusubi" and then "sekiwake" in 1944. In the first postwar tournament held in a bomb-damaged Kokugikan in June 1945 he could manage only two wins and dropped back to the "maegashira" ranks, but he was runner-up to Haguroyama in November 1946 with a fine 11-2 record. After earning his first "sanshō" or special prize for Technique he returned to the "san'yaku" ranks, and in October 1948 he won his first top division championship. He took advantage of the poor condition of the three "yokozuna" and finished with a 10-1 record, defeating "ōzeki" Azumafuji in a playoff. After the tournament Azumafuji was promoted to "yokozuna" and Masuiyama was elevated to "ōzeki". In his second tournament at "ōzeki" rank Masuiyama took his second and final championship, defeating "yokozuna" Haguroyama, Azumafuji and Maedayama on three consecutive days to finish 13-2. He defeated "maegashira" Hajimayama, a fellow member of Dewanoumi stable, in another playoff on the final day.
Retirement from sumo.
This was to be the last tourney Masuiyama was to complete. After pulling out of the next two tournaments through injury he retired in January 1950 at the age of 30, having spent only four tournaments at "ōzeki" rank. He became head coach of the small Mihogaseki stable. After a long period without success, he eventually managed to produce some strong sekitori, including Kitanoumi who reached "yokozuna" in 1974, and his eldest son, Masuiyama Daishiro II, who was born in 1948, entered his father's stable in 1967 alongside Kitanoumi and reached the "ōzeki" rank in 1980. In November 1984 Masuiyama reached the mandatory retirement age set by the Japan Sumo Association and passed on control of Mihogaseki stable to his son. He died less than one year later. Kitanoumi, his most successful wrestler, missed his own father's funeral to attend Masuiyama's.

<doc id="18659441" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18659441" title="Herschel–Bulkley fluid">
Herschel–Bulkley fluid

The Herschel–Bulkley fluid is a generalized model of a non-Newtonian fluid, in which the strain experienced by the fluid is related to the stress in a complicated, non-linear way. Three parameters characterize this relationship: the consistency "k", the flow index "n", and the yield shear stress formula_1. The consistency is a simple constant of proportionality, while the flow index measures the degree to which the fluid is shear-thinning or shear-thickening. Ordinary paint is one example of a shear-thinning fluid, while oobleck provides one realization of a shear-thickening fluid. Finally, the yield stress quantifies the amount of stress that the fluid may experience before it yields and begins to flow.
This non-Newtonian fluid model was introduced by Herschel and Bulkley in 1926.
Definition.
The viscous stress tensor is given, in the usual way, as a viscosity, multiplied by the rate-of-strain tensor:
where in contrast to the Newtonian fluid, the viscosity is itself a function of the strain tensor. This is constituted through the formula 
where formula_4 is the second invariant of the rate-of-strain tensor:
If "n"=1 and formula_6, this model reduces to the Newtonian fluid. If formula_7 the fluid is shear-thinning, while formula_8 produces a shear-thickening fluid. The limiting viscosity formula_9 is chosen such that formula_10. A large limiting viscosity means that the fluid will only flow in response to a large applied force. This feature captures the Bingham-type behaviour of the fluid.
This equation is also commonly written as
where formula_12 is the shear stress, formula_13 the shear rate, formula_14 the yield stress, and K and n are regarded as model factors.
Channel flow.
A frequently-encountered situation in experiments is pressure-driven channel flow (see diagram). This situation exhibits an equilibrium in which there is flow only in the horizontal direction (along the pressure-gradient direction), and the pressure gradient and viscous effects are in balance. Then, the Navier-Stokes equations, together with the rheological model, reduce to a single equation:
To solve this equation it is necessary to non-dimensionalize the quantities involved. The channel depth "H" is chosen as a length scale, the mean velocity "V" is taken as a velocity scale, and the pressure scale is taken to be formula_16. This analysis introduces the non-dimensional pressure gradient
formula_17
which is negative for flow from left to right, and the Bingham number:
Next, the domain of the solution is broken up into three parts, valid for a negative pressure gradient:
Solving this equation gives the velocity profile:
formula_22
Here "k" is a matching constant such that formula_23 is continuous. The profile respects the no-slip conditions at the channel boundaries,
Using the same continuity arguments, it is shown that formula_25, where
formula_26
Since formula_27, for a given formula_28 pair, there is a critical pressure gradient
formula_29
Apply any pressure gradient smaller in magnitude than this critical value, and the fluid will not flow; its Bingham nature is thus apparent. Any pressure gradient greater in magnitude than this critical value will result in flow. The flow associated with a shear-thickening fluid is retarded relative to that associated with a shear-thinning fluid.
Pipe flow.
For laminar flow Chilton and Stainsby provide the following equation to calculate the pressure drop. The equation requires an iterative solution to extract the pressure drop, as it is present on both sides of the equation.
allows standard Newtonian friction factor correlations to be used.

SS Ville du Havre

Ville du Havre was a French iron steamship that operated round trips between the northern coast of France and New York. Launched in 1866 under her original name of "Napoléon III", she was converted from a paddle steamer to single propeller propulsion in 1871 and renamed "Ville du Havre".
In the early hours of 22 November 1873, "Ville du Havre" collided with the Scottish three-masted iron clipper, "Loch Earn" and sank in 12 minutes with the loss of 226 lives. Only 61 passengers and 26 crew members survived, rescued by "Loch Earn" and subsequently, an American vessel, the "Tremountain".
History and description.
The "Napoleon III" was originally built as a paddle steamer by Thames Ironworks, London (engines by Ravenshill & Salked, London) in late 1865 for the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (French Line). She was a 3,950 gross ton ship, length 365.9ft with 45.9ft beam, straight stem, two funnels, two masts, iron construction, paddle wheel propulsion and a cruising speed of 11.5 knots.
There was accommodation for 170 first class, 100 second class and 50 third class passengers. Launched in November 1865, she sailed on her maiden voyage from Havre for Brest and New York on 26 April 1866. She made five round voyages on this service, the last commencing in August 1869.
In September 1871, she sailed from Havre to Tyneside in Northern England where she was lengthened to 421.7ft by A. Leslie and Company, Hebburn-on-Tyne and her tonnage increased to 5,065 tons. She was also fitted with compound steam engines and rebuilt with single screw propulsion, and the paddle wheel was removed. A third mast was also fitted and after completion of the works she was renamed "Ville du Havre". Following sea trials, she recommenced her Havre – Brest – New York service in early 1873.
Final voyage and sinking.
On 15 November 1873, the "Ville du Havre" sailed from New York with 313 passengers and crew on board, under the command of Captain Marino Surmonte. After a week's steaming across the Atlantic ocean, she collided with the iron clipper, "Loch Earn" at about 2am on the morning of Saturday, 22 November at the position . At the time of the collision, "Ville du Havre" was proceeding under both steam and sail at about 12 knots.
The Captain of the "Loch Earn", after first sighting the "Ville du Havre" and realising she was dangerously close, rang the ship's bell and ported his helm. The helm of the "Loch Earn" was put to starboard, but "Ville du Havre" came right across the "Loch Earn's" bow. The "Ville du Havre" was violently shaken by the collision and noise, and woke all the passengers. Confused, most passengers went on deck, only to discover the ship was rapidly sinking. The captain assured them that all was fine, but in reality the cruiser had been nearly broken in two, and it didn't take long for passengers to realize the situation was desperate. Commotion and chaos overtook panicked passengers. They started grabbing life preservers and trying to push lifeboats into the water. Unfortunately, these had recently been painted, and they were now stuck fast to the deck. Finally a few of them were yanked loose, and passengers fought desperately to be one of the few travelers to board those rescue boats.
Shortly after the collision, "Ville du Havre's" main and mizzen masts collapsed, smashing two of the liner's life boats and killing several people. The time for saving life was very short as the ship sank in less than 12 minutes, and finally broke into two pieces as she went. Captain Robertson of the "Loch Earn" did all he possibly could to rescue the drowning and eventually 61 passengers and 26 of the crew were rescued and taken on board that ship. However, 226 passengers and crew perished.
The "Loch Earn", herself in danger of sinking, was subsequently rescued by the American cargo ship, "Tremountain" and all "Ville du Havre" passengers and crew were transferred to that ship. The "Loch Earn", with its bow smashed in, commenced to sink as the bulkheads gave way, so she was abandoned at sea by her crew and sank shortly afterwards.
Notable passengers.
Rufus Wheeler Peckham, a judge and congressman from New York, was on board and lost his life. Travelling with his second wife, Mary, the couple were en route to southern France to improve his failing health. Peckham's last words were reported to be ""Wife, we have to die, let us die bravely"." His remains were never recovered, and his cenotaph (pictured) was erected at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.
Also on the ship was young Princeton graduate Hamilton Murray, his sister Martha, and their friend Mrs C.A. Platt. All three were lost. The Hamilton Murray theater at Princeton (longtime home of Theatre Intime) is named in his honor.
Although Horatio Spafford was not a passenger on board "Ville du Havre", his wife (Anna) and four daughters were. At the last moment Horatio was detained by real estate business, so Anna and the girls went on ahead for Paris. After the collision, a fellow survivor, Pastor Weiss, recalled Anna saying, ""God gave me four daughters. Now they have been taken from me. Someday I will understand why"". Anna was picked up unconscious, floating on a plank of wood, by the crew of the "Loch Earn", which itself was in danger of sinking. Fortunately, the "Tremountain", a cargo sailing vessel, arrived to save the survivors.
Nine days after the shipwreck Anna landed in Cardiff, Wales, and cabled Horatio, ""Saved alone. What shall I do" . . .". After receiving Anna's telegram, Horatio immediately left Chicago to bring his wife home. On the Atlantic crossing, the captain of his ship called Horatio to his cabin to tell him that they were passing over the spot where his four daughters had perished. He wrote to Rachel, his wife's half-sister, "On Thursday last we passed over the spot where she went down, in mid-ocean, the waters three miles deep. But I do not think of our dear ones there. They are safe, folded, the dear lambs". Horatio later wrote the famous hymn "It Is Well with My Soul", commemorating his daughters. Philip Bliss, who composed the music for the hymn, called his tune "Ville du Havre", after the name of the stricken vessel.

Markham &amp; Co.

Markham & Co. is an ironworks and steelworks company near Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England.
History.
The Victoria Foundry near Chesterfield, Derbyshire was owned and run by William Oliver and his father John Oliver from the mid-1850s until 1862 when, following the death of the father, it became the sole property of William. The Victoria Foundry, located at what was formerly Shepley's Yard, relocated to a greenfield site at Broad Oaks Meadows, south east of the town centre close by the Midland Railway’s main line. Disaster hit the business in 1885, a slump in the coal and iron trades and the high overheads of the new factory and equipment undermined the firm and the following year Oliver called in the receivers. In 1889 the business was sold to industrialist Charles Paxton Markham and became Markham & Co. Ltd.
Mining. Markham's continued the business of building winding engines for collieries begun by Oliver and supplied many collieries in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. So well known were Markham's products that in the ten years from 1927, in a time of economic depression, the Markham works built 20 winding engines for gold mines in South Africa, giving the Chesterfield workforce regular work in a difficult period.
By 1948 the company had built more than 200 steam and electric winding engines and associated machinery for the home and export markets including a mine winder with a 34 feet diameter drum, 7 feet larger than the ones which made William Oliver move to new premises.
The company diversified over the years and in 1948 the Broad Oaks works were making haulage gears, rolling mills and ancillary equipment, steel girders, large steel-framed buildings, light alloy extrusion presses, spun cast iron plant, blast furnace plant, large iron castings and research equipment in addition to its involvement in turbine and tunnelling operations.
Tunnelling. In the early years of the 20th century the company built and supplied tunnelling equipment for the construction of London's new (deep tunnel) Underground, the Mersey Tunnel and during the 1930s the Moscow Underground. The tunnelling equipment was a success and more orders followed, post-war productions included tunnelling shields for the Dartford Tunnel under the River Thames and in the 1980s for the Channel Tunnel.
War Time works During the Second World War the firm worked on several secret projects including building X craft submarines for Vickers-Armstrong. They built X22 "Exploit", X 23 "Xphias", XE 11 "Lucifer", XE 12 "Excitable". Others were built by Marshalls of Gainsborough and Broadbent of Huddersfield.
Markhams built a large number of presses for Loewy during the war for other firms making components for the war effort, as well as gun barrel turning lathes and riffling machines for Cravens Ltd, a sister company.
Company Sold.
In 1925 Charles Paxton Markham reconstituted his company as part of the Staveley Coal and Iron Company ensuring its future. The following year Charles Paxton Markham died and ownership of the company changed again. By 1937 the firm had been bought by Sheffield-based steel makers and engineers John Brown & Company for £50,000, the Chesterfield works continuing operations as before. John Brown was taken over by Trafalgar House, who also owned the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company. Trafalgar House was subsequently taken over by the Kvaerner Group of Norway in 1996. The works was closed by Kvaerner in 1998 and the site redeveloped for housing following a sale by the firm who took over John Brown's parent company.
The company is now merged with former Trafalgar House engineering subsidiary Davy in Sheffield to form Davy Markham, and specialises in large engineering fabrications and machining works, from the Davy site in Sheffield. Davy Markham worked on the fabrication of the "B of the Bang" sculpture installed outside the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England. This was the tallest sculpture in the UK until it was dismantled.

Fernand Meyssonnier

Fernand Meyssonnier (1931–2008) was an executioner in the last years of French Algeria. He acted as an executioner from 1947 to 1961 and executed more than 200. 
He inherited the job of executioner from his father Maurice Meyssonnier in 1947 when he ended compulsory education. His ancestors had been executioners from ages ago. When Algeria became independent from France in 1961, the guillotine was replaced by execution by firing squad.
In 1961, shortly before Algerian independence, Fernand Meyssonnier went to Tahiti where he met his future wife with whom he had a daughter, and founded several businesses. After his retirement, he went to metropolitan France. He bought a house in Fontaine-de-Vaucluse where he died on August 8, 2008.
Meyssonnier has been sometimes errorously refeered to as the "last (French) executioner alive", while not only he never officially assumed the post, but he died the same year as Marcel Chevalier, the last French Chief Executioner, who served from 1976 to 1977.

Brigadier Ronnie Stonham was the Special Assistant to the Director of Personnel at the BBC until 1985 who was caught up in the scandal over MI5 monitoring of potential staff. He occupied Room 105 at Broadcasting House in London, UK from 1982, following his departure from the Army, until October 1988.
The Director of Personnel during Stonham's tenure at the BBC was Christopher Martin. Stonham's role was to liaise with MI5 regarding whether candidates for roles at the broadcasting corporation had suspicious political connections, particularly with communism.
Sir Hugh Greene, a former Director-General of the BBC, said about Security Service vetting of BBC job applicants:
I was vetted in 1940. MI5 thought I was a Communist but it turned out to be a mistake.
Michael Grade, at the time Controller of BBC One and later Chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC, also commented on the existence of Room 105, where Brigadier Stonham was based:
I don't know about room 105, but it does sound like a good title for a drama series.
Film rights.
Talks over making the story of the operations of Room 105 into a film are scheduled, although exact details have yet to be released.
The episode involving Stonham, MI5, the BBC and several employees was written up in the Observer and in a book by Mark Hollingsworth and Richard Norton-Taylor. The relevant chapter in the book is here:

<doc id="18659861" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18659861" title="Session Jam">
Session Jam

Session-jam is a term commonly used in Bangladesh to refer to the failure of several public universities to graduate students according to schedule, due to lengthy closures occasioned by politically motivated violence. Students in public universities in Bangladesh might finish their degrees months to years after their compatriots studying in private universities, where session-jams usually do not occur. The problem is becoming gradually decreasing in recent years.
Reasons.
The only cause of session jam is, failing to complete the scheduled classes in time. But this failure is caused by several other reasons.
Though not as high as 80s, politics of Bangladesh is often reactive, confrontational and violent. Several student organizations act as the armament of the political parties they are part of. So every now and then there are affrays and commotions. To check those hitches universities have no options but go to lengthy and unexpected closures. So classes are not completed on time and there are session jams.
Drawbacks.
Many students receives their degree latter than their schedules time frame. In actual time, this appears as a career break. However, the student was attending the school at that time. May people in other countries cannot easily understand this painful story the students before explain.
An example: Mr. Abdul Karim was a student of geology (four-year bachelor course) admitted to the university in the year 2000 (July). He should complete his first year exam on June 2001 and promoted to second year. In this way he should complete his final exam before June 2004. However, none of his courses and exams were completed on time. He finally completed his final exam on September 2005. Thus, even though his certificates shows he is a graduate of 2004, actually he completed his course in 2005. Therefore, many sufferer mention 'held in year' after his actual year of passing. In this case Mr Karim writes Graduation year 2004 (held in 2005). This is unfortunate but true for thousands of students.

Kfar Masaryk

Kfar Masaryk (, "lit." Masaryk Village) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located in the western Galilee near the Belus River and south of Acre, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Asher Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 598.
The founders were immigrants from Czechoslovakia and Lithuania and had settled in Petah Tikva in 1932. The following year they formed "Kibbutz Czecho-Lita" and moved to Bat Galim in Haifa. In 1934 they moved to an area of sand dunes near Kiryat Haim and changed the name of the group to "Mishmar Zevulun" (Guard of the Zevulun). In 1937 they were joined by a group of Polish immigrants who were members of "Hayotzer". 
Despite opposition from the Jewish Agency (who reasoned that the sandy soil could not support agriculture), Mishmar Zevulun was established on 29 November 1938 as the 29th tower and stockade settlement. In 1940 the kibbutz moved to its present site and was renamed Kfar Masaryk after Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the first President of Czechoslovakia

Jean-Baptiste Mockey (14 April 1915 – 29 January 1981) was an Ivorian politician. He was Deputy Prime Minister under Félix Houphouët-Boigny. Despite this, radical nationalists, led by Mockey, openly opposed the government's Francophile policies. To solve this problem, Houphouët-Boigny decided to get rid of Mockey by exiling him in September 1959, claiming that Mockey had attempted to assassinate him using maleficent fetishes in the ""complot du chat noir"" (black cat conspiracy).

Pier Paolo Maggiora

Pier Paolo Maggiora, is an Italian architect.
Biography.
He was born in 1943 in Saluzzo. In Turin he got the Master of Arts degree with Carlo Mollino.
Apprenticeship in the ateliers of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Carlo Scarpa, Oscar Niemeyer and Kenzo Tange.
In 1967 Pier Paolo Maggiora opens his own practice in Turin and few later he founds The Studio ArchA.
In the following years, during the post-industrial and environmental/infrastructure crisis, he develops some project proposals which involve, starting from architecture, environmental, land and urban aspects, which lead to his theory of “architectural territory”.
That is an idea of territory that is thought of in his organic and wider efficiency - cultural, social, economic, functional and aesthetic – as an attractive pole that spread of dynamic and creative energy.
Dialogue in Architecture.
In the 1980s he laid down the foundations of his theory for a "Dialogue in Architecture", for the promotion of creative projects between architects and, at the same time, to restore the charm of the unitarian diversity, which has created layers over the centuries in the historic city.
His professional activity is based on this general concept of Architecture and its role in civil society, and is expressed in a big number of projects and works, where the theory is embodied in structures, masses, surfaces, facilities.
In the convergence of stimulus and information from different disciplines (ecology, anthropology, urban planning, engineering, sociology, economics, management and finance) is defined, through his whole work, the architectural synthesis where philosophical principles are called to interwine in forms and functions offered to the social fruition.
Projects.
The following are some of the latest projects:
Quote.
"In the first place, there is a factor that unifies Pier Paolo Maggiora’s architecture and outlines its cultural essence, even before its style. In fact, it is not only universally acknowledged as urban architecture that fits in perfectly with the social and visual context it is meant for, but also – and especially – as metropolitan architecture. This means it is intended to redesign the context that hosts it, so as to relaunch it into a wider perspective of new functions and new images.
From this point of view, Maggiora’s work fits into a leading-edge trend of contemporary design culture, which sees architecture as a social service that is capable of participating in a project for collective existence. In all of the Turinese architect’s main works, the urban territory is immediately configured as the grounds for an organized and planned development thanks to the presence of an architectural artefact. Indeed, in its perfect functional efficiency, the latter sets itself as an attraction that radiates dynamic and creative potential."

Jean Konan Banny

Jean Konan Banny (born May 11, 1930) is an Ivorian politician of the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire (PDCI). He is the brother of Charles Konan Banny, a former Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire.
A lawyer, Banny served as Minister of Defense for Côte d'Ivoire from its independence in 1960 to 1963. In 1963, he was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death on charges of participating in President Félix Houphouët-Boigny's ""complot du chat noir"" (black cat conspiracy). Meanwhile, his office was transferred to Kouadio M'Bahia Blé whose ministership lasted more than 17 years. There was discontent in the army, as the generals stirred following his arrest and Houphouët-Boigny had to intervene personally to sedate the army. 
Banny, who personally knew Houphouët-Boigny from childhood, was pardoned and released in 1967. He asked Banny to be the mayor of Yamoussoukro, though Houphouët-Boigny's successor, Henri Konan Bédié, appointed Banny as Resident Minister of the capital. The Resident Minister is a member of the Council of Elders of the PDCI, which includes roughly a hundred elders. 
He also directs the "Société fruitière du Bandama", an industrial company, which produces and exports fruit juice, mainly that of pineapples. The company created the popular drink Cristelor in 1983. Described as a "delice d'ananas petillant," French for sparkling pineapple delight, it is popularly called pineapple champagne. Banny claimed the idea "came to when he thought to make a wine from pineapples" and was named after his granddaughter Cristel. He also proposed an alcoholic version of the drink.

<doc id="18660105" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18660105" title="Candlewick (Pinocchio character)">
Candlewick (Pinocchio character)

Candlewick () is a fictional character who appears in Carlo Collodi's book "The Adventures of Pinocchio" ("Le avventure di Pinocchio").
Role.
Candlewick is introduced in chapter XXX. His real name is Romeo, though he is given his nickname on account of his slender, polished build. He is described as the most unruly of Pinocchio’s class, though he is the puppet’s best friend. He refuses Pinocchio’s invitation to a party celebrating his upcoming transformation into a real boy, and persuades the puppet to instead come with him to the Land of Toys (Paese dei Balocchi), where education and study are nonexistent. The two are transported to the Land of Toys by The Coachman, and spend their days indulging in play and idleness. After five months, both of them awake with donkey ears, which they conceal with tall caps. The two are reluctant to admit their condition to each other, but after some coaxing, they simultaneously remove their caps and laugh at each other. Their laughter soon turns to animal brayings and the two transform into a pair of donkeys. While Pinocchio is sold to a circus ringleader, Candlewick is sold to a farmer who makes him work at a water mill. In a later chapter, Pinocchio is sold to a drummer who attempts to drown the donkey in order to skin his hide and use it to make his drum. The man is then surprised that instead of finding a dead donkey, he sees Pinocchio who says the fish ate away at all his donkey skin.
Pinocchio and Candlewick meet again in chapter XXXVI, where it is revealed that Candlewick is dying from exhaustion. Pinocchio, now returned to normal, temporarily takes on Candlewick's job of doing farm work, and is laughed at when he reveals to Candlewick's owner that he went to school with the animal. Candlewick dies from exhaustion not long after.
Alternative Versions.
This unwritten type of the story that was not shown in the book, that when Candlewick dies from exhaustion, his donkey form was turned back into human.
Adaptations.
He also appeared in Walt Disney's 1940 adaptation of "Pinocchio", where Candlewick is renamed Lampwick and is voiced by Frankie Darro. Like his literary version, he is tall and slender, and sports red hair and buckteeth. It is believed that one of the chief animators of the character, Fred Moore, had added the red hair and overbite to Lampwick as a caricature of himself. Lampwick also made a cameo in "House of Mouse", and also makes a cameo in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" appearing on a poster advertising for "exploding cigars" in Toontown, with his donkey ears from the original film. A live action Lampwick has often starred in Disneyland's Electrical Parade along with an unnamed boy from Pleasure Island. Lampwick and the other boy have tails and donkey ears and wave to guests at Disneyland.
Lampwick appears in "Un burattino di nome Pinocchio" a 1972 Italian animated adaptation of "Pinocchio". He is portrayed like the original story: a lazy boy who dislikes school and convinces Pinocchio to come to the Land of Toys with him. They play many games and eat junk food and go on amusement rides. Eventually he and Pinocchio transform into donkeys and are sold to a farmer and a circus. Near the end of the film, Pinocchio finds Lampwick heavily wounded and exhausted from overwork at the farm and he volunteers to do his work until he feels better, but it is too late and Lampwick dies from his wounds.
In the 1993 direct-to-video adaptation by GoodTimes Entertainment, Candlewick is portrayed like his Disney counterpart, Lampwick with red hair, though he doesn't have buckteeth, who tries to have fun in Dunceland with Pinocchio. Like his Disney counterpart, he is transformed into a donkey and his fate is unknown.
Lampwick appears in the 1996 film "The Adventures of Pinocchio", portrayed by Corey Carrier as a boy whom Pinocchio meets at school and later convinces him to come with him to Terra Magica, where they are allowed to do whatever they please. Eventually, they and a few other boys ride a roller coaster. During the ride, they are splashed with enchanted water which turns them into animals based on their nature. Lampwick and the bad boys turn into donkeys, while Pinocchio only grows donkey ears. They are later corralled by Lorenzini, who fulfills the roles of both the Puppeteer and the Coachman. Pinocchio escapes and sets the other boys free. During their escape, the donkey Lampwick kicks Lorenzini into the sea, turning him into a whale. Close to the end of the movie, the donkey Lampwick is seen pulling Geppetto, Pinocchio and Leona on a carriage. Lampwick, along with the other donkeys, returns to human form by doing good deeds. He can be seen playing with the human Pinocchio before the end credits. He calls Pinocchio "Woody" throughout the entire film.
Lampwick appeared again in the 1999 sequel "The New Adventures of Pinocchio" in which he is played by British actor Ben Ridgeway replacing Corey Carrier. In the film, he and Pinocchio are given a potion by Madame Flambeau (who is secretly Lorenzini in the form of a woman). After they drink the potion, Pinocchio and Geppetto are turned into puppets, while Lampwick is turned into a sea donkey fish and is put in a barrel of water after Lorenzini captures them. Later, they jump into the magical enchanted water and turn back into humans while Lorenzini is turned into a sea monster. Lampwick and Pinocchio later meet a girl who they invite to come and watch Geppetto performing on the theatre stage at the end of the film.
Lampwick appears in the 2002 feature film "Pinocchio" portrayed by Kim Rossi Stewart while his English dub voice was provided by Topher Grace. In the English version, he is named Leonardo. He first meets Pinocchio in prison after Pinocchio was cheated by the Fox and the Cat, teaching him what lollipop he licks, which is tangerine, and then they meet again after Pinocchio is kidnapped by a farmer in order to replace a dog that died. During that time, Lampwick attempts to steal chickens. Later, he entices Pinocchio to join him at the Land of Toys, where bad boys turn into donkeys. He turns into a donkey and is sold to a farmer. When Pinocchio goes to work for the same farmer after he and Geppetto escape from the Giant Shark, he finds Lampwick's donkey form dying from exhaustion.
Lampwick appears in the 2008 "Pinocchio" miniseries, played by Thomas Sangster. The miniseries is more faithful to the book; Lampwick has a much bigger role than in the Disney film, and he dies toward the end.

Formula One Teams Association

The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) was a group of Formula One teams that formed at a meeting in Maranello on 29 July 2008. This organisation was formed to give the teams a united voice in their ongoing discussions with the FIA and the Formula One Group regarding the future of Formula One. It was headed by McLaren Team Principal Martin Whitmarsh, who was appointed in December 2009. The first task of FOTA was to negotiate the terms of the new Concorde Agreement, the commercial contract which governs the championship.
The group also discussed the proposal to the FIA for the Formula One regulations for the 2011 Formula One season. Team Principal of the Mercedes team, Ross Brawn, had offered his services to co-ordinate this activity.
Budget Cap Row.
In May 2009, the FOTA teams announced their intention not to sign up for the 2010 championship until the FIA agreed to change the proposed regulations. FOTA disagreed with several of the proposals, the most contentious being the introduction of a £40m budget cap. With the 29 May deadline approaching the Williams and Force India teams broke ranks, lodged their applications for 2010 and were promptly suspended from FOTA. Following lengthy discussions, on the evening of 18 June 2009, FOTA announced a breakaway "Grand Prix World Championship" series from F1. The WilliamsF1 and Force India teams would not participate in the breakaway series because of their contractual obligation with the FIA. However, on 24 June 2009, FOTA reached agreement with the FIA over the 2010 season rules and ergo dropped their plans for the break-away series.
On 8 July 2009 the eight FOTA teams walked out of a meeting with the FIA to discuss 2010 rules at the Nürburgring. They accused the FIA of putting the sport in jeopardy. A FOTA press release clamied that Charlie Whiting informed them that all eight FOTA teams were not entered in the 2010 championship, even though the FOTA members were included on the “accepted” entry list as endorsed by the FIA World Motor Sport Council and communicated by a FIA press statement on June 24. FOTA tried to postpone the July 8 meeting, this was rejected on the grounds that no new Concorde Agreement would be permitted before a unanimous approval of the 2010 regulations was achieved.
However, it was clear to the FOTA teams that the basis of the 2010 technical and sporting regulations was already established in Paris. As endorsed by the WMSC and clearly stated in the FIA press statement of 24 June “the rules for 2010 onwards will be the 2009 regulations as well as further regulations agreed prior to 29 April 2009”. At no point in the Paris discussions was any requirement for unanimous agreement on regulations change expressed.
As a result of these statements, the FOTA representatives at the subsequent Technical Working Group were not able to exercise their rights and therefore had no option other than to terminate their participation.
Nevertheless, the involved parties were able to sign a new Concorde Agreement, agree on resource restrictions and new sporting and technical regulations for the season at a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council on July 31, 2009. All of the FOTA teams signed the new Concorde Agreement except for BMW Sauber, which had announced its withdrawal from the sport at the end of 2009 two days previously.
On 9 September 2009 FOTA held a meeting in Monza and re-admitted both Williams and Force India into full membership. On 26 November 2009 it was confirmed that the final two "new" teams were to join FOTA, meaning all 12 teams participating in the 2010 Formula One season were members of the organisation. In December 2010, however, Hispania Racing left the organisation. A spokesperson was quoted as citing the politics of the association favouring the larger teams as the reason for the team's departure. However, the FOTA's secretary-general, Simone Perillo, said that the team was expelled because it had not paid its 2010 annual membership fee of €100,000. Red Bull Racing, Scuderia Ferrari and Sauber pulled out of FOTA in early December 2011.
Disbanding.
In February 2014 it was announced that FOTA had been disbanded. The organisation's Secretary General Oliver Weingarten cited a lack of funds and "a lack of consensus among all the teams on a revised, non-contentious mandate" as being the reasons for the dissolving of the organisation.
Member teams.
At the time of its disbanding, the association consisted of the following teams.

Chelyabinsk Trade Center

Chelyabinsk Trade Center () is a building on the embankment of the Miass River in Chelyabinsk, Russia, built in 1975. The Trade Center silhouette became one of the symbols of the city.
The main square building (side size is 102 meters) is covered by the dome, which is supported only by the columns on its edges. The dome itself is made of 1500 reinforced concrete shells, tightened together with metal cables. Total weight of the dome is above 5000 tons. Dome edge piers can move, allowing the whole construction to "breathe" (expand or contract) depending on the outside temperature (temperature in Chelyabinsk can be as low as –40°C in winter and +40°C in summer). The design of the Trade Center (developed by Leningrad Project Institute Number One) received positive reviews during exhibitions in Moscow, London and New York in 1974-1978.
Today there are several mid-size retail outlets in the Trade Center (selling food, electronic devices), with the large portion of the space occupied by small outlets (clothes, DIY, home appliances and others). Total retail and warehouse area is 18000 m².
The metro station with the same name is being built near the Trade Center.

Marketing research process

The market research process involves a round of separate stages of data interpretation, organization and collection. These stages could be considered as a benchmark of market research, but it depends on an organization how they have encapsulated their strategies to follow this process. Hence some of the interlinked stages could be conducted repeatedly and some of the stages can also be omitted. Given below is a typical market research process which is depicted stage-wise:
Defining the Problem or Need- The starting phase is always identifying the reason or problem for which research is to be conducted. This includes collecting of relevant initial information and how this information will affect decision making process. It also includes defining problems after discussing with decision makers of the organization. Once the problem is defined precisely and the need of research is discussed, the further process could be conducted in an efficient manner.
Determining who will do the research- Once the initial stage of defining the problem and the need of research is done, it is important to determine who will do the research and what will be the approaches to resolve these problems. This involves creating a problem solving framework and analytical models after discussing with organization experts. In this sample case studies are created according to the defined framework by enforcing the relevant information and secondary data.
Picking out the appropriate methodology- A specific methodology is entailed by the research professional after identifying the specific needs and exploring the case studies. It may include a combination of specific approaches like telephone survey, web or email survey, one-to-one interviews, secondary research etc. This methodology acts as a blueprint of research process and following basic steps:
Data Collection Process- This process includes field work and desk work for collecting all relevant data and information. Field work includes interviewing the personals by interacting them face to face by visiting them in home or offices or arranging group meetings at any preferred place. Desk work includes contacting personals over telephone or via series of emails and web meetings. This could take comparatively more time as compared to the field work. Involving experienced and trained executive for this helps in reducing data collection errors.
Data Preparation, tabulation and analysis of results- After the data collecting stage the collected data is edited, corrected if required and validated. This process is the most important process in the research as the results are generated on the basis of data preparation. So it is required for an organization to verify the authenticity of the collected data and edit or correct it if needed. The final data is then segmented according to the business standards and inserted into the CRM database in a more tabulated form so that search or combination could be made easily.
- The entire process is properly documented with respect to organizational standards so that it can be referred in future for decision making process or to change or modify any specific process or module. This document contains overall architecture of the project depicting all the processes with the help of tables, graphs and figures to provoke impact and clarity.
Market Research undeniably plays a vital role in exploring the business. The above process if conducted in an efficient manner could help predicting and correlating customer needs and then modeling or modifying the business strategies accordingly.

Venturers Search and Rescue

The League of Venturers Search and Rescue were established in England in August 1961.
The League of Venturers Search and Rescue were established to show that teenagers, if given the training, equipment, opportunity and trust could provide a valuable service to the adult community.
They provide a sea rescue service for the Coastguard and a land rescue service for the Police.
Venturers are manned by volunteers aged 12–21.
The Early Days.
The service was started by Mr Philip Gordon Pierce-Smith who no longer runs the service he started nearly 52 years ago, now renamed UK YOUTH MARINE TRAINING ACADEMY.
Venturers started on limited funds and equipment, patrolling Poole Harbour with a small prototype Deep V soft bottom hulled inflatable developed by David Doderell of SWMF in Poole. It proved to be a fantastic hull until the bottom stretched or the wooden keel snapped. The crews had RAF Lifejackets and anoraks, navigation was done with a AA road map and hand held compass, a far cry from the current standards.
Since then the service has developed, seeing many different rescue boats and hundreds of crew.
Recent years.
The League of Venturers had evolved in recent years thanks largely to a substantial legacy and ongoing support from the public and private persons.
The purchase of two Ocean Dynamics wateret RIBs played a big part in this, however the larger 40 foot cabin RIB had to be sold in late 2005, it was replaced with a Humber Ocean Pro 6.3 that provided a training platform for the Venturers in the waters of the Solent.
What's happening now?
The UK YMTA serves as an exciting and educational facility, teaching volunteer teenagers,in all aspects of the Marine based environment, with a view to not just serving the community but improving employment prospects. Our largest vessel Lepe Rescue1 serves (with a young and well qualified adult crew) as an additional facility to HM Coastguard.
The mostly Sea based training and operations are undertaken from a purpose built Control room next to the Old Coastguard Cottages at Lepe Beach, overlooking the Western Solent and The Beaulieu River. The control room is fully equipped with charts, radio, Direction Finding Equipment and Radar.
The land based events and training run out of our Gangwarily HQ a few miles in land. The premises are also where we store our vehicles and work is undertaken in the workshop at Gangwarily, complete with pit and full set of tools / parts.
They can be called upon by the coastguard to attend incidents, in 2009 the organization attended 90 incidents at sea. - double the amount from previous years and are still assisting Mariners today.
The UK YMTA have recently improved training programmes and Sea based qualifications are around RYA guidelines with our cadets, who practice their skills for at least 6 months of the year training them to the highest standards possible. 
The UK YMTA also helped the OGA celebrate their 50th anniversary this year in Cowes and have had many ex members visiting us and to exchange memories.

Bagley Memorial Fountain

The Bagley Memorial Fountain is a historic fountain in Detroit, Michigan. It has recently been moved from its long-time location in Campus Martius Park to a new location in just down the street in Cadillac Square Park. The fountain was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971. The John N. Bagley House (1889) at 2921 East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit was constructed for Governor Bagley's son, and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
John J. Bagley.
John J. Bagley was the 16th governor of Michigan, serving from 1873 to 1877. Bagley also served as a Detroit Alderman from 1860–61 and as Police Commissioner from 1865-72. He was instrumental in the creation of the Detroit Metropolitan Police Commission and the construction of the first Detroit House of Correction. When Bagley died in 1881, his will contained $5,000 for the construction of a drinking fountain for the people of Detroit, having "water cold and pure as the coldest mountain stream."
Fountain.
In 1885, the Bagley family chose Henry Hobson Richardson to design the fountain. In 1887, the Bagley Memorial Fountain was dedicated at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Fort Street. Richardson constructed the fountain entirely out of pink Bragville granite, modeled after a ciborium located in St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice. The Bagley Memorial Fountain stands 21 feet high with a basin 7 feet across. At the center of the fountain, four lion heads distribute water. In the original design, two of the heads produced "normal" temperature water and the other two produced cold water, chilled by ice packed around the fountain pipes. The inscription on the four sides of the cornice reads: TESTAMENTARY GIFT | FOR THE PEOPLE FROM | JOHN JVDSON BAGLEY | A.D. MDCCCLXXXVII.
Later moves.
In 1926 the fountain was moved from its original home at Woodward and Fort to Campus Martius, because of the increase of automobile traffic. In 2000, the fountain was removed from it site, disassembled, and put into storage. In 2007, the fountain was installed in its current location in Cadillac Square; a new lion fountainhead replaced the original, which was stolen. It is the only remaining work by Richardson in the Detroit area.

<doc id="18660230" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18660230" title="Blockade Strategy Board">
Blockade Strategy Board

The Blockade Strategy Board of the American Civil War, also known variously as the Commission of Conference or as the Du Pont Board, was a group of four men, meeting in the summer of 1861 at the request of the Navy Department, who laid out a preliminary strategy for enforcing the blockade of seceding states that had been proclaimed by President Abraham Lincoln. Although the board reported to the Navy Department, only half of its members were sailors. These were Captain Samuel Francis Du Pont, who acted as chairman, and Commander Charles Henry Davis. The other two were Major John Gross Barnard of the US Army and Alexander Dallas Bache of the US Coast Survey and the Smithsonian Institution. The board considered the entire coast held by the Confederate States of America, and recommended how best to complete the blockade. Their reports for the Atlantic seaboard were used, with modifications, to direct the early course of the naval war. Their analysis of the Gulf Coast was not so successful, largely because the detailed oceanographic knowledge that marked the Atlantic reports was not available for the Gulf.
Origin.
Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, was bombarded on 12 April 1861, thereby initiating the American Civil War. Following the outbreak of hostilities, on 19 April President Lincoln proclaimed a blockade of all ports in the states that had seceded from the Union at that time; later, after Virginia and North Carolina also joined the Confederacy, his proclamation was modified to include their coastlines as well. The blockade, which existed only on paper at this time, became an integral part of the plan to persuade the seceded states to return to the Union that was proposed by General in Chief Winfield Scott. Scott's so-called Anaconda Plan was not formally adopted as an outline strategy to guide the conduct of the war, but the blockade was enforced to the limit of ability of the US Navy as long as the conflict lasted.
At the start, the Navy was woefully inadequate to the task of blockading the 3000 miles (4800 km) of Southern shoreline. It had only 90 ships of all types, and only 42 that were powered by steam. A frenzied program of shipbuilding and conversions of existing merchant vessels increased the number to 671 by the end of the war, but as they came into service, their assignments had to be prioritized. 
The person in Lincoln's cabinet most concerned with rationalizing the blockade was Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase. Treasury's Revenue Cutter Service was the agency most familiar with the nation's ports, and the knowledge of harbor bottoms held by its Coast Survey would be needed by the naval commanders who patrolled their waters. He persuaded Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to set up a commission to study the entire Southern coast, and on 25 June 1861 Welles issued the necessary orders to Captain (later Rear Admiral) Samuel Francis Du Pont. At the same time, he ordered Commander (later Rear Admiral) Charles Henry Davis to the board to serve as secretary, and requested that Army Major (later Major General) John G. Barnard, chief of the Army Corps of Engineers, and Alexander D. Bache, Superintendent of the Coast Survey, lend their services. Other persons gave advice, but all reports issued by the commission were signed only by these four.
The reports.
The board delivered its first report, dealing with a southern anchor for the Atlantic blockade, on 5 July. It continued to issue reports throughout the summer. These have been published as parts of the Official Records. Identified by their dates, they are:
Effect.
The recommendations of the board for the Atlantic blockade were mostly accepted, with modifications, by the Lincoln administration. The capture of Fernandina, proposed as the initial offensive action of the Union Navy, was postponed until after the capture of Hatteras Island and Port Royal. The suggestion that Hatteras Inlet be blocked up was overruled by Flag Officer Silas Stringham and Brig. General Benjamin F. Butler, the men who led the expedition. (The board had anticipated that its recommendations would not be followed to the letter. In their report, they included the statement that "These plans may undergo some modification in the hands of the person to whom their execution shall be intrusted.")
The capture of Port Royal Sound also represented a divergence from the board's original plan. They had stated a preference for an attack on St. Helena Sound, which was nearer to Charleston and also would have been harder for the Rebels to defend. The natural advantages of Port Royal were so great, however, that the administration chose to take it. Perhaps ironically, Captain (by then Flag Officer) Du Pont was selected to lead the naval contingent in the expedition against the harbor.
The Gulf blockade diverged much further from board plans for several reasons. One of the most important is the lack of knowledge of the Gulf coast compared with the Atlantic. The hydrography was so imperfectly known that one of the board's more emphatic recommendations was that a Coast Survey vessel should be attached to each blockading squadron. (This recommendation was accepted. The Coast Survey proved to be quite useful throughout the war.)
Although Ship Island was taken in accord with the report of 9 August, the Navy Department used it as the staging ground for David G. Farragut's assault on and capture of New Orleans. The board had opposed any immediate move up the Mississippi River, not because it would be undesirable, but because they believed that it could not be done with the weapons at hand.
The blockade of the southern extreme of the Texas coast also did not conform to board expectations. The problem there was that the port at Brownsville, at the mouth of the Rio Grande, also served the Mexican community of Matamoros. The international problems associated with the blockade there were exacerbated by the rebellion against the Emperor Maximilian going on in Mexico at the time.
Conclusion.
Although it may appear that the Blockade Strategy Board had only a minimal effect on the war, it nevertheless deserves respect because it was the first effort by the United States to conduct a war by rational principles, rather than simply reacting to events. As the armed forces did not have an Office of Naval Operations or a General Staff at the time, it served as a rudimentary surrogate. As such, it was an important forerunner of the present-day staff system.

<doc id="18660247" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18660247" title="Mutinus caninus">
Mutinus caninus

Mutinus caninus, commonly known as the dog stinkhorn, is a small thin, phallus-shaped woodland fungus, with a dark tip. It is often found growing in small groups on wood debris, or in leaf litter, during summer and autumn in Europe, Asia, and eastern North America. It is not generally considered edible, although there are reports of the immature 'eggs' being consumed.
Taxonomy.
The genus name "Mutinus" was a phallic deity, Mutinus Mutunus, one of the Roman "di indigetes" placated by Roman brides, and "caninus" means "dog-like" in Latin. "Mutinus" is the diminutive of "muto", a Latin word for Penis. It was described initially by William Hudson (1730–1793), a noted British botanist. Its common names in French, "Phallus de Chien", "Satyre des chiens", also hint at its resemblance to a dog penis. It is commonly known as the "dog stinkhorn".
Description.
This small member of the Phallaceae family emerges from an off-white egg-like fruiting body that lies half buried in leaf litter on the woodland floor. White mycelial cords (rhizomorphs), are often visible beneath this 'egg', which is 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) high, and 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) wide. The 'egg' has a tough outer skin (peridium), which covers a gelatinous inner layer, which in turn protects the fully formed, but unexpanded fruiting body. When the ‘egg’ splits open the fungus expands rapidly (usually within a few hours), to its full height of 10–12 cm (4–5 in). It is around 1 cm (0.4 in) thick, and is either yellowish-white, yellow, or pale orange. The split egg is retained as a volva-like sack, at the base. The column is very fragile, pitted, and cylindrical. It has a pointed tip, and is usually curved. The tip is covered in the spore bearing matter (gleba) which is a dark olive-brown paste, and has a smell which is irresistible to insects. (These insects help distribute the spores on their bodies, and in their stomachs.) Beneath the spore mass the tip is dark orange. Although its smell is not as strong as the related common stinkhorn ("Phallus impudicus"), it has been described as smelling like cat faeces.
American mycologist Sanford Myron Zeller described an albino form of the fungus based on collections made in Warrengon, Oregon. This form, named "M. caninus" var. "albus", was first mentioned in the scientific literature by Edward Angus Burt in 1896. It is essentially identical to the regular form except that it is pure white throughout, except for the gleba.
Similar species.
"Mutinus ravenelii" is pinker in coloration, with a red tip. It is a rarer American species, now spreading in Europe. Another North American species "Mutinus elegans" is very similar to "M. ravenelii", and is short and stocky, with a more pointed apex.
Distribution and habitat.
The dog stinkhorn is found occasionally, and is quite common in Europe, Britain, and Eastern North America. The fungus is listed in the red data list of the Ukraine. A collection from the Canary Islands was noted as the southernmost collection for the species in the Northern Hemisphere. It is also been collected in Iran, Turkey, and China, including Hebei, Jilin, and Guangdong. It appears from summer to late autumn, and is usually found in small groups; in leaf litter; on wood debris, or wooded roadsides. It may occur in both deciduous, and coniferous woods. The fruit bodies of the fungus can serve as a food source for developing blow flies ("Phormia regina").
Edibility.
The dog stinkhorn is probably edible at the ‘egg’ stage, but it is not recommended. At least one report from in the eastern United States strongly recommends the 'eggs' peeled and fried as a tasty dish.

Mullahoran GFC

Mullahoran Gaelic Football Club is a Gaelic games club from County Cavan in Ireland. Founded in 1888, it is affiliated to Cavan GAA. The club is also known by a nickname, the Dreadnoughts. Mullahoran GFC is a rural club located in the parish of Mullahoran in south Cavan, approximately 10 miles from Cavan town. All aspects of the GAA from Gaelic football to rounders, hurling and handball are played at the club and numerous county and national honours have been won in the past in all these activities.
Gaelic football.
Mullahoran have appeared in five of the last ten Cavan Senior Football Championship finals. They last played in the Ulster Club Championship in 2006, losing to eventual All-Ireland champions Crossmaglen Rangers in the first round. Mullahoran have the second-best record in the Cavan Championship with 12 wins, the first being in 1935.
Notable players.
Current Mullahoran players on the Cavan senior team include world handball champion Paul Brady, Eddie Reilly and Dermot Sheridan. Famous Mullahoran players of past Cavan teams include Damien O'Reilly, Phil 'The Gunner' Brady, Brian O'Reilly, Val Gannon and former Tánaiste John P. Wilson. Cavan football from the 1930s through to the 1950s relied heavily on Mullahoran and Cornafean players.
Hurling.
The parish also has a separate hurling team known as Mullahoran St Joseph's. The club had been unbeaten in the Cavan Senior Hurling Championship since 1990 until surrendering the title to Ballymachugh in 2011. The club's run of 21 consecutive Championship titles is a record in the GAA. The club also appeared in the Division 3 Ulster Senior Hurling League in 2006, but lost to Bredagh from County Down. Mullahoran's U-14 hurlers also won the All-Ireland Féile in 2003, becoming one of the first Cavan teams to win a national hurling honour.
Rounders.
The Erne Eagles Rounders club has been up and running in the area since 1984/5. The club is one of the most successful clubs in the country and can include the following in their list of honours:
A number of the senior men's and women's team members have been recognised with All-Star awards at national level.
Ladies Gaelic Football.
Mullahoran Ladies Gaelic Football are strongly represented over the years, winning numerous titles from U12 to Seniors.
The U16 ladies are currently the championship and league county champions having beaten Lacken and Templeport in the finals. Mullahoran Ladies also won the inaugural Ladies All-Ireland Club Championship in 1977. The team beat Newtownshandrum of Cork to win the Dolores Tyrrell Memorial Cup.
Féile 2008.
Féile was hosted by Cavan in 2008 and both u-14 boys and girls in Mullahoran hosted teams in their houses for the weekend of Féile. The boys hosted Yorkshire, England, while the girls hosted St Anne's Rathangan, Wexford. Although some of the teams won some games none of them were successful enough to reach the final.

The Spoken Word Project

The Spoken Word is a multi-million dollar project based in the Saltire Centre at Glasgow Caledonian University.
The project is part of the JISC/NSF funded Digital Libraries in the Classroom Programme and aims to provide tools appropriate for the digital classroom by exploiting the educational potential of the interests and activities of the social networking generation.
The project has a unique ‘legal deposit’ agreement with the BBC that allows access to the BBC archives"for educational uses only". Television and radio programmes from the BBC archives and other sources are then made available in a digital form through the website to educational users across the UK, the EU, the USA and beyond. These digitised materials can be put to varying educational uses.
Inception.
The foundations for the project were first laid down in the early 1990s when the eventual Principal Investigator of the project, David Donald, met Professor Jerry Goldman of Northwestern University through what was eventually incarnated as the Internet in the form that we are presently familiar with.

Roman Catholic Diocese of Vijayapuram

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Vijayapuram () is a diocese located in the city of Kottayam in the Ecclesiastical province of Verapoly in India.
History.
The Diocese of Vijayapuram was established on July 14, 1930 from the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Verapoly.
History.
By the apostolic Bull "Ad Christi Nomen", His Holiness Pope Pius XI bifurcated the Archdiocese of Verapoly and erected the Diocese of Vijayapuram on July 14, 1930. The headquarters of the diocese is in Kottayam Municipal Town. As there is an Oriental Catholic Diocese named Kottayam since 1887, the formators decided to name the new diocese Vijayapuram, because it was the name of the Panchayath adjacent to Kottayam town and it was the centre of the Church activities of the Diocese. Vijayapuram is characterized by its multiple specialties. It comprises the entire civil districts of Kottayam, Idukki and partial portions comprises the entire civil districts of Kottayam, Idukki and partial portions of the districts of Alleppey, Ernakulam and Pathanamthitta.
Many factors facilitated the formation of this diocese. The presence of Latin Catholics in this area is due to rapid migration from within and outside the state. The first phase of the migration started in the middle of the 18th century when Latin Catholics from the Diocese of Cochin came to Vaisiambhagom, Nedumudy, Kanjpadam and its vicinities. The second phase began at the first half of the 19th century, when people from different parishes of Quilon reached Maramon, Ranny, Vanavathukkara, Thiruvalla, Changanacherry and Poovam. The third phase started by the second half of the 19th century when the high ranges of the eastern side began to be used for cultivation tea. People from Verapoly, Cochin and from different parts of Tamil Nadu settled down in this area for different jobs. The arrival of Brother Rockey Palackal, OCD, at the end of the 19th century geared upon the fourth phase of the history of the Diocese of Vijayapuram. Brother Rockey, as a zealous father, worked hard in Kottayam, Thellakom, Chengalam and Kumarakom and preached the Good News to the native people, especially among the so-called low castes. He opted to serve the poor, sidelined, marginalized and downtrodden and thus secured the name "Apostle of the Outcastes".
The area Church work of the Archdiocese of Verapoly entrusted to the Carmelites was created to be the Diocese of Vijayapuram. The administration was in the hands of the Carmelites of the Navara Province.

Auckland

The Auckland metropolitan area (, ), in the North Island of New Zealand, is the largest and most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has an urban population of and a metropolitan population of , which respectively constitute and percent of the country's population. Auckland has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. In Māori, Auckland's name is Tāmaki Makaurau and the transliterated version of Auckland is Ākarana.
The Auckland urban area (as defined by Statistics New Zealand) ranges to Waiwera in the north, Kumeu in the northwest, and Runciman in the south. It is not contiguous; the section from Waiwera to Whangaparaoa Peninsula is separate from its nearest neighbouring suburb of Long Bay. Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east, the low Hunua Ranges to the south-east, the Manukau Harbour to the south-west, and the Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. Auckland is the most remote substantially populated city. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemata Harbour on the Pacific Ocean. It is one of the few cities in the world to have two harbours on two separate major bodies of water.
The 2011 Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranked Auckland 3rd place in the world on its list, while the "Economist's" World's most liveable cities index of 2011 ranked Auckland in 9th place.
In 2010, Auckland was classified as a Beta World City in the World Cities Study Group's inventory by Loughborough University.
History.
Early Māori and Europeans.
The isthmus was settled by Māori around 1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land. Many "pā" (fortified villages) were created, mainly on the volcanic peaks. Māori population in the area is estimated at about 20,000 people before the arrival of Europeans. The subsequent introduction of firearms, which began in Northland, upset the balance of power and led to devastating inter-tribal warfare, causing iwi who lacked the new weapons to seek refuge in areas less exposed to coastal raids. As a result, the region had relatively low numbers of Māori when European settlement of New Zealand began. There is, however, nothing to suggest that this was the result of a deliberate European policy. On 27 January 1832, Joseph Brooks Weller, eldest of the Weller brothers of Otago and Sydney bought land including the sites of the modern cities of Auckland and North Shore and part of Rodney District, for "one large cask of powder" from "Cohi Rangatira".
After the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in February 1840, the new Governor of New Zealand, William Hobson, chose the area as his new capital, and named it after George Eden, Earl of Auckland, then Viceroy of India. The land that Auckland was established on was given to the Governor by local Maori iwi Ngāti Whātua, as a sign of goodwill and in the hope that the building of a city would attract commercial and political opportunities for the iwi. Auckland was officially declared New Zealand's capital in 1841, and the transfer of the administration from Russell (now Old Russell) in the Bay of Islands was completed in 1842. However, even in 1840 Port Nicholson (later Wellington) was seen as a better choice for an administrative capital because of its proximity to the South Island and Wellington became the capital in 1865. After losing its status as capital, Auckland remained the principal city of the Auckland Province until the provincial system was abolished in 1876.
Growth up to today.
In response to the ongoing rebellion by Hone Heke in the mid-1840s the government encouraged retired but fit British soldiers and their families to migrate to Auckland to form a defence line around the port settlement as garrison soldiers. Amongst the first settlers were some Catholics and in 1841 they established Auckland's first school of any sort which held its first class on 27 September 1841. By the time the first Fencibles arrived in 1848, the rebels in the north had been defeated, so the outlying defensive towns were constructed to the south stretching in a line from the port village of Onehunga in the West, to Howick in the east. Each of the 4 settlements had about 800 settlers, the men being fully armed in case of emergency but spent nearly all their time breaking in the land and establishing roads. In the early 1860s, Auckland became a base against the Māori King Movement. This, and continued road building towards the south into the Waikato, enabled Pākehā (European New Zealanders) influence to spread from Auckland. Its population grew fairly rapidly, from 1,500 in 1841 to 12,423 by 1864. The growth occurred similarly to other mercantile-dominated cities, mainly around the port and with problems of overcrowding and pollution. Auckland had a far greater population of ex soldiers than other settlements, many of whom were Irish. About 50% of the population was Irish which contrasted heavily with the majority English settlers in Wellington, Christchurch or New Plymouth. Most of the Irish, though not all, were from Protestant Ulster. The majority of settlers in the early period were assisted by receiving a cheap passage to NZ.
Trams and railway lines shaped Auckland's rapid expansion in the early first half of the 20th century, but soon afterward the dominance of the motor vehicle emerged and has not abated since; arterial roads and motorways have become both defining and geographically dividing features of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of associated urban areas like the North Shore (especially after the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge), and Manukau City in the south. According to the 1961 census data, Māori and Pacific Islanders composed 5% of Auckland's population; Asians less than 1%.
A large percentage of Auckland is dominated by a suburban style of building, giving the city a low population density characteristic of most New World cities. However, due to a history of strong population growth and the city's location on a constrained isthmus, Auckland has among the highest population density of any urban area in Australasia.
Geography and climate.
Volcanoes.
Auckland straddles the Auckland volcanic field, which has produced about 50 volcanoes. These take the form of cones, lakes, lagoons, islands and depressions, and several have produced extensive lava flows. Some of the cones have been partly or completely quarried away. The individual volcanoes are all considered extinct, although the volcanic field itself is merely dormant. Auckland has at least 14 large lava tube caves which run from the volcanoes down towards the sea.
Auckland's volcanoes are fuelled entirely by basaltic magma, unlike the explosive subduction-driven volcanism in the central North Island, such as at Mount Ruapehu and Lake Taupo. The most recent and by far the largest volcano, Rangitoto Island, was formed within the last 1000 years, and its eruptions destroyed the Māori settlements on neighbouring Motutapu Island some 700 years ago. Rangitoto's size, its symmetry, its position guarding the entrance to Waitemata Harbour and its visibility from many parts of the Auckland region make it Auckland's most iconic natural feature. Few birds and insects inhabit the island because of the rich acidic soil and the type of flora growing out of the rocky soil.
Harbours, gulf and rivers.
Auckland lies on and around an isthmus, less than two kilometres wide at its narrowest point, between Mangere Inlet and the Tamaki River. There are two harbours in the Auckland urban area surrounding this isthmus: Waitemata Harbour to the north, which opens east to the Hauraki Gulf, and Manukau Harbour to the south, which opens west to the Tasman Sea. The total coastline of Auckland is 3,702 km in length.
Bridges span parts of both harbours, notably the Auckland Harbour Bridge crossing the Waitemata Harbour west of the Auckland Central Business District (CBD). The Mangere Bridge and the Upper Harbour Bridge span the upper reaches of the Manukau and Waitemata Harbours, respectively. In earlier times, portage paths crossed the narrowest sections of the isthmus.
Several islands of the Hauraki Gulf are administered as part of Auckland, though they are not part of the Auckland metropolitan area. Parts of Waiheke Island effectively function as Auckland suburbs, while various smaller islands near Auckland are mostly zoned 'recreational open space' or are nature sanctuaries.
Auckland also has a total length of approximately 21,000 km of rivers and streams, about 8% of these in urban areas.
Climate.
Auckland has a temperate climate, with warm, humid summers and mild, damp winters. Under Köppen's climate classification, the city has an oceanic climate ("Cfb"). It is the warmest main centre of New Zealand and is also one of the sunniest, with an average of 2060 sunshine hours per annum. The average daily maximum temperature is 23.7 °C (74.7 °F) in February and 14.5 °C (58.1 °F) in July. The absolute maximum recorded temperature is , while the absolute minimum is . High levels of rainfall occur almost year-round with an average of 1240 mm per year spread over 137 'rain days'. Snowfall in Auckland is extremely rare; recorded instances include 27 July 1939 and 15 August 2011, although without any accumulation.
The early morning calm on the isthmus during settled weather, before the sea breeze rises, was described as early as 1853: "In all seasons, the beauty of the day is in the early morning. At that time, generally, a solemn stillness holds, and a perfect calm prevails...". Many Aucklanders use this time of day to walk and run in parks.
Auckland occasionally suffers from air pollution due to fine particle emissions. There are also occasional breaches of guideline levels of carbon monoxide. While maritime winds normally disperse the pollution relatively quickly it can sometimes become visible as smog, especially on calm winter days. Precipitation is relatively abundant all year round, but is higher in winter.
People.
Cultures.
Auckland is home to many cultures. The majority of inhabitants claim European – predominantly British and/or Irish – descent, but substantial Māori, Pacific Islander and Asian communities exist as well. Auckland has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world and a higher proportion of people of Asian origin than the rest of New Zealand. Ethnic groups from all corners of the world have a presence in Auckland, making it by far the country's most cosmopolitan city. 40% of Aucklanders are born overseas according to the 2013 census.
Demographics.
At the time of the 2006 Census, Auckland had 32.4% of New Zealand's population. The proportion of Asians and other Non-European immigrants has increased during the last decades due to immigration, and the removal of restrictions directly or indirectly based on race. Immigration to New Zealand is heavily concentrated towards Auckland (partly for job market reasons). This strong focus on Auckland has led the immigration services to award extra points towards immigration visa requirements for people intending to move to other parts of New Zealand.
The following table shows the ethnic profile of Auckland's population, as recorded in the 2001 and 2006 New Zealand Census. The percentages add up to more than 100%, as some people counted themselves as belonging to more than one ethnic group. Figures for 2006 refer to the whole Auckland Region, not just the urban area. The substantial percentage drop of 'Europeans' was mainly caused by the increasing numbers of people from this group choosing to define themselves as 'New Zealanders' – even though this was not one of the groups listed on the census form.
The 2006 Census also provides information about the multilinguality of the region. 867,825 people in the Auckland Region spoke one language only, 274,863 spoke two, and 57,051 three or more.
Religion.
Similar to the rest of the country, over half of Aucklanders profess Christianity, but fewer than 10% regularly attend church and almost 40% profess no religious affiliation (2006 census figures). The main denominations are Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian. Pentecostal and charismatic churches are the fastest growing. A small community of Coptic Orthodox Christians is also present.
Recent immigration from Asia has added to the religious diversity of the city, and about 10% of the population follow such beliefs as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism, although there are no figures on religious attendance. There is also a small, long-established Jewish community.
Lifestyle.
Auckland's lifestyle is influenced by the fact that while it is 70% rural in land area, 90% of Aucklanders live in urban areas – though large parts of these areas have a more suburban character than many cities in Europe and Asia.
Positive aspects of Auckland life are its mild climate, plentiful employment and educational opportunities, as well as numerous leisure facilities. Meanwhile, traffic problems, the lack of good public transport, and increasing housing costs have been cited by many Aucklanders as among the strongest negative factors of living there, together with crime. Nonetheless, Auckland ranks 4th in a survey of the quality of life of 215 major cities of the world (2009 data).
In 2006, Auckland placed 23rd on the UBS list of the world's richest cities.
In 2011, Auckland is ranked by the Mercer consulting firm as 149 of 214 centres for affordability, i.e. making it one of the most affordable cities world-wide to live in, with living expense of $20000 per year., based on the comparative cost of 200 aspects of life including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods.
Leisure.
One of Auckland's nicknames, the "City of Sails", is derived from the popularity of sailing in the region. 135,000 yachts and launches are registered in Auckland, and around 60,500 of the country's 149,900 registered yachtsmen are from Auckland, with about one in three Auckland households owning a boat. The Viaduct Basin, on the western edge of the CBD, hosted two America's Cup challenges (2000 Cup and 2003 Cup). The Waitemata Harbour is home to several notable yacht clubs and marinas, including the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron and Westhaven Marina, the largest of the Southern Hemisphere. The Waitemata Harbour has several popular swimming beaches, including Mission Bay, Kohimarama, Devonport, and Takapuna. The west coast has popular surf spots such as Piha, Muriwai and Bethells Beach. The Whangaparaoa Peninsula, Orewa, Omaha and Pakiri, to the north of the main urban area, are also popular . Many Auckland beaches are patrolled by surf lifesaving clubs, which are part of the Surf Life Saving Northern Region.
Queen Street, Britomart, Ponsonby Road, Karangahape Road, Newmarket and Parnell are popular retail areas, whilst the Otara and Avondale fleamarkets offer an alternative shopping experience on weekend mornings. Most shopping malls are located in the middle- and outer-suburbs, with Sylvia Park and Westfield Albany being the largest.
Arts and culture.
A number of arts events are held in Auckland, including the Auckland Festival, the Auckland Triennial, the New Zealand International Comedy Festival, and the New Zealand International Film Festival. The Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra is the city and region's resident full-time symphony orchestra, performing its own series of concerts and accompanying opera and ballet. Events celebrating the city's cultural diversity include the Pasifika Festival, Polyfest, and the Auckland Lantern Festival, all of which are the largest of their kind in New Zealand. Additionally, Auckland regularly hosts the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and Royal New Zealand Ballet.
Important institutions include the Auckland Art Gallery, Auckland War Memorial Museum, Voyager New Zealand Maritime Museum, National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy, and the Museum of Transport and Technology/. The Auckland Art Gallery is considered the home of the visual arts in New Zealand with a collection of over 15,000 artworks, including prominent New Zealand and Pacific Island artists, as well as international painting, sculpture and print collections ranging in date from 1376 to the present day. In 2009 the Gallery was promised a gift of fifteen works of art by New York art collectors and philanthropists Julian and Josie Robertson – including well-known paintings by Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Paul Gauguin and Piet Mondrian. This is the largest gift ever made to an art museum in Australasia.
Parks and nature.
Auckland Domain is one of the largest parks in the city, close to the Auckland CBD and having a good view of the Hauraki Gulf and Rangitoto Island. Smaller parks close to the city centre are Albert Park, Myers Park, Western Park and Victoria Park.
While most volcanic cones in the Auckland volcanic field have been affected by quarrying, many of the remaining cones are now within parks, and retain a more natural character than the surrounding city. Prehistoric earthworks and historic fortifications are in several of these parks, including Mount Eden, North Head and One Tree Hill (Maungakiekie).
Other parks around the city are in Western Springs, which has a large park bordering the MOTAT museum and the Auckland Zoo. The Auckland Botanic Gardens are further south, in Manurewa.
Ferries provide transport to parks and nature reserves at Devonport, Waiheke Island, Rangitoto Island and Tiritiri Matangi. The Waitakere Ranges Regional Park to the west of Auckland offers beautiful and relatively unspoiled bush territory, as do the Hunua Ranges to the south.
Sport.
Rugby union, rugby league, soccer, cricket and netball are widely played and followed. Auckland has a considerable number of rugby union and cricket grounds, and venues for motorsports, tennis, badminton, netball, swimming, soccer, rugby league, and many other sports.
Annual sporting events include:
Auckland hosted the 1950 British Empire Games and the 14th Commonwealth Games in 1990, and hosted a number of matches (including the semi-finals and the final) of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The 2012 ITU World Triathlon Series Grand Final events were held in the Auckland CBD in October 2012. The 2013 Series kicks off in April in Auckland and will continue there yearly for at least 3 more years.
Economy.
Most major international corporations have an Auckland office, as the city is the economic capital of the nation. The most expensive office space is around lower Queen Street and the Viaduct Basin in the Auckland CBD, where many financial and business services are located, which make up a large percentage of the CBD economy. A large proportion of the technical and trades workforce is based in the industrial zones of South Auckland.
The largest commercial and industrial areas of Greater Auckland are in the southeast of Auckland City and the western parts of Manukau City, mostly bordering the Manukau Harbour and the Tamaki River estuary.
The sub-national GDP of the Auckland region was estimated at US$47.6 billion in 2003, 36% of New Zealand's national GDP, 15% greater than the entire South Island.
Auckland's status as the largest commercial centre of the country reflects in the high median personal income (per working person, per year) which was NZ$44,304 (approx. US$33,000) for the region in 2005, with jobs in the Auckland CBD often earning more. The median personal income (for all persons older than 15 years of age, per year) was NZ$22,300 (2001), behind only North Shore City (also part of the Greater Auckland area) and Wellington. While office workers still account for a large part of Auckland's commuters, large office developments in other parts of the city, for example in Takapuna or Albany, both on the North Shore, are slowly becoming more common, reducing concentration on the Auckland CBD somewhat.
Education.
Primary and secondary.
The Auckland urban area has 340 primary schools, 80 secondary schools, and 29 composite (primary/secondary combined) schools as of February 2012, catering for nearly quarter of a million students. The majority are state schools, but 63 schools are state-integrated and 39 are private.
The city is home to some of the largest schools in New Zealand, including Rangitoto College in the East Coast Bays area, the largest school in New Zealand with just over 3000 students.
Tertiary.
Auckland has a number of important educational institutions, including some of the largest universities in the country. Auckland is a major centre of overseas language education, with large numbers of foreign students (particularly East Asians) coming to the city for several months or years to learn English or study at universities – although numbers New Zealand-wide have dropped substantially since peaking in 2003. As of 2007, there are around 50 New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) certified schools and institutes teaching English in the Auckland area.
Amongst the more important tertiary educational institutes are the University of Auckland, Auckland University of Technology, Massey University, Manukau Institute of Technology and Unitec New Zealand.
Housing.
Housing varies considerably between some suburbs having state owned housing in the lower income neighbourhoods, to palatial waterfront estates, especially on the Waitemata. Traditionally, the most common residence of Aucklanders was a bungalow on a 'quarter acre' (1,000 m²). However, subdividing such properties with 'infill housing', has long been the norm. Aucklanders' housing preferences resulting from a lack of apartments and poor public transport has resulted in a large urban sprawl and reliance on motor vehicles. This will probably continue, as the vast majority of Aucklanders live in low-density housing, which is expected to remain at up to 70% of the total share even in 2050.
In some areas, the Victorian villas are being increasingly torn down to make way for large mansions with tennis courts and swimming pools. The demolition of the older properties is being combated by the Auckland City Council passing laws that cover heritage suburbs or streets. Auckland has been described as having 'the most extensive range of timbered housing with its classical details and mouldings in the world', many of them Victorian-Edwardian style houses.
Government.
Local.
The Auckland Council is the local council with jurisdiction over the city of Auckland, along with surrounding rural areas, parkland, and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf.
From 1989 to 2010 Auckland was governed by several separate city and district councils. In the late 2000s (decade), New Zealand's central government and parts of Auckland's society felt that this large number of councils, and the lack of strong regional government (with the Auckland Regional Council having only limited powers) were hindering Auckland's progress. A Royal Commission on Auckland Governance was set up in 2007, and in 2009 recommended a unified local governance structure for Auckland, amalgamating the councils. Government subsequently announced that a "super city" would be set up with a single mayor by the time of New Zealand's local body elections in 2010.
Many aspects of the reorganisation were or are still controversial, from matters such as the form of representation for Maori, the inclusion or exclusion of rural council areas in the city, to the role of council-controlled organisations that are intended to place much of the day to day business of council services at arms length from the elected Council.
In October 2010, Manukau City mayor Len Brown was elected the mayor of the amalgamated Auckland Council.
National.
Between 1842 and 1865, Auckland was the capital city of New Zealand. Parliament met in what is now Old Government House on the University of Auckland's City campus. The capital was moved to the more centrally located Wellington in 1865.
Auckland, because of its large population, is covered by 21 general electorates and three Maori electorates, each returning one member to the New Zealand House of Representatives. In addition, there are a varying number of Auckland-based List MPs, who are elected via party lists. As of 2012, there are twelve list MPs in the House who contested Auckland-based electorates at the .
Other.
The administrative offices of the Government of the Pitcairn Islands is situated in Auckland.
Transport.
Travel modes.
Private vehicles are the main form of transportation within Auckland, with around 7% of journeys in the Auckland region being undertaken by bus (2006 data), and 2% undertaken by train and ferry. Usage is however heavily skewed towards travel to and from the Central Business District, where more than half of trips are undertaken by public transport. Auckland still ranks quite low in this regard, having only 46 public transport trips per capita per year, while Wellington has almost twice this number at 91, and Sydney has 114 trips. This strong roading focus results in substantial traffic congestion during peak times.
Bus services in Auckland are mostly radial, with few ring-routes, due to Auckland being on an isthmus. Late-night services (i.e. past midnight) are limited, even on weekends.
Regular trains operating along four lines travel between the CBD and the west, south and south-east of Auckland, with longer-distance options scarce. In 2007 approximately NZ$5.3 billion worth of large-scale projects were underway or planned (and budgeted for) in the Auckland area to improve rail and public transport patronage over the next decade, 31% of the transport budget. However, policy changes in early 2009 by the incoming National government have meant a shift in emphasis to more highway construction, and have removed the provision of a regional fuel tax that was to pay for ARTA's public transport upgrades. While the government has promised to fund the rail electrification, the process and associated tenders were delayed by approximately one year, and some rail station upgrades and the funding of the integrated ticketing upgrade were in doubt. The lack of future funding also forced ARTA to hand over the Auckland region's rail stations to government control. Electrification is now underway however, with electric trains scheduled to be running in the next 18 months.
Auckland's ports are the second largest of the country, behind the Port of Tauranga, and a large part of both inbound and outbound New Zealand commerce travels through them, mostly via the facilities northeast of Auckland CBD. Freight usually arrives at or is distributed from the port via road, though the port facilities also have rail access. Auckland is a major cruise ship stopover point, with the ships usually tying up at Princes Wharf. Auckland CBD is connected to coastal suburbs, to the North Shore and to outlying islands by ferry.
Auckland has various small regional airports and Auckland Airport, the busiest of the country. Auckland Airport, New Zealand's largest, is in the southern suburb of Mangere on the shores of the Manukau Harbour. There are frequent services to Australia, and to other New Zealand destinations. There are also direct connections to many locations in the South Pacific, to the United States, Asia and to Santiago in South America.
Research at Griffith University has indicated that in the last 50 years, Auckland has engaged in some of the most pro-automobile transport policies anywhere in the world. With public transport declining heavily during the second half of the 20th century (a trend mirrored in most Western countries such as the US), and increased spending on roads and cars, New Zealand (and specifically Auckland) now has the second-highest vehicle ownership rate in the world, with around 578 vehicles per 1000 people. Auckland has also been called a very pedestrian- and cyclist-unfriendly city, though some efforts are being made to change this. At the same, high-profile gaps in the network, such as the inability for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the Waitemata Harbour, will probably remain for the foreseeable future, with councils generally not considering the costs involved as sensible expense.
Infrastructure.
The State Highway network connects the cities in the Auckland urban area through the Northern, Southern, Northwestern and Southwestern Motorways.
The Auckland Harbour Bridge (Northern Motorway) is the main connection to the North Shore, and also a major traffic bottleneck. The Harbour Bridge does not provide access for rail, pedestrians or cyclists, which has repeatedly (most recently in 2008) led to campaigns for and investigations into retrofitting the structure.
The Central Motorway Junction, also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland (State Highway 1 and State Highway 16).
Two of the longest arterial roads within Greater Auckland are Great North Road and Great South Road – the main connections in those directions before the construction of the State Highway network.
Auckland has four main railway lines, serving the general western, southern, south western and central eastern directions from the Britomart Transport Centre in downtown Auckland. It is the terminal station for all lines, and connects them to ferry and bus services.
Electricity.
Auckland is New Zealand's largest electricity consumer, and uses around 20% of the country's total electricity each year. Vector, which operates the majority of Auckland's local distribution system, measured maximum demand to be 1722 MW in 2011, with 8679 GWh delivered.
There are two major electricity generation stations located within the city, both of which are natural gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine stations. Otahuhu B is owned by Contact Energy and generates 380 MW, while Southdown is owned by Mighty River Power and generates 175 MW.
Since there is not enough generation in Auckland to meet the demand, and there is very little generation north of Auckland, most of the electricity for Auckland and Northland must be transmitted from power stations in the south, mainly from Huntly Power Station and the Waikato River hydroelectric stations.
Transpower owns the national grid and is responsible for the high voltage transmission lines into and across Auckland. As at March 2012, the existing grid has six major 220 kV transmission circuits bringing power into Auckland from the south. These six circuits are carried on four main transmission lines, and all terminate at Otahuhu substation. A low capacity 110 kV transmission line also brings power from the south, but makes only a minor contribution to meeting the demand.
The sub-transmission and distribution network in the Auckland region is mostly owned by Vector. The network south of central Papakura is owned by Counties Power.
There have been several notable power outages in Auckland. The five-week long 1998 Auckland power crisis blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure occurred on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network. The 2006 Auckland Blackout interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire shackle at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and short-circuited the lines supplying the inner city. In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, as well as all of Northland, experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came in contact with the only major line supplying the region.
These outages have shown that the transmission and distribution systems are in need of enhancement. Transpower is currently spending $1.25 billion upgrading transmission into Auckland and Northland, to relieve supply constraints and to improve security. The largest single project is the Whakamaru to Brownhill Road transmission line being built from the south Waikato to a new switching station at Brownhill Road near Whitford in south-east Auckland. From Brownhill Road, underground cables operating at 220 kV connect the new line to Pakuranga substation. This project significantly increases transmission capacity into the Auckland region, and provides diversity by reducing the dependence on Otahuhu substation. A further 37 km of 220 kV underground cable is being installed as part of the North Auckland and Northland grid upgrade project from Pakuranga to Penrose, and then via the CBD across the Waitemata Harbour to Albany. This project creates an alternative transmission route to the north of Auckland.
Future growth.
Auckland is expecting substantial population growth via immigration and natural population increases (which contribute to growth at about one-third and two-thirds, respectively), and is set to grow to an estimated 1.9 million inhabitants by 2031. This substantial increase in population will have a major impact on transport, housing and other infrastructure that is in many cases already considered under pressure. It is also feared by some organisations, such as the Auckland Regional Council, that urban sprawl will result from the growth and, as a result, that it is necessary to address this proactively in planning policy.
A 'Regional Growth Strategy' has been adopted that sees limits on further subdivision and intensification of existing use as its main sustainability measures. This policy is contentious, as it naturally limits the uses of private land, especially the subdivision of urban fringe properties, by setting 'Metropolitan Urban Limits' in planning documents like the District Plan.
According to the 2006 Census projections, the medium-variant scenario shows that the population is projected to continue growing, to reach 1.93 million by 2031. The high-variant scenario shows the region's population growing to over two million by 2031.

KMQ viewer

KMQ viewer are glasses for viewing a stereoscopic over/under format. KMQ was invented in the 1980s by a team of three physicists. KMQ stands for the inventors' initials: Koschnitzke, Mehnert, Quick. A recent usage of this technique is the openKMQ project.
Principle.
An image pair is placed one above one another. The prismatic viewer tilts the right eyesight slightly up and the left eyesight slightly down.
Stereoscopic viewing is achieved at a matching distance to the glasses. When placing the right view on top of a (letter/A4 size) paper and the left view below, viewing from arm length distance (ca. 50 cm) creates a stereo experience. Bigger over/under stereo image pairs on either paper or a monitor can be viewed from a proportional greater distance.

Robert Nathan (intelligence officer)

Sir Robert Nathan, KCSI, CIE (1868–1921) was a British intelligence official notable for his works against the Indian revolutionaries in Bengal, Britain and North America.
Early career in India.
Nathan was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, before joining the Indian Civil Service in 1888. He was appointed secretary of the Indian Universities Commission in 1902, and Private Secretary to the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, in 1905. In 1907 Nathan was made Chief Secretary to the Government of Eastern Bengal and Assam, and Commissioner of Dhaka Police. In 1908, Nathan, then the Police Commissioner of Dhaka, was responsible along with the district collector H.L. Salkeld for uncovering the revolutionary organisation of the "Anushilan Samiti", and for instituting the measures to suppress the organisation.
Return to Britain.
Nathan was appointed Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1914, and the same year returned from India on account of ill-health. He began his work for British intelligence against Indian revolutionaries in October 1914. After retiring from the ICS in 1915, Nathan joined the MI5's section dealing with the Indian seditionist movement in Europe, called MI5(g), that was formed at the time headed by Vernon Kell. Nathan's fellow officer at the time was another ex-Indian police official, H.L. Stephenson. He headed at the time the political branch of the Secret service, and along with Basil Thomson who headed the Special Branch of the Scotland Yard, Nathan was closely involved in the interrogation of Indians who worked along with the Germans during the war. 
Nathan's efforts, along with those of John Wallinger's Indian Political Intelligence Office (with whom Nathan worked closely), were key in the British counter-espionage work. Nathan identified plans by Ghadar Party and the Berlin Committee to assassinate Lord Kitchener in 1915 through an associate of Har Dayal, Gobind Behari Lal. He was also responsible at this time, along with Basil Thomson, to turn Harish Chandra (who was associated with the Berlin committee) into a double agent. Nathan was also responsible for the plans made by British intelligence in late 1915 to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhyaya through agent Donald Gullick.
Work in North America.
Later, on instructions from British secret service, Robert Nathan transferred to the Pacific coast of North America where the Ghadar Party worked closely with the German consulate at San Francisco to obtain arms and men for what came to be known as the Ghadar Conspiracy. Nathan successfully brought the Ghadarites and staff at the German consulate to trial following the "Annie Larsen" arms plot. He organised the Hindu-German conspiracy trial, which at the time was the longest in American legal history. He was responsible for the arrest of Chandrakanta Chakraverty and his subsequent interrogation, along with that Ernst Sekunna. Through March 1917, Nathan worked closely with William Wiseman, and negotiated with the US State Department the details of the case against the Indian conspirators. He strongly supported granting a guarantee to the United States not to be held responsible for violation of neutrality.
Later life.
Nathan returned to Britain at the end of World War I where he died in 1921.

Y-Mag

Established in the late 1990s of South Africa, out of a joint partnership between Studentwise, publishers of white youth targeted "SL Magazine" and black youth targeted Johannesburg radio station YFM, "Y Magazine" was conceived as the new voice of the South Africa's recently liberated black urban youth.
Published under the pay-off "Y - because I want to know", it aimed to tap into the market that made YFM the biggest regional station at the time. This was what was referred to as the "Y Generation", a "freedom's children" that got to celebrate the freedom of an apartheid-free South Africa. As poet Lebo Mashile explained:
"if we were 20 or 30 in the 1970s and 1980s we would have been using everything we had to fight Apartheid... but now we have the freedom and space to do what we want with our talent and we have the ability to really manifest our dreams..." 
Under founder editors S'busiso 'The General' Nxumalo and Itumeleng Mahabane, Y quickly came to encapsulate this spirit of freedom of expression. Like YFM, its emphasis was on urban street culture with a strong focus on the sounds of post-apartheid black South Africa especially Kwaito. Written in spoken English and drops of Scamto, it was filled with diverse youth interests without ever narrowing them down to just entertainment. From the relationship between kwaito's apolitical, "hedonistic and flighty preoccupations", to President Thabo Mbeki's macroeconomic ideology, and to the politics of fashion and the aesthetic of struggle, this publication is very well rounded.
This radical challenge to the binary opposition of political/apolitical placed "Y" a step or two ahead of other mainstream magazines, intended for both black and white audiences. This also meant that corporate advertisers remained at arm's length. Inevitably the magazine gave over to market pressures and changes at the radio station. Both Nxumalo and Mahabane stepped down as editors. Since then Y has continued under no less than eight different editors but it has never recaptured the idealism or attitude of those first few issues.

Adiele Afigbo

Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo (22 November 1937 – 9 March 2009) was a Nigerian historian known for the history and historiography of Africa, more particularly Igbo history and the history of Southeastern Nigeria. Themes emphasized include pre-colonial and colonial history, inter-group relations, the Aro and the slave trade, the art and science of history in Africa, and nation-building.
Afigbo took up his career as a historian in the 1950s with the celebrated Ibadan School of History, which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He become a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to demonstrating the need for African history and historiography as specific genres of the world history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching and scholarly work, Afigbo produced works that established reconstructionist history, of African historical methodologies, and links between history and statecraft. He gave rein to eclecticism of sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth, oral sources, from archaeology, linguistics, material artifacts and written sources. In the last analysis he defined a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it.
Early life and education.
Afigbo was born at Ihube, Okigwe, in present day Imo State. His formal education began in 1944 at Methodist Central School, Ihube where he came under the influence of remarkably dedicated teachers, the most outstanding of whom was Mr. Oji Iheukumere, the head teacher, a native of Uzuakoli, in today's Abia State who was a noted church musician and disciplinarian. At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers encourage him to go to secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State. with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Foremost among those were Mazi F,C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and culture and the founder of the Society for The Promotion of Igbo Language and Culture, C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and E. C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to study history at University College, Ibadan (then affiliated with University of London), with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria. There again, he met scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence – J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and K.O. Dike. There were also his colleagues – Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the “made in Nigeria PhD” at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarships awarded by the university to the best graduating students. Adiele Afigbo had not only graduated top of his class, but also was the first among his colleagues to complete his Ph.D. With this, he became the first person ever to receive a doctoral degree from a Nigerian university.
Early career.
On obtaining the Ph.D., Afigbo was appointed a lecturer in history, a position he held for two years before fleeing to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in the wake of the Nigerian civil war. During the duration of hostilities, he served in the Directorate for Propaganda of the Ministry of Information, Republic of Biafra. He resumed his interrupted academic duties after the war, and rose on the academic ladder – from Lecturer to Professor in 1972, thus reaching the top of his profession after only five years. A year after attaining to professorship, he was appointed the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology. The year after, he became also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. On more than one occasion he held the Directorship of the Leo Hansbury Institute of African Studies. He held the following public appointments among others – pioneer Director of Research at the National Institute for policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos; Commissioner first for Education and then for Local Government in the Government of Imo State; Chairman of the Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo in Imo State and Sole Administrator of the Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri. He has also was awareded an Honorary Member of the Historical Association of Great Britain, Fellow of the Historical Society of Nigeria, the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the Fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. His traditional chieftaincy titles include Ogbute-Okewe-Ibe, Ogbuzuo, and Olaudah.
Work as historian.
Afigbo was a historian of Africa, of Nigeria, of Southeastern Nigeria, and finally a historian of the Igbo. He was a political historian, an economic and social historian, and of historiography. "Myth, History and Society," one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the methods of doing history in Africa, on the sources of history in Africa, on the place and purpose of history in Africa and other related issues. In many publications he sought to use the particular to illuminate the universal, and the universal to illuminate the particular. Thus, for instance, he used a detailed study of the textile process in Southern Nigeria to throw much helpful light on the socio-cultural dynamics of the societies of the region. In a similar manner he used the rise and expansion of the pre-colonial great states such as Benin to show that the so-called segmentary societies as well as the so-called mini-states of pre-colonial Africa are, among other things, fossilized reminders of the conditions from which the great states arose.
Afigbo broke away from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasizing in his works basic reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right.
Death.
Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo died in Enugu, Nigeria in the early hours of Monday, March 9, 2009 after a brief illness.

Cis-Neptunian object

A cis-Neptunian object is, literally, any astronomical body found within the orbit of Neptune. However, the term is typically used for those distant minor planets other than trans-Neptunian objects: that is, all sub-planetary bodies orbiting the Sun at or within the distance of Neptune, but outside the orbit of Jupiter. This includes the icy minor planets known as centaurs and the Neptune trojans. 
Centaurs orbit the Sun between Jupiter and Neptune, often crossing the orbits of the large gas giant planets. There is an emerging sense that the centaurs may simply be objects similar to scattered disc objects that were knocked inwards from the Kuiper belt rather than outwards, making them cis-Neptunian rather than trans-Neptunian scattered-disc objects.
Neptune trojans, named by analogy to the Trojan asteroids of Jupiter, are a stable reservoir of small bodies sharing Neptune's orbit. As of August 2012, all known Neptune trojans except two lie in an elongated region around the Lagrangian point 60° ahead of Neptune.

Todd Kessler

Todd Kessler is an award winning American film and television writer, producer and director. Among his credits are show runner and co-creator of Nickelodeon's preschool series "Blue's Clues" and director and producer of the feature film "Keith."
Career.
According to author Malcolm Gladwell, who wrote about "Blue's Clues" in his book "The Tipping Point", Kessler worked for Sesame Workshop's "Sesame Street", but found traditional children's television too static and not visual enough. In 1993-94, Kessler, who was then a freelance producer for Nickelodeon, was assigned to work with Peter Schreck on his seminal interactive television experiments in the network’s Orlando studio, developing concepts which were later incorporated into Blue’s Clues. Kessler was the first creator involved with the show. Angela Santomero and Traci Paige Johnson were brought later on to complete the Blue's Clues team. "Blue's Clues", according to "Variety Magazine", was "at the forefront of a revolution in kids TV" and was crucial to the growth of Nickelodeon. The innovative and interactive format it created changed children's programming, including its most important influence "Sesame Street", which changed its format in 2002 to be more interactive.
Kessler left Nickelodeon and "Blue's Clues" in 2000 after 75 episodes with Blue's Clue's original star, Steve Burns, but was credited as an executive producer throughout the show's run, as well as for all the show's spin-offs.
In 2008, Kessler acquired the teen romantic drama "Keith", a movie adapted from a short story written by Ron Carlson. The film, which starred Jesse McCartney and Elisabeth Harnois, was Kessler's directorial debut. Kessler also produced and co-wrote (with David Zabel) the film, which "concerns a 17-year-old who thinks she's got it all figured out until she falls for a guy who has nothing to lose".
Awards and nominations.
As producer for "Blue's Clues", Kessler received a Peabody Award, two Television Critics Association Awards in 1997-1998 and 1998–1999, several Parents' Choice Awards, and a New York Film Festival CINE Golden Eagle in 1996. He has also been nominated for six Emmys.
"Keith" won first place in the teenage sections of five international film festivals: Italy's Giffoni Film Festival (in the 15–19 year old division); the Toronto International Film Festival for Children and Youth (their Students Choice Award, decided on by high school students); Sweden's BUFF International Film Festival for Youth and Children; Germany's SCHLINGEL International Film Festival; and Quebec's Carrousel international du film de Rimouski.

1719 Establishment

The 1719 Establishment was the first formal 'Establishment' (mandatory requirements to govern the construction of warships for the Royal Navy) laid down to govern the construction of all ships built or rebuilt down to those of 20 carriage guns, whether in the Royal Dockyards or by commercial contractors. It did not apply to ships and other vessels with fewer than 20 carriage guns (which were unrated vessels). It superseded the previous 1706 Establishment, which had only specified the major dimensions of ships of 40 guns and above (and had specifically excluded the 100-gun first rates). 
The new 1719 Establishment was applied to all new ships from first rates down to sixth rates inclusive (i.e. all ships of 20 or more guns) as well as to rebuilds of existing ships. In fact, for the first 20 years from 1719, all ships were technically rebuilds of existing ships, as the Admiralty were constrained not to build "new" (i.e. additional) ships. During this period, a rebuild could amount to anything from stripping off planking to facilitate replacement of rotten timbers and adjustments to suit the required dimensions, or complete dismantlement and construction of what was, for all intents and purposes, a completely new ship making but the scantiest use of timber from the old ship. 
More important was that the new Establishment in 1719 was not simply limited to specifying the overall dimensions of each type of warship, but now set out in great detail other factors used in constructing the ship, down to the thickness of timbers ("scantlings") used in construction and planking.
The Establishment adopted in 1719 was subject to substantial revisions in both 1733 and 1741, although on neither occasion was the 1719 Establishment replaced. A new Establishment was finally adopted in 1745. 
Before the 1745 centralised all design work in the office of the Surveyor of the Navy, the design of every vessel was the responsibility of the Master Shipwright in the dockyard in which that vessel was built; thus ships built to one Establishment has to conform to the dimensions and other measurements specified by that Establishment, but were to varying designs and therefore did not constitute a "class" in the modern use of the term. The exception to this was when ships were built under contract by commercial shipbuilders, for which a common design was prepared by the Surveyor and copies sent to the shipbuilder for execution; this only applied to some of the two-decker ships and smaller vessels (all three-deckers were built or rebuilt in the Royal Dockyards), and was almost exclusively a wartime occurrence.
Background.
When the 1706 Establishment had been introduced, British naval architecture had entered a period of highly conservative stagnation. The Establishments were intended to create standardisation throughout the fleet, in part to reduce the cost of maintaining Britain's large navy. The side effect was to almost completely eliminate any design innovation until the abolition of the Establishments in the early 1750s.
When King George I ascended the throne in 1714, thus beginning the Hanoverian dynasty in Great Britain, the main institutions of the Royal Navy — the Board of Admiralty and the Navy Board — underwent the typical reorganisations associated with a change of régime. While the Admiralty became a much more political body, the Navy Board became populated by men who had learnt their trade during the formative years of the Establishment system. A very significant factor in the formation of the 1719 Establishment and its subsequent longevity is that the period of 1714—1739 was the most peaceful of the 18th Century.
A further contributory factor was the introduction of a new Establishment of Guns in 1716. Previously, gun establishments had catered for each ship, as there were often differences between ships of the same nominal size that would affect the armament they could carry. The 1716 gun establishment was intended to overturn that situation, so that all ships of a particular type (for example, 70 gun ships) would carry the same armament. The Navy Board highlighted the fact that there were still several ships in service that were physically incapable of carrying the prescribed armament, either due to the number and disposition of gunports, or to sturdiness of build. Essentially, however, the Navy Board resolved to undertake the task of having all ships rebuilt to common designs to facilitate the new gun establishment.
1719 arrangements.
The new Establishment of dimensions, finalised in December 1719, was significantly more detailed than its predecessor. The 1706 Establishment had sought to constrain only the basic dimensions (gundeck length, keel length, breadth, and depth in the hold), whereas the 1719 Establishment detailed everything from the keel length to the thickness of planks on each deck. The new Establishment was also expanded in scope to include first rates, the dimensions for which were to be based upon . In the other direction the new Establishment expanded down to include the sixth rates and the smaller (30-gun) fifth rates, so that all ships with 20 guns or more were covered. The dimensions for other ship types were adjusted according to experience with ships built to the 1706 Establishment.
1733 proposals and revisions.
Over time, as British shipbuilding remained stagnant, Britain's foreign maritime rivals, most notably France, continued developing their own ships so that eventually the Navy Board was forced to take note. British ships by comparison with their foreign counterparts were usually significantly smaller — a practice that had come about through a combination of various factors differentiating the role of the Royal Navy from that of the continental navies, but a major factor was the need for a sizeable fleet, and the associated requirement to keep costs as low as practicable. However, by 1729 concerns were being expressed that the ships being built to the 1719 Establishment may be too small, and so a new ship, , and which was due for rebuilding, were built with slightly altered dimensions.
In 1732 the Admiralty decided to ask the Master Shipwrights in each of the Royal dockyards to report to them on how best they thought the ships could be improved. The responses, when they finally arrived, were conservative, offering only minor adjustments to certain dimensions. There was little agreement between the changes proposed, and no further progress was made until May 1733 when Sir Jacob Ackworth of the Navy Board — the Surveyor of the Navy at the time — proposed to the Admiralty some changes to the dimensions of the 50-gun and 60-gun ships, most notably an increase in breadth. The Admiralty accepted these proposals, and the ones that followed in later months for the other types, and these new dimensions became the effective new Establishment, though they never technically superseded the 1719 dimensions; there was no 1733 Establishment. Indications are that the Admiralty desired more far-reaching reforms that what was actually implemented, but due in part to the absence of anyone with practical shipbuilding knowledge on the Board, the Board of Admiralty lacked the ability to realise them.
1741 proposals and revisions.
The true state of British ship design became apparent with the start of the War of Jenkins' Ear. The capture of the Spanish 70-gun ship "Princessa" in April 1740 by three British 70-gun ships (, and ) took six hours of fighting despite one of "Princessa's" topmasts being missing. Her greater size (much closer to that of a British 90-gun ship than a 70) gave her stability that the British ships lacked, and her build quality allowed her to withstand the pounding from the three British ships for a long time. By way of response to the now apparent individual inferiority of British ships over their opponents, a previously abandoned update to the gun establishment was called upon to increase the firepower of the ships. With heavier guns came the need for larger ships to carry them, and so Sir Jacob made a new set of proposals for increased dimensions—slightly less conservative this time around. Additionally, the new gun establishment made some changes to the types of ships that would be on the navy list in future. The 70-gun ships would become 64-gunners, albeit with heavier guns as compensation, and the 60-gun ships were to become 58-gun ships, again with heavier guns. No first rates were built to the dimensions of the 1741 proposals, but one ship of 74 guns and two of 66 were constructed.
An additional side effect of the war was the collapse of the system of rebuilding. Until the outbreak of the war, it had been the practice to rebuild ships periodically , to maintain the size of the fleet without alarming parliament with requests for new ships. In reality, many of these rebuilds amounted to just that, with little or no timber from the original ship surviving into her rebuilt form. In some cases, ships would be dismantled years before they actually underwent the rebuilding process, but remained on the active list for the entire time. Rebuilding a ship was a lengthy process, more time consuming and more expensive than building a completely new one. The pressures of the war meant that for drydocks to be taken up for long periods of time whilst a ship was surveyed to determine what timber was reusable in the new ship, and what could find a use elsewhere in the dockyard, disassembled and then rebuilt was counter-productive. Ships intended to be sent to the West Indies for service in the war required the use of drydocks to have their hulls appropriately sheathed to combat such problems as shipworm, and other uses of the drydocks for servicing the fleet meant that rebuilds were given a low priority. It was at this time that the British practise of converting old ships to hulks for expanded storage space in harbours began, as instead of wasting effort and dockyard space on breaking up an old vessel that was still perfectly capable of floating, they were converted to serve the dockyards in this new capacity. Few rebuilds were started after 1739, and none at all were begun after 1742, although any that had been started were allowed to complete.
Individual ship types.
A different set of Establishment dimensions was defined for each size of ship, other than the smallest (i.e. the unrated) vessels.
First rates of 100 guns.
The 1719 Establishment for first rates took as its model the highly successful "Royal Sovereign" as rebuilt in 1704 (the subsequent "Royal William" and "Britannia" rebuildings had been to the same design dimensions and set of scantlings when they were launched in 1719). Thus all three of these rebuildings should be taken as being "to the 1719 Establishment" even though they actually predated that standard.
While no other first rates were built or rebuilt during the years between 1719 and 1733, the "Royal Sovereign" underwent a further rebuilding between 1723 and 1729.
The 1733 revision made no changes to the tonnage, length or breadth of the first rate, and only increased the depth in hold by 6 inches. The 1741 revision substantively increased the dimensions to:
Only one first rate was built to the 1733 dimensions. The "Victory" was nominally a rebuilding of its predecessor of 1695, but this was strictly a legal fiction, as the old ship had been completely taken to pieces in 1721, and the new ship was not commenced until 1733. Following this ship, no first rate at all was built to the 1741 dimensions.
Second rates of 90 guns.
The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships from the 1706 Establishment dimensions to those shown in the table to the right. Five Second Rates were rebuilt from existing ships to this Establishment specification - the "Prince George" in 1719–1723, the "Union" in 1718–1726, the "Namur" in 1723–1729, the "Neptune" in 1725–1730, and the "Marlborough" in 1725–1732. Two more were ordered to be rebuilt to this Establishment, but were actually completed to the revised 1733 dimensions.
The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows:
Two second rates were rebuilt to the 1733 dimensions, although initially ordered to the original 1719 Establishment. The "Duke" was rebuilt in 1734–1739 and the "Saint George" in 1739–1740. Again, two more were ordered to be rebuilt to these dimensions, but were actually completed to the revised 1741 dimensions.
The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to:
Two second rates were rebuilt to the 1741 dimensions, although initially ordered to the 1733 figures. The "Ramillies" was rebuilt in 1743–1749 and the "Prince" in 1743–1750.
Third rates of 80 guns.
The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships (the smallest class of three-decker warships) as shown in the table to the right. Seven 80-gun ships were rebuilt to this specification before 1733 - the "Lancaster" in 1719–1722, "Norfolk" in 1718–1728, "Cornwall" in 1723–1726, "Princess Caroline" in 1724–1731, "Humber" in 1723–1726, "Somerset" in 1722(?)-1731 and "Russell" in 1729–1735. An eighth ship - the "Cumberland" - was completed to the 1733 dimensions. The "Humber" was renamed "Princess Amelia" in 1727 and was cut down a deck into a 66-gun ship in 1747–1748.
The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows:
Two 80-gun ships were rebuilt to these dimensions - the "Boyne" in 1736–1739 and "Cumberland" in 1734–1739. The "Cumberland" was cut down a deck into a 66-gun ship in 1747–1748.
The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to:
One ship ("Culloden") was built to the 1741 dimensions for 80-gun ships, but during construction was cut down a deck and completed in 1747 as a 74-gun two-decker ship with the following armament:
Two ships ("Devonshire" and "Lancaster") were built to the 1741 dimensions for 80-gun ships, but during construction were each cut down a deck and completed as 66-gun two-decker ships, each with the following armament:
Third rates of 70 (later 64) guns.
The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships as shown in the table to the right. Eight 70-gun ships were rebuilt in 1717–1730 to these specifications - the "Edinburgh", "Northumberland", "Captain", "Stirling Castle", "Lenox", "Kent", "Grafton" and "Ipswich" - while four more were newbuilt, all at Deptford Dockyard - "Burford", "Berwick", "Buckingham", "Prince of Orange" (the last originally to have been named "Bredah").
The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows:
Another twelve 70-gun ships were built or rebuilt to the 1733 dimensions - the "Elizabeth", "Suffolk", "Essex", "Prince Frederick", "Nassau", "Bedford", "Royal Oak", "Revenge", "Stirling Castle", "Captain", "Monmouth" and "Berwick". 
The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to:
The 1743 Establishment of Guns altered these ships from 70-gun to 64-gun, but with more powerful ordnance as set out in the table.
Fourth rates of 60 (later 58) guns.
The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships as shown in the table to the right. Three 60-gun ships were rebuilt to this specification during the early 1720s - the "Plymouth", "Canterbury" and "Windsor" - while the "Dreadnought" underwent a major repair amounting to a rebuild and a fifth ship - the "Sunderland" - was replaced by new construction. In the late 1720s, six new 60-gun ships were rebuilt to replace obsolete 50-gun ships - the "Deptford", "Pembroke", "Tilbury", "Warwick", "Swallow" and "Centurion" (the last-named to a somewhat broader specification), while the 60-gun "Dunkirk" was likewise rebuilt. A slightly lengthened ship - the "Rippon" - was built in 1730–1735.
The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows:
Eleven vessels were initially built to this specification, including six built as replacements for obsolete 50-gun ships. These were the "Weymouth", "Worcester", "Strafford", "Superb", "Jersey", "Augusta", "Dragon", "Lion", "Kingston", "Rupert" and "Princess Mary". After 1739 another four were built - the "Nottingham" and "Exeter" in the Royal Dockyards and the "Medway" and "Dreadnought" by contract.
The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to:
Six ships were ordered to this specification - the "Canterbury", "Sunderland", "Tilbury", "Princess Louisa", "Defiance" and "Eagle". A seventh - "Windsor" - was built to a somewhat enlarged design.
The 1743 Establishment of Guns replaced the 26 9-pounder guns on the upper deck by 24 12-pounder guns, reducing the vessel to a 58-gun ship.
Fourth rates of 50 guns.
The 1716 Establishment of Guns for the smaller fourth rates had replaced the 12-pounder guns on their lower deck by 18-pounders, and the 6-pounders on their upper decks by 9-pounders; at the same time, it removed four of the smaller (6-pounder) guns from the quarterdeck, turning them from 54 to 50 guns. The 1719 Establishment revised the dimensions of these ships as shown in the table to the right.
Fourteen vessels were rebuilt to this specification between 1718 and 1732 - the "Falkland", "Chatham", "Colchester", "Leopard", "Portland", "Lichfield", "Argyll", "Assistance", "Romney", "Oxford", "Greenwich", "Falmouth", "Salisbury" and "Newcastle".
The 1733 revision increased the dimensions as follows:
Eight ships were rebuilt to this specification in the Royal Dockyards - the "Gloucester", "Severn", "Saint Albans", "Woolwich", "Dartmouth", "Guernsey", "Antelope" and "Preston". Subsequently four further vessels were newbuilt by commercial contract - the "Hampshire", "Leopard", "Sutherland" and "Nonsuch.
The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to:
Fourteen vessels were newbuilt by contract to a common design by the Surveyor's Office - the "Harwich", "Colchester", "Falkland", "Chester", "Winchester", "Portland", "Maidstone", "Gloucester", "Norwich", "Ruby", "Advice", "Salisbury". "Lichfield" and a second "Colchester" (after the first was lost in 1744). A fifteenth vessel - "Panther" - was built to a local design at Plymouth Dockyard, and two others were also dockyard-built at Woolwich and Deptford to a lengthened design - the "Bristol" and "Rochester".
Fifth rates of 40 guns.
The 1716 Establishment of Guns for the larger fifth rates had removed the four smaller guns from the quarterdeck and instead added a tenth pair of guns on the lower deck, turning them from 42 to 40 guns. However the lower deck guns were now 12-pounders instead of the former 9-pounders. Thirteen vessels were rebuilt to this specification - the "Hector", "Anglesea", "Diamond", "Mary Galley", "Ludlow Castle", Pearl", Kinsale", "Lark", "Adventure", "Roebuck", "Torrington", "Princess Louisa" and "Southsea Castle".
The 1733 revision made no change to the gundeck length of the 40-gun fifth rate, and actually reduced the keel length by 17 inches. It substantially increased the beam by 26 inches and the depth in hold by 6 inches as follows:
A prototype to this specification - the "Eltham" - was rebuilt in 1734–1736 at Deptford. Thirteen more ships were ordered from commercial contractors from 1739 onwards - the "Dover", "Folkestone", "Faversham", "Lynn", "Gosport", "Sapphire", "Hastings", "Liverpool", "Kinsale", "Adventure", "Diamond", "Launceston" and "Looe".
The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to:
Thirteen ships were built to these specifications, again all by contract - the "Anglesea", "Torrington", "Hector", "Roebuck", "Lark", "Pearl", "Mary Galley", "Ludlow Castle", "Fowey", "Looe", "Poole", "Southsea Castle" and "Chesterfield". Three further ships followed a slightly amended design, with the depth in hold increased by a further 5 inches - the "Prince Edward", another "Anglesea" and "Thetis".
Fifth rates of 30 guns.
The 1719 Establishment made provision for a 30-gun fifth rate with a gundeck length of 114 feet, carrying (under the provisions of the 1716 Establishment of Guns) an armament of eight 9-pounders on the lower deck, twenty 6-pounders on the upper deck, and two 4-pounders on the quarterdeck, but no 30-gun ships were built to this Establishment and this obsolete type was soon to disappear.
Sixth rates of 20 guns.
The 1719 Establishment for sixth rates took as its model the highly successful "Dursley Galley" built in 1719. It revised the dimensions of these ships from the 1706 Establishment dimensions to those shown in the table to the right. Three sixth rates were newbuilt - the "Greyhound" and "Blandford" as replacements in 1720 for lost vessels, and the "Rye" as replacement in 1727 for a discarded ship - and seventeen others were rebuilt from existing ships to this Establishment specification - the "Lyme" and "Shoreham" in 1720, "Scarborough" in 1722, "Lowestoffe" in 1723, "Garland", "Seaford" and "Rose" in 1724, "Deal Castle", "Fox", "Gibraltar", "Bideford", "Seahorse", "Squirrel", "Aldborough", "Flamborough" and "Experiment" in 1727, and "Phoenix" in 1728. Two further 20-gun ships were rebuilt at Deptford to a slightly enlarged specification in 1732 - the "Sheerness" and "Dolphin" - with the beam increased to 30 ft 5in.
The 1733 revision made no change to the gundeck length of the 20-gun sixth rate, and actually reduced the keel length by 9 inches. It substantially increased the beam by 26 inches from the 1719 dimensions and the depth in hold by 3 inches as follows:
Two 20-gun ships were rebuilt at Deptford to the 1733 dimensions - the "Tartar" in 1734 and the "Kennington" in 1736. In 1739–1740 another fourteen were ordered to be newbuilt by commercial contractors to a common design - the "Fox", "Winchelsea", "Lyme", "Rye", "Experiment", "Lively", "Port Mahon", "Scarborough", "Success", "Rose", "Bideford", "Bridgewater", "Seaford" and "Solebay". Two further vessels to a slightly enlarged design - the "Greyhound" and "Blandford" - were also built by contract in 1741.
The 1741 revision further increased the dimensions to:
Fifteen ships were built, all by contract, to a common design and to these specifications - the "Lowestoffe", "Aldborough", "Alderney", "Phoenix", "Sheerness", "Wager", "Shoreham", "Bridgewater", "Glasgow", "Triton", "Mercury", "Surprise", "Siren", "Fox" and "Rye". Again, two further vessels - "Centaur" and "Deal Castle" - were built to a slightly different design (without lower deck gun ports) while still meeting the same 1741 Establishment criteria, while a single vessel - the "Garland" - was built in 1745–1748 at Sheerness Dockyard to a somewhat longer design.

And, a log cabin lodge, with roughly 23 houses, a tennis court, a marina and a big field usable as a football pitch. Children play there. The lake is very popular with fishermen and water sports enthusiasts alike and is suitable for water skiing and jet skiing.
History.
On 25 July 1878, schoolmaster Michael McCabe took his pupils on a boat trip on Lough Sillan. After travelling a short distance the vessel capsized and sank, claiming 17 victims: the school principal, his wife, two school staff, and 13 pupils. It was one of Ireland’s worst inland drowning tragedies.
In July 2004, a plaque was unveiled at the lake shore adjacent to the path used by those who died. To coincide with the launch local historian Rory Stewart launched a book which provided a clearer insight into the events on that day.

PerfSONAR

perfSONAR ("Performance focused Service Oriented Network monitoring ARchitecture") is an international collaboration for network monitoring. Contributors are the EU funded GN2 JRA1 project, Internet2, ESnet, and RNP. The name of the project reflects the choice of a service-oriented architecture for the software implementation.
Objective.
Many tools have been created to perform measurement in IP networks, but these have usually focused on certain metrics. PerfSONAR aims to bring information together in order to provide a complete picture of a network. 
The variety of network monitoring is an issue in particular in multi-domain environments. For example; in the collaboration of research backbone networks. PerfSONAR targets to hide the differences among the domains to provide an end-to-end view (or at least an edge-to-edge view).
perfSONAR aims to support the following user groups.
For example, a researcher being connected to a local area network (LAN) in a campus would like to transfer data to another researcher located at a LAN in another country. The connection between these two usually makes use of both LANs, perhaps regional networks, national research backbone networks, and international research networks, so that a lot of administratively independent domains are involved. In case of a problem (e.g. low throughput on the connection) it is difficult for the researchers to investigate where the problem may be located in the network (assuming that it is no application issue). perfSONAR aims to collect information from the involved domains.
Framework.
To address the objectives a framework with three layers has been developed to separate measurements, their management and their visualization. 
Measurement Points from the lowest layer in the system (Measurement Point Layer) and are responsible for measuring network metrics. The measurements can be carried out using active or passive monitoring techniques, i.e. by the use of additional test packets or the monitoring of existing packets. Each Measurement Point deals with a specific metric (e.g., one-way delay, one-way-delay variation, packet loss, utilization, available bandwidth).
The Service Layer [HBBD+05] is the middle layer of the framework and consists of administrative domains. It allows for the exchange of measurement data and management information between domains. In each domain, a set of services is responsible for the domain control. Each of them is in charge of a specific functionality, like authentication and authorization, discovery of the other services providing specific functionalities, resource management, or measurement of network traffic parameters. The interaction of the services inside a domain as well as the access to the Measurement Point Layer or other domains may not be visible to the end user. Some of the services contain an interface which can be accessed by the User Interface Layer.
The User Interface Layer consists of visualization tools (user interfaces) which present of measured data according to the needs of specific user groups. In addition, they may allow users to perform tests using the lower layers of the framework.
Web services in the service layer.
The project was developed by small teams located in several countries. For the collaboration of the pieces of software, particularly in the service layer, it favors a loose-coupling. This has led to the choice of a service-oriented architecture. following services are available:
Round-robin database measurement archive.
The service is a wrapper around round robin databases, i.e. it makes data contained in database files available via the perfSONAR interface. Metrics that have been specified in this context are mainly utilization, but also interface input errors and output drops.
Structured Query Language Measurement Archive (SQL MA).
As an alternative to the RRD MA the SQL MA is a wrapper around SQL databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. In addition to the metrics which have been defined for the RRD MA circuit status data can be made available via this MA.
Lookup Service (LS).
This service is a directory service which means that services can register their existence and capabilities. Clients can use the service to search for suitable service. It is realized by using an eXist XML database and XQuery for the data retrieval. In the future the LSs will form a hierarchy so that information is also aggregated and exchanged among them.
HADES Active Delay Evaluation System Measurement Archive (HADES MA).
This service is an archiving services for active measurements of one-way delay, IP delay variation and packet loss. The measurements themselves are carried out by test PC which have been deployed in important network locations. The test PCs also require a Global Positioning System signal for exact time synchronization.
Bandwidth ConTroLer Measurement Point (BWCTL MP).
This service is a wrapper around the BWCTL tool which itself is a wrapper of the Iperf tool. The service is used to measure the achievable bandwidth for TCP and UDP measurement. This means to actively transfer a large stream of data to measure whether it can be effectively delivered to the peer site. In addition to the verifying of protocol configurations, this kind of tests are also useful to detect relatively small amounts of packet loss.
Telnet/Secure Shell Measurement Point (Telnet/SSH MP).
This service provides an abstraction of commands that can be executed on Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks routers. It therefore enables queries to these routers like Border Gateway Protocol commands or IP route commands. The name of the service related to the access to the routers via TELNET or SSH.
Authentication Service (AS).
The use of perfSONAR services is restricted to registered users. The AS has been introduced to verify the identity of a user by the means of eduGAIN. It is going to be extended for authorization functionality, i.e. to have detailed rights for what a user can do based on his attributes.
Command Line Measurement Point (CL MP).
This service is used for executing command line tools such ping, traceroute, OWAMP and BWCTL.
perfSONAR-BUOY.
This service is an archive for measurements with OWAMP and BWCTL.
PingER Services.
These services are an evolution of the PingER Project and are composed of both a storage backend (MA) and measurement frontend (MP) to conduct and store ping measurements and to make available such data. Network characteristics supported include availability, delay and delay variation.
common Network Information Service (cNIS)/Topology Service.
cNIS (developed by the GN2 project) and Topology Service (developed by Internet2) are services which provide information about the topology of a network. cNIS contains more information since it has also been developed for topology needs for other activities being part of the GN2 project.
End-to-end Monitoring Measurement Point and Measurement Archive (E2EMon MP and MA).
These service collect data about multi-domain circuits which are composed out of segments. For the segment an abstract status with the values up and down is determined from vendor-specific information (e.g. AlcatelLucent or Huawei management systems). The status data are composed to derive end-to-end status data.

William Gwynn (1856 - 1 April 1897) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Swansea and would later become secretary of the Welsh Rugby Union. Gwynn was an all-round sportsman and as well as his success on the rugby pitch he also player cricket for Swansea, of which he became vice-president, and Glamorgan. Gwynn had also played association football and had captained Battersea College XI through two undefeated seasons. He would later become a referee and would officiate the very first football game between Swansea Town and Cardiff City.
Rugby career.
Gould played most of his club rugby with Swansea, following his elder brother David into the team. He joined the club in 1880 and would captain the team in the 1884/85 and 1885/86 season. Gwynn was first selected to represent Wales in the opening game of the 1884 Home Nations Championship, against England. Under the captaincy of Charlie Newman, Wales lost to the English, but to a far close score line than the first two encounters. Gwynn was reselected for the next two Welsh international games, the first against Scotland, where he was partnered with Newman; and then Ireland with new half-back partner William Stadden. Gwynn should have scored in the Scotland game, but looked for support rather than touch the ball down when he had crossed the Scottish line. Gwynn played in two more games for Wales, both in the 1885 Home Nations Championship, a loss to England and a draw against Scotland.

Frank Talk

Frank Talk was a political magazine established in 1984 in South Africa, and arising out of the student-led anti-apartheid movement of the 1970s and 80s. Originally the pseudonym under which Steve Biko wrote several articles as the Publications Director of the South African Students' Organisation (SASO), "Frank Talk" became the title of the magazine published by the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO), a nationalist group committed to Biko's ideas of Black Consciousness.
Biko's prolific SASO writings were published in early volumes of Frank Talk, and throughout its history the magazine remained committed to the Black Consciousness ideology responsible for mobilizing student-led anti-apartheid resistance. Exploring the theory of Black Consciousness and related issues of race and racism, theology, culture, and revolution, "Frank Talk" became a platform for rigorous political analysis of the frustrations and problems of black students and black people generally. Available in both Afrikaans and English, several issues of the journal were banned for distribution by South Africa's apartheid government. The last issue of Frank Talk was published in 1990.

One of Us, One of Them

"One of Us, One of Them" is the third episode of the third season of the NBC science fiction drama series "Heroes" and thirty-seventh episode overall. It was written by Joe Pokaski and directed by Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. The episode aired on September 29, 2008.
Plot.
The episode opens with Angela Petrelli speaking with Sylar. She tells him that he is her son, stating that he knew all along he wasn't the son of a watchmaker. She tells him she gave him up for adoption, then calls in a woman named Bridget, who has the power to view the history and past of any object she touches, including who has touched it in the past. Sylar asks what she is going to do to him, and Angela tells him that she is going to feed him. The scene ends with Angela walking away down a corridor, and the familiar sound of Sylar splitting a skull open along with screaming.
The next scene opens with Tracy Strauss freezing the petals on a flower.
Nathan Petrelli waits impatiently for Tracy's arrival. Future Peter teleports into the room. Nathan asks him where his brother is, and Future Peter says he's looking for him. Nathan tells him about a phone message he received from Peter, with someone else's voice, warning him to be on the lookout for Future Peter.
Tracy travels to New Orleans to learn more about Niki Sanders, and there the funeral is about to begin. Tracy discovers Niki lying in a coffin and is startled at their resemblance. She closes the coffin and turns to leave, only to find Niki's now-orphaned son Micah standing behind her. Bewildered, Micah mistakes Tracy for Niki at first, but quickly realizes Tracy isn't his mother and, after they have a talk, he decides to help her. He uses his powers on a laptop and discovers that Tracy and Niki were born on the same day, in the same hospital and with the same doctor: a man named Zimmerman. Micah gives Tracy a hug goodbye, which for Tracy is awkward; Tracy then leaves to meet Zimmerman in California, so she can find out more about her past and origin.
The next scene opens with Knox, Flint, The German, and Jesse's body, which Present Peter is still inside. They walk into a bank, and begin robbing it. Flint scares the customers inside with his flame throwing ability, giving Knox strength. The German works on the combination to the safe, and Peter does his best to keep peace.
On Level 5, Angela and Noah Bennet discuss his terms. He says he is back to re-imprison Knox, Flint, Jesse and the German. When Noah asks for his old partner, The Haitian, Angela says he is unavailable, and pairs him with Sylar instead. She sends Noah and Sylar to defuse the hostage situation at the bank.
When the situation at the bank escalates, Bennet and Sylar arrive at the bank. During a heated discussion, Knox kills the German. The villains want to start killing people, but Peter, in Jesse's body, tries to stop them. Bennet enters the bank alone, making Sylar wait outside. Bennet prepares to apprehend Knox and Flint. The two get the upper hand on Bennet until Peter learns to control Jesse's power and pushes the two away with a loud scream. Suddenly time gets frozen by Future Peter. He releases the current Peter out of Jesse's body and invites Peter to come along with him to witness the future, and Peter agrees and they leave. When time returns to normal, Bennet thanks Peter (because he thinks Peter is still in Jesse's body), but the real Jesse says "Peter isn't here right now" and proceeds to attack Bennet. Sylar enters and uses his telekinesis to stop Knox from punching Bennet and to choke Jesse so he couldn't use his sound. Bennet arrests Flint and walks out of the bank. Sylar, however, is too tempted by the criminals' powers, and ultimately gives in to his "hunger," locking all the doors so he can kill Jesse. With Sylar focused on Jesse, Knox takes the opportunity to escape.
Hiro and Ando have a run-in with the Haitian while following Daphne. Hiro and Ando have a discussion with Daphne, who attempts to drive Hiro and Ando apart. Hiro and Daphne discover they can't use their powers anymore when the Haitian arrives. Hiro and Ando follow the Haitian, who gets the other half of the formula that could destroy the world from an unknown English-sounding woman. It is mentioned that the Haitian is now working for Angela, who wanted the formula closer to home. Hiro and Ando knock the Haitian out and get the formula, but Daphne manages to steal it from them. Hiro and Ando are unable to escape before the Haitian wakes up again. They are arrested and taken to Level 2 in the Company.
Claire seeks advice from Meredith. They train in an empty shipping container, and when Meredith asks why she wants to learn how to fight, Claire replies that she "wants to help people". Knowing that she is lying, Meredith "tortures" Claire by heating up the metal around them and reducing the level of oxygen until Claire admits that she wants to hurt Sylar for what he did to her. They return home where Sandra Bennet, after receiving a call from the school regarding Claire's whereabouts, confronts Meredith on how to raise Claire. Claire later discovers a box with files on super-powered people from her father (the same box Sylar went through in "The Second Coming") and sneaks away to track them down.
In Africa, Matt Parkman continues his spirit walk with the strange native who has precognitive painting powers, similar to those of Isaac Mendez. The native reveals that he has painted Matt's life ever since he was a boy. They reach the native's house, and Matt is shown numerous paintings of himself, mostly beginning from when he discovered his powers. The native tells him that one painting has to change. The native paints over an image of Matt with a woman (who distinctly resemble Daphne, the speedster Hiro is currently confronting) and a baby that has no longer come to pass, replacing it with a scene where Matt grieves over a dead woman he holds in his arms. Matt later wants to know what this all means, and the native invites Matt into his house, where Matt takes a seat and he is seen eating something that the native has given him. Matt tells the native that he does not feel anything. The native gives Matt his Walkman and says this will help. Matt's eyes then turn white and his pupils vanish, as when the native and Isaac Mendez use their power. Matt then begins to learn about the future.
Tracy arrives in California and visits Zimmerman at his home, where he mistakenly calls her "Barbara". Tracy corrects him, then asks if he knew her. Zimmerman replies "Know you? I created you."
At the company, Hiro and Ando are both in a cell, Flint is brought back to his cell, as is Sylar. Angela however refuses to give up on him and still believes Sylar can amount to something good. Bennet disagrees, and tells the Haitian that he is just trying to find Sylar's weakness, so he can eventually kill him.
Critical Reception.
In the 18-49 demographic, "One of Us, One of Them" earned a 4.4/10 ratings share. The episode was watched by 9.34 million viewers.
Sean O'Neal of "The A.V. Club" rated this episode a D.

"I Am Become Death" is the fourth episode of the third season of the NBC science fiction drama series "Heroes" and thirty-eighth episode overall. It was written by Aron Coleite and directed by David Von Ancken. The episode aired on October 6, 2008.
Plot.
Peter travels four years into the future with his future self, in order to learn what he can. To the horror of both Peters, Kaito's formula is now being used to administer adrenal power enhancements to ordinary people, some of whom are unable or unwilling to control their abilities. Future Peter tells Present Peter that Sylar's intuitive aptitude can help to understand the cause and effect of time travel, thereby enabling the Peters to fix the problematic future. Almost immediately, the Claire of this future assassinates future Peter, claiming he is a terrorist. Because the Haitian is present, Future Peter cannot regenerate and dies. Present Peter flees, avoiding Claire's partner, The Haitian, and begins searching for Mohinder. 
Mohinder, whose mutation has progressed much further and is hiding alone in shadows, tries in vain to stop himself from informing Present Peter that Sylar is living in Costa Verde, as Peter reads his mind. Teleporting to Costa Verde and expecting a fight, Peter finds that a friendly Sylar has reassumed his former identity of Gabriel Gray, and is now raising his young son, Noah, in Claire's former home. A desperate Peter tries to steal Gabriel's ability, but is resisted, arguing that his power comes at the dangerous risk of a predatory appetite for 'understanding', which Gabriel himself now barely controls for the sake of his son. He reveals to Peter that they are brothers. 
In the present, Hiro and Ando are imprisoned in the Company's cell, arguing over their hurt feelings from Daphne's tactics. Matt Parkman, still on his "spirit walk," has a vision of the same future Peter is visiting in which he and Daphne are raising Molly and an infant together.
In the future, Peter convinces Gabriel to paint the future and see the coming devastation. Convinced, Gabriel finally teaches Peter his power by having Peter fix his watch; the same watch from the present time which he carries as a "scar". Gabriel regretfully tells Peter he has his power now, and the inevitable "hunger" which comes with it. Future Claire, Knox and Daphne show up to kill Peter, having learned his whereabouts from Molly. They hold Gabriel and Peter at bay by taking Gabriel's son, Noah, as a hostage, but when Knox accidentally kills the child, an enraged Gabriel beats Knox into submission and loses control of his radiation ability. Peter tries in vain to stop Gabriel before he explodes, reducing Costa Verde to nuclear waste, and killing over 200,000 people. Peter and Claire survive due to their regeneration powers and Claire takes Peter back to the base. Daphne the speedster runs and manages to get back to Matt and Molly. Fatally wounded from the blast, she tells Matt that she "wasn't fast enough" before collapsing in his arms, fulfilling the image that Usutu has painted. 
Nathan, who in this future is the President and married to Tracy, attempts to reason with Peter, offering Peter the opportunity to read his mind to see if he's sincere. Peter nearly kills Nathan upon gaining a morbid curiosity of how Nathan's mind works due to Sylar's powers. Angry and horrified with himself, Peter stops short of cutting Nathan's head open and teleports back to the present Level 5, where he enters Sylar's prison cell for an angry confrontation, in which Sylar confirms that he is Peter's brother. 
In the present, Tracy attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. However, under advice from Linderman, Nathan flies in and saves her. Later, she shows Nathan her ability by freezing his glass. The two then kiss.
Hiro and Ando, finally resolving their differences, try to escape through a vent and are caught by the Haitian. Later, Angela Petrelli mentions that Hiro's father would have been disappointed with him for losing both portions of the formula, which can be used to give powers to anyone. A disheartened Hiro apologizes, only to have Ando proudly proclaim that Hiro will not rest until the formula is retrieved. Angela alludes to Hiro that he already has "the key" to doing this. The scene switches to Hiro and Ando in a graveyard, digging up Adam Monroe who, upon seeing Hiro, lunges at him. The episode ends with Adam saying; "Hiro, you son of a...".
Throughout the episode, Mohinder is researching a possible cure for the powers he's given himself, verbally lashing out at Maya. Mohinder's aggression continues to increase when he intervenes in a domestic dispute of his neighbors, beating the man. Later, Mohinder is attacked by the neighbor for sticking his nose where it doesn't belong. With a smile, Mohinder responds by dragging the man into his apartment.
Reception.

Valentin de Foronda

Valentin de Foronda y González de Echávarri, (Vitoria, 14 February 1751 – 24 December 1821), was Spanish General Consul in Philadelphia from 1801 to 1807 and Spanish Plenipotentiary Minister in the U.S.A. from 1807 to 1809—tense times because of American ship's lack of discipline in trading with Cuba and the U.S.A.'s support for Francisco de Miranda who led an attempted revolution for Venezuelan independence from Spain.
He returned to Spain upon the arrival of Luis Onís, who replaced him, and who was nominated by the "Junta Patriótica" opposed to the invaion of Spain by Napoleon Bonaparte.
He taught at the Basque Institutional School, known as Seminario de Vergara, was promoted to Knight of the Military Order of Santiago in 1793, a Knight of the Order of Carlos III in 1801 and was later a member of the American Philosophical Society. 
His letter of November 1799 to the then Spanish Secretary of State Mariano Luis de Urquijo, concerning the financial crushing of the "Banco de San Carlos", a precursor to the actual Bank of Spain, where he had invested the proceeds of sale of his land and farms, probably resulted in his diplomatic nomination to the Spanish Consulate in Philadelphia.
His "Observaciones sobre algunos puntos de la Obra de Don Quijote", Philadelphia (1807), has motivated his inclusion on the short list of people phobic against world famous Seventeenth Century Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, (September 29, 1547 – April 23, 1616).

Babe Stovall

Jewell Stovall, better known as Babe Stovall (October 14, 1907 – September 21, 1974) was an American Delta blues singer and guitarist.
Stovall was born in Tylertown, Mississippi, United States, in 1907, the youngest of eleven children (thus his nickname "Babe"). He learned to play the guitar by the age of eight, and his guitar playing style was influenced by Tommy Johnson, whom he had met in Mississippi around 1930. Later he relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he entertained on the streets, and in cafes and galleries of the French Quarter. He variously played his guitar at the back of his neck, and hollered his song lyrics loudly for all in the vicinity to hear. In 1964 he recorded an album for Verve, titled "Babe Stovall" (which was re-released in 1990 on CD), and undertook more recordings in 1966, released as "The Babe Stovall Story". His later work with Bob West resulted in "The Old Ace: Mississippi Blues & Religious Songs", which was released on Arcola (2003). 
Stovall played on the college circuit, in addition to being the regular musician at the Dream Castle Bar and The Quarum club in New Orleans. 
His death in 1974 was by natural causes.

Luís de Azevedo

Luís de Azevedo (born at Carrazedo de Montenegro, in the Diocese of Braga, in Portugal, in 1573; died in Ethiopia in 1634) was a Portuguese Jesuit scholar and missionary.
Life.
He became a Jesuit in 1588, and sailed for the East Indies in 1592. In 1605 he began his missionary work in Ethiopia, where he remained until his death. Azevedo was called the Apostle Agarus.
Works.
He translated into Chaldaic the commentaries of Father Toletus on the "Epistles of St. Paul to the Romans" and those of Francis Ribera on the "Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews"; the "Canonical Hours", the "Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary", and other works. He is the author of a grammar of the Ethiopic language, and translated into the same tongue the New Testament, a Portuguese catechism, instructions on the Apostles' Creed, and other books of the same nature. Azevedo concentrated on the Ge'ez language, rather than Amharic, since Ge'ez was the language of literacy.

EPPI-Centre

The Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre) is part of the Social Science Research Unit at the Institute of Education, University of London. Its work is concerned with systematic reviews which use transparent and explicit methodologies for reviewing research evidence in order to be clear about what we know from research and how we know it. 
Methods for Research Synthesis.
A major focus of the EPPI-Centre is the development of methods of systematic reviews including systematic mapping and synthesis. The Centre is the Methods for Research Synthesis (MRS) Node of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) National Centre for Research Methods.
The Centre has adapted the model of systematic reviews that has been widely developed in healthcare to address a broader range of questions and methodologies relevant to public policy research such as statistical, narrative and conceptual synthesis. 
Working with a range of users.
The EPPI-Centre's programme of work seeks to develop ways of working with various groups of research and service ‘users’ throughout the review process, including deciding which topics need most urgently to be reviewed, and analyzing and disseminating the results of reviews. 
A particular aim is to explore the perspectives and participation of those people who are, or represent, people receiving a service or who are affected by the service in some other way. This might include: patients in a clinical encounter; students in a classroom; people receiving, missing or avoiding health promotion interventions; or students and parents in relation to an education policy. 
Evidence Library.
The EPPI-Centre conducts systematic reviews of research evidence across a range of topics. Major areas include education, health promotion, employment, social care and justice.
The reviews on these topics can be found in an Online Evidence Library, which provides evidence overviews of broad topic areas as well as summaries and full reports of specific reviews conducted or supported by the EPPI-Centre.
Collaborative Partnerships.
Work at the EPPI-Centre is funded by a range of research councils, government departments and charities and national and international partners. The EPPI-centre has strong links with two international collaborations concerned with policy-relevant reviews of research evidence: the Cochrane Collaboration in health care and the Campbell collaboration for social interventions.
Teaching and Learning.
The EPPI-Centre offers a large programme of training and workshops on methodological and practical aspects of systematic research synthesis, including an MSc in Research for Public Policy and Practice. The Centre offers face-to-face and online distance short courses in Systematic reviews for policy and practice; Participative research and policy; and Methods for research synthesis. 
EPPI-Reviewer software.
EPPI-Reviewer is a web application that enables researchers to manage the entire lifecycle of a review in a single location. Users are able to upload studies for screening, complete keywording and data extractions and analyse the results over the internet. Analytical functions include meta-analysis, summary tables and support for qualitative synthesis.

RTI-336, (LS-193,309, (-)-2β-(3-(4-methylphenyl)isoxazol-5-yl)-3β-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane) is a phenyltropane derivative which acts as a potent and selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor and stimulant drug. It binds to the dopamine transporter with around 20x the affinity of cocaine, however it produces relatively mild stimulant effects, with a slow onset and long duration of action. These characteristics make it a potential candidate for treatment of cocaine addiction, as a possible substitute drug analogous to how methadone is used for treating heroin abuse. RTI-336 fully substitutes for cocaine in addicted monkeys and supports self-administration, and significantly reduces rates of cocaine use, especially when combined with SSRIs, and research is ongoing to determine whether it could be a viable substitute drug in human cocaine addicts.
Update.

<doc id="18660897" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18660897" title="Seep (hydrology)">
Seep (hydrology)

A seep is a moist or wet place where water, usually groundwater, reaches the earth's surface from an underground aquifer. 
Description.
Seeps are usually not of sufficient volume to be flowing beyond their above-ground location. They are part of the limnology-geomorphology system. Like a higher volume spring, the water is only from underground sources. Seeps mostly occur in lower elevation areas because water runs downhill, but can happen higher up if the groundwater present is abundant enough. Along with natural seeps, man made seeps can occur by digging anywhere where there is wet ground. This method can be useful for survival purposes and helps the local wildlife by adding another water source to the area.
Seeps often form a puddle, and are important for small wildlife, bird, and butterfly habitat and moisture needs. When they support mud-puddling many butterfly ("Lepidoptera") species can obtain nutrients such as salts and amino acids, including some types that are endemic endangered species.
Environmental technology.
Seep is often used in environmental sciences to define an exfiltration zone (seepage zone) where contaminated water, e.g., from waste dumps, leaves a waste system area.
Seeps are often important smaller wildlife water sources, and indicated by lower riparian vegetation.
Stream recharge system.
Seeps can also contribute to streams. If a stream is flowing below a water table then the stream receives contributions from the ground water via seepage. This allows for a drainage of the ground water along with creating a more substantial stream to flow. The seep could be especially effective during a rain-less period of the area in which the seep can actually prolong the stream’s flow by adding water from the groundwater.

Thulin K

__NOTOC__
The Thulin K was a Swedish naval fighter aircraft in the 1910s. It was operated by both the Swedish and Dutch armed forces.
Development.
Dr. Enoch Thulin, of AB Thulinverken, designed the Thulin K in December 1916. It was a shoulder-wing monoplane of wooden construction employing wing warping for lateral control. Powered by a 90 hp Thulin A Gnôme derived rotary engine, it could be configured as a single seat or tandem seat aircraft.
Operational history.
After initial flights in early 1917, the Swedish Army purchased two of the single seat K versions. However, it was more successful as an export plane; the Royal Netherlands Navy bought twelve Ks between 1917 and 1918 and three Thulin KAs. Both types were delivered without armament but the Dutch Navy fitted theirs with machine guns firing through the propeller arc and also experimented with 20 mm Madson cannons.
The aircraft's performance was good - Thulin himself broke the Swedish altitude record in it in 1919. However, on 14 May 1919 Thulin's own Thulin K lost an aileron in a steep dive, crashing and killing him. The rest of the Thulin Ks were written off in 1920 and the Thulin KAs were withdrawn in 1922.

Duke of Faial

Duke of Faial (in Portuguese "Duque do Faial") is a Portuguese title of nobility granted by royal decree of Queen Maria II of Portugal, dated from April 4, 1833, to "Dom" Pedro de Sousa Holstein (1781–1850), a Portuguese politician during the first half of the 19th century. He was President of the Council of Ministers (Head of the Portuguese Government) and a remarkable Ambassador in London and to the Congress of Vienna. 
Background.
When the Queen granted to "Dom" Pedro de Sousa Holstein the title of Duke of Faial, he was already 1st Count of Palmela (royal decree of 1812) and 1st Marquis of Palmela (royal decree of 1823). Due to his services to the Crown and Country, he obtained the ranking of Duke, as Duke of Faial.
Later a royal decree of the Queen, dated from October 18, 1850, changed his original title to Duke of Palmela.

Woodside railway station was opened by July 1871 by the Mid-Kent Railway, to serve the nearby race course: a ramp facilitated the loading of racehorses. After the course closed in 1890, use of the station decreased. The down bay platform fell into disuse in 1917 following closure of the line to Selsdon, reopened upon electrification in 1935 with through services to London. By the early 1960s patronage was in decline. The small goods yard closed in 1963. The line to Selsdon closed in 1983 and the signal box at the south end of the down platform closed in 1984. Through services to London were withdrawn and train services were reduced to a shuttle service between Addiscombe and Elmers End. The station building at street level over the platforms was destaffed in 1993 and was boarded up. In 1996 Addiscombe signal box was burnt down and single-line working was introduced with all trains using the down line and the up platform falling into disuse . Closure came the following year (1997) in preparation for the construction of Croydon Tramlink.
Tramlink now uses the line between Elmers End and Coombe Road. Most of the platforms were demolished and new tram platforms constructed. Part of the Up platform was left to provide access to the tram platforms, using the stairs to the street-level building, which is boarded up and abandoned.
