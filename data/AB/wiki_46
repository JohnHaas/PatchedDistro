Postage stamps and postal history of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate.
The Southern Nigeria Protectorate was a British protectorate in the coastal areas of modern-day Nigeria, formed in 1900 from union of the Niger Coast Protectorate with territories chartered by the Royal Niger Company below Lokoja on the Niger River. The Lagos Colony was added in 1906, and the territory was officially renamed the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. In 1914, Southern Nigeria was joined with Northern Nigeria to form the single colony of Nigeria.
First stamps.
The Protectorate initially using the postage stamps of the Coast Protectorate, in March 1901 a set of nine values, depicting Queen Victoria in a 3/4 portrait, went on sale.
Edward VII.
The stamps of Queen Victoria were replaced by stamps of Edward VII in 1903. The design, a profile of the King, continued in use throughout his reign, with changes of color, watermark and paper. The 1d. value was redrawn in 1910, and is distinguishable by the "1" in "1d" being thinner, while the "d" is taller and broader.
George V.
In 1912, the vignette was replaced with a portrait of George V, for a set of 12, with values ranging from 1/2d. to £1.

Ein Shemer

Ein Shemer is a kibbutz in Israel in the Shomron region, surrounded by citrus groves, orchards and fields. It is located just south of Route 65, about 6 km northeast of Hadera, and is in the Menashe Regional Council. The kibbutz was founded in 1927. The kibbutz makes a living from agriculture and industry as well as work of individual members outside the kibbutz. The children study at the regional council elementary school, and at the kibbutz-oriented high school, Mevo'ot 'Iron.
History.
In 1913 a small group of young Jews belonging to the HaShomer (Watchmen's) organization chose to establish a guard post near the entrance to Wadi 'Ara, which would also serve as a way station for travelers between the Mediterranean coast and the Galilee.
From then on, the place was inhabited on-and-off by a few groups of pioneers, each of which was driven away by the harsh conditions – malaria, lack of water (until 1935, water had to be brought in by horse and cart from nearby Karkur), remoteness from any other settlement, and World War I which was raging and making life difficult.
In 1921, after British takeover of the land from the Ottoman Turks, members of Gdud HaAvoda, the Work Battalion, arrived in order to build a one-acre, fortified courtyard. They constructed a two-meter high stone wall with slits for shooting at attackers and a large, iron gate. A solitary, two-story stone building was also constructed which was intended to house the local people in times of trouble. The house was built in the style of 19th century houses in southern France and stands on the site to this day. Despite the large investment and effort expended on building the wall and the house, the members of Gdud HaAvodah left only a small contingent to stay on after completion of the construction. Of these, eventually only one person remained, who would later become the first member of Kibbutz Ein Shemer. His name was Shmuel Shuali and he was affectionately called Shmuel the First by his fellow kibbutz members and by what would be future generations of kibbutzniks.
In 1927, the first pioneers of HaShomer HaTzair arrived at the site. The group consisted of 18 women and 36 men, all in their late teens and early twenties. These youngsters left behind parents, homes, and future careers in order to fulfill their dream of revitalizing the Jewish people in its ancient homeland, to work the land with their own hands and to make the Zionist vision come true.
They had immigrated from Poland and had at first lived and worked at Ein Ganim near Petah Tikva, awaiting the opportunity to settle and make their contribution in Eretz Israel. Shavuot 1927 is considered the date of the founding of the kibbutz. In the coming years, more groups of HaShomer HaTzair pioneers from Poland joined the first group. Each group had its own name – Binyamina, Shomriya, BaDerech – which it kept even as its members were integrated into the kibbutz.
The hardships that these early settlers endured, like other pioneers who founded other kibbutzim, were great. Eighty years later, it is hard to grasp the enormity of the self-sacrifice that they made in leaving their childhood homes, families, relatives, language and native land. Many of them came from affluent families and most never saw their families again. The lives of the kibbutz members were almost unbearable and 80 of the 100 first members fell ill with malaria. In 1934 the kibbutz was finally hooked up to the electric grid, and only in 1935 water was found on the site, leading to a revolution in the development of the farmstead and to the erection of a local water tower.
As members of HaShomer HaTzair, the founders sought ways to bring about cooperation and friendly relations with their Arab neighbors, and social contact was slowly made with the farmers of the area. Yet during the 1930s and 1940s there were security concerns and tension. In 1938 two members of the kibbutz were murdered in an attack by an Arab gang. Following World War II kibbutz members took part in the so-called "illegal" immigration of Holocaust survivors to the Land of Israel, which was prohibited under the British Mandate. When British soldiers raided neighboring Kibbutz Giv'at Haim in 1945, Ein Shemer members rushed to the defense of that kibbutz and of the right of Jews to immigrate to the Land of Israel. In the ensuing combat one member, Elimelech Shtarkman, was killed and several others were wounded.
From the 1940s onward, scores of new members joined the kibbutz, some of them HaShomer HaTzair members from Egypt and the Balkans, which doubled the population of Ein Shemer. Others came through the Youth Aliya organization from Europe after the Holocaust and native Israelis also joined through several groups and individually. This diverse flow of new members greatly enriched the social character of the kibbutz. Ein Shemer gradually stopped absorbing groups; its population since then has increased mainly by absorbing the partners of the second and third generation of members who chose to make the kibbutz their home.
Kibbutz Ein Shemer is one of the founders of HaKibbutz HaArtzi, the settlement movement of HaShomer HaTzair, and was one of the first four such kibbutzim (today there are 85 in the movement out of a total of about 265 kibbutzim). Among Ein Shemer's members have been prominent personalities in state and movement institutions, including: Zvi Lurie, one of the signers of the Israeli Declaration of Independence; Israel (Kurt) Hertz, one of the leaders of the Histadrut; Ya'kov (Kuba) Riftin, a six-time Knesset member from the Mapam party; and David (Dado) Elazar, a member of the Yugoslavian youth group on Ein Shemer who went on to become commander-in-chief of the Israel Defense Forces.
Etymology.
Ein – Because the founders of the kibbutz originally belonged to a gar'in group named Ein Ganim
Because of their aspiration to find a spring of water – ayin – ein on the land – which eventually came to pass.
Shemer – Because members of HaShomer group set up a guard post on the spot
Because the kibbutz founders belonged to HaShomer HaTzair youth group
Because the kibbutz is situated within the area of the Biblical kingdom of Shemer, king of the Shomron.
Economy.
The kibbutz economy in the early years was based primarily on agriculture: flocks of sheep, herds of cows, orchards, orange groves and field crops. Ein Shemer member Abba Stein developed the Anna and the Ein Shemer, two species of apples now grown in various places in the world, as well as other species of apples and plums. Another member, Moshe Grossman, was one of the founders of Granot, an agricultural co-operative that has since become a major economical force in the Israeli agricultural market. Beginning in the 1970s the agricultural branches of the kibbutz were reduced in size and now include cotton and other field crops, avocado groves and cowsheds. Industrial and commercial branches were established and gained prominence in the kibbutz economy. A rubber factory, Ein Shemer Rubber Industries and a plastics factory, Miniplast Ein Shemer, were set up on the kibbutz in 1968 and 1976 respectively, and a small shopping center for the general public was established at the Karkur intersection nearby. Other sources of kibbutz income are from members who work outside the kibbutz, as well as personal initiatives such as the artistic blacksmith's forge, ecological greenhouse, film production company, event planning company, architect's office, center for holistic treatments and others.
In the mid 1980s Ein Shemer, together with much of the kibbutz movement, underwent a severe economic downturn as a result of the monetary policy of the new right-wing Israeli government. At the end of the 1990s the kibbutz emerged from the crisis after signing an agreement among the kibbutz, the banks and the Israeli Land Administration.
At about the same time as the economic crisis, the kibbutz underwent a social transformation, as the center of social life went from the collective to the family unit. In the 1980s the children, who had slept in children's houses since the kibbutz was founded, began sleeping in their parents' homes. During the 1990s many items of consumption were privatized and the members' personal budgets were enlarged as the communal budget decreased in scope. Since about 2000, an ongoing discussion has been raging concerning possible future distribution of differential salaries to the members – an issue that has not yet been decided upon .
Education and culture.
Since its founding, the kibbutz has always made education one of its main priorities. The kibbutz children were given special, preferential conditions. They lived in a children's house with their peers, under the guidance of dedicated educators who nurtured in them a love of nature, humanity, a sense of justice and cooperation. Over the years the characteristics of kibbutz education changed, yet to this day kibbutz education is considered among the finest in the country. Ein Shemer's kindergartens have a special kibbutz character, based on treating each child individually and holistically, and at the same time creating a deep connection between the children, their natural surrounding and the community. Another unique educational enterprise is the regional high school, Mevo'ot 'Iron, which was founded in 1949 by members of Kibbutz Ein Shemer and which other kibbutzim, Ma'anit, Barkai, and Metzer later joined. Today the school is a drawing point for young people throughout the area, and has about 1,000 pupils, including young immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union.
For many years Ein Shemer had one of the leading volleyball teams in Israel, and during the 1950s and 1960s the men's and women's teams were at the top of the national league. One of the high points for local sports fans was the game held in 1960 between HaPoel Ein Shemer and Galatasarai, a Turkish team, for which a playing court and bleachers were built on the kibbutz and still stand. Today Ein Shemer is a partner in a regional volleyball team, HaMa'apil-Ein-Shemer-Menashe.
All through the years, the kibbutz has been known for its innumerable artists and intellectuals, far out of proportion to those of the general Israeli public or of other kibbutzim. In the first generation some of the prominent figures were: writers Moshe Zertal, Zvi Lurie, Rivka Gurfine and Zvi Arad; poets Azriel Uchmani and Arieh Shamri, caricaturist and artist Yitzhak (Ignatz) Palgi, architect Ya'akov (Kuba) Gever and many others.
Among the second generation, of the sons and daughters of the kibbutz, are poet and author Eli Alon, artists Avital Geva and Tzilla Lis, archaeologist and author Adam Zertal, thinker and writer Avishai Grossman, educator and writer Rafael (Rafi) Shapira, musician Miri Grossberg, Uri Hofi an internationally known teacher and Artist Blacksmith and many others. 
Notable talents of the third generation include: author Rakefet Zohar, cinematographer Oren Tirosh, musician Zamir Golan and artist Atar Geva.
Landmarks.
The Old Courtyard is a reconstruction museum depicting early kibbutz settlement in Israel. Founded over 20 years ago, it stands upon the original one-acre site where the first pioneers established the kibbutz and features indoor and outdoor exhibits of the early years of kibbutz life, as well as pioneering activities such as bread baking for children and youths. Its other attractions include an operable oil press, the oak train (a reconstruction of the Ottoman Turkish train that ran through the region at the beginning of the last century), an exhibit of tractors and agricultural machinery from the early 20th century and others.
The Ecological Greenhouse is an educational center dealing with ecology and social commitment. Jewish and Arab youths participate in seminars and workshops devoted to peaceful co-existence, ecology, environment and scientific research.
Hofi's Forge consists of a smithy, an exhibition hall and a school for blacksmiths founded over 20 years ago by Uri Hofi, a world acclaimed blacksmith-artisan.
On the grounds of the kibbutz is a relief sculpture of the renowned sculptor Natan Rappaport (not a kibbutz member), commemorating both the operations that brought so-called "illegal" Jewish immigrants to the Land of Israel and the participation of Ein Shemer members in those operations. Another notable monument is one by sculptor Rudlinger (member of Kibbutz HaZore'a), commemorating two paratroopers, Kibbutz Ein Shemer members, who were killed in the Six-Day War in 1967.

USS Cinchona (AN-12)

USS "Cinchona" (AN-12/YN-7) was an "Aloe"-class net laying ship which was assigned to serve the U.S. Navy during World War II with her protective anti-submarine nets.
Built in Portland, Oregon.
"Cinchona" (YN-7) was launched 2 July 1941 by Commercial Iron Works, Portland, Oregon; sponsored by Mrs. W. Casey; outfitted by Puget Sound Navy Yard; and placed in service 15 August 1941, Lieutenant H. H. Breed, USNR, in charge.
World War II service.
Assigned to the 14th Naval District, she arrived at Pearl Harbor 17 October where she took up duty in net repair and replacement, salvage of gear lost or adrift, and maintenance of net and boom defenses. 
Under attack at Pearl Harbor.
During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941, "Cinchona" manned both her machine guns and her 3" gun, and, as the enemy repeatedly strafed her deck, she closed the gaps in the net defenses protecting the dry-docks. 
Continuing her salvage operations in the Hawaiian group, "Cinchona" salvaged district patrol craft "YP-108" off Lanai in June 1942, and in August escorted a motor torpedo boat convoy to Midway Islands, where she installed nets around the dock spaces, returning to Pearl Harbor early in September. 
She was placed in commission 20 December 1942, her officer-in-charge Lieutenant T. A. Ingham receiving the title commanding officer. She continued local operations at Pearl Harbor, and on 20 January 1944 was redesignated "AN-12".
Saipan operations.
"Cinchona" arrived off newly invaded Saipan 16 June 1944. She conducted patrols, assisted "LST-84" after an enemy bomb started a fire on board, then inspected the Japanese net line in Tanapag Harbor. She remained at Saipan on salvage and net operations until 18 November when she steamed to Guam and Ulithi to lay cables. 
From 7 December 1944 to 30 June 1945 "Cinchona" conducted net operations, laid moorings, and aided in installing a pipeline at Guam. 
Post-war activity.
Returning to the States 27 July, she conducted net operations at Long Beach, California, and out of Mare Island Naval Shipyard until 24 August 1946 when she sailed for Astoria, Oregon.
Post-war decommissioning.
"Cinchona" was placed out of commission in reserve 6 November 1946 at Vancouver, Washington.
Honors and awards.
"Cinchona" received two battle stars for World War II service. The first was for her performance at Pearl Harbor while under attack by Japanese planes. The second was for her operating under dangerous conditions during the Mariana Islands operation.

Sandside was a railway station situated on the Hincaster Branch of the Furness Railway. The following station was Heversham, which was the last on the branch before the line joined what is now known as the West Coast Main Line at "Hincaster Junction", south of Oxenholme.
A Furness Railway local passenger train service (known locally as the "Kendal Tommy" for much of its life) operated through Sandside from Grange-over-Sands to Kendal between 1876 and its withdrawal in May 1942, when the station also closed to passengers. In July 1922, this FR service ran five times per day in each direction on weekdays. Through goods traffic ended in 1963 and the track was lifted north of here three years later, although the remaining stub down to Arnside was retained until final closure in 1972 to serve local quarries.

He was for a time Vicar at St Columb Major in Cornwall and had a strong interest in the use of the Cornish language. Carew, who published his survey of Cornwall in 1602, notices the almost total extirpation of the Cornish language in his days. He says: "The principal love and knowledge of this language liveth in Dr. Kennall, the civilian, and with him lieth buried".
The link between the Cornish language and Catholicism was also exhibited in the activities of Kennall, at St Columb, where he was still holding Mass as late as 1590.

Myelois circumvoluta

The Thistle Ermine, Myelois circumvoluta, is a small moth species of the family Pyralidae. It is found in Europe.
This pyralid has a pattern of black dots on its whitish forewings, resembling many ermine moths (family Yponomeutidae). Among the Lepidoptera, the pyralids and the ermine moths are not closely related, however: the latter are basal Ditrysia, while the former belong to the much more advanced Obtectomera.
The wingspan is . The moth flies in one generation in late spring to early summer, e.g. from the end of May to June in Belgium and The Netherlands.
The caterpillars feed on Cynareae thistles – Greater Burdock ("Arctium lappa"), Cotton Thistle ("Onopordum acanthium"), and "Carduus" and "Cirsium" species.

Dollar for the Dead

Dollar for the Dead is a 1998 TNT western television film. Film directed and written by Gene Quintano and starring Emilio Estevez. It is the third western film which Estevez stars. Film also stars William Forsythe, Joaquim de Almeida, Jonathan Banks, Ed Lauter and Howie Long. Actor Jordi Mollà nominated for Fotogramas de Plata award.
"Dollar for the Dead" is often perceived as a tribute to the 1960s spaghetti westerns, with a liberal dose of modern Hong Kong film-making thrown in. Emilio Estevez portrays a "man with no name" role, stylistically akin to Clint Eastwood's 1960s westerns. The film also portrays an atmosphere similar to those of the 60s, with numerous visual and character references to Sergio Leone's Clint Eastwood films "Per un pugno di dollari", "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly", as well as non-Eastwood movies like "Once Upon a Time in the West", "The Wild Bunch" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", and so on.
Plot.
Lone super-quick gunslinger "nameless" Cowboy (Estevez) on the run from a rancher (Long) and his men out to kill him for killing his son. When former Confederate soldier (Forsythe) saw how can Cowboy defend himself, even dropping a drink, pulling and shooting a
guy, and catching his drink before it hits the floor. Cowboy gets mixed up with this soldier who has knowledge of hidden gold. So, Cowboy and Dooley, the Soldier tries to complete their map and find the gold because Dooley has only one part of the map. And also Col. Skinner (Redleg commander) on the tale of Dooley.
When Cowboy and Dooley free a man (Lauter) with part of the map to the gold, they then are also pursued by Spanish soldiers. It all leads to a small Mexican town terrorized by soldiers and led a by a good priest (De Almeida) who is another one which has knowledge of the hidden gold. Hidden gold

Jean Martianay

Jean Martianay (30 December 1647 – 16 June 1717) was a French Benedictine scholar of the Congregation of St. Maur. He is known for his edition of St. Jerome.
Life.
Martianay was born at Saint-Sever-Cap in the Diocese of Aire. He entered the Benedictines at an early age, and devoted himself to Biblical studies, Greek and Hebrew.
A circular letter of Martianay's is still extant, in which he begs the co-operation of Benedictine abbeys in the work of producing a critical and complete edition of Jerome's writings. He spent over thirty years in searching the libraries of France for information. 
Works.
Ziegelbauer says (op. cit. below, II, 58) that Martianay completed alone the edition of Jerome's works. The "Divina Bibliotheca" - the Hieronymian edition of the Vulgate - was in fact executed with the collaboration of Dom Antoine Pouget. 
Martianay's fame as editor of Jerome has somewhat eclipsed his wider repute as a Biblical scholar. He undertook the work on Jerome to meets the need of such an edition, for all who devoted themselves to Biblical research. 
He taught Scripture at Arles, Bordeaux, and Carcassonne. In addition, he published many critical works on Biblical questions; he wrote a treatise on inspiration against Richard Simon; also a vindication of the Hebrew text and of the chronology given in the Latin Vulgate. He died, aged 69, at Saint Germain-des-Prés, Paris.
Martianay also treated of: the history of the Biblical canon; the French versions of the "New Testament" in the "Tentamen Versionis": and wrote a treatise on "The Method of explaining Holy Scripture". In 1711 he published the life of a nun in the monastery of Beaume.
Martianay contributed to Biblical criticism by his edition of the "Divina Bibliotheca", or Jerome's text of the Vulgate. It attempted to reproduce the text, with scanty materials; he tells us at the close of his prolegomena what manuscripts he had at his disposal, six in all, the most important of which was the MS. Sangermanensis. Martianay published (1695) a separate collation of this text in his edition of the old Latin version of St. Matthew's Gospel and of the Epistle of St. James. This collation, reproduced by Bianchini in his "Evangelium Quadruplex", was considered faulty; a correction of it is in the first volume of Wordsworth and White, "Old Latin Biblical Texts". 
Ziegelbauer mentions also another work of Martianay, never printed, namely, an edition of the Vulgate with variant readings suggested by the Hebrew and Greek texts, and furnished with a series of references to the parallel passages. He also published the three psalters of St. Jerome; these appeared in French. Lastly should be mentioned his "New Testament in French" (2 vols., Paris, 1712).

Ministry of Women's Affairs (New Zealand)

The Ministry of Women’s Affairs is the Government’s source of advice on issues relevant to advancing the well-being of women. This encompasses women having real choices and using their strengths to maximise social and economic success. The Ministry's target areas are "greater economic independence, more women in leadership and increased safety from violence." 
Main Roles.
The Ministry’s main responsibilities are:
These three priorities feed into the Government’s objectives of lifting New Zealand's economic performance and building a safer New Zealand.
Greater economic independence
The Ministry's work in the 'greater economic independence' area focuses on "enabling women to make informed choices that lead to better lifetime incomes". Efforts in this area focus on the factors that can support women to more fully access economic opportunities and resources, such as:
There are two performance indicators to measure the impact of the Ministry's work in this area:
Women in Leadership
There is compelling evidence that greater gender diversity in governance correlates with better decision making and organisational performance, providing economic and other benefits. Having more women in leadership roles ensures a wider range of views for key decisions, and brings stronger connections with customers, stakeholders and investors. There is a need for a dual focus on demand for and supply of women board members.
The Ministry assists decision makers to achieve greater diversity in governance, in both the public and private sectors, by making the case for change and advising on effective strategies to realise change.
The Ministry also assists women to know about the type of governance roles that align with their skills and interests and how to pursue those roles. The Ministry provides women candidates for vacancies on state sector boards and, on request, for other entities.
The Ministry also operates a Nominations Service, which puts forward appropriate women candidates for a range of governance roles.
There are two performance indicators to measure the impact of the Ministry's work in this area:
Safety from Violence
Intimate partner violence and sexual violence are the most common forms of violence against women in New Zealand, and are of great cost to individuals, their families and the economy. Treasury has estimated that sexual offending costs the New Zealand economy $1.2 billion a year and is by far the most expensive crime per incident. The consequences of this violence can be long-lasting, with adverse effects on health, relationships, children's welfare and education, employment, productivity, earnings, and quality of life.
The Ministry works with other government departments on issues of intimate partner and sexual violence, with particular attention to minimising the incidence of revictimisation, and an increasing focus on prevention.
Its recent work has focused on:

Russia–Sudan relations

Russia–Sudan relations () refers to the bilateral relations between Russia and Sudan. Russia has an embassy in Khartoum and Sudan has an embassy in Moscow.
For decades, Russia and Sudan have maintained a strong economic and politically strategic partnership. Due to solidarity with both the United States and with the Soviet Union and with the allies of the two nations, Sudan declared neutrality and instead chose membership in the Non-Aligned Movement throughout the Cold War. Russo-Sudanese relations were minorly damaged when, in 1971 members of the Sudanese Communist Party attempted to assassinate then-president Gaafar Nimeiry, and Nimeiry pegged the blame on the USSR, thus enhancing Sudanese relations with the West, and were damaged again when Sudan supported the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan when the USSR invaded in 1979. Due to a common enemy, diplomatic cooperation between the two countries dramatically got back on track during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Vladimir Putin was elected the President, and then the Prime Minister of Russia, and along with Chinese leader Hu Jintao opposed UN Peacekeepers in Darfur. Russia strongly supports Sudan's territorial integrity and opposes the creation of an independent Darfurian state. Also, Russia is Sudan's strongest investment partner (in Europe) and political ally in Europe, and Russia has repeatedly and significantly regarded Sudan as an important global ally in the African continent. For decades there have been Sudanese college students studying in Russian universities.
During the 2008 attack on Omdurman and Khartoum, Justice and Equality Movement rebels from Darfur killed a Russian mercenary pilot by shooting his plane down when he tried to strafe them.
SIPRI reports that only 8 percent of Sudanese arms are Chinese, and that Russian arms actually make up the majority, at 87 percent. Russia is the major weapons supplier to the Sudan.
Amnesty International slammed Russia for breaking the UN arms embargo on Darfur, Russians sold weapons like Mi-24 helicopters, Anntonov 26 planes, Russian weapons sales to Sudan totaled 21 million dollars. It was reported these weapons were used to slaughter Darfur civilians. The report said Russia "cannot have been unaware of reports of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law by the Sudanese security forces, But they have nevertheless continued to allow military equipment to be sent to Sudan." Russia was reported to "have been or should have been aware, several types of military equipment, including aircraft, have been deployed by the Sudanese armed forces for direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks in Darfur". The Russian planes were disguised as UN Planes which violate the Geneva Conventions. The Janjaweed also used Russian small arms to murder and loot, these Russian weapons spread into neighboring Chad. In 2005 helicopters from Russia were sold to Sudan for 7 million pounds sterling. Photos show Russian helicopters in Darfur.

Lioré et Olivier LeO H-13

__NOTOC__
The Lioré et Olivier LéO H-13 was a French biplane two-engine flying boat of 1920s, built in passenger and military variants.
Development.
The LeO H-13 was constructed by Lioré et Olivier in Levallois-Perret factory, for an order of the French Aeronavale airlines. The prototype was flown in July 1922. From 1923 there were built 23 passenger aircraft LeO H-13A.
Next, there were developed military variants: reconnaissance-bomber LeO H-13B-3 and trainer LeO H-13E. They differed in fuselage configuration, because the H-13B-3 had an open cockpit for a pilot only behind a lower wing, while the H-13E had an open cockpit for a trainee and instructor seating side-by-side, in front of wings. Both had open machine gun nests in a fuselage nose and behind wings. The H-13E could be also used as a reconnaissance aircraft. From late 1923 there were built 20 H-13B-3 (nos. 1-20) and 10 H-13E (nos. 21-30).
Variants.
"Data from:" - Lioré et Olivier
Service.
Passenger H-13A were used over the Mediterranean Sea.
In the French Navy, H-13 were quickly withdrawn for training purpose, because of weak structure and low manufacturing quality.
In 1924-1925 two H-13B3 and two H-13E were sold to Poland and used in Naval Aviation Unit ("MDLot") in Puck from mid-1925. One of H-13E was used for a short time in a River Flotilla in Pińsk. The first H-13B-3 no. 1-1 was withdrawn in 1929, next two (nos. 1-2 and 1-3) in 1931, while the last H-13E, no. 1-4, crashed on 29 July 1931 over the land near Puck.
Description.
Two-engine biplane flying boat of wooden construction. Wooden framed fuselage, plywood covered, rectangular in cross-section, with a flat bottom with a single step. Two-spar rectangular wings, covered with plywood (in front) and canvas. A lower wing attached to the fuselage, an upper wing above it, mounted on struts, with two engines between wings, driving tractor propellers. Two floats under a lower wing. Conventional braced empennage. Two 150 hp radial engines Hispano-Suiza 8E.
Armament: two twin 7.7 mm Lewis machine guns and 4 bombs up to 25 kg below a lower wing.

Wawayanda Mountain is a ridge in the New York-New Jersey Highlands region of the Appalachian Mountains. The summit lies within Sussex County, New Jersey.
Geography.
Wawayanda Mountain stretches over of land, consisting of deciduous forest with areas of scrub-shrub and coniferous woods. 
Wawayanda Mountain and Pochuck Mountain to the west, form the borders of the Vernon Valley, an important farming and mining area of New Jersey drained by Pochuck Creek.
Appalachian Trail.
The Appalachian Trail runs over the top of the ridge within Wawayanda State Park.
Geology.
Wawayanda Mountain is part of the Reading Prong of the New England Uplands subprovince of the New England province of the Appalachian Highlands. The rocks that form Wawayanda Mountain are comprised from the same belt that make up nearby. This belt, i.e. the Reading Prong, consists of ancient crystalline metamorphic rocks. The New England province as a whole, along with the Blue Ridge province further south, are often together referred to as the Crystalline Appalachians. The Crystalline Appalachians extend as far north as the Green Mountains of Vermont and as far south as the Blue Ridge Mountains, although a portion of the belt remains below the Earth's surface through part of Pennsylvania. The Crystalline Appalachians are distinct from the parallel Sedimentary Appalachians which run from Georgia to New York. The nearby Kittatinny Mountains are representative of these sedimentary formations.
Wildlife.
Mammals inhabiting Wawayanda Mountain include black bear and white-tailed deer.

USS Chestnut (AN-11)

USS "Chestnut" (AN-11/YN-6) was an "Aloe"-class net laying ship which was assigned to serve the U.S. Navy during World War II with her protective anti-submarine nets.
Built in Portland, Oregon.
"Chestnut" (YN-6) was launched 15 March 1941 by Commercial Iron Works, Portland, Oregon; sponsored by Mrs. W. E. Meagher, and placed in service 25 July 1941, Lieutenant (junior grade) R. D. Abernathy, USNR, officer-in-charge.
World War II service.
Attached to the 11th Naval District, "Chestnut" tended nets and gave other harbor services at San Diego, California, until 24 June 1942. On 25 May 1942 she was placed in full commission and Lieutenant A. Schlott, USNR, her officer-in-charge, became commanding officer.
Steaming by way of Hawaii and Samoa, "Chestnut" arrived at Efate, New Hebrides, 26 February 1943.

1908 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia

The 1908 British Isles tour to New Zealand and Australia was the seventh tour by a British Isles team and the fourth to New Zealand and Australia. The tour is often referred to as the "Anglo-Welsh Tour" as only English and Welsh players were selected due to the Irish and Scottish Rugby Unions not participating. It is retrospectively classed as one of the British Lions tours, as the Lions naming convention was not adopted until 1950.
Led by Arthur 'Boxer' Harding and managed by George Harnett the tour took in 26 matches, 9 in Australia and 17 in New Zealand. Of the 26 games, 23 were against club or invitational teams and three were test matches against the All Blacks. The Lions lost two and drew one match against the All Blacks.
The tour was not received well in Wales, as the Welsh players selected were chosen exclusively from those players from a well educated and professional class background. The selection was in fact addressed by the Welsh Rugby Union who stated that when a British Isles team was mooted for a South Africa tour in 1910, that the players should be chosen '...irrespective of the social position of the players.'

Petr Nečas

Petr Nečas (born 19 November 1964; ) is a former Prime Minister of the Czech Republic and leader of the Civic Democratic Party. He was sworn into office on 28 June 2010.
He resigned on 17 June 2013, in the aftermath of a police investigation in which his chief of staff and alleged mistress Jana Nagyová were arrested. Jana Nagyová herself was released from custody on 19 July 2013.
Private life and education.
Nečas was born in Uherské Hradiště, Czech Republic, on 19 November 1964. He attended gymnasium in Uherské Hradiště from 1979 to 1983. He graduated from the faculty of science at the University of J.E. Purkyně in Brno in 1988.
Nečas met his future wife, Radka Nečasová, at school when he was 18. In 2013, he filed for divorce and not long after married his former chief of staff, Jana Nagyová.
Career.
Peter Nečas studied plasma physics. Before he was elected to the Czech Parliament he worked as research and development engineer in the semiconductor industry, dealing with plasma processes. From 1988 to 1992, he worked as developer for Tesla Rožnov. He became a member of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in 1991 and was named deputy defence minister in 1995. One year later, he was elected member of the Chamber of Deputies. From 4 September 2006 to 8 May 2009, Nečas was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs.
In March 2010, he replaced Mirek Topolánek as leader of the party. The Civic Democratic Party won second place in the 2010 Czech legislative election and shortly after that Nečas announced his intention to stand for the post of party chairman.
In 2011 Nečas supported European organizations signing an agreement on the establishment of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience for studies on the totalitarian past. On this occasion, Nečas highlighted that all four countries of the Visegrad Group have gone through two totalitarian regimes in their modern history. “This must not be forgotten, because it was a period of fight for freedom,” said Petr Nečas. He added: “Our nations deserve the truth about their past and I believe that the establishment of this Platform will help to find the truth about this history.”
In 2012 Prime Minister Petr Nečas urged all Czechs to avoid drinking "any alcohol whose origin is uncertain" due to a fatal methanol poisoning affair in the Czech Republic which caused more than 40 casualties, including several cases of people being blinded.
In 2013 Nečas supported Israel on the occasion of the Czech Republic's voting at the United Nations. Due to an historical affinity, Nečas claimed, "We've got a special feeling for Israel's situation—that of a small nation surrounded by enemies." 
In June 2013, the Police "Unit for Combating Organized Crime" and the "Chief Public Prosecutor's Office" in Olomouc organized a raid against organized crime. It involved several high-ranking state officials and politicians, including Jana Nagyova, the then chief of staff of Prime Minister Nečas. Initially Nečas refused to resign but he finally did so on 17 June. In February 2014, the police charged him with bribery.

Tropical rainforest climate

Description.
Tropical rainforests are a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season – all months have an average precipitation value of at least 60 mm. Tropical rainforest climates have no pronounced summer or winter; it is typically hot and wet throughout the year and rainfall is both heavy and frequent. One day in an equatorial climate can be very similar to the next, while the change in temperature between day and night may be larger than the average change in temperature along the year.
Distribution.
Some of the places that have this climate are indeed uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year (e.g., the northwest Pacific coast of South and Central America, from Ecuador to Costa Rica, see for instance, Andagoya, Colombia), but in many cases the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly driest (as at Palembang, Indonesia) or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain (as at Sitiawan, Malaysia).
Additionally, while tropical rainforest climates are typically located near the equator (hence the alternate name “equatorial climate”), there are a number of instances where the climate is found some distance away from the equator. For instance, Santos, Brazil and Fort Lauderdale, USA are not only far removed from the equator, but are actually located just outside the tropics. Yet both of these cities feature a tropical rainforest climate, albeit with noticeably cooler and warmer periods of the year.

Order to cash

"Order to cash" (O2C or OTC) normally refers to the business process for receiving and processing customer sales. It follows "Opportunity to Order" and covers business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) sales. The term is most prominent in the design and improvement of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems such as SAP and Oracle.
In many business models a contractual relationship is established first via a Contract or Subscription. Orders are then received via different sales channels, such as phone, fax, email, internet or sales person. The contractual relationship is confirmed and the Orders are fulfilled through shipping and logistics. On completion of key events an invoice is generated and booked as Sales (subject to "Revenue Recognition" requirements). If payment has not already been received, the debt is recorded and pursued through dunning cycles until the funds are received. Order to Cash is completed by the Customer Care process (enquiries, requests and complaints).
If we consider the ERP system flow, this is typically categorized into the following eight sub-processes:

Rob Dawber

Robert "Rob" Dawber (8 January 1956 – 20 February 2001) was a British railwayman turned writer whose script for the film "The Navigators" was commissioned by director Ken Loach and shot in Sheffield, where Dawber lived. He was a long-standing member of the Trotskyist group the Alliance for Workers' Liberty.
Biography.
Background.
Dawber grew up in Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire and, having studied Politics and English at Leicester University, decided to pursue a career on the railways.
He had strong political beliefs, and during his time as a railwayman he "became a branch secretary for the National Union of Railwaymen, and wrote for "Socialist Organiser" and "Off The Rails", a bulletin for rail workers. His Fat Controller column mercilessly lampooned the rail managers who squandered the opportunities of the nationalised industries".
Following privatisation of the railways from 1994, Dawber was made redundant and he took the decision to begin writing a film script. After sending his work to Ken Loach, his script about the breakup of the nationalised railways through privatisation was commissioned.
Illness and death.
One week after this news, Rob discovered he was suffering from mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer caused by handling asbestos during the course of his work on the railway.
Rob searched the world for therapies and treatments, but died on 20 February 2001 at the age of 45. He saw "The Navigators" completed but did not live to see its release.
Ken Loach, in his "Guardian" obituary of Rob Dawber, wrote that "Working people have lost a champion".

Battle of Huaqui

The Battle of Huaqui (in some sources also called Guaqui, Yuraicoragua or Battle of Desaguadero), was a battle between the Primera Junta's (Buenos Aires) revolutionary troops and the royalist troops of the Viceroyalty of Peru on the border between Upper Peru, (present-day Bolivia), and the Viceroyalty of Peru on June 20, 1811.
Prelude.
The army commanded by Juan José Castelli and Antonio González Balcarce had their first encounter with the royalists under the command of General José Manuel de Goyeneche in October 1810. The royalist army did not press their advantage and did not pursue, and while retreating to the South, they had another encounter which they lost at Suipacha.
The successful advance of the Primera Junta's troops continued to the North of Upper Peru and on June 20, 1811 they met again near the Desaguadero River where battle ensued.
Battle progress.
On the morning of June 19, the revolutionary army had placed their troops in Huaqui, Caza and Machaca and built a temporary bridge over the Desaguadero River moving 1,200 troops across. The aim was to distract Goyeneche's troops on their front and right flank while surrounding the royalists on their rear through the lines established by this new bridge.
General Goyeneche decided to effect a direct attack with his full force. At three in the morning of June 20 he ordered colonels Juan Ramírez and Pablo Astete, lieutenant colonels Luis Astete and Mariano Lechuga (with 350 cavalry and four cannons) to attack Caza, near the road to Machaca and communication to Huaqui, while he marched towards Huaqui with colonels Francisco Picoaga and Fermín Piérola commanding 300 cavalry, 40 guardsmen and 6 pieces of artillery.
At dawn the heights on the hills the royalist troops needed to take were already teeming with revolutionary troops, cavalry and fusiliers who started shooting the Spaniards along with grenades and slingshots. The royalists responded and within a few hours made the revolutionaries retreat.
When the independentist troops heard of Goyeneche's advance towards Huaqui, Castelli, Balcarce and Montes de Oca left the town with 15 artillery pieces and 2,000 men and took a strong position on the road to Huaqui between a small lake and the hills behind.
Goyeneche ordered an advance under enemy fire while colonel Picoaga's battalion covered them with return fire. The independentist troops, recognizing General Goyeneche, directed their fire towards him, and he ordered one of his aides to transmit the order to attack with his right flank, also covering the road with Piérola's battalion and detached three companies to advance on the front while he and the rest of his troops attacked through the left. 
The Argentine cavalry tried to stop the push but was overrun and fled, along with the whole rebel army towards Huaqui. Goyeneche ordered pursuit and subsequently captured the town. Colonel Ramírez soon after sent a messenger informing them of victory at Caza.
The battle ended with the Argentine troops in full retreat, with more than 1000 men lost and abandoning most of their artillery. In full run they took refuge in Potosí and later on farther south in Jujuy.
Consequences.
At the same time, on June 20, 1811 a revolution that was previously prepared, started in Perú. Their leader Francisco Antonio De Zela had agreed with the Argentine troops that while he started the revolution in Tacna, the Argentine army would advance towards Peru to initiate the liberation campaign on that country, but the defeat at Huaqui stopped the plans on Peruvian territory.
The bad impression that this defeat caused in Buenos Aires, where they had lost their guns, resulted in González Balcarce and Castelli being relieved of their commands and court-martialed. The defeat also caused a cease-fire of the fight in Montevideo due to the concern in Buenos Aires of being attacked from two fronts at the same time.
The independentist's defeat at Huaqui was of such magnitude that the weakness created in the north after the battle forced them to name General Belgrano to take control of the Army of the North and try to re-establish discipline, train the troops and wait for new armament. It forced him to take extreme measures and mobilize Northern Argentina's population in Jujuy Province towards the south before the imminent Spanish offensive. This episode is known in history as the Jujuy Exodus ("Spanish:Éxodo Jujeño").

Pensacola Streetcar Strike of 1908

A strike of streetcar operators took place in Pensacola, Florida from April 5 to May 13, 1908. It was staged by employees of the Pensacola Electric Company over a company rule requiring workers whom the company had suspended for whatever reason to report to the company's car barn thrice daily for a roll call. During the 39-day strike, open violence erupted in Pensacola's streets, resulting in at least one death, after which martial law was declared and the state militia was sent to provide security to the company strikebreakers.

Its personalities included the late Madge Cooper Guthery (starting in 1941), and Charlie Evers (starting in the late 1950s) who were daily listening institutions throughout Marion, Ohio until they retired.
In October 2010 the AM station scored a major get as on air personality Scott Spears obtained the first interview with former "Dean of the White House Press Corps" Helen Thomas after her retirement in June 2010. Spears received an Associated Press Award in 2011 for this interview
In the 1970s, WMRN's owners launched an FM sister station WMRN-FM which played "easy listening music" until its format was converted to Country & Western in the in 1980s. Clear Channel Communications separated the AM operations from the FM station, and then sold WMRN-AM to its current owner. The station's "Tradio" program (a item "swap" show where residents offer up goods for sale or trade) remains popular with local residents.

Marisa Merlini

Marisa Merlini (6 August 1923 – 27 July 2008) was an Italian character actress active in Italy's post-World War II cinema. Merlini appreared in over fifty films during her career, which spanned from World War II to 2005. She was, perhaps, best known for her role in the 1953 film "Pane, Amore e Fantasia", directed by Luigi Comencini, in which she portrayed Annarella, a village midwife who marries the local police marshall, played by actor Vittorio De Sica.
A native of Rome, where she was born on 6 August 1923, Merlini was well known for playing the "romana verace", or "born-and-bred Roman" characters. Merlini also appeared in several high profile comedic films alongside Italian actor, Totò, as well as the 1960 film "Il Vigile" with actor Alberto Sordi. Additionally, Merlini appeared in a number of films opposite her real life friend, Italian actress Anna Magnani.
Merlini's awards included the Nastro d'Argento (Silver Ribbon), a film critics' award in 1957 for portraying a tourist in the 1956 Antonio Racioppi directed film, "Tempo di Villeggiatura".
Merlini's last appearance on screen came in the 2005 film, "La Seconda Notte di Nozze", which was directed by Pupi Avati.
Marisa Merlini died in Rome, Italy, on 27 July 2008, at the age of 83. Director Pupi Avati, who directed Merlini's final 2005 film, "La Seconda Notte di Nozze", paid tribute to Merlini saying, ""Marisa brought to the set the experience of somebody who had taken part in the golden years of Italian cinema, but she was down-to-earth both in front of and behind the camera..."Working with her was an honour and a fantastic experience."

The Day That Never Comes

"The Day That Never Comes" is a song by heavy metal band Metallica, and the lead single from their ninth studio album, "Death Magnetic". The song was released to the radio and for digital download on August 21, 2008.
The working title of the song was "Casper", as shown in the "Mission: Metallica" videos and in "Demo Magnetic".
Composition.
Like previous ballads and downbeat songs by Metallica, it is the fourth track of the album. "Rock Sound" has also compared the song to the likes of Thin Lizzy. The intro starts out with clean guitars that carry into the verses, while the choruses are backed with heavily distorted guitars. The bridge speeds up gradually and eventually leads into fast paced harmony between the guitars and a long guitar solo by Hammett, a build-up comparable to that of "One", "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" and "Fade to Black". The ending of the song, like the previously mentioned ballads, is purely instrumental, featuring numerous solos and chord progressions.
Music video.
A music video for the song was filmed in the desert outside Los Angeles, California on July 31, 2008, directed by Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg. It was premiered on the band's official page at midnight on September 1, 2008.
The video depicts two Marines riding a HMMWV in a desert and getting hit by an explosion. After they take cover and look for the attacker, one of them reveals that he suffered a wound. The other Marine provides first aid and calls for help, and while he's eventually medevaced by a helicopter, it is implied that he fainted. The video then forwards to another situation involving the remaining Marine in another group riding a HMMWV and getting stopped in the road by a car and a civilian in front of it holding a jumper cable in the air. The group, suspecting it might be an ambush, circles around the car and keeps the man at gunpoint, only to find a woman in chador in the back seat. They order her out of the car, but she approaches the protagonist, who keeps holding her at gunpoint. The video then climaxes when the Marines nervously look at each other, fearing that she might be a suicide bomber, but eventually the Marine lowers his weapon and signals to the rest to do the same. The Marines help the man to push start the car, and the protagonist remains looking at the sky. Scenes of the band performing in the desert are interspersed within the video.
Concepts.
On , in an MTV interview, the song lyrics were said to tackle the subject of forgiveness and resentment. The band's drummer Lars Ulrich claimed that the lyrics were inspired by a father-son relationship. The content of the video itself is of a different theme or setting that what the lyrics themselves were written about, a second interpretation. The video is said to be in a war background in comparison to the "One" video, but will not make any modern day references as in the war in Iraq and the Middle East (although the video depicts images of Middle East war in present day, they do not imply any political statement).
Frontman James Hetfield spoke on the lyrics of the song and also the radical difference of the song lyrics and vision intended to the music video.
Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and Ulrich also commented by stating ultimately, the concept of the video deals with humanity and the relationships between human beings and how your basic sense of humanity can override any sort of politicized situation.
Chart performance.
The song debuted and peaked on "Billboards Hot 100 at #31, giving the band their seventh top forty Hot 100 hit. It is also the band's highest charting single on the Hot 100 since 1997's "The Memory Remains", which peaked at #28. With less than four days of airplay, "The Day That Never Comes" debuted at #7 on "Billboard"s Mainstream Rock Chart, giving Metallica their sixteenth top ten hit on the chart. The next week it rose to #2 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. In its third week, it reached number one on the chart, the band's sixth song to top the chart, and first since 2000's "I Disappear". It also debuted at #25 on Modern Rock Tracks, and has so far peaked at #5, giving the band their first top five ever on that chart. It debuted in the top ten on the Canadian Hot 100, at #9.
"The Day That Never Comes" has spent a total of nine weeks at #1 on Hot Mainstream Rock Chart with its seven consecutive weeks at the top spot and two consecutive weeks prior.
The song has been very successful internationally as well. On August 24, 2008, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at #36 and peaked at #19. In Ireland it has so far reached #14. On the Australian ARIA Charts, the song has also reached the top twenty, at #18. It has reached the top ten in New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden.
It was voted in at #88 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2008 which is Australia's largest annual music poll. It was their only track off Death Magnetic to poll in the list.

Rotation operator (vector space)

This article derives the main properties of rotations in 3-dimensional space.
The three Euler rotations are one way to bring a rigid body to any desired orientation by sequentially making rotations about axis' fixed relative to the object. However, this can also be achieved with one single rotation (Euler's rotation theorem). Using the concepts of linear algebra it is shown how this single 
rotation can be performed.
Mathematical formulation.
Let
be a coordinate system fixed in the body that through a change in orientation is brought to the new directions
Any vector
rotating with the body is then brought to the new direction
i.e. this is a linear operator
The matrix of this operator relative to the coordinate system
is 
As 
or equivalently in matrix notation
the matrix is orthogonal and as a "right hand" base vector system is re-orientated into another "right hand" system the determinant of this matrix has the value 1.
Rotation around an axis.
Let 
be an orthogonal positively oriented base vector system in formula_10.
The linear operator
"Rotation with the angle formula_11 around the axis defined by formula_12"
has the matrix representation
relative to this basevector system. 
This then means that a vector
is rotated to the vector
by the linear operator. 
The determinant of this matrix is
and the characteristic polynomial is
The matrix is symmetric if and only if formula_18, i.e. for formula_19
and for formula_20.
The case formula_19 is the trivial case of an identity operator.
For the case formula_20 the characteristic polynomial is
i.e. the rotation operator has the eigenvalues
The eigenspace corresponding to formula_25 is all vectors on the rotation axis, i.e. all vectors
The eigenspace corresponding to formula_27 consists of all vectors orthogonal to the rotation axis, i.e. all vectors
For all other values of formula_11 the matrix is un-symmetric and as formula_30 there is
only the eigenvalue formula_25 with the one-dimensional eigenspace of the vectors on the rotation axis:
The rotation matrix by angle formula_11 around a general axis of rotation 
formula_34
is given by Rodrigues' rotation formula.
where formula_36 is the identity matrix and formula_37 is the dual 2-form of formula_38 or 
Note that formula_40 satisfies formula_41 for all formula_42.
The general case.
The operator
"Rotation with the angle formula_11 around a specified axis"
discussed above is an orthogonal mapping and its matrix relative to any base vector system is therefore an 
orthogonal matrix . Furthermore its determinant has the value 1.
A non-trivial fact is the opposite, i.e. that for any orthogonal linear mapping in formula_10 having 
determinant = 1 there exist base vectors
such that the matrix takes the "canonical form"
for some value of formula_11. 
In fact, if a linear operator has the orthogonal matrix
relative some base vector system
and this matrix is symmetric, the "Symmetric operator theorem" valid in formula_50 (any dimension) applies saying
that it has "n" orthogonal eigenvectors. This means for the 3-dimensional case that there exists a coordinate system
such that the matrix takes the form
As it is an orthogonal matrix these diagonal elements formula_53 are either 1 or −1. As the determinant is 1 these elements 
are either all 1 or one of the elements is 1 and the other two are −1.
In the first case it is the trivial identity operator corresponding
to formula_19. 
In the second case it has the form
if the basevectors are numbered such that the one with eigenvalue 1 has index 3. This matrix is then of the desired form for formula_20.
If the matrix is un-symmetric, the vector
where
is non-zero. This vector is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 
Setting 
and selecting any two orthogonal unit vectors in the plane orthogonal to formula_12:
such that 
form a positively oriented triple, the operator takes the desired form with
The expressions above are in fact valid also for the case of a symmetric
rotation operator corresponding to a rotation with formula_68 
or formula_69. But the difference is that for formula_69
the vector 
is zero and of no use for finding the eigenspace of eigenvalue 1, i.e. the
rotation axis.
Defining formula_72 as formula_73 the matrix for the
rotation operator is
and that the fourth component is the scalar
As the angle formula_11 defined from the canonical form is in the interval 
one would normally have that formula_78. But a "dual" representation of a rotation with quaternions
is used, i.e. 
and 
are two alternative representations of one and the same rotation.
The entities formula_81 are defined from the quaternions by
Using quaternions the matrix of the rotation operator is
Numerical example.
Consider the reorientation corresponding to the Euler angles
formula_87
relative a given base vector system
Corresponding matrix relative to this base vector system is (see Euler angles#Matrix orientation)
and the quaternion is
The canonical form of this operator
with formula_92 is obtained with
The quaternion relative to this new system is then
Instead of making the three Euler rotations 
the same orientation can be reached with one single rotation of size formula_96 around formula_12

Vuelta a España records and statistics

The Vuelta a España is an important cycling race (one of the grand tours). The first Vuelta a España was in 1935. As the Vuelta a España is a stage race, a classification based on times is calculated after every stage. The cyclist with the lowest time after a stage is the leader of the general classification after that stage. A jersey is given to that cyclist, which the cyclist wears during the next stage. From 1999 to 2009, this jersey had a golden color and was named the golden jersey. From 2010 onwards, the leader's jersey was red. It has also been black and white at different points in the Vuelta's history.
Although the leader of the classification after a stage gets the leader's jersey, he is not considered the winner of that jersey, only the wearer. Only after the final stage, the wearer of the leader's jersey is considered the winner, and therefore the winner of the Vuelta a España.
Since the first Vuelta a España in 1935, there have been 1,323 stages, up to and including the 2012 Vuelta a España. The race leader following each stage has been awarded a leader's jersey.
Although the number of stages is 1,323, there have been 1,324 leader's jerseys awarded, because after the first stage of the 1948 Vuelta a España, Bernardo Ruiz and Julián Berrendero shared the lead and both received the leader's jersey. As of 2013, 1,345 leader's jerseys have been awarded in the Vuelta a España to 203 different riders.
Individual records.
Key:
In previous Vueltas a España, sometimes a stage was split in two. On such occasions, only the cyclist leading at the end of the day is counted. The "Leader's jerseys" column gives the number of days that the cyclist "wore" the leader's jersey, the "Vuelta wins" column gives the number of times that the cyclist "won" the Vuelta. The next three columns indicate the number of times the rider won the points classification, the mountains classification, and the years in which the rider lead the general classification, with bold years indicating an overall Vuelta win.
For example: Alex Zülle has spent 48 days in the leader's jersey, and won the overall classification two times. He wore the leader's jersey in the Vueltas of 1993, 1996, 1997 and 2000, of which he won the 1996 and 1997 Vueltas.
Per country.
The leader's jersey has been awarded to 19 different countries since 1935. In the table below, "Jerseys" indicates the number of leader's jerseys that were given to cyclists of each country. "Vuelta wins" stands for the number of Vuelta wins by cyclists of that country, "Points" for the number of times the points classification was won by a cyclist of that country and "KoM" for the number of times the mountains classification was won by a cyclist of that country. "Combo'" shows the winners of the combination classification, This classification is calculated by adding the numeral ranks of each cyclist in the general, points, and mountains classifications (a rider must have a score in all). 
The "Most recent" column shows the cyclist of the country that wore the leader's jersey most recently. The "Different holders" column gives the number of different cyclists of the country that wore the leader's jersey.

University College Boat Club (Oxford)

University College Boat Club (commonly abbreviated to UCBC) is the rowing club for all members of University College, Oxford ("Univ"). UCBC has had a recent run of successes, notably in the Women's divisions with the Women's 1st VIII winning Blades in Torpids 2011 and the 2nd VIII winning Blades in Torpids 2012. The men's side is also highly successful and currently fourth on the river in Summer Eights.
History.
The idea of inter collegiate racing was pioneered by Brasenose College Boat Club and Jesus College Boat Club in 1815. In 1827, it was decided to form a University College eight. The origins of UCBC can be attributed to one student, William Roper, who supervised the raising of £100 to build a boat and select a crew. Whilst the crew did not compete in 1829 or 1832-8 it has done so almost continuously until the present day, first going Head of the River in 1841. By the mid-1850s the Boat Club was enjoying a centrality to college life that it has not lost. The mid nineteenth century was a period of great success for UCBC being Head of the River in 1869–71, 1874–5 and 1877–8. One undergraduate Charles Cree recorded the celebrations in 1871:
Univ won the headship in 1914, the college now being in possession of an original commemorative blade from that time. Sadly, many of that crew did not live to see the end of the Great War. Stephen Hawking was a member of the club in the 1960s, coxing the Men's Second VIII. The club features on the front cover of his autobiography, My Brief History
Univ was last Eights Head of the River from 1990 to 1991.
Recent Results.
In Summer Eights, the men's 1st boat has climbed steadily over the past decade from the middle of Division II. As of 2013, the 1st Eight is fourth on the river, the highest college with the exception of those (Oriel, Pembroke and Christ Church) which regularly attract Oxford Blue rowers. The women's 1st Eight, meanwhile, achieved Blades in 2010 and 2011, and is now in the middle of Division I. The club is also highly successful lower-down the divisions, qualifying more boats for Eights 2012 than any other college.
The club's recent record in Torpids is less successful, with the Men's 1st Torpid currently towards the bottom of Division II. The Women's 1st Torpid has been marginally stronger recently, achieving Blades in 2010 and 2011.
Novice training is also strong, with large numbers of boats entered every year for Nepthys Regatta and Christ Church Regatta. Indeed, the former was won in 2012 by the Men's Novice A crew.
The Boathouse.
UCBC's boathouse has become an iconic and instantly recognisable architectural statement in and around Oxford. The original 19th century boathouse, designed by John Oldrid Scott, succumbed to arson in 1999. After eight years, a new boathouse was finished, designed by Belsize Architects. The Boathouse has been awarded a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) prize. The £2.7million structure has enjoyed a very favourable reception in the architectural world. Yuli Toh's article describes the structure as not just a boathouse, but "a grandstand of the first order" arguing that it represents a new age in rowing.
Saturday of Eights’ Week 2007 saw the opening of the new boathouse by Colin Moynihan (1974) who coxed the College and the University, won a silver medal at the Moscow Olympics in 1980, gained a boxing Blue, later became Minister of Sport, and is now Chairman of the British Olympic Association. The ceremony also marked the dedication of the Coleman Viewing Terrace by Jimmy Coleman (1963) and Jamie Coleman (1994); it is named for their generous gift.
Equipment.
UCBC benefits from having one of the most modern fleets on the Isis.
The men's side of the boat club uses the following shells:
The women's side of the Boat Club uses the following shells:
The Erg Room is equipped with 8 Model D Concept2 Ergs and stretching/exercise mats, along with changing rooms for crews.
Social events.
UCBC organises several social events per term, ranging from crew dates and pub crawls through to formal dinners, held to celebrate both Torpids and Eights.
Dinosaurs and Cassandrians.
Univ members who have rowed or coxed all four days of Summer Eights as part of the Men's 1st VIII are entitled to become a member of the Dinosaurs society. Members who have rowed or coxed all four days of Summer Eights as part of the Women's 1st VIII are entitled to become a member of the Cassandrians society. An annual Dinosars and Cassandrians dinner is held (usually in January) where many Old Members return to the college to celebrate Univ rowing with current members. A related club is the Univ Dinosaurs and Cassandrians Ironman Triathlon Club (UDCITC).

Ernest Suckling

Ernest Suckling (27 March 1890—24 February 1962) was an English cricketer who played five first-class matches for Warwickshire and Worcestershire in the years after the First World War, having played Second XI cricket for Warwickshire as long ago as 1910.
Suckling made his debut for Warwickshire against Yorkshire at Edgbaston in June 1919; he scored 2 and 4 and bowled three wicketless overs.
He also appeared for his county in a non-Championship game against Worcestershire in August, when he made 39 from number ten in the order in a drawn match.
He did not appear at first-class level again until 1923, when he made the first of his three appearances for Worcestershire: two that season and one in 1924. On his Worcestershire debut, against Lancashire, he took 4-71, the only first-class wickets of his career, including those of Test players Jack Sharp and Cecil Parkin.
In Suckling's next game, against Kent at Dudley, he produced his only half-century, making 58.
He ended his first-class career on a low note versus Gloucestershire: after 0* in the first innings, he was dismissed for 0 by Percy Mills.
Suckling played in the Lancashire League as the club professional for Enfield Cricket Club in 1925.

Bristol Bullpup

__NOTOC__
The Bristol Type 107 Bullpup was a British fighter aircraft built in the 1920s. It was not selected for squadron service and only the single prototype was built
Background.
The design of the Bullpup was an outcome of a series of design studies for fighter undertaken by Frank Barnwell during the 1920s. In 1924 Barnwell had started work on a fighter powered by the Rolls-Royce Falcon to meet the requirements of specification F.17/24. This project was shelved since Bristol preferred to use their own engine designs, but was revived in 1926 when Barnwell started work on a design, designated the Bristol 102, to meet either F.9/26 for a day and night fighter or N.21/26 for a shipborne fighter. A subsequent proposal, designated Type 105 was for another aircraft to meet F.9/26 powered by the Mercury engine then under development at Bristol. These proposals looked enough for a pair of mock-ups to be constructed for inspection by the Air Ministry in February 1927. The two aircraft were similar in design, the interceptor to specification F.17/24 design being slightly smaller and lighter and not equipped with radio. As a result Bristol were asked to revise the design so that it met a later interceptor specification, F.20/27. Subsequently a prototype was ordered for evaluation, but the other design did not gain official backing. Nevertheless Bristol considered it promising enough to build a prototype to be entered for the F.9/26 trials as a private venture, powered by a Bristol Jupiter because the supply of Mercurys was expected to be limited. This became the Bristol Bulldog
Design and development.
The Type 107 was an unequal span single bay biplane powered by a 480 hp (360 kW) Bristol Mercury air-cooled radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller. The structure was all-metal with a fabric covering, using members built up from rolled high-tensile steel strips riveted together. In order to optimise the pilot's field of view there was large semi-circular cutout in the trailing edge of the upper wing and the inboard section of the lower was of reduced chord. Frise ailerons were fitted to the top wing only. It was armed with a pair of 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis guns mounted either side of the cockpit. 
The prototype first flew on 28 April 1928, powered by a Bristol Jupiter since a flight-ready Mercury was not yet available, and the aircraft was not delivered to Martlesham Heath for evaluation until March 1929. The Bullpup prototype was subsequently fitted with a Jupiter F type head with twin compensator rods for the penthouse heads. Trials with this engine were carried out at Martlesham in 1929. 
Operational history.
Performance at the F.20/27 competition held in 1929 was respectable but in the event none of the competitors was to enter service, the requirement eventually being met by the Hawker Fury, a Rolls-Royce Kestrel engined development of the Hawker F.20/27 contender. The prototype was used as an engine test aircraft until it was scrapped in 1935 at the end of the Bristol Aquila development programme.

79th Street Boat Basin

The 79th Street Boat Basin is a marina located in the Hudson River on the Upper West Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan, on Riverside Park at the foot of West 79th Street. Maintained and operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, it is the only facility in the city that allows year-round residency in boats.
History.
The boat basin, first proposed in 1924, was constructed in 1937, during the tenure of Robert Moses as Parks Commissioner, to offer a place for boats to dock during the summer. It was built as part of a project to cover over the tracks of the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line which also included a grand architectural multi-level entry and exit from the Henry Hudson Parkway, all under the name of the "79th Street Grade Crossing Elimination Structure". The multi-level structure was designed by Gilmore David Clarke. The Works Projects Administration provided $5.1 million for the project, which created the Freedom Tunnel, an underground parking garage, a restaurant, and the marina. By the 1960s, though the restaurant was long gone, the majority of slips were occupied by year-round boaters.
In 1979, the city sought to cancel a 1977 concession agreement with Nichols Yacht Yards to operate the marina, claiming that Nichols had underreported revenue and had acted as an "absentee slumlord". Boat owners would manage the marina until a suitable operator would be found. Though Nichols obtained an injunction blocking the dismissal in December 1979, the firm's operation of the facility ended in 1982, with Nichols having spent $250,000 in legal fees to battle the city and counter a rent strike by boat owners.
In 1992, a five-year agreement was signed with boaters and the city, tying increases of nearly 25% in docking fees to improvements in facilities at the marina, such as new docks and electrical lines. By 1996, year-round residents had complained that the 18-month long project, implemented at a cost of $1.4 million, had been done in shoddy fashion.
The city stopped issuing new year-round permits in 1994, seeking to make space available for seasonal boaters among the basin's 116 slips. After complaints were received, the Parks Department agreed to an increase to 52 year-round spots, which start at a yearly fee of $5,000, based on the size of the boat. By May 2009, the Department will require that all boats be seaworthy. As of February 2008, there were 19 boats that were considered unseaworthy and that would need to made operational "in case of an emergency evacuation". .
Year-round residents have included "Mad Magazine" writer Dick DeBartolo who uses a boat as his office. Malcolm Forbes, Aristotle Onassis, Mario Puzo and Frank Sinatra have all used the basin to moor their boats. In the 1960s, Roy Cohn docked his yacht here, and used it to entertain the city's political leaders.
Services.
The Boat Basin is also used as a launch site for kayaks, canoes and sailboats. The Hudson River sloop "Clearwater" often docks here, as part of its mission of informing the public about environmental and pollution issues in the Hudson River.
The granite and fieldstone open rotunda surrounded by a vaulted Guastavino tiled arcade overlooks the marina, and is the site of the open-air O’Neals’ West 79th Street Boat Basin Café.
As of May 2008, seasonal docking fees are $108 per linear foot (or a minimum of $2,700) for the summer (May 1 to October 31) and $88 per linear foot (or a minimum of $2,200) during the winter
(November 1 to April 30). Total dock fee revenue was over $240,000 in 2007, with more revenue taken in from the higher fees paid for part-time boaters. As of February 2008, there was a waiting list of 450 boaters seeking part-time docking privileges during the summer.
A boat pump-out system connects directly to boats to allow for sewage disposal. Along with a fresh-water line system, the service is provided at no additional cost by the Parks Department. All other services — including electricity, telephone, television and Internet access — must be paid for by boat owners, individually.
Filming.
The Boat Basin has been a popular filming location. The Parks Department's web page for the basin even lists details for obtaining film permits among things to do at the marina. The 1998 film "You've Got Mail" has Tom Hanks and his relatives living on yachts in the basin.

Chief Justice of Sri Lanka

The Chief Justice of Sri Lanka is the head of the judicial system of Sri Lanka and is the chief judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. The Chief Justice is one of ten Supreme Court justices; the other nine are the Puisne Justices of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. The post was created in 1801.
The Chief Justice is appointed by the President of Sri Lanka with the nomination of the Parliamentary Council. The Chief Justice, The Justices of the Supreme Court and The Justices of the Court of Appeal are addressed as "Your Lordship" and receives the title "The Honourable Justice". 
The first Chief Justice was Codrington Edmund Carrington. The 44th and current Chief Justice is Mohan Peiris.
History.
The office of Chief Justice traces its origins back with the founding the Royal Charter of Justice of 1801 by the British. With the establishment of the Supreme Court it was to consist of one principal Judge who shall be called "The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature in the Island of Ceylon" and One other Judge, who was to be called "The Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature in the Island of Ceylon". The charter required the Chief Justice and Puisne Justice to have not less than Five Years experience as Barristers, in England or Ireland to be named and appointed.
The post was first held by Codrington Edmund Carrington. 
Current Chief Justice.
The current Chief Justice is The Honourable Justice Mohan Peiris PC. He was appointed on 15 January 2013 following the controversial Impeachment of Shirani Bandaranayake, the first woman to hold the position. Peiris was elevated by President Mahinda Rajapaksa with the approval of the Parliamentary Council. Peiris' appointment drew some criticism. Peiris is considered to be an ally of President Rajapaksa and his appointment was seen by critics as further consolidation of power by the president and his family. Prior to his appointment he was Chairman of Seylan Bank, Senior Legal Officer to the Cabinet and held the post of Attorney General. Peiris was officially inaugurated as Chief Justice at a ceremony in the Supreme Court on 23 January 2013. Peiris is a Roman Catholic.
Appointment.
The appointment and removal of Judges of the Supreme Court is outlined in Chapter XV Article 107. of the Sri Lankan Constitution. It states that "the Chief Justice and every other Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President of the Republic by warrant under his hand". Judges of the Supreme Court shall hold office until the age of retirement of sixty-five years. Article 109. describes appointments of an acting Chief Justice or Judge of the Supreme Court. The President shall appoint another Judge of the Supreme Court to act in the office of Chief Justice when the incumbent is "temporarily unable to exercise, perform and discharge the powers, duties and functions of his office, by reason of illness, absence from the country or any other cause" during such period. Each person appointed to or to act as Chief Justice or a Judge of the Supreme Court shall only take office and enter upon its duties after he or she takes and subscribes or makes and subscribes before the President, the oath or the affirmation set out in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution.
Judges of the Supreme Court shall hold office during good behaviour. Removal of a judge shall only proceed with an address of the Parliament supported by a majority of the total number of Members of Parliament, (including those who are not present), and then by an order of the President. Reasons for such removal should be on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. 
Duties.
The Chief Justice serves as Chairman of the Judicial Service Commission which consist two Judges of the Supreme Court appointed by the President of the Republic. Other duties of the Chief Justice include nominating judges, as may be necessary, to each such High Court. Every Judge shall be transferable by the Chief Justice.

Bristol Bagshot

The Bristol Bagshot, also known as the Type 95 was a prototype for a heavily armed British fighter built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company and first flown in 1927. Flight testing revealed serious problems, and the project was abandoned. 
Development.
The Bagshot was built to Air Ministry Specification F.4/24 in December 1924. This called for a large twin-engined fighter aircraft with a crew of 3 (pilot and two gunners), a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 kph) and a landing speed of 50 mph (80 kph). Initially the details of the required armament were not specified. Frank Barnwell's design to meet this requirement, the Bagshot, was a high wing all-metal monoplane with an unusual triangular-section fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage with two upper longerons and a single lower member. The pilot sat in line with the wing's leading edge, with one gun position in the nose and another just behind the wing. The two-spar wing had a steel primary structure and duralumin nose ribs and end-members, and was a semi-cantilever, being braced by a pair of diagonal struts on each side. The legs of the fixed undercarriage met the wing at the same place as the struts and had an axle fairing of aerofoil section, contributing some lift. Power was provided by two wing-mounted Bristol Jupiter VI engines.
In September 1925 the Air Ministry amended the specification, calling for supercharged engines, increased fuel load and a higher top speed at altitude. Barnwell attended a design conference to discuss these new demands and was told that the purpose of the aircraft was to carry a pair of Coventry Ordnance Works 37mm (1.460 in) cannon, (generally called COW guns). When Barnwell subsequently received the full details of the required equipment, which called for two Lewis guns in addition to the main armament, he realised that the aircraft would be overweight and have a landing speed of . He suggested making an alternative fuselage of rolled steel strip in order to save weight, abandoning the project as a waste of time if load testing of this proved unsatisfactory. However, the Air Ministry declined to cancel the contract and the Bagshot was completed, being provisionally accepted by the Air Ministry on 12 May 1927 and assigned serial number J7767.
Operational history.
The Bagshot was first flown without any armament at Filton on 15 July 1927 by Cyril Uwins, Bristol's chief test pilot. This first flight was short: 'Always a bad sign' remarks Archibald Russell (later Sir Archibald), who at that time was working in the stress calculations office at Filton. Uwins reported that control in the roll axis was poor. A second flight, during which Uwins pushed the speed up to 100 mph, revealed that the problem became worse as the speed increased. Uwins was unable to observe the wing's behaviour (He had a damaged neck thanks to an aircraft accident). It was decided that the aircraft was safe enough to carry an observer if the speed was kept down, and Russell, who had recently been working on measuring the deflection of the aircraft's wing spars under load, was given the job. The rear gun position gave an excellent view of the wing. Uwins and Russell agreed a simple system of hand signals in order to communicate.
By the time the aircraft reached the agreed speed and height for the trials Russell was already very concerned. But although the "writhing movements" of the wing were "large and alarming" he had no signal to tell Uwins that enough was enough, and so the whole planned flight program was flown. 
It was concluded that control reversal resulting from twisting of the wing when the ailerons were applied was the cause of the problems. The aircraft was grounded for a structural test to be made. Subsequently it was transferred to the Air Ministry's experimental unit and briefly flown during 1931, but shortly afterwards broken up for scrap.

Funniest Show on Earth () is a 1953 Italian comedy film directed by Mario Mattoli and starring May Britt. It is the first Italian film in 3D.
It was filmed with a three-dimensional shooting system patented by Carlo Ponti and Dino De Laurentiis and called "PoDelVision" (from the initials of their surnames), which prescribed the simultaneous use of more cameras and then the printing of two identical copies of films: one for the left eye and one for the right eye. 
The film is an explicit parody of Cecil B. DeMille's "The Greatest Show on Earth".

In the circus a clown named Tottons Togni (Totò), obliged not to make-up off never to not reveal his identity, is constantly haunted by jealousy of three women (a lion tamer, a fantasist, a trapeze artist) and also by the investigation of a police officer.
The plot is a clear pretext for a series of numbers taken from magazines Toto (such as the gay hairdresser and masseuse).

Robert B Mellor

Robert Brooke Mellor (b Huddersfield UK) is a British biologist, known for his "unified vacuole theory" which states that in endosymbioses generally, the micro-symbiont and the macro-symbiont share their lytic vacuolar compartments. This stems from his earlier "symbiosome" (or "lysosome theory") which states that the organelle that microsymbionts inhabit partially takes over the lysosomal functions in these cells, analogous to the role of protein bodies in seeds.
In other works Mellor has claimed that in legumes the root nodule cytoplasm may be under water stress and the plant may combat this by producing trehalose. Indeed this may explain why nodulated plants have a higher drought-tolerance than non-nodulated plants.
Mellor was also very interested in how plants distinguish between symbiotic and pathogenic infections and in 1984 set about measuring defence responses in nodules infected with different Rhizobial mutants and it gradually appeared that in Rhizobia the nod genes are responsible for producing different nod factors (lipo-chitin molecules) and that amongst their many effects was that they can provoke plant defence responses, so that it was essential that these genes were switched off (by molecules called "nodoffs") after infection, or that symbiosis could not take place. This convincing model won general acclaim and indeed the paper with David Collinge was later reprinted as that year’s number one most important publication.
However Mellor was also interested in applied science and invented and a patented system to power immobilized oxido-reductase enzymes and artificial co-factors using electrical power out of a domestic socket.
Present Work.
In early 2000 he joined and helped start-up the IT University of Copenhagen after which he became Director of Enterprise at Kingston University [http://www.kingston.ac.uk, London, in Computing, Information Systems and Mathematics. Robert teaches innovation and the mathematical modelling of business processes at MSc level at Kingston University. Robert Brooke Mellor [http://www.mellor.it] is author of over 120 scientific publications in reputable journals and ten books, several of which have been translated into other languages. He is an active consultant with over twelve years industrial experience and lectures at postgraduate level on subjects like ‘strategic information systems’, ‘knowledge management’, ‘strategic innovation’ and ‘entrepreneurship’.

Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Subroutines

The Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software (NOVAS) is a software library for astrometry-related numerical computations. It is developed by the Astronomical Applications Department, United States Naval Observatory. Currently, NOVAS has three different editions for C, Fortran, and Python, respectively.
Algorithms.
The algorithms used by NOVAS are based on vector astrometry theories and the IAU resolutions. Instead of using trigonometric formulae from spherical astrometry, NOVAS uses the matrix and vector formulation which is more rigorous. This version implements the resolutions on astronomical reference systems and Earth rotation models passed at the IAU General Assemblies in 1997, 2000, and 2006. According to the Astronomical Applications Department, the algorithms used in NOVAS are identical to those used in the production of the US part of the Astronomical Almanac.
A detailed description of the algorithms can be found here: Kaplan, et al. (1989) "Astron. J." 97, 1197.
Structure.
The NOVAS library provides three levels of subroutines (functions): basic, utility, and supervisory. Basic-level subroutines supply the values of fundamental variables, such as the nutation angles and the heliocentric positions of solar system bodies for specific epoches. Utility-level subroutines perform transformations, such as those caused by precession, nutation and aberration. Supervisory-level subroutines serve as interfaces to the basic and utility subroutines to compute the coordinates of stars or solar system bodies for specific dates and times.
Usage.
The NOVAS library can be linked by programs that work with positions of celestial bodies. For example, "Pocket Stars", an astronomy software for Smartphone and PDA platforms, used the NOVAS as its astrometry engine.
A Python library, PyNOVAS, can be used to call NOVAS functions from Python. It uses SWIG to connect with the C version of NOVAS.
Current status.
A new version of NOVAS is being developed.

William Nathaniel Jones

William Nathaniel Jones (20 March 1858 – 24 May 1934) was a Welsh Liberal politician, businessman and soldier.
Jones, who served as a Justice of the Peace in Carmarthenshire, married Margaret Francis of Llandilo. In business, he was a director of the Ammanford Gas Company and the Duke Anthracite Collieries Ltd and the owner of Birchgrove Steelworks, Swansea. He was appointed High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire for 1924. 
Jones was a member of both Carmarthenshire County Council and Ammanford Urban District Council.
Parliamentary candidate.
In 1926, Sir Alfred Mond the Liberal MP for Carmarthen defected to the Conservatives over the issue of land policy and the proposal by David Lloyd George that some agricultural land be nationalised. The policy had been set out in the publication "Land and the Nation" or the "Green Book" in October 1925 but it caused great debate in the Liberal Party and another MP, Hilton Young, who sat for Norwich also left the party for the Tories along with a couple of former MPs. Mond decided not to resign and fight a by-election but there was an election to choose a successor to him to stand as a Liberal at the next election. This was initially contested by six candidates but four withdrew and the choice was between Jones and Richard Thomas Evans of Cardiff. Jones won in a close contest by 149 votes to 147, having made clear he was an opponent of the "Green Book" land policy whereas Evans, who had worked closely with Lloyd George on other Liberal policies, was in favour. Evans however was later become MP for Carmarthen, sitting from 1931-35. At the time of the by-election, and in other sources referring to him in 1882, Jones was described variously as Lieutenant-Colonel or Colonel Jones but no indication of his army history is available in those sources.
Carmarthen by-election, 1928.
In the event Jones did not have to wait until the next general election as Mond accepted a peerage in 1928 and caused a by-election in Carmarthen. At the previous general election in 1924 the Conservatives had not fielded a candidate and Mond had won easily in a straight fight with Labour. However this time, they put up the barrister, Sir Courtenay Mansel, another escapee from the Liberal Party in 1926 who had been MP for Penryn and Falmouth from 1922-23 but who had local connections in Carmarthenshire and was also a Justice of the Peace there. The Labour candidate was the Welsh barrister (and future MP) Dan Hopkin. There was briefly the prospect of a four-cornered contest when the National Party of Wales announced their intention to stand a candidate but in the end they decided not to fight. The by-election took place on 28 June 1928 and Jones emerged as the narrow winner. Jones had made his opposition to the land policy a feature of the campaign in an attempt to retain the support of the division’s farmers, many of whom shared Mond’s concern about the nationalisation proposals. In any event the "Green Book" had by this time been withdrawn as a full statement of Liberal land policy. Instead, Jones promoted as the main object of Liberal land policy the desire to give security of tenure to tenant farmers. Many of those reliant on the land for their livelihood seemed to prefer the less radical solution of the government of Stanley Baldwin for the relief of rates on agricultural land.
Polling.
Polling day itself was affected by bad weather with heavy rain dampening the candidates’ enthusiasm on the day and, it was reported, having a detrimental effect on turnout. However the official figures showed a turnout of 76.6% an improvement over the previous general election when only 68% had turned out to vote. In the end, Jones had majority of just 47 votes over his Labour opponent, polling 10,201 to Hopkins’s 10,154 with Mansel for the Tories on 8,361. The drastic reduction in the size of the majority, even taking into account the fact that the Tories contested the seat, was a disappointment to the Liberals. Perhaps Liberal supporters felt they had been taken for granted by their party. Of their two previous MPs one had resigned to cause a by-election to find a seat for Sir Alfred Mond and then Mond himself had defected to the Tories without standing down to seek a mandate for his new party.
Later elections.
The by-election did presage a change in political fortunes in the constituency. At the 1929 general election Jones lost the seat to Dan Hopkin in another three-cornered fight. Evans regained it for the Liberals in 1931 but lost to Hopkin in 1935. The seat returned to the Liberals in 1945 when it was won Sir Rhys Hopkin Morris but was recaptured for Labour in 1957 at the by-election which was caused by Hopkin Morris’ death; the successful Labour candidate being Lady Megan Lloyd George who had herself defected from Liberal to Labour.
Death.
Jones died suddenly at Llanwrtyd Wells on 24 May 1934. He died intestate, leaving an estate of gross value £75,950.

Eve Tokimatsuri

Backstory.
The original Eve Tokimatsuri was born in the 24th Century on Earth. She was the personal assistant of the polymath Professor Ferdinand F. Heinkel. Prof. Heinkel and Eve were advocates of the Earth Reclamation Project. The project involved the construction of the Megazone generation ships that would ferry the survivors of a global holocaust that ravaged the Earth. 
Prof. Heinkel constructed a computer program named EVE that would be dedicated to the nurturing and preservation of the human survivors aboard the Megazones. EVE was essential in deceiving the inhabitants of each Megazone into thinking that they still lived on Earth during particular eras in Earth History (e.g. Megazone 23 was modelled after Tokyo circa 1980-1985). The program was integrated into the Bahamut supercomputers that governed each Megazone. The EVE program's visual interface was modelled after Eve Tokimatsuri's likeness.
When Prof. Heinkel was assassinated in the year 2353, Eve Tokimatsuri elected to enter a cryogenic slumber on Earth. She is stored near the foundations of Eden City (Megazone 33) - the only Megazone that did not take flight to the stars.
The EVE Program.
The First Movie.
Somewhere between the 24th and 29th centuries, the EVE program aboard Megazone 23 achieved a state of self-awareness. She presented herself to the citizens of the Megazone as a charismatic singer / talk show hostess. During the events of the first Megazone 23 movie, she is in a struggle to maintain her autonomy from the military, who uses her likeness and voice as a propaganda tool in the war effort against the Dezalg - an offshoot of the human race descended from Mars colonists.
Eve becomes aware of Shogo Yahagi - a young motorcyclist who steals an experimental transformable mecha known as the Proto-Garland. Eve uses the Proto-Garland's communication system to contact Shogo. She reveals to him the whole history of the Megazones and their departure from Earth five centuries before. She implores him to help stop the military from overriding her core programming. When Shogo is defeated in one-on-one combat with Major B. D., she helps him to regain consciousness by singing through the communication link aboard the damaged Garland.
The Second Movie.
The sequel takes place six months after the first movie. It depicts the EVE program still rebelling against the military's plans to subvert all the Megazone's resources for war. She sends intermittent transmissions via radio and television to contact "Operator 7G" - her term for Shogo. The military has subverted enough of her program to generate propaganda media using her likeness. Shogo and his new companions - the biker/squatter gang Trash - are nostalgic for the antebellum Eve, who sang songs of love and peace. Shogo is determined to raid the Bahamut tower and communicate directly with Eve. When Shogo and Trash execute the raid, Shogo's girlfriend Yui Takanaka is critically wounded. Shogo carries Yui to a hidden chamber within Bahamut where Eve makes contact with the heroes of the story. Eve urges Shogo to place Yui in an alcove where Eve can tend to Yui's wounds. While Yui recuperates. Eve guides Shogo through a holographic dreamscape where she tries to determine Shogo's nature, values and his reasons for defying the military. Eve praises Shogo's basic goodness and announces that Megazone 23 is completing its return trajectory toward Earth. Eve liaises with a defense weapon based on the Moon called ADAM (another creation of Prof. Heinkel). ADAM determines Megazone 23 and the Dezalg mothership that pursues it are hostile forces and proceeds to dismantle and destroy the two generation ships. As Megazone 23 disintegrates, Eve sings a mournful dirge for the people who die aboard the ship. Eve manages to save a handful of survivors - Shogo, Yui and members of the Trash gang - by gathering them into the Bahamut tower. The tower serves as an escape capsule, that jettisons the survivors from the dying Megazone and deposits them on a revived, re-greened Earth.
Eve Re-awakens.
The Third Movie.
The final movie takes place several centuries - possibly a full millennium - after the events of the second Megazone 23 movie. The original Eve Tokimatsuri is revived from her slumber beneath Eden City by Eiji Takanaka. She allies herself with Eiji as the two conspire to dismantle the "System" - a Bahamut that governs Eden City. Eve, Eiji and their compatriots manage to prevail over the System and its plan to banish the human race to the stars once more. Eve elects to depart the Earth on a one-way mission to the Moon to dismantle the ADAM system once and for all - freeing the human race from cybernetic overlords of any kind.
Appearance.
In the first movie, Eve appears as a fifteen-year old girl with long platinum blond hair. She wears a variety of stage costumes. When the military subverts Eve for use as a propaganda tool, she appears with brunette hair cut short and wears military garb.
In the second movie, Eve's mane is colored pastel green. Her wardrobe varies, but in her hidden chamber within Bahamut her holographic avatar wears a loose fitting robe reminiscent of a Sibylline oracle.
In the third movie, the original Eve has close-cropped, platinum blonde hair. She appears in two versions, one virtual, who alternates between an all-blue jumpsuit, and a white tie-fastened shirt and orange tribal-patterned pants, and a 'real' version who wears a dark tunic with a severely short skirt and tall black boots. Notably, The version of Eve from the first two movies appears, within the Bahamut chamber, in the same robes as before, but with her hairstyle and color changed to match Eve's,
She also appears in a new variant in "Megazone 23: Aoi Garland".

Malawian general election, 2009

A General Election was held in Malawi on 19 May 2009. President Bingu wa Mutharika ran for re-election; his main opponent was John Tembo, the President of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP). Five other candidates also ran. The election was won by Mutharika, who was re-elected to the Presidency with around two-thirds of the vote. Mutharika's DPP also won a strong parliamentary majority.
Registration and electoral timetable.
Voter registration started in August 2008 and was scheduled to end on 29 November 2008, but on 20 November (by which time 3.5 million voters had been registered) it was announced that registration would be extended into December. This extension was caused by problems related to digital cameras that were necessary to the process.
Between 2 February and 6 February, presidential and parliamentary candidates submitted their nomination papers. The official campaigning period began on 17 March and is scheduled to conclude on 17 May. Parliament was dissolved on 20 March, in accordance with the constitution, and subsequently the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC)will announce which candidates have been deemed eligible.
Candidacies.
On 22 October 2008, Hetherwick Ntaba, the Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), announced that the DPP national governing council had unanimously endorsed Mutharika as the party's presidential candidate a few days earlier. However, Foreign Minister Joyce Banda said on 16 January 2009 that Mutharika felt the endorsement of the council was inadequate and that he wanted the endorsement of the party's base. Therefore he sought the backing of the delegates at a DPP convention. Later, as the DPP presidential candidate, Mutharika chose Banda as his vice-presidential candidate.
Bakili Muluzi, who was designated as the UDF's (United Democratic Front)presidential candidate, previously served two terms as President from 1994 to 2004. According to the constitution, a President is allowed to serve no more than two consecutive five-year terms. Because Muluzi had been out of office since 2004, his supporters argued that the term limit should not apply to him, as it did not restrict nonconsecutive terms if interpreted literally.
Speaking to Capital Radio on 22 February 2009, Muluzi accused the government of using intimidation against his candidacy and warned that such conduct could lead to "problems". A few days later, he was charged by the Anti-Corruption Bureau with stealing 12 million dollars of aid money; he appeared before a court in Blantyre and was released on bail. The Electoral Commission stated he was not eligible to run again, but his supporters are calling for an official court decision instead. On 16 May, only three days before the election, the Constitutional Court ruled that Muluzi could not run again.
MCP President John Tembo was considered the main opposition candidate, and the MCP formed an electoral alliance with the UDF prior to the election. Tembo's vice-presidential candidate was Brown Mpinganjira of the UDF. Observing that the DPP had never participated in an election (it was founded in 2005), Tembo argued that he and the MCP had the experience to govern the country properly: "I belong to the past, I belong to the present and I also belong to the future."
Independent candidate James Nyondo submitted his nomination papers on 4 February and claims to have sponsored over 120 independent parliamentary candidates by paying the MK 100,000 ($700 USD) nomination fee. He is the only independent candidate in the 2009 presidential election and has campaigned on the need for a new generation of leadership, a smaller cabinet, and an end to the personal extravagance of the current and previous governments.
Loveness Gondwe of the New Rainbow Coalition submitted her presidential candidacy on 3 February, becoming the first woman to run for President in Malawi. She stressed the importance of holding a free and fair election and avoiding the kind of post-election turmoil that affected Kenya and Zimbabwe in 2008.
Observers expected a close election between the two strongest candidates, Mutharika and Tembo. While Tembo enjoyed the united backing of the country's two most established and powerful parties—the MCP and the UDF—he faced an incumbent President who had presided over strong economic growth of 8%, and the outcome was considered uncertain.
Mutharika, who was 75 years old at the time of the election, said that he would retire from politics if he lost the election and that he would retire in 2014 if he was successful in winning a second term.
The election and subsequent events.
On the day of the election, Joy Radio, which is owned by UDF Chairman Bakili Muluzi, was closed by the police after it broadcast a satire that lampooned Mutharika. Two of the station's presenters and a technician were arrested. The Malawi Electoral Commission declared that Bingu wa Mutharika had won the presidential election on 21 May 2009, after 93% of votes had been counted. Mutharika gained 2.7 million votes with John Tembo, his nearest rival, winning 1.2 million. Tembo alleged that the government had committed electoral fraud with opposition poll agents being denied access to the vote counting centres. An EU observation team also noted that state television had failed to be neutral during the election campaigns, supporting the government.
Partial official results for the parliamentary election showed that of the 193 seats the Democratic Progressive Party had won 78, the Malawi Congress Party had won 18, the United Democratic Front had won 12, and the Alliance for Democracy and the Malawi Forum for Unity and Development won one each. Independent candidates had won 23 seats. Ultimately the DPP won 114 seats (though the election of the vice president vacated one of those), obtaining a strong majority in the 193-seat National Assembly, while the MCP trailed distantly with 26 seats and the UDF won only 17. Mutharika and the DPP won an overwhelming victory in northern Malawi, but also performed well in the central and southern regions, although those regions have been historically dominated by the MCP and UDF respectively. Some analysts suggested that this election marked a departure from Malawi's traditional voting patterns, which are heavily influenced by region. Unlike Tembo, Muluzi accepted the official results of the election. 32 independent MPs were elected, though many of those started joining the DPP after the election; one seat was won by the Maravi People's Party (MPP), the Alliance for Democracy (Aford) and the Malawi Forum for Unity and Development (MAFUNDE). In one constituency, the election was postponed.
Mutharika and Joyce Banda were respectively sworn in as President and Vice-President on 22 May 2009. The MCP boycotted the event, but Muluzi was present. Some in the MCP called for the party to recognize Mutharika's victory and for Tembo to resign as MCP President. Tembo refused and vowed to legally challenge the results.

Crowne Plaza Niagara Falls – Fallsview

Crowne Plaza Niagara Falls – Fallsview is a historic hotel located in the Falls Avenue complex (which is formally known as the Falls Avenue Entertainment Complex) in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.
History.
The hotel was originally built in 1929 as the Hotel General Brock. It was designed by The Pigott Company of Hamilton, Ontario. The hotel was named for Sir Isaac Brock, a British Major General who defended Canada from the Americans in the War of 1812. 
The General Brock was bought by Sheraton in the 1950s and was renamed the Brock-Sheraton Hotel, a name it kept for more than forty years. In the 1990s, the property left Sheraton and was renamed the Skyline Brock and then the Brock Plaza Hotel in the early 2000s. The hotel joined the InterContinental Hotels chain in 2008 and was again renamed the Crowne Plaza Niagara Falls-Fallsview Hotel.
In popular culture.
In 1952, the 20th Century-Fox film "Niagara" was shot in Niagara Falls. Marilyn Monroe, Joseph Cotten, and Jean Peters all stayed at the Brock, with Marilyn staying in room 801. 
In 2000, the final scene of the film "The Whole Nine Yards" was shot on one of the balconies of the Brock Plaza Hotel.

Bristol Type 101

__NOTOC__
The Bristol Type 101, was a British two-seat fighter prototype in the 1920s. 
Development.
Designed as a private venture, the 101 was of mixed construction, a single-bay, two-seat design, the fuselage being a plywood-covered box-girder spruce structure and the two-spar wings being of steel with fabric skinning. It was powered by the same engine as the Type 95 - a 450 hp (340 kW) Bristol Jupiter VI. Armament consisted of two synchronised .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns as well as a ring-mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun at the rear.
Operational history.
Cleaner and more compact than most aircraft in its class, the 101 displayed a relatively high performance when first flown in 1927. However, it was rejected by the Air Ministry due to its wood construction, which was seen as out-of-date. No other buyers could be found and no more aircraft were produced. Continued as a private venture, it first flew at Filton on 8 August 1927, piloted by Cyril Uwins, registered "G-EBOW". With the VIA powerplant, Uwins achieved second place in the 1928 King's Cup race at an average speed of 159.9 mph. Subsequently used as a company hack and as a test bed for the 485 hp Bristol Mercury II nine-cylinder radial, it suffered wing centre section failure on 29 November 1929 while being subjected to engine overspeeding tests, the pilot, C. R. I. Shaw, bailing out successfully. This was the last wooden Bristol fighter built.

2004–05 Arsenal F.C. season

The 2004–05 season was Arsenal's 85th consecutive season in the top division of English football and 15th in the Premier League. 
The club entered the season as champions after finishing the 2003–04 league season unbeaten, but had been knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and the FA Cup and the semi-finals of the Football League Cup, so they were areas that manager Arsène Wenger looked to improve upon for the coming season. Arsenal also looked towards beating the unbeaten league record of Nottingham Forest as, coming into the season, they were 40 league games unbeaten and needed 2 to equal and 3 to beat the record. This unbeaten run came to an end at 49 games following a 2–0 defeat away to Manchester United, in a match dubbed the "Battle of the Buffet".
Arsenal's sportsmanship was again rewarded at the end of the season with the club winning the Barclays Fair Play Award for the second year in a row.
Premier League.
August–October.
Arsenal began their defence of the league title against Everton on 15 August 2004. Cesc Fàbregas was named in the first eleven, in absence of Vieira and at 17 years 103 days, became the club's youngest ever Premier League player. It was Dennis Bergkamp on his 500th league appearance who opened the scoring for Arsenal and Reyes headed-in from Fredrik Ljungberg's cross to make it 2–0. Ljungberg added a third goal in the second half and in spite of the team conceding moments after, Robert Pirès scored Arsenal's fourth in the 83rd minute. Shortly before the kick-off at home to Middlesbrough the following weekend, Arsenal were presented a golden replica of the Premier League trophy, to mark their unbeaten season. In the match, Thierry Henry gave Arsenal the lead, which was cancelled out before half time by Joseph-Désiré Job's goal-bound effort. Four minutes after the interval, Franck Queudrue exploited an error from defender Pascal Cygan and in turn passed the ball to Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, who "finish with perfect brutality". Queudrue himself scored to put Middlesbrough 3–1 up; this was followed by a "remarkable comeback", where Bergkamp, Reyes and Pirès each scored to help Arsenal overcome at the final whistle and win 5–3. The result meant the team equalled Nottingham Forest's record of 42 league matches undefeated. Three days later, Arsenal beat Blackburn Rovers to set an all-time league record; the opening goal, scored by Henry prompted "Match of the Day" commentator John Motson to mutter: "Isn't that just Henry? Isn't that just Arsenal? Isn't that just typical?" Arsenal at the end of the month travelled to Norwich City, where three first half goals set the team on the way to a 4–1 victory. The win ended the opponent’s eight-month undefeated record at Carrow Road.

Postage stamps and postal history of Dalmatia

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Dalmatia.
Italian occupation.
In May 1919, Italy issued special postage stamps for the part of Dalmatia it had occupied during World War I.
The stamps were produced as surcharges of Italian stamps; the first appeared 1 May 1919, and consisted of the Italian 1-lira overprinted "una / corona". 5c and 10c overprints were issued in 1921, reading "5 / centesimi / di corona", followed by an additional five values in 1922. Similar overprints were made for special delivery and postage due stamps.
Soon after the annexed territories switched to Italian currency and stamps. As a result, usage was uncommon and validly-used stamps are today worth about 50-100% more than unused. They are easily confused with the Italian issues used in occupied Austria; the Dalmatian overprints are distinguished by their use of a sans serif typeface.
German occupation.
Parts of Dalmatia were occupied by Germany in September 1943 and stamps of Germany were overprinted for use in this area, centered around Zara.

Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development

Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development (WIRED) was a project of the United States Department of Labor. It provided a new approach to workforce and economic development. Through the WIRED model, regions integrated economic and workforce development activities to demonstrate that talent development can drive economic transformation in regional economies across the United States.
History.
Birth of the Public Workforce System.
The WIRED Initiative was conceived from lessons learned since the birth of the public workforce system in the 1930s. The workforce system was designed for the economy of the day - an economy characterized by interchangeable labor, cyclical layoffs and a workforce that required no more than a high school diploma. These New Deal policies firmly established the federal government's commitment to minimizing hardships associated with unemployment and facilitating a worker's return to work.
In the 1960s, a job training system was created to serve American workers. Like other programs of the day, the system was designed on a social services model. Policies like the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) of 1962 and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 had little private sector involvement and governed a system that saw over 40 percent of its participants engaged in subsidized employment.
In 1982, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) was enacted, replacing CETA. JTPA eliminated the Public Service Employment Program (part of CETA) and increased funding for job training.
WIA.
The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) reformed the structure established by the JTPA. The act, which was approved with strong bipartisan support, streamlined service delivery through One-Stop Career Centers, strengthened performance accountability, promoted universal access to services, created business-led state and local boards and promoted individual choice.
High Growth Job Training Initiative.
To address the growing need for skilled workers, DOL identified industries of our economy that could significantly benefit from talent development; industries that are experiencing rapid growth or a significant transformation in the skills required of its employees. Launched in 2003, the President's High Growth Job Training Initiative engages these identified industries in the talent development, connects businesses to the workforce system and creates programs designed to meet their specific workforce needs. The initiative takes a groundbreaking approach to closing skills gaps by developing solutions to workforce challenges and creating partnerships among business, education institutions and the workforce community.
Community-Based Job Training Grants.
The President's Community-Based Job Training Grants address the need for a partnership between the workforce system and the vocational education system, increase the capacity of community colleges to meet the demands of today's employers and recognize community colleges as an easily adaptable and viable means for talent development. The grants provide schools the resources to hire faculty, and purchase equipment and facilities they needed to train and educate workers for jobs in the high-growth fields. These grants were first made available in 2005, and are designed to bridge community colleges with business and industry to better address talent development. Additionally, Community-Based Job Training Grants also help strengthen the relationship between the job training system and the community college system.
The jobs of today and tomorrow require individuals with postsecondary education and community colleges are the most flexible, affordable and accessible option for many Americans. As more competition enters the global market, workers from around the globe are competing with Americans for jobs and winning. The Community Based Job Training Grants empower community colleges to provide greater opportunities for Americans and keeps our nation competitive in the global economy.
Regional Economies.
Globalization has changed the formula for developing a prepared workforce and necessitated a change in visualizing the boundaries of an economy. An economy is no longer defined by the political boundaries of a city, county or state line. Instead, economies are defined regionally by a diverse group of industries, supported by factors such as infrastructure, investment and an availability of local talent. This regional concept promotes partnerships among key community players, including K-12 schools, community colleges, adult education centers, universities, regional employers and community economic and workforce development organizations. This is supported by academic developments, as scholars like Porter (2000) argue for the continuing importance of industry clusters for economic development at both the macro and micro level.
The Birth of WIRED.
On February 1, 2006, U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao announced the WIRED Initiative, encompassing these ideals to better align workforce and economic development. WIRED takes a critical step in providing individuals with the tools for success, businesses the human capital required for growth, and the American economy the fuel for continued strength.
Activities.
In February 2006, following a Solicitation for Grant Applications, the Employment & Training Administration (ETA) announced 13 regions that comprise the WIRED 1st Generation. These regions were selected on the basis of a number of criteria, including (1) the viability of regionally competitive clusters; (2) a framework for public-private administration of the program; (3) evidence of economic distress in the region; and (4) a detailed plan for systematic interconnections between public workforce administration agencies, educational institutions, nonprofits, and private industry. First Generation regions face various challenges in economic development and sustainability including: remaining competitive with a globalized workforce; managing existing growth opportunities; and creating a more innovative economy by focusing on developing small business. First Generation WIRED Regions were awarded $15 million over three years to revitalize their local economy.
In April, 2006, ETA added 13 additional regions, then known as the Virtual Regions. These regions received a $100,000 planning grant, were invited to participate in all WIRED-related activities and were given access to the tools and resources developed. In January 2007, these regions became the 2nd Generation Regions and received an immediate investment of $500,000. This investment supports the development of a comprehensive implementation plan. Upon completion and acceptance of this plan, each region will receive an additional $4.5 million investment over a three-year period.
On June 20, 2007, ETA announced the expansion of the WIRED Initiative. Thirteen applications were selected to become the Third Generation of WIRED Regions. Each will receive a $5 million investment over a three-year period.
All 39 WIRED Regions were supported by managers from ETA and the WIRED resource team, as well as access to various staff from other federal agencies. This expanded team provided the regions with tools and technical assistance that assisted them with implementing their plan for regional economic growth.
In addition to the monetary investments, a number of activities took place in support of the WIRED regions including:
Critical Reception.
Recent academic literature seems to reinforce WIRED's rationale. Indeed, there are two economic development forces—which often theoretically overlap—at work here: one at the micro level (the specific programs of the grantee regions) and one at the macro level (the federal government). At the grantee level, as Renski (2009) notes, “there are really no new ideas in WIRED. Clusters, partnerships, regional competitiveness, asset mapping—the buzzwords of WIRED—have been a part of the vernacular of the economic development profession for quite some time." In this respect, the WIRED initiative as a whole incorporates a number of well-accepted economic development practices, while leaving specific application to each grantee region. Blakeley and Leigh (2010), Porter (2000), and Renski note that cities and regions have long practiced economic development techniques like fostering cluster development to stimulate innovation and technology spillover to remain competitive in a global market. 
Yet, at the macro level, subsidizing this approach regionally is new. Renski points out that “the novel aspect of WIRED is simply that it is administered and funded by the U.S. federal government, who has had little involvement in regional economic development since the 1970s.” Markusen and Glassmeier (2008) note that “In general, federal economic development programs place too much emphasis on physical infrastructure and not enough on human capital and ‘soft’ infrastructure, meaning organizational know-how and networking.” Thus, it is the focus on regional growth that crosses traditional political and jurisdictional boundaries which makes WIRED a notable program in the conversation on effective economic development policy.

Alexander Henry (Philadelphia)

Alexander Henry (April 14, 1823 – December 6, 1883) was the mayor of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the American Civil War. He was prominent in the efforts to suppress Confederate sympathizers within the city early in the war, and helped organize civilians to assist in constructing earthworks to defend the city during the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign.
Biography.
Henry was born and raised in Philadelphia, and was educated in local schools. He was a son of John Snowden Henry and Elizabeth (Bayard) Henry, and a grandson of Philadelphia businessman Alexander Henry. He graduated with high honors from Princeton University in 1840. He studied law, passed his bar exam in 1844, and established a prosperous legal firm. He became active in local politics and represented the Seventh Ward on the City Council from 1856-57.
In 1858, running as a member of the People's Party, he was elected mayor, defeating incumbent Richard Vaux. Henry took office on May 11. Among his platforms was strong support for the city's proposed system of public transportation, including streetcars. He also dramatically strengthened the police force.
Once the Civil War began in 1861, Philadelphia's southern leanings changed, and hostility moved from abolitionists to Southern sympathizers. Mobs threatened a secessionist newspaper and the homes of suspected sympathizers. Henry responded to the growing crisis, and led efforts, along with the city police, to turn away the rioters and quell the unrest. Henry aligned himself with the Republican Party and was reelected to successive terms.
During the Gettysburg Campaign in June 1863, he called out the home guard under Brig. General A. J. Pleasonton to help defend the city and encouraged citizens to help strengthen the line of earthworks and small forts ringing the main approaches to Philadelphia. Henry, along with Maj. Gen. Napoleon J. T. Dana, organized a work party of 700 men for this effort.
In late 1865, Henry chose not to run for another term and left office on January 1, 1866. He became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, and was a bank director for several years. He also was a leading member of the board of directors that planned the 1876 Centennial Exposition. He retired to a stately home in the Germantown region.
Henry died in Philadelphia at age 60 from pneumonia after returning from a prolonged visit to Europe after the death of his only child, his son. He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia's East Falls section.
Honors.
Henry Avenue in the Andorra neighborhood was named for the former mayor.

Uapaca kirkiana

Uapaca kirkiana or sugar plum is a species of plant in the Phyllanthaceae family. This is one of the most popular wild fruits in the zone where eastern Africa meets southern Africa. It is rarely cultivated but fruiting trees are left when land is being cleared. Still a traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known fruit has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.
In Shona, the fruit are referred to as mazhanje.
Growth.
The tree is dioecious and grows to a height of 5–13 meters, and 15–25 cm in trunk diameter. The dark green, glossy leaves are 12–36 cm long and 8–24 cm wide. It is not prone to attack by pests. It grows in areas with over 600mm/year of rain, and prefers well drained sand or gravelly soils low in organic matter; its presence is indicative of poor agricultural soils.
Fruit.
Female trees fruit after about 9–10 years from seed. The fruit is roughly spherical drupe about 2–4 cm in diameter, green in colour ripening to yellow or brown. When ripe, the 1.5mm hard shell encloses the yellow flesh which has an appealing sweet taste that has been likened to pear or plum. Fruits usually contain 3 or 4 seeds, though sometimes 5. Fruits weigh between 5 and 50 grams each, with from 0.2-30 grams of pulp.
Propagation.
It is usually propagated by seed, which is recalcitrant and germinates readily, reaching 90% after 6 weeks for fresh seed. The tree can also be propagated vegetatively - a success rate of 80% has been achieved with wedge or splice grafts. Air layering is also possible, though these trees have not fared well without a taproot. The tree naturally propagates via underground suckers and forms stands.
Cultivars.
Little work has been done developing cultivars, though some named varieties do exist. Since 1996, work on propagating of superior seedlings has been carried out in Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe by the Southern Africa Regional Programme.

Kungstornen

Kungstornen () are twin tower skyscrapers, individually named Norra Kungstornet and Södra Kungstornet, in Norrmalm, Stockholm. The 16-storey Norra Kungstornet is and was built between 1919 and 1924; and the taller 17-storey, Södra Kungstornet was built between 1924 and 1925. Together, they are considered the first modern skyscrapers in Europe.
The tower pair marks a slight bend in the street, one block east of Hötorget, where it is crossed by the Malmskillnadsbron, a bridge in the course of Malmskillnadsgatan, to which they are adjacent. They are and of similar, but not identical, exterior design. Their construction was inspired by American models, particularly the architecture of Lower Manhattan of the time. The north tower was designed by Sven Wallander who also authored the 1919 master plan for Kungsgatan; the southern tower was designed by Ivar Callander.

Juggler sequence

In recreational mathematics a juggler sequence is an integer sequence that starts with a positive integer "a"0, with each subsequent term in the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:
Background.
Juggler sequences were publicised by American mathematician and author Clifford A. Pickover. The name is derived from the rising and falling nature of the sequences, like balls in the hands of a juggler.
For example, the juggler sequence starting with "a"0 = 3 is
If a juggler sequence reaches 1, then all subsequent terms are equal to 1. It is conjectured that all juggler sequences eventually reach 1. This conjecture has been verified for initial terms up to 106, but has not been proved. Juggler sequences therefore present a problem that is similar to the Collatz conjecture, about which Paul Erdős stated that "mathematics is not yet ready for such problems".
For a given initial term "n", one defines "l"("n") to be the number of steps which the juggler sequence starting at "n" takes to first reach 1, and "h"("n") to be the maximum value in the juggler sequence starting at "n". For small values of "n" we have:
Juggler sequences can reach very large values before descending to 1. For example, the juggler sequence starting at "a"0 = 37 reaches a maximum value of 24906114455136. Harry J. Smith has determined that the juggler sequence starting at "a"0 = 48443 reaches a maximum value at "a"60 with 972,463 digits, before reaching 1 at "a"157.

History.
Although Limmie Snell was born in Dalton, Alabama, his family moved to Canton when he was very young. He recorded with Columbia Records from age 11 as a solo artist before joining family members Jimmy and Martha Snell to form Limmie & the Family Cooking. They released one single on Scepter Records, then signed with Avco Embassy, where they released three singles which hit the UK Singles Chart in 1973-74: "You Can Do Magic" (UK #3), "Dreamboat" (UK #31), and "A Walking Miracle" (UK #6). The last of them was a cover of a song by The Essex. Despite their success in the UK, they dented the US charts only once, with "You Can Do Magic" (#84 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #42 on the "Billboard" Black Singles Chart). Their releases were primarily produced by Sandy Linzer and Steve Metz.
Because of their popularity in the UK, they continued performing there regularly into the 1980s. They split into two musical ensemble, the second of which was formed in 1976 under the name Limmie Funk Unlimited. Its line-up consisted of Limmie on vocals, Nick Straker AKA Nick Bailey on Keyboards, Pete Hammond on bass, Andy Gierus on guitar and Phil Towner on drums

<doc id="18677826" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18677826" title="Detarium senegalense">
Detarium senegalense

Detarium senegalense is a leguminous tree from the Caesalpiniaceae family that produces globular fruits commonly referred to as ditax, ditakh, and detar. This multi-purpose plant that, along with producing nutritious fruits, is also used for a number of medicinal purposes and for its quality timber. "D. senegalense" has great potential for promoting food security, contributing to sustainable land care and rural development. As its Linnaean name indicates, it is native to Senegal and the surrounding countries of West Africa.
Description.
"D. senegalense" consists of medium-sized “tallow trees” that can grow up to 40 m tall. Coming from the Caesalpiniaceae family, these Angiosperm leguminous trees are dicots that grow thick and scattered branches. The trees can range from 60–100 cm in diameter. They produce globular drupe fruits that are characterized by their dark green coating, fibrous pulp, and seed. They are comparable to tamarind fruits which also originate from the Caelsapiniacae family. The fruits have an appealing sweet and sour flavour and a good shelf life due to a hard shell and dry pulp. Some trees produce toxic fruits and there is currently no method of differentiating these from trees that grow safe fruits.
Location and growing conditions.
Trees of the Detarium genus have remained undomesticated, and their growth currently remains confined to countries throughout West Africa. The fruits produced by the "D. senegalense" tree were first described as “detar” in 1789, by De Jussieu in Senegal, Africa. Being discovered in Senegal, these trees still remain an important contributor to the country’s local food system and economy. "Detarium senegalense" trees are typically found growing in gallery forests, savannas, or along river banks. 
"D. senegalense" trees are propagated by stones which are often distributed by elephants and chimpanzees who consume the fruits. Germination occurs 6–10 weeks after propagation, though the germination rate is typically low. Although tallow trees are leguminous, they do not fix significant amounts of nitrogen. The "D. senegalense" tree has two phases of fructification. Trees generally lose their leaves at the beginning of March and experience a renewal of leaves a few weeks later. After young leaves have developed, flowering occurs. As the fruits ripen, they develop a sweeter flavour and increased vitamin C content. Fruits reach full maturation from August–November depending on the climate of the region they are growing in. Trees are drought tolerant and have the ability to grow on infertile sites as they are relatively insensitive to soil, altitude, heat, and humidity. Their wood has good resistance to termites, pinhole borers, and marine bores; however, the wood is susceptible to "Lyctus" attack.
Consumption and uses.
Different parts of the "D. senegalense" tree are utilized for a variety of purposes. This species is mainly used for its medicinal properties. The bark of the tree is most widely used in medicine for remedies including: the removal of the placenta after birth and treatment of anaemia; wounds, skin problems, bronchitis, pneumonia, stomach ache and digestive disorders; tuberculosis, and in cases of heavy blood loss. Root decoctions are used to treat marasmus, debility, intestinal complaints, and convulsions. Leaf and shoot mixtures have been used in the treatment of dysentery, conjunctivitis, arthritis, fractures, and boils. Seeds have been effective in controlling blood-glucose levels in diabetic individuals, for the treatment of mosquito bites and as an antidote against arrow poison and snake bite. The “ofo” flour made from the seeds is often used as a soup thickener. Aside from being eaten directly, the pulp of the fruit can be made into sherbets, juices, marmalades, or dried like dates. The timber from the trees is referred to as “African mahogany” that is characterized by its dark reddish-brown shade. Though the wood is heavy, it is easy to work with due to its resistance to moisture, weathering, and pests such as termites and borers. It is primarily utilized in the construction of houses, fences, and boats, but also works efficiently as firewood as it lights well. "D. senegalense" trees are frequently employed in reforestation programs in areas of degraded land as they have the ability to grow on infertile soils.
Though there is limited information on the nutrient composition of the "D. senegalense" fruit, it appears to be a very healthful product. Per 100 g, sweet detar fruit contains 116 kcal energy, 1.9 g protein, 0.4 g fat, 29.6 g carbohydrates, 2.3 g fibre, 27 mg calcium, 48 mg phosphate, 0.14 mg thiamin and 0.05 mg riboflavin, 2.8 mg iron, 0.6 mg niacin, and, most notably, about 1200 mg vitamin C. In comparison to recommended daily vitamin and mineral requirements for an adult (in Canada), the fruit contains moderate amounts of thiamin and iron, an exceptional amount of vitamin C, and lesser quantities of the other vitamins and minerals measured. The fruit seeds are composed of approximately 12% protein, and are rich in rare amino acids lysine and tryptophan, and thus the “ofo” flour made from the seeds has an excellent amino acid composition. Leaves from the trees have demonstrated antiviral activity against a number of human and animal viruses and the bark has shown antibacterial activity against many pathogenic bacteria, justifying the medicinal properties of the plant.
Practical information.
Fruits such as sweet detar can contribute to successful interventions to improve local livelihoods as they are rich in nutrients, require minimal preparation, and have flavours that appeal to many tastes. Storing sweet detar at temperatures around 4 degrees Celsius will preserve its quality by limiting the loss of vitamin C. As the fruit goes bad, the coating will change to a brown-yellow colour. A sieve is useful for separating debris and the seed from the pulp of the fruit and a mortar and pestle work well for pureeing the pulp. Though some "D. senegalense" trees produce toxic fruits, these are often identifiable by the presence of fruits remaining under the trees. If left behind, the trees are likely toxic as animals are normally very quick to take the fruits. Propagation time can be decreased by grafting. For the "D. senegalense" tree, the apical graft is the most effective when employed at the end of the dry season. It is also important to work toward increasing the local dependency and appreciation of wild fruits when creating interventions as there are some traditional negative stigmas and beliefs concerning the consumption of wild fruits. Conflicts around ownership may arise if trees remain undomesticated. A potential solution is the adoption of salvation forestry, where local people produce local products in a manner that guarantees them a share in the yields.

Reading Prong

The Reading Prong is a physiographic subprovince of the New England Uplands section of the New England province of the Appalachian Highlands. The prong consists of mountains made up of crystalline metamorphic rock. 
Location.
The Reading Prong stretches from near Reading, Pennsylvania, through northern New Jersey and southern New York, reaching its northern terminus in Connecticut. In Pennsylvania, the Reading Prong is simply referred to as such, while in New Jersey and New York, the mountains of the subprovince are referred to as the New York – New Jersey Highlands. Near the Hudson Valley, the term Hudson Highlands is often used. The portion of the prong that enters Connecticut is known as the Housatonic Highlands.
Relation to other divisions of the New England Uplands.
There are two subsections of the New England Uplands in addition to the Reading Prong. A prong of the same rock belt extends from the Hudson Highlands south to New York City along the Hudson River. This region is often referred to as the Manhattan Prong. The Staten Island Sepentinite is also a southward extension of the New England Uplands.
Geology.
The Reading Prong is part of the Precambrian basement which is discontinuously exposed in the north-central Appalachians. The rocks that make up the prong consist of diverse gneisses. The New England Province and the Blue Ridge province share many geological similarities, and some experts consider the Reading Prong merely a continuation of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which reach their northern terminus at South Mountain near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania. In the gap between the Blue Ridge and the Reading Province, the two mountainous regions descend into the Appalachian Piedmont. Together, the Blue Ridge province and the New England province are often referred to as the Crystalline Appalachians. Rocks of the Reading Prong are characterized by elevated concentrations of uranium, the decay of which produces gaseous radon, a potentially hazardous source of indoor contamination in structures constructed on the prong.

Fleetwood is a Swedish Baronial family, number 49 on the Swedish Riddarhuset. The family is descended from Lancashire in England. The oldest member known by name is William Fleetwood, mentioned 1320, however, documented information about the family starts in the 16th century.
Thomas Fleetwood.
Thomas Fleetwood (1518-1570) originated from Heskin, Lancashire and purchased the manor of the Vache in Chalfont, Buckinghamshire in 1564. He was a member of parliament and a judge, and Master of the Royal Mint under King Henry VIII. He was granted the family's arms on 4 July 1548, which is still used by the family.
George Fleetwood, regicide and Cromwellian lord.
The Vache was inherited by Sir George Fleetwood who died December 1620. It passed to his son Charles Fleetwood (died 1628) the father of George Fleetwood, who inherited the estate on the death of his father. George fought for Parliament during the English Civil War, and was one of the commissioners for trial of Charles I. He held various offices during the Interregnum, including a seat in Cromwell's House of Lords but after the Restoration was found guilty of regicide and although he was spared execution, his estate of The Vache confiscated and given to the Duke of York. After serving a number of years in prison he may have emigrated to America.
Charles Fleetwood the parliamentary general.
Another grandson of Thomas Fleetwood, Sir Miles Fleetwood (1576–1640) of Aldwinckle in Northants was a knight and a member of parliament.
The third son of Sir Miles was Charles Fleetwood (c. 1618–1692), was a Parliamentary soldier and politician, Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1652–55, where he enforced the Cromwellian Settlement. At the Restoration he was included in the Act of Indemnity as among the twenty liable to penalties other than capital, and was finally incapacitated from holding any office of trust. His public career then closed, though he survived until 4 October 1692. He was buried in Bunhill Fields.
George Fleetwood a Swedish general and baron.
Another son of Sir Miles, Sir George Fleetwood (baptised 30 June 1605 in Cople, Bedfordshire, died 11 June 1667 in Jälunda, Gryt, Södermanland, Sweden) came into Swedish service in 1629, became colonel for a regiment he had recruited himself in England in 1630 and finally lieutenant-general. He was knighted 3 June 1632 by Charles I of England and created Swedish Baron 1 June 1654 at Uppsala Castle by Queen Christina of Sweden, and was introduced at Riddarhuset as a Swedish Baron 19 June 1654 as Baronial family N:o 49.

Ancient Roman military clothing

The legions of the Roman Republic and Empire wore fairly standardised dress and armour. However the concept of uniforms was not part of their culture and there were considerable differences in detail. Armor was not standardized and even that produced in state factories varied according to the province of origin. Likewise the Romans had no concept of obsolescence. Provided it remained serviceable, soldiers were free to use armour handed down by family members, buy armour from soldiers who had completed their service or wear discontinued styles of armour if they preferred it to (or could not afford) the latest issue. Thus it was common for legions to wear a mix of various styles that could cover a considerable time period.
Clothing may have been one of the most important aspects of a Roman Soldier's life, the majority of his time would have been spent in peace. In Germany before Arminius' attack on Varus, Roman soldiers were building towns, and the German people were adapting to Roman ways.
Fragments of surviving clothing and wall paintings indicate that the basic tunic of the Roman soldier was of red or undyed (off-white) wool. Senior commanders are known to have worn white cloaks and plumes. The centurions who made up the long serving backbone of the legions were distinguished by transverse crests on their helmets, chest ornaments corresponding to modern medals and the long cudgels that they carried. 
Examples of items of Roman military personal armour included:

Wesley Weber

Wesley Weber was a Canadian who succeeded in counterfeiting the Canadian hundred-dollar bill. Because of this, many stores stopped accepting $100 bills until the note was redesigned. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, they are the highest quality computer produced counterfeits of Canadian currency to date.
This was one reason that the 100 dollar bills were redesigned to make them more difficult to counterfeit. The Weber bill is still taught in police colleges as the prime test case for counterfeit.
Wesley Weber was a self-taught mastermind who had spent years tinkering with banknotes to perfect the simulated images and security features. These skills earned him a conviction for cheque forgery ring in 1997, and another for counterfeiting $10 and $20 bills since 1999. He was arrested in October 2000 for passing a counterfeit $100 at an auto parts supplier, but was released on bail a week later. He pled guilty in August 2001, and received a five-year prison sentence. Weber was released from jail in August 2006.

Edward Mayhew

Edward Mayhew (1569 – 14 September 1625) was an English Benedictine.
Life.
He belonged to the recusant family of Mayhew or Mayow of Winton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire. On 10 July 1583, he entered with his elder brother Henry, the English College at Reims, where he displayed conspicuous talents, and received the tonsure and minor orders on 22 August 1590. Moving to Rome, he there continued his studies until his ordination, after which he left for the English mission in 1595.
Having served for twelve years on the mission as a secular priest, he joined the Benedictine Order. He was professed by Dom Sigelbert Buckley, the sole survivor of the English congregation, in his cell at the Gatehouse prison, Westminster, on 21 November 1607, with Robert Sadler.
Under these two new members the English congregation began to revive. Becoming affiliated with the Spanish congregation in 1612, it was given an equal share in St. Lawrence's monastery at Dieulwart, Lorraine, henceforth the centre of the English congregation. Retiring from the English mission in 1613, Mayhew took up his residence at Dieulwart, where he filled the office of prior from 1613 to 1620.
The union of the three congregations engaged on the English missions had for some time been canvassed, in 1617 Mayhew was appointed one of the nine definitors to bring this about. That of the English and Spanish congregations was accomplished by the Apostolic Brief, "Ex incumbenti", of August, 1619, but the members of the Italian congregation refused to become united.
From 1623 until his death he acted as vicar to the nuns at Cambrai. His remains lie in the parish church at St-Vedast.
Works.
The most important of Mayhew's works are: *"Sacra Institutio Baptizandi etc." (Douai, 1604);

List of battles fought in Indiana

This is an incomplete list of all military confrontations that have occurred within the boundaries of the modern U.S. State of Indiana since European contact. The French first entered Indiana c. 1670. The region was part of New France from 1679–1763, ruled by Great Britain from 1763–1783, and part of the United States of American 1783–present.
There have been several wars that have directly affected the region, including Beaver Wars (c 1590–1701), Queen Anne's War (1702–1713), King George's War (1744–1748), French and Indian War (1754–1763), American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Northwest Indian War (1785–1795), Tecumseh's War (1811–1812), War of 1812 (1812–1814), and the American Civil War (1860–1865). Later wars, including World War I and World War II led to the death of tens of thousands of Hoosiers overseas, but the American Civil War was the last war in which an actual battle occurred within Indiana.

<doc id="18678051" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18678051" title="Habitancum">
Habitancum

Habitancum was an ancient Roman fort (castra) located at Risingham, Northumberland, England. The fort was one of the defensive structures built along Dere Street, a Roman road running from York to Corbridge and onwards to Melrose.
The forts name, "Habitancum", is mentioned in the Ravenna Cosmography, but not in the Notitia Dignitatum, or other sources. "Habitancum" is also the name on an altar set up by Marcus Gavius Secundinus a consular beneficiary on duty there.
Location.
The fort is situated north of Corbridge ("Coria") and south of Rochester ("Bremenium"), the next Roman fort on Dere Street. It is west of the A68 road between Corbridge and Jedburgh, where the road crosses the River Rede at the village of West Woodburn. At this point Dere Street deviates westwards of the A68 and rejoins it a mile or two further north.
Description.
The fort occupies a low mound overlooking the River Rede. It is oblong in shape and measures north to south, and east to west, giving an area of just over . It was surrounded by a number of ditches, which can still be seen on the south and west sides. 
The fort had gates in the south and west walls. There may have been gates in the other walls but no sign of them has been found. The walls were of sandstone ashlar, backed by a clay bank thirty feet thick.
At the end of the 2nd century the fort was either abandoned or destroyed when large numbers of Roman troops were withdrawn. Later, the fort was rebuilt by the First Cohort of Vangiones, one thousand strong.
Garrison.
The 2nd-century garrison is not known for certain, but may have been the Fourth Cohort of Gauls. The 3rd-century garrison was the First Cohort of Vangiones, as well as a Numerus Exploratorum (Unit of Scouts) and a detachment of Raeti Gaesati (pikemen).
Current site.
The only visible stone remains lie at the north-eastern corner angle, but the outlines of many buildings can easily be made out beneath a layer of turf in the fort’s interior, as can the ditches on all sides.

My Earth Dream

MyEarthDream is the sixth studio album by the Austrian Symphonic metal band Edenbridge. It is the first album by the band that was recorded with an orchestra, namely the Czech Film Orchestra. The music focuses on b-flat-tuned guitars and is darker and harder than the band's previous releases.
Reception.
The German edition of "Metal Hammer" as well as the "Sonic Seducer" praised the quality of the production. The former noted the participation of Karl Groom and Mika Jussila (Stratovarius, Avantasia) while the latter magazine called the "MyEarthDream" the most intense album that had so far been released by Edenbridge. About.com's reviewer wrote of "well crafted songs and good musicianship" and observed that the band was best when they stayed within the symphonic metal genre without drifting too far into power metal.

ELMO (protein)

ELMO (Engulfment and Cell Motility) is a family of related proteins (~82 kDa) involved in intracellular signalling networks. These proteins have no intrinsic catalytic activity and instead function as adaptors which can regulate the activity of other proteins through their ability to mediate protein-protein interactions.
This family contains three paralogous isoforms:
Structure and function.
The ELMO family are evolutionarily conserved orthologs of the "C. elegans" protein CED-12. All isoforms contain a series of armadillo repeats, which begin at the N-terminus and extend around two thirds of the way along the protein, as well as a C-terminal proline-rich motif and a central PH domain. They function as part of a protein complex with Dock180-related proteins to form a bipartite guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac (a member of the Rho family of small G proteins). The Dock180-ELMO interaction requires the ELMO PH domain and also involves binding of the ELMO proline-rich motif to the Dock180 SH3 domain.

Lindy Electronics

Lindy Electronics produces computer and audiovisual connectivity products. It sells through its own online and mail-order business and elsewhere. 
History.
In 1932, from a small apartment in Breslau, Germany, Kurt Lindenberg started a family business that was the beginning of the Lindy group.
He closed the business during the Second World War, but reopened it in 1947 in his new hometown of Mannheim. The business expanded from the petrol lamps and simple electrical appliances that it had sold in the early days, to follow the consumer demand for radios and televisions with the introduction of KUBA radio and TV furniture into the line.
In the 1960s the company begin to sell self-assembly radios and amplifiers from the Danish manufacturer Josty, and by 1970 Lindy sold mainly electronic components and equipment.
The Lindy logo, which is still used in similar form today, was created in the mid-1970s for the launch of a range of electronic games in conjunction with the Japanese company Gakken. Alongside these, the Lindy Electronic Station was the first product to be fully developed and designed in-house. 
As the home computer market grew in the 1980s, Lindy expanded into computer connectivity equipment such as cables and KVM Switches. The next decade saw a phase of international expansion, with offices opened in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Switzerland.
By 2000 the Lindy branch in the United Kingdom had outgrown its premises and work began on a new office and warehouse facility in Stockton-on-Tees that later became its UK headquarters. The group also opened offices in Australia, Ireland, and the United States.

Gunnar Geisse

Gunnar Geisse (born July 11, 1964, Giessen, Germany) is a musician, improviser, composer, and interpreter. He moves along the cutting edge between experimental/improvised music and new music. He has developed a complex instrumental concept combining guitar and electronics/computer which he calls laptop guitar. He also plays several other string instruments including banjo, mandolin, and a variety of instruments from Central Asia, among them the Uzbek and the Persian dotâr. Gunnar Geisse has been living in Munich, Germany since 1985.
Musical career.
Gunnar Geisse began his career in his early youth as a rock guitarist. With the end of his schooling he gravitated in the direction of jazz. Attending an Ornette Coleman concert at the Moers Jazz Festival in Germany, he saw Coleman carried onto the stage in a coffin, jump out dressed in a glittering disco outfit and play in the free jazz style that he helped create. After this key experience, Geisse bought toy plastic saxophones for the members of his band and threw away his original plan to play jazz standards. It was during this time that improvisation and an experimental approach became the foundation of his understanding of music. His first professional engagement was with the "New York Broadway Ensemble" with which he toured throughout Europe for the next two years. For Geisse, to be a part of an orchestra was an essential learning experience.
The avant-garde combo "Brother Virus" which along with Geisse included Werner Klausnitzer, Patrick Scales, and Maurice de Martin, achieved fame at the end of the 1980s. It would leave a major impression on Geisse. The band was invited to play at the Knitting Factory in New York, and was one of the first bands to play serious improvised music "live" on prime time German TV – Dagobert Lindlau's "Veranda". With "Brother Virus" Gunnar Geisse took the first steps on his own musical journey, a journey that was already apparent in his earlier development. In 1991 Enja Records released the "Brother Virus" album "Happy Hour".
Geisse lost the two middle fingers on his right hand in a mountain climbing accident in 1992. With the severity of the injury and subsequent operations, it was unclear as to whether Geisse would be able to continue his playing career. It was during his hospital stays that he was able to contemplate the implications of 20th century new music compositional techniques, and in so doing discovered his deep interest in structure. He wrote his first composition during one of his hospital stays. For him to have a good aural understanding of the piece, he proceeded to overdub the tracks – some 200 in total. Out of his interest in structure, Geisse worked together with the Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Magdeburg in the area of complexity theory, non-linear phenomena and simulation, and inserted structural models of nature into his music. The recording was released under the title "AtEM".
While judging a music composition competition, Hans Zender - conductor of the SWR symphony orchestra und professor for composition at the College of Music and Arts in Frankfurt, Germany - took notice of Geisse's extraordinary music. Subsequently Gunnar Geisse received a stipend to compose at the prestigious Schloss Solitude Academy for one year. It was at Solitude that he composed "Das diskrete Jetzt" (The Discrete Now). He delved deeper into the phenomena of musical time. On a renewed search for natural structural references, he received important suggestions and impetus from the Institute for Medical Psychology at the Ludwig-Maximilian University (LMU) in Munich on the theme "time and its perception". The classic compositional parameters of tempo, meter, and rhythm are pushed into the background by this broadening of perspective through a psychological perception of time.
After his work with structure and time Gunnar Geisse again delved into questions concerning the fundamental functions of harmony. Searching for answers within nature since 2003, he has occupied himself with the non-linear phenomena of combination-tones - these are tones that are formed in the cochlea of the inner ear as an extension of the original acoustic signal. The combination-tones are the missing building blocks which, when added to his use of partial-tone rows and partial-tone matrixes, complete Geisse's set of harmonic compositional tools. The results of this work can be heard on the CD "MEtA" (Creative Sources Recordings). In 2006 Geisse wrote an exposition which lends insight into his specific harmonic concept.
Paradoxically, with these compositional tonal explorations, sound-based improvisation and its physical, expressive moments have taken on more and more importance; Geisse's improvisational models have changed under these influences. Since 2005 working with electronics and laptop computers have become an important means of expression for Geisse. In this context he has developed a unique hardware/software set-up (laptop guitar) that allows him to pursue his analogue playing (guitar) on a digital level, and even more importantly, to break away from the restrictions of "instrument" in order to work more directly with sound and its formulation.
Gunnar Geisse has received various awards and stipends, including the Musical Achievement Award of the City of Munich, and the Schloss Solitude Academy's Composition Stipend.
Musical Collaborations.
Gunnar Geisse has played with musicians from the three major areas of his musical life: experimental/improvised music, new music, and contemporary jazz. They include:
Richard Barrett, Marty Cook, Phil Durrant, Vinko Globokar, Barry Guy, Franz Hautzinger, Jason Kahn, Thomas Lehn, Michael Lentz, George Lewis, David Moss, Günter Müller, Olga Neuwirth, Phill Niblock, Evan Parker, Giancarlo Schiaffini, Ignaz Schick, Ed Schuller, Mike Svoboda, Gary Thomas, Wu Wei, Xu Fengxia.
Gunnar Geisse has worked with or played works of Hans-Jürgen von Bose, John Cage, Peter Maxwell Davies, Fred Frith, Gérard Grisey, Hans Werner Henze, Tom Johnson, Helmut Lachenmann, Anestis Logothetis, Chico Mello, Josef Anton Riedl, Gioacchino Rossini, Dieter Schnebel, James Tenney, Kurt Weill, Jörg Widmann, Christian Wolff, and Udo Zimmermann.
He has also played as soloist under the direction of Stefan Asbury, Paul Daniel, Peter Eötvös, Franck Ollu, and Lothar Zagrosek with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (BR), The Bavarian State Opera Orchestra, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (SWR), the Stuttgart City Orchestra, and the Munich City Theatre Orchestra on Gärtnerplatz.
Gunnar Geisse was/is a member of the following ensembles: Brother Virus, le petit chien, ICI ensemble, Go Guitars, Berlin Jazz Composers Ensemble, Fractal Gumbo, NIE Quartett

Henri and Jules Desclée

Henri Desclée (1830-1917) and Jules Desclée (July 9, 1828-August 2, 1911) were Belgian brothers, known as founders of Maredsous Abbey, and of a printing business for Roman Catholic literature.
Maredsous Abbey.
The brothers chose a picturesque site on an estate of Henri Desclée's in the Province of Namur, for the erection of Maredsous. a monastery in which to establish the monks of Beuron Abbey. They were among the religious orders which were driven out of Germany by the "Kulturkampf" and sought refuge in Catholic Belgium. With Dom Hildebrand de Hemptinne, a Belgian monk of that congregation (later Abbot Primate of the Benedictine Order), Jules Desclée had been a captain of the Pontifical Zouaves. Baron John Béthune, inspired by the same motive as the Desclée brothers for the restoration of Christian art, had attached his school of St. Luke to the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. Moreover, a Count de Hemptinne had been amongst the founders of the first school of St. Luke (1862). 
Accordingly the monastery of Maredsous was constructed in the purest Gothic style of the thirteenth century, after the plans of Baron Béthune.
Publishing.
In the 1870s the Desclée brothers also founded an important printing establishment at Tournai, under the title of the Society of St. John the Evangelist, their object being to restore Christian art in liturgical publications. The aesthetic principles by which their enterprise was to be directed were those of the Middle Ages. Here also Baron John Béthune assisted them. 
At first the society relied on English workmen, compositors, and printers. The first publications attracted the attention of connoisseurs. The Society, following first the work of the Rev. Dom Pothier, and afterwards the studies of the Benedictines of Solesmes, issued the first publications for the re-establishment of the liturgical chant, commonly called "plain chant". These editions served as a basis for the edition brought out by the Vatican printing press, and imposed by Pope Pius X on the Catholic Church. 
About 1880 the Desclée brothers resolved to apply to other branches of Catholic literature the same principles of artistic restoration which had met with such success in the liturgical domain. Under the title of the Society of St. Augustine they founded a separate business, devoted to the publication of all kinds of books relating to ecclesiastical studies, ascetic theology, religious history and literature, hagiography, art, archaeology, education, etc. The production of religious images formed also an important part of the work of the society, at Bruges in Belgium, and at Lille in France.
In 1881 the Desclée brothers took over the production of the "Revue de l'art chrétien."

Rachel Getting Married

Rachel Getting Married is a 2008 drama film directed by Jonathan Demme, and starring Anne Hathaway, Rosemarie DeWitt, Bill Irwin and Debra Winger. The film was released in the U.S. to select theaters on October 3, 2008. The film opened the 65th Venice International Film Festival. The film also opened in Canada's Toronto Film Festival on September 6, 2008. Hathaway received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her performance in the film.
Plot.
Kym (Anne Hathaway) is released from drug rehab for a few days so she can go home to attend the wedding of her sister Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt). At home, the atmosphere is strained between Kym and her family members as they struggle to reconcile themselves with her past and present. Kym's father (Bill Irwin) shows intense concern for her well-being and whereabouts, which Kym interprets as mistrust. She also resents her sister's choice of her best friend Emma (Anisa George), rather than Kym, to be her maid of honor. Rachel, for her part, resents the attention her sister's drug addiction is drawing away from her wedding, a resentment that comes to a head at the rehearsal dinner, where Kym, amid toasts from friends and family, takes the microphone to offer an apology for her past actions, as part of her twelve-step program.
Underlying the family's dynamic is a tragedy that occurred years previously, which Kym retells at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. As a teenager, Kym was responsible for the death of her young brother Ethan, who was left in her care one day; driving home from a nearby park, an intoxicated Kym had lost control of the car, driving over a bridge and into a lake, where her brother drowned.
The day before the wedding, as Rachel, Kym, and the other bridesmaids are getting their hair done, Kym is approached by a man whom she knew from an earlier stint in rehab. He thanks her for the strength she gave him through a story about having been molested by an uncle and having cared for her sister, who was anorexic. Rachel, hearing this, storms out of the hair salon. The story, it turns out, was all a lie — an apparent attempt by Kym to evade responsibility for her addiction.
The tension between the sisters comes to a head later that night at their father's house, when Kym comes home. Rachel reveals she has never forgiven Kym for their brother's death, and now makes the point that Kym's rehab has been a hoax since she has been lying about the cause of her problems. Kym finally admits responsibility for Ethan's death and reveals that she had been relapsing in order to cope. She gets into her father's car and leaves.
Kym heads to the home of their mother Abby (Debra Winger), hoping to find solace with her. However, a fight breaks out between them, when Kym asks Abby why she left Ethan in her care on the night of his death despite knowing that she was often on drugs. She makes the point on how better off it would've been if she had left him in Rachel's care. Abby tells Kym she left Ethan with her because "you were good with him" and that she thinks her sister is a hypocrite for her accusations. When Kym makes it clear she thinks her mother's decision was in part responsible for Ethan's death, Abby becomes furious and punches Kym in the face. Kym hits her mother back and drives off in her father's car. While driving away, Kym begins sobbing uncontrollably because in her mind, she feels Abby has not accepted appropriate responsibility for her part in the actions which ultimately caused Ethan's death. Kym drives the car off the road and crashes into a boulder. Rather than summon help, she spends the night in the car while everyone at home worries about what has become of her.
The next morning, the day of the wedding, Kym is spotted in the car by passing joggers, who call police. The police awaken her and give her a sobriety test, which she passes. She gets a ride home with the driver of the tow truck who is towing the wrecked car. She makes her way to Rachel's room, as Rachel prepares for the wedding. Seeing Kym's bruised face from a fight she had with their mother prompts her anger of the previous night to vanish, and Rachel tenderly bathes and dresses her sister.
Amid a festive Indian theme, Rachel and her fiancee are wed. Kym is the maid of honor, and is overcome with emotion as the couple exchanges their vows. Kym tries to enjoy herself throughout the wedding reception but continues to feel out of place and is nagged by the unresolved dispute with her mother. Ultimately, her mother leaves the party early, despite Rachel's effort to bring the two together, and the gulf between Kym and Abby is left unreconciled - suggesting Abby's emotional distance and unwillingness is the root cause of the family's problems.
The next morning, Kym must return to rehab. As she is leaving, Rachel runs out of the house to hug her.
Production.
The screenplay was written by Jenny Lumet, the daughter of director Sidney Lumet and granddaughter of Lena Horne. Lumet, a junior high school drama teacher, has written four earlier screenplays, but this was the first to be produced. The film is directed by Jonathan Demme, and was shot in Stamford, Connecticut in a naturalistic style. The working title for the film was originally "Dancing with Shiva".
Sidney Lumet himself approached Demme about his daughter Jenny's script. Demme has commented that he loved Jenny's flagrant disregard for the rules of formula, her lack of concern for making her characters likable in the conventional sense, and for what he considered to be her bold approach to truth, pain, and humor.
Filming took 33 days and occurred in late 2007.
Cast.
Casting.
Demme had wanted to work with Anne Hathaway ever since he spotted her in a crowd at a screening five years earlier. He immediately took her in consideration for the lead role. Hathaway later said of her first reading Lumet's script: "I was in my old apartment in the West Village Manhattan, just pacing back and forth between the kitchen table and the couch. I somehow wound up on the floor sobbing by the last page."
Rosemarie DeWitt was considered by the film's casting directors. Demme and the rest of the crew were impressed and immediately wanted her to play Rachel. Bill Irwin is a personal friend of Demme's.
Tunde Adebimpe's role, Sidney, was originally offered to American film director Paul Thomas Anderson while he was working on the post-production of the movie "There Will Be Blood".
Demme was concerned about Debra Winger's interest in doing the film, but he pumped up his courage to ask her because they had met several times before at the Jacob Burns Center, a film center close to their homes. Winger later accepted the role of Abby.
Reception.
Critical response.
The film received critical acclaim and appeared on many "Best Film of 2008" lists. Michael Phillips of the "Chicago Tribune" called the film "a triumph of ambience," and that Hathaway, DeWitt, Irwin and especially Winger are working at a very high level. Roger Ebert's four-star rating added, "apart from the story, which is interesting enough, 'Rachel Getting Married' is like the theme music for an evolving new age." Other critics praised Jonathan Demme. Andrew Sarris noted in the "New York Observer" "his career of cinematic good works" and Owen Gleiberman of "Entertainment Weekly" observed "a fight scene that's as raw as Ingmar Bergman and as operatic as Mildred Pierce" . . . and "Demme's finest work since "The Silence of the Lambs".
Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" noted that "Rachel Getting Married" is "a home run… goes deep into the joy and pain of being human." A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" said that the film "has an undeniable and authentic vitality, an exuberance of spirit, that feels welcome and rare".
Many reviewers praised the film for its organic feel; "Salon" reviewer Stephanie Zacharek noted that "with 'Rachel Getting Married,' Demme has once again scaled back, making a picture that has some of the ease and warmth of his earlier movies, although it also feels stripped down and direct in a way that's new for Demme." "USA Today" proclaimed: "After a foray in documentary films, director Jonathan Demme has returned to narrative storytelling, assuming a decidedly cinéma vérité style that has echoes of Robert Altman. The film's greatest asset is the sense of cringing realism in portraying dinner parties and interpersonal encounters that can throw family members off-kilter." The "Los Angeles Times" noted:
Anne Hathaway won raves for her work as Kym. "USA Today" found her wonderful in the role and wrote "Her nervous laughter, edginess and quick temper blend convincingly with her need for attention and vulnerability." "Newsweek" commented: "Kym is a major pain in the ass, and Hathaway's raw, spiky performance makes no attempt to ingratiate. Yet she makes Kym's inner torment so palpable you can't help but feel for her, however insufferable she may be. It's a terrific performance…". "Empire" felt that "Kym is a peach of a role—she sleeps with the best man, fights with the maid of honor, quips, 'You're so thin, it's like you're Asian'—and Hathaway squeezes it for all the juice it's worth, making this raw-nerved, narcissistic Tasmanian Devil not just believable, but somehow likable." 
, the film holds an overall 85 percent rating at Rotten Tomatoes
Top ten lists.
The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.
Music.
The music-loving director Demme invited musicians to compose the score live on set, to support the film's storyline.
"For the longest time," Demme has said, "I've had this desire to provide the musical dimension of a movie without traditionally scored music. I thought: wait a minute; in the script, Paul of the bride is a music-industry bigwig, Sidney's a record producer, many of his friends will be gifted musicians, so of course there would be non-stop music at this gathering. We have music playing live throughout the weekend, but always in the next room, out on the porch or in the garden."
Throughout the unconventional filming and loosely staged scenes, a New York–based Middle Eastern ensemble, including the Palestinian musician Zafer Tawil, and Iraqi Amir ElSaffar, who played the score of Demme's documentary "Man from Plains", compose the score on set. Always present at the filming, the musicians had the freedom – and were encouraged – to play whenever they were inspired to, and to ignore the camera.
According to Demme on the DVD, during filming of a dramatic scene, Hathaway complained about the music interfering with the mood, to which Demme responded "Tell her to do something about it!" Hathaway, in that scene, responded by improvising the line, "Can you tell them to knock it off?!" to which another actor not heavily involved in the scene went off-screen and told the band to stop.
Well-known acting faces mingle anonymously on-screen with musicians, artists, dancers and acting-novice friends of the director. Among them are the New Orleanian saxophonist Donald Harrison Jr., and the Brooklyn-based TV on the Radio's lead singer Tunde Adebimpe.
Singer-songwriter Robyn Hitchcock plays a wedding guest. At the ceremony Hitchcock, at the request of his old friend Demme, performs the song "America" from his 1982 album "Groovy Decay". He also plays "Up To Our Nex", written for the movie. "It's my micro-encapsulation of the movie. The song is trying to be a voice in Kym's head . . . " Filmed in one take at the wedding party, he is spontaneously joined by the hip-hop star Fab 5 Freddy, and the dancehall singers Sister Carol, ElSaffar and Tawil.
Hitchcock recalled,
For Demme, it was about creating evocative music in the moment.

Career.
Stockport County.
Born in Salford, Mainwaring, came through Preston North End's Centre of Excellence youth system before signing a 12-month contract with Stockport in June 2008. This was with the intention of being part of the development squad while trying to establish himself in Stockport's first team by the end of the season.
He made his debut for the club on 30 August 2008, coming on as a substitute in a 0–3 defeat against Scunthorpe United. Hard work in the development squad was rewarded with a string of full first-team games in late January 2009, and Mainwaring scored his first professional goal in a 4–1 victory over Hereford United on 31 January 2009. Despite playing on the left wing throughout his youth career, he has preferred playing in central midfield for Stockport.

Mainwaring was injured in a friendly pre-season match against Grimsby Town on 25 July 2009, spelled a lengthy period out of the matchday squad, being out of action for 5 months with a broken leg, in January 2010 he told the "Stockport Express" "I've been out for five months and I'm desperate to get back. I'm not back in training yet but I'm doing a lot of running and strength work and I've been doing a lot of exercises to build up my calf muscle. In September 2011 he was released by the club by mutual consent having not featured in the team for the 2011–12 season.
Hull City and Stockport return.
He went on trial with Hull City in November 2011 and subsequently signed a contract with the club in January 2012. But he returned to former club Stockport County on loan. He stayed at the club until April 2012 and was subsequently released by Hull.

Hyde.
On 3 August 2013, he signed for Conference Premier side Hyde following Stockport's relegation to the Conference North. He made his debut for Hyde on 24 August 2013, in a 2–2 drawe away at Wrexham. On 28 November, he went on a month's loan to Conference Premier rivals Macclesfield Town. 
International career.

Personal life.
In 2004, mainwaring won the chance to appear on the Children's TV show, 'Really Bend it Like Beckham' where he appeared as a young "hotshot". He got the chance to meet at-the-time Manchester United player David Beckham.
Speaking after the programme in 2004, David Beckham said: "What I think impressed me about Matthew was when he was up against another of the hotshots Mollie, he was giving her a little bit of a chance, whereas some young kids wouldn't care. They just want to do their best and go straight through whether it's a girl or a boy. But that's what impressed me, he was a caring person. He was congratulating Mollie and saying well done to her. That's what I realised and recognised throughout the day ... and he's a great talent of course."

Structure of the stage in bunraku

The musician’s stage-Yuka
This is the auxiliary stage upon which the gidayu-bushi is performed. It thrusts out into the audience area at the front right portion of the seats. Upon this auxiliary stage there is a special revolving platform. It is upon this revolving platform that the chanter and the shamisen player make their appearance, and, when they are finished, it turns once more, bringing them backstage and placing the next performers on the stage.
The partitions (Tesuri) and the pit (Funazoko)
Between extreme upstage and extreme downstage, there are three stage partitions, known as "railings" (tesuri). The area behind the second partition is called the pit (funazoko; lit., "ship bottom"), and it is where the manipulators stand. It is one step lower than the main stage. When the puppets move, their feet move along the railings, making it look as though they are actually walking upon the ground. The building (yatai) or painted backdrop (kakiwari) is attached to the partition farthest from the audience (main railing).
Small curtain (Komaku) and Screened-off Rooms (Misuuchi) 
Looking at the stage from the audience, the right-hand side is called kamite (stage left), while the left-hand side is called shimote (stage right). The puppets make their appearance and then leave the stage through the small black curtains (komaku) at both stage left and stage right. The screened-off rooms are just above the small curtains, and they have bamboo blinds set up so that the audience cannot see inside. In the screened-off room at stage left (the audience's right), are young chanters and shamisen players of limited experience. In that on the opposite side, are the members of the hayashi (orchestra), who perform on such instruments as flutes, stick drums, hand drums, and bells, and even evoke the atmosphere of the scene by creating such sounds as wind, rain, and the flowing of a river.

Andrés de Santa María

Andrés de Santa María, (December 16, 1860 - April 29, 1945) was a Colombian painter from Bogotá. His work was mostly impressionist in nature.
Biography.
Santa Maria was born in Bogota on December 16 1860. In his childhood he spent two years in England. 
In 1882 entered the School of Fine Arts in Paris, where he studied under Fernando Humberto and Enrique Gervex, and worked alongside Ignacio Zuluaga, Santiago Rusiñol and the Prince Eugene of Sweden. In 1889 he painted the picture of Matías de Francisco for the Bank of Bogota, and in this year also painted Lavadoras del Sena. From 1893 he made many trips back and forth to Europe where he made a notable exhibition in Bogota in 1897 before returning to Europe.
In 1904 however, he was invited by the president of the republic, general Rafael Reyes, to perform an exhibition with the writers Sanín Cano, Hinestroza Daza and Max Grillo. Until 1911 he was director of the School of Fine Arts in Bogota. In 1906 he painted the triptych of the National Capital, in this represented Simon Bolivar directing the liberation campaign. On finishing his work as director of the School of Beautiful Arts, he returned again to Europe and settled in Brussels.
In 1936, he received much acclaim from his exhibition at the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels . In 1937 he made a retrospective exhibition in the Burlington Gallery in London, displaying 125 paintings made over a 30 year period from 1907.
Style and legacy.
Santa Maria's work was in essence, impressionist in character and his work had an impact on modern painting in Colombia. Sometimes, this impressionism however would take passage to postimpressionist and other influences. He influenced the work of later artists such as Fídolo Alfonso González Camargo and Roberto Páramo. In Latin America, one can draw parallels of his work with the Venezuelan Armando Reverón and the Uruguayan Pedro Figari. The greatest collection of his works amounting to some 30 oil paintings is conserved by the National Museum of Colombia in Bogota. The museum owns emblematic pieces such as "En la Playa de Macuto" (Ca. 1907). His other works are in museums such as Colección de Arte del Banco de la República, the Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango, Museo de Arte Moderno de Bogotá and the Museo de Antioquia in Medellín, Antioquia.
He died in 1945.

1958–59 Cincinnati Royals season

The 1958-59 Cincinnati Royals season is arguably the most difficult ever faced by an NBA team in the league's history. The reason was the tragic career-ending head injury to star Maurice Stokes, who became permanently hospitalized at the age of 24 at the end of the previous season, which had been the team's first in Cincinnati. The loss of Stokes shocked six other roster players into retirement. Also, the team had been sold to new inexperienced local ownership and also soon had to replace their coach. No NBA team was ever so suddenly decimated.
Fortunately, star shooter Jack Twyman returned for the club as the only returning from a year ago. Had Twyman accepted other offers that year, the team would have likely folded.
St. Louis owner Ben Kerner, a long-time friend of previous owners Les and Jack Harrison, agreed to help the club. He sent five players to the Royals in return for All-Pro Clyde Lovellette and the rights to talented Si Green. The result was a diluted roster of rookies and journeymen.
Two rookies were burly 6' 8 big man Wayne Embry and 6' 4 defender Arlen ' Bucky ' Bockhorn. Both had to make the team before being offered contracts, and both were pleasant surprises to the beleaguered team.
Twyman was far and away the team's only star. He scored 25.8 points per game, trying more shots than any player in the league for his new team. The slender 6'6 star also led the Royals in rebounds, and came within 16 assists of leading the team there as well. More than that, he mentored the new players and also carried on Maurice Stokes charity causes off the court. He achieved a kind of fame, respect and notoriety unlike any NBA player ever. One of his creations to pay for his fallen teammates soaring hospital bills was The Maurice Stokes Charity Game, which was played at Kutcher's resort in Monticello, New York every August. A slew of NBA notables came to play in the event for Stokes ever year.
Despite Twyman's starring play, the Royals sank to 19-53 this season after contending much of the previous year. To limit over-exposure of a bad product at home, some 17 home games were played elsewhere this season. Several times that year, the team failed to draw 2000 fans to Cincinnati Gardens.
Somehow, the new ownership made it through the season and vowed to carry on. The NBA was of some help, granting territorial draft picks to Oscar Robertson and Ralph Davis from the local University of Cincinnati, as well as local high school phenom Jerry Lucas.

<doc id="18678341" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18678341" title="Red Brick School (Franklin, Massachusetts)">
Red Brick School (Franklin, Massachusetts)

Red Brick School is a historic school in Franklin, Massachusetts. It is one of the longest running one-room schools in America.
History.
The first school building on this site was a wooden one constructed after the Rev. Nathanael Emmons took a 900 year lease on the land. The school was built at the corner of Maple Street and Main Street, although the latter is now called 
Lincoln street and the school building is number two. The "Meeting House School" building and the 900 year lease were taken over by the town authorities. At this time it was known as the "school at the crossroads", although it was also used on Sundays by the Congregational church for their children's instruction and education. The early basis of the school was strong. In 1792 it was agreed that no school master should be appointed who did not "promise to pray in the school each day.
The red bricks.
The bricks that gave their name to this school building were shipped via oxen from Boston. This school was built on the foundation of the older, wooden schoolhouse in 1833. By 1835 Mortimer Blake was running a high school in the building that was proving so popular that it was overflowing despite the charges of 25 to 35 cents per week. They had to move the lessons to larger premises.
In 1852 the church stopped having Sunday school at the same building.
The administration had attempted to shut down the school during the Great Depression, due to its costs, but the townspeople rallied behind it. The school again almost closed in 1959, when it was declared unsafe, but the town of Franklin's residents paid to have it refurbished. The building was added to the National Historic Register in 1976.
Public School Tradition Continues.
In 2008, after 175 years of yearly use, the Red Brick School, which was serving as a kindergarten for Franklin's Public School System, was deemed to be "surplus" by the Franklin School Department. The school committee voted to close the school and turned the Red Brick School over to the control of the Town Of Franklin.
The town, with community support, worked closely with the Benjamin Franklin Classical Charter Public School to incorporate the little Brick School into their educational offerings. Today the tradition of public education continues in this one room classroom, viewed my many as a town treasure.
Dispute over Record.
The Town of Franklin claimed that the Red Brick School was the longest continuously-running one-room brick school house providing public education in the nation. That record was disputed by several members of Franklin's community when the decision on whether or not to close the school was being weighed by Franklin's School Committee. A town employee and public school parent uncovered, during an internet search, that the town of Croydon, New Hampshire, also had a "one room school house" whose building is fifty years older than the Red Brick School. The discussion that ensued, centered over whether the term "one room" meant class space, or actual rooms. In the Croydon schoolhouse there were actually two rooms, one used today as a classroom and the other used as extra space, holding a table, a counter, cabinets, and a copy machine.
The school department established a task force to study all the issues surrounding the school and to answer the questions raised by the debate. The task force report addresses the Croydon School House and can be found on the town of Franklin's website.

José Manuel de Goyeneche, 1st Count of Guaqui

José Manuel de Goyeneche y Barreda (Arequipa, Viceroyalty of Peru, June 12, 1776 - Madrid, October 10, 1846) was a Spanish soldier and diplomat.
Early life.
His father was captain of cavalry Juan de Goyeneche y Aguerrevere and his mother was María Josefa de Barreda y Benavides, daughter of field marshal Don Nicolás de Barreda y Ovando, from a noble family of military men and conquistadors. He travelled when very young to Spain, to finish his studies, and entered the army as cadet, later raising to lieutenant of cavalry and captain of grenadiers. He took part of the defense of Cádiz against the British in two occasions, having been in command of two hundred grenadiers and two gun batteries in the second.
Representative to the Supreme Junta.
In 1808, during the French invasion of the Iberian peninsula, he was commissioned as representative of the legitimate government of Spain to the Supreme Junta in Seville with the rank of brigadier, for the proclamation of king Ferdinand VII in the viceroyalties of Peru and River Plate, to ensure the fidelity and compliance of those colonies to the legitimate Spanish king, take the news of the general revolt against French invasion of Spain and ask of help from the colonies. His powers were vast, including firing and incarcerating anybody in public office (including viceroys) who manifested any opposission to Ferdinand VII, legitimate King of Spain.
War in Upper Peru.
He travelled to Peru, where viceroy Abascal named him Captain General and president of the Real Audiencia of Cusco. In 1809 he took command of the Peruvian royalist armies in Upper Peru, sent to suppress the revolutionary forces at La Paz, even though this province belonged the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. He defeated those forces and ordered the execution of a dozen of their leaders, then returned to Cusco.
After receiving news of the May Revolution in Buenos Aires, Viceroy Abascal announced the incorporation of Upper Peru (present-day Bolivia) to the Viceroyalty of Peru. General Goyeneche organized new forces, but did not advanced South until after the Battle of Suipacha, which left the region under control of the revolutionaries. In May 1811 he signed an armistice with the political leader of the independentist army Juan José Castelli, even though events betrayed that neither one was intending to abide by it. Castelli deployed part of his troops to try to surround Goyeneche's forces but Goyeneche employed his time better and attacked first. The ensuing battle of Huaqui on June 20, 1811 was a decisive victory for Goyeneche.
In a few weeks afterwards he occupied the whole of Upper Peru, including the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Potosí, re-establishing Spanish control over the territory. His decisive victory at the Battle of Huaqui earned him the title of "Count of Guaqui".
The rebellion at Cochabamba took a year to suppress which delayed his invasion of the Salta Province, in present-day northern Argentina. After defeating the tough resistance of the Cochabamba locas, including women fighters he entered the city and repressed the rebel with severity which cost the lives of dozens of men, women and children.
In 1813, general Pío de Tristán, under orders from Goyeneche, chased the Army of the River Plate South to Argentine territory. Tristán attacked the Belgrano's Army of the North and was defeated at the Battle of Tucumán. A few months later, Tristán defeated again at the Battle of Salta, falling prisoner along with his whole army. Goyeneche's armies were left unprotected in their southern flank, which forced him to retreat towards Oruro. Goyeneche resigned as commander in chief and was substituted by Joaquín de la Pezuela, returning to Spain shortly afterwards.
Return to Spain.
Upon returning to Spain, he was named Lieutenant General of the Royal Armies, member of the Junta for the Wars in the Indies, member of the War Council and president of the Junta for Overseas Commerce. He was also elected as deputy to the Cortes for Arequipa and senator of the realm for the Province of Canarias. King Ferdinand made him a peer, and also Knight of the Military Order of Santiago.
He died in Madrid in 1846. His remains are interred in the family crypt at the San Isidro cemetery in the Spanish capital.

Ishar Singh (poet)

Ishar Singh ‘Ishar’ (1892–1966) was one of the most renowned Punjabi humorous poets of the 20th century.
His poems centred around his comic creation ‘Bhaiya’, who was used as a vehicle for biting satirical comment on all aspects of Indian society and culture. Ishar Singh’s compositions were delivered in his native language – the particular form of Punjabi spoken in the Potwar region, which is now part of Pakistan. A tall, bespectacled Sikh, he published at least 12 poetic collections involving Bhaiya. But he lived in a time and place where culture was primarily transmitted by oral means, and where poetry was one of the chief forms of public entertainment. So it was in the mass public recitals – or ‘kavi darbars’ – that his works were most keenly and widely appreciated.
Early life and career.
Ishar Singh was born on 12 December 1892 in Kaneti, near Rawalpindi, in the Potwar plateau of the Punjab. The area was then part of British India, but is now in Pakistan.
He was the younger of two sons of Dhera Singh 'Shah', a wealthy money lender. But he showed no interest in money himself, instead displaying a prodigious early aptitude for poetry while studying at Sukho Khalsa High School. He was aged just 13 when his first poetic collection, "Naurangiya Alum", was published locally by his headmaster. At 16 he moved to study at the prestigious Khalsa College in Amritsar, where he recited his religious poems every week in the gurdwaras of Sikhism's holiest city.
He was married at 17 and moved to Karachi three years later to take his first job, a clerical role in the Post Office. This marked the beginning of a long career in the service, which he would combine with his ever burgeoning literary success.
From Karachi he transferred to Lahore, considered the hub of Punjabi poetry, before moving on to work as a postmaster in his home district of Rawalpindi.
All the while he wrote poetry in his spare time, publishing his works in local journals and reading them out at public functions. These earlier compositions were serious in tone, usually on religious matters. He also composed romantic and melancholic works, which he was to later look back on with embarrassment.
It was not until 1928 that he finally realised his true talent – which was to make people laugh. It was in that year that he entered a competition held by Charan Singh Shahid, editor of the weekly satirical journal Mauji, inviting humorous poems on the subject of "Fashiondaar Vauti" (Fashionable Wife). Ishar Singh beat 69 other entrants - many of greater fame - to the first prize of two sovereigns. The award marked a turning point in his life, highlighting fresh possibilities beyond the Post Office, and from then onwards his poems always looked to the lighter side of life.
Poems.
Although intended to create laughter, Ishar Singh’s compositions were not simply a form of idle and frivolous entertainment. Rather, they were intended as a satire on common social, cultural and religious values.
Ishar Singh used his piercing wit to puncture the pomposity of the rich and powerful, and to expose popular prejudices and injustices, many of which had been entrenched in the Indian psyche for centuries.
His acute observations touched on every aspect of life, from the minutiae of family relationships to matters of grand theology. No subject was taboo for him, and many of his pronouncements might be considered too close to the bone in today’s more politically correct age.
His creation ‘Bhaiya’ was the medium through which Ishar Singh attacked the various hypocrisies, superstitions and other absurdities he observed around him. Bhaiya was used in various guises - sometimes as himself, sometimes as his father or any other character - depending on the subject matter.
In total, Ishar Singh is thought to have composed over 2,500 poems, of which several hundred featured in 12 published collections: "Bhaiya"; "Rangila Bhaiya"; "Nirala Bhaiya"; "Nava Bhaiya"; "Gurmukh Bhaiya"; "Bhaiya Tilak Piya"; "Bhaiya Vaid Rogian Da"; "Premi Bhaiya"; "Desh Bhagat Bhaiya"; "Mastana Bhaiya"; "Hansmukh Bhaiya" and "Oncemore Bhaiya".
Although many of the poems in these books were written years, or even decades, earlier, most were not published until the last few years of his life. Indeed, it was only after retiring from the Post office in 1954 that Ishar Singh attained truly widespread fame.
As late as 1955, when he had already published five books, he complained that his works were being denied a proper audience. He described how he had even been forcefully quietened in gurdwaras for reciting poems that were considered inappropriate in a holy setting.
But it was in the same year that he made his ultimate breakthrough, when his poem "Mera Marna" (My Death) gained an audience on All India Radio. It caused an overnight sensation, and was quickly followed by "Mera Jamna" (My Birth).
In the later years of his life, tens of thousands of people would turn up to his performances at kavi darbars, where he was usually the final - and most popular - act on the stage. He was in huge demand to speak at weddings and parties, but would never charge for his appearances. He had no need to, as audience members showered him with money and other gifts.
One of his chief patrons was the Maharajah of Patiala Yadavindra Singh, but his poems were appreciated by a wide strata of society, and he was always at pains to retain the common touch. For although he was a well-read man whose poems displayed his full learning and erudition, they were always written in the earthy language of the Punjab.
But while the language was often plain and somewhat rustic, there was a keen art behind the poetry, which employed carefully structured meter and rhyme. Many of his poems were delivered in rhyming couplets, while others used varying combinations of rhyming lines.
It was through this mix of tight rhythmic structure, straightforward humour and - above all - fearless commentary, that Ishar Singh was eventually acknowledged in the field of Punjabi poetry as the 'Has Ras de Badshah' (King of Humour).
He was handed this title by the Chief Minister of the Punjab, Pratap Singh Kairon, when he first read out "Mera Marna" on All India Radio. But it was a reputation he truly earned among his rivals after they set him the daunting challenge of turning his poetic wit to the most sombre event in Sikh history – the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1675, the religion's ninth founding Guru was publicly executed in the main thoroughfare in Delhi – at the behest of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb - for refusing to convert to Islam.
On the anniversary of the martyrdom nearly 300 years later, Ishar Singh rose to the challenge, and delivered his poem to a serious-minded audience in a Delhi maidan. Moments later, the audience was reportedly rolling around in amusement. In a delicate balancing act of tone and judgement, Ishar Singh lampooned the brutal and bloody intolerance of the Islamic rulers, while venerating the sanctity of the Guru’s ultimate sacrifice. Many observers considered this his finest work.
Further background.
Although his family name was Chandhoke, he employed the common poetic construction of using his first name as a suffixed pen name. Thus he was known as Ishar Singh ‘Ishar’. In practice, however, he came to be so closely identified with his best known comic creation that the name ‘Bhaiya’ was usually tagged to the end of his full title.
He was married to Sita Wanti (died 1975), and had five sons and three daughters, who were all born in the Rawalpindi district.
In 1946, a year before the Partition of India created Muslim Pakistan, the entire family – by this time including grandchildren – moved over to live in Delhi, which would soon become capital of the new Hindu-majority India.
Ishar Singh transferred to the Post Office in Shimla in 1949, before retiring back to Delhi in 1954. He was to spend the rest of his days in the city, where he died of a heart attack on 15 January 1966, at the age of 73. The circumstances of his death were almost identical to those he described years earlier in "Mera Marna".
As a man, he paid little respect to the standing and reputation of others. He would keep ministers of state waiting if he felt too tired to see them at social gatherings, while he was known to ridicule the hosts of the very events he was speaking at.
Even those who knew him best said it was difficult to get too close, as he was so entirely absorbed in his writings. His relatives recall how on one occasion, while staying with his son in Kenya in 1959, he journeyed to a park to work on his poetry. He removed his turban, jacket and shoes, and placed them beside him on a bench, before immersing himself in his notebook. It was only when he stopped writing, several hours later, that he noticed his clothing had been stolen. And when his son subsequently took him to report the theft at the police station, Ishar Singh could not even recall the colour of his own turban, jacket and shoes - such had been his dedication to his art that morning.
Several of his descendants became well known in their own right. His eldest son, Hardit Singh (1919–1993), set up the successful Delhi-based firm Ditz Electricals, which still manufactures and supplies household appliances around India to this day.
Ishar Singh's second son, Narinjan Singh ‘Narinjan’ (1921–1991), was the only one of his children to carry on the family poetic tradition. Narinjan Singh regularly recited his own compositions - as well as those of his father - at social gatherings and kavi darbars, first in Delhi, then in Nairobi where he later moved, and finally, towards the end of his life, when he lived in Derby in the UK.

Peak House

Peak House is a historic house located at 347 Main Street in Medfield, Massachusetts.
The original house was built in 1651 by Benjamin Clark, however, it was burned during the King Philip's War in 1676 and the current house was rebuilt ca. 1677-80 by Seth Clark, who was the owner of the original house and when it was burned. Clark re-produced an exact replica of the original house. The Peak House is the oldest house in Medfield and is one of the earliest surviving examples of Post-medieval English (Elizabethan) architecture in the United States. Some of the original panes of glass in the windows, which were imported from England, can still be seen today.
On October 18, 1924, the Peak House was deeded to The Medfield Historical Society, by its then-owners, Mr. and Mrs. Frederick M. Smith, after which the house received a down-to-the-frame restoration. The house has served both as a dwelling and a historical site, as well as an artist's studio and workshop. The Medfield Historical Society's Annual Peak House Pantry, which occurs during the Saturday before Thanksgiving, showcases the Peak House and raises money for its ongoing maintenance. The event offers visitors the opportunity to see both the lower floor with its impressive fireplace and the separate "borning" room, as well as the upstairs sleeping loft that features the original ceiling beams and gunstock posts. In past years at the event, there has been Medfield Historical Society memorabilia for sale, including cup plates in a variety of colors, embossed with the Peak House, refrigerator magnets, and postcards.
The house is currently open every Sunday from 2pm to 5pm from June to September and by appointment at other times. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and may have the highest pitched roof on record in Massachusetts for a 17th-century house.

Pittsburgh in the American Civil War

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was a thriving and important city during the American Civil War, and provided a significant source of personnel, war materiel, armament, ammunition, and supplies to the Union Army. Situated at the confluence of the Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio rivers, Pittsburgh was an important transportation hub for both riverine and rail transport, as well as overland via its system of roads.
Production of materiel.
The antebellum iron industry in Pittsburgh had thrived, fueled by access to coal, iron ore, and other raw materials, as well as transportation routes to get the iron to markets. In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fired smelting to the region. Within three years, the growing needs of the military effort during the Civil War had boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry. Arms manufacture included ironclad warships and the world's first 21" heavy artillery gun. By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh.
During the war, Pittsburgh's heavy industry provided significant quantities of weapons and ammunition. The Fort Pitt Foundry made mammoth iron castings for giant siege howitzers and mortars, among the largest guns in the world. One of the largest was a 20-inch bore Rodman Gun, a large black powder, smoothbore, muzzle-loading coastal defense gun. The foundry produced 1,193 guns (15 percent of the total U.S. wartime artillery production) and almost 200,000 artillery projectiles. Other prominent Pittsburgh area factories included Singer, Nimick and Co. (maker of 3" Ordnance rifles) and Smith, Park and Co., which produced more than 300,000 projectiles. Pittsburgh industries collectively manufactured 10 percent of the total U.S. wartime production of artillery rounds.
The Allegheny Arsenal was the primary military manufacturing facility for U.S. Army accoutrements, as well as saddles and other cavalry equipment. In addition, the sprawling factory produced as many as 40,000 bullets and cartridges every day (more than 14 million per year), supplying between 5 and 10 percent of the Army's annual small arms ammunition requirements. A significant explosion on the afternoon of September 17, 1862 (coincidentally on the same day as the Battle of Antietam in central Maryland), killed 78 factory workers, mostly young women.
Five "Ellet"-class rams were converted from civilian towboats at Pittsburgh. In addition, four ironclads were built from the keel up—the USS "Manayunk", "Marietta", "Sandusky", and "Umpqua". Pittsburgh's rolling mills supplied the armor for many of the ironclads that were built in New York City and Philadelphia for the Union Navy.
The city's 110 year run of hosting a major stock exchange can be traced to the oil traded at Pittsburgh during the war with the creation of Thurston's Oil Exchange on Fourth Avenue, downtown.
Defending Pittsburgh.
Both the Confederate military led Morgan's Raid from the west and Jones-Imboden Raid from the south came within a day's march of the city before being captured or retreating.
Concerned that the Confederate Army might target Pittsburgh for invasion, the U.S. War Department established the Department of the Monongahela to provide a formal Federal military presence in Western Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg Campaign, with departmental headquarters in Pittsburgh. The Army dispatched Maj. Gen. William T. H. Brooks to organize the defenses of Pittsburgh. Brooks authorized the construction of several miles of earthworks and a series of small forts to control access to the city. He suspended liquor sales, and put the citizenry to work digging trenches and erecting forts. Bars and saloons were asked to close but many refused.
Among these bastions was Fort Robert Smalls, a redoubt built by free blacks on McGuire's Hill at the mouth of Becks Run in Arlington Heights. Another of these emergency fortifications was the circular earthwork known as Fort Laughlin, constructed by the employees of Jones and Laughlin Steel on "Ormsby's Hill", now part of Arlington Park on Arlington Avenue. It was also known as "Fort McKinley" or "Fort Ormsby". Concurrent with Fort Laughlin, Jones and Laughlin Steel employees constructed Fort Jones, named for the mill's co-owner, Benjamin Franklin Jones . Fort Jones occupied the top of a hill in Mount Oliver. It was sometimes known as "Fort Jackson", in honor of Brig. Gen. Conrad Feger Jackson, killed in the Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia, in December 1862.
Notable leaders from Pittsburgh.
The greater Pittsburgh area was the birthplace or long-time residence of several Union army and navy officers, as well as some leading politicians of the era.
Other important personalities of the Civil War born in the immediate Pittsburgh area included Col. Daniel Leasure, Congressman Robert McKnight, industrialist William Metcalf, and Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Rowley.
Among the recipients of the Medal of Honor for gallantry in action during the war were Alexander Kelly, a free black who fought in the 6th U.S.C.T..
The mayors of Pittsburgh during the Civil War were George Wilson (1860–62), Benjamin C. Sawyer (1862–64), and James Lowry, Jr. (1864–1866).
Civil War attractions in Pittsburgh.
The Soldiers and Sailors National Military Museum and Memorial is a National Register of Historic Places landmark. It is the largest memorial in the United States dedicated solely to honoring all branches of military veterans and service personnel.
In 2014 a small park was proposed on Mt. Washington overlooking Saw Mill Run where remains of earthwork defenses can still be seen.

32d Air Refueling Squadron

The 32d Air Refueling Squadron (32 ARS) is part of the 305th Air Mobility Wing at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey. It operates the KC-10 Extender aircraft conducting aerial refueling missions.
The squadron is one of the oldest in the United States Air Force, its origins dating to 13 June 1917, being organized at Kelly Field, Texas. The squadron deployed to England as part of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. The squadron saw combat during World War II, and later became part of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) during the Cold War. 
History.
World War I.
Established as an Army Signal Corps aero squadron in June 1917; deployed to France in September 1917. In France, the 32d served as an aircraft repair unit 1917–1918. Served as part of the Army of Occupation in the Rhineland after the 1918 armistice and returned to the United States in April 1919; inactivated.
Inter-war years.
Re-established and activated as an Army Air Corps bombardment squadron in 1932; assigned to California where the squadron flew a mixture of transport; observation and bombers. Received B-18 Bolo medium and early model YB-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers in 1935; subsequently B-17B and B-17Cs in the late 1930s.
World War II.
At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the squadron was under orders to move to the Philippines. A portion of the squadron had already set sail from San Francisco on 6 December only to return on 9 December. The air echelon dispersed to Muroc Army Airfield after the attack for a possible attack on Japanese forces that might attack the California Coast. Later in December the air echelon was assigned to the Sierra Bombardment Group, which deployed to Australia, where it was dissolved and personnel assigned to other squadrons which had withdrawn from the Philippines.
Squadron was reformed in the United States in March 1942, by a redesignation of the newly established 354th Bombardment Squadron; trained under Second Air Force. Flew antisubmarine patrols off the California coast from, late May–early June 1942, then over the Mid-Atlantic coast during June–July 1942.
Deployed to European Theater of Operations (ETO) in August 1942, being assigned to VIII Bomber Command, one of the first B-17 heavy bomb squadrons assigned to England. Engaged in strategic bombardment operations over Occupied Europe, attacking enemy military and industrial targets. Reassigned to Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) as part of Operation Torch invasion of North Africa. Operated from desert airfields in Algeria and Tunisia during North African and Tunisian campaign. Assigned to Northwest African Strategic Air Force during Invasion of Sicily and later Italy in 1943. Allocated to Fifteenth Air Force for strategic bombing of Nazi Germany and occupied Europe. Attacked enemy targets primarily in the Balkans; Southern France; Southern Germany and Austria from southern Italy; engaged in shuttle bombing missions to airfields in the Soviet Union during the summer of 1944.
Personnel largely demobilized after German capitulation in May 1945; squadron reassigned to the United States and was programmed for conversion to B-29 Superfortress operations and deployment to Pacific Theater, plans canceled after Japanese capitulation in August 1945. Aircraft sent to storage and unit inactivated largely as a paper unit in October 1945.
Cold War.
Reactivated in 1946 as a Strategic Air Command B-29 squadron. Deployed to Furstenfeldbruck AB, Germany, July-August 1948; to RAF Station Scrampton, England, October 1948-January 1949; and to RAF Stations Lakenheath and Sculthorpe, May-November 1950 for "show of force" missions in Europe as a result of the Berlin Blockade by the Soviet Union and rising Cold War tensions in Europe.
Equipped in 1953 with B-47 Stratojets; the squadron trained with electronic countermeasures from 1958–1964 and performed aerial refueling operations worldwide from 1965–1979 and since 1981. From c. 10 June–8 October 1972, all personnel and aircraft were on loan to units in the Pacific or other Strategic Air Command units, leaving the squadron unmanned. It deployed most aircraft and personnel to Southeast Asia October–December 1972, in support of Operation Linebacker II. It again deployed aircrews and tankers to various locations for air refueling support in Southwest Asia from August 1990–April 1991.
Modern era.
The 32d received the first KC-10A delivered to the Air Force, at Barksdale AFB, on 17 March 1981.

Carnivàle Lune Bleue

Inspired by travelling carnivals of the 1930s, Carnivàle Lune Bleue is a live entertainment event created in Ottawa, Canada by Executive Producer and Founder Wayne Van De Graaff. Van De Graaff has stated that he was inspired to pursue his lifelong dream and recreate a vintage Depression-era carnival after watching the HBO series Carnivàle. 
Carnivàle Lune Bleue made its world debut in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on July 31, 2008 (special media sneak preview night) and officially opened to the public for an initial month-long run on August 1, 2008. In 2009, Carnivale Lune Bleue performed from July 23 - August 30 at Hog's Back Park in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The opening weekend of the 2009 performance featured a special appearance by Adrienne Barbeau who played Ruthie the Snake Dancer in Carnivàle, the HBO series. 
Carnivàle Lune Bleue has been described as "offering a visceral peek into the life of a Depression-era road show."
Creation of Carnivàle Lune Bleue.
Carnivàle Lune Bleue is the creation of Wayne Van De Graaff, a former international tax and human resources expert who wanted to pay homage to and resurrect the Depression-era travelling carnivals he recalls hearing about from his grandparents while growing up in Utah. 
In developing Carnivàle Lune Bleue, Van De Graaff recruited an international team of circus and carnival advisors, including Johnny Meah who is fondly known as “The Czar of Bizarre” and famous for his work as a carnival advisor and historical consultant for the HBO show Carnivàle”, Claude Le Belle who was one of Cirque du Soleil's first "Tent Masters" and now owns his own company (http://www.sollertia.ca/), Jan-Rok Achard, an internationally renowned circus historian who was instrumental in founding the National Circus School in Montreal (http://www.nationalcircusschool.ca/en/home), Gilles Renaud who worked with the Montreal International Jazz Festival and other entertainment ventures, Holde Unverzagt who painted numerous show fronts and banners for amusement parks and carnivals, and Jim Conklin of Conklin Show's - the largest amusement show provider in Canada since the 1920s (http://conklinshows.com/), to create the most lifelike and authentic old-fashioned carnival experience.
Piece by piece, Wayne Van De Graaff sought out the essential elements to create Carnivàle Lune Bleue. He is adamant that every aspect of the event be as authentic as possible, "We have a spectacular 1938 Allen Herschell three-abreast wooden carousel and the first ever Big Top used by Cirque du Soleil," he explains. "Every tent on the grounds is an authentic recreation of the canvas tents not used or seen since the 1940s."
History of Travelling Carnivals.
Throughout the late 19th Century up to the middle of the 20th century, North America enjoyed the entertainment of traveling carnivals. These carnivals featured circus-style performances, vaudeville or burlesque shows, games of skill and chance, freak shows, sideshows, fortune tellers, and rides such as the carousel and Ferris wheel. Carnivals became particularly popular during the depression years, sometimes known as the "Dirty Thirties," and by 1937 it is estimated that more than 300 carnivals were touring North America.
The carnival would seemingly "blow" unpredictably into town, setting up in empty farmland on the edge of a community and transforming the field into an ocean of colourful tents and banners overnight. Without warning, after several weeks, the carnies would tear down and pack up, heading back to the sawdust trail to seek out their next location.
Attractions.
Carnivàle Lune Bleue 2008 and 2009 lineup featured the following main attractions:
Big Top Main Event featuring Cirque Maroc.
The main event is the Cirque Maroc performance in the vintage Big Top canvas tent. This show features internationally trained circus artists and former Cirque du Soleil trained performers in a 70-minute showcase of acrobatics, trapeze, contortionism, juggling, aerial rope and other such feats inspired by Depression-era circus, cabaret, burlesque and vaudeville shows. The Big Top used for the Cirque Maroc performance is in itself a piece of circus history in that it was the first tent ever used by Cirque du Soleil
Cirque Maroc is produced specifically for Carnivàle Lune Bleue by Production Éclats de Rire (Artistic Directors and Administrators: Nicolette Hazewinkel & Rodrigue Tremblay; Production Manager: Gilles Renaud; Director: Pierre Potvin).
Ten-In-One Freak Show featuring Carnival Diablo.
An homage to the freak shows of the original travelling circuses, the Ten-in-One show features acts such as fire-eating, sword swallowing, and the human dartboard. The freak show also involves a guillotine and an electric chair, an act that leaves audiences with "clasped hands over gaping mouths and (holding) their collective breath in awe."
The Ten-In-One show is produced for Carnivàle Lune Bleue by Scott McClelland of Carnival Diablo (a successful Canadian touring freak show). McClelland has deep roots in the industry and enthusiastically signed on to perform his show in the old-style carnival revival, as his grandfather was involved with the largest travelling circus sideshow in Canada from 1920 to 1968. The show features McClelland himself as "Nikolai Diablo", Sword Swallower Extraordianire; István Betyár, Countess Vanessa and the Illustrated Strongman; The Mighty Leviticus.
Tropical Terrors: Great Snakes of the World.
The Tropical Terrors: Great Snakes of the Word show features snakes and bugs from all over the world, including a giant rock python. There are also boa constrictors, anacondas, spiders, rattlers and other types of pythons, all available in a space-controlled, interactive environment. The Tropical Terrors show is produced for Carnivàle Lune Bleue by Little Ray’s Reptile Zoo (the largest reptile rescue group in Canada and a successful touring zoo across Eastern Ontario).
The Magical Midway.
Carnivàle Lune Bleue also features original, restored carnival rides, including a 1938 Allan Herschell Company vintage carousel and a 1917 Eli Bridge No. 5 Ferris wheel. For safety reasons, seatbelts were installed and the original gasoline engine that ran the Ferris wheel has been replaced with an electric one. The Magical Midway also includes a clairvoyant caravan, a variety of carnival games of skill, a Banner Line (a large art exhibit of carnival banners), a Grab Joint and Candy Joint (with classic carnival drinks and candies), and a vintage 1920s high striker.
The Congress of Wonders Museum.
The one-of-a-kind Congress of Wonders tented exhibit features numerous artifacts, images and displays from the golden age of travelling carnivals including a freaks photo gallery, the infamous Turtle Boy, a genuine bed of nails and the Jersey Devil. The Congress of Wonders Museum
is presented by the North American Carnival Museum and Archives (http://www.nacma.org).
The Cookhouse.
A full service restaurant that pays tribute to classic cuisine from the 1930s is also part of Carnivàle Lune Bleue. The Cookhouse features an open kitchen (built on site specifically for the performance run) and a host of dishes that were popular during the Great Depression.
Future Performances.
The carnival’s founder, Wayne Van De Graaff, planned to take the show on the road in future years, making it a real, travelling carnival.
Currently, there are no future performances.

Billy Idol

William Michael Albert Broad (born 30 November 1955), known professionally as Billy Idol, is an English rock musician. A member of the Bromley Contingent of Sex Pistols fans, Idol first achieved fame in the punk rock era as a member of the band Generation X. He then embarked on a successful solo career, and was a member of the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" of the United States. A series of music videos for songs such as "Dancing With Myself", "White Wedding", "Rebel Yell" and "Eyes Without a Face" made him one of the first MTV stars. Idol continues to tour with guitarist Steve Stevens.
Life and career.
Early life and Generation X.
Idol was born in Stanmore, Middlesex, England. The name "Billy Idol" was inspired by a school teacher's description of Broad as "idle". In an interview on 21 November 1983 Idol also tells us that the name "was a bit of a goof, but also part of the old English school of rock. Billy Fury and all that. It was a 'double thing' not just a poke at the superstar-like people. It was the whole sort of – everyone was doing it too – it was fun, you know?" He goes on to say the name "didn't really ever backfire, only with the stupid people who took it seriously"
In 1958, when Idol was two years old, his parents moved to Patchogue, on Long Island, New York, United States. The family returned to the UK four years later with Idol and a younger child Jane (who had been born in the United States), settling in Dorking, Surrey. In 1971 the family moved to Bromley, Kent, where Idol attended Ravensbourne School for Boys. Idol (rather William Broad) also attended Worthing High School for Boys in West Sussex. In October 1975, Idol went to Sussex University, to pursue an English degree and lived on campus (East Slope) but left after year one (1976). He then went on to join the Bromley Contingent of Sex Pistols fans, a loose gang that travelled into town when the band played.
Idol first joined the punk rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees (before the band had decided on that name) in 1976, but soon quit and joined Chelsea in 1977 as a guitarist. However, he and Chelsea bandmate Tony James soon left that group and co-founded Generation X, with Idol switching from guitarist to lead singer. Generation X were one of the first punk bands to appear on the BBC Television music programme "Top of the Pops". Although a punk rock band, they were inspired by mid-1960s British pop, in sharp contrast to their more militant peers, with Idol stating; "We were saying the opposite to the Clash and the Pistols. They were singing 'No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones', but we were honest about what we liked. The truth was, we were all building our music on the Beatles and the Stones". Generation X signed to Chrysalis Records and released three albums and performed in the 1980 film, "D.O.A.", before disbanding.
Early solo success.
Idol moved to New York City in 1981, and became a solo artist working with ex-Kiss manager, Bill Aucoin. Idol's 'bad boy' image was recognised and this worked well with the flashy glam rock style of his new partner on guitar, Steve Stevens. Together they worked with bassist Phil Feit and drummer Gregg Gerson. Idol's solo career began with the Chrysalis Records EP titled "Don't Stop" in 1981, which included the Generation X song "Dancing with Myself", originally recorded for their last album "Kiss Me Deadly", and a cover of Tommy James & the Shondells' song "Mony Mony". Idol's debut solo album, "Billy Idol", was released in July 1982. Part of the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" of the United States, that year Idol became an MTV staple with "White Wedding" and "Dancing with Myself". In 1983, in an effort to introduce Idol to American audiences not yet as familiar with him as those in the UK, Idol's label released "Dancing with Myself" in the United States in conjunction with a music video directed by Tobe Hooper, which played on MTV for six months.
"Rebel Yell" and superstar years.
Idol's second LP, "Rebel Yell" (1983) was a major success and established Idol in the United States with hits like "Eyes Without a Face," "Flesh For Fantasy", and the title cut. Tracks from the album featured in the 1988 Hollywood comedy film "Big", which starred Tom Hanks. "Eyes Without a Face" peaked at number four on the United States "Billboard" Hot 100, and "Rebel Yell" reached number six in the UK Singles Chart. This album and its singles saw Idol become very popular in other countries such as Germany, Italy, Switzerland and New Zealand.
"Whiplash Smile".
Idol released "Whiplash Smile" in 1986, which sold well. The album included the hits "To Be a Lover," "Don't Need a Gun" and "Sweet Sixteen". Idol filmed a video featuring "Sweet Sixteen" (which he also wrote) in Florida's Coral Castle. The song was inspired by the story of Edward Leedskalnin's former love, Agnes Scuffs, who was the main reason Leedskalnin built the structure over a period of decades, starting years after she jilted him the day before their scheduled wedding in their native Latvia.
In 1986, Stevens appeared with Harold Faltermeyer on the "Top Gun" soundtrack. Their contribution was the Grammy winning instrumental, "Top Gun Anthem". Harold was producer Keith Forsey's partner when Keith was working with Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder. Steve was working on Billy Idol album Whiplash Smile, and when it came time for keyboards, Harold came in to play. Harold got Stevens to play with him on the Top Gun score.
After the success Steve had received, the partnership between Idol and Stevens fell apart. Besides playing an acoustic show for KROQ in 1993, Stevens and Idol would not tour again until early 1999. Stevens and Idol collaborated in the mid-1990s, playing with Guns N Roses members Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum in 1995. Billy, Steve, Duff and Matt can be seen performing "Christmas in the USA" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 1995.
In 1987, Billy was walking in a park in New York with a woman called Grace Hattersley when they were stopped by police. The police found cocaine on Hattersley. Billy said the drugs were not his and was released. Hattersley held a press conference saying that she was Billy Idol's girlfriend. Billy's longtime girlfriend, Perri Lister decided to hold a press conference of her own, telling the world that she was, and had always been Idol's girlfriend.
A remix album was released in 1987 called, "Vital Idol". The album featured a live rendition of his cover of Tommy James' "Mony Mony". In 1987 the single topped the United States chart, and reached number 7 in the UK. The album had already been available in the UK for two years.
Billy and his girlfriend Perri Lister moved from New York to Los Angeles. Lister became pregnant with Billy's son Willem Wolfe, and Billy was trying to get a movie called, "King Death" made. The movie was based on a book by Nik Cohn. The book is about a man that commits assassinations on television.
Idol did not stay loyal to Perri Lister, and started seeing Linda Mathis, who was thirteen years younger than Idol. At the age of 19, Mathis became pregnant and chose to move in with her mother to have her child. Mathis had a child, a girl named Bonnie Blue Broad, born 21 August 1989.
In 1989, Idol appeared on stage with the Who as Cousin Kevin as part of the live version of "Tommy", which was aired as an HBO special and released on home video and later as a DVD. In later years, Idol also stood in as a guest performer with the Who on "Bell Boy", a hit from their rock opera album "Quadrophenia", and provided the lead vocals that were originally sung by the band's late drummer Keith Moon. On these brief appearances, Idol dressed in a bell boy's uniform to reflect upon Moon's eccentricity on stage.
After his break-up with Perri, Idol travelled to Bangkok and had to be forcibly removed from the country. Idol had been in Bangkok for several weeks, and was staying at different hotels and causing a lot of damage to the rooms. After refusing to vacate a hotel penthouse where a three-week drug-and-sex spree had racked up a bill of about US$250,000. It was reported that an important dignitary wanted the room and Idol refused to give it up. Idol was strapped to a gurney and was escorted to the airport by soldiers. Idol was given the choice of either going to jail, or leaving the country.
Idol was involved in a serious motorbike accident which nearly cost him a leg on 6 February 1990 at the corner of Gordon Avenue and Fountain Avenue in Hollywood. He was hit by a car when he ran a stop sign while riding home from the studio one night, requiring a steel rod to be placed in his leg. Shortly prior to this, film director James Cameron had chosen Idol to play the T-1000 character in "" and had drawn storyboards to resemble him, but the accident prevented Idol from accepting.
Charmed life.
"Charmed Life" was released in 1990, and a video for the single "Cradle of Love" had to be shot. The song had been featured in the Andrew Dice Clay film, "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane". Since Idol was unable to walk, he was shot from the waist up. The video featured video footage of him singing in large frames throughout an apartment, while Betsy Lynn George was trying to seduce a businessman. The video was placed in rotation on MTV. "Cradle of Love" earned Idol a third Grammy Award nomination for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. Against his doctors' advice, he also managed to make appearances to promote "Charmed Life".
Cyberpunk.
In 1993, Idol released "Cyberpunk". Regarded as experimental, it was recorded in a home studio using a Macintosh computer, which was a new concept at the time. Idol used Studiovision and Pro-Tools to record the album. The album took ten months to make. Idol recorded the album with guitarist Mark Younger-Smith and producer Robin Hancock.
Special editions of the album were issued with a floppy disc which contained a screensaver. It was one of the first albums which listed the e-mail address of the artist (idol@well.sf.ca.us, now inactive) in its booklet. In 1996, Idol appeared in a live version of The Who's "Quadrophenia".
Billy got the idea for the album during his stay in the hospital after his motorcycle accident. Punk rock journalists Legs McNeil interviewed Idol and called him a "Cyberpunk" because of the muscle stimulator on his leg. It looked like man merging with machine. Idol was now sporting a new look.
Billy played a Generation X reunion show in 1993.
Idol shot a concept video for "Shock to the System". The video would feature Idol being attacked by several police for trying to videotape them beating up someone on the street. It resembled the Rodney King beating that prompted the LA riots. Idol would then turn into a cyborg that scared away the police. A video EP was released to retail stores.
Idol had a lot of grand ideas for "Cyberpunk" and the short tour that followed. He changed his look during this period, growing a set of dreadlocks, and had a lot of ideas about using 'Blendo' video footage during his show. Colorful footage and images would be edited live on a computer to fit the music.
In 1994 Idol collapsed outside a Los Angeles nightclub due to an overdose on a drug called GHB. GHB happened to be a legal drug at the time, which was mainly used by weight-lifters. The drug would slow one's system down, putting the body into a relaxed, comatose-like state. Drugs like this are often used to alter the effects of other drugs, such as cocaine, which speed the system up. Idol admitted to being hooked on a lot of heavier drugs at that time.
After the incident, Idol realised that his children would never forgive him for dying of a drug overdose, and he began to focus more on fatherhood. Idol has never admitted that he is totally off drugs, just that he has his habit under control. He claims to have first smoked marijuana at the age of 12, and also says he took acid at the age of thirteen. "Cyberpunk" pays tribute to Lou Reed with Idol's cover of "Heroin".
Idol didn't want to release an album during this period because he was having a lot of problems with his record label. It was decided that he would wind up owing the record company money if he produced anything. EMI hired producer, Glenn Ballard to work with him on a new project, but Idol battled the label over creative differences and the album was put on hold.
In 1994 Idol and Steve Stevens contributed a song called "Speed"to the soundtrack of the hit movie "Speed" starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Even though Idol and Stevens worked together on this track, a reunion was not in the works.
Idol was a performer three times during the 1990s at Neil Young's Bridge School Benefit Concert, which is still held each October.
Film appearances.
Idol made a cameo appearance as himself in the 1998 film "The Wedding Singer" with Adam Sandler, in which Idol ultimately saved the relationship between characters Robbie Hart (Sandler) and Julia Sullivan (played by Drew Barrymore). Idol also had a small part in the film "The Doors", directed by Oliver Stone. Idol played Jim Morrison's drinking pal, Cat.
Reunion with Steve Stevens.
He returned to the public eye in 1998, when he played himself in "The Wedding Singer", a film that also featured "White Wedding" on its soundtrack. He was also considered for the role of the villain, Jacob Kell, in "", although ultimately Bruce Payne was cast.
VH1 aired "Billy Idol – Behind the Music" on 16 April 2001. Idol and Stevens took part in a "VH1 Storytellers" show three days later. The reunited duo set out to play a series of acoustic/storytellers shows before recording the VH1 special. Another "Greatest Hits" CD was issued in 2001, with Keith Forsey and Simple Minds' "Don't You (Forget About Me)" appearing on the compilation. Forsey and Schiff had originally written it with Idol in mind, but the singer turned it down and eventually the song was given to Simple Minds, who made it a hit in 1985. The LP also includes a live acoustic version of "Rebel Yell", taken from a performance at Los Angeles station KROQ's 1993 Acoustic Christmas concert.
In 2000, Idol was invited to be a guest vocalist on Tony Iommi's album. His contribution was on the song "Into The Night", which he also co-wrote. That year he voice acted the role of Odin, a mysterious alien character, in the animated fantasy film "Heavy Metal 2000". In the 2002 NRL Grand Final in Sydney, Idol entered the playing field for the pre-match entertainment on a hovercraft-type stage to the intro of "White Wedding", when he managed to sing only two words before a power failure ended the performance. "White Wedding" appeared on popular video game "", playing on fictional Classic rock radio station, K-DST.
"Devil's Playground" and beyond.
"Devil's Playground", which came out in March 2005, was Idol's first new studio album in nearly 12 years. Idol reunited with guitarist Steve Stevens and producer Keith Forsey to record the album. It was after a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom that Sanctuary Records approached Idol about making new music in his older style. Idol claims that seeing people like Slash making hit records again gave him hope that there was life after death.
The album was recorded with the entire band playing in one room, rather that each person recording their part separately. Idol's drummer, Brian Tichy, collaborated with Idol and Stevens and co-wrote some of the tracks on the album. The first single and video to be released was 'Scream.' Idol had been playing a batch of new songs in concert that never made the final release of the album. These songs include 'Monster', 'Stranger in My Skin', 'Walk the Line', 'Man in the Killbox', 'Beautiful Life' and 'Big World' (written for his daughter).
It reached No. 46 on the Billboard 200. The album included a cover of "Plastic Jesus". Idol played a handful of dates on the 2005 Vans Warped Tour and also appeared at the Download Festival at Donington Park, the Voodoo Music Experience in New Orleans and Rock am Ring. Guitarist Steve Stevens broke his ulna while taking a few bags into his hotel in New Orleans. The guitarist had to perform most of the tour in a two piece removable cast.
In 2006, as his only UK live date, he appeared headlining the Sunday night of GuilFest. That same year he made an appearance on "Viva La Bam" where he helped Bam Margera succeed in "creating" a sunroof for his Lamborghini Gallardo and performed live for April Margera for her birthday. In 2006, Idol guested on his keyboardist Derek Sherinian's solo album "Blood of the Snake", covering the 1970 Mungo Jerry hit "In the Summertime". A video was made featuring Idol and guitarist Slash. In November 2006, Idol released a Christmas album called "Happy Holidays".
In 2008, "Rebel Yell" appeared as a playable track on the video game, "Guitar Hero World Tour", and "White Wedding" on "Rock Band 2". The "Rock Band 2" platform later gaining "Mony Mony" and "Rebel Yell" as downloadable tracks. On 24 June 2008, Idol released a new greatest hits album, "". The compilation featured two previously unreleased tracks, "John Wayne" and "New Future Weapon". A third track, "Fractured", was available for download on iTunes. He embarked on a worldwide tour, co-headlining with Def Leppard.
In July 2009, Idol performed at the Congress Theater, Chicago for the United States television series "Soundstage". This performance was recorded and was released on DVD/Blu-ray as "In Super Overdrive Live", on 17 November 2009.

Louis-Charles Couturier

Louis-Charles Couturier (12 May 1817, Chemillé-sur-Dôme, Diocese of Tours - 29 October 1890, Solesmes) was a French Benedictine, abbot of the monastery of Saint-Pierre at Solesmes and President of the French Congregation of Benedictines.
Life.
He was educated at the petit séminaire of Combrée in Anjou and at the grand séminaire of Angers, and was ordained priest 12 March 1842. After teaching history at Combrée from 1836 to 1854, he entered, in the latter year, the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Pierre at Solesmes, then newly restored by Dom Guéranger. 
Guérangerappointed him master of novices one month after his profession, and towards the end of 1861 made him prior of the monastery. On the death of Guéranger he was unanimously elected Abbot (11 February 1875). Pope Pius IX appointed him consultor of the Sacred Congregation of the Index, and granted him and his successors the privilege of wearing the "cappa magna".
Couturier and his monks were forcibly expelled from their monastery by the government, on 6 November 1880, and, having attempted to reoccupy it, they were driven out a second time on 29 March 1882. During the remainder of Couturier's life the community lived in three separate houses in the town of Solesmes, using the parochial church as their abbey church. 
Couturier encouraged writers among his monks, and restored old and deserted monasteries, as well as fostering the foundations made by Guéranger. On 28 March 1876, he raised the priory of St. Mary Magdalene at Marseilles to the dignity of an abbey; in 1880 he restored and repeopled the monastery of Silos in Spain; in July, 1889, he established the priory of Saint-Paul at Wisques, in the Diocese of Arras; and on 15 September 1890, shortly before his death, he reopened the ancient monastery of Glanfeuil in the Diocese of Angers, deserted since the French Revolution. 
Works.
His literary labours were chiefly his collaboration in the publication of "Les Actes des Martyrs", a French translation of the Acts of the martyrs from the beginning of the Christian Era to our times. The third edition of the work appeared in four volumes (Paris, 1900).

Norwood Memorial Municipal Building

Norwood Memorial Municipal Building (Norwood Town Hall) is a historic building located in Norwood, Massachusetts.
The Late Gothic Revival building was built in 1927-28, and is made of Weymouth seamed-face granite. Visitors often mistake it for a church or believe it to have been a church, but it never was; its stained-glass windows depict not saints, but local patriot Aaron Guild.
"Guild", whose name appears in local street and building names, is pronounced with a long i, like the second syllable of the word "beguiled".
Guild's significance is explained by an inscription on the Aaron Guild Memorial Stone, dedicated in 1903, which stands outside the Norwood public library. The inscription reads:
Guild and his oxen are featured in the town seal.
It includes a 57-bell carillon tower housing the Walter F. Tilton Memorial Carillon, one of nine carillons in Massachusetts and the seventh-largest in the United States.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

Great Mosque of Brussels

The Great Mosque of Brussels is the oldest mosque in Brussels. It is located in the Cinquantenaire Park. It is also the seat of the "Islamic and Cultural Centre of Belgium". 
The original building was built by architect Ernest Van Humbeek in an Arabic style, to form the Oriental Pavilion of the National Exhibition in Brussels in 1880. At that time the pavilion housed a monumental painting on canvas: “Panorama of Cairo”, by the Belgian painter Emile Wauters, which enjoyed major success. However, lack of maintenance in the twentieth century caused the building to deteriorate gradually. 
In 1967, King Baudouin made a gift of the building to King Faisal ibn Abd al-Aziz of Saudi Arabia, on an official visit to Belgium, that it might be turned into a place of worship for the use of the Muslim community of Belgium which had grown considerably by that time. The mosque, after a long reconstruction carried out at the expense of Saudi Arabia by Tunisian architect Boubaker, was inaugurated in 1978 in the presence of Khalid ibn Abd al-Aziz and Baudouin. The Mosque's role the leading religious institution within the Belgian Islamic community—as well as its intended role as diplomatic bridge between the Saudi and Belgian monarchies—has been a point of debate since its re-foundation.
Today, it also hosts a school and an Islamic research centre whose objectives are to propagate the Muslim faith. The centre also provides courses of Arabic for adults and children, as well as introductory courses in Islam.

Richard Guidry

Richard Guidry was a Cajun cultural activist and educator who worked to save the French language in Louisiana.
Born in Gueyden, Louisiana, on October 18, 1949, Guidry (who referred to himself as “"Le gros Cadien"," or The Big Cajun) attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana (now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette), where he obtained a bachelor's degree in French and Spanish, and a master's degree in French Education.
He subsequently taught French in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, before working for the Louisiana Department of Education as Education Programs Coordinator in Foreign Languages and Bilingual Education (Region IV). In this post he introduced Louisiana French into the French education curriculum — a major advance considering the social stigma formerly attached to speaking the state's French dialects.
Richard taught Cajun French at his alma mater, where he served as an adjunct faculty member, and worked as a co-editor and consultant on the "Dictionary of French as Spoken in Louisiana". He appeared in French-language theatrical productions and in documentary programs on radio and television, and he authored several publications, including "C’est p’us pareil", a literary collection in the Cajun and Creole dialects.
For his contributions to the French language in Louisiana, France awarded Richard the title of "Chevalier" in the Ordre des Palmes Académiques in 1995.
Guidry died July 27, 2008, in Lafayette, Louisiana.

Annona senegalensis

Annona senegalensis, commonly known as African custard-apple, wild custard apple, and wild soursop, is a species of flowering plant in the custard apple family, Annonaceae. The specific epithet, "senegalensis", translates to mean "of Senegal", the country where the type specimen was collected.
A traditional food plant in Africa, the fruits of "A. senegalensis" have the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable land care. Well known where it grows naturally, it is largely unheard of elsewhere.
Description.
"Annona senegalensis" takes the form of either a shrub or small tree, growing between two and six meters tall. Occasionally, it may become as tall as 11 m.
"A. senegalensis" is generally pollinated by several species of beetle, but can be hand pollinated when grown as a crop plant. Its seed viability usually lasts no more than six months.
Habitat.
"A. senegalensis" tends to grow in semiarid to subhumid regions adjacent to the coast, often, but not exclusively, on coral-based rocks with mostly sandy, loamy soils, from sea level up to 2400 meters, at mean temperatures between 17 and 30°C, and mean rainfall between 700 and 2500 mm. They are often solitary plants within woodland savannah understory, also frequently in swamp forests, or riverbanks, or on former cropland left fallow for an extended period.
Distribution.
It is native to tropical east and northeast, west and west-central, and southern Africa, as well as southern subtropical Africa, and islands in the western Indian Ocean. Specific to the nation of South Africa, it is found in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, and Mpumalanga.
"A. senegalensis" has become naturalized in parts of India.
Uses.
The primary use of this versatile plant is for food, but it has applications in numerous aspects of human endeavor, and every part of the plant has unique properties and uses.
The flowers, leaves and fruit are edible and culinary: white fruit pulp has a mild, pineapple-like flavor. Flowers are added to spice or garnish meals; leaves are eaten by humans as vegetables, or browsed by livestock. Leaves are also part of the diet of the West African giraffe.
The leaves are also used to create a general health tonic, in the treatment of pneumonia, and as mattress and pillow stuffing. Specific to Sudan, leaves are boiled in the making of perfume.
Bark can be processed to produce yellow-brown dye, insecticide, or medicine for treating a wide array of ailments, including worms parasitic on the intestines or flesh (notably guinea worms), diarrhea, gastroenteritis, lung infections, toothaches, and even snakebites. Natural gum in the bark is used to close open wounds.
Roots are also used medicinally in treating a gamut of conditions, from dizziness and indigestion to chest colds to venereal diseases.
Suckering shoots provide binding fibers, and the malleable, pale brown to white wood is used to carve tool handles, or fashioned into poles. Wood ash is an admixture to chewing tobacco and snuff, and also in soap production as solvent.
The essential oils in the fruits and leaves are valued for their organic chemical constituents: car-3-ene (in fruit) and linalool (from leaves).
Certain parts of "A. senegalensis" are used in treating skin or eye disorders.
Many South Africans believe the roots can cure insanity. Some Mozambicans feed them to infants to wean them from their mother's breast.
Anthracnose.
Like other species within the genus "Anonna", "A. senegalensis" is commonly afflicted by anthracnose, brought on by the fungal pathogen "Colletotrichum gloesporioides", which leads to leaf drop, eventually followed by mummification of its fruit. Controls often employed against the disease include spray applications of fermate or phygon.

The building will have 28 levels and a height of 112 meters/367feet will become the highest in the country and even in Central America except for Panama, it was reported.
The project is built in one of the most important commercial areas of the city. The building has a 97 percent advance, but already sold 55 of the 88 apartments that form the tower, said yesterday Alberto Poma, general manager of Roble Group.
"We wanted to differentiate by offering a product that is unique in the country in terms of city apartments," he said.
The apartments of two and three bedrooms are priced from the 348 thousand dollars, and include lighting, smoke detectors, hot water, marble and wood floors, granite floors in kitchen and central air conditioning, among others.
El Pedregal is aimed at people who want to live in a safe and enjoyable environment, "said Poma.
The tower is part of a multipurpose project to be developed in phases on a total area of seven blocks (excluding the area Multiplaza).
The master plan of the mega project includes a five star hotel, office buildings, most apartments in height and the existing mall.
The works shall be implemented as the market demands. "It's a difficult project to replicate ... our group used to differentiate," he said.
The apartments have a view of the volcano, San Salvador and Santa Elena, and also be surrounded by green areas, lobby, parking for visitors, children's play area, indoor and outdoor multi-purpose room, pool and gym, among other attractions.
In addition, the building will be equipped with the latest technology for security; for example, enter the elevators through fingerprint;

<doc id="18678652" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18678652" title="Tux3">
Tux3

Tux3 is an open-source versioning filesystem created by Daniel Phillips. He introduced the filesystem as a public replacement for his Tux2 filesystem which had encountered licensing issues due to the filing of several patents. Phillips had previously created the Htree directory indexing system which eventually became an official feature of ext3. The technical details of Tux3 were first publicized in an email on 23 July 2008. 
Design.
In broad outline, Tux3 follows a conventional Unix-style inode/file/directory design. A Tux3 inode table is a B-tree with versioned attributes at the leaves. A file is an inode attribute that is a B-tree with versioned extents at the leaves. Directory indexes are mapped into directory file blocks as with Htree. Free space is mapped by a B-tree with extents at the leaves. It attempts to avoid traditional journaling by introducing a recovery logic which allows it to recover upon remounting.
A Tux3 inode is a variable sized object consisting of a list of attributes, each labeled by the version at which the attribute was added, changed or removed. The B-tree index by which inodes are referenced is not versioned. The B-tree index of a large file is also not versioned, except for the leaves of the index, which contain lists of extents, each labeled by the version at which the referenced file data was added or changed. This style of versioning is essentially the inverse of tree versioning methods used by Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL), ZFS and Btrfs, where multiple tree roots of an entire filesystem are created in order to express differences between versions of the filesystem. 
A claimed advantage of Tux3 style versioned entities is that only a few bytes need to be added to represent single changes to inode attributes or to index new versions of file data blocks, compared to some number of index blocks needing to be allocated and written for tree-versioned filesystems.
Development history.
As of August 2008, Tux3 was only capable of performing basic file I/O on files. By the end of 2008, Tux3 was capable of running within the kernel and able to sustain repeated runs of the file system exerciser fsx-linux, a big accomplishment.
On 17 February 2009, Linux booted from a Tux3 root filesystem for the first time.
On 18 January 2013, initial fsck support was added. So far it just checks physical referential integrity, but the developers are confident that they can make a fully functional e2fsck-quality fsck soon.

The Hunnewell Estates Historic District is a historic district between the Charles River and Lake Waban in Wellesley, Massachusetts, near Boston on the west. It consists of the large group of mid 19th to early 20th century estate properties with gardens, residences, and landscapes of the Hunnewell family.
History.
The Hunnewell estates began with talented industrialist, banker, businessman, landscape designer, and horticulturalist Horatio Hollis Hunnewell in the late 1840s, and continued with his adult children, and the following generations. Horatio Hollis Hunnewell and his family gave much to the town of Wellesley, which was renamed after his wife's family - the Welles, and to Boston, with civic philanthropy in numerous fields. 
They also were generous to the New England horticulture community for over 75 years via importing, testing, and distributing many new plant introductions, estate site planning and garden design examples, and supportive leadership in the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. Horatio Hollis Hunnewell was especially interested in coniferous and broad-leaved evergreens, and Asian rhododendrons.
At their peak during the early 20th century 'American Country Place' era, there were twenty contiguous Hunnewell estates along Washington Street and Pond Road in southwest Wellesley.
Conservation.
The Hunnewell Estates Historic District, still largely owned and occupied by members of the Hunnewell family, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. 
Hundreds of acres in the district have been placed under conservation restrictions with The Trustees of Reservations and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by the Hunnewells, preserving the unique residence gardens, designed estate landscapes, and natural native landscape reserves for future generations.

<doc id="18678663" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18678663" title="Seeheimer Kreis">
Seeheimer Kreis

The Seeheimer Kreis is an official, internal grouping in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Known for being right-wing within its party, the group promotes comparatively value–conservative politics with relatively liberal economic positions. The group was founded in September 1974. One of the prominent founding members is Gesine Schwan, a former SPD candidate for the German Presidency. The group is led by Petra Ernstberger, Garrelt Duin, and Johannes Kahrs. The Circle is named after their long-term meeting place, the Seeheim on Bergstraße in Southern Hessia.
History.
Even in the 1950s, a group of conservative or traditional members of the SPD met regularly in an informal group known as the Kanalarbeiter (Canal Workers.) They were considered to be one of the most influential groups within the larger Social Democratic Party.
The most prominent members of the Canal Workers were Egon Franke and Annemarie Renger. Annemarie Renger's membership shows that the lineage of the national wing of the Social Democrats goes even further back in history, as Renger's former employer was Kurt Schumacher, who through his Doctoral Advisor Johann Plenge could claim a connection all the way to the Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch-Gruppe, established during the First World War.
Parallel to the development of the Canal Workers, starting in 1969 an additional conservative grouping within the SPD was initiated by Günther Metzger, known as the Metzger Circle, which soon developed in 1972 into the Arbeitskreis Linke Mitte (Left Middle Work Circle), which can be considered as the forerunner of today's Seeheimer Circle.
In the course of the late 1960s leftward shift of the Jusos, the youth organization of the Social Democrats, the Left wing of the SPD increased in influence and numbers. 
A meeting in the Dorint-Hotel in Lahnstein in December 1974 is considered to be the official founding of the Seeheimer, however even in 1973 a group of around 40 Social Democrats met at the invitation of Hans-Jochen Vogel to discuss a way to come out of the "theoretical and ideological defensive" posed by the left wing of the party. Other founding members include Richard Löwenthal and Gesine Schwan. Though the Seeheimer ended up not accomplishing their initially stated goal of serving as a provocative ideological counterweight within the Party, they experienced early successes in gaining influence in SPD staffing policy and in pushing through broader Social Democratic Party decisions. The early Seeheimers followed in the footsteps of the Canal Workers, whose motto was "nothing happens without us."
From 1978 to 1984, the group, which was also known as the Lahnsteiner Circle, met in the Lufthansa Training Center in Seeheim on the Bergstraße, the origin of the name "Seeheimer."
Between 1974 and 1982 Chancellor Helmut Schmidt included several Seeheimer in his Cabinet, who had supported him during the debates in the party about the industrial use of nuclear energy and the NATO Double-Track Decision.
After the end of the Helmut Schmidt Era, the Kanalarbeiter, who had represented the interests of traditional, non-intellectual union workers, definitively merged with the Seeheimer Circle, which in contrast was considered to be "intellectual."
During conflicts during the 1980s within the Social Democrats about the direction of the party, the Seeheimer Circle opposed the alliance between the Social Democrats at Alliance 90/The Greens. The Seeheimer also distinguished themselves during this period from other currents within the SPD by supporting reunification with East Germany as a political goal.
After reunification with East Germany in 1990, the Seeheimer added two prominent Social Democrats from the former GDR to their ranks, Stephan Hilsberg and Markus Meckel. 
During the 1998-2005 chancellorship of Gerhard Schröder, the Seeheimer supported his changes to social services.
Personnel.
The Circle is led by Petra Ernstberger, Garrelt Duin, and Johannes Kahrs. Other leading members of the Seeheimer are Doris Barnett, Fritz-Rudolf Körper, Edgar Franke, Sport Committee Chairwoman Dagmar Freitag, Carsten Schneider, Rolf Schwanitz, Defense Committee Chairwoman Susanne Kastner, who belong to a group known as the Sprecherkreis. Members of the advisory board for the Seeheimer include SPD Party Leader Sigmar Gabriel, Ulla Schmidt, and Wolfgang Tiefensee.
Garrelt Duin, Member of the German Bundestag.
Garrelt Duin studied Law and Theology, and practices law as an independent attorney. Before taking office in the German Bundestag in 2005, he served as a member of the European Parliament. Within the Social Democratic party, he is industrial speaker and economic speaker. Speaker Duin was the leader of the Social Democrats in Lower Saxony and is a member of the Board of Advisors for the German Public Radio station NDR. In the Social Democratic (working group??)for Technology and Economy, he focuses on strengthening the German industrial base, working against climate change, understanding the Internet and New Media, and last but not least, the intelligent combination of environmental, social, and economic policy.

Political Views.
The Seeheimer Circle focuses on pragmatic solutions in social policy, financial policy, and economic policy. The party strives to align social welfare with financial possibilities, a commitment to give and take in social welfare, a reduction of national debt, the necessity of reforms through pragmatic handling, and an open minded relationship to globalization. Moreover, the Seeheimer Circle views demographic change as a central policy field and is ready to take social policy in directions which could lay outside of Social Democratic tradition. However, this readiness for innovation would not contradict the Party Program of the Social Democrats.

Holley Performance Products

Holley Performance Products is an automotive performance company based in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Holley, when based in Michigan, was one of the major producers of carburetors, being supplied as standard equipment on many Detroit-built automobiles.
Later they manufactured carburetors for V8 street and racing applications such as the Holley "double pumper". Holley-style carburetors have powered every NASCAR Sprint Cup team and every NHRA Pro–Stock champion for four decades, these series clinging to the carburetor long after the car manufacturers had switched to fuel-injection. Holley's product range has expanded to include fuel injection, performance fuel pumps, intake manifolds, cylinder heads and engine dress–up products for street performance, race and marine applications. Among the company's owned divisions are brand names Nitrous Oxide Systems (NOS), Weiand, FlowTech, Earls and Hooker Headers.
History.
Holley began in Bradford, Pennsylvania in 1896 when brothers George (1878-1963) and Earl Holley started a company to produce a small one-cylinder three-wheeled vehicle they dubbed the "Runabout", with a top speed of 30 mph. At the eve of the era of motorcars, the brothers decided to start the Holley Motor Company, and produced one four-wheeled model: "The Holley brothers built their first marketable automobile in 1902. They called it the Holley Motorette and it sold for $550. More than 600 were produced." 
"Their first original carburetor, called the "iron pot", appeared on the curved-dash Oldsmobile in 1904." In April 1905 Holley Brothers Company was established with an address at 661-75 Beaubien St., Detroit, Michigan. The brothers then concentrated on the manufacturing of carburetors and ignition systems. As a result of the Motorette Henry Ford commissioned the brothers to produce a carburetor for his Model T. "The carburetor they built for Ford was an immediate success and the brothers founded Holley Carburetor Co., which became one of Ford's biggest suppliers." 
In 1913 George Holley made a tour of Germany to study manufacturing methods, accompanied by Henry M. Leland, when it was said that a Holley carburetor: "was on more than one-half of the automobiles sent out from American factories this year." 
In 1925 a Holley employee, Daniel H. Meloche, was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. He had invented an improved refractory coating for casting molds, allowing permanent iron molds to make gray iron castings over many cycles, whereas earlier iron molds were quickly consumed when casting iron. The process employing long-life molds was leased to the River Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Company, the Harrison Radiator Corporation, and the plant of Ludwig, Loewe & Co., of Berlin.
In 1929 the "Los Angeles Times" reported that George M. Holley of Pasadena and Detroit and a director of the Aviation Corporation of Delaware, has been elected a director of the Bach Aircraft Corporation. Holley, while serving as president of the Holley Carburetor Company, was also a director of National Air Transport, Kinner Airplane and Motor, Stinson Aircraft of Detroit, Air Investors Inc., Towie Aircraft Company of Detroit, and one of the original stockholders of Western Air Express Inc. In 1931 Holley became a director of the Warner Aircraft Corporation.
In 1952 Holley closed a plant at Portland, Michigan, which moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky. 
That year Holley produced the Visi-flo carburetor, with a glass inspection window to make a visual check of the fuel level, sediment, flooding and float action. The glass fuel bowl was manufactured by the Lancaster Lens company of Lancaster, Ohio.
In 1955 the "Wall Street Journal" reported: "Bowling Green Manufacturing Co., a subsidiary of Holley Carburetor Co., each year sends its employes dummy "checks" made out for the amount each employee has received indirectly through fringe benefits." 
In 1968 the "Plain Dealer" reported: "Colt Industries Inc. has acquired Holley Carburetor Co., of Warren, Michigan, following approval by directors of both companies. Holley Carburetor which makes auto ignition systems and aviation fuel controls, employs about 3,000 at four facilities in three states." At this time the corporate, engineering and sales headquarters were in Warren, with plants in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Clare, Michigan. Holley was said to have a turnover of $40 million in 1967. At the time of the sale the company was primarily owned by members of the Holley family.
In 1974 Holley was making carburetors for Ford and some under its own name at Paris, Tennessee. "Significant facilities expansions were initiated in 1979 at Water Valley, Mississippi to meet carburetor requirements for the new Ford Motor Company four-cylinder car, code named "Erika", and in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Sallisaw, Oklahoma." In 1993 Coltec Industries Inc., of New York, closed the administrative offices at Warren, Michigan, and a warehouse at Goodlettsville, Tennessee. These functions were moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.
Holley entered the 1980s positioned as the only carburetor manufacturer to offer entire fuel systems from intakes to fuel pumps. Holley continued its dominance in nearly all forms of racing powering all winning NHRA Pro Stock racers and once again all NASCAR Sprint Cup Series™ teams of the day. The ‘80s also saw Holley’s entrance into the fuel injection market where original equipment EFI components and analog Pro-Jection® retrofit fuel injection systems for carbureted cars were introduced.
In the early 1990’s Holley continued its new product introductions. The wildly popular HP Pro Series race ready carburetors were introduced. Many became the standard in racing but are not exclusive. During this time Holley invented the SysteMAX® engine kits that included matched cylinder heads, intakes and cams. The Dominator also evolved in the ‘90s into the HP Dominator, huge billet electric fuel pumps were introduced, and retrofit EFI kits evolved into digital Pro-Jection 4D and 4Di.
In 1998 Coltec Industries sold Holley Performance for $100 million to a management-led team backed by Kohlberg & Co., L.L.C. 
In 1999, after becoming independent of Coltec Industries, the management team purchased a number of other aftermarket companies in an effort to provide a "full package" to their customers/dealers. These companies include: Weiand (intake manifolds and superchargers), B&M's supercharger division, Hooker Headers, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Flow Tech exhaust, Lunati (camshafts, crankshafts, pistons and connecting rods), NOS (Nitrous Oxide Systems, Inc), and So-Cal Speed Shop, as well as a few ancillary companies.
In 2000 Holley leased a facility in Aberdeen, Mississippi, with a plan to centralise five existing plants in the U.S.A., Mexico and Canada.
2009 Former Holley CFO Tom Tomlinson is appointed CEO of Holley Performance.
2010 Holley creates the LS Fest, a show, race and celebration of vehicles that utilize a GM LSV8 engine. The LS-Fest has a variety of bracket racing, engine swap, braking, autocross, show & shine and other events that attracted large crowds and participants to the show's venue September 10–12, 2010, at Beech Bend Raceway in Bowling Green, KY. Heavy media attention from niche, consumer performance publications, TV shows and websites. The LS Fest has been continuing every year in September.
2013 marks Holley's 110th anniversary.
Standard Equipment On Modern Race Cars.
In 2011 NASCAR decides to switch from carburetors to fuel injection systems for the 2012 Sprint Cup racing season. Holley's billet aluminum throttle bodies were selected in conjunction with a McLaren Electronic Systems and Freescale Semiconductor.
2012 Holley Hi-Ram intake manifold becomes standard equipment on GM COPO Camaros equipped with the LS7 aluminum block.
2012 Holley's Earl brand transmission coolers become standard equipment on GM COPO Camaros.
2013 Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became standard equipment used on all of Chevrolet Performance’s COPO Camaro factory-built race cars.
Bankruptcy Facts.
As of February 12, 2008, Holley filed for bankruptcy. The 2008 bankruptcy led Holley to transfer its equity to holders of $95 million in second-lien debt. During 2009 Holley closed a plant at Tijuana, Mexico, that made Hooker Headers, and transferred the work to Aberdeen, Mississippi. As of September 28, 2009, Holley filed for bankruptcy Chapter 11 protection.
Effective June 22, 2010, Holley emerged from bankruptcy protection.
In 2012, the private equity firm Monomoy Capital Partners acquired Holley Performance Products.

Wing Fort House

Wing Fort House is a historic house at Spring Hill Road in East Sandwich, Massachusetts.
The house was built in 1641 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
The Wing Fort House is recognized as the oldest home in New England continuously owned by the same family. Stephen Wing either purchased the homestead from the town of Sandwich, or the town granted him the property, around the time of his first marriage in 1646. His descendants continued to live in the home until 1942, when the last resident (Miss Cora M. Wing) sold the home to the Wing Family of America, Inc. 
Tradition states the home was at one time a fort to protect the earliest settlers from the Native Americans. The exterior of the "Old Fort" Room (which is the oldest part of the current structure) is composed of a double wall, which may have been filled in at one time. As the Cape Indians were found to be friendly, the town did not need any fort for protection.
The Fort House is now a museum, privately operated by the Wing Family of America, Inc. It is located at 69 Spring Hill Road (off of Route 6a), East Sandwich, Massachusetts. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from June 15 to September 30 from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and by appointment during the remainder of the year. There is a small admission fee.

Companies awarded with the title may opt to use the English equivalent 'Royal' instead.
In the Netherlands.
The Monarch has the right to appoint the royal title to a company or organisation.
To qualify for a nomination, the company or organization has to meet the following conditions:
As a rule, the Monarch will award only one Royal title per branch of business. Medical and financial corporations are excluded, as are organizations with political or religious goals.
In Belgium.
The King of the Belgians can appoint the title to a company or association that has been in existence in Belgium for at least fifty years, although rare exceptions are made in case of great importance for society.

John Upton (Spenser editor)

John Upton (1707–1760) was an English clergyman, academic and critic. An important early editor of Edmund Spenser, he is best known for the notes in his 1758 edition of Spenser's great romance epic "The Faerie Queene", which was first published in 1590 (books 1-3) and 1596 (books 4-6). 
Upton was educated at Oxford University, where he was for a while a college fellow. The notes in his edition of "The Faerie Queene" attempted to link the poem to events in Spenser's life, and characters in the poem with historical figures. 
Life.
Born at Taunton, he was the second son of James Upton and his wife Mary Proctor. He was educated by his father and at Merton College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1724. In 1728 he was elected fellow of Exeter College, graduating B.A. 1730, M.A. 1732. He resigned his fellowship in 1736. In 1732 Lord Powlett gave him the rectory of Seavington with Donnington, Somerset; later Earl Talbot gave him the rectory of Great Rissington, Gloucestershire. On 19 January 1637 he was admitted prebendary of Rochester, and he also held the sinecure rectory of Landrillo, Denbigh. 
Upton died unmarried at Taunton on 2 December 1760. Among his pupils at Oxford was Jonathan Toup.

Wianno Club is a historic club on Sea View Avenue in Osterville, Massachusetts. In 1916, a nine hole course was built on the original land purchase now occupied by holes numbered 13-18. The 16th was the first hole, and the Swan residence behind the hole was built as the original clubhouse. Additional land was assembled on the west side of Parker Road and north of West Bay Road and in 1919, Donald Ross was hired to redesign the original nine and to create a new nine. 
Former chief justice of the United States Supreme Court Charles Evans Hughes died in the Tiffany Cottage, just east of the main clubhouse.

Guides de la République Démocratique du Congo

Les Guides de la République Démocratique du Congo ("The Guides of the Democratic Republic of the Congo", GRDC; formerly "Association des Guides du Congo") is the national Guiding organization of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was founded in 1991 and became an associate member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) in July 2008. The association serves 7,784 girls (as of 2008).
History.
Guiding came to the then Belgian Congo in 1928 when first groups where started by Roman Catholic and Protestant missionaries. However, the first official unit was not founded until 1937 in Elisabethville. In 1950, the country was visited by Olave Baden-Powell, who met Scouts and Guides in Leopoldville. After the country's independence in 1960, the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts assisted the Guiding association in its membership application. During the 21st World Conference of WAGGGS in June 1972, the "Association des Guides du Zaire" ("Guides Association of Zaire") was accepted as an associated member. Only five months later, all youth organizations were banned by the government.
Guiding was restarted in 1991 under the name "Association des Guides du Congo" and rebuild with support from the Africa Region of WAGGGS. In 2008, Guiding was present in nine of the eleven provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The association was readmitted as an associate member of WAGGGS during WAGGGS' 33rd world conference in July 2008.

Welch v. Swasey

Welch v. Swasey, 214 U.S. 91 (1909), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the statutes of Massachusetts, chap. 333 of the Acts of 1904, and chap. 383 of the Acts of 1905, limiting the height of buildings in a certain quarter of a city, do not violate the Constitution of the United States.
Francis C. Welch owned property in a residential section of Boston where building height was legislatively limited to . In other, more commercial sections of the city, the legislation permitted building height up to . After he was denied a permit to construct a building on his property, Welch sued, contending “that the purposes of the acts are not such as justify the exercise of what is termed the police power, because, in fact, their real purpose was of an aesthetic nature, designed purely to preserve architectural symmetry and regular skylines.”
Delivering the opinion of the Court, Justice Rufus Wheeler Peckham acknowledged Welch's claim that “there is here a discrimination or classification between sections of the city,” but nonetheless adopted a standard of review very deferential to local government. “If the means employed, pursuant to the statute, have no real, substantial relation to a public object which government can accomplish, if the statutes are arbitrary and unreasonable, and beyond the necessities of the case, the courts will declare their invalidity,” wrote Peckham, also expressing that the Court “feels the greatest reluctance in interfering with the well-considered judgments of the courts of a state whose people are to be affected by the operation of the law.”
The reason for this reluctance was the Court's sense that, in such cases, the decision was location specific: “he particular circumstances prevailing at the place or in the state where the law is, to become operative … are all matters which the state court is familiar with; but a like familiarity cannot be ascribed to this court.” Although not entitled to absolute deference, such a state court judgment “is entitled to the very greatest respect, and will only be interfered with, in cases of this kind, where the decision is, in our judgment, plainly wrong.”

Beaconsfield Film Studios

Beaconsfield Film Studios is a British TV and film studio in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. The studios were operational as a production site for films from the 1922 and continued producing films - and, later, TV shows - until the 1960s. Britain's first talking movie was recorded there, as were films starring British actors Peter Sellers and John Mills. From 1971 onwards it has been the home of an internationally-recognised postgraduate school for film and TV production, famous as the birthplace of animated characters Wallace and Gromit.
History.
Life as a studio (1922 - 1970).
Construction and early years.
Construction began on the studio in 1921. The producer George Clark and the actor/director Guy Newall had been making films at a small studio on Ebury Street in Central London. They outgrew this and raised financing for a new, larger and more modern studio to be built in Beaconsfield. 
The studio opened in 1922, and Clark and Newall made several films there such as "Fox Farm". They also leased it out to independent companies to make films. The whole industry was badly hit by the Slump of 1924, and filmmaking at Beaconsfield ceased almost entirely. Clark and Newall later sold the studios to the British Lion Film Corporation.
British Lion Studios.
In the late 1920s, British Lion took over the studios producing a number of Edgar Wallace adaptations. Following the conversion to sound films in the 1920s, the company largely concentrated on making quota quickies with the occasional higher-budget film.
Crown Film Unit.
Following the outbreak of World War II, the GPO Film Unit became the Crown Film Unit. The Crown Film Unit was based at Beaconsfield Film Studios. Fifty-one productions are credited to the Crown Film Unit between 1940 and 1952 - when it was disbanded - although it is not known how many were actually filmed at Beaconsfield Film Studios.
Full list of Crown Film Unit productions, at IMDB
Independent Artists Studios.
After the Crown Film Unit was disbanded, the studios was known as Independent Artists Studios between 1958 and 1964, when it was run by the film production company Independent Artists (Production) Ltd., formed by Julian Wintle. Independent Artists made several films in these studios, including:
Several other films and TV shows are confirmed by IMDB as having been produced in the studios by other film production companies during that time:

It is likely that the production company 'Beaconsfield Productions', credited as producing The Vicious Circle, filmed other titles at IAS. IMDB lists a further sixteen productions credited to Beaconsfield Productions in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Life as a film school (1971 onwards).
The studios are now exclusively the home of the National Film and Television School, whose alumni have won numerous BAFTA awards and Oscars.
The National Film School (NFS).
The NFS was created in 1970 and in 1971 bought the studios to be its home, thanks to a loan from the Rank Organisation, producers of the Carry On film series and owners at the time of the nearby Pinewood Studios.
The National Film and Television School (NFTS).
It was renamed the National Film and Television School (NFTS) in 1982. The first Wallace and Gromit film, A Grand Day Out was started by Oscar winning director Nick Park whilst he was a student at NFTS, and like all works created at the school, the film is credited as being the copyright of NFTS.
Recent expansion.
NFTS students still use the original 1930s sound stage and 1960s TV studio building. To modernise and expand the teaching and administrative space, the NFTS commissioned Glen Howells Architects to design a three storey building (see photo). Upon its completion in 2008 it won a RIBA prize. In June 2009 it was formally named The Oswald Morris Building in honour of veteran cinematographer Ossie Morris.

<doc id="18679103" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18679103" title="Implicit self-esteem">
Implicit self-esteem

Implicit self-esteem refers to a person's disposition to evaluate themselves in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with "explicit self-esteem", which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit and implicit self-esteem are constituents of self-esteem.
Overview.
Implicit self-esteem has been specifically defined as "the introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) effect of the self-attitude on evaluation of self-associated and self-dissociated objects". Because by definition implicit self-esteem may not be accessible to conscious introspection, measures of implicit do not rely on direct self-reports, but rather infer the valence of associations with the self through other means. 
The vast majority of implicit self-esteem measures suggest that an individual's self-evaluation spills over to self-related objects. Also, these measures reveal that people, on average, have positive self-evaluations. The overestimation of one's traits and abilities is argued to be a spillover of positive affect from the self to objects associated with the self. This "spillover" is automatic and unconscious. Implicit self-esteem therefore offers an explanation of positivity bias for things related to the self. Associations are especially important; implicit self-esteem is made up of a series of associations between the self and a positive or negative evaluation of the self. This is especially shown in measures of the Implicit Association Test.
Factors influencing implicit self-esteem.
Several researchers have suggested that levels of implicit self-esteem can be affected by evaluative conditioning, through pairing of construct of the self with positive or negative stimuli, with the objective of altering attitude towards the self. In addition, social comparison, or more specifically the performance of people in one’s close social circle, can also affect implicit self-esteem. These information suggests that expectancies on social inclusion is a factor in self-evaluation.
Evaluative Conditioning.
The influence of evaluative conditioning on implicit self-esteem is analogous to the principles of classical conditioning on behavioral responses. Although the latter involves pairing an unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus repeatedly until presence of the neutral stimulus evokes the consequence of the unconditioned stimulus, evaluative conditioning involves pairing positive and negative stimulus with an internal construct- the self- to manipulate levels of implicit self-esteem. 
The effectiveness of evaluative conditioning hinges on the understanding that implicit self-esteem is interpersonally associative in nature, and that there is a causal relationship between the self and positive/negative social feedback. Studies have shown that participants repeatedly exposed to pairings of self-relevant information with smiling faces showed enhanced implicit self-esteem. 
In addition, studies have also found that pairing the word ‘I’ with positive traits heightens implicit self-esteem regardless of level of temporal self-esteem prior to the conditioning process. Subliminal presentation of the stimuli reflected that implicit self-esteem is altered in the absence of consciousness. Given that evaluative conditioning changes attitude at a fundamental level and the evaluation that is automatically activated on encountering the attitude object, implicit self-esteem could be assessed as attitude towards the self 
Social Comparison.
The Self-evaluation maintenance theory (SEM) suggests that a significant other’s success in self-relevant aspects can cause people to feel threatened, allowing comparison of one’s self to the self of another, impacting self-evaluation. Intimacy of relationships predicts likelihood of upward social comparison, which inevitably leads to lower implicit self-esteem. 
Given that the SEM is moderated by intimacy of relationship, its impact can be prominently witnessed between romantic partners. Evidence shows that men tend to have lowered implicit self-esteem when their romantic partners succeeded than when they failed, and that they automatically interpret their romantic partners’ success as their own failure. The underlying explanation might be that self-evaluation is driven by the fulfillment of ones’ gender role. Another explanation in line with the interpersonal nature of self-evaluation is stems from the belief that women are attracted to men’s success. Hence, the perception of failure in a man could be indicative of fear associated with acceptance from his significant other as well as abandonment issues. In general, studies on social comparison on implicit self-esteem has yielded the conclusion that comparisons with other individuals can impact one's self-esteem. In addition, these effects are greater when the individual being compared to is psychologically close to one.
Consequence of Implicit Self-esteem.
An individual's level of implicit self-esteem affects him or her in various crucial domains that are relevant to social, emotional, and cognitive well-being. In some cases, discrepancies between the implicit and explicit self-esteem affects affective well-being and are highly associated with clinical symptoms. Implicit self-esteem also determines how individuals approach relational conflicts and social settings. While low levels of implicit self-esteem can be erroneous, boosts in implicit self-esteem through mechanisms involved in narcissism can also impair an individual's performance in cognitive tasks, a external representation of competence in occupational settings. 
Damaged Self-Esteem.
Individuals with discrepancies between implicit and explicit self-esteem, more specifically a combination of high implicit and low explicit self-esteem, possess what psychologists call a damaged self-esteem. Damage self-esteem has been found to correlate with many clinical symptoms and disorders. In particular, the size of the discrepancy between implicit and explicit self-esteem in the direction of a damaged self-esteem has been found to correlate positively with heightened symptoms of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and loneliness. While implicit self-esteem itself is not correlated with these internalizing symptoms, the interaction between implicit and explicit self-esteem does. In particular, when individuals display low explicit self-esteem, their level of implicit self-esteem becomes directly and positively correlated with their level of suicidal ideation. This reflects the crucial role of implicit self-esteem in internalizing problems. We can understand the impact of a damaged self-esteem as an entrapment between goals, which stem from implicit self-esteem, and reality, which mediates explicit self-esteem. Indeed, damaged self esteem has been found to correlate with a maladaptive pattern of perfectionism, which is hinged upon rigidly high expectations that often contribute to failure. 
Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate positively with internet addiction, which underlying mechanism parallels that of clinical conditions such as bulimia nervosa. This occurrence of compulsions may be attributed to an automatic defense mechanism in which the individual avoids anxiety. However, the development of a damaged self-esteem as an avoidance mechanism can also precipitate difficulties in establishing a consistent self-view. 
Social Performance.
An important indicator of relationship stability and health is conflict behavior, the way individuals behave during a conflict. Peterson and DeHart found that Implicit self-esteem can regulate connection during times of relationship crises. Studies suggest that individuals with high implicit self-esteem tend to engage more in nonverbal positive behaviors during conflict when they perceive their partners to be committed. Positive nonverbal behaviors during conflict is extremely predictive of relationship outcomes such as commitment, satisfaction and stability. Also, implicit self-esteem also predicts sensitivity towards partners’ availability or support, even within a relationship-threat. That is, individuals high in implicit self-esteem tend to be implicitly motivated to consciously correct for connection and sensitivity to their partners’ effort, despite explicitly doubting their investment in the relationship. This ability to overcome relationship-threats as perpetuated by high levels of implicit self-esteem is crucial to relational well-being. 
In addition, low implicit self-esteem has also been found to precipitate uncertainty in self-concept. This instability in grasping the self is especially erroneous in regulation of behaviors in social situations. It has been shown that uncertainty about the self makes people vulnerable to holding and expressing minority opinions, especially those who are susceptible to self-threat (low self-esteem). Individuals with low implicit self-esteem tend to respond defensively to self-threats, and because minority opinions are more self-diagnostic than majority ones, individuals may hold these opinions to shield themselves from threat of uncertainty. 
'Gender Role
Gender differences play a vital role in implicit self- esteem in how its influenced by the performance or the significant other. 
Also, Women are more prone to trust their feelings and intuition, in contrast to men. The correlation between explicit and implicit self-esteem is greater for women then for men. Implicit self-esteem contains instinctive and empirical factors then people who are in touch with their feelings, which would report to have higher explicit self-esteem scores, which are consistent to implicit self-esteem scores. There were six studies that supported this idea, these results where held in three diverse cultures, two unlike measures of implicit self esteem. These ideas showed the correlation between implicit and explicit self esteem. This is higher for women then men.
Cognitive Performance.
Self-affirming activities that significantly raises implicit self-esteem, such as viewing one’s own Facebook profile page, has been shown to decrease motivation to do well in cognitive tasks of moderate difficulty. Results like this suggests that a peak in unconscious positivity associated with the self may discount an individual’s efforts to further proof his worth in other areas. Consequently, this leaves a an individual unmotivated to perform well in more practical settings. 
Measures of implicit self-esteem.
Implicit self-esteem is assessed using indirect measures of cognitive processing. These include the Name Letter Task and the Implicit Association Test. Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of, or control of, the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, they feature stimuli designed to represent the self, such as personal pronouns (e.g., "I") or letters in one's name.
Name–letter effect.
The name–letter effect is one of the widest used measures of implicit self-esteem. It represents the idea that an individual prefers the letters belonging to their own name and will select these above other letters in choice tasks. It seemingly occurs subconsciously, with the mere-exposure effect ruled out as a possible explanation.
This effect has been found in a vast range of studies. In one such scenario, participants were given a list of letters, one of which contained letters from their own name and the other of which contained other letters, and asked them to circle the preferred letter. This study found that, even when accounting for all other variables, letters belonging to the participants' own names were preferred. 
The Name Letter Test is a related measure for implicit self-esteem. This test is designed to rate the attractiveness of initials to someone’s name and the letters associated with their name. In contrast to the average attractiveness of those same initial to someone’s names and letters. Which people do not have a correlation with those initial or name letters would rate. This design technique is disorderly with overall letter liking. Response bias or overall letter liking for implicit self-esteem may mistake the results of this test. The proposal for another calculation method that is without confounds but still measures the influence of name letter assessment by supervising for the influence of not name letter liking and general liking the specific letters.
Similar results have been found in cross-cultural studies, using different alphabets.
It is important to note the difference between the name–letter effect and 'implicit egotism', the latter being attributed to the way people gravitate towards places, people and situations that reflect themselves, including perhaps similarities with their own name. Indeed, research into the topic has shown similarities between people's names and their future careers; for example, the names Dennis and Denise are overepresented among dentists.
Implicit Association Test.
The Implicit Association Test is an experimental method used within psychology to attempt to tap in to a person's automatic, or subconscious association between a concept and an attribute. It has been widely used in an attempt to uncover a person's subconscious prejudices against certain members of society, such as those who are overweight, as well as other implicit stereotypes and associations. The test was formatted in order to measure self-esteem. Participants are asked to make rapid responses, co-classifying themselves ("the self") and positive attributes, as well as negative attributes. The speed, or ease of these associations made is said to show a subconscious, or implicit preference for one attribute over another, with regards to the self.
Findings.
Many studies, have shown that the vast majority of people's implicit self-esteem is positively biased. That is, people find it a great deal easier to associate themselves with a positive concept than a negative one. Whether this is truly displaying implicit self-esteem is arguable; the findings may instead be linked with illusory superiority, in that people tend to rate themselves as above average on a number of scales.
Implicit Self Esteem 
In the study of, The validity and reliability of seven implicit self-esteem measures have been explored in this article. The implicit measures were not correlated with one another. However they did correlate only faintly with measures of explicit self-esteem. The implicit self measures confirmed partial reliabilities in correlation to good test-retest reliabilities. Nonetheless implicit measures were limited in their ability to calculate standard variables, for the test. Certain evidence explained that implicit self esteem measured are delicate to context, which is further argued in future research of implicit self-esteem.
Links with explicit self-esteem.
However, the validity of the Implicit Association Test and implicit self-esteem as a measure of self-esteem itself is questionable due to mixed evidence with regards to explicit self-esteem. On the one hand, researchers in a detailed and comprehensive study of implicit self-esteem found the IAT to correlate weakly, yet consistently, with measures of explicit self-esteem. However, more recent research has found measures of explicit self-esteem, such as questionnaires, to be independent of implicit self-esteem, providing an interesting insight into the validity of implicit self-esteem, explicit self-esteem, and the nature of self-esteem itself.

Silver Appleyard Duck

The Silver Appleyard Duck is a breed of domestic duck. Only 128 breeding Silver Appleyard Ducks were reported in a 2000 census of domestic waterfowl in North America. Of five people breeding this variety in North America, only one had a primary breeding flock in excess of fifty individuals. It may be more common in the United Kingdom.
This breed is sometimes called the Large Appleyard in contrast to the diminutive form of this breed known as the Miniature Appleyard developed by Tom Bartlett of Folly Farm in the 1980s.
Description.
The Silver Appleyard Duck is a "large, sturdily built duck" with a "blocky" physique and a prominent breast. When full grown it weighs between six and eight pounds.
Drakes of this breed have a yellow or greenish-colored bill which sometimes takes on a striated appearance when the duck is older. The drake has a chestnut red breast, flank, sides, and shoulders with white "frosting and lacing" and a "creamy or silvery white" underside. Drakes' wings are gray and white with a cross-stripe of bright blue. Their tail feathers are a dark bronze color. Feet and legs are orange.
The Silver Appleyard Duck hen has a yellow or orange bill with a black "bean". Plumage is whitish with markings in various shades of brown and gray. Her legs are yellow or orange with dark toenails and she, like the drake, also has wings marked with a blue cross-stripe.
The British Waterfowl Standards book lists criteria for an ideal example of this breed including (but not limited to) criteria such as:
History.
The Silver Appleyard is named after Reginald Appleyard, the breeder who developed it at his Priory Waterfowl Farm near Bury St Edmunds, England. As described in a farm brochure from the 1940s, Appleyard's ambition was to create a very attractive breed of large duck that would also be a prolific producer of large, white eggs.
The breed was introduced to the United States in the 1960s but did not become available to the public until 1984. In 1998, the American Poultry Association held a qualifying meet to include the Silver Appleyard Duck in the American Standard of Perfection. In 2000, the association officially recognized this breed.
Modern cultivation.
Silver Appleyard Ducks are raised for exhibition, as pets, and as "gourmet roasting ducks". They are also raised for their eggs as this breed is one of the best egg-layers among the larger ducks and produces, on average, roughly 250 white-shelled eggs yearly. Their meat is "lean and flavorful". This breed has a calm temperament and tends to stay close to home if well-fed.
According to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy:
There is a critical need for more conservation breeders of Appleyards. Their excellent laying ability, meaty carcasses, and lovely plumage make them a great addition to any small farmstead or backyard producer's flock...When choosing Appleyards to breed, select robust, active, and strong-legged birds that have a record of good egg production. Many Appleyards are undersized, therefore select birds with big well muscled bodies while avoiding excessively large birds that will have trouble foraging, mating, and laying.

<doc id="18679180" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18679180" title="Acoustic Seabed Classification">
Acoustic Seabed Classification

Acoustic seabed classification is the partitioning of a seabed acoustic image into discrete physical entities or classes. This is a particularly active area of development in the field of seabed mapping, marine geophysics, underwater acoustics and benthic habitat mapping. Seabed classification is one route to characterizing the seabed and its habitats. Seabed characterization makes the link between the classified regions and the seabed physical, geological, chemical or biological properties. Acoustic seabed classification is possible using a wide range of acoustic imaging systems including multibeam echosounders, sidescan sonar, single-beam echosounders, interferometric systems and sub-bottom profilers. Seabed classification based on acoustic properties can be divided into two main categories; surficial seabed classification and sub-surface seabed classification. Sub-surface imaging technologies use lower frequency sound to provide higher penetration, whereas surficial imaging technologies provide higher resolution imagery by utilizing higher frequencies (especially in shallow water).
Surficial seabed classification is concerned primarily with distinguishing marine benthic habitat characteristics (e.g. hard, soft, rough, smooth, mud, sand, clay, cobble) of the surveyed area. Multibeam echosounders, sidescan sonar systems and acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS) are the most commonly used technologies. Multibeam systems acquire both bathymetry (depth) and backscatter (intensity) data, with full bottom coverage possible. Multibeam backscatter was previously considered to be a by-product of a multibeam survey, with bathymetry being the primary information. Recent advances in multibeam backscatter processing and analysis methods have increased the range of applications for which multibeam systems can be used. New methods of analyzing backscatter data, have increased its potential for seabed characterization. Backscatter data resolution has also increased significantly with the introduction of snippet data. Snippet data is raw backscatter time-series data for each beam footprint and each ping (Lockhart et. al., 2007). This has allowed multibeam backscatter data to be of a quality comparable to that of sidescan sonar imagery. 
Different approaches to seabed classification can give different results depending on the algorithms used. These include image-based seabed classification methods such as texture analysis, artificial neural networks (ANN); and others such as angular response characterization (Hughes-Clarke et al., 1997). One well established approach is to adapt image processing methods traditionally used in satellite remote sensing to quantitatively analyze the multibeam backscatter intensity data. After image segmentation and classification, acoustic imagery can be used to discriminate between areas with different morphological properties. A fundamental point to note when using any classification method is that, no classification map is 100% accurate and some attempt must always be made to assess the accuracy (e.g. confusion matrix).
The classification map needs to be subject to ground-verification in order to identify the class compositions and bottom type. The functionality of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to integrate data from different sources, for example, integrating with ground truth data. This includes in-situ sediment grab sampling, the use of a dredge, trawl net, visual imagery or surveys using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The seabed classification map can be combined with other acoustically (or other method) derived information about the area, such as fish distribution and abundance or vegetation characteristics, to establish habitat groups based on the associations. This allows classification maps derived from multibeam data to help characterize the seabed and more effectively manage its use.
The use of optical sensors has been restricted to depths less than 40 m due to absorption of electromagnetic radiation by water. Most recently, processing tools have been developed to classify data acquired using airborne bathymetric LiDAR systems, (QTC, 2008). Nevertheless, acoustics remain the preferred method of imaging the seafloor as data can be acquired over a much larger area (than in-situ sampling) from almost any depth. 
Sub-surface seabed classification is commonly referred to as sub-bottom profiling and is generally used for geological assessment of the sub-surface characteristics, down to hundreds of meters, as necessary in the exploration for oil deposits.

Jean Druys

Jean Druys (Latin Drusius) (b. at Cumptich, near Tienen; d. 25 March 1635) was a Belgian Norbertine canon regular and 30th Abbot of Parc Abbey.
Life.
He studied successively at Sint-Truiden, Liège, Namur, and Leuven, and entered the Norbertine Abbey of Parc in 1587. Ordained priest, he was sent to the Norbertine College at the Catholic University of Leuven and obtained his licentiate in 1595. 
Recalled to the abbey, he was made sub-prior and professor of theology to the young religious at the abbey, chaplain to Abbot Ambrose Loots at the Refuge, which the abbey possessed at Brussels during the troubled times at the end of the sixteenth century, and at the death of Abbot Loots his successor. Four years later he was appointed vicar-general to the Abbot-General of Prémontré Abbey, and was later named by Archduke Albert a member of the States of Brabant and of his private council. 
The University of Leuven having suffered much from the religious and political disturbances of the time, Druys was appointed, with a layman, visitor to the university, with full power to reform abuses, a task which was not completed until 1617. He was also made visitor to the University of Douai (1616) and to the Celestine monastery at Héverlé. In addition he restored and enlarged his own abbey, which had suffered much from the vandalism of the soldiers, and provided better educational advantages for his religious. 
At the general chapter held at Prémontré in 1628, Abbot Druys was commissioned to revise the statutes of the order and conform them to the prescriptions of the Council of Trent, a revision which was approved at the general chapter of 1630. Druys prefixed a preface, "Praefatio ad omnes candidissimi et canonici ordinis religiosos", which Johannes Franciscus Foppens characterizes as "longam, piam, eruditam". He had a tree of the saints of the order made by the skilful engraver, C. Mallery. He also published a small work entitled "Exhortatio ad candidi ordinis religiosos". 
Abbot Druys was deputed by the general chapter of 1630 to bring back several abbeys of Spain into union and observance, but was unsuccessful. While on this mission he conferred with Philip IV of Spain on the sad state of affairs in Brabant. A ring presented to him by this monarch is preserved at Parc, as is also a letter from Henrietta Maria, Queen of England.

Cetteus

Saint Cetteus (or "Ceteus", also known as "Peregrinus, Pelligrinus, Pellegrino") (d. June 13, 597) () is the patron saint of Pescara. He was a bishop of the 6th century, elected to the see of Amiternum in Sabina (today the city of San Vittorino) in 590, during the pontificate of Gregory the Great. 
According to a largely legendary "Passio", during Cetteus’ episcopate, Amiternum was occupied by two Lombard captains, Alai and Umbolus. Cetteus, because he refused to support this occupation, fled to Rome. Pope Gregory convinced Cetteus to return, however, after receiving a promise from the Lombards that they would treat the city's inhabitants with humanity. However, a dispute broke out between Alai and Umbolus, and Alai sided with Count Verilianus of Orte, who occupied Amiternum at night. When the city’s inhabitants woke up to this occupation, they wanted to kill Alai, but Cetteus intervened, and Alai was simply imprisoned but not killed. Umbolus, meanwhile, believed that Cetteus was an ally of Alai, and ordered the bishop's immediate execution. 
He was executed by having a large stone tied around his neck, being thrown off a bridge and into the Aterno-Pescara. His body floated to Pescara, where it was discovered by fishermen. They buried the body, whose vestments they recognized as those of a bishop, but not knowing the bishop's name, they called him Peregrinus ("Peregrino"), meaning "traveler" or "pilgrim." The saint's name was eventually discovered, and the body was buried in the church in Pescara that was later dedicated to him, San Cetteo. This church is now Pescara Cathedral.
Although largely legendary, the "Passio" is probably correct in placing Cetteus' death at the time of the Lombard invasion.

Unpaired electron

In chemistry, an unpaired electron is an electron that occupies an orbital of an atom singly, rather than as part of an electron pair. As the formation of electron pairs is often energetically favourable, either in the form of a chemical bond or as a lone pair, unpaired electrons are relatively uncommon in chemistry, because an entity that carries an unpaired electron is usually rather reactive. In organic chemistry they typically only occur briefly during a reaction on an entity called a radical; however, they play an important role in explaining reaction pathways.
Radicals are uncommon in s- and p-block chemistry, since the unpaired electron occupies a valence p orbital or an sp, sp2 or sp3 hybrid orbital. These orbitals are strongly directional and therefore overlap to form strong covalent bonds, favouring dimerisation of radicals. Radicals can be stable if dimerisation would result in a weak bond or the unpaired electrons are stabilised by delocalisation. In contrast, radicals in d- and f-block chemistry are very common. The less directional, more diffuse d and f orbitals, in which unpaired electrons reside, overlap less effectively, form weaker bonds and thus dimerisation is generally disfavoured. These d and f orbitals also have comparatively smaller radial extension, disfavouring overlap to form dimers.
The more stable entities with unpaired electrons do exist, e.g. the nitric oxide molecule has one. According to Hund's rule, the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned parallel and this gives these molecules paramagnetic properties.
The most stable examples of unpaired electrons are found on the atoms and ions of lanthanides. The incomplete f-shell of these entities does not interact very strongly with the environment they are in and this prevents them from being paired. The ion with the largest number of unpaired electrons is Gd3+ with seven unpaired electrons.

Rabbi Moshe Heinemann is an Orthodox rabbi and Posek who heads the Agudath Israel of Baltimore synagogue and is the rabbinical supervisor of the Star K kashrus certification agency. He studied for many years in Beis Midrash Govoha under Rabbi Aharon Kotler, and was ordained by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. 
Rabbi Heinemann is widely consulted for rulings in matters of Halacha, often where complicated technology is involved. He is an expert Mohel, Shochet, and Sofer, and has trained and certified numerous people in these, as well as other, areas of practical Halacha. Rabbi Heinemann is also an expert on the construction of Eruvin and mikvehs, and is frequently consulted regarding these complicated areas of Halacha.
Shabbos Mode Ovens.
Rabbi Heinemann has ruled for over a decade that, on Yom Tov, one may raise or lower the temperature on Sabbath Mode ovens. In June 2008, a number of prominent Poskim signed a Kol Koreh (public pronouncement) stating that this was unequivocally forbidden. The Kol Koreh referred to the lenient opinion as a Daas Yachid (a minority opinion that should not be relied upon - literally: the opinion of an individual). After the Kol Koreh was released, it was rumored by some that Rabbi Heineman retracted his opinion regarding this issue and ruled like the Israeli Poskim. However, no written record of his retraction exists, and the website of the Star-K, the Supervision Agency that is governed by rabbi Heinemann's rulings, continues to promote Rabbi Heinemann's view. 
It has been noted, however, that Rabbi Heinemann's opinion is consistent with the rulings of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach regarding electricity. Indeed, none of Rabbi Auerbach's sons or sons-in-law, including Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach, Rabbi Ezriel Auerbach, and Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg, all prominent Poskim in their own right, participated in the Kol Koreh.

Fiji's World Cup run finished in the quarter-finals in a 37-20 loss to South Africa.
Railomo earned four more caps since then, holding 10 caps for his national side.
Death.
Railomo died in the early hours of 8 August 2009 after being hospitalized a few days earlier because of a sickness. He was 28.

Wildwood Cemetery

Wildwood Cemetery is a historic cemetery at Palmer and Wildwood Streets in Winchester, Massachusetts.
The cemetery was founded in 1851 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. This cemetery was started using part of the $3000.00 gift from Colonel William P. Winchester that was donated on condition that the town be named after him.
Notable persons buried in the cemetery include Massachusetts Governor Samuel Walker McCall (1851-1923), Rev. Howard James Chidley (1878-1966), engineer Harold Kilbrith Barrows (1873-1954), linguist Joshua Whatmough (1897-1964), artist Joseph Foxcroft Cole (1837-1892), and artist Dana Pond (1881-1962).

Henry Elderfield

Professor Henry "Harry" Elderfield, FRS, (born 1943), is Professor of Ocean Geochemistry and Palaeoclimate Research at the Godwin Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, Cambridge University. He made his name in ocean chemistry and palaeochemistry, using trace metals and isotopes in biogenic carbonate as palaeochemical tracers, and studying the chemistry of modern and ancient oceans - especially those of the glacial epoch and the Cenozoic.
Education and career.
Harry Elderfield attended the University of Liverpool obtaining a BSc in Chemistry (Oceanography) in 1965. He worked as a Research Fellow in the Geology Department, Imperial College, London between 1968-1969 whilst completing his PhD at the University of Liverpool in 1970. 
He was appointed a Lecturer in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Leeds in 1969, a position he held until 1982. From 1982 until 1989 he held the post of Assistant Director in Research in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge. During this time he obtained an MA from the University of Cambridge in 1985, followed by his ScD in 1989. The same year, he was made a Reader in Geochemistry at Cambridge, before being appointed to the chair of Professor of Ocean Geochemistry and Paleochemistry (Cambridge) in 1999.
Early career.
His early career saw him working on the behaviour of trace metals in oceans and their sediments, and in fluid flow through the ocean crust and sediments under the influence of off-axis hydrothermal circulation. He became one of the first low-temperature geochemists to appreciate how radiogenic isotopes might be used to solve the problems of marine geochemistry, developing the seawater strontium isotope curve for the Cenozoic – now the most reliable isotopic record available for the Phanerozoic. 
He has also worked on iodine speciation in seawater and porewaters, the separation of cerium from other rare earth elements in a classic example of redox behaviour; he has developed a precise mass spectrometric analysis method – and made the first ever measurements of oceanic profiles for – 10 rare earth elements. The rare earths are now widely used as tracers in sedimentary geochemistry and palaeoceanography.
Current Research.
Harry Elderfield's research focuses on ocean chemistry and paleochemistry, and his results have had a far-reaching impact on geochemistry. He has contributed significantly to marine chemistry, most notably the fate of metals in hydrothermal processes, the formation of manganese nodules, and the biogeochemical cycles of elements including iodine and strontium.
His current interests include defining chemical proxies from biogenic carbonates and using them to understand the ancient ocean. He has pioneered the development of foraminiferal magnesium thermometry, which has become accepted for the estimation of past ocean temperatures.

Beacon Street Tomb

The Beacon Street Tomb is a historic receiving tomb in the Lakeside Cemetery of Wakefield, Massachusetts. It is a single story Greek Revival structure built of ashlar granite. On its south elevation, which faces Beacon Street, there are four Doric columns supporting a pedimented gable with a louvered oculus window. There are no windows, and a double-leaf door on the southern elevation. The structure was used to store caskets during the winter months when burial was impossible due to frozen ground.
The tomb was built in 1858 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
