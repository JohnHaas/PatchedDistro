George Wilson Cup

The George Wilson Memorial Cup is a competition open to reserve football teams affiliated to member clubs of the Irish League. Initially it was open to all members of the B Division, both "attached and unattached" (i.e. reserve sides and independent intermediate clubs), but since 1977/78 it has been limited to reserve sides only.
History.
Founded in the 1952/53 season in memory of Crusaders official, George Wilson, the final has been traditionally held at Crusaders' home ground Seaview (with a few exceptions when matches have been held at Taylor's Avenue (Carrickfergus), Ballymena Showgrounds and Mourneview Park). Appropriately, the first winners were Crusaders Reserves.
The format has varied over the years between league format, straight knock-out and group format.

Lindrick

Lindrick was an ancient district of England. The majority of the district appears to have lain in what is now South Yorkshire, but the village of Carlton-in-Lindrick is in Nottinghamshire.
The name of the district is derived from the Old English for "raised, straight strip marked by lime trees".
Lindrick seems to have reached as far as Lindrick Dale, Laughton Lindrick wood, which lay next to Roche Abbey, and the Lindrick area of Tickhill.

<doc id="18751756" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18751756" title="Fiber roll">
Fiber roll

A fiber roll is a temporary erosion control and sediment control device used on construction sites to protect water quality in nearby streams, rivers, lakes and seas from sediment erosion. It is made of straw, coconut fiber or similar material formed into a tubular roll.
Each horizontal contour level row of fiber rolls is installed on slopes, ending with one at the base of the slope, below an active construction area before soil disturbance (earth moving) begins. The space between each row of fiber roll is dependent on the steepness of the slope. The steeper the slope, the more rows of evenly spaced horizontal contour level fiber rolls are used. Each fiber roll is installed on a horizontal contour level in shallow trenches 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) deep and fastened to the ground with wooden stakes.
Properly installed fiber rolls are effective at trapping sediment, generally more effectively than straw bales. During rain storms, the rolls intercept surface stormwater runoff (but not concentrating or channeling the runoff) and reduce the velocity of flow. Water passes through a fiber roll while leaving behind the sediment on the uphill side of the roll, thereby reducing sediment erosion.
Limitations.
Fiber Rolls have several limitations to their uses:

Ashraful Haque

Syed Ashraful Haq is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He was the architect of Bangladesh's first ever ICC Trophy victory, over Fiji in May 1979. His 7/23 from 9.2 overs completely destroyed the Fiji middle order, leading Bangladesh to a 22 run win. He was also a member of the Bangladesh side that played in the historic match at Dhaka against the MCC in January 1977. A right hand batsman and an off break bowler, Ashraful remained an integral part of the national side until his retirement in 1981-82 season.
ICC Trophy.
The Water Orton Cricket Club ground, in Birmingham, was the unlikely setting for Bangladesh's first-ever international cricket match abroad. On May 24, 1979, Bangladesh played against Fiji in the first ICC Trophy tournament. Bangladesh were the firm favorites, yet batting first they only scored 103 all out. An upset looked on the cards, until Syed Ashraful came on to bowl. The magic of his spin completely mesmerized the Pacific islanders. From 40/2, Fiji collapsed to 81 all out. It was at that time the best figures for a Bangladeshi bowler in international cricket, until Obaidul Haq Azam improved the figures with his 7/18 against the MCC. It was also the record for best bowling in the ICC Trophy. Ole Mortensen, the Danish and Derbyshire fast bowler improved the figures with 7/19 against Israel in Kenya, 1994.
Ashraful had an impressive ICC Trophy with both bat and ball. He used his long experience in English conditions to great effect. As well as his success with the ball, he played several useful innings: 23 against Canada, 22 against Malaysia and 31 against Denmark.
Other international matches.
He was a part of the Bangladesh team that played in the historical game against the MCC at Dhaka in January 1977. He failed in the match, but he did score 68 for East Zone at Chittagong. In fact, he seemed to have a special liking for Chittagong. A year later, against test standard Sri Lankan side he scored 42 and 49, and captured 2 wickets for 70 runs at Chittagong.
He retired from international cricket after the 1981-82 season.
In domestic cricket.
He played most of his club cricket at Dhaka with the Azad Boys club. In national cricket, he became the first player to score a double hundred, scoring 214 for Bangladesh Shipping Corporation in 1981-82 season.
As a cricket administrator.
Syed Ashraful Haque is currently the chief executive officer of the Asian Cricket Council.

Camp Greentop Historic District

Camp Greentop is located in Catoctin Mountain Park near Thurmont, Maryland. The camp was built by the Works Progress Administration labor program in the development of what was then known as the Catoctin Mountain Recreational Development Area, and comprises 22 rustic log buildings including sleeping cabins, administrative buildings and lodges. All were built between 1934 and 1938. The buildings are a simplified version of the National Park Service Rustic style. The camp was originally to duplicate the design of Camp Misty Mount, but was modified during construction for use by the Baltimore League for Crippled Children, making it one of the first handicap-accessible facilities in the United States. Greentop is presently used by organized youth groups.
The camp was designed to accommodate 150 people, organized into units of 30. As a matter of policy, a swimming pool was provided, as no natural alternative existed. The cabins with siding exteriors used "waney board" siding, with boards cut from untrimmed logs, resulting in irregular, wavy or "waney" edges. The design modifications at Greentop to accommodate handicapped children reduced capacity to 98.
Greentop is also known as Camp 2: Camp 1 is Camp Misty Mount and Camp 3, originally called Camp Hi-Catoctin and located at a much higher elevation, became Camp David.

Trona, San Bernardino County, California

Trona is an unincorporated community in San Bernardino County, California. In 2000 it had a population of 2,742. Trona is at the western edge of Searles Lake, a dry lake bed in Searles Valley, southwest of Death Valley. The town takes its name from the mineral trona, abundant in the lakebed.
It is about northeast of Los Angeles, on State Route 178. The ZIP code is 93562.
Trona is known for its isolation and desolation, as well as the nearby Trona Pinnacles. The local school plays on a dirt football field because the searing heat and highly saline soil kills grass. At one point it boasted an 18 hole golf course that was all sand except for the "greens", which were a softer grade of brown colored dirt.
History.
Starting in the late 1800s mining industry set up around Searles Dry Lake to mine borax.
Trona was officially established in 1913, as a self-contained company town, wholly operated by its resident mining company to house employees. Employees were paid in company scrip instead of cash. The mining company also built a library, a scrip-accepting for-profit grocery store, a school, basic housing, and minimal recreation facilities. The Trona Railway was built in 1913–14 to provide the town with a rail connection to the Southern Pacific (now the Union Pacific) line at Searles. The railway still operates today.
Economic booms and busts followed. Its most notable boom occurred during World War I, when Trona was the only reliable American source of potash, an important element used in the production of gunpowder.
Today, Searles Valley Minerals Inc.'s soda ash processing plant remains the largest firm in town. Other operations nearby include evaporative salt extraction from the dry lake bed's surface, and a lime quarry. Searles Valley Minerals is the largest employer in Trona, and many employees live in Ridgecrest, California, commuting daily to Trona.
Trona also serves as the headquarters and base of operations for the Trona Railway, a short-line railroad.
Trona High School has 162 students and competes as the Tornadoes. It has the only dirt American football field in the United States outside of Alaska.
A number of Hollywood films have been shot in the surrounding desert (particularly around the Trona Pinnacles), including "" and "Planet of the Apes". In the 2000s, the town itself served as the setting for two films, "Trona" (2005), "Just Add Water" (2008) and "Lost Lake" (2012).

Neftalí Feliz

Neftalí Feliz Antonio (; born May 2, 1988) is a Dominican right-handed pitcher for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball. Feliz was the Rangers best prospect according to "Baseball America", and one of the top five pitching prospects in baseball at the start of 2010. His best pitch is his fastball, which consistently hits the upper-90s and can reach triple digits.
Professional career.
Minor Leagues.
Feliz was signed by the Atlanta Braves as a free agent out of the Dominican Republic in 2005. On July 31, 2007 he was traded from the Braves to the Texas Rangers along with Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Matt Harrison, Beau Jones, and Elvis Andrus for Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay.
Texas Rangers (2009-present).
2009.
Feliz was called up to the majors for the first time on August 2, 2009. He made his debut on August 3, striking out four in two scoreless innings. He finished the season with a 1–0 record and a 1.74 earned run average in 20 games, with 39 strikeouts and two saves in 31 innings pitched.
2010.
After two blown saves by Frank Francisco to start the 2010 baseball season, Feliz replaced him as the Rangers' closer.
On July 4, 2010, Feliz was named to his first MLB All-Star Game. He was accompanied by teammates Vladimir Guerrero, Josh Hamilton, Ian Kinsler, Elvis Andrus, and the newly acquired Cliff Lee. However, Feliz did not pitch during the game.
On September 1, 2010, Feliz threw a fastball recorded at 103.4 mph, currently the 3rd fastest any pitcher has ever thrown (behind Aroldis Chapman and Joel Zumaya).
On September 25, 2010, Feliz earned his 38th save of the season, breaking the single-season record for saves by a rookie. He would go on to finish the season with 40. The previous record was held by Kazuhiro Sasaki of the Seattle Mariners, with 37 in 2000.
During Game 6 of the 2010 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, Feliz got the final three outs in the 9th inning and sent the Rangers to the World Series for the first time in franchise history. On October 30, 2010, Feliz went three up, three down to close a 4–2 Rangers win in Game 3 of the World Series, making him the second youngest player to record a save in the World Series. The Texas Rangers lost the World Series to the San Francisco Giants in 5 games.
On November 15, 2010, Feliz was awarded the 2010 American League Rookie of the Year Award.
He was also named the closer on "Baseball America"'s 2010 All-Rookie Team and the Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.
2011.
In 2011, he was 2–3 with a 2.74 ERA, and 32 saves (5th in the American League, and tied for 9th-most in Rangers history). During Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, with two outs, two strikes, and two runners on, Feliz blew a save as he surrendered a 2-run triple to David Freese, who would then homer later to seal a Cardinals 10-9 win in the 11th inning. The Rangers then lost their second straight World Series appearance after losing Game 7 to the Cardinals 2-6.
2012.
With the addition of veteran closer Joe Nathan, the Texas Rangers transitioned Feliz into the starting rotation for the 2012 season. His first start came on April 10 against the Seattle Mariners. He pitched 7 shutout innings, only giving up 4 hits and 2 walks with 4 strikeouts in a 1-0 victory. On May 21, 2012, Feliz was placed on the 60-day disabled list due to a sprained UCL. After several rehab appearances Feliz underwent Tommy John surgery on August 1, 2012. In 8 games (7 starts), Feliz went 3-1 with a 3.16 ERA during his injury-shortened 2012 year.
2013.
Feliz began the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list due to still recovering from the Tommy John surgery he previously had. On September 1 Feliz was activated from the disabled list with the intention to use him in low-leverage situations. He pitched later that night in a long cause to the Minnesota Twins, pitching 1 2/3 innings of relief. Feliz finished the season with only six appearances in which he did not give up a run and struck-out four.

Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Auckland Thistle, Petone, Christchurch Thistle, and Northern (Dunedin).
The 1934 final.
The final was accompanied by highland dancers and pipe bands, celebrating what became known as the "Scottish final", due to the names of the two teams involved. Christchurch was the first team to score through a header from J. Adam, and almost had a second, with a goal late in the first half being disallowed. Auckland had the better of the second half, however, and the scores were levelled by a G. Sutherland own goal (this goal is sometimes credited to Wally Watson). The winning goal from Les Wood came five minutes from full time. The match was refereed by G. Jackson, who made his third appearance as officiator of the final, having also refereed in both 1927 and 1928.

Square René-Viviani

The Square René Viviani (Official French name: "Square René Viviani-Montebello") is a public square adjacent to the Church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre in the fifth arrondissement of Paris.
Location.
The Square René Viviani is located to the north of the Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre church, which is a Melkite Greek Catholic parish church resident in one of the oldest religious buildings in the city. The square is an irregular polygon in shape, bounded by the Rue Galande and church buildings to the south; by the Rue Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre on the west; by the Quai de Montebello to the north; and by the Rue Lagrange and the Rue du Fouarre on the east. The Rue de la Bûcherie ends on the western side of the square, but it resumes its course on the eastern side, and the Pont au Double, a bridge to the Île de la Cité, lies across the Quai de Montebello from the square. The Square René Viviani offers one of the best views of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in all of Paris.
Around the corner, in the Rue Bûcherie, stands the well-known English-language bookshop, Shakespeare and Company
Inside the square, there are two features, other than the lawns, walkways, well-trimmed plane trees, and benches, that deserve a mention here. There is an odd-looking fountain, known as the Saint Julien fountain, that was erected in 1995. It is the work of the French sculptor, Georges Jeanclos (1933–1997), and it is emblematic of the legend of St. Julien the Hospitaller, a tale, now largely discounted, involving a curse by witches, a talking deer, a case of mistaken identity, an horrific crime, several improbable coincidences, and a supernatural intervention. The story was told and retold during the Middle Ages, and it became a favorite. Consequently, hospitals, hospices, and churches all over Europe adopted Julien as their patron. He was also a patron saint of hunters, innkeepers, and ferrymen; traveling pilgrims often prayed for his help in finding comfortable lodgings.
The other feature worthy of note is an ancient tree that is surrounded by a circular curbstone. Its significance is described below.
History.
Before 1909, this plot was occupied by one of the annexes of the Hôtel-Dieu, the ancient Paris hospital on the nearby Île de la Cité. In even earlier times, monastic buildings, dormitories and a refectory belonging to the Clunesian priory of St. Julien, occupied this site. Earlier still, this place was a cemetery established next to a 6th-century basilica, the original Church of St. Julien. Merovingian-era graves and tombs were excavated near the walls of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre during the 19th century. Some of the relics are now in the Carnavalet Museum.
Here and there on the square, there are odd pieces of carved stone. They are pieces of architectural rubble salvaged from the Cathedral of Notre Dame, when, during the 19th century, the exterior of the cathedral was partially restored by the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Many of the most seriously degraded pieces of carved limestone were replaced by newly carved reproductions, and the older pieces were eventually deposited here.
The square is noted for being the site of the oldest planted tree in Paris. The "robinia pseudoacacia", a species commonly known as a locust tree, is believed to have been planted by its namesake, Jean Robin (1550–1620), in 1601; if so, it has now been standing on the "rive gauche" for over four hundred years. It is presently supported by two concrete crutches. The tree lost its upper branches to a shell during World War I, but it proves its continuing vitality by blooming every year. Despite some speculation about its true age, it is universally recognized as the oldest tree in the city.

The Square René Viviani was named for the former French prime minister, René Viviani (1863–1925), and it was opened for public enjoyment in 1928.

John Ellwood Madill (15 January 1915 – 5 December 1999) was a Progressive Conservative party member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was born in Melancthon, Ontario.
From 1952 to 1957, he was a municipal councillor for Mono Township, subsequently its deputy reeve to 1959, then reeve from that point until 1963. In 1962, he was warden of Dufferin County.
Elwood Madill was an insurance agent in Orangeville, Ontario when he won the local Progressive Conservative nomination for the Dufferin—Simcoe riding on 16 February 1963. Madill won that seat in the federal election later that year. He was re-elected to a second term in 1965.
Due to riding boundary realignments in 1966, Madill campaigned in the newly formed Peel—Dufferin—Simcoe riding in the 1968 election but lost to Bruce Beer of the Liberal party. Beer only served one term in Parliament before Madill won back Peel—Dufferin—Simcoe in the 1972 federal election. However, after his term in the 29th Parliament, Madill left federal political office after his defeat to Ross Milne in the 1974 federal election.
Besides his insurance practice, Madill was also a businessman and farmer during his career.

Power tower (exercise)

A power tower, also known as a knee raise station, and sometimes referred to as a captain's chair, is a piece of exercise equipment that allows one to build upper body and abdominal muscle strength. When only the forearm pads alone are used for performing abdominal exercises usually referred to as simply 'the captain's chair.' The captain's chair requires minimal arm strength as it is stable and movement occurs in the hips and torso. The equipment commonly has a backrest and forearm rests that form the chair, with vertical handles at the ends of the arm rests. The word "power" comes from the addition of other powerful arm exercises such as parallel horizontal handles for performing dips, a pull-up bar is attached to the top for chin-ups and pull-ups, and push-up handles are usually found on the bottom for Atlas ("deep") push-ups.
Exercises:
The knee raise exercise will work the lower abdominals, and can also work the obliques (see abdominal external oblique muscle and abdominal internal oblique muscle) if you twist your torso during the exercise.
Advanced users may increase resistance by wearing a weighted vest, ankle weights, holding a dumbbell between the feet, kettlebells on the toes, a resistance band tied from one's feet to the bottom of the tower, or other heavy weights.

Pe'er Visner (born 1957) is an Israeli politician who is deputy mayor of Tel Aviv and is chair of the Israeli Green Party.
Visner strongly opposed a 2006 resolution by the United States Green Party calling for divestment from Israel. Visner wrote, "We are very disappointed that our sister party in the US did not consult with the Israel Green Party before passing this resolution. We hope that this breach in trust between our entities will be remedied with an apology and appropriate action by the US Greens."
In May 2008, Visner opposed a proposal to allow the Nokia Arena to be used for private functions, including weddings, as a way to recoup renovation costs. Visner argued that it was "not appropriate" to rent out the stadium for private use.
In October 2011, Visner was convicted of forgery and fraud. According to the prosecution, Visner had forged a document allowing him to pay significantly lower municipal fees for space he rented in Tel Aviv.

Cancer rates in Israel are the highest in the world, because of pollution produced by industry. Factories cause more deaths than all the wars, and the threat is increasing. We have no clean rivers left to swim in, but industrial effluent and sewage continue to flow into Israel's streams. Our youth go to the army for three years, then come back to find that someone has stolen their beach. We're not leaving anything of our beloved land of Israel for the next generation. —Peter Visner, "The Jewish Community Online"

Joy Williams (Australian writer)

Joy Williams (born Eileen Williams; a.k.a. Joyce Riley Williams, Joy Williams Wiradjuri, Janaka Wiradjuri) (born 13 September 1942 in Sydney; died 22 September 2006 in Primbee, New South Wales, Australia) was an Aboriginal Australian author of poetry.
Biography.
Joy Williams was born Eileen Williams at the Crown Street Women's Hospital in Sydney. Joy was born illegitimate so her mother gave her to Bomaderry Home. At the age of six she was sent to the Lutanda Children's Home run by the Plymouth Brethren, first at Wentworth Falls and later to Pennant Hills, Sydney. Williams was sent to Lutanda, where she was the only indigenous resident, rather than the Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls because of her fair skin. Williams went to Hornsby Girls' High School and then at the insistence of the Brethren was sent to the Nurses' Home at Parramatta District Hospital at sixteen to become a nurses aide. She was later sent to the North Ryde Psychiatric ward and while on weekend leave she became pregnant with her first child, a daughter. Being heavily sedated Williams was forced to sign adoption papers.
In the 1970s Williams received her birth certificate and eventually met her mother. She enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts, English/History at Wollongong University and was the Regional Representative of the Aboriginal Consultative Group. Williams was actively involved with the Aboriginal Community Centre and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Her interest was in Black Literature and hoped that one day this would be taught at all levels throughout the education system. Williams was the first Aboriginal compensation test case against the NSW State Government for negligence by the Aboriginal Welfare Board who were responsible for her removal from her mother and the abuse she endured from the Homes she was sent to. She lost her case in the Supreme Court in August 1999. In 2000 Joy went to the New South Wales Court of Appeal; her case was heard by Chief Justice Spigelman, Justice Shellar and Justice Heydon and lost that also. On 22 June 2001 the High Court rejected an application for further leave to appeal.

Rotherham Bridge

Rotherham Bridge crosses the River Don in central Rotherham, South Yorkshire. It is known for its bridge chapel, considered the best preserved in England.
A document of 1385 refers to Bridgegate in the town, which implies that a previous bridge existed on the same site. The road it carries was originally the main route from London and Mansfield to Barnsley, Halifax and Richmond. The current bridge was erected by 1483, when the Chapel of Our Lady of Rotherham Bridge was added. It is of ashlar sandstone and is built on three piers, each with a cutwater.
John Leland, writing around 1540, described a "fair Stone Bridge of iiii arches" and "a Chapel of Stone well wrought". The chapel was dissolved in 1547 and converted into first an almshouse, then the town gaol and finally a shop. The bridge was altered in 1768–69 by John Platt, working for John Carr of York, but was restored to its original dimensions by Reginald Blomfield in 1927, when Chantry Bridge was built alongside. The chapel was restored at the same time.
The bridge is Grade I listed and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge

Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge was established on October 27, 2000 as the 526th refuge in the United States National Wildlife Refuge System. It is located near the town of St. Francisville, Louisiana, which is north of Baton Rouge. The refuge was established to conserve, restore, and manage native forested wetland habitats for migratory birds, aquatic resources, and endangered and threatened plants and animals. Additionally, it was created to encourage the use of volunteers and facilitate partnerships among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, local communities, and conservation organizations to promote public awareness of resources of the refuge and the National Wildlife Refuge System.
Establishment.
In 2000, The Nature Conservancy of Louisiana purchased the land that would become Cat Island NWR. The land was acquired by the Fish and Wildlife Service in stages. In 2003, the refuge size increased to its current size of . The congressionally approved acquisition boundary is .
Natural history.
Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge is along the southernmost portion of the lower Mississippi River, which does not have levees. It floods in most years. The refuge is home to many fish, wildlife and plant resources. The forested wetlands of the refuge are home to the federally listed Louisiana black bear. The Mississippi River is a major bird migration corridor: the refuge is located within an area of high importance for neotropical migratory birds, including the swallow-tailed kite, which is a species of special concern. Other wildlife found in the area include white-tailed deer, bobcat, mink, river otter, wild turkey, black-crowned night-heron, wood duck, blue-winged teal, woodcock, solitary sandpiper, greater yellowlegs, prothonotary warbler, northern parula, pileated woodpecker, green treefrog, and red-eared slider.
Several habitat types including overcup oak-bitter pecan, hackberry-elm-ash, nuttall oak-ash-sweetgum, and shrub-scrub swamp occur on the refuge. The most unique type is old growth baldcypress-tupelo. Many of the baldcypress trees are estimated to be 500 to 1,000 years old. The National Champion baldcypress, which is the largest tree of any species east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, is found in the refuge. The National Champion baldcypress tree is located from the entrance gate of the refuge.
Access.
The refuge is inundated by the river to varying degrees, generally between January and June. The refuge is accessible by vehicle when the Mississippi River gauge reading in Baton Rouge is less than about . A series of gates have been installed along the road, which allow access as the Mississippi River rises and falls. No access to the National Champion baldcypress tree is available once the Mississippi River gauge in Baton Rouge reaches . All vehicular access to the refuge ends at .

Knowledge instinct.
The term knowledge instinct is used by Leonid Perlovsky in his book "Neural Networks and Intellect: Using Model-Based Concepts" and other publications. In his works the knowledge instinct is recognized on a par with other ‘basic instincts’ such as instincts for food and procreation as a fundamental mechanism of human functioning.
The existence of knowledge instinct follows from the cognitive and neural evidence about the brain mechanisms of perception and cognition, as well as mathematical modeling of these mechanisms. The conclusion that that humans and higher animals have a special instinct responsible for cognition is supported by several other researchers. Harry Harlow discovered that monkeys as well as humans have the drive for positive stimulation, regardless of satisfaction of drives such as hunger; Daniel Berlyne discussed curiosity in this regard; Leon Festinger, introduced the notion of cognitive dissonance and described many experiments on the drive of humans to reduce dissonance; John Cacioppo discussed the need for cognition.
The fundamental nature of this mechanism is related to the fact that our knowledge always has to be modified to fit the current situations. One rarely sees exactly the same object: illumination, angles, surrounding objects are usually different; therefore, adaptation-learning is required. A mathematical formulation of the mind mechanisms (Perlovsky 2006) emphasizes the fundamental nature of our desire for knowledge. Virtually all learning and adaptive algorithms (tens of thousands of publications) maximize correspondence between the algorithm internal structure (knowledge in a wide sense) and objects of recognition. Concept-models that our mind uses for understanding the world are in a constant need of adaptation. Knowledge is not just a static state; it is in a constant process of adaptation and learning. Without adaptation of concept-models humans and animals will not be able to understand the ever-changing surrounding world. They will not be able to orient ourselves or satisfy any of the bodily needs. Therefore, animals must have an inborn need, a drive, an instinct to improve knowledge, called the knowledge instinct. Mathematically it is described as a maximization of a similarity measure between the knowledge stored in mind concepts and the world as it is sensed by sensory organs.
Dynamic logic (neural).
In Perlovsky's works, the term Dynamic logic refers to a logic-process describing mathematically a fundamental mind mechanism of interactions between bottom-up signals and top-down signals as a process of adaptaton from vague to crisp concepts. Dynamic logic is a mathematical description of the Knowledge instinct. This mathematical formulation results in practically usable algorithms used within the framework of Neural modeling fields. It resulted in significant improvement in solving classical problems (such as detection, recognition, tracking, fusion) and new approaches to recently emerging problems (such as text search engines and cultural prediction models).
Physics of the mind.
Physics occupies itself with the search for basic laws, a few universal “first principles” describing a wealth of observed phenomena. Perlovsky aims to develop a physical theory of the mind and suggests the first principles that need to be included in such theory. Among “the first principles” of the mind are interactions between bottom-up signals and top-down signals, which is the essence of perception, cognition, and concept formation; mechanisms of instincts and emotions, and their interaction with cognition; the knowledge instinct driving cognition, higher mental abilities, and related aesthetic emotions. Dynamic logic mathematically describes these mechanisms.

Indian Railway Library

The Indian Railway Library was an enterprise conducted in Allahabad from 1888. It was a publishing venture of A.H. Wheeler & Co, who "had the monopoly on bookstall sales on Indian railway stations" 
It was a series of pamphlets intended to catch the interest of railway passengers, and offer cheap 'throwaway' reading material. The series began as a result of an initiative by Rudyard Kipling as he sought to assemble funds to return to England from India in 1888: he approached the senior partner of A.H. Wheeler & Co, Emile Moreau, with the proposal to publish his stories in cheap booklet form. The booklets were to have grey-green cards covers, with illustrations by Rudyard's father John Lockwood Kipling. Six booklets were eventually produced, which sold at the price of one rupee. They were all by Rudyard Kipling, and consisted mainly of reprints of stories that had already appeared in various of the periodicals for which he was already writing in India. They were all published in 1888.

Samurai Girl (miniseries)

Samurai Girl is a six-hour mini-series loosely based on the popular young-adult novel series by Carrie Asai. The event stars Jamie Chung, Brendan Fehr, and Stacy Keibler. The series began its three-day premiere on ABC Family on September 5, 2008.
Premise.
This story follows Heaven, who at six months old was the sole survivor of a deadly plane crash. The press had named her Heaven, because it seemed that she fell from the sky. Soon after, she was adopted by the powerful Kogo Family and lived a very privileged life. But then, 19 years later, things take an unexpected turn, when her wedding is attacked and her brother, Ohiko, is killed trying to save her, not before warning her that the Yakuza have infiltrated her family. So she breaks free from her family and begins training to be a samurai and fight back against the Yakuza.
Plot.
Part 1.
Heaven sneaks maple glazed donuts into the compound and is startled by Hiko. Hiko tells Heaven that he is leaving to go to stay with his friend Jake in San Francisco and gives Heaven a necklace as a birthday present.
One year later, we find that Heaven's about to be wed to Teddy Yukimura. But as the wedding takes place, Yakuza ninjas attack her wedding. Her brother is killed trying to protect her, and her father is shot. Later, she goes to a party where she sees the hostess dumping her boyfriend. The next morning, the hostess Cheryl finds Heaven hiding in her closet. With Cheryl's friend Otto's help, Heaven finds Jake and find that Hiko left her a bag containing a fake passport to a Zen monastery in Indonesia. But, against Hiko's wishes, she returns to the Kogo Towers Hotel. As she is trying to access her fathers files, she is discovered by the maid and takes off running with the laptop and is rescued by Jake.
Later on, Heaven calls Otto to help access the laptop without a password and is able to access surveillance videos to find that her limo driver, Noriyuki, is being beaten up. As they are trying to find the source, the files are deleted but not before discovering that it came from a nightclub. Heaven and Jake head to the nightclub to rescue Noriyuki but are ambushed. After the ambush, they find Noriyuki as he was about to perform Seppuku. When they return to Jake’s loft, Heaven gives Noriyuki a package containing money to escape. Then he tells Heaven about a legend that involves her.
Part 3.
As Heaven is set to return home, Severin warns her that her father is a dangerous man. But she is still convinced that her father is innocent. Then Severin tells her that her father had murdered Teddy's father, Yuji Yukimura. She returns home and discovers that she is a part of an ancient prophecy. With the help of Severin, Cheryl, and Otto, Heaven sneaks into her father's office and steals the documents about the prophecy. After a meeting with Heaven's father, Teddy tells Heaven about the prophecy while he is preparing to leave. 
Part 4.
On the way back from Hiko's funeral, Sato tells Tasuke that her daughter was a spy and were heading to an unknown location when Jake rescues her and takes her back to the hotel to retrieve the sword. To avoid being seen by her father, Heaven and Jake share a long fake kiss. When they finally get back to Jake's loft, they find that Karen, who is Jake's ex-fiancée, has returned to the house. Heaven feels furiously jealous that Jake has a fiancée after they just shared their "first kiss." After Severin reviews the text, he hands it to a former professor to have it translated: He tells her that a secret decoder written on a series of bones sits at the Japanese consulate. So Heaven, Severin, and Cheryl head over to retrieve the bones. 
After retrieving the bones, they discover that a piece of the prophecy is within the Sierra Nevada mountains. So Heaven and Severin set out to get that piece. Jake joins them but they discover that Sato and his men have started on the trail, so they climb up the face of Mount Kyra. While Dr. Fleming (who Cheryl has a crush on) examines the artifacts, Karen sneaks into his office and kills him. Meanwhile, two of the carabiners break free, pulling Jake and Severin down. Severin tells Heaven to cut one of them loose or lose both of them.
Part 5.
Part 5 opens with Severin and Jake yelling at Heaven to cut either of their ropes. Heaven reluctantly cuts Jake's rope sending him falling backward down the mountain. Heaven stays frozen until Severin orders her to climbing so that Jake wouldn't have died in vain. However, Heaven and Severin are not successful in gaining the mirror and return home with nothing. Soon after, Jake, who survived the fall, returns with the mirror and a captured Sato. Otto and Cheryl tell Heaven of Karen's true identity, and Heaven becomes suspicious of her (without evidence) and refuses to confront Jake. After a botched sting operation to uncover Tasuke's money launderer, known only as Sonia, Karen stabs Sato and cuts herself to make it look like he escaped. 
Part 6.
After stabbing Jake, Karen beats up Heaven and kidnaps Cheryl. After seeing Jake at the hospital, she leaves for a location outside Kyoto, Japan. Meanwhile, Severin is interrogating Tasuke, who was arrested in a planned sting, during which he tells the history of the Morishi Protocol which included an underground bidding war. Heaven ends up killing Jake's ex and survives the Morishi Protocol even though her destiny was to die in the end for a person to survive. Heaven, Cheryl, and Severin return to the loft to find that Jake left. Five months later, we find Heaven working as a waitress. Otto brings Heaven a letter from Jake. At the end, on the way home, Heaven comes across Sato and is quickly surrounded by a gang of ninjas and she prepares to fight them.

Fort Lisa (North Dakota)

The first Fort Lisa (1809-1812), also known as the Fort Manuel Lisa Trading Post and as Fort Manuel, was started by the notable fur trader Manuel Lisa of the Missouri Fur Company in 1809. It was located near the Gros Ventres village located between the mouth of the Little Missouri and that of the Big Knife rivers in what is now North Dakota. This fort was likely where Sacagawea died; she had been the guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 
Fort Lisa superseded Fort Raymond, the first outpost built by Lisa in 1806-1807 at the mouth of the Bighorn River in Montana, as the uppermost post of the Missouri Fur Company on the Missouri River. In 1812 Lisa built a replacement fort downriver near present-day North Omaha, Nebraska, which he also named Fort Lisa. 
History.
Although dates vary according to account, at some point in 1806-07 the fur trader Manuel Lisa established Fort Raymond at the mouth of the Bighorn River, where it entered the Yellowstone River. This was the first permanent structure of its kind on the Upper Missouri. It was at first just "two rooms and a loft". Lisa named it after his son, but traders also called it Manuel's Fort or Fort Manuel. Lisa built it for the company which he and William Clark jointly owned; it was called the St. Louis Missouri Fur Company. At the time of its establishment, Fort Raymond/Manuel was the first permanent structure of its kind on the Upper Missouri. Lisa established the only trading post in the Great Plains region. This made the Fort instrumental in American relations with local tribes, as well as the early settlement of the Nebraska Territory.
In 1808 George Drouillard, a member of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery, was tried for the murder of a deserter from Fort Lisa. He had mortally wounded the man while trying to capture him. (Given the date, this source is probably referring to Lisa's first fort, Fort Raymond/Manuel.) 
In 1809 Lisa was one of the founders of the St. Louis Missouri Fur Company, later known as the Missouri Fur Company, which included members of the Chouteau family, founders of St. Louis. On his fur expedition in 1809 with 300 men, Lisa and his company built another fort further east, near the Gros Ventres village located between the mouth of the Little Missouri and that of the Big Knife rivers in what is now North Dakota. This was named Fort Lisa, or, as in the excerpt below, Fort Manuel Lisa Trading Post. He abandoned Fort Raymond/Manuel and shifted operations to the new post. The famous Astor Expedition would have stopped at Fort Lisa in 1811.
Henry Brackenridge, a fur dealer at Fort Manuel Lisa Trading Post on the Missouri River, wrote in his journal in 1811 that Sacagawea, the notable Native American guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was living at Fort Lisa with her husband Charbonneau. He wrote that Sacagawea "...had become sickly and longed to revisit her native country." The following year, John Luttig, a clerk at Fort Manuel Lisa, recorded in his journal on December 20, 1812, that "...the wife of Charbonneau, a Snake Squaw, died of putrid fever." (Note: Often called childbed fever, this was a frequent complication of childbirth.) Luttig noted that she was "aged about 25 years. She left a fine infant girl." 
Charbonneau had already entrusted his and Sacagawea's son Jean Baptiste into Clark's care for a boarding school education. Clark was fond of the boy and offered to support his education. Fort Lisa was abandoned soon after this period.
Because of difficulties with Indians and shipping at this location, in 1812 Lisa built a third fort downriver about 12 miles north of present-day Omaha. He named this Fort Lisa, too, and shifted his operations to this location. This became the main post of the Missouri Fur Company and its successors under various names.

Jade Chung

Jade Chung (born November 6, 1984) is a Canadian professional wrestler, manager and model.
Chung has appeared with professional wrestling promotions such as Border City Wrestling, IWA Mid-South, Ring of Honor and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla. Wrestlers she has managed include Frankie Kazarian, Jimmy Rave, Nate Mattson, Conrad Kennedy III, A-1, Scorpio Sky, Mr. Hughes and Shane Douglas.
Modelling career.
Born in Guelph, Ontario of Chinese Vietnamese decent, Chung started modeling at the age of 12 as a runway model and appeared in cover stories for several fashion magazines while modeling in Vietnam. In 2002, she won the "Cover Girl" title from the Vietnamese fashion magazine "Thoi Moi" in 2002 and appeared on the cover of two other Vietnamese fashion magazines the following year. Chung was also one of 500 models selected to represent ImportFest 2003 in Toronto and was a top ten finalist in the 2004 Miss Viet Canada Pageant. She also starred as an extra in Ashanti's "Rain On Me" music video.
Professional wrestling career.
A wrestling fan as a child, she often watched the World Wrestling Federation well into high school. Chung was encouraged to enter professional wrestling after meeting Beth Phoenix and Traci Brooks at a local wrestling event and spent her summers training at Rob Fuego’s Toronto-based wrestling school "Squared Circle Training". Having some personal friends already in professional wrestling, she later attended local independent shows in hopes of getting hired full-time.
She eventually made her professional debut for wrestler/promoter Scott D'Amore's Border City Wrestling where, in September 2003, she managed ”Franchise” Shane Douglas to win the BCW Can-Am Heavyweight Championship from D-Lo Brown. She would spend the next two years in various independent promotions in Canada and the United States. At A Night of Appreciation for Sabu, she was in the corner of A-1 when he defeated D-Lo Brown to win the BCW Can-Am Heavyweight Championship in Belleville, Michigan on December 12, 2004.
Ring of Honor.
In early 2005, Jade Chung made her debut in Ring of Honor as a valet for manager Prince Nana's stable The Embassy replacing Angel Williams. Although part of one of the top factions in the promotion, Chung was used as a footstool for members of the stable, particularly Jimmy Rave. She was in the corner of Jimmy Rave when he defeated CM Punk in a dog collar match at Manhattan Mayhem on May 31. During the match, she was one of several members of The Embassy to interfere in the match and, at one point, she had entered the ring to apply a sleeper hold on CM Punk.
After Jimmy Rave lost to Roderick Strong on October 1, Jade left The Embassy to become the manager of Generation Next in their feud with The Embassy. The following night, she interfered in a match between Jimmy Rave and Matt Sydal costing him the match. She continued to feud with rival manager Prince Nana and, during a match on October 29, she attacked him with a tilt-a-whirl DDT. On November 5, Ring of Honor announced that Chung had been attacked by an unidentified man in the parking lot. A still photo of Jimmy Rave was shown on November 19 attacking Chung and the promotion claimed that she was no longer involved in wrestling.
The feud was finally concluded at "Steel Cage Warfare" when she made a surprise appearance during the main event, an 8-man Steel Cage Warfare match between The Embassy (Jimmy Rave, Abyss, Alex Shelley and Prince Nana) vs. Generation Next (Roderick Strong, Matt Sydal, Austin Aries and Jack Evans). Chung, who appeared with bandages as a result of her attack by Jimmy Rave, distracted The Embassy long enough for Jack Evans to enter the match and perform a double moonsault off the top off the cage. After Generation Next defeated The Embassy, Chung used Jimmy Rave as her own footstool during the in-ring celebration after the match.
Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.
In March 2006, she appeared as the manager of the "Dark & Lovely" (Human Tornado and Scorpio Sky). She also made an appearance at All Pro Wrestling's "Gym Wars", being in the corner of B-Boy in his defeat against MPT, and for Battle Ground Wrestling with Scott Lost losing a match to Foob Dogg for a lifetime contract with the company. She also managed Joey Ryan in single matches during the same time in PWG.
On October 7, Chung participated in a "First Blood Handicap" match with Scorpio Sky, teaming as the "Scorpio Sky Experience", to defeat Frankie Kazarian. A month later, her stable (Scorpio Sky, Chris Bosh, Scott Lost & Joey Ryan) lost an 8-man tag team match against Candice LeRae's team (Frankie Kazarian, Human Tornado, El Generico and Quicksilver). She eventually turned on Scorpio Sky after he lost a "Loser Leaves PWG" match to Frankie Kazarian on January 27, 2007. At the NWA supercard "Bloodlust! 3", she and Kitana Vera defeated Candice LeRae & Carla Jade in a tag team match in Covina, California on November 9.
She continued to appear with Scott Lost & Joey Ryan and was in their corner at the first supercard for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla as they faced The Age of the Fall (Tyler Black and Jimmy Jacobs) at "PWG All Star Weekend 6, Night 1" in Van Nuys, California on January 5, 2008. On March 21, Chung was injured by Super Dragon during a tag team match between The Dynasty and Kevin Steen and El Generico. She was forced to take a leave of absence and, as a result, Scott Lost and Joey Ryan lost several opportunities to win the PWG Tag Team titles in matches against El Blazer and KAGETORA and Los Luchas (Phoenix Star and Zokre).

Prince Chunk

Prince Chunk (also known as Princess Chunk and Captain Chunk, real name: Powder) (1998 - November 21, 2010) was a domestic shorthair cat, who at one time was alleged to weigh forty-four pounds (some two pounds short of the world record). He was found in Voorhees, New Jersey, on July 26, 2008, by Animal Control, who nicknamed him "Captain Chunk". After a search for his owner, it was found that his name was Powder and that he was abandoned by Donna Oklatner, an elderly Voorhees resident. Oklatner claimed she couldn't afford to take care of the cat when she lost her home in foreclosure proceedings.
He was later adopted from the Camden County Animal Shelter in New Jersey by Donna Damiani, and in August 2008 his weight was already down to 22 pounds.
According to the "Guinness World Records", the largest tabby cat was forty-six pounds and fifteen ounces. Since then, the publishers have dropped the category to prevent possible harm to cats.
He made television appearances on "Live with Regis and Kelly", "Good Morning America", Fox News, and MSNBC, based on his reported weight, but reliable sources of the cat's definitive weight in July 2008 are not available. One paper reported that "shelter officials said they were perplexed by the discrepancy", after the Damiani family found that the cat weighed just over 22 pounds, "days after" receiving him.
Prince Chunk died on November 21, 2010, due to heart disease.

Right to Die (Masters of Horror)

Right to Die is the ninth episode of the second season from "Masters of Horror" directed by Rob Schmidt.
Plot.
Cliff Addison (Martin Donovan) and his wife, Abby (Julia Benson), have a road accident. He walks away unharmed, but she is left in a coma with her skin burned off. Cliff is told that there is a method of surgery that will allow her to live, but without speech or the ability to take care of herself. Cliff consults with an attorney, who persuades him to let his wife die. He reveals to his wife that he had an affair.
Cliff remembers an instance where his wife found his cell phone with a video of his mistress, Trish (Robin Sydney), stripping whilst moaning his name. Shortly after, Cliff hallucinates that he is taking a bath with his wife and they make love while her skin burns off. While he panics, it is shown that his wife had died but was resuscitated, and that he has a hand-shaped burn mark on his back. Cliff runs into Trish, and it's revealed that she had been fired by Abby, and only slept with Cliff out of pity. Cliff visits Abby and attempts to kiss her. Her eyes open and she begins to flatline. Cliff then learns that she had flatlined two nights ago, but was brought back.
Abby's ghost brutally kills Cliff's attorney. Cliff returns home to see a drunken Trish and they have sex. In bed, Cliff tells Trish that in four hours, without the skin transplant, Abby will die, as will he. Cliff's phone rings, showing he is receiving seductive pictures of Trish, but sees Abby's skinless figure approaching from behind her. Trish screams, making Cliff rush to her, and comforts her. He then breaks a bottle over her head. We next see a naked Trish strapped in the dentist chair, being prepped by Cliff to have her skin transferred to Abby. He informs her that he regrets that she has to be alive for the procedure, but the skin has to be fresh. In her heavily-drugged state, she feels no pain. 
Cliff thinks back to the drive before the accident. Abby revealed that she was pregnant. Cliff was apparently overjoyed, but Abby said that she was going to leave him because of the affair and never let him see the baby. Because of their argument, Cliff had taken his eyes off the road, which led to their crash. The beginning scene is replayed, but it is shown that Cliff made a conscious decision to not call 911. She apologized for being harsh to him, but he purposely set the car on fire. Almost immediately, he regretted his decision as she screamed in agony.
Back to the present, Cliff arrives at the hospital with the skin, but finds that Abby has already died. He throws away Trish's body pieces, then goes home to be greeted by Abby's spirit.

<doc id="18752521" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18752521" title="Sarah Conlon">
Sarah Conlon

Sarah Conlon (née Maguire) (20 January 1926 – 19 July 2008) was an Irish housewife and a prominent campaigner in one of the most high-profile miscarriage of justice cases in British legal history. She spent decades campaigning to have the names of her husband Giuseppe and son Gerry cleared over the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) pub bombings at Guildford and Woolwich, and helped secure an apology from former British prime minister Tony Blair in 2005 for their wrongful imprisonment.
Guildford pub bombings.
The Guildford pub bombings occurred in 1974, when an IRA unit planted bombs in two pubs in Guildford, Surrey, and the resulting explosions killed four soldiers and one civilian, and injured 50 others. The investigation into the bombings led to the arrest and conviction of Gerard Conlon, Patrick Armstrong, Paul Hill and Carole Richardson, an Englishwoman; dubbed as "the Guildford Four". The four were jailed for life in 1975 for the bombings, and each served 15 years in jail before their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal. This was due to an extensive inquiry carried out by Avon and Somerset Police into the original police investigation. The inquiry found that the way the confessions of the four were noted were seriously flawed, concluding that the notes taken were not written up immediately and that officers may have colluded in the wording of the statements.
Giuseppe Conlon, Sarah's husband, was convicted in 1976 along with six members of the Maguire family (the seven being dubbed the Maguire Seven) of running an IRA bomb factory in North London, on the basis of forensic evidence. Each was sentenced to up to 14 years in jail, served their sentences, and with the exception of Giuseppe Conlon who died in 1980, were released. The Maguire Seven's first appeal, in 1977, was turned down, but a later appeal, prompted by the release of the Guildford Four, found that test kits used to detect traces of explosives had been contaminated. In 1991, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions after it was ruled the original evidence against them was unsafe. On 9 February 2005, then Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a public apology to the Maguire Seven and the Guildford Four for the miscarriages of justice they had suffered, saying that he was "very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and such an injustice", and that "they deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated."
Role in the sentences and appeals.
Sarah Conlon won huge admiration in Ireland for her quiet dignity and refusal to feel bitterness. During the years that her husband and son were in jail, she sent weekly parcels of cigarettes, sweets, and Irish newspaper clippings to them, and saved up her prison visits for the two weeks of her annual holiday. Her regular letters to them always ended the same way: ""Pray for them ones who told lies against you... It's them who needs help as well as yourself.""
Father McKinley, a priest who noticed Sarah crying after the 1977 appeal was turned down, and others helped her begin a campaign to free her husband, son and other members of the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven. She took to lobbying dignitaries, church leaders and the media, in addition to writing to numerous Irish politicians, including the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) members of parliament Joe Hendron and John Hume, to ask for their support. At one stage she travelled to London to meet Cardinal Basil Hume to ask for his assistance. Her campaigning led to the start of the aforementioned inquiry, announced in 1989 by the home secretary Douglas Hurd, into the Guildford bomb cases, which led to Gerry's release. News of her husband's death reached Sarah just after she received a message from home secretary Willie Whitelaw stating that her husband was about to be released on compassionate grounds. 
Twenty-five years after her husband's death, Sarah Conlon and her family decided to fight for a public apology for the miscarriage of justice on her family. Once again she led the campaign, lobbying church leaders and politicians, among them the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who pledged his support, which culminated in Tony Blair's apology to the Conlon family. Ill, she was unable to make the trip to London to hear the apology, but her children spoke to her by telephone from the House of Commons. After securing the apology, she mentioned that she no longer had to worry about dying and what it means.
SDLP leader and Foyle member of parliament Mark Durkan described Sarah as "a true heroine of our age" and "shining example to us all", saying that she had the "patience of a saint" and "huge reserves of faith, fortitude and remarkable forgiveness", and that "her story is an inspiration of faith, hope and love".
Personal life.
She was described as a woman of "immense Catholic faith" who was protective of her son Gerry, and who held the family together with her hard work, wanting their life to be respectable, holy, and quiet. She spent years working at a scrapyard sorting old clothes, and later worked long hours for low pay in the kitchens of the Royal Victoria Hospital, serving food to patients and mopping the floors. Her husband, Giuseppe, was a pacifist who evaded the draft during World War II. He once worked at Harland & Wolf painting the hulls of ships, where the lead in the paint damaged his lungs. His condition was worsened by the humidity and condensation in the house, and he subsequently developed tuberculosis and emphysema.
Sarah Conlon died of lung cancer in July 2008, aged 82.
In popular culture.
The Hollywood movie "In The Name of the Father", starring Daniel Day-Lewis and directed by Jim Sheridan, is based on the Conlon family's story. Northern Irish actress Marie Jones played Sarah Conlon. The movie was adapted from Gerry Conlon’s autobiography "Proved Innocent", later published as "In the Name of the Father".
The 1990 made-for-television film "Dear Sarah" is based on the letters Giuseppe Conlon wrote to his wife while in prison. The film was produced by Raidió Teilifís Éireann, directed by Frank Cvitanovich and written by Tom McGurk. It featured Stella McCusker as Sarah Conlon.

List of authors and works on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum

This is a selected list of authors and works listed on the "Index Librorum Prohibitorum". The "Index" was abolished on June 14, 1966 by Pope Paul VI.
A complete list of the authors and writings present in the subsequent editions of the index are listed in J. Martinez de Bujanda, Index Librorum Prohibitorum", 1600-1966", Geneva, 2002.
Some notable authors and intellectuals whose works are widely read today in leading universities worldwide and are now considered as the foundations of science were listed on the Index. E.g. Kepler's "New Astronomy" and "World Harmony" were quickly placed on the Index after their publication. Other examples of noteworthy intellectuals and religious figures who were on the Index include Martin Luther, Jean-Paul Sartre, Voltaire, John Calvin, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, René Descartes, Francis Bacon, Huldrych Zwingli and Blaise Pascal.
Single works listed.
With some writers, only certain books were banned: Samuel Richardson "(Pamela)," Emanuel Swedenborg "(The Principia)," or Immanuel Kant "(Critique of Pure Reason)," for example. Alfred Rosenberg's "Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts" (The Myth of the Twentieth Century) and his "An die Dunkelmänner unserer Zeit: eine Antwort auf die Angriffe gegen den "Mythus des 20. Jahrhundert"" (Regarding The Dark Men of Our Time: an Answer to the Problems against the "Myth of the Twentieth Century"), were condemned by decrees of February 7, 1934 and of July 17, 1935 respectively. Ernst Bergmann's "Die deutsche Nationalkirche" (The German National Church) and his "Die natürliche Geistlehre" (Natural Spirit Teachings), by decrees of February 7, 1934 and November 17, 1937.
Authors' complete works listed.
In a few cases, according to "The Book of Lists" by Irving Wallace, Amy Wallace and David Wallechinsky, "all" works of a particular writer were on the Index: Thomas Hobbes, Émile Zola, Jean-Paul Sartre. As for Benedict Spinoza, the Church put all of his posthumous works on the Index.
Most of these were inserted in the Index at a time when the Index itself stated that the prohibition of someone's "opera omnia" (all his works) did not cover works whose contents did not concern religion and were not forbidden by the general rules of the Index, but this explanation was omitted in the 1929 edition, an omission that was officially interpreted in 1940 as meaning that thenceforth "opera omnia" covered all the author's works without exception.
Other.
Among the notable writers on the list were Simone de Beauvoir, Jean Buridan and Laurence Sterne, as well as the Dutch sexologist Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde, author of the sex manual "The Perfect Marriage".
Reversals and non-inclusions.
There have been cases of reversal with respect to works that were on the Index, such as those of Nicolaus Copernicus and Galileo Galilei: "The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned "Dialogue") in Florence. In 1741 Pope Benedict XIV authorized the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works which included a mildly censored version of the "Dialogue". In 1758 the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the "Dialogue" and Copernicus's "De Revolutionibus" remained. All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index." 
Not on the Index were Aristophanes, Juvenal, John Cleland, James Joyce and D. H. Lawrence. According to Wallace et al., this was because the primary criterion for banning the work was anticlericalism, blasphemy and heresy.
Some authors whose views are generally unacceptable to the Church (e.g. Karl Marx) were never put on the "Index"; nor was Charles Darwin (see Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church).

Fulbright Tower

The Fulbright Tower is a 52 story skyscraper originally known as 3 Houston Center. A part of the downtown Houston Center complex, the tower has of Class A office space. The bottom seven levels were designed for four trading floors for commodities like electricity and natural gas. The building at one point was owned by ChevronTexaco. As of 2005, Crescent owns the tower in a joint venture with the affiliates of GE Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Fulbright & Jaworski has its headquarters in the Fulbright Tower, in Suite 5100.
History.
Construction on the tower was scheduled to begin in November 1980. The building was built in 1982. The tower property was developed in 1985. Fulbright & Jaworski became a tenant during that year. The original name of the structure was the Gulf Tower. Chevron became the building's main tenant, and its name became the Chevron Tower. Fulbright & Jaworski renegotiated and extended its lease in 2003 and retained the possibility of naming rights; as of 2005, the firm occupies of space. On February 24, 2005, Crescent completed the joint venture agreement involving the Fulbright Tower; a pension fund investor advised by JPMorgan Asset Management bought a 60% ownership interest in the building and an affiliate of GE Asset Management bought a 16.15% ownership interest. In 2004, ChevronTexaco sold the building to Crescent. During that year the tower was 49% occupied. By March 2005, ChevronTexaco planned to move its operations out of the tower after buying 1500 Louisiana Street in Downtown Houston. Fulbright & Jaworski used their naming rights, and in 2005 the building gained the name "Fulbright Tower". In 2005, the Fulbright Tower was 57% occupied. In 2006, Chevron Corporation still occupied three floors at the Fulbright Tower. In 2009 Conway MacKenzie leased at the Fulbright Tower.

Western Australian state election, 2008

A general election was held in the state of Western Australia on Saturday 6 September 2008 to elect 59 members to the Legislative Assembly and 36 members to the Legislative Council. The incumbent centre-left Australian Labor Party government, in power since the 2001 election and led since 25 January 2006 by Premier Alan Carpenter, was defeated by the centre-right Liberal Party opposition, led by Opposition Leader Colin Barnett since 6 August 2008.
The election resulted in a hung parliament with no party gaining a majority. Labor was two seats short of a majority in the expanded legislature. Ultimately, the Liberals were able to form a coalition government with the WA Nationals, supported by three independents. While both parties agreed to National demands that at least 25 percent of mining proceeds go to regional projects, the Nationals ultimately went with the Liberals. According to Nationals leader Brendon Grylls, a Labor-National coalition would have required the support of Green support to get mining legislation passed in the Legislative Council. The coalition agreement gave National Party ministers "the right to exempt from Cabinet and vote against an issue on the floor of the Parliament if it's against the wishes of the people [they represent," an explicit rejection of the pattern of former non-Labor coalition agreements under which the Nationals had been seen as virtual co-owners of Liberal policies.
The election was the first to be held since a major electoral redistribution was implemented in 2007. This redistribution involved significant changes to the geographic distribution of parliamentary seats and regions in Western Australia, and brought the state into line with the rest of Australia in adopting one vote one value for the lower house.
The election was called earlier than expected by Alan Carpenter, who requested the Governor to dissolve parliament on 7 August 2008.
Background.
Electoral changes.
The 2008 election takes place with entirely new boundaries determined in a redistribution finalised on 29 October 2007 by the Western Australian Electoral Commission. Prior to the redistribution, the "Electoral Act 1907", which governs elections in the state, specified that the metropolitan region which includes Perth and its suburbs, was to be divided into 34 Assembly districts or 60% of the seats, while the rest of the state was to be divided into 23 or 40% of the seats. However, at the 2006 census, taken on 8 August 2006, 73.76% of Western Australians lived in the metropolitan region.* </ref> This meant that each member of the Legislative Assembly, as at 30 September 2007, was representing either 28,519 metropolitan voters or 14,551 country voters.
One vote one value had long been sought by the Australian Labor Party, that party claiming to be disadvantaged by the familiar reality that country constituencies have tended to elect non-Labor members. The Burke Labor government (1983–1988), with the conditional support of the National Party, managed to achieve limited reform—through the "Acts Amendment (Electoral Reform) Act 1987"—in increasing the metropolitan quota from 29 to 34, redesigning the Legislative Council (or Upper House) into a Senate-style body with six uneven multi-member seats filled by a system of STV proportional representation, and creating a permanent, funded Electoral Commission as a body fully independent from Parliament and the executive. Between Burke's retirement from politics in 1988 and Labor's election loss five years later, the government faced a hostile upper house, considerable distractions by way of the WA Inc royal commission and, after 1991, was a minority government unable to achieve further electoral reform.
Following Labor's win at the 2001 election, the new premier Geoff Gallop and attorney-general Jim McGinty were committed to implementing 'one vote, one value'. By this time, all other states and territories had eliminated electoral malapportionment. Unlike their predecessors, they could count on the support of half of the upper-house members for passage of the electoral legislation but, as the proposed legislation involved constitutional change, an absolute majority of the members was necessary. The Government went to the High Court in 2003 to determine whether the Legislative Council president's casting vote could be used to obtain the majority, but the High Court answered that it could not. Change occurred, however, when the Liberal Party, which staunchly opposed the reform, failed to preselect one of their North Metropolitan MLCs, Alan Cadby, in a bid to get Peter Collier into the Legislative Council at the 2005 election. Cadby resigned from the Liberal Party and completed his term as an Independent, consenting to Labor's electoral legislation with some amendments. On 20 May 2005, just before newly elected upper-house members were to take their places, the "Electoral Amendment and Repeal Act 2005 (No.1 of 2005)" passed.
The passage of the "Electoral Reform (Electoral Funding) Act 2006" into law on 26 October 2006 means that, for the first time, candidates, parties and Legislative Council groups will be able to receive public funding based on their performance in terms of votes at the election as well as a refund of their nomination deposit if they receive over 4% of the primary vote, as is the case in several other states and in federal elections. The rate for the 2008 election has been set at $1.56888 per vote. The legislation, which was Attorney-General Jim McGinty's second attempt to introduce the measure, was explicitly based on the 1992 reforms of Queensland's Electoral Act and was intended to improve accountability and increase candidates' immunity, or perceived immunity, from outside influences. Prior to the 2008 election, candidates could receive a refund of their nomination deposit only if they achieved 10% of the total primary vote. Earlier similar legislation had failed in November 2003, despite an in-principle agreement with then opposition leader Colin Barnett, owing to Liberal backbench opposition and a campaign against the proposal by the "West Australian" newspaper, which termed the measure as a 'poll tax'.
The electoral system.
The Western Australian Legislative Assembly has a total of 59 seats, up from 57 in the last parliament. The last increase in seats, from 55 to 57, occurred before the 1983 election. Since the enactment of the "Electoral Act 1907", each seat is filled by a single member selected using instant-runoff preferential voting. In order for a valid vote to be cast, voters must number all candidates on the ballot paper in the order of their preference as with Australian House of Representatives elections. At the election, 42 of the seats are located in the metropolitan area, 12 in the Agricultural and South West regions, and 5 in the Mining and Pastoral region in the north and east of the state. Seats in the Mining and Pastoral region are permitted to be under quota on account of their significant geographical size, but all other seats have a quota of 21,350 voters with a maximum variance of 10%.
The Western Australian Legislative Council, sometimes referred to as the 'upper house', consists of 36 members, with 6 elected from each of 6 multi-member regions (also known as constituencies). The system used for voting is known as Single transferable vote, which is a variant of the proportional representation system. The ballot paper (voting form), traditionally printed on pink coloured paper, is divided into two sections. The voter casts a vote in either one of two ways – by writing the numeral "1" on the left hand side corresponding to the party of choice, or by numbering all candidates on the right hand side of the form according to his/her preference. If the voter chooses the first method, the vote is then counted according to the publicly known preference listing for the party chosen by the voter. The same voting system is used for electing members to the Australian Senate.
Members of the Legislative Council, unlike those in the Legislative Assembly, hold their seats for a fixed term of four years. They take their seats in the house on 22 May following the date of their election. The Legislative Council is not dissolved prior to the end of each four year term, even if a general election is held several months prior to the end of the term. For this reason, members elected to the Legislative Council in the 2008 election did not take their seats until May 2009.
Counting the votes.
More than 100,000 electors (7.5% of the electorate) cast their votes prior to election day, either by post or in person. Checking the eligibility of these votes commences 3 days prior to election day at the Count Centre in Fremantle. After the close of polls at 6:00 pm, ballot boxes are emptied and a provisional count of ordinary votes is conducted at each of the 800 polling places. Preliminary results are telephoned to District and Regional Returning Officers, who forward aggregated results to the Tally Room at ABC's East Perth studios.
Election night results are provisional for several reasons. Firstly, there is insufficient time to conduct a full distribution of voter preferences in those Legislative Assembly seats that require it. The official count for all Assembly districts does not commence till after the closing date for postal votes which is the Thursday following the election. Secondly, only ticket votes and first-preference votes for candidates on non-ticket ballots for the Legislative Council are counted on election night, providing only a notional distribution for each region. The high proportion of early votes cast in this election along with the large number of absentee votes cast on election day (caused by elector confusion arising from the recent changes to electoral boundaries) was expected to delay the determination of final results, particularly in closely fought seats. 
Legislative Council ballot papers and all declaration (absentee and provisional) votes cast on election day are delivered to the Count Centre on Sunday where the official count of these votes continues for 7–10 days. Ticket votes are sorted (ticket/non-ticket/informal) then manually counted, while preferences on non-ticket ballots are entered into a computer database under the scrutiny of party officials. The ticket vote results are added to the full preference results and the final result determined. Finally, all Legislative Assembly votes are officially counted by each District Returning Officer who then declares (announces) the successful candidate for the particular district.
Polling.
Newspoll polling was conducted via random telephone number selection in city and country areas. Sampling sizes normally consist of around 800–900 electors, with the 10 – 14 August poll consisting of 1088 electors, and the 2 – 4 September poll consisting of 1802 electors. The margin of error was around ±3.5 percent, while the 2 – 4 September poll had a declared margin of error of ±2.3 percent.

Princess Pauline of Orange-Nassau

Princess Pauline of Orange-Nassau ("Wilhelmina Frederika Louise Pauline Charlotte"; 1 March 1800 - 20 December/22 December 1806) was a Princess of the House of Orange-Nassau.
Life.
Pauline was born in Berlin while her parents were living in exile during the time the Low Countries were occupied by France. She was the third child and first-born daughter of the later King William I of the Netherlands by his wife Wilhelmine of Prussia. Her two older brothers were the future King William II and Prince Frederick of the Netherlands. Her parents also had a stillborn child in 1795. Her younger sister, Marianne, was born four years after her death.
In 1803 Pauline and her family moved to the Nassau family possessions in Germany. Here, she met her paternal grandparents for the first time. They quickly became fond with her, and Pauline's grandfather William V nicknamed her "Polly". Particularly, her grandfather was very happy to see her, because any of the recent Nassau-Orange rulers couldn't see a granddaughter in their lifetimes. In occasion of a ball made to celebrate the birthday of her father, the old obese ex-Prince danced with little Pauline in the grand ballroom of the castle. Since 1804 the family lived with William V in Berlin, where he had bought a palace on the Unter den Linden (No. 36). The palace is known as the "Niederländische Palais".
At the age of five, she and her older brothers began to spend more time with their grandparents in Oranienstein. Since her birth, Pauline had poor health, probably due to the difficult circumstances at the time of her mother's pregnancy. According to doctors, she suffered from some kind of nervous fever.
In August 1806, her parents had another stillborn son. In October, Pauline with her mother and brothers, escape from the French troops from Berlin to Königsberg. Due to the bad weather, the health status of Paulina worsened very quickly. Her mother could then hardly separated from her deathbed and feared for her sanity. According to some sources she died in the home of a mayor who them temporarily housed, but according to anothers, she died in on the final Freienwalde, one of the royal Prussian possessions in west of Berlin, near the Oder. The estate was recently occupied by Princess Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, her maternal grandmother. Berlin was occupied by the French on 27 October and Küstrin on 1 November. The Prussian army under the command of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher finally capitulated on 7 November. Her father, who became a war prisoner after the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October, was released in this occasion.
On 15 December 1806 Pauline's condition became alarming and she died a week later, on 22 December. She was buried in the Freienwalde estate. A monument was only realized in 1813 by sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow. The neglected grave of Pauline was rediscovered by the new owner of Freienwalde, Walther Rathenau in 1909. He discovered on the estate a weathered gravestone. On the monument was Pauline's name. The news was immediately reported to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who had exhume the remains. Without much pomp, in March 1911 Pauline's remains were brought to the Netherlands by the Dutch ambassador in Berlin, Baron Gevers and the Chamberlain van den Bosch. The bronze casket was during the trip in the luggage. Finally, on 7 April 1911 Pauline's remains were interred in the Royal Crypt in the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft. The text of her gravestone reads: ""Grabmal of Friderike Louise Pauline Charlotte Wilhelmine Prinzessin von Nassau und Oranien - Born zu Berlin den 1 Maerz 1800 - dies zu Freienwalde 22d Dezember 1806"".

Mater Health Services North Queensland

Mater Health Services North Queensland operates two private hospitals, one established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1945 named Mater Hospital Pimlico (Formally the Mater Misericordiae Hospital Townsville) and the second purchased in 2007 named the Mater Women's and Children's Hospital Hyde Park (formerly the Wesley/Park Haven Hospital Hyde Park).
History.
Five Sisters of Mercy, members of the Brisbane Congregation, arrived in Townsville in 1878. They began their ministry from a 'cottage on the shores of Cleveland Bay'.
In 1882, Rockhampton was declared a Diocese and the Townsville group was governed from there until 1901, when the group became self-governing with the formation of a Townsville Congregation. Thirteen Sisters were foundation members made up of Sisters from the Brisbane and Rockhampton Congregations who chose to stay in the North.
Over the years the number of Sisters grew and their ministries diversified. Care of sick people was a well established tradition among Sisters of Mercy, and in keeping with that, the decision was made in 1945 to establish a Catholic hospital in Townsville.
A small private hospital in Stagpole Street, known as 'The Lister', was purchased and the Townsville Sisters of Mercy moved formally into Health Care ministry. The hospital was renamed the 'Mater Misericordiae' (Mother of Mercy), the title given to all hospitals operated by the Sisters of Mercy.
When this hospital was found to be inadequate to meet the demands of modern health care, a property was purchased in Fulham Road and a new 50-bed hospital was opened in 1962. The transfer to the new hospital was made possible by the support given to the Sisters of Mercy by local fund raisers.
Hospitals.
Mater Hospital Pimlico is an acute Medical/Surgical facility with a bed capacity of 158. Specialties represented include Cardiac Surgery, Cardiac Catheter Laboratories, Coronary Care Unit, Intensive Care Unit, Endoscopy, Interventional Radiology, Orthopaedics, Neurosurgery, Respiratory Laboratory, Urodynamics, and Sleep Studies Unit. The Mater Outreach Services is composed of the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Unit (PTSD) and the Cardiac Rehabilitation Services.
Mater Women's and Children's Hospital in Hyde Park was established in 2007 and is a Medical/Surgical facility with a present bed capacity of 70. Current specialty areas include Women's, Children's, Obstetrics, General Surgery, Urology, Day Oncology, Urodynamics and Plastics.
Accreditation.
Mater Health Services North Queensland utilises the programme developed by The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards' (ACHS), and Evaluation and Quality Improvement Programme (EQuIP) as a framework to implement and evaluate quality improvement systems through accreditation surveys.

Bueno was ejected, along with bench coach Chino Cadahia. A day later, Bueno was given a fine and three-day suspension by Major League Baseball. Bueno will appeal the fine and suspension, and will only have to serve his final sentence once he returns to the Major Leagues. The situation escalated in the final game of the Braves-Cubs series, when Ted Lilly hit Escobar, prompting a shouting match between the two, and the benches and bullpens to clear, but no fight took place, nor ejections made.
On August 5, , Bueno was signed to a deal lasting until the end of the season with Hanwha Eagles of South Korea. 
In , Bueno joined the Mexican team Sultanes de Monterrey. He signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals in 2012 and was assigned to the Omaha Storm Chasers before called up on June 23. He was sent back to the Omaha Storm Chasers on June 27.

USS Onondaga (1917)

The second USS "Onondaga" was a Coast Guard cutter that served in the United States Navy in 1917 and 1918 during World War I.
The United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter USRC "Onondaga" was built at Cleveland, Ohio in 1898. Upon the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Lifesaving Service to create the United States Coast Guard in 1915, "Onondaga" became a United States Coast Guard Cutter. Until 1917 she was listed as an independent vessel operating out of Savannah, Georgia. Her assigned cruising district extended from Cape Romain, South Carolina, to Cape Canaveral, Florida.
Transferred to the United States Navy on 9 April 1917 by Executive Order for World War I service, she continued to perform patrol, escort, and rescue operations out of Savannah.
The highlight of her naval service occurred on 20 February 1918, when she rescued the entire crew of the British steamship after she foundered on Diamond Shoals off the North Carolina coast. For acting in the best tradition of the seagoing services, Captain Frederick C. Billard, USCG, commanding officer of the cutter—together with the entire crew—received a commendation on 20 May from the British Admiralty.
At the end of hostilities, "Onondaga" was returned to the United States Department of the Treasury to resume her Coast Guard service. She resumed patrol and rescue operations out of New London, Connecticut, until 1920, at which time she transferred to Baltimore, Maryland. She continued to operate out of Baltimore until 1923, when she decommissioned and was sold for scrap.

The 2004 New Orleans Saints season was the team's 38th as a member of the National Football League (NFL). They matched their previous season's output of 8–8, and the team finished the season on a four-game winning streak, which was all the more remarkable because the Saints trailed at some point during every game. The 1978 Atlanta Falcons and the 2002 Cleveland Browns come closest to this record, winning eight games out of fifteen where they trailed at some point.

Hammond Clock Company

The Hammond Clock Company of Chicago, Illinois, produced electric clocks between 1928 and 1941. It was one of the ventures of Laurens Hammond, the inventor of the famous Hammond organ.
The company.
In 1932, the economic troubles of the Great Depression threatened the clock-making industry; about 150 clock companies went out of business. To make matters worse, Hammond's licensees discovered that Hammond's patent on his motor was invalid, due to an earlier German invention of the same technology. In this situation, Hammond attempted to save his factory by starting the production of an electric bridge table. This proved to be nothing but a fleeting success. Hammond did finally manage to save his company with his invention of the Hammond organ, and from 1937 his company was called The Hammond Instrument Company to reflect the new emphasis. The production of clocks was discontinued entirely in 1941.
Further reading.
There is less literature on the Hammond clocks than on the Telechrons. Apart from some websites, such as the ones referred to in the notes, one may consult "Spin to Start", the newsletter of the Synchronous Society, which was devoted to the collection of Hammond clocks. Only two issues have appeared, however: vol. 1, no. 1 (October 1996) and vol. 1, no. 2 (February 1998).

<doc id="18753013" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18753013" title="Henry Gray (musician)">
Henry Gray (musician)

Henry Gray (born January 19, 1925, Kenner, Louisiana) is an African-American blues piano player and singer. He has been playing for more than seven decades, and has played with a multitude of artists including Robert Lockwood, Jr., Billy Boy Arnold, Morris Pejoe, the Rolling Stones, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf among many others. He has more than 58 albums to his credit, including recordings for the Chess Records label. He is credited as helping to create the distinctive sound of the Chicago blues piano.
Early life and education.
Shortly after he was born Gray, an only child, moved with his parents to a farm in Alsen, Louisiana, a few miles north of Baton Rouge, where he would spend his childhood years. Gray began studying piano at the age of eight with a neighborhood woman, Mrs. White. Gray also credits the radio and music records in his home for inspiring his love for music at a young age. A few years later, Gray began playing piano and organ at his local Baptist church, and his family eventually got a piano for the house. While blues playing was not encouraged within his family's home, Henry did play blues at Mrs. White's house, and by the time he was 16 he was playing blues music at a club in Alsen. His father initially disapproved of Gray's "club gig" but, after seeing how much money he was making, Gray's father became supportive. In 1943, Gray joined the United States Army and was sent to the South Pacific during World War II. While in the Army, Gray would frequently entertain his fellow soldiers with his piano playing and singing. Shortly before the war was over, Gray was given a medical discharge from the army. He returned to the U.S. in 1946 where he spent a brief time in Alsen before relocating to Chicago where he had relatives.
Career.
Chicago: 1946-1968.
After arriving in Chicago, Gray began spending a great deal of his time in the growing postwar jazz and blues club scene. He would spend hours listening to and trying to learn from the Windy City's best piano players and would occasionally get hired for smaller gigs. One day while he was sitting in at a club, he caught the attention of Big Maceo Merriweather, an important jazz and blues piano player in Chicago (from Detroit). Merriweather befriended Gray and had an important impact on influencing Gray's "two-fisted playing" and introducing him to several notable bands and club owners. As a result, Grey was able to obtain steady gigs with groups like Little Hudson's Red Devil Trio (Hudson Showers) and guitarist Morris Pejoe before moving into extensive work as a session musician in the recording studio behind Jimmy Reed, Bo Diddley, Billy Boy Arnold, Pejoe, and others. His first recording session was in 1952 with Jimmy Rogers. Gray also worked occasionally with Little Walter, who nicknamed the young pianist "Bird Breast."
In 1956, Gray joined Howlin' Wolf's band and was Wolf's main piano player for twelve years in performance and on recordings. Also during this time, Gray became a session player for numerous artists on recordings made by Chess Records. He recorded with many icons of the blues including: Abb Lock, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Homesick James, Robert Lockwood, Jr., Billy Boy Arnold, Muddy Waters, Johnny Shines, Hubert Sumlin, Lazy Lester, Little Walter Jacobs, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, James Cotton, Little Milton Campbell, Jimmy Rogers, Jimmy Reed, and Koko Taylor among others. Gray also made some recordings on other labels including several recording with J. D. "Jay" Miller's Louisiana Excello blues band during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1963, Gray played with Elmore James on the night that James died of a heart attack.
Louisiana: 1968-today.
Gray left Wolf's band and Chicago in 1968 to return to Alsen, Louisiana due to the death of his father and to assist his mother with the family fish market business. Gray became an important part of Louisiana's music scene where his big, rollicking sound became part of the region's "swamp blues" style. In addition to performing, Gray worked with the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board as a roofer from 1968-1983.
During the last thirty years, Gray has performed at virtually all New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festivals, three Chicago Blues Festivals (1987, 1989, and 2005), the Montreal Jazz Festival (1988), nearly every Baton Rouge Blues Festival since its inception, the San Francisco Blues Festival, Memphis's W.C. Handy Blues Festival, several times at Festival International (Lafayette, Louisiana), the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival (Davenport, Iowa), the King Biscuit Blues Festival (Helena, Arkansas), and many other festivals around the United States. 
Gray has also traveled to Europe frequently to play in festivals and concerts and can be heard on several European releases. In 1988, Blind Pig Records released Gray's first stateside feature LP entitled "Lucky Man". The album was produced by guitarist Steve Freund who also joined Gray on the album for a combination of both Windy City blues and bayou boogie. In 1990, he recorded "Louisiana Swamp Blues" on the Wolf Records label. In 1998, Gray received a Grammy Award nomination for his album "A Tribute to Howlin' Wolf" released on Telarc Records. That same year he played for Mick Jagger's 55th birthday celebration in Paris. In the summer of 1999, Gray toured Europe with Marva Wright and her band giving concerts of "Louisiana music" under the sponsorship of Blue House Records. In 2001, Gray recorded two albums: "Watch Yourself" on the Lucky Cat label and "Henry Gray Plays Chicago Blues" for Hightone Records. During 2003, Henry Gray & the Cats released a CD and DVD entitled "Henry Gray & the Cats: Live in Paris". Additionally in 2003, Gray was featured along with Ray Charles, Dr. John, Pinetop Perkins and Dave Brubeck in Clint Eastwood's "Blues Piano" which was part of Martin Scorsese's seven part series, "The Blues", which was aired nationally on public television. Gray was awarded the 2006 National Heritage Fellowship Award by the National Endowment for the Arts which is the nation's top honor for folk artist. In the same year, Gray was featured along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Pinetop Perkins, Marcia Ball and Little Red in a concert at Morgan Freeman's club Ground Zero in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which became the DVD "Falsifyin"' produced and released by SunLion Films. That same year, Gray starred in the independent film "The Glass Chord" as Saul Solomon, an aging musician suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
Gray continues to tour as a soloist and with his band Henry Gray and the Cats.
Personal life.
At one point in his life Gray suffered from alcoholism but has now obtained sobriety for many years. In 1989, his home in the Baton Rouge area was destroyed by a tornado. Gray is married to Rivers Gray and they have three children and eight grandchildren together.

Lost Coaster of Superstition Mountain

The ride enters an enclosed 'mountain' area several times throughout the ride. The imitation mountain was originally used for a previous dark ride. This dark ride went through the mountain and lights would illuminate scenes of various animals in the mountain.
The Lost Coaster is a moderate ride and does not have big drops. Part of the thrill is the alarming shake generated by the unusual track design.
The ride itself has been open since the mid 80's as a mine like car ride with no hills or wooden tracks. The original ride's opening was delayed for a long time before officially opening in the 1980s.

<doc id="18753042" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18753042" title="Pokuase, Ghana">
Pokuase, Ghana

Pokuase, also spelled Pokoasi, is a suburb of Accra, the prime city of Ghana and spans the area from Pokuase, leading off the Accra-Kumasi motorway (or the old Nsawam Road) on the right coming from Accra central; and leading off the motorway at Pokuase Junction and rising to ‘Okai Kwei Hill’, on the left coming from town. It is a mixture of lively retail shopping areas, with local stores, bars or 'drinking spots', bus/taxi stations, and a market. It also has 'high-end' developing residential areas, as well as the long-established gated community of ACP Estates. Pokuase Junction is one of the busy bus stops for public transport, including buses (trotros) and shared-taxis, along the Accra-Kumasi motorway. Accra is the 11th-largest metropolitan area in Africa.
The American founded NGO The Women's Trust has its head offices in Pokuase Town, as does the Ghanaian/American NGO Ghana Sustainable Aid Project. The Village of Hope Orphanage and Vocational Training college are also located off Pokuase Junction at Ayawaso.
History.
Okai Kwei Hill leads down to Ayawaso, the traditional homeland of the Ga people, the historical custodians of the land of the capital city of Accra. Okai Kwei Hill was named after the last Ga King to rule that region. Okai Kwei was reputedly an astute statesman, as seen by his relationship with the Europeans and his African neighbours. But he finally fell from power in 1680. Okai Kwei had many wives, courtiers and musicians at his court, and lived an opulent life.
At the Greater Accra Region Homowo Festival in Ayawaso there is still cultural dancing and displays, the regalia of durbars honoring the Ga chiefs, and traditional worship at the Ga sacred shrines around Okai Kwei Hill.
Transport links.
There is a train station on the hill-side at Pokuase Junction, and Pokuase is one of the stops from the line starting at Nsawam and heading into central Accra.
Pokuase is also found at a central point in a multi-sided star of roads leading to different parts of central Accra, and other major towns. From Pokuase you can drive or take local transport:
-To central Accra, along the Accra-Kumasi motorway, passing Achimota and Kwame Nkrumah Circle
-To Kumasi, along the Accra to Kumasi Motorway
-To Mallam, along the under construction Awoshie-Pokuase dual-carriageway, a section of the ECOWAS Highway, and onto Cape Coast. President John Evans Atta Mills cut the sod on 22 March 2012 for work on this road to begin. Once completed, the road will have service lanes, walkways and bicycle lanes. It is funded by the African Development Bank, French Development Agency and Government of Ghana.
-To Madina, East Legon, Legon University, the Airport and Central Accra taking the Kwabenya Kwabenya road, then turning right. Kwabenya Road will become a continuation of the ECOWAS Highway, once the flyover at ACP Junction has been completed.
-To Aburi, also taking the Kwabenya Road and turning left at Kwabenya
-To Lapaz, then to the Tetteh Quashie Interchange, and to Central Accra
The Accra-Kumasi motorway is one of the major arterial roads in Ghana, going from Accra to beyond Kumasi and on to the Northern areas of Ghana, then to Bukina Faso. The stretch of this road from Nsawam to Ofankor, passing Pokuase, is a 4-lane dual carriageway; then from Ofankor to Achimota, it is an 8-lane motorway, with 4 'express' centre lanes, and 4 'local access' lanes. The road from Ofankor also has 9 feet wide pavements for pedestrian shopping.
The completion of this motorway is bringing new housing estates and 'gated community' developments to the area, as well as shopping complexes, which are under construction along the route.
The ECOWAS HIGHWAY
The Ghana section of this major motorway, linking west Africa, is now underway, with the construction of a 200 feet, multi-lane highway passing through Pokuase, along Okai Kwei hill, and across the Accra-Kumasi motorway, on through Kwabenya-Madina-East Legon, and joining Tema.
Surrounding areas.
There are places of historical and cultural interest, telling the personal history of communities in Accra, all around:
-The Reverend John Teye Memorial School, close to Pokuase, is the most established music academy in Ghana, and boast many famous Ghanaians as alumni, including John Quansah,Dj Lalo,Senanu Gbedawu, and Jimmy Quist, presenter at Citi FM.
-St John's Grammar School, at St John's located between Pokuase and Achimota
-Nsawam Medium Security Prison
-Blue Skies fruit farm and juice bar
-Achimota, which is along the motorway going into central Accra. In Achimota there is perhaps the largest completed bus station in Ghana, with transport going to all over the country. Achimota also has a golf club, which was founded by the Scots and English teachers who came to the then 'Gold Coast' in last century to establish and teach in one of the earliest and most prestigious schools in Ghana, ‘Achimota School’. There is also the Forest Reserve and housing a small Zoo.
-The historic town of Nsawam is famous for being the administrative centre of commercial coco production in colonial Ghana. It once hosted the Prince of Wales, on his visit to Ghana, and has many historic buildings (though needing renovation), and the bustling Nsawam market.
- Aburi is yet another town with a colonial history and is the location of 'Aburi Gardens', a beautiful botanical paradise created during the colonial era, with contributions from the Caribbean (particularly Jamaican) missionaries who came to Ghana in the mid-1800s to bring Christianity. In fact, in the Aburi region can be found a number of churches and even wells built by this missionary community, and one area is actually still called ‘Jamaica’! Aburi also has the popular road-side wood carvers market, where you can find many bargains; and Rita Marley lives here, the widow of legend Bob Marley and one of the I-Threes. She has a recording studio and is patron of several community development projects.
-Amasaman is the administrative capital of the Ga South Municipal area of Greater Accra, and one of the districtsdistrict capitals of Ghana. The Ga South district is one of the new districts and municipalities created in 2008 by the then President, John Agyekum John Kufuor, and was inaugurated on 29 February 2008.
-Myeera, found just off Pokuase, is the location of one of the many infamous slave markets in Ghana, where human beings were once sold.

Guerau de Massanet

Guerau de Massanet or Maçanet () was a Catalan nobleman and poet of the early fifteenth century. He is known only from his writings and those of others. Johan Basset dedicated his "Letovari" to him, whom he called a friend from "temps passat" ("times passed").
Biography.
Massanet debated in a "partimen" with the lawyer Gabriel Ferruç whether it was preferable to resolve conflicts militarily or judicially. Unsurprisingly, Ferruç the lawyer argued the latter while Massanet, probably of the knightly class, defended the private war. The poem runs eighty-eight lines, with the incipit "Amichs Garaus, en cuy fis prets s'agença". The debaters present the historian with many interesting allusions to contemporary events, but failing to resolve their dilemma they instead asked two others to judge their debate. Massanet nominated Johan d'Olivella, but had recently been named veguer of Tàrrega and could not. Ferruç' nominee, Jacme Ripoll, another lawyer, found in favour of the judicial resolution. 
Massanet also wrote an "dansa" the begins "Amors joy mi renovelha". Each verse ends with the refrain "mirant la flor de l'ametlha" (or "amenlha", "watching the flower of the almond tree"). This poem is praised both by Martí de Riquer i Morera and Josep Romeu i Figueras for its beauty, delicacy, and originality. Though written in the language and style of the troubadours of the "classical epoch" ("c".1160–1220) and infused with the sentiments of courtly love, it lacks the desperation and the rhetorical flourish associated with Catalan poets of the late Middle Ages. A reference to "Sancta Marcelha" in the fourth stanza is enough to indicate the poet's piety. The first lines of the second stanza goes like this:

In 2008, Be The Change, Inc. partnered with Points of Light Institute, Civic Enterprises, and City Year to host a bipartisan summit on national service and civic engagement and was underwritten by AARP, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Target Corporation, and "Time" magazine. ServiceNation was launched at the summit, called the ServiceNation Presidential Candidates Forum and Summit, held on September 11–12, 2008 at Columbia University in New York City.
The Summit honored and featured the coalition of more than 300 organizations who support the vision of expanding national service opportunities. Notable attendees included: New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, then-Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Martin Luther King III, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Queen Noor of Jordan, Caroline Kennedy, Wendy Kopp, Admiral Mike Mullen, then-Florida Governor Charlie Crist, and many others.
The main event was a forum attended by both 2008 presidential candidates, Senator John McCain and then-Senator Barack Obama, moderated by Richard Stengel, managing editor of "Time" magazine, with PBS "NewsHour" anchor Judy Woodruff. New York’s Governor at the time, David Paterson, welcomed the audience. The forum showcased both candidates’ views on national service and civic engagement. McCain highlighted the public-private partnerships such as Teach For America that have been successful while Obama emphasized the importance of young people being part of something larger than themselves.
At the Summit, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Caroline Kennedy, speaking on behalf of her uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) proposed legislation for expanding national service in America. Co-sponsored by Senators Hatch and Kennedy, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act passed within the first 100 days of President Barack Obama’s first term on April 21, 2009. ServiceNation was a strong advocate for the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which sanctions a significant increase in federal funding for nationwide service programs such as AmeriCorps. This legislation was passed with bipartisan support by the Senate and House on March 30, 2009. It expanded national service, pledging to increase the number of AmeriCorps members to 250,000 by 2017, among other provisions. ServiceNation played a leading role in drafting and advocating for the passage of this legislation. At the summit, Senator Chris Dodd also unveiled two bills to promote community service among high school students and seniors.
After the summit, ServiceNation planned a Day of Action for September 27 in which organizers across the nation planned more than 2,300 activities. The Day of Action focused on people signing a Declaration of Service pledging to complete 50 hours of service in the next year.
Civilian military initiative.
On Veteran’s Day, November 11, 2009, ServiceNation launched a civilian-military initiative called Mission Serve to connect civilian and military communities through shared service and volunteerism. The Veteran’s Day event was kicked-off with First Lady Michelle Obama, Dr. Jill Biden, and Mrs. Alma Powell. Mission Serve launched with 36 newly formed civilian-military partnerships.
From 2009 to 2011, Mission Serve organized annual service events across the country on Veteran’s Day that united civilian and military communities through service projects. In 2011, notable participants included General Stanley A. McChrystal, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Yankees manager Joe Girardi, the cast of Hawaii Five-0, Brandon Routh, Megan Fox, Laird Hamilton, Gabby Reece, and many others. The centerpiece of the day was veterans and military families working with civilians to help other veterans in order to empower veterans.
In 2011, Be the Change and ServiceNation convened major Hollywood studios, networks, talent agencies, and guilds in the entertainment industry for a yearlong discussion of veteran’s issues. The result was the industry signing on to an awareness and activation campaign called Got Your 6 to change the conversation about veterans and military families. The Mission Serve initiative evolved into this campaign and became Got Your 6.
Merger.
In early 2012, ServeNext, a nonprofit launched in 2007 to advocate for national service programs like AmeriCorps through grassroots advocacy joined the umbrella of ServiceNation initiatives.

Current priorities.
As of April 2013, ServiceNation is pursuing several priorities: expanding national service, amending the GI Bill, and increasing awareness about national service in America.
In partnership with its sister campaign, Got Your 6, ServiceNation works to promote expansion of opportunities for veterans to continue to serve the nation. More than one million military service members will return to civilian life in the next five years and most are eligible for GI Bill benefits. However, only 36% use their benefits. Introducing the option of using part of GI Bill benefits to spend a year in service to the country will provide transition time as well as pathway to education and jobs.
ServiceNation also pursues expanding national service opportunities through grassroots advocacy. Full-time field organizers and volunteer district captains engage key supporters in targeted local areas to build support for national service. These organizers and District Captains work with elected officials, the media, key decision makers, nonprofit partners, AmeriCorps Alums, and others to help educate about the value of national service.
ServiceNation Coalition.
Since 2008, the ServiceNation Coalition has united organizations across the country who support universal national service and commit to using grassroots action to let elected officials and the nation’s leaders know. More than 300 organizations are currently part of the coalition including national organizations and local affiliates.
Criticism.
Service Nation has been criticized by libertarians, "National Review" Editor Jonah Goldberg, and the John Birch Society.

USS Raritan (WYT-93)

The second USS "Raritan" (WYT-93) was a United States Coast Guard harbor tug that served in the United States Navy from 1941 to 1946.
"Raritan" was built for the Coast Guard by Defoe Boat Works, Bay City, Michigan, and was launched on 23 March 1939. After commissioning, the ship was assigned harbor duties at Boston, Massachusetts.
Executive Order 8929 of 1 November 1941 transferred the entire Coast Guard from the United States Department of the Treasury to the United States Navy. "Raritan" continued duty in the Boston Harbor area through the end of World War II in 1945.
After the Coast Guard was returned to the Treasury Department on 1 January 1946 in accordance with Executive Order 9666, "Raritan" continued to operate in Boston Harbor. She subsequently was transferred to Portsmouth, Virginia. and in 1962 she was assigned to the Great Lakes.
"Raritan's" career after that awaits further research.
"Raritan" was decommissioned from Coast Guard service in 1988.

Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal

Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal, 492 U.S. 257 (1989), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable fines does not apply to punitive-damage awards in civil cases when the United States is not a party.
Prior history.
Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI) had been the dominant provider of roll-off trash collection services in the Burlington, Vermont market since it entered the roll-off market in 1976. Joseph Kelley was a district manager for BFI until 1980, when he left to found his own company, Kelco Disposal. By 1982, Kelco had garnered over 40% of the roll-off market; in that year, BFI began a campaign of predatory pricing, which continued for several months, with the intent of driving Kelco out of the business. In 1985, BFI sold their Burlington operations to another company.
In 1984, Kelco filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont alleging that BFI had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Kelco also claimed, as an alternative state-law cause of action, that BFI interfered with its contracts with its customers. In the subsequent jury trial, BFI was found liable on both claims. In a separate one-day trial on the damages, the jury settled on compensatory damages of $51,146, and punitive damages of $6 million. The trial court then awarded Kelco treble damages and attorney's fees on the anti-trust claim, but awarded $6,066,082.74 on the alternative state tort claim, so further action proceeded on the basis of the higher award.
BFI appealed the judgment to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and raised the issue of the excessive fines clause. The Second Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision on both liability and damages, finding for the sake of argument that the jury's punitive-damage award was not excessive whether or not the Eighth Amendment applied to this case. The Supreme Court granted "certiorari" to consider the specific question of whether the excessive fines clause applies to civil cases involving purely private parties.

2008–09 Zimbabwean political negotiations

The 2008–2009 Zimbabwean political negotiations between the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (led by Morgan Tsvangirai), its small splinter group, the Movement for Democratic Change - Mutambara (led by Arthur Mutambara), and the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (led by Robert Mugabe) are intended to negotiate an end to the partisan violence and human rights violations in Zimbabwe and create a framework for a power-sharing executive government between the two parties. These negotiations followed the 2008 presidential election, in which Mugabe was controversially re-elected, as well as the 2008 parliamentary election, in which the MDC won a majority in the House of Assembly.
Preliminary talks to set up conditions for official negotiations began between leading negotiators from both parties on 10 July, and on 22 July, the three party leaders met for the first time in Harare to express their support for a negotiated settlement of disputes arising out of the presidential and parliamentary elections. Negotiations between the parties officially began on 25 July and are currently proceeding with very few details released from the negotiation teams in Pretoria, as coverage by the media was barred from the premises where the negotiations took place. The talks were mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki.
A final deal was reached on 11 September 2008, providing for Mugabe to remain President while Tsvangirai would become Prime Minister. The deal was signed on 15 September; negotiations continue regarding the composition of a new Cabinet.
Details of the talks.
Preliminary negotiations.
Mbeki met with Mugabe on 5 July; Arthur Mutambara, Welshman Ncube, and Priscilla Misihairabwi-Mushonga of the MDC-Mutambara group also participated in the discussions. Although Tsvangirai's MDC organisation was not invited to participate, it declined to do so, reiterating its refusal to recognise Mugabe as President and saying that discussions should take place only in the presence of an AU-appointed mediator. Mbeki nevertheless expressed hopes that Tsvangirai's party would participate. Patrick Chinamasa stressed that the government was committed to dialogue with both MDC groupings, but said that Tsvangirai had committed "an act of utter disrespect" by failing to appear at the talks. Mutambara also stated that the involvement of all parties was necessary.
Talks between the parties began in Pretoria on 10 July. ZANU-PF and both MDC groupings were present for the talks, although Tsvangirai said that his group's delegation, led by Biti, was present to explain its conditions for negotiations—which included an end to the violence, the release of MDC prisoners, and the appointment of an AU envoy— not to actually participate in negotiations. Chamisa described the discussions as merely "talks about whether to have talks, really just a consultation". ZANU-PF was represented in the talks by Chinamasa and Goche.
In a report from the Human Sciences Research Council, a policy group in South Africa, that was released on 10 July, Peter Kagwanja wrote that violence perpetrated against ZANU-PF by MDC supporters, which he described as having previously been spontaneous, was becoming more organised, and he warned that this increased the possibility of a civil war. Chamisa, however, denied that the MDC had been responsible for any violence.
On 11 July, the MDC said that Gift Mutsvungunu, a party official, had been found dead near Harare on the previous day; his body was said to be burned and his eyes gouged out. The MDC suspected the security forces of responsibility for this killing, and the party said that its total number of dead during the violence had reached 113. Chamisa said on 13 July that no agreement had been reached and that the two sides "still have to clear the course for meaningful talks". According to Chamisa, violence against MDC members and supporters was continuing, and he said that it was "difficult to engage in meaningful dialogue" under the circumstances. Zimbabwe's "Sunday Mail", however, reported on the same day that an agreement had been reached on a "working framework" for talks.
14 MDC activists, who were being held on charges of violence, were acquitted and released on 14 July, according to the MDC. This followed the death on the same day of a police officer who was the key witness against the activists. On 15 July, church leaders in Zimbabwe said that the "will of the people of Zimbabwe was not given authentic expression during these elections" due to the violence, and they expressed willingness to assist in making arrangements for the formation of a national unity government.
Mugabe launched a food subsidy programme on 16 July; this programme, involving coupons for food, was designed to counter continually rising inflation and what Mugabe described as "unjust price increases" by private businesses. He also accused the UK of seeking to control Zimbabwe's resources on this occasion. Also on 16 July, the pro-MDC Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions condemned the second round and urged the appointment of a prominent AU envoy to assist in mediation.
Agreement and Memorandum.
Kenyan Prime Minister Odinga said on 20 July that the two parties had "agreed a framework for negotiation" and that he expected this agreement to be signed later in the same week. According to Odinga, the talks that would follow this agreement would be held in Pretoria and would still be mediated by Mbeki, but with AU and UN supervision. Also on 20 July, Zimbabwe's "Sunday Mail" reported that any companies with Western investments would be taken over by Zimbabweans or by "companies from friendly countries, particularly those in the Far East" if they acted on Western calls to stop doing business in Zimbabwe.
ZANU-PF and both groups of the MDC signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining a framework for talks on 21 July in Harare. Both Mugabe and Tsvangirai were present to sign the agreement; they shook hands on this occasion, and it was reportedly the first time they had met in about 10 years. According to Mbeki, who was also present, the agreement "commits the negotiating parties to an intense program of work to try and finalize negotiations as quickly as possible". Mugabe said that the aim of the talks was to "chart a new way, a new way of political interaction", while Tsvangirai described the agreement as "the first tentative step towards searching for a solution for a country that is in crisis". Under the terms of the agreement, the parties agreed to end political violence and work towards a national unity government and a new constitution; the agreement also required that the parties not use the media as a means of negotiation and set the period for negotiations at two weeks. Mbeki's spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga subsequently said that this was not a strict limit and talks could continue after two weeks if necessary.
Round 1 (22 – 30 July).
Following the preliminary agreement, talks between ZANU-PF and the MDC reportedly began on 22 July in South Africa. Ratshitanga said on 23 July that the talks had begun at an undisclosed location, but Chinamasa said that they were to start on 24 July. "The Herald" reported on 24 July that negotiating teams for both parties took the same flight to South Africa on 23 July. Meanwhile, the South African newspaper "Business Day" reported that the two sides had already reached agreement on most of the issues, although details remained to be decided.
"The Herald" reported on 25 July that the ZANU-PF Politburo had decided that any agreement with the opposition must leave Mugabe in office as President and must not threaten land reform. Ratshitanga said on 26 July that the talks were "proceeding well", although he gave no details.
Stalling.
On 28 July, an MDC official said that the talks had stalled due to disagreement on the question of who would lead the government; according to the official, Tsvangirai had been offered the position of Vice-President, but the MDC was unwilling to accept any deal that did not place Tsvangirai at the head of the government. Speaking on 29 July, however, Mbeki said that the talks were continuing and that they were going "very well". The talks adjourned on 29 July. Mbeki said on 30 July that the talks were adjourned so that the negotiators could consult with their leaders and that they would resume on 3 August. He met with Tsvangirai in Pretoria on 29 July and with Mugabe in Harare on 30 July. For his part, Mugabe said that the talks were going well and that the negotiators were working towards a compromise.
Speaking on 30 July, Tsvangirai expressed his hope that the negotiations would result in an "honourable exit" for Mugabe; he also said that Mugabe was "just as human as every one of us", while asserting that he was "ignorant, or chooses to be in denial, as far as the violence is concerned". During a visit to Senegal in which he met with Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, Tsvangirai said on 31 July that he was "fairly satisfied" with the way the negotiations were proceeding, while acknowledging that some "sticking points" remained.
An explosion occurred at Harare's central police station late on 2 August, damaging it but causing no casualties. According to a police statement, the explosion was caused by a bomb planted on the building's first floor; it said that one additional bomb that had not exploded was recovered from the scene.
Round 2 (3 – 12 August).
The talks resumed on 3 August. On the same day, as part of its "Let's Talk for a Change" campaign, the MDC had an advertisement published in "The Standard", in which it acknowledged that Mugabe had taken a positive step by accepting power-sharing negotiations. Ratshitanga said on the next day that the renewed negotiations were proceeding well and that the negotiating parties were not concerned about meeting the deadline, which had been set for 4 August.
A South African newspaper, "The Star", reported on 5 August that an agreement was near; according to "The Star", this agreement would create the post of Prime Minister for Tsvangirai, while Mugabe would remain in office as President, but in a ceremonial capacity. "The Star" also reported that MDC wanted the transitional period that followed the agreement to last for 24 to 30 months, while ZANU-PF wanted it to last for five years.
"The Herald" reported on the same day that the parties had agreed to expand their negotiating teams. ZANU-PF and the MDC made a joint statement on 6 August calling for an end to violence.
Another deadlock.
In a statement on 7 August, Mugabe said that the reports regarding a draft agreement were "utter nonsense"; he also denied reports that he was planning to meet with Tsvangirai. According to Mugabe, the talks were "going on very well", and he said that "the people of Zimbabwe shall be informed in due course". However, Mbeki went to Harare on 9 August, and Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba said that Mugabe would meet with Tsvangirai on 10 August, while reports suggested the signing of an agreement was imminent.
On 10 August, Mbeki met with Tsvangirai in Harare, then met with Mugabe. Zimbabwe's "The Sunday Mail" reported on the same day that "a common position" to keep Mugabe in office as President had been agreed upon. Following further negotiations at a hotel in Harare, Mugabe said when leaving the hotel on 11 August that they were "not exactly" going well, but that they would continue on the next day.
On 12 August, the power-sharing negotiations continued, with reports indicating that the MDC-T and ZANU-PF were still deadlocked. Mugabe and Mutambara (of the MDC-M) were reported to have signed an agreement on 12 August that excluded Tsvangirai, but later in the day Mbeki denied that a deal was signed between any of the three negotiating parties, stating that Tsvangirai had left the negotiations earlier in the day to reflect on them. MDC-M Secretary-General Welshman Ncube also said that no agreement had been reached.
SADC Summit.
The round of talks in Harare ended on the night of 12 August. Tsvangirai expressed continued commitment to dialogue on 13 August, saying that any agreement needed to "put the people first, not leadership positions and titles"; meanwhile, Mbeki, who had left Zimbabwe, maintained that it was still "possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly". On 14 August, when Tsvangirai went to the airport in Harare to travel to Johannesburg for a SADC summit, his emergency travel documents were confiscated by members of the Central Intelligence Organisation (his passport had previously expired and he was not able to renew it); the documents were quickly returned, however, and Tsvangirai departed for the summit. According to Charamba, Mugabe's spokesman, Tsvangirai's documents were only valid for travel to Angola, and he denied MDC claims that two other members of the MDC delegation to the summit, Biti and Eliphas Mukonoweshuro, had their passports confiscated as well. Charamba accused Tsvangirai of purposefully attempting to travel with invalid documents so that he could use the resulting incident for political gain. Meanwhile, it was announced that Ian Khama, the President of Botswana, would not attend the summit unless an agreement was reached in Zimbabwe.
On 15 August, the day before the summit, Tsvangirai spoke to a gathering of Cabinet ministers from the SADC countries. In this speech, he acknowledged that the MDC and ZANU-PF remained divided on the question of how executive powers should be allocated in the national unity government. According to Tsvangirai, the sides had agreed on leaving Mugabe in office as President and establishing a new position of Prime Minister for himself. Tsvangirai explained that he wanted to have strong, executive powers: as Prime Minister, he "must chair the Cabinet and be responsible for the formulation, execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers", stressing that he could not succeed in the role if he was given "responsibility without authority". Mugabe, according to Tsvangirai's proposal, would be a head of state without veto power; he would remain commander-in-chief of the military, but would act in that capacity on Tsvangirai's advice. ZANU-PF, on the other hand, favoured an agreement in which Tsvangirai would become Prime Minister while Mugabe would remain in charge of the Cabinet.
At the summit on 16 August, SADC leaders held talks with Mugabe and Tsvangirai. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai told "The New York Times" that he would only accept an agreement that gave him the executive powers necessary to properly govern the country, and he said that "it's better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal". Biti said that he thought the odds of the talks ending successfully were "fifty-fifty". The SADC summit ended on 17 August, with the two sides still unable to agree. Mbeki said that the negotiations would continue after the summit; Biti, speaking for the MDC, expressed continued commitment to dialogue, as did Zimbabwe's Minister of Information, Sikhanyiso Ndlovu. In a statement, the SADC leaders called on the parties to "conclude the negotiations as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in Zimbabwe".
Convening Parliament.
The SADC leaders' statement also included the suggestion "that while negotiations are continuing, it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people". On 19 August, the government announced its intention to convene Parliament in the subsequent week, five months after the parliamentary election was held. The MDC said on the same day that it did not oppose convening Parliament as long as it was not accompanied by the formation of a new Cabinet, desiring that the new Cabinet should be appointed only after the conclusion of a power-sharing agreement. On 20 August, however, the MDC took a firmer stance, declaring the move to convene Parliament to be unacceptable, with Biti stating that it would "be a clear repudiation of the Memorandum of Understanding, and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of ZANU-PF's unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks. In short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue". While on a visit to Nairobi, Tsvangirai said on 21 August that convening Parliament and appointing a Cabinet would violate the conditions of the talks, according to which each step in the process was to be taken by common consensus, and suggested that Mugabe's decision could mean he was "abandon the basis for the talks". He also referred to the need to balance the powers that would be held by the President and Prime Minister under a power-sharing arrangement, whereby both would possess both responsibility and authority.
Despite the MDC-T's objections, the members of Parliament were sworn in on 25 August. On the same day, an election was held for the post of Speaker of Parliament; the vote resulted in a victory for MDC-T candidate Lovemore Moyo, who received 110 out of 208 votes in a secret ballot. ZANU-PF did not present a candidate against Moyo and instead supported Paul Themba Nyathi of the MDC-M.
On 27 August, Moyo, the newly elected Speaker, said in an interview that the talks would continue. "The Herald" reported comments by Mugabe on 27 August in which he said that he would soon form a new government; he also said that it appeared the MDC did not want to participate in that government. According to Mugabe, the MDC "been promised by the British that sanctions would be more devastating, that in six months time the government will collapse". He sharply criticised the preceding Cabinet as "the worst in history" and said that the new Cabinet would be composed of "managers". MDC-T spokesman Chamisa said that Mugabe had no mandate to form a Cabinet and that doing so would be "a recipe for disaster", urging him to wait and reach an agreement with the MDC; meanwhile, MDC-M spokesman Edwin Mushoriwa also said that his group would not participate in a government formed without an agreement.
Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga reiterated on 28 August that Mugabe intended to form a Cabinet, saying that this was necessary for the country to move forward, to improve the economy and alleviate suffering. According to Matonga, Mugabe had received a mandate from SADC. MDC-T spokesman Biti, meanwhile, said that the formation of a Cabinet would mean "killing the talks" and that it would be "a disaster and an act of insanity" for Mugabe to attempt to "go it alone". He also said that the MDC was planning to write to Mbeki to protest Mugabe's alleged violations of the July preliminary agreement. Some observers speculated that, by announcing his intention to form a Cabinet, Mugabe was attempting to force the MDC into accepting the power-sharing conditions favoured by ZANU-PF.
ZANU-PF and MDC delegations met separately with Mbeki on 29 August. On the next day, "The Herald" reported that ZANU-PF had rejected a new MDC proposal, according to which Mugabe and Tsvangirai would co-chair the Cabinet. "The Herald" denounced this proposal as "absurd" and "insolent", saying that it displayed "stunning ignorance on how government works". MDC-T spokesman Chamisa said on 31 August that "nothing was achieved" in the talks two days prior and that the negotiators had returned to Zimbabwe. The chairman of the Executive Council of the African Union, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Bernard Membe said on 2 September that the African Union hoped that an immediate agreement, providing for power to be split equally between ZANU-PF and the MDC, was still possible.
On 3 September, according to "The Herald", Mugabe said while attending Levy Mwanawasa's funeral in Zambia that he would form a Cabinet unless the MDC-T signed a power-sharing agreement by 4 September. "The Herald" quoted Mugabe as saying that it was unacceptable for the country to go on indefinitely without a new Cabinet. Biti said that the MDC-T had heard nothing about Mugabe's threat except what was published in "The Herald". According to Biti, the talks were at a stalemate, but he expressed continued commitment to them, while also saying that if Mugabe formed a Cabinet unilaterally, the dialogue would be destroyed. "The Herald" also reported that Mugabe again alleged that the MDC-T was resisting an agreement due to British influence; Biti responded that this was "patronizing".
US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer said on 5 September that negotiations should continue, warning that her government would consider a Cabinet formed unilaterally by Mugabe to be a "sham". MDC-T leader Tsvangirai on 7 September called for early elections under international supervision if the talks failed.
Round 3 (9 September – present).
On 9 September 2008, talks resumed with new proposals, with Mbeki flying in from South Africa to mediate. A fresh proposal by Mbeki was tabled that would propose making Tsvangirai an executive prime minister; all three leaders of the major political parties spoke of progress in the talks, and reports of Mugabe backing down on his earlier threats to exclude the MDC surfaced in the foreign press. The day before, Mutambara's group of the MDC announced that they would refuse to work with ZANU-PF if talks were deadlocked. Both Tsvangirai and Mugabe spoke positively of the talks on 10 September 2008.
Final power-sharing deal.
Leaving the talks on 11 September, Tsvangirai told the press that a deal had been reached. Mbeki said later in the day that the deal would be signed in Harare on 15 September in the presence of other African leaders; he did not explain the terms of the deal, saying that they would not be revealed until the deal was signed. The Zimbabwean Permanent Representative to the UN, Boniface Chidyausiku, described the agreement as a "triumph for African diplomacy".
The SADC postponed a meeting of its defence committee indefinitely until Mbeki could finalise a unity deal in Zimbabwe; while confirming that he would attend the meeting, Mbeki told journalists that, if the deal fell through at the last minute, he would tell the SADC that he had done his best as mediator, and that the deal would fall through because one or more of the parties were not serious about the negotiations.
At the end of the fourth day of negotiations Mbeki announced that Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and Mutambara had signed a power-sharing agreement – "memorandum of understanding." Mbeki stated: "An agreement has been reached on all items on the agenda ... all of them Tsvangirai, Mutambara endorsed the document tonight, and signed it. The formal signing will be done on Monday 10 am. The document will be released then. The ceremony will be attended by SADC and other African regional and continental leaders. The leaders will spend the next few days constituting the inclusive government to be announced on Monday. The leaders will work very hard to mobilise support for the people to recover. We hope the world will assist so that this political agreement succeeds." The deal is also expected to result in a "de facto" amnesty for the military and Zanu-PF party leaders. Opposition sources said "Tsvangirai will become prime minister at the head of a council of ministers, the principal organ of government, drawn from his Movement for Democratic Change and the president's Zanu-PF party; and Mugabe will remain president and continue to chair a cabinet that will be a largely consultative body, and the real power will lie with Tsvangirai." South Africa's Business Day reported, however, that Mugabe was refusing to sign a deal which would curtail his presidential powers. According to "The New York Times", MDC spokesman Chamisa announced: “This is an inclusive government. The executive power would be shared by the president, the prime minister and the cabinet. Mugabe, Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara have still not decided how to divide the ministries. But Jendayi E. Frazer, the American assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said: “We don’t know what’s on the table, and it’s hard to rally for an agreement when no one knows the details or even the broad outlines”.
Reportedly, the deal includes the following provisions:
An MDC official said on 13 September that the MDC wanted to control the key ministries of home affairs, finance, and justice; in return, the official said that the MDC was willing to concede the ministries of defence and state security to ZANU-PF.
On 15 September 2008, SADC leaders witnessed the signing of the power-sharing agreement, brokered by Mbeki. With a symbolic handshake and warm smiles at the Rainbow Towers hotel, in Harare, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed the deal to end the violent political crisis. Under the terms of the deal, Mugabe will remain President, Tsvangirai will become Prime Minister, the MDC will control the police, ZANU-PF will control the Army, and Mutambara will become Deputy Prime Minister.
Negotiations on Cabinet composition.
The parties planned to hold talks regarding the allocation of Cabinet portfolios beginning on 16 September, but these talks were delayed. In "The Herald" on 17 September, Chinamasa said that the necessary constitutional amendments to provide a legal basis for some aspects of the agreement would be considered by Parliament after it began sitting on 14 October. However, he also said that other aspects of the agreement would not require constitutional amendments. Mugabe, in a speech to the ZANU-PF Central Committee that was broadcast live on 17 September, described the agreement as a "humiliation", but said that the party could have avoided the situation if it had not "blundered" in March, when it failed to win a parliamentary majority. However, he asserted that ZANU-PF was still in "the driving seat" and would "not tolerate any nonsense" from the MDC. The Central Committee approved the agreement, while expressing concern that attacks against ZANU-PF supporters could have a negative effect on relations between the parties. On the same day, Tsvangirai said that he was confident that the deal would hold and that Mugabe was committed to it.
The parties held talks regarding the allocation of portfolios on 18 September, but according to Chamisa, the MDC-T spokesman, no agreement was reached and "the matter referred to the negotiators". The negotiators met on 19 September, but according to Chamisa they failed to reach an agreement. Chamisa said that ZANU-PF had a "take, take and take mentality" and wanted to hold all of the most important portfolios, while the MDC favoured a "give and take situation" in which the most important portfolios would be divided fairly. In particular, the MDC wanted to control the finance portfolio, justifying this by pointing to the disastrous state of the economy, but ZANU-PF objected.
Mugabe's trip to New York.
With the situation still unresolved, Mugabe embarked on a trip to the United Nations on 19 September; the MDC complained that he did not swear in Tsvangirai before leaving for this trip, which was expected to last at least a week. Vice-President Joseph Msika was responsible for handling Mugabe's duties while he was out of the country. Chamisa said that Mugabe was unwilling to leave the country in Tsvangirai's hands during his absence. A column in "The Herald" on 20 September belittled the agreement, saying that Mugabe remained free to appoint a Cabinet of his choosing and was only required to consult with the Prime Minister; it also said that the agreement could "collapse any day". Aside from this, Tsvangirai expressed concern regarding the stark and bitter language in the column (which was generally believed to have been written by Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba, under the pen name Nathaniel Manheru), describing it as hateful. One passage in the column seemed to suggest violence, saying that an audit of land reform, as provided by the agreement, would "draw blood redder than the setting sun." Although Tsvangirai emphasised that he did not think the column's writer was expressing Mugabe's views, he said that if the column reflected ZANU-PF's attitude, the agreement was already doomed.
Ouster of Mbeki from South African presidency.
Only a few days after the agreement was signed, Mbeki was forced to resign as President of South Africa by his party, the African National Congress (ANC). This raised additional concerns about the future of the agreement; it was unclear if Mbeki would continue to act as mediator, and it was unclear if South Africa, under new leadership, would remain so heavily involved in resolving Zimbabwe's political situation. Jakaya Kikwete, the President of Tanzania and Chairman of the African Union, said on 24 September that "the South African government ... will continue to focus on the issue", while SADC spokesman Charles Mubita said that Mbeki would continue to act as mediator. According to Mubita, Mbeki was appointed as mediator "based on his knowledge, understanding and acumen of the situation" and did not necessarily need to be a sitting president to serve in that role. For his part, Mugabe was quoted in "The Herald" on 25 September as saying that Mbeki's removal as President of South Africa was "devastating" and "very disturbing", while also stating that it was "the action of the South African people" and that as a Zimbabwean he was in no position to judge. Mbeki's successor, Kgalema Motlanthe, said on 2 October that he wanted Mbeki to continue mediating. On 3 October, a spokesman for the South African government announced that Mbeki had agreed to continue in his role as mediator.
Mugabe returned to Zimbabwe from the UN on 29 September. He said upon returning that "there is no deadlock" and that only four ministries were left to be decided. According to Mugabe, the Cabinet would be formed later in the same week. On 30 September, Mugabe and Tsvangirai met, but they were unable to reach an agreement on the allocation of Cabinet portfolios and "the matter was referred to the mediator", according to Chamisa. Chamisa argued that if the portfolios were allocated according to ZANU-PF's wishes, then ZANU-PF would control the government and the MDC would be "a mere cosmetic accessory and mere lipstick". He warned that this was "completely unacceptable" and that the MDC was not so "desperate to be in the government" that it would accept a secondary status. ZANU-PF's Chinamasa, however, denied that there was any deadlock in negotiations and said that all parties were committed to reaching an agreement. He said that any disagreement that might exist was insufficient to warrant Mbeki's intervention and expressed confidence that the matter could be resolved without his help.
Further negotiations between party leaders.
Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and Mutambara met in Harare on 4 October for talks on the distribution of portfolios, but could not reach an agreement; according to Charamba, Mugabe's spokesman, the negotiating teams would meet again to discuss the allocation of the portfolios of finance and home affairs. Spokesmen for the MDC-T and the MDC-M also acknowledged the failure to reach an agreement and said that negotiations would continue. The MDC-T's Chamisa said on 5 October that all of the Cabinet portfolios were in question, not just two of them, as claimed by Charamba.
The negotiators met briefly on 7 October but again failed to reach an agreement. According to Chamisa, the parties were "still in different worlds in a fundamental way". For his part, Biti said that he and fellow MDC negotiator Elton Mangoma left the meeting in outrage after the ZANU-PF negotiators said that they were only present "to justify why they needed the two ministries of home affairs and finance". Biti insisted that the MDC had never agreed to the allocation of any ministries and that it was deceptive for ZANU-PF to claim that there were only two in dispute. He expressed hope that Mbeki could help resolve the situation, saying that if Mbeki was unsuccessful the only remaining hope was divine intervention. It was reported at this time that the power-sharing agreement was near collapse; reportedly, some members of the ZANU-PF leadership were adamant that the party needed to hold the key portfolios, believing that ZANU-PF would be in grave danger if it did not control those ministries. ANC President Jacob Zuma said on the same day that he hoped the Zimbabwean parties could reach an agreement on their own, but he also said that Mbeki was available to facilitate the negotiations if necessary.
Tsvangirai said on 9 October that the talks were deadlocked and progress was impossible unless Mbeki intervened. Meanwhile, Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu dismissed the claim of a deadlock entirely: "Deadlock is the figment of imagination by our detractors from outside Zimbabwe". According to Ndlovu, it was necessary for ZANU-PF to "teach art of government formation and implementation of policies" to the MDC, as they were "still new". Nevertheless, Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and Mutambara met on 10 October and agreed that Mbeki's mediation was needed.
Announcement of cabinet.
On 11 October, "The Herald" published an official list showing the allocation of ministries to the three parties; defence, home affairs, foreign affairs, justice, and local government were among the 14 portfolios allotted to ZANU-PF. The MDC-T's 13 portfolios included constitutional and parliamentary affairs, economic planning and investment promotion, labour and social welfare, sport, arts and culture, and science and technology development, while the MDC-M's three portfolios were listed as education, regional integration and international co-operation, and industry and commerce. According to "The Herald", only the finance ministry remained in dispute, and it said that Mbeki would travel to Zimbabwe to assist in negotiations on the matter. The allocations published in "The Herald" were not approved by the MDC-T, which rejected them outright. MDC-T spokesman Chamisa denounced the publication of the list as "unilateral, contemptuous and outrageous", saying that such imbalance in the importance of the portfolios would effectively give ZANU-PF control of the government. He warned that ZANU-PF's "arrogance" would "put the deal into jeopardy". At a rally in Harare on 12 October, Tsvangirai said that the MDC-T would withdraw from the agreement if ZANU-PF did not relent on the allocation of ministries. MDC-M spokesman Edwin Mushoriwa also rejected the list of allocated ministries, saying that it was a "hallucination on the part of ZANU-PF."
An official close to the presidency said the dilution of Mugabe's powers promised in the agreement was "illusory", and described the MDC as merely a "junior partner" whose only role would be "to gain legitimacy and international funds". ZANU-PF planned to take the ministries of defence, justice, home affairs, farming, information, and mines. The mining sector is the last occasionally functioning part of the economy given the country's wealth of natural resources and this carries huge opportunities for corruption. The MDC would be offered the finance ministry, in an effort to persuade donors that real reform was taking place so that would trigger billions in aid and reconstruction. The presidential official said "It's a tricky situation for the MDC...Nonetheless we now have the opposition in government and they have to fix the economy, just as they told the electorate." A ministerial post involving kick starting foreign aid is seen by some as a poison chalice for the MDC. If the party were to succeed it would help shore up support for the ZANU-PF and make it harder to oust in the future, while a failure would cause the MDC to be branded as incompetent and would undermine its own support. MDC officials were said to be aware of the risk of being manipulated and refused to sign up for a ministry that lacks real authority. According to an MDC spokesman, "It would appear that Zanu-PF does not understand power-sharing. We are still poles apart, with them insisting on taking all the key ministries, literally rendering the (opposition) peripheral in government – in fact, a situation where we would be in but out of government."
Msika and Joice Mujuru were sworn in as Vice-Presidents by Mugabe on 13 October. Justice Minister Chinamasa said that this represented another step in the process and that it would be followed by the swearing in of the Prime Minister and the new Cabinet, remarking that "the locomotive has been too long at the railway station and it is now warming up its engine towards delivering services to the people". According to Chinamasa, parliamentary approval of the constitutional amendments was not necessary prior to the appointment of the Prime Minister; he said that the amendments would enable Tsvangirai and Mutambara to take up seats in Parliament, and that having seats in Parliament would merely provide them with constitutional legitimacy after they assumed office as ministers. In other comments, Chinamasa blamed the MDC for stalling the situation and complained that it was trying to renew discussion on matters that had been previously settled.
Return of Mbeki and failure of negotiations.
Later on 13 October, Mbeki arrived in Zimbabwe to facilitate negotiations. Mugabe and Tsvangirai met for over seven hours on 14 October, but no agreement was reached. Talks over the next two days did not produce an agreement, but on 16 October Mugabe expressed optimism about the possibility of an agreement being reached on the next day, stressing the "need for compromise on both sides". Chamisa said that there was "some movement, but not enough". Reportedly control of the home affairs ministry remained a key sticking point; ZANU-PF was said to offered the finance ministry to the MDC and to have proposed that the parties alternate control of the home affairs ministry, but the MDC reportedly rejected this proposal.
By 17 October, Tsvangirai announced to the press that the talks had failed due to the conflict over the home affairs ministry, and that both he and Mugabe had agreed to refer a resolution of differences to SADC; Mugabe stated that the talks had "went in the wrong direction". On 16 October, SADC had officially acknowledged that it did not recognise Mugabe as the legitimately-elected president in response to a legal application filed against it by the Zimbabwe Exiles Forum, but it rejected a request from the Forum for the rejection of Mugabe from SADC meetings due to SADC's belief that Mbeki's role as moderator in the negotiations would facilitate an end to the deadlock and bring the power-sharing deal to fruition. SADC, according to Tsvangirai, would meet on 20 October in Swaziland to discuss further proceedings; in the meantime, neither party would walk away from talks.
However, on 20 October, the scheduled meeting took place without Tsvangirai in attendance, due to a boycott called by the MDC after Tsvangirai was given a temporary one-way exit document by the Zimbabwean government that was only meant for travel to Swaziland; Swaziland is geographically landlocked by South Africa and Mozambique, and any travel to Swaziland would go through the air or groundspace of either country. The MDC took the lack of an official passport, which Tsvangirai had lacked for months prior to the scheduled talks, as a sign of the ZANU-PF's lack of consideration for the MDC or the talks, while the ZANU-PF regarded the matter as a technicality that was due to the government's lack of access to paper. The meeting, instead, brought Mugabe to discuss matters with the SADC troika of heads of state from Swaziland, Mozambique and Tanzania, also known as the "Organ on Politics, Defence and Security"; in addition, it was announced that the current South African president, Kgalema Motlanthe, would join the organ. Meanwhile, negotiations between the three parties were suspended for a week.
A new meeting was scheduled to be held in Harare on 27 October. MDC-T spokesman Chamisa said on 24 October that Tsvangirai would attend that meeting. On 25 October, Tsvangirai said that while the MDC respected SADC and the regional leaders, it would not sign an unsuitable deal at their behest. The SADC meeting in Harare was unsuccessful, with control of the home affairs ministry remaining the key sticking point. A communique issued afterwards called for a new SADC summit to be held "as a matter of urgency".
SADC ruling, cholera outbreak and Mbeki-Tsvangirai spat.
At the subsequent SADC summit in Johannesburg, the SADC leaders proposed the immediate formation of a Cabinet with shared control of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Tsvangirai rejected this and criticised SADC for not confronting Mugabe. Returning from the summit on 10 November, Mugabe said that the new Cabinet would be appointed "as quickly as possible" and expressed his hope that the MDC would accept the SADC proposal, while Chinamasa said that the MDC had been invited to submit names for the Cabinet. On 12 November, MDC-T spokesman Chamisa said that his party would not join the Cabinet until "outstanding issues such as the issue of governors, equity and allocation of key ministries" were resolved. Bright Matonga, the Deputy Minister of Information, was quoted by "The Herald" on the same day as saying that the MDC would "never hold this country to ransom" and that there was no reason why a Cabinet could not be formed without the MDC if necessary.
On 24 November, Motlanthe, the President of South Africa, urged the parties to reach an agreement, warning that if they did not, "the situation will get worse and will implode or collapse altogether". Talks between ZANU-PF and the MDC restarted in South Africa on 25 November, again mediated by Mbeki. Mbeki described the negotiations as "the same as ever, forward and backwards, sideways and around ... the usual". Tsvangirai released a statement on 26 November calling on Mbeki to step down. According to Tsvangirai, Mbeki "does not appear to understand how desperate the problem in Zimbabwe is, and the solutions he proposes are too small"; he also accused Mbeki of supporting ZANU-PF and said that the MDC could not "continue negotiating under his facilitation". Two days later, a letter from Mbeki sharply criticising Tsvangirai's position was published. In this letter, Mbeki urged Tsvangirai to "take responsibility for the future of Zimbabwe" instead of devoting himself to "being a militant critic of President Mugabe and ZANU-PF." In response to Tsvangirai's accusation that the SADC leaders lacked the courage to confront Mugabe, Mbeki said that Tsvangirai had "describeus in a manner that is most offensive in terms of African culture". He also suggested that Tsvangirai perhaps believed "that others further away, in Western Europe and North America, are of greater importance" to Zimbabwe than other countries in the region and Africa as a whole.
On 28 November, the details of the bill to change the constitution were agreed, but four other issues remained open. When asked how the talks were going, Chamisa stated that the glass was either half-full or half-empty, depending on the point of view. In the 30 November edition of "The Sunday Mail", Chinamasa said that the negotiators had prepared the text for this amendment, but that it still needed to be approved by the leaders on both sides.
New unilateral threats and MDC capitulation.
In remarks published in "The Herald" on 5 December, Mugabe told the ZANU-PF Politburo that "if the arrangement fails to work in the next one-and-a-half to two years", there would be an early election. On 13 December, the draft constitutional amendment was published in the government gazette. According to Motlanthe, the amendment marked a "major step towards the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe", and he expressed his hope that Tsvangirai would be sworn in immediately; it was believed that Mugabe was empowered to swear in Tsvangirai as Prime Minister without waiting for parliamentary approval of the amendment. Chamisa stressed that the outstanding issues of cabinet portfolios and provincial governors still needed to be resolved, while Chinamasa echoed Mugabe's earlier warning that he would call a new election if power-sharing was not successful.
On 19 December 2008, Mugabe claimed that the US was trying to get Southern African countries to oust him from power, but that his regional neighbours were "not brave enough". On 4 January, Mugabe fired 12 ministers and deputy ministers who had lost their seats in Parliament from the cabinet:
On 15 January 2009, Mugabe announced that he would hold talks with Tsvangirai again within a week. On 18 January 2009, Mugabe issued an ultimatum, calling on Tsvangirai to join the unity government or "break from it", refusing to concede on any points of contention.
After another SADC meeting on 26 January 2009, there were conflicting reports. The SADC and ZANU-PF claimed that it had been agreed that the Constitutional Amendment would be adopted on 5 February 2009 and the new government, including Tsvangirai, sworn in on 11 February 2009, while the MDC stated that there had been no agreement on key issues. However, on 29 January 2009 the MDC confirmed that it would join the inclusive government and that the MDC's national council would vote on the issue on 30 January 2009; it approved the deal. South African President Motlanthe pledged to assist Zimbabwe in the rebuilding process once the unity government was in place.
The news of the MDC's entry into government was followed by outbreaks of last-minute farm raids by war veterans, who feared that the coalition government would rein in the land reforms as a liberalising measure for the economy. On 5 February, both houses of parliament passed the unity government bill unanimously. Motlanthe expressed optimism on 8 February, saying that Mugabe and Tsvangirai "seem to be getting along fairly well".
On 10 February, the law creating a National Security Council, which would include Mugabe and Tsvangirai, was passed by Parliament. Tsvangirai designated the MDC's choices for Cabinet positions on the same day; these included Tendai Biti as Minister of Finance and Giles Mutseyekwa as Co-Minister of Home Affairs. Mugabe's ministerial appointees for ZANU-PF were subsequently announced; this list was dominated by members of the ZANU-PF old guard.
Tsvangirai and the deputy prime ministers were sworn in on 11 February 2009 as planned. On 13 February 2009, shortly before the planned swearing-in ceremony of the government, the MDC's nominee for deputy agriculture minister, Roy Bennett, was arrested at the Harare airport.
Aftermath.
In August 2013, following Tsvangrai's defeat in the Zimbabwean general election, 2013, Tsavngrai annonced that he and his party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) would no longer work with Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party, arguing that the elections were rigged and the election results were fraudulent. This would likely mean that Tsvangrai will resign as the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, and the breakage of the power sharing deal.

Don Baron Jayatilaka

Sir Don Baron Jayatilaka (Sinhala:ශ්‍රිමත් දොන් බාරොන් ජයතිලක) (13 February 1868 - 29 May 1944) (known as "D.B. Jayatilaka") was a Sri Lankan educationalist, statesmen and diplomat.

Euler's theorem (differential geometry)

In the mathematical field of differential geometry, Euler's theorem is a result on the curvature of curves on a surface. The theorem establishes the existence of principal curvatures and associated "principal directions" which give the directions in which the surface curves the most and the least. The theorem is named for Leonhard Euler who proved the theorem in .
More precisely, let "M" be a surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and "p" a point on "M". A normal plane through "p" is a plane passing through the point "p" containing the normal vector to "M". Through each (unit) tangent vector to "M" at "p", there passes a normal plane "P""X" which cuts out a curve in "M". That curve has a certain curvature κ"X" when regarded as a curve inside "P""X". Provided not all κ"X" are equal, there is some unit vector "X"1 for which "k"1 = κ"X"1 is as large as possible, and another unit vector "X"2 for which "k"2 = κ"X"2 is as small as possible. Euler's theorem asserts that "X"1 and "X"2 are perpendicular and that, moreover, if "X" is any vector making an angle θ with "X"1, then
The quantities "k"1 and "k"2 are called the principal curvatures, and "X"1 and "X"2 are the corresponding principal directions. Equation () is sometimes called Euler's equation .

<doc id="18753258" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18753258" title="Battle of Samarra (2004)">
Battle of Samarra (2004)

The Battle of Samarra, also called Operation Baton Rouge, took place in 2004 during the Iraq War. The city of Samarra in central Iraq had fallen under the control of insurgents shortly after insurgents had seized control of Fallujah and Ramadi. In preparation for an offensive to retake Fallujah, on October 1, 5,000 American and Iraqi troops assaulted Samarra and secured the city after three days of fighting.
Losing control.
During the month of September, negotiations with local commanders produced a city council which was to govern the city. However, insurgents soon seized control and the agreement fell apart. The city government was infiltrated by insurgents and the city came under the control of the Iraqi insurgency. Fighters loyal to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi roamed the streets, confiscating music cassette tapes, which were condemned as haram. Attacks on American and Iraqi forces in the vicinity of the city greatly increased. American commanders decided to re-take the city as a precursor to the upcoming battle to retake Fallujah.
Battle.
On the morning of October 1, the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion seized the Golden Mosque inside the city, capturing 25 insurgents and uncovering weapons caches. The Golden Mosque is considered the third-holiest shrine in Shia Islam, and any damage to it would have aroused significant controversy. Other Iraqi troops secured the Great Mosque of Samarra, a valued historic and cultural site.
That same day, Iraqi troops secured the main bridge across the Tigris River. American forces encountered insurgents transporting and unloading weapons using speedboats and opened fire, destroying the boats.
American and Iraqi forces were supported by M1 Abrams tanks, M2 Bradley armored fighting vehicles, one platoon of cannon artillery (155mm M109A6 Paladin howitzers) from the North Carolina Army National Guard, and the 1st ID 2nd BCT, primarily the 1-26th INF Task Force that was responsible for securing Samarra. Additional forces from 1-18th IN TF, 1-77th AR TF, and 1-4 Cav supported this operation. They focused on capturing major government and police buildings. After heavy street fighting, American and Iraqi forces controlled about half the city after the first day of fighting. CNN reporter Jane Arraf entered the city with US troops and covered the battle live. Fighting continued for two more days before the entire city was secured.
Around 90 weapons caches were captured during the course of the operation.
Aftermath.
After the battle, American forces began a program to provide security, build up the local police forces, and spent tens of millions of dollars on public works projects and hospitals. These initiatives brought some measure of security to the city, however, this did not prevent the bombing of the Golden Mosque in February 2006.

Jean-Baptiste Belley

Jean-Baptiste Belley (c. 1746 – 1805) was a native of Senegal and former slave from Saint-Domingue in the French West Indies who during the period of the French Revolution became a member of the National Convention and the Council of Five Hundred of France. He was also known as Mars.
Life.
Belley was said to have been born on 1 July 1746 or 1747 on the island of Gorée, Senegal, but the dates of his birth and death are uncertain. At the age of two, he was sold to slavers sailing for the French colony of Saint-Domingue. With his savings, he later bought his freedom.
In 1791, the enslaved Africans of Saint-Domingue began the Haitian Revolution, aimed at the overthrow of the colonial regime. As their fellow revolutionaries in France thought the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789, they began to see that slavery would need to be abolished.
In 1793, Bellay was a Captain of infantry, fought against the colonists of Saint-Domingue and was six times wounded. On 24 September 1793, he was one of three members ("deputés") elected to the French National Convention by the northern region of Saint-Domingue, together with Jean-Baptiste Mills, a mulatto, and Louis-Pierre Dufaÿ, a European, thus becoming the first black deputy to take a seat in the Convention. On 3 February 1794, he spoke in a debate in the Convention when it decided unanimously to abolish slavery.
However, the formal abolition of slavery did not disarm the European colonists' supporters, and although he was recognized as a full citizen of the Republic, Belley had to struggle against racist insinuations. He was an active spokesman for people of colour. When Benoît Gouly, a pro-slavery deputy from Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, called for special laws for the colonies, Belley denounced a pressure group of colonists meeting at the Hôtel Massiac in a speech published under the title "Le Bout d'oreille des colons, ou le système de l’Hôtel Massiac mis à jour par Gouly". He succeeded for a time in maintaining the Republican principle of equality between people in France and in its colonies, whatever their colour.
In a declaration of age and marital status for the representatives of Saint-Domingue in the Convention, Belley says that he was born at Gorée, is forty-eight years old, has never left the territory of the Republic, and has lived forty six years at Cap-Français. In a 'declaration of fortune' dated at Paris on 10 Vendémiaire, Year 4 of the Republic ("viz.", 1 October 1795), Belley declares that from the Republic he has only his 'emoluments', that he has bought no property, and that he owns only the contents of his room.
Belley remained as a Convention member until 1797, when he lost his seat. He returned to Saint-Domingue with Charles Leclerc's expedition of 1802 as an officer of gendarmes, but he was arrested, sent back to France and imprisoned in the fortress of Belle Île. He was still being held prisoner there in 1805 when he wrote to Isaac Louverture, the son of Toussaint Louverture. He died later the same year.
Portrait.
In about 1797, Belley's portrait was painted by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson (1767–1824), a former pupil of Jacques-Louis David, and was exhibited in Paris in 1798. In this painting, Girodet evokes the tensions of the period. Belley, standing, wears the uniform of a Convention member, with a tropical landscape behind him, and has a stylish relaxed pose, as favoured in many French political portraits of Revolutionary politicians. His elbow rests on a bust of the philosopher Guillaume-Thomas Raynal (1713–1796), author of "A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies" (1770). Raynal, who had just died, had been a supporter of the abolition of slavery.
Some modern critics have claimed that, in the age of European Neoclassicism (though Girodet was an early French Romantic painter), when depictions of the nude male form were modelled on and made explicit reference to the Classical (Ancient Greek and Roman) aesthetic ideal the prominence given in Girodet's portrait to displaying what is clearly a large penis in the sitter's breeches is a direct reinforcement and perpetuation of the Classical and since long-held notional correlation of savagery, animalistic tendencies and barbarity. Contemporary viewers of the portrait would have understood immediately the juxtaposition of elegany Western clothing on the body (and by corollary, the mind and spirit) of an individual from a race of people commonly viewed "by native population of the time" as uncivilised. The portrait therefore can more properly be seen also to reflect the then century-long held idea of the noble savage.
A drawing by Girodet for the portrait in ink and black chalk is in the Art Institute of Chicago, the restricted gift of the Joseph and Helen Regenstein Foundation, 1973. The portrait was used for the dust cover of C. A. Bayly's book "The Birth of the Modern World 1780–1914: Global Connections and Comparisons" (Oxford: Blackwell, 2004).

Jorge Eielson

Jorge Eduardo Eielson (April 13, 1924 – March 8, 2006) was a Peruvian artist and writer. As an artist he is known for his quipus, a reinterpretation of an ancient Andean device, they are considered precursors of conceptual art.
Eielson was born in Lima on April 13, 1924. His father died when he was seven years old so he was raised by his mother. At a young age he developed artistic tendencies: he played the piano, drew copiously and recited poetry. Eielson switched schools several times until at the end of his secondary education he met the anthropologist and writer José María Arguedas who introduced him to the artistic and literary circles of Lima as well as to the knowledge of the ancient civilizations of Peru. Eielson started studies at the National University of San Marcos in 1941. He won the National Poetry Award three years later and the National Drama Award in 1948, when he also held a successful art exhibition at the Lima Gallery .
In the same year, he traveled to Paris under a French government scholarship, in that city he exhibited at the Colette Allendy gallery before traveling to Switzerland thanks to a UNESCO scholarship. In 1951, he travels to Italy for a summer vacation and decides to settle permanently in Rome. During this period he wrote the collection of poems "Habitación en Roma" and two novels: "El cuerpo de Giulia-No" and "Primera muerte de María". In the late 1950s, he abandoned avant-garde and resorts to using materials such as earth, sand and clay to sculpt in the canvas surface; at first he uses this technique to depict landscapes but gradually moves towards human figures represented through clothing of various kinds. In 1963 he started his first quipu, reinventing this ancient Andean device with fabrics of brilliant colors, knotted and tied on canvas. Eielson's quipus were exhibited in the 1964 Venice Biennale to wide acclaim. In the mid 1970s, he traveled to Peru where he devoted himself to the study of pre-Columbian art; during this period, the "Instituto Nacional de Cultura" (National Institute of Culture) published most of his poetry under the title "Poesía escrita". He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1978 for a lecture in New York.

Anamaria Tămârjan (born May 8, 1991 in Constanţa) is a Romanian artistic gymnast. She is a bronze Olympic medalist and a gold European medalist with the team. Individually, she is a European silver medalist on balance beam and a bronze medalist on floor. Her favorite events are the floor and the balance beam.
Early life and career.
She is an identical twin; her sister Adriana was also a world-class gymnast and a member of the Romanian national team, but she is now retired. Tămârjan began training in gymnastics at the age of 4 in Ploieşti with coach Camelia Rădulescu. She moved to the junior national training center in Oneşti at the age of 12 and was invited to the Deva National Training Center a few years later.
During her junior career she competed at Siska Gym International (2006) where she tied for silver on floor with Ekaterina Kramarenko and placed seventh all around. She ranked sixth all around at the 2006 Romanian nationals. Although a member of the junior national team, she missed the 2006 European Championships with an elbow injury.
Senior career.
Tămârjan was a member of the Romanian team at the 2007 World Championships, but was replaced by alternate Andreea Grigore. She was training on the uneven bars before the competition and she slipped from the bar and broke her leg. She also missed the 2008 Romanian national championships with an injury. However, she had a good meet at the 2008 European Championships in Clermont-Ferrand, France, winning the gold medal with the team and the bronze medal on floor.
She was selected alongside Sandra Izbaşa, Steliana Nistor, Andreea Grigore, Andreea Acatrinei and Gabriela Drăgoi to be a member of the Romanian team at the 2008 Olympic Games. Here she helped her team to qualify in the fourth position in the team finals by competing on all four events vault (15.025) uneven bars (14.275), beam (15.200), and on floor (14.500).
In the team final event she supported the team to win the bronze medal by improving all the scores obtained in the preliminaries: vault (15.125) uneven bars (14.425), beam (15.425), and floor (14.950). She also placed 16th in the qualification for the all around but she did not compete in the finals due to the two per country rule.

Later that year she competed at the 2009 World Championships where she qualified only in the all around final. She ended her second world championships experience by placing ninth all around. After her return to Romania she underwent surgery to both knees with little chances of making a comeback at the 2010 European Championships. Due to health problems she retired in June 2010. She enrolled the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports in Bucharest.

Honda Elite

The Honda Elite is a series of scooters manufactured by Honda since 1983. Honda currently makes the 108cc 2010 Elite.
Elite 80.
In 1984 Honda released its first four-stroke modern scooter, the Elite 125. Later, Honda introduced the four-stroke Elite 80 (model code CH80) in 1985.
Production was moved from Japan to Mexico in 1991, and production ended in 2007. The Elite 80 had a 23 model year run with only minor changes.
Elite 125/150.
Honda released its first mid-sized four-stroke scooter onto the western market in the spring of 1984. The Elite 125 (CH125) continued Honda's trend of shifting from two-stroke engines to the much more emissions friendly four-stroke engine. The 1984 Elite featured many new technologies never before seen on a conventional scooter, such as a retractable headlamp, liquid cooled engine, a digital dashboard, and more.
For 1985, Honda brought back its mid-sized scooter along with some well thought modifications. Two of these changes were that the engine size was increased from 125 cc to 150 cc (thus changing the model name to the Elite 150) and that the Elite 150 was now being sold in two editions, the standard model, and a deluxe model. The deluxe model (CH150D) shared an almost identical body and frame as the Elite 125, including a digital instrument cluster and flip-up headlamp, while the standard model (CH150) got a more conventional pedicure, featuring an analog dashboard, and a fixed headlamp. 
1986 saw the elimination of the standard model Elite 150, leaving the Deluxe model as the only remaining mid-sized scooter Honda had to offer. Styling revisions for the Honda CH150 in 1987 included a transition from a boxy to a curvier, more rounded look. Although its appearance differed from its predecessor, the revised Elite 150 received few mechanical modifications. Despite the design changes the CH150 received in 1987, it was the last year this model was produced.
Elite E.
The 49cc Honda Elite E was launched in the late 1980s. The Elite E shares the fixed-ratio transmission with its cousin the Honda Spree, rather than the CVT of the standard Elite and Dio models.

Progressive Skatepark is a skatepark situated in Canton, Georgia, USA. It has support from the companies such as Fallen Footwear, Circa Footwear and Oakley, Inc..
History.
After months upon months of planning, Progressive Skatepark first opened its doors to the public on October 13, 2003. Progressive recently closed the summer of 2012.
Fallen Footwear put on one of the biggest displays to ever occur here, attracting nearly 1000 spectators. Professionals such as Chris Cole, Jamie Thomas and Billy Marks have all put on performances at the park. Companies such as Toy Machine, Element Skateboards, Zoo York, etnies, Osiris Shoes, Boost Mobile have supported the park. Skateboarders Andrew Reynolds, Nyjah Huston, Corey Duffel, Paul Rodriguez Jr., Jereme Rogers, Tosh Townend, and Chad Muska have all made appearances at the park.
Course.
Progressive Skatepark is a , indoor, climate controlled, free standing (no beams) facility with an adjoining outdoor skate/bmx course.
The indoor course measures in at . The course was designed by mastermind Joel Mealing with one thing in mind: flow. 
Outside you will find another skate and bmx course. This course features a wood street course, a five foot skatelite bowl and a concrete flat section with real concrete ledges. Total skate area is . The main course has a capacity of 125 skaters and the outside can handle another 75 skaters. Also located inside the main building is Georgia’s largest Core Skateboard Shop. The shop is .
Competitions.
Progressive Skatepark has partnered with 3rd Lair Skatepark in Golden Valley, Minnesota to host the "King of The Groms Competition". Having participated in the event annually since 2005, King of The Groms offers a competition purely designed for skateboarders at or under the age of 12. The winners, along with receiving prizes, also are presented with an invitation to the finals at 3rd Lair. The final winner in the competition (1st place expert street) wins a professional sponsorship with the skateboard company "World Industries".
In 2008, Progressive Skatepark hosted the King of the Park Contest presented by Oakley and Red Bull. This competition is open to amateurs across the world and follows a completely unique format. Rather than adhere to conventional "skate then pick finalists formats", King of the Park uses an elimination method similar to that of the NCAA Tournaments: head to head skating, double elimination brackets.

Nightmare Revisited

Nightmare Revisited is a cover album of songs from the 1993 film "The Nightmare Before Christmas". It was released on September 30, 2008 by Walt Disney Records to commemorate the film's 15th anniversary of its release. In addition to the album's eighteen covers are two re-recordings by original composer Danny Elfman, of the "Opening" and "Closing" tracks. One song featured on the album, Marilyn Manson's "This Is Halloween", was previously released nearly two years earlier, on the reissue of "The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" which, featuring five covers of songs from the film, acted as a precursor to "Nightmare Revisited". The album also features Korn covering "Kidnap the Sandy Claws". Enhanced content on the disc features the trailer of "The Nightmare Before Christmas", as well.
American psychobilly band Tiger Army also provided a cover of "Oogie Boogie's Song", which was not featured on "Nightmare Revisited", but did see release as a digital bonus track. Scott Murphy's cover of "Sally's Song" is also featured on Japanese pressings of the album.
Promotion.
On September 27, 2008, three days before the release of "Nightmare Revisited", the album was made available for streaming exclusively by "Spin.com".
On September 22, 2008, Evanescence vocalist Amy Lee, who contributed a cover of "Sally's Song" for the album, announced that she would be performing her cover on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" on October 13, 2008. Marilyn Manson similarly performed his cover of "This Is Halloween" (from the reissue of "The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack") on "The Tonight Show" on Halloween two years earlier (October 31, 2006).

William Robert Campbell

Sir William Robert Campbell was the first British colonial Inspector General of Police of Ceylon (Sri Lanka). After serving as chief of police in the Indian province of Rathnageri, he was appointed as Chief Superintendent of Police in Ceylon to be in charge of the Police Force on September 3, 1866. Therefore, the 3rd of September 1866 is considered as the beginning of Sri Lanka Police Service. The post was changed to Inspector General of Police in 1867.

IPFW Mastodons

The IPFW Mastodons, sometimes called the Fort Wayne Mastodons, are the athletic teams of Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne. The Mastodons compete as an National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I school in the The Summit League for most sports and in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association for men's volleyball. The university participates in 16 men’s and women’s sports. Before joining NCAA Division I athletics, IPFW competed in the Great Lakes Valley Conference in the NCAA Division II.
Athletics.
IPFW sponsors seven men's and eight women's teams in NCAA sanctioned sports:
Men's Teams
Women's Teams
Varsity Sports.
Men's Basketball.
Before joining NCAA Division I athletics, IPFW competed in the Great Lakes Valley Conference in some sports in the NCAA Division II, where in 1993, the men’s basketball team led by brothers Sean and Shane Gibson achieved the ranking of #4 in the country in NCAA Division II competition. Dane Fife was named the IPFW men’s basketball head coach during summer 2005. Fife, who left after the 2010-11 season, was the youngest NCAA Division I head coach at the time of his appointment, at the age of 26. Tony Jasick is currently the head coach.
Men's Volleyball.
IPFW’s men’s volleyball team, colloquially known as the "Volleydons," have gained national exposure repeatedly, based on their showings in several NCAA Final Four tournaments. Men’s Volleyball Head Coach Arnie Ball, who has led the Volleydons for 30 years, began the 2009–10 school year with more than 460 wins as an NCAA Division I coach. His teams have made six NCAA Final Four appearances, finishing fourth in 1992 and 1994, third in 1991, 1999, and 2006, and second in 2007. Ball is the father of Lloy, a one-time Volleydon, who has achieved Olympic success, having served as the U.S. Olympic volleyball team captain in 1996, 2000, and 2004 and becoming a gold medalist in 2008. Fundraising for the $1 million Arnie Ball Legacy Endowment Fund was completed by January 2010. The university will match this amount. IPFW has become the first American university to establish a men's volleyball program whose scholarships are fully funded from an endowment.
Club Sports.
Men's Ice Hockey.
The IPFW Club Men's Ice Hockey Team is in its 6 season as a program and competes in the ACHA's North Region. IPFW has had recent success finishing in the top 20 in the nation the last 3 seasons. This past season the Dons' won the Big Ten Tournament championship hosted by Northwestern University. This was a huge win for the program with bigger schools such as Iowa, Nebraska, Northwestern, Northern Illinois and #3 ranked University of Michigan-Flint also in the tournament. The Dons' play their home games at Lutheran Health SportCenter and have for the past 2 seasons. IPFW used to play their games at the old McMillan Ice Arena. For further information please visit IPFWHockey.com.
Venues.
IPFW has no football team. Although IPFW has no arena or stadium of its own, the venue for IPFW's large-attendance indoor athletic events is the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum which is adjacent to the portion of the IPFW campus on the west side of the Saint Joseph River. For example, IPFW hosted the 2000 NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship matches at the Coliseum. Smaller athletic events are held at the Hilliard Gates Sports Center on the IPFW campus. The IPFW men's ice hockey team plays its games at the Lutheran Health SportsCenter located off campus.
Mascot and Monikers.
In 1968 a large bone was discovered during the installation of a farm pond near Angola, Indiana, about 40 miles (65 km) north of Fort Wayne. The farmer contacted professors in the IPFW geology department, who identified his discovery as the leg bone of a mastodon. Faculty and students from the geology department excavated the greater part of an adult mastodon, including the skull and tusks. The bones were cleaned, preserved, and placed on permanent display at IPFW. In 1970 members of the geology club, led by professors who oversaw the excavation, successfully lobbied the student government committee charged with choosing a name for the university mascot to select the mastodon. And thus, the IPFW Mastodons were born . In addition to serving as a mascot, “mastodon” is used as the athletic moniker for team members and school-spirited references to the student body. The selection of the mastodon as mascot—as well as a tongue-in-cheek borrowing of the term “don” from its academic British English use—lends itself to be a suffix to refer to the athletics teams as well, such as Volleydons for the volleyball teams. In a related reference, the Mastodon STOMP pep band instills school spirit among the fans during home matches and games.

Examination boards in the United Kingdom

Examination boards in the United Kingdom (now more often called awarding bodies or "awarding organisations") are the examination boards responsible for setting and awarding secondary education level qualifications, such as GCSEs, Standard Grades, A Levels, Highers and vocational qualifications, to students in the United Kingdom.
Grades that can be awarded are the following: 
All grades indicate a pass with the exception of a U grade at GCSE and Fail at BTEC. Most courses at GCSE come in Higher (A*-D) and Lower (C-G) tiers.
Until the mid-1990s, academic exam boards and vocational accreditors were run very much as separate organisations. In more recent times, this distinction has been removed, with all the term 'awarding bodies' now being used. This article focuses on the contemporary and historical awarding bodies that set academic exams in state schools. In everyday terminology, these organisations are still referred to as 'exam boards'.
Broadly speaking, the UK has always had two separate school systems: one for England, Wales and Northern Ireland; and one for Scotland. As a result, two separate sets of exam boards have been developed.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Unusually, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have several exam boards, with schools and colleges able to freely choose between them on a subject-by-subject basis. Currently, there are seven exam boards available to state schools:
Though the exam boards have regional roots (see below), they are all nationwide, though the CCEA is not very active outside of its native Northern Ireland. Most offer a range of qualifications, though not all boards offer every qualification in every area (Edexcel, for example, offers a great deal of vocational qualifications, while the WJEC is the only board to offer A Level Film Studies). In particular, the ICAAE is very specialised, offering only a small number of business-related GCSEs and is far and away the smallest Ofqual-approved exam board for state schools. CIE is another exception: it is traditionally an international exam board, but now offers the Cambridge Pre-U and Cambridge International Certificate to state schools.
Schools and colleges have a completely free choice between the boards, depending on the qualification offered. Most schools use a mixture of boards for their GCSE qualifications, with a similar situation existing at A Level. (It is worth noting that a school using, say, OCR for GCSE History is perfectly free to pick a different board for A Level History.)
History.
Early beginnings.
Exam boards have been around as long as there have been qualifications offered by schools. As universities had experience of offering qualifications, such as degrees, it was natural that they created the first exam boards. Indeed, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge each had their own exam board and a joint board they ran together. The qualifications offered were generally of the boards' own creation. Schools and colleges (with some exceptions, detailed below) were free to pick which board they wanted to use, though most went for a local board.
The early boards established included:
The Central Welsh Board differed from most exam boards, as it was not controlled by a university and only offered examinations to schools and colleges in Wales. Intermediate schools in Wales had to use the Board, though other schools and colleges were free to choose.
The University of Birmingham disbanded its own exam board and joined the JMB in 1916.
School Certificate and Higher School Certificate.
In 1918, the first national qualifications for England, Wales and Northern Ireland were introduced: the School Certificate, taken at 16, and the Higher School Certificate, taken at 18. The existing exam boards started offering the new qualifications, normally in place of their own qualifications.
In 1930, the University of London Extension Board renamed itself the University of London Matriculation and School
Examinations Council before becoming University of London University Entrance and School Examinations Council and School Examinations Department in 1951.
The University of Durham Matriculation and School Examination Board renamed itself the Durham University Examinations Board in the 1930s.
The Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) was founded by the Welsh local authorities in 1948. It took over many of the Central Welsh Board's responsibilities, including running Wales's exam system.
GCE (O Level and A Level).
In 1951, the General Certificate of Education (GCE) was introduced. It was split into two stages: Ordinary Level (O Level, taken at 16) and Advanced Level (A Level, taken at 18). These qualifications replaced the School Certificate and the Higher School Certificate respectively.
The existing exam boards offered the GCE, alongside the Northern Ireland Schools Examination Council
These boards were soon joined by the Associated Examining Board (AEB), which was founded by City & Guilds in 1953.
The Southern Universities' Joint Board for School Examinations was founded in 1954 as a successor to the University of Bristol School Examinations Council.
The Durham University Examinations Board ceased to exist in 1964.
The University of London University Entrance and School Examinations Council and School Examinations Department was renamed the University of London School Examinations Board in 1984.
CSE.
In 1965, the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) was introduced. It was aimed at the 80% 16-year-old students who did not take O Levels and, until that point, had left school with no qualifications. CSEs were administered on a local basis with local boards offering the qualifications. The local boards in England were new organisations, while in Wales and Northern Ireland (where universities did not control the existing boards), the existing boards were used. The CSE boards were:
In 1979, the neighbouring Metropolitan and Middlesex boards merged to form the London Regional Examinations Board. The West Yorkshire and Lindsey and Yorkshire and Humberside Boards also merged to form the Yorkshire Regional Examinations Board in 1982.
GCSE.
To create a more egalitarian system, the O Levels and CSE (but not the A Level) were replaced by the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in 1986. As O Levels and CSEs had used different exam boards (except in Wales and Northern Ireland), new 'examining groups' were created. In England, the four examining groups were consortia of regional GCE and CSE exam boards, while in Wales and Northern Ireland they were the existing boards, making six boards in total:
As CSEs were no longer offered, the CSE boards effectively ceased to operate as independent boards and instead became part of their larger examining groups (some were even taken over by larger members of their groups, such as the South East Regional Examinations Board, which was acquired by the Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations in 1985). The GCE boards, however, retained a degree of autonomy, as they still offered A Levels independently.
Though the boards were regional, schools were entirely free to pick which board they did their GCSE qualifications with and could mix and match between subjects.
When the Certificate of Achievement (now the Entry Level Certificate, a qualification below GCSE level) was introduced, the GCSE examining groups were responsible for administering the qualification.
Creation of the current boards.
It was not long before the GCE (A Level) boards and GCSE examining groups began to formally merge or enter into even closer working relationships. This made sense, as the it allowed merged boards to offer both GCSE and A Level qualifications and the boards were working together to offer the GCSE qualifications anyway. Many boards also took the opportunity to merge with vocational exam boards, as vocational qualifications became more common in schools. The government encouraged this, as they wanted to simplify the system by having fewer exam boards.
AQA.
The Joint Matriculation Board merged with the Northern Examining Association in 1992 to form the Northern Examinations and Assessment Board (NEAB). Meanwhile, the Associated Examining Board merged with the Southern Examining Group to form AEB/SEG 1994, though both kept their respective identities. In 1995, the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) was abolished, with its GCSE functions being transferred to AEB/SEG (its A Level functions went to UCLES). NEAB, AEB/SEG and the vocational City & Guilds formed the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA) in 1997, with the AEB/SEG and NEAB formally merging into AQA in 2000 (City & Guilds chose to remain independent, but closely cooperates with AQA). AQA is run as an educational charity.
OCR and CIE.
The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES) took over the Southern Universities' Joint Board in 1990 and the Midland Examining Group (MEG) in 1993. When the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) was abolished in 1995, its A Level functions were transferred to UCLES (its GCSE functions went to AEB/SEG). In the same year, UCLES also took over the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board (OCSEB). UCLES then merged all its A Level boards together together to form the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations and Assessment Council (OCEAC). This left UCLES offering A Levels under the OCSEB name, GCSEs under the MEG name and some vocational qualifications under the UODLE name. This situation continued until 1998, when UCLES took over the vocational Royal Society of Arts Examinations Board. Following the merger, it chose to use the name Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR) for all its UK qualifications. OCR is now the only major exam board owned by a university and is still run by the University of Cambridge, through its Cambridge Assessment division.
Cambridge Assessment also controls CIE, a predominately international exam board that started offering some qualifications to English, Welsh and Northern Irish state schools in 2008.
Edexcel.
The University of London School Examinations Board merged with the London and East Anglian Group to form the University of London Examinations & Assessment Council (known as London Examinations or ULEAC) in 1991. In 1996, London Examinations merged with the vocational BTEC to form the Edexcel Foundation (the legal entity called London Qualifications). Though it originally ran as an educational charity like AQA, the Foundation was taken over by Pearson in 2003 (and renamed simply Edexcel), making it the only British exam board to be run by a profit-making company.
CCEA and ICAAE.
The Northern Ireland Schools Examination Council became the Northern Ireland School Examinations and Assessment Council before being replaced by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) in 1994. It is a non-departmental public body.
ICAAE was founded in 1989. It specialises in a small number of business and ICT courses. It began offering GCSEs in 1997, in partnership with CCEA. Since 2009, it has offered exams independently of CCEA. ICAAE is a division of ICAA.
WJEC.
Unlike the other boards, WJEC did not experience any major organisational changes and is still owned by the Welsh local authorities, though it operates independently.
Scotland.
There is just one exam board in Scotland, the SQA (Scottish Qualifications Authority), which offers all Scotland's qualifications.
History.
Previously, academic qualifications were awarded by the Scottish Examination Board, while vocational qualifications were awarded by the Scottish Vocational Education Council (SCOTVEC).
Examination boards working together.
The UK's examination boards sometimes work together. For example, they sometimes offer qualifications jointly or share training materials for common parts of specifications.
The JCQ (Joint Council for Qualifications) is a common voice for UK exam boards. The JCQ is made up of AQA, CCEA, City & Guilds, Edexcel, OCR, SQA and WJEC. Among its roles, it devises standard rules for exams and publishes statistics.

Jérôme Rota (Saint-Jean-de-Védas, 1973) is a French software developer. He also known by the name Gej.
In 1999, while he was working as a graphic designer and a technical director in an advertising agency in France, he made the "DivX ;-)" 3.11 Alpha video codec (the smiley was a part of the name) by hacking the Microsoft MPEG-4v3 codec (which was actually not MPEG-4 compliant) from Windows Media Tools 4 codecs. His hack had the advantage of supporting the AVI formatted files. Initial peer-to-peer rapid spread of the program turned into its introductions to the markets. As a result, a company was established.
The new project was first given the name ProjectMayo, and an open-source MPEG-4 codec called OpenDivX was made. It was later changed into a proprietary, closed-source product and the name was changed to DivX (dropping the smiley from the original MSMPEG-4 hack). Rota joined the company DivX, Inc. (formerly known as DivXNetworks, Inc.), based in San Diego, in 2000. The company employed up to 300 employees by February 2007.

Carlisle United were another side who earned a second successive promotion, only two years after a relegation from the League that some predicted would see the end of the club. Northampton Town joined them, making up for two seasons of play-off disappointment, and Leyton Orient ended a decade in the bottom division by earning promotion on nearly the last minute of the season. Wycombe started the season with a 21 game unbeaten run that saw 5 of their players named in the PFA LG2 team of the year. Two tragic off the fields events however saw them fall away in the second part of the season before losing to Cheltenham Town in the playoff semi-finals. Grimsby Town lost 1-0 to Cheltenham in the final at the Millennium Stadium.
Rushden and Diamonds failed to improve on the previous season, and paid the price with relegation to the Conference. Oxford United joined them, despite the return of manager Jim Smith, and became the first former winners of a major trophy to be relegated to the Conference.

The George Gund Foundation

The George Gund Foundation was established in 1952 and provides grants in the areas of education, human services, economic and community development, the environment and the arts. The Foundation has made grants totaling more than $538 million since its inception.
History.
The George Gund Foundation was created in 1952 because George Gund considered the private foundation to be the most positive, farsighted vehicle for intelligent underwriting of creative solutions to social ills. Grantmaking until George Gund's death in 1966 primarily reflected his personal commitment to institutions that had been important in his life. 
The Foundation's assets grew considerably following George Gund's death in 1966, and the Foundation hired its first staff in 1969. At that time, the Foundation began to develop priorities and guidelines that reflected not only George Gund's interests but also new areas of commitment.
Today, George Gund’s vision is carried forth through the continued involvement of the Gund family. His son, Geoffrey, is currently president of the board which now includes both second and third generation family members.
Mission.
The George Gund Foundation was established in 1952 as a private, nonprofit institution with the sole purpose of contributing to human well-being and the progress of society.
Grantmaking.
The George Gund Foundation's long-standing interests include: Arts, Economic Development and Community Revitalization, Education, Environment, and Human Services. The Foundation's focus is centered in Greater Cleveland, though a portion of the Foundation's grantmaking supports state and national policy making that bolsters its work locally.

Schild's ladder

In the theory of general relativity, and differential geometry more generally, Schild's ladder is a first-order method for "approximating" parallel transport of a vector along a curve using only affinely parametrized geodesics. The method is named for Alfred Schild, who introduced the method during lectures at Princeton University.
Construction.
The idea is to identify a tangent vector "x" at a point formula_1 with a geodesic segment of unit length formula_2, and to construct an approximate parallelogram with approximately parallel sides formula_2 and formula_4 as an approximation of the Levi-Civita parallelogramoid; the new segment formula_4 thus corresponds to an approximately parallel translated tangent vector at formula_6
Formally, consider a curve γ through a point "A"0 in a Riemannian manifold "M", and let "x" be a tangent vector at "A"0. Then "x" can be identified with a geodesic segment "A"0"X"0 via the exponential map. This geodesic σ satisfies
The steps of the Schild's ladder construction are:
Approximation.
This is a discrete approximation of the continuous process of parallel transport. If the ambient space is flat, this is exactly parallel transport, and the steps define parallelograms, which agree with the Levi-Civita parallelogramoid.
In a curved space, the error is given by holonomy around the triangle formula_10 which is equal to the integral of the curvature over the interior of the triangle, by the Ambrose-Singer theorem; this is a form of Green's theorem (integral around a curve related to integral over interior).

The Salt Lick

The Salt Lick is a barbecue restaurant in Driftwood, Texas, US.
History.
The Salt Lick was opened in 1967 by Thurman Roberts, Sr. and his wife Hisako T. Roberts. It quickly grew in popularity and went from being open just a few times a year to seven days a week. Roberts and Hisako built the Salt Lick restaurant on the ranch where he was born, using locally-quarried limestone. Hisako's Hawaiian heritage inspired the sweet barbecue sauce used in the restaurant.
The Salt Lick's primary cuisine is beef (brisket), sausage, and pork ribs. Chicken and turkey are also served. Merchandise available from the restaurant or by mail order includes t-shirts, koozies and hats, as well as the restaurant's trademark meats, sauces and dry rub. The Salt Lick is currently owned by Scott Roberts and his wife Susan.
Facilities.
In addition to the main restaurant, the Salt Lick provides banquet facilities and has a pavilion for larger groups, set on the bank of Onion Creek. Parts of the mansion that Thurman Roberts built overlooking the main restaurant are used for parties, weddings, and also house the business's main offices. Salt Lick Cellars, which sells locally made wine and Texas beers, is located on the same property as the restaurant.
Salt Lick branch restaurants also operate in the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, DFW Airport, Oklahoma City and in Round Rock, Texas.
Notoriety.
In late 2008 The Salt Lick was featured during an Austin episode in the first season of the Travel Channel's show "Man v. Food" (hosted by Adam Richman), and the restaurant was positively reviewed by Food Network chefs Bobby Flay and Duff Goldman. Then in 2012 it was featured on another Travel Channel show, "Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America", for its spicy brisket jalapeño sandwich topped with habanero sauce (which was recommended to Richman by Flay).

World Youth International

World Youth International is a non-government, non-religious, non-political, not-for-profit organisation. WYI was founded by the late Robert Hoey in 1988. Its HQ is in Adelaide, Australia. The focus is on creating opportunities for people to live life passionately and contribute to the global community; enhancing quality of life, strengthening communities and reducing poverty through sustainable development projects. 
The website is www.worldyouth.org.au [http://www.worldyouth.org.au/]
The organisation has organised volunteering opportunities for more than 3,000 Australians of all ages, working in some of the world's poorest communities. At the heart of WYI's mission is a commitment to community-led, sustainable development projects.
History.
Robert Hoey, a young man from Adelaide, Australia, founded the organisation at the age of 21. In 1988, after spending several years working with teenage programs and organisations, Robert saw a need to provide young Australians with an opportunity to become involved in a program offering support and the opportunity to travel overseas. From participating in these projects, Robert felt sure that these young people would gain numerous skills and knowledge not easily developed elsewhere.
Robert's ability to act as a spokesperson and role model for young people was noticed by an American youth organisation called Global Discovery. They invited him to accompany them to Russia for three months to work on rehabilitation programs with young people affected by the Chernobyl disaster. Upon his return to Australia, Robert founded World Youth International.
One of the first projects the newly formed WYI engaged in was a fundraising activity to financially support 15 Russian teenagers in coming to Australia for a three month cultural exchange program. As a result, forty Aussie teenagers raised over $24,000 by gaining sponsorship to ride their pushbikes between Melbourne and Sydney and Sydney to Melbourne. Bike rides were then held in subsequent years all across the country.
A few years later, having travelled, studied and led programs around the world, Robert was leading a teenage exchange program in the USA and became gravely ill. He had contracted a form of Cryptococcus Meningitis, but knew he wanted to be flown home. His mother and sister both flew to the USA to be with him, but Robert never made it back to Australia and passed away on the plane.
Led by Robert's mother and father, Ann and Ralph Hoey, with the support of the Hoey family, the organisation has committed to continuing Robert's vision and with the support of hundreds of volunteers have since built a school and children's home in Nepal; children's homes and a 50 bed hospital in Western Kenya; established sponsorship programs for over 300 orphans and school students; as well as overseen thousands of volunteers who have participated in WYI's development projects across the world.
WYI's financial accountability.
As a signatory to the Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) code of conduct, WYI complies with ACFID reporting requirements. As a registered non-profit charitable organisation they have all financial records audited every twelve months. They receive no government funding and rely solely on volunteers and the generosity of people all across the world. Any 'profit' made at the end of each year goes back into funding community development and major projects overseas. 
The World Youth International Benevolent Trust was established in 2002. The organisation is the Trustee of the Trust, and is responsible for maintaining the fund and assuring that all funds received are used for the principal purpose being: "to provide aid for the relief of people suffering poverty, distress, misfortune and helplessness in countries declared by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as developing countries." A Management Committee for the Trust directs the Trustee in the management and operations of the Trust. 
International partnerships.
The WYI Head Office is based in Adelaide, South Australia, but WYI affiliates in Kenya and Nepal are governed independently and are accountable to the government's of Kenya and Nepal. In Cambodia, WYI partners with the local NGO 'This Life Cambodia' in supporting their grassroots education projects. Field offices are also set up in other countries.
Funding.
WYI receives the majority of its funds through private sources, including donation and gifts from individuals, child sponsorship, fundraising events, overseas program activities, contributions and education fund. A small amount comes from investment income. They do not receive grants from any Australian or overseas sources.

Western Australian state election, 1914

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 21 October 1914 to elect 50 members to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. The Labor party, led by Premier John Scaddan, retained government against the opposition conservative Liberal Party led by Opposition Leader Frank Wilson, though with only the barest of majorities. The election also saw the emergence of the Western Australian Country Party, which had been formed at a conference of the Farmers and Settlers Association the previous year to fight for rural interests, and won eight seats at the election. 
The fragility of the Labor Party's majority was demonstrated when, a year later, Labor member Joseph Gardiner's seat was declared vacant on account of his non-attendance and a Liberal was elected in his stead, and Labor became a minority government when on 18 December 1915, Edward Johnston resigned from the Labor Party and became an independent. On 27 July 1916, the Scaddan Ministry was defeated and Wilson became the new Premier.
Results.

Ancient Coin Collectors Guild was founded in 2004 as an advocacy group for private collectors of ancient coins. The ACCG is a 501(c)4 non-profit organization chartered in the American state of Missouri.
Mission.
According to its bylaws, the purpose of the Ancient Coin Collectors Guild is to promote and nurture the free and independent collecting of coins from antiquity. This is undertaken by volunteers through education, political action, and consumer protection. The goal of the ACCG is to foster an environment in which the general public is able to confidently and legally acquire and hold, for personal or professional use, any numismatic item of historical interest regardless of date or place of origin.
Governance.
The ACCG is governed by an elected board of seven Directors. Daily business of the guild is managed by an Executive Director. The guild has no paid employees. Membership categories range from Friend to Benefactor with varying levels of contribution distinguishing the membership level. The ACCG is an umbrella organization for 20 Affiliate Member organizations boasting a total membership of nearly 6,000 collectors.
Activities.
Activities of the ACCG have mainly been directed toward legislative or governmental agency lobbying and educational programs related to cultural property management or youth programs. For example, the ACCG opposes any changes to the Memorandum of Understanding that the State Department's Cultural Property Advisory Committee has with Italy, that would mean ancient coins no longer have unrestricted entry into the United States.
2010 federal lawsuit.
In July 2010, the ACCG filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The lawsuit sought to recover 23 ancient coins that the ACCG had ordered from a coin dealer in London and which were seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Baltimore on April 24, 2009. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit on August 8, 2011, and the ACCG may file an appeal.

Gedaliah son of Pashhur is a man described in the Book of Jeremiah of the Hebrew Bible, Judaism's Tanakh, and Christianity's Old Testament. He is described as one of the political opponents of Jeremiah, one of those who appealed to King Zedekiah to have Jeremiah executed because of his prophecies that Jerusalem and the Temple would be destroyed by the Babylonians due to the wickedness of the Jews:
In August 2008, the Israeli archelologist Eilat Mazar announced the discovery of a bulla, a lump of clay bearing a seal impression, inscribed with the name Gedaliah ben Pashur, in the excavations of the Ir David Foundation in the City of David, just south of Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Mazar noted that the just-discovered bulla was found just yards from the spot where, three years ago, another bulla was found with a name from the above verse, viz. Yehukual ben Shelemyahu (Jucal the son of Shelemiah).

Anthony Rey

Anthony Rey (born at Lyon, France, 19 March 1807; died near Ceralvo, Mexico, 19 January 1847) was a French Jesuit academic, and U.S. Army chaplain during the Mexican–American War.
Life.
He studied at the Jesuit college of Fribourg, entered the novitiate, 12 November 1827, and subsequently taught at Fribourg and Sion in Valais. In 1840 he was sent to the United States, appointed professor of philosophy in Georgetown College, and in 1843 transferred to St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He became assistant to the Jesuit provincial of Maryland, pastor of Trinity Church, Georgetown, and vice-president of the college (1845). 
Appointed a chaplain in the U.S. Army in 1846, he ministered to the wounded and dying at the siege of Monterrey; after the capture of the city, he remained with the army at Monterrey and preached to the "rancheros" of the neighbourhood. Against the advice of the U.S. officers, he set out for Matamoros, preaching to a congregation of Americans and Mexicans at Ceralvo.

<doc id="18754396" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18754396" title="IDHEAP">
IDHEAP

The Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration (French: "Institut des hautes études en administration publique", IDHEAP) is a Swiss graduate school of public administration. The independent foundation was integrated into the University of Lausanne on 1 January 2014.
The school teaches graduate and post-graduate courses for public sector executives and (more recently) students wishing to take up public service. It also provides professional training for members of administrative bodies. It receives support from the Swiss Confederation under the Swiss Federal Law on University Funding. IDHEAP is located on the campus of the University of Lausanne.
Beyond its teaching activities, IDHEAP also carries out research and counselling missions regarding the public sector. IDHEAP has been designated as the leading institution of the Swiss Public Administration Network, which aims to foster cooperation between the universities of Bern, Lausanne and Lugano, to boost research works and doctoral studies in public administration.
History.
IDHEAP was created (under the form of a “Foundation for a graduate school in public administration”) by Enrico Bignami, former delegate of the Board of Directors of Nestlé and creator of IMEDE (now the International Institute for Management Development), who wished to establish a Swiss MBA for the public sector. The other founders were the canton of Vaud, the University of Lausanne, the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the Association of Friends of IDHEAP.
Accreditation.
The institute is accredited by the Swiss Confederation (via OAQ), and the MPA is accredited by the European Association for Public Administration Accreditation.
Programmes.
The programmes of the IDHEAP include:
MPA programme.
The MPA program is a 90 ECTS executive, flexible length and multidisciplinary program, designed for public sector managers or would-be managers. It is also open to anyone wishing to pursue a career in an organization whose activities involve working with the public sector.
The curriculum includes a foundation course (6 core modules of 6 days –one day a week during the academic year), 3 course options of 12 days, chosen among a list of 18 elective courses and an approximately 100 pages thesis covering an original and in-depth research project carried out from an interdisciplinary perspective and supervised by a professor at IDHEAP and an external expert.
Teaching includes group works (both presential and online), simulations, case studies (which may require students to work on real mandates and counselling missions carried out by the Institute) and research works.
The IDHEAP courses are delivered in French (although an international Executive MPA will soon be offered in English). The two other working languages are German and English. Both a student's trimester’s work and the dissertation can be written in French, German, English or Italian.
The average age of a graduate is 37, with a 66/34 split of men/women. 80 percent of graduates already have a university degree, most of them in political sciences, arts, economics, and law.
Research.
The IDHEAP teaching and research units participate in research projects financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation and R&D financed by the Commission for Technology and Innovation or the European Union four-year Information Society Technologies framework programs. Some research receives support from programs such as the Swiss Virtual Campus, the Interreg fund (European Cross-border Cooperation) or COST – European Cooperation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research. Part of the research work carried out at IDHEAP is financed by consulting or experts’ fees.
33 research projects are currently under way at the school. Recent examples include:
IDHEAP publishes a full list of research projects on its website, at http://www.idheap.ch/idheap.nsf/vwBaseDocuments/IdREx01?OpenDocument&lng=en.
Five new research projects were awarded to IDHEAP in 2007 by the Swiss National Fund for Research. In 2007, three doctorates of Public Administration were awarded by the University of Lausanne on the recommendation of IDHEAP.
Also in 2007, the university's Prof. Giuliano Bonoli was awarded the Latsis prize by the Swiss National Research Fund for his comparative research works on social policies.
Mandates and counselling missions.
IDHEAP carried out 40 mandates in 2007: these were benchmarking missions, fusion of small towns and administrations, fiscal optimization, efficiency evaluations, organizational audit, satisfaction surveys, marketing audit, and organizational reengineering. Among the main clients, were the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Swiss Parliament, the Swiss Conference of Universities, the Swiss Federal Office of Culture, the Swiss Federal Office for Migration, the Swiss Federal Office of Social Insurance, the Swiss Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology, the Swiss states of Bern, Fribourg, Neuchâtel, Valais, Vaud, the cities of Berne, Geneva, Lausanne, and Neuchâtel, The Institute for Research and Debate on Governance, The Lausanne Olympic Capital association and BEDAG SA.

1936 Chatham Cup

The 1936 Chatham Cup was the 14th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds.
Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Auckland Thistle, Waterside (Wellington), Western (Christchurch), and Maori Hill (Dunedin).
The 1936 final.
The final was the first in which two separate players (Bill White and Fred Angus) both scored two goals. One of White's goals was the first penalty to be scored from in a final. White scored first from the spot after just 12 minutes, and doubled his tally quarter of an hour later. Angus reduced the deficit to one before the break, and it was only through having a second strike disallowed that the Aucklanders were still behind at the interval. Injury to L. Williamson reduced Thistle to ten men for the majority of the second half (this being in the days before substitutes were allowed). Angus managed to score an equaliser for the northerners, however, but the scores were only to remain level briefly, with Geoff Ellis adding a third for Western. Williamson limped back on for the last few minutes, and though Thistle applied the pressure, Western held on to the lead.
1937 Chatham Cup.
There was no competition in 1937. 
Several factors were taken into consideration in the decision to suspend the competition, of which two were significant. A visit by the England amateur side and a major South African rugby tour led to a conflict of possible competition dates, which would have made the organisation and scheduling of matches difficult. The NZFA had also decided that the final should be held in the South Island for the first time; this led to a substantial reduction in the number of contestants, with only twelve teams confirming their entries by the close-off date, none of which were from Auckland. 
In truth, the competition had been struggling for several years with the difficulty of arranging dates for matches. Given the entirely amateur nature of the competition, matches were played solely at weekends, and therefore any Chatham Cup matches ate into the available time for local league competitions. There is some indication that not everyone involved in the organization of regional football was entirely unhappy with the suspension of the competition, though many were, and the remit to suspend it was greeted, according to one contemporary report with "a mixture of apathy and hostility by clubs and followers of the game."
Teams who had expressed their willingness to take part in the 1937 competition were: Pukemiro, Wellington Marist, Seatoun, Petone, Scottish Wanderers, Western, Nomads, Christchurch Thistle, Millerton All Blacks, Runanga, Northern, and Invercargill Thistle. A provisional entry from Hamilton Wanderers was also received, but this was later withdrawn.

Arcadio Maxilom

General Arcadio Maxilom y Molero (November 13, 1862–August 10, 1924) was a Filipino teacher and hero of the Philippine Revolution.
He was born in Tuburan, Cebu to Roberto Maxilom, the town "gobernadorcillo", and Gregoria Molero. His family were members of the local gentry, or "principalía". He worked as a teacher in the local school before joining the Katipunan, whose activities in Cebu were led by a young Negrense, León Kilat.
After Kilat's betrayal and assassination, Maxilom continued the revolution in Cebu. Under his command, the Katipunan was able to regroup in the central highlands, which Spanish forces found impenetrable. On December 16, 1898, Maxilom wrote a letter to the Spanish authorities in Cebu, demanding that the latter surrender. Weary after incessant fighting, the Spaniards quickly responded, asking Maxilom for two to three days to leave the province. By Christmas Eve, the Spaniards have left, leaving behind only three Catholic clerics.
Little did the Cebuanos, indeed, all Filipinos, know that their newfound liberty would be short-lived, Spain having already been forced to sell the fate of their former subjects to the United States for twenty million dollars (see Treaty of Paris).
Maxilom is best remembered for stubbornly refusing to surrender to the American occupying forces even as his fellow revolutionaries in Manila and Cebu were starting to capitulate or collaborate with the new colonial power. He finally surrendered on October 27, 1901.
Virtually forgotten after the revolution, Maxilom died in his hometown of Tuburan, after a long bout with paralysis, on August 10, 1924. His funeral cortège, joined in by leading revolutionary figures including Emilio Aguinaldo, stretched some four kilometers, in what remains to this day the longest in Cebu's history.
Mango Avenue, one of Cebu City's main thoroughfares, was renamed Maxilom Avenue in honor of the general.

Stéphane Belmondo

Stephane Belmondo (born Hyères, Var, July 8, 1967) is a French jazz trumpeter, flugelhornist and drummer. Including recordings made with his brother Lionel Belmondo and Yusef Lateef, he won the best French album category "(L'Album français de l'année)" in 2003, 2004 and 2005, and the best artist award "(L'Artiste ou la Formation instrumentale française de l'année)" in 2003 and 2004. in the French "Victoires du Jazz" awards. Along with his brother he is noted for tribute albums that involve the musicians being honored.
Biography.
The Belmondo family say music came naturally to Stephane, before he could even speak. His father, Yvan, was proud of his son, but inflexible when it came down to his musical education. As a former professional saxophonist, he understood the necessity of discipline and practicing music requires. He was able to instill these values into his son from an early age and Belmondo quickly adopted these principles. He first started with drums and percussion instruments at the age of 6, accordion at 8, then he chose to take up the trumpet at ten years old. Belmondo studied accordion and cornet at the Aix-en-Provence Conservatory of Music, before being admitted to the trumpet class of the Marseille Conservatory at 16. Belmondo was 14 when he finally took the stage with his accordion joining the big band led by his father and brother Lionel who played saxophone. When he and his brother started a quintet, Belmondo was 15 years old.
By 1986, Belmondo had already won his first prize for trumpet in Marseille. When he arrived Paris to pursue his career, he met pianist René Urtreger, who gave him many opportunities to share the stage, notably with famed double-bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. He also worked with Pierre Michelot and Al Levitt which were among many others.
In 1987, shortly after his arrival in Paris, he joined Laurent Cugny’s big band, "Lumière". Cugny had convinced arranger Gil Evans to come to France and work on the orchestra’s repertoire. The collaboration resulted in two albums "Rhythm-A-Ning" and a European tour where Belmondo also recorded and performed with.
From 1987 to 1990, he played with pianist Kirk Lightsey’s quartet and bassist Pierre Boussaguet’s quintet, which his brother and Jacky Terrasson was also featured. Working with Boussaguet led to the release of an album called "Jazz aux Remparts" featuring one of Belmondo's idols, the American trumpeter Tom Harrell.
Belmondo joined Michel Legrand’s big orchestra and took part in 1992 concert at the Olympia where Legrand and Stéphane Grappelli appeared together for the first time. In 1992 he participated in the album "Legrand/Grappelli" with Legrand and Grapelli. He toured with them around the world.
In 1994 Belmondo played in Dee Dee Bridgewater's trio and recorded an album, "Love and Peace" with them in 1995, which featured Jimmy Smith.
In the same year Belmondo moved to New York City. He continued touring with Dee Dee Bridgewater in the US, including shows at the Newport Festival and the Carnegie Hall. During his stay in New York, he played with many musicians, including Al Foster, Mark Turner, Lew Tabackin, Donald Brown and Franck Amsallem. He recorded with pianist Donald Brown and his quartet performed at the Blue Note. 
In 2002, in celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of Chet Baker’s death, Belmondo performed with Jean-Louis Rassinfosse and Philip Catherine, two of Baker’s former partners.
Returning to Paris, he recorded his first solo album "Wonderland" in 2004, interpreting a collection of Stevie Wonder songs. This album won Belmondo two "Victoires du Jazz" awards in France, in 2005.
Belmondo met the saxophone and flute player Yusef Lateef and they together made an album called "Influence" (2005). Shortly after this, his group, including Yusef Lateef, toured Europe and around the world until 2008.
In 2008 Belmondo recorded with the great Brazilian singer, Milton Nascimento and they toured together.
Belmondo was also part of the development of new bugle and trumpet models which are marketed under the name “Concept TT” by the instrument maker Selmer.

<doc id="18754517" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18754517" title="Wolf Blitzer">
Wolf Blitzer

Wolf Isaac Blitzer (born March 22, 1948) is a journalist and television news anchor, who has been a CNN reporter since 1990. He is the host of "The Situation Room" and the dayside show called "Wolf". Blitzer also serves as the network's lead political anchor.
Early life.
Blitzer was born in Augsburg, Germany, the son of Cesia Blitzer (née Zylberfuden), a homemaker, and David Blitzer, a home builder. His parents were Jewish refugees from Poland, and Holocaust survivors. He was raised in Buffalo, New York. Blitzer was graduated from Kenmore West Senior High School and received a Bachelor of Arts in history from the University at Buffalo in 1970. While there, he was a brother of Alpha Epsilon Pi. In 1972, he received a Master of Arts in international relations from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. While at Johns Hopkins, Blitzer studied abroad at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he learned Hebrew.
Name.
Blitzer has said that he has frequently been asked about his name, which has been characterized as seemingly "made-for-TV".
Blitzer explains that his surname goes back for generations, and his first name, 'Wolf', is the same first name as his maternal grandfather.
In writing for several Israeli newspapers in Washington, Blitzer has used the names Zev Blitzer and Zev Barak. Zev (זאב) is the Hebrew word for "wolf" and Barak (ברק) is the Hebrew word for "lightning" (which in German/Yiddish is Blitz).
Career.
Washington and Jerusalem.
Blitzer began his career in journalism in the early 1970s in the Tel Aviv bureau of the Reuters news agency. In 1973 he caught the eye of "Jerusalem Post" editor Ari Rath, who hired Blitzer as a Washington correspondent for the English language Israeli newspaper. Blitzer remained with the "Jerusalem Post" until 1990, covering both American politics and developments in the Middle East.
In the mid-1970s, Blitzer also contributed to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) as the editor of their monthly publication, the "Near East Report". While at AIPAC, Blitzer's writing focused on Middle East affairs as they relate to United States foreign policy.
At an April 1977 White House press conference, Blitzer asked Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat why Egyptian scholars, athletes and journalists were not permitted to visit Israel. Sadat, somewhat taken aback, responded that such visits would be possible after an end to the state of belligerence between the two nations. This was Sadat's first public acknowledgment that peace between Egypt and Israel was possible. In November of that year, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel, and Blitzer covered the negotiations between the two countries from the first joint Israeli-Egyptian press conference in 1977 to the final negotiations that would lead to the signing of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty two years later.
Fluent in Hebrew, in this period Blitzer also published articles for several Israeli-based newspapers. Under the name Zev Blitzer, he wrote for "Al HaMishmar"; using the name Zev Barak, he had work published in "Yedioth Ahronoth".
In 1985, Blitzer published his first book, "Between Washington and Jerusalem: A Reporter's Notebook" (Oxford University Press, 1985). The text outlined his personal development as a reporter, and the relations between the United States and Israel.
Jonathan Pollard.
In 1986, he became known for his coverage of the arrest and trial of Jonathan Pollard, an American Jew who was charged with spying for Israel. Blitzer was the first journalist to interview Pollard, and he would later write a book about the Pollard Affair titled "Territory of Lies". In the book, Blitzer writes that Pollard contacted him because he had been reading Blitzer's byline for years, and because Blitzer "had apparently impressed him as someone who was sympathetic". Pollard also hoped that Blitzer would help him "reach the people of Israel, as well as the American Jewish community."
Blitzer's interview with Pollard was controversial in the context of the legal action against him, as it was construed by some media voices as a possible violation of the terms of Pollard's plea deal, which forbade media contact. Blitzer's subsequent book about the affair was included in "The New York Times" list of "Notable Books of the Year" for 1989. In its review, the "Times" praised the book as "lucid and highly readable" and called Blitzer's judgment of Israeli officials "harsh but fair".
A review in "The New York Review of Books" was more critical, prompting a letter from Blitzer accusing the reviewer of making several inaccurate statements. Reviewer Robert I. Friedman responded to Blitzer's criticism by characterizing "Territory of Lies" as "a slick piece of damage control that would make [Blitzer's] former employers at AIPAC (not to mention Israel's Defense Ministry) proud."
CNN.
In May 1990, Blitzer moved to CNN and worked as the cable network's military affairs reporter. Blitzer spent a month in Moscow in 1991, and was one of the first Western reporters to visit KGB headquarters. His team's coverage of the first Gulf War in Kuwait won a CableACE Award and made him a household name.
In 1992, Blitzer became CNN's White House correspondent, a position he would hold until 1999. During this period, he earned an Emmy Award for his coverage of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. In 1998, he began hosting the CNN Sunday morning interview program "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer", which was seen in over 180 countries. Blitzer's first assignment as an anchor was on the daily newscast "The World Today", in 1999. In 2000, he started anchoring his own show, "Wolf Blitzer Reports."
CNN selected Blitzer to anchor their coverage of the 2004 presidential election, the 2008 presidential election and the 2012 presidential election. Since August 8, 2005, Blitzer has hosted "The Situation Room", a two-hour afternoon/early evening program on CNN.
In 2013, he started anchoring the 1pm ET hour of "CNN Newsroom", until 2014, when the slot was renamed as "Wolf".
Awards.
Blitzer has won awards including the 2004 Journalist Pillar of Justice Award from the Respect for Law Alliance and the 2003 Daniel Pearl Award from the Chicago Press Veterans Association. His news team was among those awarded a George Foster Peabody Award for coverage of Hurricane Katrina, an Alfred I. DuPont Award for coverage of the 1999 Southeast Asian tsunami, and an Edward R. Murrow Award for CNN's coverage of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
In November 2002, he won the American Veteran Awards' Ernie Pyle Journalism Award for military reporting. In February 2000, he received the Anti-Defamation League’s Hubert H. Humphrey First Amendment Freedoms Prize. In 1999, Blitzer won the International Platform Association's Lowell Thomas Broadcast Journalism Award. Blitzer won an Emmy Award for his coverage of the Oklahoma City bombing. Blitzer was also part of the CNN team that was awarded a Golden ACE award for their 1991 Gulf War reporting. In 1994, "American Journalism Review" cited him and CNN as the readers' choice for the Best in the Business Award for network coverage of the Clinton administration. On May 20, 2007, Blitzer was awarded the honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by the George Washington University at their undergraduate commencement exercise. On May 23, 2010, Blitzer was awarded the honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by Niagara University at their undergraduate commencement exercise. Also, on May 14, 2011 he received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Penn State University. On September 25, 2011, Blitzer was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by the University of Hartford.
Other media appearances.
Blitzer appears as himself in the 2009 documentary "." The film deals with the back room negotiations that led to the historic 1979 Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt. At the time, Blitzer was the Washington Bureau Chief of the Jerusalem Post, and played a key role in establishing a back channel of communications between Israel and the White House by introducing President Carter's General Counsel, Robert Lipshutz, to New York businessman Leon Charney, a close friend of then Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman. The flow of information between Weizman and Carter, via Charney and Lipshutz, contributed to finalizing the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.
On September 17, 2009, Blitzer competed on an episode of "Celebrity Jeopardy!", finishing the Double Jeopardy round with −$4,600. He was given $1,000 to bet in Final Jeopardy!, finishing with $2,000 and ultimately losing to comedian Andy Richter, who won $68,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

1938 Chatham Cup

The 1938 Chatham Cup became the 15th nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand, after a two-year gap caused by the lack of a 1937 Chatham Cup competition (see 1936 Chatham Cup for explanation).
The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds.
Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Ponsonby, Waterside (Wellington), Hamilton Wanderers, Nomads (Christchurch), and Mosgiel.
The 1938 final.
The final was played in soggy conditions to which Mosgiel found it difficult to adapt. Despite playing with the breeze in the first half, the southerners were 1-0 down after just six minutes through a goal from Sonny Ward. Shortly after the half-time break Tom Walker doubled the lead, and a third was added by Toby Janes at the hour mark after a pass from Ward. Walker completed the scoring with a tap-in late on in the second half.

Rattachism

Rattachism (, also "Réunionisme") is a movement within Francophone Belgium that advocates for the unification of the region of Wallonia (optionally including Brussels and six Flemish municipalities with language facilities for French-speakers) with France.
The main rattachist political parties are the Walloon Rally (partially) and the Wallonia-France Rally. They still have not gained any parliament seats so far.
History.
The movement for Belgian or Walloon union with France has existed since Belgium was created.
The Southern Netherlands were invaded and annexed by the First French Republic in 1795, ending Habsburg rule. After Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815, the major victorious powers agreed at the Congress of Vienna on reuniting the former Austrian Netherlands and the former Dutch Republic, creating the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was to serve as a buffer state against any future French invasions. King William imposed Dutch as the main language, while French was the language of the bourgeoisie in the Southern Netherlands. They were also significantly underrepresented in the Dutch Assembly. These and other reasons caused in 1830 the Belgian Revolution, supported by France. The Southern Netherlands declared independence, becoming the Kingdom of Belgium. However, a lot of the proponents of secession from the Netherlands, preferred union with France rather than an independent country, but the major European powers decided on an independent neutral Belgium in the Treaty of London.
Term "Rattachism".
The "r" in "rattachism" (from "re-" and "attach"), indicating a re-unification, is in reference to a future unification being a repeat occurrence, after the previous "unity" which transpired during the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic empire.

George Hooper

George Hooper (18 November 1640 – 6 September 1727) was a learned and influential English High church cleric of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. He served as bishop of the Welsh diocese, St Asaph, and later for the diocese of Bath and Wells, as well as chaplain to members of the royal family.
Early life.
George Hooper was born at Grimley in Worcestershire, 18 November 1640. His father, also George Hooper, appears to have been a gentleman of independent means; his mother, Joan Hooper, was daughter of Edmund Giles, gentleman, of White Ladies Aston, Worcestershire. From Grimley his parents moved to Westminster. He was elected a scholar of St Paul's School while John Langley was high-master (1640–1657), but then was transferred to Westminster School under Richard Busby, who thought him very promising, and obtained a king’s scholarship there. 
Hooper as elected to a Westminster studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1657: he graduated BA 16 January 1660, MA 1 December 1663, BD 9 July 1673, and DD 3 July 1677. He remained at Oxford as college tutor until 1672, and made the acquaintance of Thomas Ken. Under Dr. Edward Pococke he became a good Hebrew and Syriac scholar, but also learned enough Arabic to apply it to Old Testament exegesis.
Clergyman.
In 1673 Bishop Morley persuaded Hooper to come and reside with him as his chaplain at Winchester. Ken was the bishop’s chaplain at the same time. In the same year Morley presented Hooper to the living of Havant, where he seems to have gone into residence at once, and contracted an ague from the dampness of the place. Ken, then incumbent at East Woodhay in Hampshire, then resigned the living to make way for his friend. Hooper was instituted at Woodhay in 1672. Isaac Milles, the exemplary parish priest of the neighbouring village of High Clere, frequently mentioned Hooper as "the one of all clergymen whom he had ever known in whom the three characters of perfect gentleman, thorough scholar, and venerable divine met in the most complete accordance."
Archbishop Sheldon induced Morley to permit Hooper to move to Lambeth Palace to become his own chaplain in 1673. In 1675 he was collated by Sheldon to the rectory of Lambeth, and soon afterwards to the precentorship of Exeter. Morley sent for Hooper to attend him in his last sickness in 1684. 
Royal chaplain.
On the marriage of the Princess Mary with the Prince of Orange, Hooper went with her to Holland in 1677 as her almoner at the Hague. Here he had a difficult post to fill, since Prince's views inclined to the Dutch Presbyterians, and the Princess's former chaplain, Dr. William Lloyd, had allowed her to give up the Anglican services. Hooper persuaded her to read in Hooker and Eusebius, and argued with the Prince, to the point of William saying "Well, Dr. Hooper, you will never be a bishop." His daughter, Mrs. Prowse, however, reported that "in this station he was directed to regulate the Performance of Divine Chappel in Her Highness’s Chappel, according to the usage of the Church of England, which he did in so prudent and decent a manner as to give no offence."
After about a year at The Hague, Hooper returned home to marry, then afterwards he returned to the Hague for eight months, when he was succeeded by Ken. In 1680 he was made chaplain to Charles II, and in the same year the Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford, vacant by the death of Richard Allestree, was offered to him: he declined it. In 1685 he was asked by James II to attend the Duke of Monmouth the evening before his execution, and on the following morning was on the scaffold with the Bishops of Ely and Bath and Wells and Dr. Tenison.
At the Williamite Revolution he was one of the few decidedly High churchmen who took the oaths. In 1691, on the promotion of Dean Sharp to the archbishopric of York, Queen Mary offered him the deanery of Canterbury, taking advantage of the king’s absence to promote her favourite: William, on his return, expressed displeasure at her conduct. In 1698 the Princess Anne and her husband Prince George of Denmark wanted Hooper as tutor to the young Duke of Gloucester, but the king imposed Gilbert Burnet.
In 1701 Hooper was elected prolocutor to the lower house of the convocation of Canterbury, and defended its privileges of the lower house. About the same time he declined an offer of the primacy of Ireland made by the Earl of Rochester, as lord-lieutenant. 
Bishop.
Towards the close of 1702 he accepted the bishopric of St. Asaph. In 1703 the see of Bath and Wells fell vacant through the death of Richard Kidder. Queen Anne offered Hooper, but he felt that his non-juring friend Ken was the proper bishop of Bath and Wells. After negotiations, Hooper to filled the vacancy. Ken ceased signing himself "T. Bath and Wells", and dedicated his "Hymnarium" to Hooper. The queen ordered a pension of £200 a year to be paid to Ken.
Hooper was happy in the see of Bath and Wells, and refused translation, and a seat on the privy council. He was a frequent preacher before royalty. In the "church in danger" debate in the House of Lords in 1705 he maintained that the danger was not, as some supposed, imaginary; in 1706 he spoke against the union between England and Scotland, and advocated in the cause of the Scottish Episcopal church. In 1709-10 he defended Henry Sacheverell, and entered his protest against the vote in favour of his impeachment.
Burnet, who had personal differences with Hooper in Convocation, describes him in 1701 in his "History of His Own Time" as "reserved, crafty, and ambitious". Other detractors of Hooper were Jacobites and nonjurors who were angry with Ken for resigning his canonical claims to Bath and Wells. Francis Atterbury also calle him ambitious; William Whiston, whom Hooper had rejected from holy communion, expressed a high opinion of his character.
Family and later life.
Hooper married in 1678, a lady, Abigail Guildford, to whom he had been engaged before he left England for the Hague. He died, aged nearly eighty-seven, on 6 September 1727, at Barkley, near Frome, a secluded spot in his diocese to which he was wont to retire at intervals to recruit his strength. He survived his wife one year; and out of a family of nine children only one was living at the time of his death, the wife of John Prowse of Axbridge, who was author of an unpublished life of her father. Hooper was buried in Wells Cathedral, and a marble monument was erected to his memory.

Farley Sinkins was born in 1845, in Leeds the son of a school master William Sinkins and his wife Susannah. From an early age he showed great promise in singing and he was a musical child. His parents enrolled him in Leeds Parish Church Choir where he remained until his voice broke.
Career.
His career started in around 1865 when he was appointed bass to St Asaph Cathedral in Wales. In 1870 he moved to Oxford where he became the principal bass in Christchurch Cathedral where he also taught music and was a lay clerk.
In 1877 he left Oxford to take up the position of lay vicar in Exeter Cathedral in Devon where he stayed until January 1891. He resigned after being admonished for unauthorised absence, doubtless due to appearing in one of his now frequent concerts. His married life started to collapse and he began on a series of affairs with various professional singers. This did nothing for his career and the concerts quickly fell apart leaving him a desolute man who died in 1929, in the Chelmsford area.

Huis Honselaarsdijk

Huis Honselaarsdijk (English: "House Honselaar's Dike") was a mansion in Honselersdijk, Holland, Dutch Republic. It was designed by the Dutch architects Bartholomeus van Bassen, Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post, and was built in the first half of the 17th century as a "buitenplaats" for stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. 
Various popular artists were commissioned to decorate the house, and paintings or sculptures were created specifically for Honselaarsdijk by Wybrand de Geest, Gerard van Honthorst, Pieter de Grebber, Paulus Bor, Christiaen van Couwenbergh, Cornelis Vroom, and Artus Quellinus, among others. Extensive formal gardens in the French manner overseen by André Mollet were laid out on either side of a central allée.
To this house in November 1677 arrived the newly-married Stadtholder William and Princess Mary before their state entry into The Hague. After the death of king-stadtholder William, the palace came into the hands of the king of Prussia. Frederick the Great sold the mansion in 1754 to Anna van Hannover. It was neglected and in 1815 its main building was demolished.
De Nederhof, the "Lower Courtyard", one of two symmetrical buildings flanking the main block and used as stabling and guest quarters, still remains and is now a home for people with disabilities.

Maureen Fleming (born on a United States Navy base near Yokohama, Japan, circa 1954) is an American dancer, performance artist, and choreographer from New York City. She studied butoh dance and is known for her meditative, dreamlike solo dances, which include elements of contortion, and in which she often performs unclothed (sometimes with her body painted white). "The New Yorker" magazine has called her "perhaps the foremost American practitioner of Butoh."[http://www.maureenfleming.com/pages/reviews_pages/20040412_newyorker.html
Early life.
She was born in Japan, the daughter of a United States Navy lieutenantwho was part of the Occupation of Japan, and grew up in Yokohama.[http://www.maureenfleming.com/pages/reviews_pages/20020301_bostonherald.html She was injured in an automobile accident at the age of two, following which she lost the disc between her fourth and fifth vertebrae. Only learning of this accident many years later, she believes this experience to have shaped her career in dance, particularly her affinity for moving her body in a slow, deliberate fashion. She moved with her parents to the United States when she was three years old, and began dancing at approximately age seven.

Diving in Thailand

Scuba diving in Thailand is very popular. Thailand has some reefs and a number of shipwrecks. The number of divers coming to Thailand continues to increase year after year .
The under sea visibility in some places of Thailand is up to 30 metres with coral gardens, undersea rock formations, hard and soft corals, whale sharks, silvertip sharks, manta rays and shipwrecks. In reality, visibility is often less depending on a number of unpredictable factors such as winds, tides, currents, runoff from rain, proximity to cities, water temperature, underwater activities and more.
History.
Diving began in Thailand in 1962 . The Thailand Sub Aqua Club was founded by two Thais and an Englishman who had just arrived . The club was very active and the Minister of Tourism became their patron . The first ever professional dive centre was opened in Pattaya in 1975 by which time the sport had become well established and the Thailand Sun Aqua Club had its own premises in Pattaya . Shortly after the popularity of diving for both Thais and foreigners in Thailand increased .
After Pattaya, the next destination to see divers was Phuket and they were soon heading out to dive in the Similan Islands and the rest of the Andaman Sea . The Similan islands have been ranked as one of the top ten diving sites in the world. Today, diving is popular all over the Andaman Sea, including Tarutao and the Surin islands.
Over on the other side of Thailand in the Gulf of Thailand, Ko Tao (Turtle Island) has recently emerged as the biggest diving destination in Thailand with over twenty major centres located on the island.
Diving in Thailand statistics.
Statistics show that over 200,000 dive tourists visit Thailand a year.
From 1999 to 2003 the Similans attained a fivefold increase in the number of visitors, which was just 10,000 increased to 50,000 and most of them were divers. The income grew in that time from 12,000USD to a staggering 500,000USD with foreign divers each spending an average of roughly 1,200USD.
Diving destinations and diving sites in Thailand.
The Andaman Sea.
Introduction: The visibility in the Andaman ranges from 4–50 m and the underwater scenery is scattered with extensive coral reefs. Due to the influence of the southwest monsoon, most of the reefs surrounding the offshore islands occur on the east side of the islands.
List of Destinations
Phuket.
Phuket Island has some decent dive sites and the largest diving centre in Thailand. The reefs around the area are in a healthy condition with both solid and colourfully soft corals. There is also an abundance of marine life. Most of the dive locations are suitable for all abilities of divers but there are also some that are quite deep.
The most well-known dive site in the Phuket area is Racha Yai with its sloping rocky reefs and its plentiful solid coral forests. There is also Ter Bay where there is an exciting wreck in the depths of 15–25 metres. The area south Racha Yai, Racha Noi, is a heaven for experienced divers as the depths are greater and the currents stronger. The overall topography is strikingly different from Racha Yai with huge granite boulders and the chance to see manta rays and whale sharks.
Just off Phuket is the limestone island of Koh Doc Mai which soars vertically from the seabed. It is home to a diversity of fish and offers the opportunity to view leopard sharks, moray eels, octopus and turtles.
Koh Phi Phi (Phi Phi Island)
You might already have heard about Phi Phi Island - a tropical island between Krabi and Phuket, Thailand / Asia . Almost every island in the world claims to be one of the most beautiful - a tropical island in paradise. Phi Phi is no exception! And judging by the return visitors we have – some have been coming here regularly for over 10 years – there seems to be some truth in the claim.
Since the Tsunami of December 4 the island has made an excellent recovery by now the only noticeable physical change to a newcomer is a reduction in available accommodation. The atmosphere is more laid back than before with local people really appreciating the business tourism brings supporting their recovery
Luckily Phi Phis reefs escaped the Tsunami virtually unscathed meaning phi phi is still by far the most convenient location for divers who would like to explore the Andaman sea with a majority of dive sites not more than 40 minutes from the hotels.
20th Century Fox chose Phi Phi as the location for shooting Leonardo DiCaprio's film "The Beach".
Krabi Province.
Krabi Province has the largest range of dive sites available in Thailand, offering beautiful diving and snorkelling with plenty of succulent soft coral, limestone outcrops and an enormous diversity of marine life. Although the region was struck badly by the 2004 Tsunami disaster, the area has recovered impressively and divers are coming back in flocks.
The main diving bases for the many sites in the Krabi area are Ao Nang and Railay beaches on the Krabi mainland, Phuket's Chalong Bay and the islands of Phi Phi and Ko Lanta. Ao Nang beach has the highest concentration of dive centres and accommodation, as it has access to all the sites at Phi Phi, Shark Point marine sanctuary, and also a group of 30 small island dive sites in Ao Nang Bay, with limited access to Hin Daeng and Hin Muang, the Ko Haa Islands.
Phi Phi Island attracts a younger crowd of revellers but offers easier access to the dive sites around its shores. The island has two remarkable limestone crops divided by a narrow flat isthmus and it is there where most of the visitors stay. Ko Phi Phi has an abundance of succulent coral and colorful schools of fish.
Shark Point Marine Sanctuary, which lies directly between Krabi, Phi Phi and Phuket, is a popular group of 3 dive sites which are usually all dived together in a single trip. The King Cruiser wreck is the remains of an 85 metre long twin hulled passenger ship which sank in 2000 after running aground on an anemone reef. The anemone reef itself is a unique dive site with a massive limestone pinnacle soaring 30 metres from the seabed to just 1 metre beneath the surface. The site is well known for its abundance of sea anemones that cling to every surface while attracting enormous schools of fish. Different types of fish to be seen include schooling reef fish, trevally, snappers, groupers and colorful clown fish, along with larger game-fish like tuna and barracuda as well as the occasional leopard shark.
The third site is the site which gives the group its name of Shark Point. This is a reef that comprises three pinnacles, the largest of which breaks the surface appearing as a barren rock outcropping. The reef is home to an abundance of colorful soft corals and vibrant sea fans that decorate the limestone pinnacles, giving home to many morays, sea horses, schooling reef fish and larger pelagics.
Ko Lanta.
In the south of Krabi is Ko Lanta, with many dive shops in and around the main tourist areas of Saladan Town, Klong Dao beach, Klong Nin beach and Kantiang Bay. It is the closest point in Krabi to some of the best dive sites in Thailand (frequently ranked in the top ten in the world); the underwater pinnacles of Hin Daeng and Hin Muang, and the Ko Haa group of Islets. Although some of these sites are reserved for the more experienced diver, with strong currents, the deepest wall dive in Thailand, and large underwater caverns to explore, the rewards are tangible with frequent visits by whale sharks and manta rays, an enormous variety of fringing reefs, as well as pelagic and reef fishes. For the beginner level diver, Koh Haa offers calm conditions, unparalleled visibility and an abundance of marine life.
Ko Lipe.
South of Ko Lanta, in the southernmost part of the Andaman Sea, you will find Ko Lipe, a small island which is on the border of the Tarutao National Marine Park. Largely unknown on the Thailand tourist circuit, Ko Lipe is surrounded by dozens of uninhabited islands featuring some of the best diving in the Andaman Sea. The dive sites here are notable for their incredible colors, in particular the soft coral gardens of the most popular dive sites, Ko Sawang and Stonehenge.
The diving here is generally shallow, easy and relaxed, making it a great place to learn to dive, minus the crowds of the more well known dive scenes in Thailand. For experienced divers looking for some excitement, there are a few sites which are generally more challenging to dive, namely 8 Mile Rock and the Yong Hua Wreck. At these sites it is not uncommon to spot mantas and whale sharks along with schools of trevally, barracuda and giant groupers.
Visibility is highly variable here during the high season but tends to be best at the start and end (October - November and April - May).
There are eight dive centres scattered around the island, which is small enough to get around on foot. Most sites are reached via boat rides ranging from 5 minutes to an hour.
Similan Islands.
Located in Pha-nga province, 50 km west of Khao Lak, the Similan Islands have several of Thailand’s most famous diving sites and can lay claim to having one of the best diving sites in Asia. The Similans consist of 9 islands (Similan means 9 in Malay language) Ko Bon, Ko Bayu, Ko Similan, Ko Payu, Ko Miang (two adjoining islands), Ko Payan, Ko Payang, and Ko Huyong. The islands are famed for their thriving reefs and abundance of delicate coral and variety of exciting marine life. It is possible to see chevron barracuda, giant trevally, manta rays, leopard sharks and rainbow runners.
Of all the islands, one of the most popular with divers is Ko Bon. This island has a sheer wall 35 metres deep which is followed by a stepped ridge descending to 45 metres. Located roughly 25 km north of here, but not actually part of the Similans, is Ko Tachai with its lush tropical foliage and underwater ridge which juts out at 90 degrees. Divers may experience the opportunity to encounter leopard sharks, nurse sharks or whale sharks. Uncontrolled fishing activities along the entire coast brought all shark species close to extinction, shark sightings by scuba divers have dropped massively since 2008. The South-East Asia coral bleaching event in summer 2010 has had a huge impact on the Similan dive sites, since November 2012 coral recovery can be witnessed. 
Other popular diving sites in Similans include:
Stonehenge: This is a large towering rock formation with a variety of marine life. Divers can spot barrel sponges, lionfish, gorgonian sea fans, barracuda, wrasse, ghost pipefish and long nose butterfly fish.
Snapper Alley: This site is popular for night dives. Its solid healthy table and sheet provides marine life places to hide and sleep.
Sharkfin Reef: This is a dive site for experienced divers. It is possible to spot clown trigger fish, half-moon trigger fish, bat fish and surgeon fish. - closed by the National Park since Nov 2010
Elephant Head Rock: This rock is simply a massive boulder and is ideal for experienced and daring divers. Silver trevally, jet black trevally, small reef sharks, hawksbill turtle, lionfish, grouper and snappers can all be seen.
East of Eden: Here is the most spectacular bommie in the Similans and the violet and blue corals can be seen - was closed by the National Park between Nov 2010 and 15th February 2013
Donald Duck Bay: This rock was named after the cartoon character it resembles and it is another great site for marine life where one can also see crabs, octopus and cuttlefish running across the sea bed. Due to damage by boat anchors as well as heavy boat traffic most dive operators do not consider this as a dive site anymore.
West of Eden: Jumbled granite boulder gardens, numerous sea fans and soft corals. Lots of small canyons and crevices. West of Eden is the dive site less affected by the 2010 coral bleaching and is now considered as one of the best dive sites in the Similan National Park.
Christmas Point: Intermediate to advanced dive site. Different from other granite boulder dive-sites, in that the rocks appear to be more eroded, forming interesting and unique shapes. Can be barren in spots, however, worthwhile to watch for coral gardens, leopard sharks, ribbon eels. 
Surin Islands.
The Surin Islands are virtually untouched with pristine virgin reefs that slope to the seabed. The islands are situated 80 km west of Ranong province along the west coast of Thailand.
Located near the Surin islands is the horseshoe shaped Richelieu Rock. The sheer diversity of marine life contains schooling chevron barracuda, numerous types of moray eels, abundant lionfish and scorpion fish and five types of anemone fish, juvenile emperor angel fish, sea horses, ornate ghost pipefish, harlequin shrimps and even whale sharks, manta rays and shovelnose rays.
Khao Lak.
Khao Lak Marine National Park a palm fringed coastline with newly discovered reefs. The area is home to a plethora of marine life and several wrecks. The nearby Similan and Surin Islands are easily reached via day trip speed boats and liveaboards - there is also freshwater diving at Khao Sok National Park Khao Sok. Local diving features more muck diving and features some rare and endemic species - most notable are Hypselodoris Hypselodoris and Janola Nudibranchs.
Mergui Archipelago.
This brand new diving area just south of Burma has only been opened to the public since 1997. The area is still relatively unknown and with many unexplored islets and dive sites, the Mergui Archipelago offers the opportunity for divers to visit new dive areas.
The representation of coral is in some places extremely abundant, with large gardens of soft coral fields in a dominant colour like bright orange. A lot of islets and islands are built up of limestone, and their underwater terrains are cracked with caves and holes. Due to its limestone reefs with its rough texture, underwater walls are often scattered with colourful sponge walls.
Dive sites are deeper and currents are stronger at Burma's dive sites than at the nearby Similan Islands in Thailand. Diving at the Mergui Archipelago is particularly recommended to divers with an advanced diver level, as circumstances for beginners can be really tough.
Fish schools are more common at the dive sites of the Similan Islands, Koh Bon, Koh Tachai and Richelieu Rock, whereas in the Mergui Archipelago extreme bigger fish and at the other hand, macro life like many species of nudibranches are more abundant.
The Gulf of Thailand.
Introduction.
This coast of Thailand is a gigantic shallow depression just south of Cambodia. It is roughly 60 metres deep with a maximum of 85. The area has 112 islands with countless fringing reefs with rocks and succulent seabed. The reefs are not as varied as that of the Andaman Sea but the marine life is still prolific.
Ko Tao.
Ko Tao meaning Turtle Island, has grown into the hottest diving area in the country. The island with only an area of 21 sq km lies north of Ko Samui and Ko Phang-ngan.
The Chumphon Pinnacle, located 11 km from Ko Tao, consists of a massive granite pinnacle and a series of smaller one. It starts at 14 meters underwater and drops to a low of 44 meters, covered with sea anemones and pink anemones fish. Divers can even see schools of barracuda, jacks and batfish, then during the right season whale sharks appear. Recently suspected reef sharks which have been visiting seasonally for some time have been found to actually be bull sharks.
Green Rock between just one and 28 meters deep are boulder formations with an array of short tunnels and swim throws. Diving at the rock lets a view of parrot fish breeding, white eyed morays and blue spotted rays. The area is safe and is perfect for everyone of every level, although can be subject to strong currents.
The Nangyuan Pinnacle Its granite boulder formations have a diversity of swim-throughs and tropical reef fish such as groupers, longfin, bannerfin and blue spotted stingrays.
Shark Island just off the south-west coast is another dive with depths of almost 30 metres and hawksbill turtle, blue ridged angel, longfin banner, leopard sharks and reef sharks. The area is suitable for any standard of diving.
The South-west Pinnacle offers diving ranges between 5 and 30 metres deep. The series of steep pinnacles rise from the sandy seabed and offer an ample variety of colourful marine life, such as butterfly fish, blue-ringed angelfish, jacks, barracudas and occasional whale sharks.
Twins which lies just to the west of Ko Nangyuan is made of rocks with depths of 6 to 18 metres. Among the hard corals are big grouper, white-eyed moray eels, pink anemone, clown fish, blue spotted rays, wrasse and black and white sergeant major fish.
White Rock near Twins offers decent depths for all levels of divers and is suitable place for night dives. Marine life there includes butterfly fish, parrot fish, angel fish, large barracuda, titan trigger fish and red breasted wrasse.
Ko Pha Ngan.
This most beautiful of the 3 islands in the gulf is famous for its full-moon parties is a departure point for the northernmost part of the Ang Thong Marine National Park. The visibility in the area is just 10 metres with a highest of 25.
It is the closest island for visiting Sail Rock / Hin Bai.
Ko Samui.
Ko Samui is more renowned for its long sandy beaches and sizzling nightlife than its diving, but there are some enjoyable sites nearby.
Sail Rock is by far and away the most well-known dive site in the Ko Samui area. It is a rock pinnacle shaped like an iceberg which emerges from a sandy seabed at 40m to tower 15m above the surface. It is also a magnet for fish and there are schools of anemones and pink anemones.
Koh Yippon consists of 50 different islands. The visibility is lower than that of the other sites in the area.
Chumphon Province.
Chumphon province has an array of natural attractions and healthy diversity of marine life and fringing reefs. This place is also famous for night diving.
Ko Lak Ngam located just 15 km north-east of Chumphon, is one of 40 islands which belong to the Chumphon Marine National Park. There is plenty of hard and soft corals and hosts home to a large amount of sea life such as bat fish, trevally, fusiliers, turtle and seasonal whale sharks.
Pattaya.
Undoubtedly, the most popular destination in Pattaya for diving buffs is the Hardeep Wreck which was sunk by the allies in the Second World War. The wreck lies on its starboard side at a maximum depth of 26 m.
Ko Chang Marine National Park Ko Chang It is just one of a total 52 islands in the Marine National Park. Even though the area has previously been victim to man-made wrongs, there is still the chance to enjoy fringing reefs, marine life, a wreck, giant clams and snorkeling.
Hin Kuak Maa has a huge variety of solid and soft corals which are home to the likes of moray eels, blue spotted sting rays, sea turtles, starfish, stonefish and puffer fish.
Hin Luk Bath has turned into one of the most favored dive sites around with its boulder formations which appear from a sandy seabed 15 metres down The way they jut out allows a vast array of corals and barrel sponges. It is also possible to spot angel fish and barracuda.
Hin Rap South is an 18 metre rock pinnacle which can be dived by anyone of every level. It is covered with staghorn corals, barrel sponges and delicate corals. At 200 metres lies a group of rocks known as Blue Mountains which often glow from the sun.
Hin Run Tek with an average depth of 12 m, is a huge rock formation site with a diversity of colorful marine life such parrotfish, wrasse and angelfish.
Diving courses and types.
There are four diving companies operating in Thailand offering diving certification, they are:
Of all the above companies PADI is certainly the most famous. PADI, NAUI and SSI offer diving instruction at every major diving area in Thailand. They are:
The BSAC - The British Sub-Aqua Club offers instruction throughout Thailand.
Out of the entire above diving course location, Ko Tao has turned into the major destination for taking a diving course in Thailand.
Out of all the courses offered in Thailand, the basic Scuba Diver course is the most common.
Types of diving in Thailand.
All of the above types of diving can be experienced in Thailand at all major diving sites except wreck diving, which can be found at The Similans, Ko Phi Phi Pattaya and Koh Tao.
Of all the types of diving available in Thailand snorkeling and scuba diving are the most popular. Since people are becoming more and more aware of man-made destruction of natural coral etc. the popularity of Eco-diving has been soaring over the past few years.

Henry Ignatius Dudley Ryder

Henry Ignatius Dudley Ryder (b. 3 January 1837; d. at Edgbaston, Birmingham, 7 October 1907) was an English Roman Catholic priest of the Birmingham Oratory and controversialist. 
Life.
Ryder's lifelong connection with John Henry Newman and the Oratory began as a private pupil, when he was about twelve years old. The only interruption was a year at the English College at Rome and a few months at the Catholic University, Dublin, of which Newman was rector, before he began in December, 1856, his Oratorian novitiate. In 1863 he was ordained priest. 
After Cardinal Newman's death he was elected superior of the Birmingham Oratory and held this office till his health gave way. He was the last survivor of "my dearest brothers of this House, the Priests of the Birmingham Oratory" to whom Newman dedicated his "Apologia Pro Vita Sua". His grave is with theirs and Cardinal Newman's at Rednal, a small country house belonging to the Birmingham Oratory, about seven miles from Birmingham. 
His life was uneventful. He cared little for notoriety or even fame. Once only did he push himself forward. This was in 1867-8, when he attacked W. G. Ward, at that time editor of "Dublin Review". His opinions on papal infallibility, according to Ryder, were a caricature, and he delivered his protest in three pamphlets. He was criticised for them.
Works.
Apart from a number of articles in American and English magazines, he published:
There is besides "Essays of the Rev. H. I. D. Ryder, edited by Francis Bacchus" (London, 1911).
Family.
He was the eldest son of George Dudley Ryder, one of the numerous clergymen of the Church of England who followed in the steps of Newman, and Sophia Lucy, daughter of John Sargent. He was received into the Catholic Church at Rome in 1846. The grandfather, Henry Dudley Ryder, was a prominent Anglican Evangelical bishop. The three other Misses Sargent married Samuel Wilberforce, Henry Wilberforce, and Henry Edward Manning.

Western Australian state election, 1901

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 24 April 1901 to elect 50 members to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. It was the first election to take place since responsible government without the towering presence of Premier Sir John Forrest, who had left state politics two months earlier to enter the first Federal parliament representing the Division of Swan. 
The Ministerial group, led by Forrest's nominated successor George Throssell, ran a half-hearted campaign for government, with Throssell saying in a policy speech that while he would continue to serve as Premier if required, "it was not the class of political life he desired, as it interfered too much with his leisure." Meanwhile, the Opposition had no clear leader, with the Parliamentary leader Frederick Illingworth and George Leake, who was seeking to return to Parliament in the election, both apparently contenders. The groups were neither formal nor organised, with many members and candidates professing rather confused allegiances and running their own campaigns on local issues.
Following the introduction of payment of members in 1900, which effectively allowed men without independent means to sit in Parliament, the Labour Party offered 22 candidates to the voters compared to three at the previous election, each of which was pledged to the party's platform. The "Westralian Worker" newspaper, launched six months earlier, was used to publicise the campaign. They ultimately won six seats, of which five were located in the Goldfields.
No clear winner emerged, and considerable instability resulted as three Ministries either resigned or were defeated on a want of confidence motion. The situation was ultimately resolved when half of the Morgans Ministry were defeated in ministerial by-elections in December 1901, which gave the Opposition a narrow majority with Independent or Labour support.
The election took place based on boundaries established in the "Constitution Act Amendment Act 1899", which increased the number of members from 44 to 50 and reflected demographic changes—the Pilbara region lost two seats as did the Murchison region, whilst five seats were created in Kalgoorlie and the Eastern Goldfields and four seats were created in the Perth metropolitan area.

F.C. Nania

Nania F.C. (often called as "Abedi Pele's Nania Accra F.C.") is a Ghanaian professional football club based in Legon, Greater Accra. They are a currently competing in the Poly Tank Division One League.
History.
Match fixing Scandal.
Maha Ayew, wife of Abedi Pele, who is a director and a shareholder of Nania FC sued the Ghana Football Association as well as its President, Kwesi Nyantakyi, the chairmen of the Disciplinary and Appeals Committee of the FA – Amadu Tanko and Justice Anim Yeboah respectively, asking the court to restrain the FA from rehearing the alleged match of convenience case between her club and Okwawu United.
But the sitting judge in dismissing the suit explained that an application for judicial review cannot apply to the FA, stating that such applications are applicable to public bodies and not private bodies like FA.
Maha Ayew also by her status a director and shareholder of the club according to the judges decision could not have sued the FA because she did not have a real or substantial interest in Nania FC.
The ruling stated that the three persons - Kwesi Nyantakyi, Amadu Tanko and Justice Anim Yeboah acted in their official capacity and that they couldn’t have been sued in their private capacities.
A cost of 800 GH cedis each was awarded against Maha Ayew for the three correspondents while a 1, 000 GH cedi cost was slapped on Nania FC.
By the latest ruling, the Disciplinary Committee of the Ghana Football Association would re-hear the case involving the demotion of Nania FC and Okwawhu United.
The Appeals committee of the FA had set aside the ruling of the Disciplinary Committee banning the clubs for their roles in playing a match of convenience and directed the disciplinary body to re hear the matter. The club was banned for One-Year in October 2007.
Controversy.
Abedi Pele Ayew, Ghana's Soccer Maestro has been banned from participation in active football for one year by the Disciplinary Committee of the Ghana Football Association. The decision of the Committee follows the outcome of controversial Poly Tank Division One League results in which Abedi's Nania FC beat Okwahu United 31-0 while Great Mariners also beat Tudu Mighty Jets 29-0 in what most soccer lovers have described in various derogatory terms. The four affected Clubs Nania FC, Tudu Mighty Jets, Okwahu United and Mariners have also been fined 50 million cedis each and have all been demoted to the Ghana Division Three League.< Information gathered by dellsports from the Committee's sittings on Wednesday indicated that all the players and handlers of the affected Clubs have also been banned for a year.
It would be recalled that Brong Ahafo United, Advanced Stars, Akwatia Diamond Stars and Great Corinthians and others in the 70's were given various sanctions for involving in similar allegations of match fixing.
Director and Shareholder Maha Ayew was banned in October 2008 from Football.
FA Cup and Super Cup.
Nania FC beat Kumasi Asante Kotoko in July 2011 to win the reintroduced Ghanaian FA Cup and the club also went on to beat Berekum Chelsea to win the 2011 Ghana Super Cup. That feat won Abedi Pele the coach of the year and had his players winning most of the awards of the 2011 GFA awards in Ghana.
On 7 March 2012, CAF banned Nania for three years from international competition after their late withdrawal from the 2012 CAF Confederation Cup.

Nofei Prat

Nofei Prat (, "lit." Prat Scenes) is a communal Israeli settlement in the West Bank. Located near Ma'ale Adumim, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. In 2006 there were around 90 families living in the settlement. In 2009 about 140 families lived there. Both religious and secular families live in Nofei Prat. 
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
History.
The village was established on part of the lands of Kfar Adumim in 1992 by a group of settlers from Jerusalem. It was named after the nearby Prat Stream. On the morning after the elections for the thirteenth Knesset and Israeli Labor Party victory and before transition of power was made, a mixed group of mostly single religious and non-religious students from the Hebrew University drove east from Jerusalem to a barren hilltop with a plan to create a mixed community. They erected a flimsy structure which would later that day be followed by twenty-seven trailers. 
Transportation.
Nofei Prat was one of a number of settlements linked by a road secretly built by settlers in 1995. The road links Anatot to Kfar Adumim, Nofei Prat, and Alon. According to Pinhas Wallerstein, then head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the road was one of a number of secretly built roads under construction in the area. Wallerstein claimed that as council head, he did not need permission to construct roads, but that he would stop construction if the Israel Defense Forces told him to. He also said "What are they going to do, tell us to take the road away? If the road is illegal let them take us to court."
Design.
The settlement's master plan and its first 33 houses were designed by Jerusalem architect Marcy Goldwasser.

Ampress Works Halt railway station

Ampress Works Halt was a halt station on the Lymington Branch Line which, between 1956 and 1989, served the Wellworthy engineering works near Lymington in Hampshire, England. Sited near the bridge over the A337 Lymington to Brockenhurst road, the station closed when the engineering works ceased operation. The station never appeared in any public timetable.
History.
Opened by the Southern Region of British Railways in 1956, the station was served by Network SouthEast from the introduction of sectorisation until its closure. It was situated approximately from Lymington Town station near a bridge over the A337, and it was primarily intended for workers at the nearby Wellworthy factory. Constructed of concrete with chain-link fencing, it never appeared in any timetables and its demise came with the closure of the Wellworthy factory in 1989.
The site today.
Trains on the electrified Lymington branch line still pass the site. However as of June 2006 the new Lymington Hospital is being built on part of the old Wellworthy site, and the town of Lymington has also grown northwards to surround the location. The idea of reopening the halt, which still physically exists, has been discussed. 
The station's former sign now hangs on the wall of the train shed at Eastleigh Lakeside Railway at the Lakeside Country Park.

<doc id="18754942" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18754942" title="Alcohol laws of Kentucky">
Alcohol laws of Kentucky

The alcohol laws of Kentucky, which govern the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in that state, lead to a confusing patchwork of counties that are dry, prohibiting all sale of alcoholic beverages; wet, permitting full retail sales under state license; and "moist", occupying a middle ground between the two. The confusion is not restricted to a location's wet/dry status—for example, a justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court wrote in 1985 that the state's alcohol laws were a "maze of obscure statutory language" and "confusing at best." The general counsel of the Kentucky Office of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) noted in 2012, "That's still the case." This led Kentucky governor Steve Beshear to appoint a task force in summer 2012 to attempt to streamline the state's alcohol laws.
Quirks.
Apart from the laws governing local option elections by which communities can determine whether alcoholic beverages can be sold at all, many aspects of the state's alcohol laws were called "perplexing" in a 2012 story in one of Kentucky's largest newspapers, the "Lexington Herald-Leader". The confusion starts with licensing itself—the state issues more than 70 different types of licenses for alcohol sales.
One significant quirk is that wine can be purchased in a pharmacy, but not in a supermarket. The sale of wine and distilled spirits at pharmacies and grocery stores is regulated by laws that date to Prohibition. At the time, prescriptions for alcohol could be obtained at pharmacies. After the end of national Prohibition, sales were prohibited in grocery stores because it was thought that minors were more likely to be in those businesses than in pharmacies. Today, while grocery stores can hold wine and distilled spirits licenses, they can only sell such beverages if they provide a separate entrance to that part of the store and not allow minors to work there. By contrast, grocery stores can sell beer in the main shopping area.
Another inconsistency involves the difference between legal ages for buying and selling alcoholic beverages. The legal age for "purchase" is 21, as in all U.S. states. However, the legal age for "selling" or "serving" alcoholic beverages in a licensed establishment is 20. In the case of packaged beer, the legal selling age is 18, as long as the person is supervised by someone who is at least 20.
Wet and dry status.
The ABC uses very specific terminology to classify the state's 120 counties as "wet", "dry", "moist", or dry with special provisions.
In popular usage, "moist" has a much broader meaning than the ABC's specific usage. In addition to the ABC definition, "moist" can also refer to a county where alcohol sales have been approved under any of the special provisions allowed by Kentucky law—in other words, any status other than "dry" or "wet". More often, the term is used to refer to otherwise dry cities or counties that have approved restaurant sales by the drink, as evidenced by a July 2012 editorial by "The Independent" of Ashland where the term "moist" is repeatedly used to describe several such locations.
According to the last official ABC update of counties on January 3, 2013, 38 counties are dry, 32 are wet, and the remaining 50 are either "moist" or dry with special circumstances.
Possible definitions of "moist".
A county can be "moist", by popular definition, in several different ways:
Safety issues.
A study of about 39,000 alcohol-related traffic accidents in Kentucky found that residents of dry counties are more likely to be involved in such crashes, possibly because they have to drive farther from their homes to consume alcohol, thus increasing impaired driving exposure. The study concludes that county-level prohibition is not necessarily effective in improving highway safety.

Craig Owens said in an interview that he requested crayons, not colored pencils. He was supposedly disappointed by Equal Vision's mishap.

He was the first to preach the adoption of revolutionary methods for attaining Independence. When Anushilan Samiti was established in 1902, he became one of its earliest members.
The repression of revolutionary activities in Bengal by the British Government and family pressure diverted his attention from political activities to spiritual matters. He left home and became a monk in search of knowledge of God. In Nainital he met Soham Swami, a great Yogi and Guru.Soham Swami was a disciple of Tibbetibaba, a great saint of India.
Jyotindranath Banerjee became an ascetic in 1907.He established an 'Ashram' at Channa, and lived there till his death on 5 September 1930.

<doc id="18755175" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18755175" title="Kriegsbauart">
Kriegsbauart

The German term Kriegsbauart ("wartime class") refers to railway goods wagon classes that were developed during the Second World War for the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The start of the war was an arbitrary dividing line for the classification of goods wagons, and did not represent any technological change. In the period shortly before the war, goods wagons were already being designed from a military perspective. This was particularly true for the stake wagons of 1938, which are occasionally referred to as a 'pre-war class' ("Vorkriegsbauart") of wagons.
The transition from the welded Austauschbauart goods wagons to the first Kriegsbauart classes was therefore defined, not so much by design changes, but far more by a concentration on fewer types of wagons and their construction in greater numbers. The cause of this was the rapid increase in transportation tasks, because the railways in German were sucked into the events of war as never before. The Deutsche Reichsbahn was seen as an indispensable partner of National Socialism, both for the transportation of vehicles, troops and supplies as well as the deportation of Jews to the Nazi concentration camps.
From 1954, the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany put many goods wagons through its reconstruction programme. Some of these were in service until the start of the 1990s.
For consistency, the division of the goods wagons described in this article is based on that in the "Austauschbauart" article.
Standard Goods Wagons.
Of the eight standard goods wagons that were built in significant quantities as "Austauschbauart" classes, there were only four types for which there was a further requirement in 1939: the two covered vans (G…s Oppeln and Gl…s Dresden), the stake wagons (Rs Stuttgart) and the open goods wagons (Om). Because the first three had been continuously developed during the 1930s, they still met wartime requirements and were built in very large batches during the early years of the war. They sometimes had so-called refinements that speeded up production and minimised the amount of steel used.
For the open wagons, by contrast, not only was a higher maximum load demanded, but also a greater loading volume. As a result, in 1937/38 the Omm wagon was designed from scratch with a maximum load of 24.5 tons and a loading length of (as opposed to on Om wagons). Construction began in 1939. Notable external features are the axle base of and the three-dimensional strut frame that tapers downwards to a point. A total of 73,850 of these wagons appeared in three variants:
All Omm wagons were equipped with "Hildebrandt-Knorr" brakes as well as, in some cases, hand brakes. The Ommr Linz wagons were especially well-suited to carrying vehicles and had special securing equipment for that purposes.
Standard Goods Wagons With Steel-Saving Features.
During the war, the four standard goods wagons were sometimes redesigned with slightly different dimensions. They had to be 
sparing in their use of steel, and faster and cheaper to manufacture. Sometimes design solutions were found that clearly streamlined goods wagon construction. These wagons, built from 1943 onwards, were lighter than their predecessors, but at the same time could carry more. However, the cost of using cheaper steel and thinner profiles was greater wear and tear and a permanent deformation from the outset. As a result, after a few years, extensive improvements were needed.
Special Goods Wagons.
More special wagons appeared, albeit no longer in pre-war quantities. Several classes, which had already been developed before 1939, continued in production, sometimes modified. In order of production quantity they were:
Important new builds, in order of quantity, were:

Jean-Denis Cochin

Jean-Denis Cochin (born in Paris, 1 January 1726; died there 3 June 1783) was a French Roman Catholic priest, preacher and philanthropist. He founded in 1780 Paris's Hôpital Cochin, as the hospice of Saint-Jacques du Haut Pas, in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques.
Life.
His father, Claude-Denis Cochin (d. 1786), was known as a botanist. Jean-Denis followed a course of theological studies in the Sorbonne and was graduated with the degree of Doctor. In 1755 he was ordained priest.
The next year he was given charge of the parish of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. There he spent his whole life working for the material as well as the spiritual betterment of his people. He won great fame for his preaching.
Cochin is noted especially for his philanthropy. The needs of his own parish suggested the foundation of a hospital. The idea, conceived in 1780, resulted in the completion of a building of which The Sisters of Charity took charge. The inscription on the building, Pauper clamavit et Dominus exaudivit eum, is an index of Cochin's intentions. He devoted his whole fortune to the work. The hospital was inaugurated with thirty-eight beds; today it is a large institution. It was originally called Hôpital Saint-Jacques. In 1801 the General Council of the Paris hospitals gave it the name of its charitable founder, which it still preserves.

Cobham RFC

Cobham Rugby Football Club is an English rugby union club, located in the village of Cobham, Surrey, who play in the London Division of the RFU in the 2013-2014 Season. Cobham RFC is based at the Old Surbitonians Memorial Ground in Cobham. Cobham RFC is affiliated to the English RFU via the Surrey RFU. The club was founded in 1930 by the first leavers of the Surbiton County Grammar (now Esher College)
History.
The club was formed in 1930 as Old Surbitonians RFC by the first group of school leavers from Surbiton County Grammar School for Boys. In 1949, as a memorial to those Old Boys who perished in World War II, the grounds at Fairmile Lane, Cobham, were purchased. After the school moved from its original site in Surbiton to Esher as a boys' grammar school, The Braemar Club was created to honour the old school building. The change of name of the school to Esher County Grammar School and more prominently the evolution of the old school into a mixed sixth form college had a significant and detrimental impact on the flow of young players into the Club, which was one of the driving forces behind the club being one of the first in the country to set up a Mini Rugby section, in the Golden Jubilee year of 1980. Mini Rugby spawned a sizeable and flourishing Youth section, which has produced national Champions at various levels. The club was placed in the new 1st division of the new Surrey Leagues when the RFU introduced League Rugby in 1987. Prior to this, the club had enjoyed much success, including a famous unbeaten season of 1963-64, and a Surrey Cup Final appearance in 1976. The club changed its name in 1989 to Cobham Rugby Football Club, to both identify more closely with the immediate surrounding area, and to signify the change to an open membership club. Recent years have seen the clubs' steady progress through the leagues, with four promotions in six seasons in the Leagues since 1987, and success elsewhere in winning the Surrey Shield in 1999. The 1sts now play in London South Division 2 following successive promotions under the stewardship of Head Coach, Billy Davison. Despite its name change, it still recognises its heritage and association with the old school.
Cobham Rugby have a strong heritage as a community sports club with one of the largest Minis sections (U5 to U12) in the country leading to a strong Youth section (U13-U18) and onto senior sides including a veterans side, the All Stars. During 2007 the club raised significant funds from within alongside a legacy from a former player, Peter Marsh, which was Sportsmatched allowing the rebuilding of the clubhouse with a two storey sports and social facility. It announced on 9 May 2011 the acquisition of rights to double the playing areas to six pitches by utilising the derilict golf driving range behind the local Fairmile Pub. The rugby Club share the facilities with Cobham Tennis, Cobham Lacrosse and Cobham Netball.

Its maximum width is about 30 km and it has a branch or inlet extending northwards midway between its mouth and its most inland shore point. The Omullyakhskaya Bay lies north of Khromskaya Bay and shares the same mouth. 
This bay is in an area of wetlands; lakes and marshes dot the whole landscape. The Khroma River flows into this bay from the south. 
Owing to is northerly location the Khromskaya Bay is covered with ice most of the year. In the summer the bay is a breeding and moulting area for the Lesser White-fronted Goose.

Shadow IT

Shadow IT is a term often used to describe IT systems and IT solutions built and used inside organizations without explicit organizational approval. It is also used, along with the term "Stealth IT," to describe solutions specified and deployed by departments other than the IT department.
Shadow IT is considered by many an important source for innovation and such systems may turn out to be prototypes for future approved IT solutions. On the other side, shadow IT solutions are not often in line with the organization's requirements for control, documentation, security, reliability, etc., although these issues can apply equally to authorized IT solutions.
Compliance issues.
It is a term used in IT for any application or transmission of data, relied upon for business processes, which is not under the jurisdiction of a centralized IT or IS department. The IT department did not develop it, or was not aware of it, and does not support it. This increases the likelihood of ‘unofficial’ and uncontrolled data flows, making it more difficult to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (USA) and many other compliance-centric initiatives, such as:
Examples.
Some examples of these unofficial data flows are USB sticks or other portable data storage devices, MSN Messenger or other online messaging software, Gmail or other online e-mail services, Google Docs or other online document sharing and Skype or other online VOIP software, and also other less straightforward products self-developed Access databases and self-developed Excel spreadsheets and macros. Security risks are introduced when data or applications are moved outside protected systems, networks, physical location or security domains.
A 2012 French survey of 129 IT managers revealed some examples of Shadow IT :
Excel Macro 19%
software 17%
Cloud solutions 16%
ERP 12%
BI systems 9%
Websites 8%
Hardware 6%
VoIP 5%
Shadow IT support 5%
Shadow IT project 3%
BYoD 3%
Reasons for use.
Incumbent IT management dealing with legacy infrastructure and data management challenges cannot easily provision data as a service either because they are unaware of its advantages, or cannot acquire the budget for its successful implementation. Against this background, neither can the IT department ever deliver against all business requirements at a low enough cost relative to a true DaaS IT department. These deficiencies lead the business to implement IT solutions that may be perceived to cost less to execute, albeit whilst introducing risks which a formal IT project could avoid.
For example, with the rise of powerful desktop CPUs, business subject matter experts can use shadow IT systems to extract and manipulate complex datasets without having to request work from the IT department. The challenge for IT is to recognize this activity and improve the technical control environment, or to guide the business in selecting enterprise-class data analysis tools.
A further barrier to adopting DaaS is the legacy IT bulk provisioning of only the 'Read' element of the CRUD model (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This leads IT into neglecting the need to 'write back' into the original dataset, because this is complex to achieve. It is the need of shadow IT users to then store this changed data separately (I.E. 'siloeing') that results in a loss of organisational data integrity.
Placing barriers to shadow IT can be the equivalent of stifling organizational innovation and cost reduction.
A study confirms that 35% of employees feel they need to work around a security measure or protocol to be able to do their work efficiently. 63% send documents to their home e-mail address to continue work from home, even when they are aware that this is probably not allowed.
Implications.
Besides security risks, some of the implications of Shadow IT are:
Wasted time.
Shadow IT adds hidden costs to organizations, consisting largely of non-IT workers in finance, marketing, HR, etc., who spend a significant amount of time discussing and re-checking the validity of certain data, setting up and managing systems and software without experience.
Inconsistent business logic.
If a ‘shadow IT’ spreadsheet application encapsulates its own definitions and calculations, it is likely that over time inconsistencies will arise from the accumulation of small differences from one version to another and from one group to another, as spreadsheets are often copied and modified. In addition, many errors that occur from either lack of understanding of the concepts or incorrect use of the spreadsheet frequently go undetected due to a lack of rigorous testing and version control.
Inconsistent approach.
Even when the definitions and formulas are correct, the methodology for doing analysis can be distorted by the arrangement and flow of linked spreadsheets, or the process itself can be wrong.
Wasted investment.
Shadow IT applications sometimes prevent full Return on investment (ROI) from investments in systems that are designed to perform the functions now replaced by Shadow IT. This is often seen in Data warehousing (DW) and Business informatics (BI) projects, which are initiated with good intentions, where the broader and consistent usage of DW and BI in the organization never really starts off. This can also be caused by management failure to anticipate deployment, licensing and system capacity costs when attempting to deliver DW & BI solutions. Adopting an internal cost model that forces potential new users of the DW/BI system to choose cheaper (shadow) alternatives, also plays a part in preventing successful enterprise implementation.
Inefficiencies.
Shadow IT can be a barrier to innovation by blocking the establishment of more efficient work processes. Additional performance bottlenecks and new single points of failure may be introduced when Shadow IT systems layer on top of existing systems. Data might be exported from a shared system to a spreadsheet to perform the critical tasks or analysis.
Higher risk of data loss or leaks.
Shadow IT data backup procedures may not be provided or audited. Personnel and contractors in Shadow IT operations may not be put through normal education, procedures or vetting processes. Originators of Shadow IT systems may leave the organization often leaving with proprietary data or leaving behind complicated systems the remainder of staff cannot manage.
Barrier to enhancement.
Shadow IT can act as a brake on the adoption of new technology. Because e.g. spreadsheets are deployed to fill critical needs, they must be replaced carefully. But lacking adequate documentation, controls and standards, that process is slow and error-prone.
Organizational dysfunction.
Shadow IT creates a dysfunctional environment leading to animosity between IT and non-IT related groups within an organization. Improper motivations behind Shadow IT efforts such as seeking job-security (i.e. "Bob is the only person with this data" or "what will happen if he leaves?"), data hoarding, self-promotion, favor trading, etc. can lead to significant management issues.
Effect on IT Departments.
According to Gartner, by 2015, 35 percent of enterprise IT expenditures for most organizations will be managed outside the IT department's budget.
