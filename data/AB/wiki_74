On Monday 24, 2010 he was given another Socceroos cap against New Zealand in a pre-world cup friendly. He was given 10 minutes and impressed with his surging runs, and energy. His display may have helped lead coach Pim Verbeek to the decision to take him to the World Cup in South Africa in the 28-man squad over fellow Australian midfielder Nick Carle.

He was re-called to the squad for Australia's first match after the World Cup, a friendly against Slovenia on 11 August 2010.

RTA TV

RTA, known as تلویزیون ملی ("Telvizun-E-Milli", meaning "National Television") in Persian, is a television channel originally founded in 1964; the first in Afghanistan. It is owned by Radio Television Afghanistan (from the Afghan government).
Exclusive 2008 speech.
RTA became famous worldwide when Afghan President Hamid Karzai made a live speech to the world minutes after dozens of insurgents attempted to assassinate him at an Afghan military parade. The assassination attempt was thwarted by the Afghan National Army. The scene of the attempt was also broadcast live to RTA viewers in Afghanistan and picked up by the international media.
International launch.
RTA became available in Europe, Middle East, North Africa and North America on 5 January 2008. The channel's broadcasting hours were originally 06:00 to 00:00 (local Afghan time), corresponding to 01:30 to 19:30 GMT. Later in 2008, RTA became a 24-hour channel, and this allowed viewers Internationally to watch it at more convenient hours.
Logo.
RTA's original logo had three squares (black, red, green, corresponding to the Afghan flag), with the letters R, T and A.
On 12 March 2010, a shelter was added at the top of the three squares, and the font was slightly changed and was smaller in size. Also, the top of the squares became round-shaped instead of straight. It is thought that the shelter is the top of a mosque.
In May 2011, a second logo was introduced which had the letters (from right to left) ﺮ ,ﻣ and ﺖ on it. This phonetically means "MRT", which stands for "Afghan Milli Radio Telvizun". This means "Afghan National Radio Television" in English. On 26 July 2011, even a third logo was introduced - a brown-coloured symbol, stating ﺮ ,ﻣ and ﺖ.
5 days later, this brown logo appeared as the only on-screen logo on ART.
On 8 July 2011, the brown logo was removed and was replaced by a logo stating 'ﻣﻠﯽ' with the flag's background colours: black, red and green.
Out of all channels in Afghanistan, ART has had the most logo changes.
Strangely, ART's website still features the old logo used before 12 March 2010.

Bassinthedust

Bassinthedust is an Australian music festival. It is the second largest music festival in the Northern Territory, and has been held annually since 2004 in Alice Springs. The festival is an offshoot of Bassinthegrass and is operated by the Northern Territory Government through the Northern Territory Major Events Company, part of a project of the previous Martin government to bring prominent bands to the territory and showcase local talent. Bassinthedust has grown rapidly since its inception. It is a sister festival of Bassinthegrass, replacing an Alice Springs leg of Bassinthegrass which had been held at the first festival in 2003.
History.
Bassinthegrass was first held in 2003, to fulfill a campaign promise by the Martin government to hold a Big Day Out-style youth concert in the territory. It was held in both Darwin and Alice Springs in its inaugural year, with the Alice Springs leg later becoming the Bassinthedust festival. 5000 people attended the Darwin leg, with a further 1500 in Alice Springs, listening to headline acts The Living End, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, and NoKTuRNL. It was widely hailed as a success in the territory media, and became an annual event.
The Alice-only Bassinthedust festival was first held in 2004 at the Memo Club on 11 September 2004 to an audience of around 1200. The 2005 festival, featuring Spiderbait, Frenzal Rhomb, The Flairz, Screaming Jets, and Dallas Crane, was held at Anzac Oval (where all but the first festival have been held) on Saturday 10 September. The 2006 festival, featuring End of Fashion, Pete Murray and The Living End, was held on Saturday 23 September with an audience of around 2300. Hilltop Hoods were meant to play but were unable to make it to Alice Springs for the show. They later put on a show to make up for missing the festival. Jet headlined the 2007 festival on Saturday 22 September.
Bassinthedust 2008 will be held on October 4 at Anzac Oval.

Giovanni Battista Casali

Giovanni Battista Casali (1715–1792) was an Italian musician.
Casali was born in Rome in 1715. From 1759 until his death he held the position of choir-master in the Basilica of St. John Lateran. Casali was one of the last of his period to write for voices "a cappella".
Works.
Of his numerous compositions a mass in G major and several motets (Confitebor tibi, Ave Maria, Exaltabo, Improperium) have been reprinted in Lueck's "Collection" (Trier, 1859). These compositions, while liturgical in spirit and form, show a considerable departure from the tradition of the Roman School in a freer use of dissonance, and they also bear witness to the influence of opera, in which form Casali also wrote. Most of his works are preserved in the library of Abbate Santini in Rome.

Autopsy (album)

Autopsy is a compilation album by 45 Grave. It contains new tracks, alternate versions of existing tracks and the single "Black Cross" and its b-side "Wax." 
Black Cross.
"Black Cross" is 45 Grave's debut single. It was not featured on an album but was later included on "Autopsy", and remains a staple of their live performances. It is a good example of 45 Grave's style: a blend of goth and punk rock.
The b-side, "Wax," was likewise never featured on a studio album, but saw release on "Autopsy". "Wax" differs from other early works by 45 Grave as it dips more into the heavy metal genre, creating a slow, atmospheric, heavy goth song.
"Black Cross" was covered by alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers on their "Live in Hyde Park" album.

Faust (Spohr)

Faust is an opera by the German composer Louis Spohr. The libretto, by Josef Karl Bernard, is based on the legend of Faust; it is not influenced by Goethe's Faust, though "" had been published in 1808. Instead, Carl Bernard's libretto draws mainly on Faust plays and poems by Maximilian Klinger and Heinrich von Kleist. Spohr's "Faust" is an important work in the history of German Romantic opera.
Performance history.
Spohr had left his court appointment at Gotha and taken up a post in Vienna at the Theater An der Wien, which had recently been purchased by Count Ferdinand Palffy von Erdöd. He composed the opera in less than four months, May to September 1813 but had difficulties with count Palffy that interfered with getting it staged in Vienna. Though he took the manuscript score privately to Giacomo Meyerbeer, who played it, with Spohr singing— supplementing his vocal range by whistling— it was not until Carl Maria von Weber took an interest in the score that it received its premiere. Weber conducted the first performance of "Faust" at the Ständetheater, Prague on 1 September 1816. Meyerbeer introduced it at Berlin.
In its original form, the opera was a "Singspiel" in two acts. In 1851, Spohr turned the piece into a grand opera in three acts, replacing the spoken dialogue with recitative. This "version (in an Italian translation) received its premiere at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, London on 15 July 1852. The Bielefeld Opera rediscovered "Faust" in 1993 in the first staged production world-wide since 1931. Conducted by Geoffrey Moull and directed by Matthias Oldag, the opera was given 8 performances and subsequently recorded for CPO.
Synopsis.
Faust is torn between his love for the young Röschen and his desire for Kunigunde, the fiancée of Count Hugo. He makes a pact with the devil Mefistofeles which allows him to rescue Kunigunde from the clutches of the evil knight Gulf. Faust obtains a love potion from the witch Sycorax which he gives to Kunigunde during her wedding celebrations. Outraged at the sudden passion his bride shows for Faust, Count Hugo challenges him to a duel. Faust kills Hugo and flees. Meanwhile, Faust's first love, Röschen, drowns herself in despair. Mefistofeles seizes Faust and drags him down to Hell.

Hooli

Hooli - is in Belgaum District in Karnataka India. It is about 9 km from Saundatti. Hooli has so many temples, each has its own well. Even the remotest location on the hills has temples.
One of the oldest villages in the Belgaum District, it is famous for Panchaligeswara temple. Some of the other ruined temples waiting for conservation and restoration. On the outskirts of Hooli is the Trikuteshwara Temple.
The village is historically rich, boasting of a ruined fort atop a hill, numerous temples and many freedom fighters.
Hooli has been under the rule of the Ratta's of Saundatti, Patwardhans of Ramdurg and most of the temples here are of Chalukya architecture and were initially Jain Basti's indicating a Chalukya rule.
The name of the village is a corrupted form of PooValli meaning a flowery ear ornament. The village was also called MahishpatiNagar in ancient times.
Hooli temples.
Panchalingeshwara temple Hooli.
The nice architecture of Hooli Panchalingeshwar Temple is to be adored. It is a protected monument that comes under Archeological Survey of India. Earlier, during summer afternoons people used to rest in the shade of this temple. Because the temple was made of stone, it was unbelievably cool even in the scorching summer.
Opposite the Panchalingeshwara temple is the relatively modern Hari Mandir. The Sant Culture or Nath tradition influenced heavily by Jnaneshwar flourished here.
Conservation and restoration.
Other than Panchalingeshwara Temple, Hooli has many other old temples; most of them are now in ruins due to negligence. One can be amazed by the sculptures and carvings on the stone. Most of the temples have their floor dug up for treasure hunts, so much is lost and stolen.
Other temples at Hooli are
These temples are in need of conservation and restoration.
Tourism Plans (Unconfirmed as of December 2013).
There probably are plans or proposals to convert the Panchlingeshwar Temple site to a tourist destination. To achieve this objective, the concerned central/state department has performed survey and has been in discussion with the local people. This development may involve the demolition of local houses within the perimeter of some 100–200 meters. In case this happens, it would be a great shame, as this very structures, most of them mud houses surrounding the temple are also a part of the village history and carry invaluable importance to the local architecture settings. In India, the lessons needs to be derived from observing how some of the world heritage sites around the world, is being preserved and more importantly recreated as its original state.
An ideal solution to preserve the architecture and as well encourage tourism is to develop a tourism infrastructure outside the village and then facilitate organized tours to the temple. Hotels, restaurants, shops, parking places etc. should not be allowed to flourish anywhere within the existing village or nearby the temple site and instead be located outside the village. If required, evacuate the population in affected perimeter, but preserve each and every structures as they are and convert them to museums. The village Hooli is still alive with activity and its surroundings has lot of history and architecture to share with tourists and fill few museums around the site.
Any development in the vicinity of the site is going to be disastrous, difficult to maintain, and loose the charm of the very architecture piece, that is being showcased. Not to say that the impacted villagers will not only lose their ancestral home, but instead become detached from the village itself, where, their ancestors once upon a time created and served this archaeological masterpiece. Rather, the old mud houses should be maintained as they are and there owners / residents should be made partners in their conservation. For someone, who has experienced and lived in the village 30 or 40 years back, which once had streets paved with cobbled stones, the ruins of temple around the village which had number of precious architecture pieces, is now all but stolen or destroyed. Further degradation is not necessary in name of the preservation and encouraging tourism.
Shivakashi Stream.
Shivakashi Valley seems to be a place which was once densely covered by trees. At this location you can find the marks left by monsoon springs and water falls. Based on stories from village elders there were tigers once upon a time. Village folks hunted them off decades ago.
The location otherwise is dotted with many temples and wells. There is a Dhyan Mandir used by Krishnaraj Swamiji as the legend has it. The view from the top of the hill is picturesque. The water cascades down at various levels and flows to join the lake in front of KereSiddeshwara Temple.
Hooli Surname.
Ancestors born & brought up at this place migrated to nearby villages over a long period of time, they were referred to as people from "Hooli", hence many families have their surnames as "Hooli".
However, the most common surnames in the village itself are Kulkarni, Patil, Chikkareddi. These families have been living in the same area for hundreds of years now and every family is invariably interrelated.

<doc id="18755613" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18755613" title="Orthodox Roundtable">
Orthodox Roundtable

Orthodox Roundtable (a.k.a. The RCA Roundtable) was a Modern Orthodox rabbinic think tank that functioned from 1988 until 1994. Originally conceived by a group of orthodox rabbis and laypersons in the New York area, the goal of the Roundtable was to promote halakhic discussion of pressing contemporary issues, and to suggest solidly grounded responses to those problems. The solutions offered were meant to reflect authentic, valid halakhic responses that would reflect the spectrum of the Modern Orthodox community. In this sense, the group would provide a counterbalance to the already palpable 'shift to the right' that appeared to characterize orthodox Jewish legal authorities and thinking. From 1990 until 1992, the group was officially part of the Rabbinical Council of America, whose president, Rabbi Marc Angel, was a founding member of the group.
Early history.
The initial organization of the Roundtable was undertaken in the Spring of 1988 by Rabbi Jeffrey Woolf, at the behest of prominent lay and rabbinic leaders from Riverdale, NY, where he resided. Woolf, who had studied for ten years under Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and was a doctoral candidate at Harvard University, was suggested to the founders as a good representative of Modern Orthodox principles. Over the next few months, a group of prominent Orthodox Rabbis agreed to join the initiative. Most, though not all, were graduates of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) of Yeshiva University, and had themselves studied under Rabbi Soloveitchik. 
The initial core group included: Rabbis J. Simcha Cohen, Reuven Bulka, Yosef Adler, Haskel Lookstein, Marc Angel, Yitz Greenberg, Jacob J. Schacter, Daniel Landes, Mark Dratch, Michael Broyde, Louis Bernstein, Abner Weiss, Daniel Tropper and Saul Berman. The group was later joined by Rabbis Simcha Weinberg and Adam Mintz. In the interim Rabbi Schacter resigned from the group. Rabbis Cohen and Bulka were elected as co-chairmen. Rabbi Woolf was appointed as Executive Chairman.
Activity.
Over the course of the next five years, the Roundtable issued a series of position papers on a wide range of cutting edge issues. Generally, these were authored by one member, and vetted by the group prior to publication. Each paper was carefully crafted and extensively documented. The members were well aware of the fact that they were asserting their right to a voice in Orthodox halakhic discourse. As a result, papers were only issued after being carefully reviewed by the most scholarly members of the group (and, on occasion, some who sympathized without actually joining). They were sent primarily to the members of the RCA, though anyone who was interested could receive one. 
A significant number of the topics treated by the Roundtable Papers stood at the center of controversy in the Orthodox World, some ten years later. Toward the end of its activity, the group was honored by receiving permission from Rav Ovadiah Yosef to publish an annotated translation of a responsum advocating the imposition of penalties upon a recalcitrant husband who refused to give a get to his wife.
Cessation of Activity.
At the time, the groups efforts were both condemned and dismissed by Agudath Yisrael, and a number of the Roshei Yeshiva of RIETS. Primarily, they decried the temerity of these rabbis to venture into the halakhic lists. Responses of this type were reported in the Spring of 1991 in the Jerusalem Report. In an effort to strengthen the position in the community, Rabbi Marc Angel, engineered the adoption of the Roundtable by the Rabbinical Council of America. The merger was successful during Rabbi Angel's tenure. However, following his term in office, elements within and without the RCA sought to restrict and regulate its publications. In 1991, the partnership was dissolved and the Roundtable reverted to its earlier name and format.
Subsequently, the organization was plagued by internal tensions, as well as political pressures. These caused an organizational re-shuffling in 1992, in which Rabbi Cohen resigned as co-chairman. Leadership remained in the hands of Rabbi Reuven Bulka and Rabbi Jeffrey Woolf. In the Summer of 1993, Rabbi Jeffrey Woolf made Aliyah to Israel, in order to accept a faculty position in the Talmud Department of Bar Ilan University. Rabbi Adam Mintz, then the senior rabbi at Lincoln Square Synagogue, succeeded him as Executive Chairman. 
The Orthodox Roundtable ceased operations in the Summer of 1994.

Taavi Peetre

Taavi Peetre (5 July 1983 – 11 September 2010) was an Estonian shot putter and discus thrower. He represented his country at two Olympic Games (in 2004 and 2008) and also took part in the World Championships in Athletics on two occasions. His personal best shot put mark of 20.33 m is the second best by an Estonian thrower after Heino Sild. His personal best in discus throw was 60.84 m, achieved in April 2010 in Denton, Texas, USA. He died in 2010 after a boat accident.
Career.
Born in Käina Parish, his first major international competition was the 1999 World Youth Championships in Athletics, where he was tenth in the discus throw qualifiers of the competition's inaugural edition. Peetre finished ninth in the shot put final at the 2002 World Junior Championships, having already thrown a national junior record of 17.71 m earlier that year, and also competed in the qualifiers of the discus contest. He improved his best shot put mark to 19.02 m the following year and made his first Olympic appearance at the 2004 Olympic Games.
Having changed his focus to primarily the shot put, the 2005 season marked a further breakthrough into the senior ranks. He represented Estonia at the 2005 European Athletics Indoor Championships and then at the 2005 World Championships later in the season, but did not get past the qualifiers on either occasion. He enjoyed success at lower level competitions, however, winning shot put silver medals at the 2005 European Athletics U23 Championships, 2005 Universiade, and in the A League of the 2005 European Cup.
He improved his indoor shot put best in February 2006, throwing 19.81 m, and was eleventh at the European Cup Winter Throwing. He retained his runner-up place in the A League section of the 2006 European Cup, but managed only eleventh in the qualifiers of his first continental outdoor championships, the 2006 European Athletics Championships. A low-key 2007 was highlighted by a win at the national championships and eighteenth in the qualifiers at the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships.
He returned to top form in 2008, throwing over sixty metres in the discus for the first time and putting a season's best of 20.22 m in the shot just prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. At his second Olympic shot put competition he had a best mark of 19.57 m but failed to reach the final round. In 2009 he regained the national shot put title and gave his best performance at a global event at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics: his mark of 19.91 m was the fifth best of his qualification group, but this was not enough to progress to the final. He achieved a personal best in the shot put of 20.33 m in July 2010 in Viljandi, Estonia. His last major international championships was the 2010 European Athletics Championships, where he threw 19.42 m for seventh place in the qualifying round.
On 11 September 2010, Peetre drowned in Lake Tamula during a fishing trip with friends.

Then she studied clay modelling in Munich at the State School of Applied Arts under Karl Killer (1928–29). She was fellow student here, then lifelong friend of Julia Bathory, glass artist. She studied in Copenhagen in 1932 and in 1933 she was at Sèvres Porcelain factory where she mastered the art of modelling with chamotte clay to make figures.
Her first public exhibition was in Budapest in 1928 and from then on her output was prolific and she continued working throughout the Second World War. She produced statuettes, pots, plates, wall plaques and tiled murals.
Her main themes are country folk, family life and bible stories. Her work is very varied but is characterised by flowing lines which curve sensually to evoke sentiment. One of her most significant works of religious art are the portals of the Saint Emeric Church of Győr (1939–1940).
In 1972 she donated the majority of her work to the Pest County Museums Directorate in Szentendre. A museum of her work was opened in 1973 in Vastagh Street, Szentendre.

The Blueprint 3

The Blueprint 3 is the eleventh studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, released September 8, 2009, on Roc Nation. It is the final installment in "The Blueprint" trilogy, preceded by "The Blueprint" (2001) and "" (2002). Production for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at several recording studios and was handled by Kanye West, The Neptunes, Jeff Bhasker, Al Shux, Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon, No I.D., The Inkredibles, Swizz Beatz, and Timbaland.
The album debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, selling 476,000 copies in its first week. It became Jay-Z's eleventh US number-one album, breaking the record he had previously shared with Elvis Presley, and produced five singles that achieved chart success. Upon its release, "The Blueprint 3" received generally positive reviews from music critics.
Background.
The earliest hype over "The Blueprint 3" came when DJ Clue released in January 2008 a mixtape song called "Ain't I", produced by Timbaland. In the intro, Clue says, "Off that "Blueprint 3" baby!" However, a spokesperson for Jay-Z said that it was an old, unreleased song and that the recording of "The Blueprint 3" had not yet started. On July 20, Timbaland, a frequent contributor to previous Jay-Z albums, told MTV News that he would be producing the whole album. But in an interview with the "Rolling Stone" magazine, Jay-Z called the statement "premature". In July 2009, Jay-Z confirmed "The Blueprint 3" as the album's title during an interview with radio station Shade 45.
By November 2008, he had finished the album but with lengthy negotiations with Def Jam, he went onto reworking it. In January 2009, Jay-Z confirmed continued production of the album and admitted the leak of several songs. In a "Billboard" magazine interview, Jay-Z confirmed "What We Talkin' About", the album's intro, "Thank You", and "Already Home" as song names and collaborations with Australian dance group Empire of the Sun, rappers Drake and Kid Cudi and singer Rihanna. He also mentioned in an interview with DJ Semtex that his favorite song on the album is "Empire State of Mind". The official tracklist for "Blueprint 3" was revealed on August 18, confirming the guest appearances from Alicia Keys, Drake, Kanye West, Rihanna, Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, J. Cole, and more.)
Cover artwork.
The cover consists of a large amount of all-white instruments and recording tools stacked in a corner, with three red lines across the image. Rather than simply using photoshop, the album's design team carefully stacked all the equipment in a corner then used a projector to create the bars. They then painted red onto the equipment where the projection of the bars was, and replaced the projector with a camera to achieve the correct perspective for the image. "Blueprint 3" would be his first album cover that did not feature Jay-Z's face on it.
Recording.
Most of the album's recording sessions took place in Hawaii at Avex Honolulu Studio, in an effort to avoid leakage. West's protégé Mr Hudson explained to "The Times" that he "won't get bothered there" compared to a major city such as New York or Los Angeles. Sessions for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at Avex Honolulu Studio and several other recording studios, including Germano Studios, Oven Studios, and Roc The Mic in New York City, Kingdom Studios and Lava Studios in Cleveland, Midnight Blue Studios and South Beach Studios in Miami, The Holy Chateau in Perth, Australia, and Westlake Studio in Los Angeles.
Jay-Z told "Rolling Stone" his method of selecting producers: "If Timbaland makes ten great tracks then he produces the album, if Kanye West makes ten great tracks then he produces the album; if he makes three, I'll take three. I let the music dictate the direction." However, the final track listing reveals, that West produced the majority of tracks on the album, and three done by Timbaland. West confirmed two songs, "A Star Is Born" and "Young Forever", during an appearance on "The Wake Up Show" in February 2009. Mr Hudson, who is the featured artist on the latter, described it as a flip on the Alphaville record of a similar name. During a joint interview with Hudson, West confirmed that the pop artist would be featured on three songs. Pharrell stated that he emailed "So Ambitious" to Jay-Z the day he was mastering the album. He loved the track so much that he put off the mastering.
Release and promotion.
The album was released September 8, 2009 on Roc Nation in the United States. It was also released digitally on September 11, 2009 in the US, and its United Kingdom and international release followed on September 14 that same year. Prior to its official release, the album leaked in its entirety on August 31, 2009. When asked about the leak, Jay-Z stated "It's a preview. I'm excited for people to hear the album. I'm very proud of the work I've done, so enjoy it".
The album's first single "D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)" was premiered on June 5, 2009 via New York radio station Hot 97. On June 7, 2009 Jay-Z made a guest appearance at Hot 97's Summer Jam concert, and performed D.O.A. live on stage, for the first time. On May 20, 2009, Jay-Z confirmed that he bought out the remainder of his contract from Def Jam Records in order to start his contract with Live Nation, as "The Blueprint 3" was set to be released under Roc Nation and distributed by Atlantic Records. In August 2008, Jay-Z performed the Kanye West–produced song "Jockin' Jay-Z" during the latter's Glow in the Dark Tour.
Commercial performance.
The album debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 chart with first-week sales of 476,000 copies. It serves as the third-highest first-week sales of 2009. It became Jay-Z's eleventh US number-one album, breaking the record he had previously shared with Elvis Presley. In its second week, it remained at number 1, selling another 301,000 units, before dropping to second in its third week. After four weeks sales totaled 1,104,000 units.
In the album's fifth week it sold 75,000 copies bringing the total to 1,178,000 it is Jay-Z's 11th solo album to go Platinum. The album in its fifth week is also number 5 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In its sixth week the album rose up 2 spots to number 3 on the "Billboard" 200, despite selling 65,000 copies, 10,000 less than its previous week. 53,000 copies were sold in the US in its seventh week, putting it at number 4 on the charts. In week eight the album sold 51,000 copies. In the next week album sold 48,000 units. In next three weeks album sold over 100,000 copies and, as of May 2010, its sales in the U.S. stand at 1,748,000 units. It is Jay-Z's first album to have 3 Hot 100 Top 10 Hits.
The album was the 9th best selling album of 2009 in the U.S., selling over 1.52 million copies in 4 months, the album is now at over 1.86 million sold and still in the Top 30. "The Blueprint 3" was the second highest selling hip-hop album of 2009 domestically.
It was the 5th Highest selling Rap Album of 2010 according to Billboard.
On the week ending July 29, 2012, "The Blueprint 3" re-entered the "Billboard" 200 at 28. It has sold 1,933,000 copies in the US to date.
Critical reception.
"The Blueprint 3" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 22 reviews. In his review for MSN Music, Robert Christgau called the album "fairly superb" and gave it an A- rating, indicating "the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction". Allmusic writer John Bush compared the album to its predecessors, describing it as "somewhere between the two, closer to the vitality and energy of the original but not without the crossover bids and guest features of the latter (albeit much better this time)". Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" commented that the album succeeds at its goal of "reaching maximum commercial blast radius while maintaining its street bona fides".
"The Daily Telegraph" gave the album four out of five stars and complimented its modern sound. "The A.V. Club" gave it a B+ rating and stated, "Jay-Z sounds liberated by his legacy rather than weighed down by expectations". Despite noting inconsistency in Jay-Z's rapping, Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" complimented the album's varied musical elements and called it "an unexpected blend of maturity and youth". Pete Cashmore of "NME" commented that it "delivers because of hefty beats and quality rapsmanship, nothing else. And, ultimately, that’ll do just fine". Kiilian Fox of "The Observer" commented that Jay-Z is "maturing into a responsible elder statesman". Zach Baron of "The Village Voice" viewed that "much of "Blueprint 3" is about the weird, meta-rap work of redefining what it is to be a boss" and stated "Jay-Z's midlife crisis is over. Which doesn't make "The Blueprint 3" a classic. But we'll take it. For now".
In a mixed review, Slant Magazine's William McBee found "The Blueprint 3" "predictable", "complacent", and "a hip-hop feast, for sure, filled to the brim with elite production and elite rapping, but it lacks the hungriness, the spirit, and the craziness that marks a classic album". "Rolling Stone"s Jody Rosen called it "a catchy, pop-friendly record", but viewed that it lacks the "electric charge" of Jay-Z's previous albums and that he is "stuck for a subject [...] But he says it well".<ref name="Rosen">Rosen, Jody.

Flag and coat of arms of Johor

The flag and the coat of arms of Johor are state symbols of Johor, Malaysia. Like other states of Malaysia with Malay royalties, the state symbols of Johor are influenced by Johor's royalties, as well as Islam and the political and natural features of the state.
Flag.
Johor's state flag bears a canton pattern, a predominantly navy blue design with a bright red field on the upper left canton (quarter), which contains a white crescent and a white five-pointed star. Running slightly less than half the length of the flag, the field unconventionally occupies roughly three fifths of the flag's hoist. In addition, the crescent is not aligned upright, tilting to the right towards the lower fly end and wrapping slightly around the star, which is positioned towards the lower right corner of the field.
The flag in general attempts to illustrate a Johor in a nutshell. The navy blue, which occupies roughly three quarters of the flag, represents the universe, or the state government. The red represents the warriors that defend the state, while the white crescent and white star denote Islam and Johor's sovereign ruler, respectively.
Variants.
The" vast majority of flags in use or formerly used by o"fficials and government branches in the state borrow elements of the state flag, some of which are merely recolours. With the introduction of a unified state flag, many of them became obsolete, with the exception of the Royal Standards.
Standards.
A series of Royal Standards are flown by the Sultan of Johor and his family, which lower-ranking members are assigned specific Standards. In addition, standards were also adopted for traditional high-ranking officials, including the "bendahara", the "Temenggung" and the Sultan's Marshall.
The Standards are typically plain flags with a star (of varying numbers of points) and crescent, with truncating triangles placed on each corner of the flag; only the Standards of the Sultan and the Crown Prince are depicted without the truncations. In addition, each flag, with the exception of the Sultan's Marshall, are coloured in only two colours, including white, blue, red and yellow. The number of points on the star also determines the rank of the Standard holder: The Sultan's Standard depicts a nine-pointed star, while the Standard for other members of the royal family depicts a five-pointed star.
The series of Standards include:
Flags of state officials.
As of 1939, flags were flown by numerous state officials in Johore, including the governing heads of state or district. The vast majority of flag consist of only a plain coloured flag with a five-pointed star and crescent similar to that from the state flag, with some divided diagonally "a la" party per bend. They include:
Maritime flags.
Ships operated by Johore state flew their own maritime flags for identification. Largely similar to the state flag, the flags are typically recolours of the state flag that displays a combination of three colours out of four: Black, red, white and blue. They include:
In addition, pennants were known to be flown, illustrated as a triangular flag containing the same five pointed star and crescent. The "State Officials' Pennant" was coloured blue with a white star and crescent, while another variant of unknown use was coloured yellow with a blue star and crescent.
Other variants.
Johore's police force was also known to fly its own flag, essentially similar in design as the flag of Johore, but with a different combination of colours: A red field with a black canton containing a white five-pointed star and crescent.
A ceremonial state flag was also flown, consisting of red flag with a white five-pointed star and crescent, an inner yellow border and an outer blue border.
Obsolete state flag.
The Johorean flag is known to date back as early as the 1850s, when a flag that consisted of a simple black flag with a white canton shaped as a square was flown by the Sultanate between 1855 and 1865. The design was also adopted by Trumong, in present day Indonesia.
Coat of arms.
Johor's coat of arms (Malay: "Jata Johor") derives its layout heavily from Western heraldry, consisting of a central shield topped by a helm, sided by two supporters, and includes a compartment and motto at the bottom. Details of the arms' elements are as followed:

Schloss Lieser

Schloss Lieser (Castle of Lieser) in the Mosel valley nearby Bernkastel-Kues is one of the most striking buildings within the village of Lieser, Germany.
History.
The castle was created on the site of a 1710-built church property.
Today's castle was designed by the architect Heinrich Theodor Schmidt in 1884–1887 as the residence for the family of the winery owner Eduard Puricelli. Eduard Puricelli founded and led several gas industries, including in Trier and also in the Rheinböller hut. Puricelli applied several times for Catholic and conservative parties to Members mandates and belonged to the constituent Reichstag of the North German Confederation. After the German-French war 1870/71 Puricelli continued for economic reasons, together with eleven other companies in Trier for the Annexation of Alsace-Lorraine.
Eduard Puricellis daughter Maria, sole heiress of parental possessions, married in 1880 the high Prussian officer Dr. Clemens Freiherr von Schorlemer-Alst/ Clemens Freiherr von Schorlemer-Lieser (1856–1922). Through its activities in the Prussian administrative services Clemens von Schorlemer made the acquaintance Kaiser Wilhelm II, who appreciated him.
In 1895/1904-1906 the castle was extended when Maria and Dr Clemens Freiherr von Schorlemer moved into the castle . 
The castle consists out of two components, the older part in forms of Neo-Renaissance and the younger part in the forms of Art Nouveau.
Outside.
The outside side is influenced by the Neo-Renaissance, but in outline – according to the architect – Neo-Gothic. The jewellery forms bays, gables and towers are oriented to the German forms of Late Renaissance. The entrance is protected by a tower were two free-standing granite columns rise. The Risalit/Avant-corps on the left side of the main facade is Risalit by large, spread over two floors, is emphasized. The Madonna statue at the corner near the chapel comes from Peter Fuchs, who also worked at the Cologne Cathedral. On the main facade there are representations from the fields of industry and agriculture. For the stone construction Mosel slates and red – on the ground floor – brighter "Udelfanger" sandstone where used. The roof has been made from the slate quarries of "Cauber Erbstollens".
Ground plan, ground floor and staircase.
The ground plan is located between the Mosel river and the mountains, so that all rooms within the building – as in English country houses - are along a corridor. The basic design of the building with the octagonal hall is based on Italian villas of the 16th (Palladio) and 17th centuries. 
The ground floor, in which mainly economic areas and the bottling plants were located, has been created very high for flood protection.
In the stairwell between eight large pilasters painted landscapes and architectural motifs from the Mosel region created by Karl Julius Grätz are located. The stairwell window with lead glazing has four painted medallions of Binsfeld and Janssen in Trier. The staircase itself is a self-construction of Trier sandstone with wrought-iron, partly gilded railings.
First floor.
The first floor is a Beletage with representation rooms. In the octagonal hall, where the stairs end, the sculptor's work, the pillars and the wall panelling have been created in light Burgreppacher sandstone. The ceiling has been plastered and contains several paintings. The first floor contains the rather sober work room, reception room, with pitch pine and oak wood-panelled dining room large with a rich and carved wooden ceiling and several doorframes, the small dining room for everyday use, a poolroom, several garden rooms, guest rooms and a kitchen.
Second floor.
The second floor is the private sector of the house. Is had been equipped with livingrooms, sleepingrooms, tourist rooms and rooms for servants. It also contains a wall table and a marble fireplace. The copper plate of the fireplace has been decorated with a presentation of Hubert Salentin from Düsseldorf.
Chapel.
The hall of Beletage links to the chapel, which is a building on its own. The wallpaintings are by Karl Julius Grätz. The glass paintings are by Binsfeld and Janssen. Peter Fuchs created the saint statues. The mosaic floor with his figural representations was designed by the architect and produced in Mettlach.
The statue of the "housewife" and the other facilities.
A special feature of the paintings is the image originally situated on the terrace sculpture of the wife of the owner. With her old German costume, keys and wallet in hand, it symbolizes allegorical excessive. 
The carpentry work, furniture and other equipment details were drawings of the architects of Epple and Ege in Stuttgart. From the company M. Armbruster in Frankfurt the construction locks and art metalwork were created.
The extension of 1895/1904-1906.
It is unclear whether the extension of the castle was created in 1904–1906, or already built in 1895 — the information differs. The historicism here takes the form of Art Nouveau. The main pavilion is a mid-wing, which served as a wintergarden. In front of the central axis of the three-pavilion construction a "three-Söller" has been placed. The entrance to a building along is followed by a concrete tower. Inside the extended building is in one of the two staircases, an Art Nouveau railing.

West Head

West Head is the name of three separate headlands on New Zealand's South Island.
The third of these is the easternmost point of the South Island, and should not be confused with West Cape, the westernmost point of the South Island. West Head marks the western side of the entrance to Tory Channel, and the corresponding East Head is located on Arapawa Island.
Easternmost Point of South Island.
West Head, at the entrance to Tory Channel, is the easternmost point of the South Island. However, two other distinct headlands have very similar longitudes, sometimes leading to confusion and erroneous claims.
West Head, at the entrance to Tory Channel, is recorded by Land Information New Zealand as longitude 174.3154°E, and the easternmost tip is measured at 174.3157°E (174°18'57"E).
Cape Jackson, LINZ longitude 174.3134°E, easternmost tip measured at 174.3150°E (174°18'54"E), is about 100 metres further west.
Both West Head and Cape Jackson are at the end of long, narrow and difficult-to-reach peninsulas in the Marlborough Sounds. For this reason third-place Cape Campbell, LINZ longitude 174.2760°E, easternmost tip 174.2773°E (174°16'34") is sometimes mistakenly considered the easternmost point, but is about three kilometres further west.
Note that LINZ coordinates may refer to a prominent feature such as a hill top, while easternmost tips are measured on Wikimapia. There may also be discrepancies between coordinate systems used by different sources.

Picture Claire

Picture Claire is a 2001 thriller film directed by Bruce McDonald of a screenplay by Semi Chellas. The film stars Juliette Lewis, Gina Gershon, Callum Keith Rennie, Kelly Harms, Camilla Rutherford, Peter Stebbings, and Mickey Rourke. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, and also appeared at Cinéfest in Sudbury, where the film received Best Ontario Feature Award. 
Lewis stars as Claire Beaucage, who gets in way over her head when she's in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Plot.
Claire (Juliette Lewis) is a woman from Quebec who gets in trouble with the vengeful heroin dealers she helped finger. They retaliate by burning her out of her apartment. Frightened and in need of refuge, she heads to Toronto for to stay with ex-lover photographer Billy Stuart (Kelly Harms). She speaks only French, she understands little English and speaks even less, she finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time all too often. Claire 
has difficulties finding Billy but continues her search for him as the cops continue to search for her. She finally finds his gallery along with some photographs that he had taken of her in her sleep, he knew she hated having her picture taken. The exhibition of his work is opening and it seems to consist mostly of pictures of her.
Mickey Rourke played sleazy gangster Eddie and Gina Gershon portrays his tough-as-nails moll Lily Warden.
Production.
Mostly filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. During location filming on a Toronto street, a woman was arrested for causing a disturbance after the filmmakers called for silence and she refused to stop blowing a whistle. Segments of the film were shot in Kensington Market, including inside Shampoo Hair Studio on St. Andrew St., which was rented and converted to look like a donut shop.
Reception.
Intended to be released to theaters, the film never found a distributor, so "Picture Claire" was ultimately released direct-to-video or premiered on television like in Netherlands. Reviews for Picture Claire were mixed, but mostly negative. Jason Gorber from "Filmfest.ca" stated that "Bruce McDonald directs a mostly American cast in a staunch Toronto film." and gave it "fresh" rating. Film Rated R for violence, language and nudity by MPAA. Film's working title was "Claire's Hat"
Overall, people who watched the film found this movie "Great acting amazing film with Potential of Cult-Movie"
"Claire's Hat".
Named after the original title of the film, McDonald created a documentary film about how he thought the film was a failure, where he said "I fucked up my own movie". Using stolen footage and outtakes from the film, he presented a DVD commentary style description of the shooting process, his arguments with his producer and his disappointment with himself to allow others to convince him to influence the film. The documentary has had rare screenings and was passed along to friends and some independent rental houses in Toronto.

Hecatera dysodea

The Small Ranunculus "(Hecatera dysodea)" is a moth of the family Noctuoidea. It is found in Europe, primarily in Central Europe and Southern Europe and from Algeria and Morocco up to Turkestan. It is an introduced species in North America, where it was first found in Utah in 1998 and Oregon in 2005.
The wingspan is 32–34 mm. The length of the forewings is 14–15 mm. The moth flies in one generation from May to mid August. . Their cocoons typically hatch during the month of June when the humidity levels increase. Notably, during the first three months after they hatch, due to a genetic defect they can only turn to the left while flying. If they want to go to the right, they must land and turn on the ground.
The larvae feed on flowers and seeds of Compositae species, especially "Lactuca" species.

Transportation of animals

The transportation of animals is the movement of animals by transport. Common categories of animals which are transported include livestock destined for sale or slaughter; zoological specimens; laboratory animals; race horses; pets; and wild animals being rescued or relocated. Methods of transporting animals vary greatly from species to species.
History.
Humans have been transporting animals for a variety of purposes for thousands of years, with numerous accounts of animal transportation from the ancient world. Animals were transported for Roman circuses and for use as military animals. Two well-known historical examples of animals transported to foreign countries are Hanno the elephant and Dürer's Rhinoceros.
Later, animals were transported from the New World to Europe for study and introduction.
During the 20th century, the transportation of animals has focussed on the movement of animals for food, research, entertainment and conservation and the transport of animals is regulated in many countries. Such transport is regulated by a guideline by the European Council enacted in 2007, with relevant legislation passed in member countries, including England, through the Welfare of Animals (Transport), Order 2006 ("WATEO 2006"); and "equivalent national legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland". The Animal Transportation Association was formed in 1976 by interested parties to develop best practices and provide information to those involved in the shipment of animals.
Livestock.
Livestock destined for sale or slaughter, race horses, and pets are frequently transported. It is important to avoid injury and death of the animal during transportation.
Research animals.
The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Research Council has produced guidelines for the transportation of research animals.
Zoo animals.
Wild animals are often transported for display in zoos. Some wild animals offer specific challenges.
Elephants.
Elephants are regularly transported for circuses and as working animals but are less regularly transported between zoos. Historically, war elephants were transported from their native countries to battlefields throughout the ancient world. Ptolemy II Philadelphus, in the 3rd century BCE, had ships custom-built for the purpose.
Elephants employed by circuses were historically transported in Circus trains.
In modern times, the transportation of elephants has often been contentious. In 2013, the CEO of Toronto Zoo stated that "whatever the mode of transport is, ground, air, rail, there are associated risks with moving elephants". The zoo had been unable to finalise a determination about the mode of transport for three elephants to a sanctuary in California. Another Toronto Zoo board member noted that if an elephant panics during air transport, "it may have to be euthanized".
Giraffes.
Giraffes are typically transported in custom-built containers or crates to account for their height.
In 2013, Nakuru, a 15-month-old female giraffe, was transported from New Zealand to Melbourne in Australia. Her specialised 4.2 metre crate was transported by sea on a cargo ship. As is required by Australian law, Nakaru was quarantined for 30 days at the Werribee Open Range Zoo before being moved again by truck to Melbourne Zoo approximately 30 kilometres away.
Earlier in 2013, Tonda, a 4.3-metre, three-year-old adult male, was moved from Paignton Zoo to Chessington Zoo, both in England. The 322-kilometre move was completed by a Dutch company that specialises in animal transportation using a specially built trailer with an adjustable roof.
Lions.
Lions present particular transportation challenges because of their size and the danger they pose to humans. To transport two lions from Morocco to Germany, one specialist animal transportation company elected to move the animals by land, travelling via Gibraltar, Spain and France, rather than by air. The vehicle they used was extensively modified with new suspension and shock absorbers.
In 2013, a South African zoologist received media attention for having transported 27 lions, mostly adult, in his Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van to relocate them from one wildlife park to another.
Tapirs.
Though they are related to the horse and rhinoceros, tapirs are regulated as pachyderms by the United States Department of Agriculture for the purpose of transportation and import. One issue with the transporting of tapirs is that young tapirs must not be separated from their mother for the first year of their lives – and as tapirs must be separated from other tapirs in order to transport them, it can be very difficult to transport a young or baby tapir.
In 2008, a three-year-old tapir, Romeo, was transported from Costa Rica to Nashville, Tennessee. Romeo was the first animal to leave the country legally and the first tapir to be transported to the United States in more than 20 years. A specially-constructed cage was used to transport the tapir on a cargo plane and the move itself was supervised by staff from the Nashville Zoo.
In 2013, Timmy, a 400-pound Baird's tapir who had suffered from ear infections, was sent by FedEx from Florida to Los Angeles as part of a breeding programme. He was kept in quarantine for 30 days after his trip.
Aquarium animals.
There are two techniques for moving large marine mammals – wet transit, in which the animal is kept in a large tank of water, and dry transit, in which the animal is placed in a padded sling and kept calm, wet, and cool by human assistance. The decision whether to use wet or dry transit will depend on the size of the animal being transported and the distance to be traveled.
Killer whales.
The transportation of killer whales (orca) was a key feature of the popular film Free Willy. Keiko, who played the role of Willy in the film, was moved using a trailer - although when he was actually transported to the Oregon Coast Aquarium, he was airlifted by the United Parcel Service. When he was transported to the Westman Islands in Iceland in 1998, he was loaded onto a U.S. Air Force C-17 transport.
Other whales.
The largest animal ever transported was J.J., a young grey whale who weighed and was long. She was fitted into a custom-made transport sling and lifted by crane onto a 40-foot foam-padded trailer, before being released, again by crane, just off Point Loma. FedEx has shipped at least seven whales to aquariums in slings inside of metal containers containing just enough water to keep the whales moist.
Seals.
Transporting seals is considered to be easier than transporting cetaceans, since seals are semiaquatic and able to tolerate long periods out of water, as long as they are kept cool and moist. Cooling of the transported seal can be carried out by using a water spray, or placing ice above the seal's container which cools the seal as it melts.
Transportation of domestic pets.
By air.
Airlines vary in their policies on the transport of domestic pets, with some allowing pets in the passenger cabin and others insisting that they are transported in the same compartments as baggage, mail and other cargo. These compartments may be pressurized and may be maintained in a constant temperature range. The American Ferret Association, for example, offers advice on the policies of nineteen different carriers.
Passports.
In 2004 a change in EU law meant that as well as cats and dogs, ferret transportation was allowed within European Union borders.
Currently the EU pet passport scheme only covers cats, dogs and ferrets that have been vaccinated against rabies and fitted with electronic microchips. As of yet, there is no EU wide legislation to cover transportation of other pets, with different member states applying various rules.

Academic quarter (year division)

An academic quarter refers to the division of an academic year into four parts, found in a minority of universities in the United States and in some European and Asian countries. 
Background and trends.
In the United States, quarters typically comprise 10 weeks of class instruction, although they have historically ranged from eight to 13 weeks. Academic quarters first came into existence as such when William Rainey Harper organized the University of Chicago on behalf of John D. Rockefeller in 1891. Harper decided to keep the school in session year-round and divide it into four terms instead of the then-traditional two.
Of the four traditional academic calendars (semester, quarter, trimester, and 4-1-4), the semester calendar is used the most widely, at over 60% of U.S. higher learning institutions, with fewer than 20% using the quarter system. This number has stayed fairly constant since 1930, when 75% of U.S. institutions surveyed indicated they used a semester plan, with 22% on the quarter system.
During the 1960s, a number of U.S. statewide educational systems made a switch from a semester to quarter system, typically in an attempt to accommodate the Tidal Wave I enrollment boom, most prominently the University of California system. Since then, UC Berkeley switched back to semesters in 1983, the new UC Merced branch opened with the semester system, and some UC professional schools have switched back to semesters at various points. At various points since, committees have been established and official discussions have taken place within the UC system to discuss a systemwide switch back to the semester system.
In recent years, a number of higher education institutions have considered or already approved a switch to a semester system including the higher education systems of Ohio and Georgia, and individual public colleges. Rochester Institute of Technology has announced their intention to convert to semesters by Fall 2013, although the decision is highly controversial, overriding a student vote to remain with quarters.
Arguments.
Concerns over the quarter system include faculty dislike of the brevity of the term, the loss of faculty research and collaboration time, the shortness of student internship periods, difficulties in recovering from illness-linked absence, and the heavy administrative workload.
A quarter system calendar also may put schools at a disadvantage in competing for prospective students, who wish to keep in-step with friends, and offer more opportunities for students to "disconnect from school."
Quarter systems do allow students to enroll in a richer variety of courses and school-coordinated internships and may encourage students to take on double majors, minors, concentrations, and the like.
A quarter system can maximize the use of college facilities in a time of enrollment growth, as it allows for four regular periods of academic instruction. Also, quarters allow for faculty to engage in terms with a relatively light course load of teaching and greater opportunities for short sabbaticals.

Psagot

Psagot (, "lit." Peaks) is a communal Israeli settlement in the West Bank located north of Jerusalem on Tawil hill adjacent to Ramallah, al-Bireh, and Kokhav Ya'akov. Psagot, established in 1981, falls under the jurisdiction of Binyamin Regional Council, with the council's headquarters located there. In 2008 it had a population of 1,623.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
Etymology.
The name Psagot was proposed by one of the early residents, Moshe Bar-Asher, a professor and head of The Academy of the Hebrew Language. It expresses the hope that the new village will achieve a peak in settlement and study of the Torah. The name also refers to the location of Psagot on the peak of Mount Tawil.
History.
The Arabic name of the hill is Jabel Tawil (long mountain).
Before 1967, Jabel Tawil was known to locals as "Kuwaiti hill" because of numerous visitors from the Persian Gulf who hiked in the area. In 1964, some of the land was purchased by the Jerusalem municipality for a future tourist resort. In the Six-Day War, it came under Israeli control. From September 1976, Arabs were prohibited from building in the area.
In 1981, Ariel Sharon, then Israeli Minister of Defense, told Pinchas Wallerstein, head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, that he would support initiatives to settle the area. In July 1981, Wallerstein moved the council headquarters to the hill, then occupied by a military intelligence base. Five families from the Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit VeGan took up residence there. A year later, they were joined by a group from the Kerem B'Yavneh yeshiva who came to create a kollel.
Arab–Israeli conflict.
According to B'Tselem, Psagot prevents the expansion of Ramallah and cuts it off from the surrounding villages. During the course of the Second Intifada, snipers shot at Psagot from buildings in Ramallah, leading to the construction of a concrete wall to protect the inhabitants. In 2001, the Israeli army stationed nearby fired two missiles into Ramallah targeting Marwan Barghouti.
In November 2009, the Psagot settlement and the advocacy group Regavim petitioned the High Court of Justice in an unsuccessful attempt to stop construction of the Al-Bireh International Stadium, citing security concerns.
The Sasson Report identified Psagot as the "parent settlement" of an Israeli outpost known as Mitzpe Ha'ai located approximately 400m to the southeast. According to the report, the settlement, unauthorized by the government, was built on land appropriated illegally from its Palestinian owners. According to Peace Now 75.69% of the combined area of Psagot and Mitzpe Ha'ai is on appropriated private land.
Status under international law.
The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them. This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Economy.
The Psagot Winery was founded by Na’ama and Yaakov Berg, who planted vineyards in 1998. In addition to a modern barrel cellar, some of the oak barriques are stored in a cave dating back to the Second Temple era. The winery’s top wine is a Bordeaux blend named Edom. Regular varietal wines are produced in the Psagot series and there is also a Port-style wine. In 2007 and 2008, the winery produced 65,000 bottles annually. In 2010, the winery produced 80,000 bottles of wine a year, the majority for export. Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews work there side by side, creating an island of co-existence in sea of mistrust. The American evangelical Christian organization HaYovel has sent volunteers to tend and harvest Psagot Winery's vineyards. Berg says calls to boycott his wines have only increased demand. Other wineries exist around Psagot, and the Yesha Council hopes to make them a tourist attraction. According to the local Palestinians and the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din, the wineries are partially planted on privately owned Palestinian land.

Online art gallery

An online version of a contemporary art gallery.
Purpose and Type of Online Art Galleries.
An online art gallery refers to a website that display artworks. Usually, the online gallery is run as a business, with the purpose of displaying the artwork being to promote it to potential buyers. Other variations include:
Viewing Art Online.
Viewing art online is an improving experience. Ideally, art should appear exactly as it would if seen in the real world, but there are factors that limit the extent to which this is possible. Factors include:
The increased adoption of broadband, and improvement in web programming techniques opens up the opportunity for improved display of art online. Whilst no online gallery yet uses light filtering effects, and 3d photography is not yet available, much richer images and improved display techniques provide the viewer with a much richer experience.
The viewer may be offered the option of zooming such that the texture or pigmentation may be examined. Also in some cases the size of the work can be better appreciated by showing it alongside an image of a person of average height.
Another advantage of Online Galleries is that the art buying public is broadening but people are still somewhat intimidated by most commercial Art Galleries. They think they know nothing about art and I believe that in some cases this disadvantages the sales of some artists. If the potential buyer has access to a wide range of art that they can view in the comfort and safety of their own home they will tend to look a bit deeper and get to know what and who they like.
Associated Facilities.
Online galleries often form part of a wider online operation, with other popular facilities including:

L'attaque du moulin

"L'attaque du moulin" ("The Attack on the Mill") is a "drame lyrique" (opera) in four acts by the French composer Alfred Bruneau. The libretto, by Louis Gallet with the collaboration of Émile Zola, is based on a short story by Zola (included in the collection "Les soirées de Médan"). Zola's story is about the Franco-Prussian War, but the setting of the opera was changed to the period of the French Revolution.
Performance history.
"L'attaque du moulin" was first performed on 23 November 1893 by the Opéra-Comique at the former Théâtre Lyrique (the present Théâtre de la Ville) on the Place du Châtelet in Paris. The "mise en scène" was by Léon Carvalho, the scenery by Marcel Jambon, and the costumes by Théophile Thomas. The original production was performed a total of 39 times.
The Gaîté Lyrique revived the opera on 16 December 1907, and the Opéra-Comique, on 25 March 1922 (14 performances). By 1917 the opera had been presented outside of France in eleven different cities, including Brussels (27 January 1894), London (4 July 1894, at the Covent Garden theatre), Breslau (5 November 1805, in German), Geneva (11 December 1896), Milan (8 January 1898, at the Teatro Lirico, in Italian), The Hague (November 1903), Barcelona (7 January 1909), New York (8 February 1910), New Orleans (19 January 1911), Vienna (13 March 1914, at the Volksoper, in German), Birmingham (15 October 1915, in English), and again London (18 May 1917, at the Garrick Theatre, in English).

Greek-Latvian relations are the bilateral relations between Greece and Latvia. Both countries are full members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, of NATO and the European Union. The Latvian embassy in Athens was established in 1998. Latvia also has two honorary consulates in Piraeus and in Thessaloniki. The Greek embassy in Riga was opened in January 2005. 
History.
Greece recognized the State of Latvia on May 23, 1922. Relations between the two countries were disrupted by World War II, which saw Latvia occupied briefly by Germany and then for a longer period by the Soviets. Latvia's return to independence was recognized by Greece on August 27, 1991; followed by the restoration of diplomatic relations on September 2, 1991. Greece has never officially recognized the annexation of the Baltic states by the USSR.

Adei Ad

Adei Ad (, "lit." For Always) is an Israeli outpost in the West Bank. It is near Shvut Rachel and Qusra and falls under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. 
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
History.
Adei Ad was established in 1998 by a group of students at the Sdor Amir yeshiva in Shvut Rachel. In 1999 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered the outpost dismantled.
It was established on land privately owned by Palestinians and was therefore considered illegal even under Israeli law, although the ownership was disputed by the settlers. In 2003 the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the land was owned by the state of Israel. The Israeli government, however, claimed that, despite its being state-owned, the settlers had no right to build there.
In June 2003 the Israeli Defense Forces (IFD) deployed paratroopers to blockade Adei Ad while it was dismantled. An IDF officer asked to be excused from participating in the blockade and was advised by his commanding officer that he could participate indirectly by briefing other soldiers involved in the operation. He refused this order as well and was subsequently jailed. The High Court of Justice temporarily enjoined this dismantling operation and Binyamin Regional Council leader Pinhas Wallerstein accused the Israeli government of scheduling the dismantling of the outpost to coincide with a visit to Israel of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in order to show its commitment to the ongoing peace process.
Israeli news sources reported in 2003 that although the Israeli government was following its policy of dismantling them, it was simultaneously funding the construction of illegal outposts, including Adei Ad. 
Adei Ad was the beneficiary of agricultural aid from Mishmeret Yesha, which by 2008 had cleared large areas of land around the outpost and planted them in grapes.
In July 2008 soldiers from the IDF demolished an illegal structure in Adei Ad. This led to retaliatory attacks on the IDF by settlers, which prompted the IDF Central Command to prohibit Israeli cars from entering parts of the West Bank for two days to prevent militant right-wing Israelis from joining in the violence. The IDF accused the then mayor of Kedumim, Daniella Weiss, of orchestrating and encouraging the settler violence.
In July 2009 soldiers from the IDF demolished a single caravan in Adei Ad, prompting settlers from Kedumim to attack the IDF with stones, injuring one. Five settlers were arrested in this incident. Retaliation for the home demolitions continued with further incidents of rock throwing and the burning of Palestinian-owned olive trees.
Population.
As of July 2009 the population of Adei Ad was about 20 families.

George Boulton Mainwaring

George Boulton Mainwaring was a Tory MP for Middlesex, a position that had also been held by his father William Mainwaring.
Mainwaring is thought to have been born in 1773. He was the son of William Mainwaring.
In the 1802 general election, William was opposed by the radical Francis Burdett. William had previously resisted Burdett's calls for an inquiry into Prison abuses, particularly at Coldbath Fields Prison. William was defeated by Burdett but the election was declared void in 1804 and, in the following contest, George was elected. The result was reversed in favour of Burdett in 1805 and then back in favour of George in 1806. Mainwaring did not contest the 1807 election and Burdett was not elected. The National Portrait Gallery has a caricature which includes Mainwaring that pokes fun at the 1804 election.
In 9 June 1804, Mainwaring married Letitia Wodehouse.

Esh Kodesh

Esh Kodesh (, lit. "Sacred Fire") is an Israeli outpost in the West Bank near Shilo. It falls under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. The population in 2005 was under 12 families.
History.
Esh Kodesh was founded in 2000 near Shvut Rachel, one of several such settlements in the area. It was named for a terrorist victim, Esh Kodesh Gilmore, 25, who was murdered by Palestinian gunmen while working as a security guard at a branch of the National Insurance Institute in East Jerusalem. "Esh Kodesh" is also a book of sermons delivered by the Admor of Piaseczno in the Warsaw Ghetto from the outbreak of World War II on September 1, 1939 until July 1942, when the Jews of the ghetto were deported to the death camp at Treblinka.
The residents of Esh Kodesh earn a living from vineyards and goat-herding. To meet the security challenges of living in an area where their presence generates hostility, they have undergone Mishmeret Yesha self-defense training.
In September 2011, in the wake of the Palestinian Authority's plans to request unilateral recognition at the United Nations leading to expectations of unrest, the Israel Defense Forces established a base near Esh Kodesh On September 23, 2011, Israeli security forces were called in to break up a clash between the settlers and a group of 300 villagers from Qusra. Due to the growing tension, residents of Qusra armed with flashlights and sticks began to patrol the perimeter of their village at night to thwart possible incursions by Esh Kodesh settlers.
In 2010, the Israeli Supreme Court sentenced a resident of Esh Kodesh, the son of Orit Struk, head of the Human Rights Organization of Judea and Samaria, to 18 months in prison for the kidnapping and assault of a Palestinian teenager.
On January 5th, 2013, approximately 200 Palestinians cut through the fences of the vineyard and attacked the vineyards and residents of Esh Kodesh. 12 outpost residents were injured, with one taken to the hospital. The vineyards were destroyed, a security vehicle was damaged and the attackers neared homes before the military arrived. The incident was part of a continuing dispute between the Esh Kodesh settlers and nearby Palestinians over land ownership.

Greece–Nigeria relations

Greece–Nigeria relations include diplomatic and economic relations between Greece and Nigeria. Nigeria has an embassy in Athens. Greece established a diplomatic mission in Nigeria in 1970, and today has an embassy in Abuja and a consulate in Lagos. Trade between the two countries is imbalanced, with imports from Greece to Nigeria exceeding exports. Greek-owned tankers have an important role in shipping Nigerian oil and natural gas, its main exports. Recently a Greek tanker was involved a dispute over crude oil smuggling. Greek-controlled companies have invested US$5 billion in the Nigerian economy. There is a small Greek business community in Lagos.
Official relations.
Greece and Nigeria enjoyed close ties before the Nigerian military regime took power in December 1983. In February 2000, the Nigerian embassy in Greece was re-established after a 16-year absence. Relationships between the countries are now generally good. On March 25, 2009, the outgoing Greek Ambassador to Nigeria, Haris Dafaranos, stated that Greece would continue to explore new areas of cooperation and boost cultural, economic, scientific and technological ties with Nigeria. This was confirmed when, on 22 April 2009, Greek Deputy FM Petros Doukas and visiting Nigerian Commerce and Industry Minister Charles Ugwuh signed a bilateral agreement in the economic, scientific and technology sectors. Ugwuh said "it is important, following a century of transactions between Greece and Nigeria, that an official agreement (on cooperation) was signed today". The two countries are discussing partnership in the development of the Free Trade Zones in Nigeria.
Trade and investment.
With the return to democracy in 2000, trade between the two countries is growing fast. The Hellenic African Chamber of Commerce and Development holds annual conferences where Greek businesses involved in African trade discuss opportunities with ministers and delegations from Nigeria and other countries. By 2003 Greek exports to Nigeria totalled US$46.5 million, with imports totaling US$5.4 million. By 2005, Greece exports had risen to €65.7 million, with imports of €20.2 million. Greek investments in Nigeria today exceed US$5 billion, and are growing. For example, in 2005 the Greek owned Flour Mills of Nigeria announced an investment of US$350 million to create a cement factory in Calabar. Estimated project costs have risen and are now in excess of US$500 million 
According to a report on "Trafficking in Persons" issued by the United States Department of State in 2008, Nigerian women and girls are trafficked to Europe for the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation, most notably to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Norway, and Greece. Approximately 10% of prostitutes in Greece are estimated to be from Nigeria, most of whom are victims of the slave trade.
Shipping.
In 2007 Nigeria had about 8.3% of the world market in natural gas exports, and was exporting about of oil using tankers, although volumes have been declining due to civic unrest and reduced demand. As of 2007, Greek-owned companies owned about 18% of the world fleet. The ships are registered under a variety of flags, including "flags of convenience", but with changing regulations an increasing number of Greek-owned tankers are registered under the Greek flag.
There are issues concerning the safety of Greek / Nigeria shipping. In November, 2008 the captain of an impounded Greek oil tanker accused Nigeria's armed forces of co-operating with militants in the Niger Delta to hijack his ship. The captain claimed that the militants had forced his crew at gun-point to load smuggled oil while three Nigerian naval gunboats looked on. Nigeria denied the allegation. Thirteen Filipino crew members of the oil tanker were arrested by the Nigerian government on suspicion of stealing thousands of tons of crude oil. Following kidnappings and other problems with workers on Greek vessels in the Nigerian coastal trade, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration has issued warnings to Filipino seafarers working on such vessels.
Movement of people.
Greeks in Nigeria.
Large Greek-owned companies have been operating in Nigeria for decades, such as the Mandilas Group, Nigeria Flour Mills and the Anglo-Hellenic multinational Patterson-Zochonis. The Leventis Group of Companies, trading in merchandise in West Africa, was founded in the 1930s by the Cypriot Anastasios George Leventis. By the time of his death in October 1978 it was one of the largest enterprises and one of the two largest employers in Nigeria. The Leventis Foundation, established by A.G. Leventis, has been active since 1979 with its main goal the training of young farmers in modern agricultural methods.
There were more than 10,000 Greeks living and working in Nigeria before the Nigerian military regime took power in December 1983, many of whom left the country. Today the Greek Diaspora in Nigeria numbers about 300 mostly residing in Lagos and working as company executives in large Greek-Nigerian companies. A Greek Orthodox holy bishopric operates in Nigeria, based in Lagos.
Nigerians in Greece.
In 2001 there were about 3,000 Nigerians in Greece, about half of whom live in Athens. Some came to Greece as university students, while others are economic migrants. The Nigerian Community of Greece (NCG) organization was created in 1990 to help new Nigerian immigrants gain legal status, and to provide a social network for Nigerian residents.

Monthly income preferred stock

Monthly income preferred stock or MIPS is a hybrid security created by Eli Jacobson, a Sullivan & Cromwell tax partner, and introduced to the market by Goldman Sachs in 1993. In essence, MIPS is a combination of deeply subordinated debt and preferred stock.
MIPS is structured in such a way as to make payments on the security an interest expense for the borrower and dividend for the lender. A special purpose entity of the issuer sells the preferred stock to the public and then lends the proceeds to the parent. The parent's interest payments to the subsidiary are tax deductible as interest and are used by the SPE to pay preferred dividends to the investors. However, the interest income received by the SPE is not taxable income, because it is organized as a tax-free entity.
Because of these features, MIPS at one point dominated the market for traditional perpetual preferred equity, accounting for over 70% of all new preferred issues. However, MIPS as a tax shelter no longer works. The credit rating agencies consider MIPS to be preferred stock.

Mitzpe Hagit (, lit. "Hagit Lookout") is an Israeli outpost in the West Bank. Located near the settlement of Kfar Adumim, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. It is home to around 25 families.
The outpost was established in 1999 by families from Kfar Adumim, and was named after Hagit Zavitsky, a settler from Kfar Adumim who was killed in Wadi Qelt in 1997.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
History.
Mitzpe Hagit was founded in early 1999. It began with only two wooden caravans on a hill from Kfar Adumim. On October 12, 1999, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced that Mitzpe Hagit was one of 15 outposts in the West Bank that he planned, on the recommendation of the Israeli Defense Ministry, to have dismantled. Barak gave the residents 14 hours to appeal.
In November 1999, Pinhas Wallerstein, head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, said that residents of Mitzpe Hagit would voluntarily leave the site until the outpost was officially authorized by the Israeli government.
By the end of December 1999 Mitzpe Hagit had been removed. Peace Now issued a report claiming that the Israeli government had approved new caravans there and in other dismantled outposts. The organization stated that this "testified to the continuation of under-the-table doings in everything linked to building in in the settlements."
Ephraim Sneh, Deputy Defense Minister at the time, said that his office was not planning to approve any building permits and that " Erez and Hagit were removed; they can submit plans to build but it doesn't mean anything. Therefore the movement shouldn't confuse the public."
By October 2000 settlers had returned to Mitzpe Hagit. There were again two caravans and the population was 8 adults and 4 children. Shimon and Chaya Ben Dor, who had been among the original founders, claimed that their return had the approval of Ehud Barak. Israeli officials, though, were unsure if this was true.

The Khroma River is a river in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) of the Russian Federation. It crosses the tundra roughly northeastwards and flows into Khromskaya Bay which is connected with the East Siberian Sea. Owing to its extreme northerly location the Khroma River freezes up in early October and remains icebound until June.
Wetlands.
The Kytalyk Wetlands, located between the Khroma and the Sundrun River (Khroma-Sundrun Interfluvial Area) is an ecologically important area, providing a favorable habitat for many rare animals. The region is practically uninhabited and full of lakes and marshes. Wild reindeer, Siberian cranes, Canadian cranes, marsh sandpipers and Ross's gulls are abundant in the Khroma River wetlands.
The lesser white-fronted goose
, Brent goose, Bewick's swan and the spectacled eider are also found in the Khroma-Sundrun Interfluvial Area.
Gold and tin mining upriver are affecting the ecology of the region by destroying fish and bird habitat.

Jan Van Eyck Academie

The Jan van Eyck Academie is a post-academic institute for research and production in the fields of fine art, design and art theory, based in Maastricht, Netherlands. The academy was established in 1948 and is named after the painter Jan van Eyck. In 2013, 39 researches from countries around the world were working and studying at the institutes premises in Jekerkwartier. In 2012, the Hubert van Eyck Academie was established as a 'teaching bridge', linking the Jan van Eyck Academy with Maastricht University and other Maastricht art schools.
History.
Beginnings (1947–1949).
In 1928 the priest Leo Linssen, the architect Alphons Boosten and the artist-writer Jan Engelman discussed the state of art in the province of Limburg, and the need for an art academy in the south of the Netherlands based on Roman Catholic principles. However, their ideas did not materialize at the time. Nearly two decades later, in December 1947, the Saint Bernulphus Foundation succeeded in establishing an institute for advanced education in fine art based on Catholic principles in Maastricht. The institute is named after the painter Jan van Eyck, born in Maaseik, not far from Maastricht, and considered a suitable role model for Catholic artists. The academy in Maastricht was originally conceived as a Catholic counterpart of the non-denominational Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, founded in 1870. The institute's main objectives were to further and expand art education in the broadest sense of the word, although the deed also clearly stipulated that the students should be trained in their art practice for tasks in the service of the Catholic Church, which involved the reconstruction, restoration and decoration of churches destroyed in the war. The academy was established as a private institute, subsidized by the state, the province of Limburg and local authorities. 
On 13 May 1948, the feast of patron saint Servatius of Maastricht, the founding charter was signed by representatives of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, the Province of Limburg, the city of Maastricht, and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Roermond. This day has ever since been observed as the academy's "dies natalis". Classes started on 1 October 1948 with seven students enrolled; their numbers increased to fifteen in the course of the first academic year. Compulsory subjects included the history of art, iconography, theology and philosophy, liturgy, sources of Christian art, history of civilization and literature. However, the statement of principles stressed that contemporary art was vital as well to the academy's set-up. In November 1948, the priest Leo W. Linssen was assigned first director of the Jan van Eyck Academie. Linssen, in his opening speech referred to Van Eyck's "Ghent Altarpiece" as an example of 'Christian art'.
The Jan van Eyck Academie initially took up residence in the former Sepulchrine church and convent ("Bonnefantenklooster") in the Jekerkwartier neighbourhood in the center of Maastricht. The rather derelict building with sparse natural light was shared with several other institutions. In 1949 the board decided that, as an applied art institution, the academy should incorporate the training of architects. Consequently, three curricula were set up: architecture, sculpture and fine art (i.e. monumental and decorative painting). Belgian sculptor Oscar Jespers was professor of sculpting (1949-56). Classes of theory, aesthetics and technical education – with a firm scientific basis – were compulsory. There were studios for ceramics and glass art, mosaics, plaster casting and goldsmithing. In 1951 the Jan van Eyck Academie moved to a 17th-century orphanage in Lenculenstraat (later to house the Maastricht Academy of Dramatic Arts).
Identity building (1950-1967).
On 21 July 1952 the first group of 15 students graduated. In 1954, professor J.J.M. Timmers, an eminent art historian and director of the Bonnefanten Museum, was appointed the academy's second director. His major task was to find the academy a new, suitable building, as well as to bring the academy up to equal level with the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. Consultations concerning the latter soon ran aground because the board of governors insisted on the Jan van Eyck Academie remaining a private institute, based on catholic principles. Plans for a new building, designed by Modernist architect Frits Peutz were presented and approved. In June 1959 construction work began and in January 1961 staff and students moved into the new building – a building however that was but a third of the size of Peutz' original plan.
In 1965, Timmers resigned as director and was succeeded by Albert Troost. Teaching and advising staff by that time had changed considerably; ties with the Roman Catholic establishment had become looser and catholic principles were only moderately adhered to. Troost, together with Ko Sarneel, visited art institutes of higher education in Amsterdam, Antwerp, Düsseldorf and Brussels and studied their educational programs and methods. The two men drew a master plan that emphasized the Maastricht academy's need for a clear statement of principles and a well-founded program. Education from now on was to match developments in contemporary art practices. Education was restricted to fine art; architecture was no longer part of the curriculum. Entry requirements became more rigid, a fact-finding year was introduced, and more visiting lecturers were employed. The new adage was that art education should be more individually directed: the student, his consciousness and questions were to feature centrally. When in 1966 the Dutch Minister of Culture, Maarten Vrolijk, opened a new wing adjacent to the existing building, he praised the Academie for being outstandingly fitted out: there was a studio for metal working, a welding workshop, a carving studio, a foundry for bronze molding, a pottery kiln and means were provided to work with new synthetic materials.
Goal setting (1968-1979).
The Jan van Eyck Academie's third decade brought about some dramatic changes. Subsidies had gradually increased over the years and there was more room for education, research and experiment. The departments of monumental art and applied art closed. Society had become more secular and there was less demand for stained-glass windows, murals and mosaics (mainly for churches). In order for the students to be trained as all-round experts in fine art, divisions between various disciplines were abolished. In 1969 the departments of theater, design and mixed media were set up. These were multi-disciplinary departments and as such perfectly tied in with the idea of doing away with divisions between disciplines. Students of the mixed media department could make use of the timber workshop, the welding shop, the photo studio, the darkrooms, the silk-screen print shop, the audio and video studio, and the foundry to produce a single work of art, an installation, a performance or an action.
In the 1970s the idea took ground that an art institute should be a breeding ground for research and experiment, a sanctuary of innovation. After 1978, the institute, rather than a place of instruction, saw itself as a platform or workshop ('werkplaats'): a center where works of art are being manufactured, as well as a place for discussion, study and experiment. Accommodation, equipment, expert supervision and coaching were aimed to trigger new developments. Extra-curricular activities, work placements in the art milieu, and other projects reached beyond the Academie's community.
Internationalization (1980s).
In 1980, Ko Sarneel, became acting director and proposed a 5-year plan, which entailed an increase in the scope and quality of projects and manifestations for the public at large. Visual token of Sarneel's term of office are the round holes that still mark the building today. The artist John Körmeling, alumnus of Eindhoven University of Technology, transformed the building into an 'art factory' for twenty-four hours. The ribs and diagonals of this imaginary building were visualized within and through the existing one by means of laser beams that concurred high up in the sky.
Two years later, Ko Sarneel resumed his previous function as head of the mixed media department, and William Pars Graatsma became director. During his directorship the photography section became autonomous and an audio room and video studio were set up. When the Jan van Eyck Academie celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1988, architects Wiel Arets and Wim van den Bergh were asked by Mr Graatsma to translate the policy plan of the academy into architectural terms. 'Macchina Arte' was the name for the architectonic concept that was about a complex set of thoughts that converged in the concept of 'machine'. By this time, the Jan van Eyck Academie had truly become an international platform for art. The majority of advising researchers and students were from abroad and English had become the language of communication.
Three disciplines (1990s).
The 1991 policy plan of the academy's new director Jan van Toorn described the Jan van Eyck Academie as an international post-graduate art center with three disciplines: fine art, design and art theory. During this period individual freedom, discourse and the wider cultural context were emphasized. The horizontal organizational structure of the institute ensured mutual interchange and interaction in the disciplines of architecture, sculpture, photography, graphics, painting, video-audio and mixed media. The Jan van Eyck Academie in the 1990s can be described as a venue for practical and theoretical reflection on art and society that went beyond generally accepted values. 'Researchers' (no longer students!) were expected to have attained a practical and theoretical level that allowed them to make contributions to discussions, to do research and to engage in multi- and trans-disciplinary activities.
In 1992 a computer workshop was set up and in 1995 the Jan van Eyck Academie was connected to the internet. By this time, there were seven professional technical studios/workshops in the building: the audio and video studios, the computer workshop, the print shop, the photo studio, and workshops for graphics, wood and other materials. The media center, including the library and archives, was enlarged. New research programs were set up (Transcultural Studies and Design & Media).
In 1998 Marianne Brouwer, former curator of sculpture of the Kröller-Müller Museum, was appointed director. In the autumn of 1999 Simon den Hartog, former director of the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and founder of the Sandberg Institute, became acting director. Sue Golding was head of the Art Theory department from 1998 to 2003.
Post-academic institute (2000-now).
In 2000 Koen Brams was appointed director of the Jan van Eyck Academy. The institute's program, as indicated in the policy plan, was described as the sum of all research and production undertaken. A new artistic advisory structure was introduced: advising researchers of the three departments (fine art, design and art theory) carry out departmental tasks together. In every department a core team of advising researchers is active. They initiate and supervise research projects, but their tasks also include programming, selection, studio visits, lectures, seminars, presentations and institutional and policy matters. Since 2001 the academy's weekly program is accessible to the public; opening up the institute has invited more critical response.
The Jan van Eyck Academie today sees itself as a hotbed for talent development. Essential in the new organization is that the institute is an open meeting place for people: artists, thinkers, readers, curators, writers, designers, poets, dreamers, workers, and occasional passers-by. The institute offers high-standard artistic and technical advice in response to individual requirements. Researchers are invited to theorize, formulate and produce. Hallmark of research is its discursive character. The institute offers alternative views of research and production, for which a climate of involvement is paramount in which researchers, artistic and technical staff establish alliances, collaborations and networks that are both practical and conceptual. Researchers can make use of the facilities ('Labs') inside the institute: the Charles Nypels Lab (print shop), the Heimo Lab (sculpture), the Werner Mantz Lab (film, photography) and the Pierre Kemp Lab (library, archives).
After extensive renovations, the renewed building was reopened on March 27, 2013.
Hubert van Eyck Academie.
On 25 January 2012, the Hubert van Eyck Academie was established as a post-academic institution aiming to develop teaching facilities in partnership with the faculty of Cultural and Social Sciences of Maastricht University and three Maastricht branches of Hogeschool Zuyd (Zuyd University of Applied Sciences): the Maastricht Academy of Dramatic Arts, the Maastricht Academy of Music and the Maastricht Academy of Fine Arts. Hubert van Eyck was Jan’s elder brother and taught Jan how to use oil-based paint. Just as research and education went together in their case, the Jan and Hubert van Eyck Academies are striving for the same objective. The Jan van Eyck Academie stands for project development, the Hubert van Eyck Academie for teaching. Through the Hubert van Eyck Academie it will be possible to set up PhD tracks for artists, in partnership with the European Graduate School in Saas Fee (Switzerland). 
The collaboration between the various Maastricht art schools has already resulted in the "I-Arts" program of Maastricht University. In 2012, two I-Arts masters students spent a year at the Jan van Eyck Academie.

Raimondo di Sangro

Raimondo di Sangro, Prince of Sansevero (30 January 1710 – 22 March 1771) was an Italian nobleman, inventor, soldier, writer and scientist, best remembered for his reconstruction of the Chapel of Sansevero in Naples.
Early life.
The seventh Prince of Sansevero was born at Torremaggiore into a noble family. His father was Antonio, Duke of Torremaggiore, and his mother was Cecilia Gaetani of Aragon. His mother died shortly after his birth. From the age of ten he was educated at the Jesuit College in Rome.
Career.
In 1730, at the age of 20, he returned to Naples. He became a friend of Charles Bourbon, who became king of Naples in 1734, for whom he invented a waterproof cape. In 1744 he distinguished himself at the head of a regiment during the battle of Velletri, in the war between the Habsburgs and the Bourbons. While in command of the military he built a cannon out of lightweight materials which had a longer range than the standard ones of the time, and wrote a military treatise on the employment of infantry ("Manuale di esercizi militari per la fanteria") for which he was praised by Frederick II of Prussia. 
His real interests, however, were the studies of alchemy, mechanics and the sciences in general. Among his inventions were:
The Prince spoke several European languages, as well as Arabic and Hebrew. After returning to Naples he set up a printing press in the basement of his house where he printed both his own works and those of others, some of which he translated himself. As some of these were censored by the ecclesiastical authorities he also wrote anonymously. Some of his publications were clearly influence by Freemasonry, and he communicated with fellow masons such as the Scot Andrew Michael Ramsay, whose "Voyages of Cyrus" he translated and published, and the English poet Alexander Pope, whose "Rape of the Lock" he translated and published (although, due to condemnations by the Jesuits, he had to deny these activities). He was head of the Neapolitan masonic lodge until he was excommunicated by the Church, making an enemy of the Neapolitan cardinal Giuseppe Spinelli. The excommunication was later revoked by Pope Benedict XIV, probably on account of the influence of Raimondo's family.
Many legends grew up around his alchemical activities: that he could create blood out of nothing, that he could replicate the liquefaction of blood of San Gennaro, that he had people killed so that he could use their bones and skin for experiments. The Capella Sansevero was said to have been constructed on an old temple of Isis, and Raimondo was said to have been a Rosicrucian. To justify this, locals pointed to a massive statue of the God of the Nile, located just around the corner from Raimondo's home. To add to the sense of dread, Raimondo's family home in Naples, the Palazzo Sansevero, was the scene of a brutal murder at the end of the 16th century, when the composer Carlo Gesualdo caught his wife and her lover "in flagrante delicto", and hacked them to death in their bed.
The last years of his life were dedicated to decorating the Chapel of Sansevero with marble works from the greatest artists of the time, including Antonio Corradini, Francesco Queirolo and Giuseppe Sanmartino, and preparing anatomical models. These models are still on display in the Chapel, and have given rise to legends as to how they were constructed (even today the exact method is not known). Until recently many Neapolitans believed that the models were of his servant and a pregnant woman, into whose veins an artificial substance was injected under pressure, but the latest research has shown that the models very artificial. He destroyed his own scientific archive before he died. After his death, his descendants, under threat of excommunication by the Church due to Raimondo's involvement with Freemasonry and alchemy, destroyed what was left of his writings, formulae, laboratory equipment and results of experiments.
Raimondo di Sansevero died in Naples in 1771, his death hastened by the continuous use of dangerous chemicals in his experiments and inventions. In 1794, the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg named the plant genus "Sansevieria" after him.

John Doreward

John Doreward (died 1420) was a Serjeant-at-law and Speaker of the House
Early life.
Outside the affairs of parliament, little is known of Doreward. He was apparently the son of William Doreward of Bocking, Essex who was a member of parliament for Essex in the eighteenth and twentieth parliaments of Edward III. According to James Alexander Manning, he was "of Dorewood Hall", and the name survives in 'Durward's', at Bocking in Essex and in 'Durward's Hall', between Witham and Kelvedon. At Bocking, he founded a chantry in 1397.
Political life.
Doreward was appointed High Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire for 1399 and elected knight of the shire (MP) six times for Essex (1395, Jan 1397, 1399, Jan 1404, May 1413 and April 1414). He was elected Speaker of the House in 1399 and 1413.
"The Constitutional History of England in its Origin and Development", vol. III, p. 18</ref> ... In the case of Sir John Cheyne, the Speaker elected in 1399, the excuse of ill-health was accepted by the king as valid; the clergy had in fact objected to the nomination; Sir John Cheyne withdrew, and John Doreward was chosen in his place.
The chronicler Robert Fabyan, writing about a hundred years after Doreward's first election as Speaker, gives a more obscure version of events: 
The Parliament was almost identical in makeup to the previous parliament held under Richard II, where thanks to the political manoeuvring of Sir John Bussy many of Parliament's powers had been stripped from them and given instead to a committee. The summoning of this parliament showed good political judgement on the part of the "de facto" king, Henry IV; in the words of Manning " could not have hoped to assemble a body of legislators less favourable to the captive monarch"
The Commons voted a large subsidy to pay for the war against Scotland and the defence of Ireland and Calais in the hopes that their requests for additional powers would be granted. The commons also voted for the arrest of William Scrope and Henry Green, both councillors of Richard II.
Doreward was again made Speaker of the House of Commons for the parliament of 1413; this was the first of Henry V, and he was appointed again apparently after his predecessor had resigned from ill-health. The parliament of 1413 granted Henry V a subsidy for four years; an unusually long period, this is understood to be explained by the new king's popularity.
Some historians have assumed that the John Doreward (or Dorewood) in the parliaments of 1399 and 1413 were father and son, but they are evidently the same person; the Speaker of the House of Commons in both cases was a serjeant-at-law, which was not an appointment held by either of Dorewood's sons.
He was appointed a member of Henry IV’s council from Nov 1399 to May 1406.
Memorials.
Doreward is commemorated by a brass memorial plate at St Mary's Church, Bocking, which can be found on the floor before the South Chapel. This gives the year of his death as 1420 and names his second wife as Isabella Baynard of Messing.
In 1440, Doreward's son, another John Doreward, founded an almshouse to be called the Maison Dieu of the town of Bocking, and later known as the Hospital of Bocking. Among its purposes was to pray for the soul of John Doreward, the founder's father.

Treklyano

Treklyano (, pronounced ; also transliterated "Trekljano" or "Trekliano") is a village in southwestern Bulgaria, part of Kyustendil Province. It is the administrative centre of Treklyano municipality, which lies in the northwestern part of Kyustendil Province. The village is located in the Kraishte area, very close to the Serbian border and not far from the Republic of Macedonia border. It is situated 40 kilometres north of the provincial capital of Kyustendil, 39 kilometres south of Tran and 100 kilometres west of the capital Sofia.
Treklyano lies in an isolated valley at the foot of the 1,733-metre Milevets peak in the border mountain of Milevska Planina. The Treklyano River, which runs through the village, flows into the Struma River at Zemen. The first reference to the village is in an early 15th-century Bulgarian text: ѠТ СЄЛО ТРИКЛИНО. It was also mentioned in Ottoman tax registers of 1570-1572 as "Predoshnitsa" or "Preglino" and a few years later, in 1576-1577, it was listed as "Terklyane". According to popular etymology, the old village name was "Tri Klena" ("Three maple trees"), as there was an area near the village where three maple trees were located. Linguists suggest a derivation from "*traklo", itself from "trak" ("tie, belt") or from Greek τρί-κλινος, "three-bedded", referring to stream beds. There is an area near the village where two rivers merge to make up a third one, i.e. forming three beds.
During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, the village has been abandoned and reestablshed several times. There was an influx of settlers during the First Serbian Uprising of 1804, the Second Serbian Uprising of 1815-1817 and after the newly liberated Principality of Serbia included some then-Bulgarian-populated areas in 1831-1833.
The first school in the village was a monastery school founded in 1853, while a secular school was opened 10 years later. A new Bulgarian Orthodox church dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos was built in 1860 at the place of an older church. After the Liberation of Bulgaria, Treklyano grew rapidly: at its peak it had up to 800 houses and a population of around 4,000. A community centre ("chitalishte") was established in 1901.
Municipality.
Treklyano municipality includes the following 19 places:
In the municipality, 1,111 people were registered in 2007, in the town there was 370 people.
Honour.
Treklyano Island off Robert Island, South Shetland Islands is named after Treklyano.

He was elected to serve as MP for Middlesex from 1784 to 1800. In the 1802 General election, he stood as candidate for Middlesex again was opposed by the radical Francis Burdett. Mainwaring had previously resisted Burdett's calls for an inquiry into prison abuses, particularly at Coldbath Fields Prison. Mainwaring was defeated by Burdett but the election was declared void in 1804 and in the following contest William's son George Boulton Mainwaring was elected. The result was reversed in favour of Burdett in 1805 and the back in favour of Mainwaring Junior in 1806. Mainwaring did not contest the 1807 election and Burdett was not elected.

Information Object Class (ASN.1)

ASN.1 Information Object Class is a concept widely used in ASN.1 specifications to address issues related to protocol specification similar to issues addressed by CORBA/IDL specifications.
Information Object Classes are used for example to specify ROSE (Remote Operations Service Element) protocol in ASN.1.
Abbreviations.
Abbreviations used throughout this article:
Introduction.
The simplest way of thinking of ASN.1 Information Object Classes is to regard them as a way to represent IDL specification in ASN.1 using concepts derived from the relational databases theory and SQL syntax in particular.
The concepts used in ASN.1 are more flexible than the ones used in IDL, because, continuing the analogy, they allow to "customize grammar" of the "IDL specification". ASN.1 encoding rules are used as a transfer syntax for remote invocations that resemble CORBA/IIOP.
In the light of this comparison, we can draw an approximate analogy between concepts used in Information Object Classes and SQL and IDL concepts as shown in Table 1.
Analogy by example.
Table 2 illustrates by example correspondence of ASN.1 concepts to similar constructs found in SQL and IDL.
Parameterization.
If you carefully examine the ASN.1 example presented in Table 2 and compare it to IDL concepts, you will see one important limitation on the ASN.1 side.
Our example ASN.1 data types which we agreed to compare to a high-level CORBA/IDL transfer syntax specification are limited to definition of such transfer syntax only for a single instance of what we compared to an IDL interface (Information Object Set in ASN.1 terms).
In other words, such transfer syntax is not generic and it is not reusable.
With the current set of known tools you can't define such a transfer syntax in a generic way in, say, ASN.1 specification A and then reuse it in ASN.1 specifications B and C that define concrete application-specific "IDL interfaces" on which A does not depend.
The reason for the current limitation is that we currently hard-code our Information Object Set (codice_1 in case of codice_2, or codice_3 in case of codice_4) into our ASN.1 data types (high-level transfer syntax specification).
Now we need to make one last step to have a complete and fully functioning system. We need to introduce a concept of type parameterization using Information Object Set as a type formal parameter.
Here is our codice_5 type rewritten with the concept of parameterization in mind:
Now the high-level transfer syntax descriptor codice_5 can be parameterized with any arbitrary Information Object Set ("IDL interface") conforming to the Information Object Class specification ("IDL grammar").
Therefore, we can now instantiate it for any Information Object Set as follows:
The WITH SYNTAX clause.
The WITH SYNTAX clause is effectively a tiny grammar language used to express ways of syntactic definitions of Information Objects.
Consider the following example:
Enclosure in square brackets ([]) means optionality of syntactic constructs contained in [].
Optionality can be nested.
Tokens all in capital mean keywords, tokens starting with & mean productions requiring substitution of the corresponding entity in place of the token (ASN.1 value, type, or Information Object Set, either instance or reference thereof), depending on the Information Object Class to which this field refers.
Now what we would have otherwise been written as:
in the presence of the WITH SYNTAX clause can be rewritten as follows:
To fully understand the grammar concept behind the WITH SYNTAX clause, imagine we wrote our OPERATION Information Object Class definition as follows:
Then a corresponding Information Object instance for the definition above is to be defined as follows:

Peter Haigh

Peter Varley Haigh (28 July 1925 – 18 January 2001) was an English in-vision announcer for BBC Television in the years after the Second World War.
Born in North London, the son of an engineer, he was educated at Aldenham School, Aldenham, Hertfordshire. He was commissioned in 1944 into the 5th Battalion, the Welsh Guards. He served in Palestine and Egypt, and joined the British Forces Broadcasting Service in Jerusalem. He later helped start up the BBC Overseas News station in Mombasa, Kenya.
After leaving the army he failed to get a job as a BBC Radio announcer, but joined BBC Television as an announcer in March 1952 after a trial at Alexandra Palace, then the base of BBC Television. He joined the team of continuity announcers headed by McDonald Hobley and Sylvia Peters. He went on to present "Come Dancing" and "Picture Parade", a film review programme in 1956 with co-presenter Derek Bond, the actor.
In 1958 he provided the BBC commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest, staged that year in Hilversum, Netherlands. He also provided the BBC radio commentary for the contest in 1962. He also presented the BBC radio programme "Movie Go Round" on Sunday afternoons in the early 1960s.
Although he fitted well into the style of 1950s BBC Television, with the changing style of TV after the introduction of commercial television in 1955, his career declined, and his first marriage broke up. In 1957 he had married the 1950s film star Jill Adams. The couple had a daughter, Peta Louise.
From the early '70s he lived in Portugal running a restaurant and bar popular with British tourists, and met his German-born second wife, Inge. They returned to the UK in the 1980s but he could not resume his broadcasting career. He made a final television appearance as guest of Des Lynam on a series called "It's My Pleasure". He later worked occasionally for BBC radio and did voice-overs for advertisements.

Mutsuki-class destroyer

The were a class of twelve destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. All were given traditional poetic names of the months of the year by the Lunar calendar or phases of the moon. Some authors consider the "Kamikaze" and "Mutsuki"-class destroyers to be extensions of the earlier .
Background.
With the imposition of the Washington Naval Treaty limiting the number and size of capital warships, increased emphasis was placed by the Imperial Japanese Navy on the quantity and firepower of its destroyer fleet to counter what was perceived to be the growing threat from the United States Navy. The "Mutsuki" class destroyers were an improved version of the "Kamikaze" class destroyers and were ordered under the 1923 fiscal budget. 
Along with the "Minekaze" and "Kamikaze" classes, the "Mutsuki" class ships formed the backbone of Japanese destroyer formations throughout the twenties and thirties. The "Minekaze" and "Kamikaze" classes were withdrawn from front line service and reassigned to secondary duties towards the end of the 1930s, but the "Mutsuki" were retained as first line destroyers due to their range and their more powerful torpedo armament. All saw combat during World War II, and none survived the war. 
Initially, the "Mutsuki" class ships had only hull numbers due to the projected large number of warships the Japanese navy expected to build through the Eight-eight fleet plan. This proved to be extremely unpopular with the crews and was a constant source of confusion in communications. In August 1928, names were assigned.
Design.
The "Mutsuki" class destroyers were based on the same hull design as the previous "Kamikaze" class, except with a double curvature configuration of the bow, a feature which became a standard in all later Japanese destroyers.
The "Mutsuki" class was the first to be fitted with the newly developed 24 inch torpedoes, with greater range and larger warhead than previous torpedoes in the Japanese inventory. Originally Type 8 torpedoes were carried, arranged in two triple mountings. These were later replaced with the famous Type 93 "Long Lance" oxygen-propelled torpedoes during World War II.
In September 1935, many ships in the navy were severely damaged by a typhoon while on training exercises, in what was later termed the "Fourth Fleet Incident", including a number of the "Mutsuki" class destroyers, which had several plates buckled and bridges wrecked. During 1936-37 the "Mutsuki" class ships were retrofitted with a strengthened, more compact, bridge, with redesigned watertight shields on the torpedo mounts. With the new shields the torpedoes could be worked in all weather conditions thus extending the useful life of the class.
From 1941-1942 the "Mutsuki" class destroyers were refitted with the 4.7"/45 main guns reduced to two single mounts and ten Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Guns added. The minesweeping and minelaying equipment was removed and replaced with four depth charge launchers, with 36 depth charges.
In June 1944, the surviving vessels were again refit, with the number of Type 96 25 mm antiaircraft guns increased to twenty, and an additional five Type 93 13 mm AA Guns also installed.
Operational history.
The "Mutsuki" class formed the 5th and 6th Destroyer Squadrons. "Mutsuki" and "Kisaragi" participated in the Battle of Wake Island at the start of the war, during which time "Kisaragi" was lost due to aircraft bombardment. The remaining eleven vessels participated in the invasions of the Philippines and Netherlands East Indies. In the subsequent Solomon Islands campaign surviving ships were exposed to considerable danger as fast transports in “Tokyo Express” missions in trying to re-supply island garrisons. "Mutsuki", "Nagatsuki," "Kikuzuki", "Mikazuki" and "Mochizuki" were lost due to air attack in various battles in the Solomons.
Surviving vessels participated in the New Guinea campaign, mostly in the role of “Tokyo Express” transports. "Yayoi" was lost in an air attack off New Guinea and "Fumizuki" in Operation Hailstone at Truk. In the final stages of the war, "Uzuki" was lost to US PT-boats and "Satsuki" and "Yūzuki" to an attacks and "Minazuki" to submarine torpedoes in the Philippines.
None of the "Mutsuki" class destroyers survived the war.

After These Messages... We'll Be Right Back!

"After These Messages... We'll Be Right Back!" is the twentieth issue of the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight" series of comic books, a continuation of the television series of the same name. The issue is written by Jeph Loeb, and follows in the style of the undeveloped "Buffy the Animated Series" spin-off proposed in 2002, on which he worked alongside series creator Joss Whedon.
Plot.
As Buffy slays numerous demons, her thoughts say that she never gets any sleep anymore. When she finally gets a chance to rest (dirty all over and in Xander's bed), Buffy falls asleep while Xander screams for her to get out.
Buffy awakes (in an animated style) to her mother's voice telling her she's going to be late for school. Buffy is shocked to hear Joyce and hides her face in her pillow muttering "Dream, dream, go away. Come again another... never." Joyce enters her room with a younger Dawn as Buffy jumps from her bed and wraps her arms around Joyce. After moving to hugging Dawn and exclaiming that she isn't a centaur anymore, Joyce goes to leave the room. Buffy stops her and says, "I "really" am happy to see you." Joyce, after checking to see if Buffy has a fever, tells her if she doesn't get a move on, Buffy won't be able to go the party that night. Buffy is surprised to hear that she's going to a party at all.
At school, Buffy is surprised to see Willow alive, and back to her Season One self. Cordelia is, of course, making fun of Willow and Buffy steps in, informing Willow that one day she may be a mega-witch and Cordelia might be dead, to which Willow smirks and says, "Do I get to wear a pointy hat?" Xander comes rushing down the hallway on his skateboard and crashes. Principal Snyder threatens to take his skateboard away. Buffy tells Xander that Snyder might be eaten by a giant snake and that Xander might wear an eyepatch and be in charge of hundreds of hot girls. At that comment, Willow coughs and Buffy remembers that Willow likes Xander and is not aware of her homosexuality. Buffy, Xander, and Willow go looking for Giles.
That night, Xander, Buffy, and Willow go to the graveyard and meet Giles who says that "the fate of the world is at risk over what happens tonight." Buffy thinks to herself that she remembers this is "where life gets in the way of [her living it." Giles explaining that the disciples of Morgala worship something called Morgala. Buffy brushes off Giles' warning, casual spinning her stake, and says she'll find these disciples. 
On a two-page spread, Buffy is fighting three disciples of Morgala and slays all of them, with unnecessary commentary by Xander.
They return to Giles in the graveyard, planning what they'll do for the party tonight. Giles says the disciples of Morgala were worshiping "the image of a dragon" to which Buffy responds that she "didn't see any dragon." Giles frankly says "Buffy, you need to take your role in this more seriously." Buffy, in a fit of rage, explains that she is only trying to have some fun and that someday there will be eighteen hundred slayers and everyone is going to call her "ma'am" and storms off to the party, leaving Giles speechless. 
That night in Buffy's home. Buffy puts on the cross Angel gave her and stops to look at it. Joyce comes in to warn Buffy that she doesn't think the party Buffy is going to is going to be safe. Buffy reassures her that everything is going to be okay and hugs her mother. Joyce tells Buffy that she can always come home to which Buffy looks at her mother and says "right" with her thoughts saying "sigh."
On the way to the party, Buffy runs into Angel. Angel is impressed that Buffy went up against the five disciples of Morgala. Buffy ignores his comments, touching the side of his face and says "If you knew something about someone's past and...future...would you tell them?" Angel responds with "Probably not. You can't change a person's past. And just by telling them, you'll change their future into who knows what." Buffy says goodbye, and continues on her way to the party.
Standing in front of the house, Buffy realizes Angel said "five" disciples when she only took on three and storms off, hoping to make it back in time for the party.
Buffy finds the disciples who conjure up a dragon. Buffy leads it outside, it throws her into the air to which Buffy exclaims that she can see her house from that high. Cordelia, below the dragon and Buffy, trash talks how Buffy didn't even come to the party and Buffy's boot lands on her head. Buffy defeats the dragon by removing a large crystal from its forehead. 
As Buffy falls to the ground, she wakes up (normal drawing) to Xander screaming for her to get out of his bed. Buffy awakens a bit disoriented. She finds it surprising that Xander has an eyepatch and that Dawn is a centaur and not a robot centaur. She also jumps at Willow calling her "You're all gay and magicky now!" After calming down she explains to Dawn, Xander, and Willow that she had a dream back in high school. She thought it would have been fun to go back to when times were more simple. But it turns out they were just the same as they are now, only in a different way. 
In the final panel, Buffy is looking at the reader. The Season One (animated style) is behind her, faded slightly. Her voice over says "Maybe Angel was right. You can't change a person's past. And just by telling them, you'll change their future into who knows what. But for one brief moment, it was nice to go home again."
Production.
This issue was written by Jeph Loeb, who worked on the animated series with Joss Whedon. The issue has a link to the animated series and the plot is similar to one partially seen during a promo for the animated series.
The issue had some problems at the beginning as artists had to be approved by Sarah Michelle Gellar's representatives, and since there was no official artist working yet, Loeb had not started work on the script as he 'tailors the script around the artist he is working with'.
Canonical issues.
This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of "Buffy", Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this story, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by "Buffy" and "Angel".
"Season Eight" contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as "Queen of the Slayers" and "Dark Congress", which are described as being set in an unofficial "parallel continuity.
Timing.
"Season Eight" is set after "Buffy"'s seventh season and also after "Angel"'s fifth and "". The dream sequence featured is set in Season One after the episode “Angel”.

Steffen Heidrich

Steffen Heidrich (born 19 July 1967) is a German former footballer who is now sporting director of Erzgebirge Aue.
Heidrich, who played as a goalscoring attacking midfielder, began his career with FC Karl-Marx-Stadt, and quickly became an important first-team player, as the club enjoyed relative success in the late 1980s. He earned one cap for East Germany, as a substitute for Rico Steinmann in a match against Egypt shortly before reunification. He stayed at Chemnitzer FC (as the club was now renamed), playing in the 2. Bundesliga until 1993, when he joined VfB Leipzig, just promoted to the Bundesliga. Heidrich played thirty times in the Bundesliga scoring four goals, as VfB were relegated. He remained with the club for four years, where he was a regular first-team player and a consistent goalscorer. However, they suffered a second relegation in 1998, and Heidrich moved on to FC Energie Cottbus, who had been promoted in their place. He captained Energie to their first ever promotion to the Bundesliga in 2000, but only made two appearances in the top flight, and left at the end of the 2000–01 season, joining Dynamo Dresden. He helped Dynamo earn promotion to the 2. Liga in 2004, but injury restricted him to just eight appearances, and he retired in 2005.
Heidrich then took up the role of general manager at Dynamo Dresden, and later Energie Cottbus. In 2012, he became sporting director of Erzgebirge Aue. He studied for this role at the Dresden University of Technology.

Heqanakht papyri

The Heqanakht papyri or Heqanakht letters (also spelled Hekanakht) are a group of papyri dating to the early Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt that were found in the tomb complex of Vizier Ipi. Their find was located in the burial chamber of a servant named Meseh, which was to the right side of the courtyard of Ipi's burial complex. It is believed that the papyri were accidentally mixed into debris used to form a ramp to push the coffin of Meseh into the chamber. The papyri contain letters and accounts written by (or on behalf of) Heqanakht, a ka-priest of Ipi. Heqankht himself was obliged to stay in the Theban area (probably because of his responsibilities in the necropolis), and thus wrote letters to his family, probably located somewhere near the capital of Egypt at that time, near the Faiyum. These letters and accounts were somehow lost and thus preserved. The significance of the papers is that they give rare and valuable information about lives of ordinary members of the lower upper class of Egypt during this period.
Scholarship.
These papyri have been published and discussed several times. Cerny and Baer dwelt on economic and social issues, relating to land tenure, land ownership, monetary units and similar topics. Silver discussed macro and micro aspects of the commodity wages paid to estate workers, and other commodity monetary transactions cited in the Heqanakht papers. James and Allen prepared complete translations with commentaries, while Wente offered translations. The materials allowed people to understand both domestic squabbles and household management during that time.
Significance.
In the monetary system at the time of the papyri's creation, rent and taxes were generally (but not invariably) paid to Pharaoh in grain. For example, the text reports:
"Furthermore behold, 15 sacks of emmer are in the possession of Nenek-su (nnk-sw) at Hut-haa (Hw.t-hAA) and 13 (sacks ?) and 5 (bushels ?) of Lower Egyptian barley are in the possession of Ipi the Younger (jpj-Xrd) at Yusebek (jw-sbk). That which is in the possession of Neher's (nHr) son Ipi (jpj) at Sepat-mat (spA.t-mA.t) (amounts to) 20 (sacks of) emmer and (in the possession of) his brother Desher (dSr) 3 (sacks). The total is 38 (sacks of emmer and) 13 (sacks) and 5 (bushel ?) (of Lower Egyptian barley). Concerning anyone who will give me oil in payment - he shall give me 1 hbn.t-jar for 2 (sacks) of Lower Egyptian barley or for 3 (sacks) of emmer."
In terms of the understanding of what one would call "money," Heqanakht clearly calculated values in grain (particularly barley). However, he was able to convert this without difficulties into equivalent values in oil, textiles or copper. He both expected and offered payments in different commodities. The precise details of his calculations are priceless. For general purposes, however, he only valued new barley himself and was perfectly willing to put his family on short rations in the hope of profit (as Baer noted). On the other hand, however, once a temporary shortage was overcome, he did not view the grain as being particularly valuable: its use value was nil when the family was fed and its exchange value did not exist when his family needed to be fed.
For example: "Record of the household's incomes: Ipi (jpj) and her servant woman 8 (heqat), Hetepet (Htp.t) and her servant woman 8 (heqat), Heti's (Ht) son Nakht (nxt) together with his dependants 8 (heqat), Merisu (mr.sw) and his dependants 8 (heqat), Sahathor (zA-Hwt-Hr) 8 (heqat), Sanebnut (ZA-nb-n'.t) 7 (heqat), Anpu (jnp) 4 (heqat), Snefru (snfr.w) 4 (heqat), Sa-inut (zA-jnw.t) 4 (heqat), Mai-sa-hetepet (may-zA-Htp.t) 5 (heqat), Nofret (nfr.t) 3½ (heqat), Satwerut (zA.t-wr.wt) (?) 2 (heqat): Total 79½ (heqat)").
The papyri are also significant to the study of ancient economic thought, accountancy, and the history of Egyptian fractions and Egyptian multiplication and division. For example, accounting during the Egyptian Middle Kingdom used a double entry system within expected and observed (practical zero totals). A zero symbol denoted an empty account. The Akhmim Wooden Tablet, the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll, the RMP 2/n table, the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, the Ebers Papyrus and other mathematical texts reported expected and observed Egyptian fractions totals. Totals were written in quotients and scaled/unscaled remainder units. A meta context of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom weights and measures system had empowered one of the earliest Ancient Near East monetary systems. The Egyptian economy was able to double-check its management elements by using double entry accounting, and theoretical or abstract weights and measures units.

David Wilson (died 20 July 1998) was a convicted murderer and the second person to be executed by Saint Kitts and Nevis since it became a sovereign state in 1983.
In February 1996, Wilson and Clement Thomas were convicted of beating a security guard to death in 1994. Wilson was sentenced to death by the trial judge, and his appeal was upheld by the appeal court. After the appeal court's judgment, Governor-General Clement Arrindell signed Wilson's death warrant, and he was executed by hanging on 20 July 1998. It was the first execution in Saint Kitts and Nevis since 1985.
Wilson's execution was controversial because it was carried out before he was able to appeal his case to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which is the supreme court for Saint Kitts and Nevis.

Antigua honeymoon murders

The Antigua honeymoon murders refers to the murder of Ben Mullany, (1977–2008), and Catherine Mullany, (1977–2008), two British newlywed health professionals (a student physiotherapist and doctor) who were murdered during their honeymoon in Antigua, and its after effects. Their murders have sparked a diplomatic row between Antigua and the United Kingdom and have resulted in sweeping legislative reform in Antigua. 
Background.
Ben Mullany, who was from Ystalyfera, Wales, was training to become a physiotherapist and was in his third year at the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, England. Catherine Mullany, who had grown up a few miles away from her future husband, was a paediatrician training to be a general practitioner. On 12 July 2008, Ben and Catherine married at St John the Evangelist Church in Cilybebyll, Wales. Two days after the marriage, the couple checked into Antigua’s Cocos Hotel on 14 July 2008.
The night before they were to return to the United Kingdom, only two weeks after their wedding, the couple were fatally shot in their cottage in what was thought to be a botched robbery attempt. Catherine was shot in the head and died instantly. Ben suffered a gunshot wound to the neck. Though he was able to signal and murmur to the paramedics, on the way to the hospital he lapsed into a coma. Ben's parents, who flew to Antigua with Catherine's parents, decided to fly him back to Britain via air ambulance in a last-ditch attempt to save his life. Ben was taken to Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales, where his murdered wife, Catherine, had worked.
On 3 August 2008, exactly one week after his wife died, following brain stem testing, Ben Mullany died. His life support machines were turned off after doctors told his parents that there was no chance of recovery. The couple were buried together in Cilybebyll. Their funeral was held at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff, Wales on 10 September 2008. Around 900 people attended including Sarah, Duchess of York.
In July 2011, Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were found guilty of their murders and that of a shopkeeper, Woneta Anderson.
Effects.
Sweeping legislative reforms in Antigua.
Antigua Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer, in an attempt to save the island's tourism, is implementing measures in order to increase Antigua's police power including stop-and-search powers for the police, systematic searches of pockets "within various communities" for guns and drugs, new surveillance cameras and wire-tapping. Spencer has indicated that he is in the process of introducing legislative actions that will make the actions legal and permanent.
Additional changes have been made regarding the death penalty, gun trafficking, and assaults with a weapon. "Antigua's government will introduce the death penalty for crimes involving weapons in the wake of the murders of a British honeymoon couple. The new sentencing legislation will be for anyone who uses a gun or knife in a crime which results in death or serious injury." The new law also imposes a requirement for judges to hand down a minimum sentence of 25 years in prison and enables judges to ask for a life sentence if need be in cases involving assault with a weapon. Under current law, the death penalty is applied only in murder cases. This legislation will apply it to any crime involving a knife/gun and to gun trafficking. In addition, the previous law required that there be a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for assault with a weapon.
Pending diplomatic row.
The British government faces a diplomatic row with Antigua over the shooting of the honeymoon couple after demanding that anyone convicted of the crime will not face the death penalty. The British demand to its former colony is understood to have vexed Antigua’s leadership as Western interference in Antigua’s police and justice systems is a highly contentious issue in the country.
In 2000, the two countries clashed diplomatically after a similar crime in which the United Kingdom tried to stop the execution of Steadroy McDougal for the murder of another British couple. McDougal was eventually reprieved in August 2002.
Prime Minister Spencer has also blamed Britain and the United States for the escalating violence in his country, saying that over 280 criminals had been deported to Antigua over the last decade, many of whom had few local ties. "To any small island developing state, this figure is astronomically high. In ours, with its small population, these criminal deportees, with skills developed and nurtured in the US and the UK, are impacting tremendously on our society." These remarks have generated great controversy.
The Mullany Fund.
On 5 September 2008, the family and friends of Ben and Cath Mullany launched a memorial fund that will raise money to support British students wishing to study medicine or physiotherapy. The Duchess of York is patron of the charity which is also supported by Sir Vivian Richards.

&quot;Rommel?&quot; &quot;Gunner Who?&quot;

Spike Milligan's second volume of war autobiography, "Rommel?" "Gunner Who?": A Confrontation in the Desert, was published in 1974, with Jack Hobbs credited as an editor. This book spans events from January to May 1943, during Operation "Torch", the Allied liberation of Africa in World War II. (The preface to the earlier book states this will be a trilogy, but ultimately he writes seven volumes.)
As before, the book is in an unusual format freely mixing multimedia formats, with narrative anecdotes, contemporaneous photography, ridiculously non-contemporaneous steel engravings and illustrations, excerpts from actual diaries, actual letters, and rough sketches, along with absurd memoranda from Nazi officials (sometimes called "Hitlergrams"). A map is included.
In a later volume, Milligan wrote, "I wish the reader to know that he is not reading a tissue of lies and fancies, it all "really happened"". In retrospect, the reader is left in some doubt – for the Prologue to this volume reads:
Some details, such as a facsimile clipping announcing the death of a comrade (an atypical somber moment in the book) can be assumed factual. Moreover, much other information is apparently intended to be accurate:
On the other hand, speaking of the dedication to "brother Desmond who made my boyhood happy", Norma Farnes, editor of "The Compulsive Spike Milligan" said "Desmond and I roared with laughter over this fantasy. They used to argue like hell.
Summary.
Milligan’s 19 Battery 56th Heavy Rgt. R.A. has arrived in Algeria. With his rank of gunner, there is no one under his command; his promotion later in the book is the source of comment. An officer, Lt. Budden says: "Bombardier?" He turned and looked out the window. "Oh, dear."
One of Milligan’s first battle encounters is to yell at a passing airplane "I hope you crash, you noisy bastard!" — it immediately does. But the plane was Allied. 
In a couple weeks they leave the comforts in the area of Cap Matifou, heading east into battle areas, and are now eating army food. Their cook is upper class:
Milligan stays in various accommodations, from a two-man tent stolen from American supplies (which his best friend Edgington burns down while attacking a scorpion), to appropriated housing. The native Arabs are still in the area. Milligan sneaks food a few times to a farmer whose family is "having a rough time". Later, they adopt a French dog; when the owner returns to check his house, he mistakenly shoots it; they spend the evening drinking with him in commiseration.
As they see action, one gun crew is puzzled to discover their gun is missing after being fired. It's gone over a cliff, and narrowly avoids killing future Goon Harry Secombe, whom Milligan later meets in passing:
Part of Milligan's job is laying phone lines. On one occasion silence is imperative, since they're close to the enemy, however the hole in the cable drum spool is square, making a great noise as it unreels.
There's limited time for band music, but Milligan and Edgington play on opposites sides of a bombed out floor. Shortly after Edgington finishes, the piano falls through. Milligan reflects: "It's not often we had been detailed to:—'Clean up that mess of a French Colonial Piano.'"
While driving with Major Chater Jack:
Amid Milligan's persistent whistling and joking are moments of reflection:
And, at the end of the book, as the army triumphantly enters into Tunis:
Critical review.
The first volume was given strong reviews by "The Sunday Times" and the "Times Literary Supplement". The "Morning Star" review adds: "The second volume of Milligan's war biography left me with a determination to repair the omission of not having read the first volume ... and an equal determination to look out for the third volume when it appears."

Aligned Assets

Aligned Assets are a UK-based full service company from Surrey that develops address management and gazetteer software for local authorities, the emergency services and the commercial sector. They almost exclusively work with the AddressBase products from the Ordnance Survey.
History.
Aligned Assets were formed in 1996 by Carl Nunn, later joined by Phil Gee in 1997 and Mike Saunt (now of Astun Technology) in 1998, who all met whilst working together for MapInfo (now Pitney Bowes MapInfo). Originally working as MapInfo resellers and Geographical Information System (GIS) developers, the company saw early success by securing contracts with companies such as the BBC, Experian and Orange (brand).
Aligned Assets moved into address management with the development in 1997 of the BS7666 Toolbox that was built on behalf of MapInfo to assist UK Local Authorities in the development of the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG). It was the BS7666 Toolbox that went on to form the basis of their current Gazetteer Management System, Symphony iManage.
They are currently the only UK software provider to specialise solely in the gazetteer market working both in the local government sector and with the emergency services. They are the chosen supplier to the British Transport Police, Transport for London, Birmingham City Council and were involved in the FiReControl project.
After the introduction of BS7666:2006, they were the first company to achieve accredition to the new standard and the first company to have one of their customers fully migrated.
Recent developments have seen them complement their gazetteer management systems with software designed for property management.
Current Products.
iManage - The core of Symphony Suite allowing the creation and maintenance of street, land & property gazetteers. It allows for gazetteer data to be displayed geographically in a map window and was the first product in the UK to be BS7666:2006 accredited.
iExchange - A delivery tool used in local government for disseminating Local Land and Property Gazetteer (LLPG) data to departmental systems such as council Tax, electoral roll, planning, etc. as well as automating updates to the NLPG.
iValidate – A module that allows the user to qualify street, land & property data and check for BS7666 compliancy.
iMatch – An addressing matching tool that synchronises legacy systems against BS7666 gazetteers. Works by writing a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) against successful matches and geocoding the data.
iPlot – A mapping tool that allows the user to design their digitised maps for print in a variety of formats.
Street Naming and Numbering – A module that is designed to speed up the process within local authorities when dealing with the street naming and numbering process.
SinglePoint – Originally built for the British Transport Police, SinglePoint is a multi-gazetteer search engine that is able to return sub-second search results via web services from the AddressBase products as well as searching other non-BS7666 gazetteers simultaneously via the use of adaptors.
Xtended Data Module (XDM) – A supplementary module within the gazetteer management system, the Xtended Data Module allows for additional (non-BS7666) information to be stored in the gazetteer via additional user-defined fields.
Symphony Property Management System (PMS) – Enables an organisation to manage the maintenance, acquisition, sales and legalities involved in the management of large property estates ranging from schools, leisure centres, social housing, parks and investment property such as shops and industrial estates.
Products for the Emergency Services.
Symphony Bluelight Gazetteer - Allows the emergency services to take copies of and updates to AddressBase Premium, which can be built on with local records, improved with candidate records and extended with the Xtended Data Module. It was designed and built in collaboration with the emergency services and is the UK's only gazetteer management system specifically for this sector.
Symphony SinglePoint - Based on the solution designed and built for the BTP, Symphony SinglePoint is a flexible, web-enabled search engine that allows the user to search their address database and return results in sub-second time. Its basic concept stems from the idea that the quicker data can be accessed, the quicker it can be used and the better the emergency response. More recently it has been enabled to search names data.
Recent developments.
The start of 2010 saw the company move into the commercial sector after they became the UK's first reseller of NLPG data. More recently they announced themselves as the first UK company to be able to provide products compatible with the NLPG's replacement - AddressBase.
In addition to software for local government and the emergency services, they now offer address management solutions to Housing Associations, Insurance Companies, Utility Firms and into Customer Relationship Management amongst others. These solutions consist mainly of SinglePoint web services and Symphony PMS, both of which are provided prepopulated with AddressBase data.
On 6 July 2010, Aligned Assets announced that they had moved to a new business model, offering Software By Subscription. A quote on their website from their Managing Director Dinesh Thanigasalam states, "“By moving to Software By Subscription, we have completely scrapped up front software fees and as a consequence have been able to lower our year-one pricing by an average of 60%.”" 
Business Culture.
Aligned Assets are regarded as a staff-orientated company with continual staff development a priority. They are an ISO 9001 certified company and are also Investors in People accredited. They pursue a carbon offsetting policy by which they contribute to a fund proportional to the amount of miles driven as a result of company business.

Snake Shyam

M.S. Balasubramaniam, popularly known as Snake Shyam, is a snake enthusiast, wildlife conservationist and lecturer in Mysore, India. Though not a trained herpetologist, he is known throughout the Mysore region as a "naturalist on wheels". Shyam rescues and rehabilitates snakes and educates the public about them. He is also sometimes consulted by local hospitals to identify a species of snake prior to treating a snakebite victim.
Shyam has been widely recognized for his work. National Geographic featured him in its "Croc Chronicles: Snakes, Karma, Action" special. Mysore city has named a street for him and has dedicated its first "urban forest" to him and fellow environmentalist Hyder Ali Khan.
Shyam is also known for his personal flamboyance and has been described by "The Hindu" as "easily the most recognisable characters of Mysore, complete with his sun hat, overflowing beads and multiple rings that adorn his fingers".
Avocation.
By profession, Shyam was a driver, transporting children to school, but beginning in 1982 he began to be frequently called upon to retrieve snakes that had encroached on people's properties, a job for which he receives no pay. Called multiple times each day, Shyam uses a pillowcase and a badminton racquet without strings to net the snakes, which he then releases into the forest. Though his avocation to safely remove these snakes has cost him considerable expense, Shyam continues from the desire to see these snakes released rather than killed. Recently, authorities in Mysore have offered to defray some of Shyam's expenses by paying his telephone bills. 
In 2004, he estimated that he may have caught and released over 40,000 snakes since he began in 1982; as of February 2008, the official record, which he began in 1999, was 11,755. Though Shyam has only been bitten four times in his rescue work, he has developed an allergy to antivenin, which requires that he exercise great care in handling snakes.
His knowledge of snakes—he can identify 28-30 local species of snakes—is founded on personal experience, but supplemented by reading the works of or speaking to professionals such as Romulus Whitaker, J.C. Daniel and faculty at Mysore University. Shyam's van features paintings depicting snakes and also displays his slogans: "Snakes are not as poisonous as human beings" and "Care for the rare". 
Snake Sham was elected to Mysore City Corporation from ward number 17 in the elections held in March 2013.

USS Waxsaw (AN-91)

USS "Waxsaw" (YN-120/AN-91) was a "Cohoes"-class net laying ship which was assigned to protect United States Navy ships and harbors during World War II with her anti-submarine nets. Her World War II career was cut short due to the war coming to an end, but, post-war, she was reactivated and served the Navy until she was put into reserve and eventually transferred to Venezuela.
Constructed in Minnesota.
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, "Waxsaw" (AN-91) -- originally classified as "YN-120" -- was laid down on 31 May 1944 at Duluth, Minnesota, by the Zenith Dredge Co.; launched on 15 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Conlon, wife of the general manager of the Zenith Dredge Co. shipyard; and commissioned on 6 May 1945, Lt. Kearny R. Garrison, USNR, in command.
World War II related service.
The new netlaying ship sailed for Boston, Massachusetts, on 11 May, and arrived there on the 29th, after steaming via Cleveland, Ohio; Ogdensburg, New York; the St. Lawrence Seaway; Cornwall, Ontario; Montreal and Quebec, Quebec Province; and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Following shakedown out of Melville, Rhode Island, from 13 to 30 June, the netlayer put into Boston for post-shakedown availability.
"Waxsaw" headed for the Panama Canal on 10 July, expecting her ultimate destination to be Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands. However, upon her arrival at the Small Craft Training Center, San Pedro, California, she was ordered to the Naval Net Depot and Training School, Tiburon Bay, California, for 18 days of refresher training. 
Arriving there on 10 August, the ship remained in the San Francisco, California, region on temporary duty in connection with the removal of the net line protecting San Francisco after the Japanese surrender in mid-August. Completing that duty on 24 September, "Waxsaw" underwent an availability at Alameda, California, before she was assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
Post-war service.
On 12 October 1945, the netlayer headed for the U.S. East Coast in company with sister ship . Attached to Service Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 3 November, "Waxsaw" operated at Green Cove Springs, Florida, establishing moorings at the St. Johns River area for the Reserve Fleet units until late in 1949, when she was shifted to her new home port of Norfolk, Virginia.
Based there at the time of the outbreak of the Korean War in the summer of 1950, "Waxsaw" not only took part in extensive netlaying operations in Hampton Roads, Virginia, but also towed targets and participated in various training exercises in ensuing months.
For the next nine years, "Waxsaw" operated with the Atlantic Fleet off the eastern seaboard of the United States, ranging from Nova Scotia to Key West, Florida. Her home ports during this time included Norfolk, Virginia; Key West, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina. 
During those years, "Waxsaw" performed a variety of service functions; participated in mine-hunting exercises; laid nets and buoys during U.S. Atlantic Fleet amphibious exercises including amphibious maneuvers off Onslow Beach, North Carolina; cleared objects from the channel entrance at Hampton Roads; and even briefly operated at Charleston as a salvage vessel equipped with compressors, a recompression chamber, and other deep-sea diving gear. She also took part in NATO exercises off Nova Scotia and served at the Mine Defense Laboratory at Panama City, Florida.
Final inactivation.
Decommissioned on 23 March 1960, "Waxsaw" was ultimately transferred under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program to Venezuela in October 1963. Renamed "Puerto Miranda (H-30)", the netlayer served with the Venezuelan Navy as a survey ship into the late 1970s. Struck from the Navy List in December 1977, the ship was deleted from the Venezuelan Navy List apparently soon thereafter.

History of attachment theory

Attachment theory, originating in the work of John Bowlby, is a psychological, evolutionary and ethological theory that provides a descriptive and explanatory framework for understanding interpersonal relationships between human beings. 
In order to formulate a comprehensive theory of the nature of early attachments, Bowlby explored a range of fields including evolution by natural selection, object relations theory (psychoanalysis), control systems theory, evolutionary biology and the fields of ethology and cognitive psychology. There were some preliminary papers from 1958 onwards but the full theory is published in the trilogy "Attachment and Loss", 1969- 82. Although in the early days Bowlby was criticised by academic psychologists and ostracised by the psychoanalytic community, attachment theory has become the dominant approach to understanding early social development and given rise to a great surge of empirical research into the formation of children's close relationships.
Brief description of theory.
In infants, behavior associated with attachment is primarily a process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in situations of perceived distress or alarm, for the purpose of survival. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a "secure base" to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant. 
The human infant is considered by attachment theorists to have a need for a secure relationship with adult caregivers, without which normal social and emotional development will not occur. However, different relationship experiences can lead to different developmental outcomes. Mary Ainsworth developed a theory of a number of attachment patterns or "styles" in infants in which distinct characteristics were identified; these were secure attachment, avoidant attachment, anxious attachment and, later, disorganized attachment. In addition to care-seeking by children, peer relationships of all ages, romantic and sexual attraction, and responses to the care needs of infants or sick or elderly adults may be construed as including some components of attachment behavior.
Earlier theories.
A theory of attachment is a framework of ideas that attempt to explain attachment, the almost universal human tendency to prefer certain familiar companions over other people, especially when ill, injured, or distressed. Historically, certain social preferences, like those of parents for their children, were explained by reference to instinct, or the moral worth of the individual. The concept of infants' emotional attachment to caregivers has been known anecdotally for hundreds of years. Most early observers focused on the anxiety displayed by infants and toddlers when threatened with separation from a familiar caregiver. Psychological theories about attachment were suggested from the late nineteenth century onward. Freudian theory attempted a systematic consideration of infant attachment and attributed the infant's attempts to stay near the familiar person to motivation learned through feeding experiences and gratification of libidinal drives. In the 1930s, the British developmentalist Ian Suttie put forward the suggestion that the child's need for affection was a primary one, not based on hunger or other physical gratifications. A third theory prevalent at the time of Bowlby's development of attachment theory was "dependency". This approach posited that infants were dependent on adult caregivers but that dependency was, or should be outgrown as the individual matured. Such an approach perceived attachment behaviour in older children as regressive whereas within attachment theory older children and adults remain attached and indeed a secure attachment is associated with independent exploratory behaviour rather than dependence. William Blatz, a Canadian psychologist and teacher of Bowlby's colleague Mary Ainsworth, was among the first to stress the need for security as a normal part of personality at all ages, as well as normality of the use of others as a secure base and the importance of social relationships for other aspects of development.
Current attachment theory focuses on social experiences in early childhood as the source of attachment in childhood and in later life. Attachment theory was developed by Bowlby as a consequence of his dissatisfaction with existing theories of early relationships.
Early developments.
Bowlby was influenced by the beginnings of the object relations school of psychoanalysis and in particular, Melanie Klein, although he profoundly disagreed with the psychoanalytic belief then prevalent that saw infants' responses as relating to their internal fantasy life rather than to real life events. As Bowlby began to formulate his concept of attachment, he was influenced by case studies by Levy, Powdermaker, Lowrey, Bender and Goldfarb. An example is the one by David Levy that associated an adopted child's lack of social emotion to her early emotional deprivation. Bowlby himself was interested in the role played in delinquency by poor early relationships, and explored this in a study of young thieves. Bowlby's contemporary Rene Spitz proposed that "psychotoxic" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care. A strong influence was the work of James Robertson who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film "A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital" illustrating the impact of loss and suffering experienced by young children separated from their primary caretakers. This film was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visiting by parents. 
In his 1951 monograph for the World Health Organization, "Maternal Care and Mental Health", Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment" and that not to do so may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This proposition was both influential in terms of the effect on the institutional care of children, and highly controversial. There was limited empirical data at the time and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.
Attachment theory.
Following the publication of "Maternal Care and Mental Health", Bowlby sought new understanding from such fields as evolutionary biology, ethology, developmental psychology, cognitive science and control systems theory and drew upon them to formulate the innovative proposition that the mechanisms underlying an infants tie emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure. He realised that he had to develop a new theory of motivation and behaviour control, built on up-to-date science rather than the outdated psychic energy model espoused by Freud. Bowlby expressed himself as having made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" in "Maternal Care and Mental Health" in his later work "Attachment and Loss" published between 1969 and 1980.
Bowlby's first official representations were carried out for the relationship theory in three very controversial lectures in 1957 by the British Psychoanalytical Society in London. The formal origin of attachment theory can be traced to the publication of two 1958 papers, one being Bowlby's "The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother", in which the precursory concepts of "attachment" were introduced, and Harry Harlow's "The Nature of Love", based on the results of experiments which showed, approximately, that infant rhesus monkeys spent more time with soft mother-like dummies that offered no food than they did with dummies that provided a food source but were less pleasant to the touch. Bowlby followed this up with two more papers, "Separation Anxiety" (1960a), and "Grief and Mourning in Infancy and Early Childhood" (1960b). At about the same time, Bowlby's former colleague, Mary Ainsworth was completing extensive observational studies on the nature of infant attachments in Uganda with Bowlby's ethological theories in mind. Mary Ainsworth's innovative methodology and comprehensive observational studies informed much of the theory, expanded its concepts and enabled some of its tenets to be empirically tested. Attachment theory was finally presented in 1969 in "Attachment" the first volume of the "Attachment and Loss" trilogy. The second and third volumes, "Separation: Anxiety and Anger" and "Loss: Sadness and Depression" followed in 1972 and 1980 respectively. "Attachment" was revised in 1982 to incorporate more recent research.
Ethology.
Bowlby's attention was first drawn to ethology when he read Lorenz's 1952 publication in draft form although Lorenz had published much earlier work. Soon after this he encountered the work of Tinbergen, and began to collaborate with Robert Hinde. In 1953 he stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests". 
Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "imprinting" and felt that it might have some parallels to human attachment. Imprinting, a behavior characteristic of some birds and a very few mammals, involves rapid learning of recognition by a young bird or animal exposed to a conspecific or an object or organism that behaves suitably. The learning is possible only within a limited age period, known as a critical period. This rapid learning and development of familiarity with an animate or inanimate object is accompanied by a tendency to stay close to the object and to follow when it moves; the young creature is said to have been imprinted on the object when this occurs. As the imprinted bird or animal reaches reproductive maturity, its courtship behavior is directed toward objects that resemble the imprinting object. Bowlby's attachment concepts later included the ideas that attachment involves learning from experience during a limited age period, and that the learning that occurs during that time influences adult behavior. However, he did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment, nor assume that human development was as simple as that of birds. He did, however, consider that attachment behavior was best explained as instinctive in nature, an approach that does not rule out the effect of experience, but that stresses the readiness the young child brings to social interactions. Some of Lorenz's work had been done years before Bowlby formulated his ideas, and indeed some ideas characteristic of ethology were already discussed among psychoanalysts some time before the presentation of attachment theory.
Psychoanalysis.
Bowlby's view of attachment was also influenced by psychoanalytical concepts and the earlier work of psychoanalysts. In particular he was influenced by observations of young children separated from familiar caregivers, as provided during World War II by Anna Freud and her colleague Dorothy Burlingham. Observations of separated children's grief by René Spitz were another important factor in the development of attachment theory. However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds. He rejected both Freudian "drive-theory", which he called the Cupboard Love theory of relationships, and early object-relations theory as both in his view failed to see the attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality. Thinking in terms of primary attachment and neo-darwinism, Bowlby identified as what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis, namely the overemphasis of internal dangers at the expense of external threat, and the picture of the development of personaltiy via linear "phases" with "regression" to fixed points accounting for psychological illness. Instead he posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.
Internal working model.
The important concept of the internal working model of social relationships was adopted by Bowlby from the work of the philosopher Kenneth Craik, who had noted the adaptiveness of the ability of thought to predict events, and stressed the survival value of and natural selection for this ability. According to Craik, prediction occurs when a "small-scale model" consisting of brain events is used to represent not only the external environment, but the individual's own possible actions. This model allows a person to mentally try out alternatives and to use knowledge of the past in responding to the present and future. At about the same time that Bowlby was applying Craik's ideas to the study of attachment, other psychologists were using these concepts in discussion of adult perception and cognition.
Cybernetics.
The theory of control systems (cybernetics), developing during the 1930s and '40s, influenced Bowlby's thinking. The young child's need for proximity to the attachment figure was seen as balancing homeostatically with the need for exploration. The actual distance maintained would be greater or less as the balance of needs changed; for example, the approach of a stranger, or an injury, would cause the child to seek proximity when a moment before he had been exploring at a distance.
Behavioural development and attachment.
Behaviour analysts have constructed models of attachment. Such models are based on the importance of contingent relationships. Behaviour analytic models have received support from research. and meta-analytic reviews.
Developments.
Although research on attachment behaviors continued after Bowlby's death in 1990, there was a period of time when attachment theory was considered to have run its course. Some authors argued that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organizing principle with varying behaviors resulting from contextual factors. Related later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans. In a recent study conducted in Sapporo, Behrens, et al., 2007 found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main & Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification. 
Interest in attachment theory continued, and the theory was later extended to adult romantic relationships by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Peter Fonagy and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship by way of such aspects of cognitive science as mentalization, the ability to estimate what the beliefs or intentions of another person may be. A "natural experiment" has permitted extensive study of attachment issues, as researchers have followed the thousands of Romanian orphans who were adopted into Western families after the end of Nicolae Ceauşescu's regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, has followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption and new relationships, and the physical and medical problems associated with their early lives. Studies on the Romanian adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, have in fact yielded reason for optimism. Many of the children have developed quite well, and the researchers have noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development.
Effects of changing times and approaches.
Some authors have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. The implication of this connection is that attachment-related experiences (and perhaps attachment itself) may alter as young children's experience of care change historically. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers and being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries, and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and even gained some legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.
One focus of attachment research has been on the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late 20th century, during which the deleterious effects of day care were stressed. As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to follow through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than was the case in the past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be different today than it was in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time. 
Finally, any critique of attachment theory needs to consider how the theory has connected with changes in other psychological theories. Research on attachment issues has begun to include concepts related to behaviour genetics and to the study of temperament (constitutional factors in personality), but it is unusual for popular presentations of attachment theory to include these. Importantly, some researchers and theorists have begun to connect attachment with the study of mentalization or Theory of Mind, the capacity that allows human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions, and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression or eye movement. The connection of theory of mind with the internal working model of social relationships may open a new area of study and lead to alterations in attachment theory.
Reception.
1950s to the 1970s.
The maternal deprivation hypothesis, attachment theory's precursor, was enormously controversial. Ten years after the publication of the hypothesis, Ainsworth listed nine concerns that she felt were the chief points of controversy. Ainsworth separated the three dimensions of maternal deprivation into lack of maternal care, distortion of maternal care and discontinuity of maternal care. She analysed the dozens of studies undertaken in the field and concluded that the basic assertions of the maternal deprivation hypothesis were sound although the controversy continued. As the formulation of attachment theory progressed, critics commented on empirical support for the theory and for the possible alternative explanations for results of empirical research. Wootton questioned the suggestion that early attachment history (as it would now be called) had a lifelong impact.
In 1957 found the young relationship theory in the DDR (East Germany) by an essay of James Robertson in the "Zeitschrift für ärztliche Fortbildung" (magazine for a medical further education) and Eva Schmidt-Kolmer carried out some journal extracts from Bowlby's essay "Maternal Care and mental Health" for WHO. In the following period it came to extensive comparative development psychological in the DDR at the end of the fifties. Examinations between family-bound babies and small children, day and week hayracks-as well as Institution children. The findings could do with regard to the morbidity for the family-bound children, the physical and emotional development as well as adaption disturbances at change of environment. After the construction of the Berlin Wall 1961 it didn't come to any additional publications in the DDR Relationship theory and comparative investigations with family-bound children. The previous ones Research results weren't published further and got like the relationship theory into oblivion in the DDR in the subsequent years.
In the 1970s, problems with the emphasis on attachment as a trait (a stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with important organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to consider that "attachment (as implying anything but infant-adult interaction) be said to have outlived its usefulness as a developmental construct..." and that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. Children may achieve a given function, such as a sense of security, in many different ways and the various but functionally comparable behaviours should be categorized as related to each other. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept (the organisation of exploration of an unfamiliar situation around returns to a familiar person) as "central to the logic and coherence of attachment theory and to its status as an organizational construct." Similarly, Thompson pointed out that "other features of early parent-child relationships that develop concurrently with attachment security, including negotiating conflict and establishing cooperation, also must be considered in understanding the legacy of early attachments."
Specific disciplines.
Psychoanalysis.
From an early point in the development of attachment theory, there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with the various branches of psychoanalysis. Like other members of the British object-relations group, Bowlby rejected Melanie Klein's views that considered the infant to have certain mental capacities at birth and to continue to develop emotionally on the basis of fantasy rather than of real experiences. But Bowlby also withdrew from the object-relations approach (exemplified, for example, by Anna Freud), as he abandoned the "drive theory" assumptions in favor of a set of automatic, instinctual behaviour systems that included attachment. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on problems similar to those he addressed. Bowlby was effectively ostracized from the psychoanalytic community. More recently some psychoanalysts have sought to reconcile the two theories in the form of attachment-based psychotherapy, a therapeutic approach.
Ethology.
Ethologists expressed concern about the adequacy of some of the research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalisation to humans from animal studies. Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that these concepts as used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself.
Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment, and offered alternative approaches. For example, crying on separation from a familiar person was suggested as an index of attachment. Observational studies of young children in natural settings also provided behaviours that might be considered to indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects and bringing them to the mother, but usually not other adults. Although ethological work tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, work like that just described led to the conclusion that "e appear to disagree with Bowlby and Ainsworth on some of the details of the child's interactions with its mother and other people". Some ethologists pressed for further observational data, arguing that psychologists "are still writing as if there is a real entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures."
Robert Hinde expressed concern with the use of the word "attachment" to imply that it was an intervening variable or a hypothesised internal mechanism rather than a data term. He suggested that confusion about the meaning of attachment theory terms "could lead to the 'instinct fallacy' of postulating a mechanism with the behaviours, and then using that as an explanation for the behaviour". However, Hinde considered "attachment behaviour system" to be an appropriate term of theory language which did not offer the same problems "because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour."
Cognitive development.
Bowlby's reliance on Piaget's theory of cognitive development gave rise to questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) and its connection to early attachment behaviours, and about the fact that the infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seems to occur some months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible. More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be far more specific than those of Bowlby's time.
Behaviourism.
In 1969, Gerwitz discussed how mother and child could provide each other with positive reinforcement experiences through their mutual attention and therefore learn to stay close together; this explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment. Learning theory saw attachment as a remnant of dependency and the quality of attachment as merely a response to the caregivers cues. Behaviourists saw behaviours such as crying as a random activity that meant nothing until reinforced by a caregivers response therefore frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists view. In the last decade, behaviour analysts have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of contingent relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research and meta-analytic reviews.
Methodology.
There has been critical discussion of conclusions drawn from clinical and observational work, and whether or not they actually support tenets of attachment theory. For example, Skuse based criticism of a basic tenet of attachment theory on the work of Anna Freud with children from Theresienstadt, who apparently developed relatively normally in spite of serious deprivation during their early years. This discussion concluded from Freud's case and from some other studies of extreme deprivation that there is an excellent prognosis for children with this background, unless there are biological or genetic risk factors. The psychoanalyst Margaret Mahler interpreted ambivalent or aggressive behaviour of toddlers toward their mothers as a normal part of development, not as evidence of poor attachment history. 
Some of Bowlby's interpretations of the data reported by James Robertson were eventually rejected by the researcher, who reported data from 13 young children who were cared for in ideal circumstances during separation from their mothers. Robertson noted, "...Bowlby acknowledges that he draws mainly upon James Robertson's institutional data. But in developing his grief and mourning theory, Bowlby, without adducing non-institutional data, has generalized Robertson's concept of protest, despair and denial beyond the context from which it was derived. He asserts that these are the usual responses of young children to separation from the mother regardless of circumstance..."; however, of the 13 separated children who received good care, none showed protest and despair, but "coped with separation from the mother when cared for in conditions from which the adverse factors which complicate institutional studies were absent". In the second volume of the trilogy, "Separation", published two years later, Bowlby acknowledged that Robertsons foster study had caused him to modify his views on the traumatic consequences of separation in which insufficient weight was given to the influence of skilled care from a familiar substitute.
Some authors have questioned the idea of attachment patterns, thought to be measured by techniques like the Strange Situation Protocol. Such techniques yield a taxonomy of categories considered to represent qualitative difference in attachment relationships (for example, secure attachment versus avoidant). However, a categorical model is not necessarily the best representation of individual difference in attachment. An examination of data from 1139 15-month-olds showed that variation was continuous rather than falling into natural groupings. This criticism introduces important questions for attachment typologies and the mechanisms behind apparent types, but in fact has relatively little relevance for attachment theory itself, which "neither requires nor predicts discrete patterns of attachment." As was noted above, ethologists have suggested other behavioural measures that may be of greater importance than Strange Situation behaviour.
1980s on.
Following the argument made in the 1970s that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organising principle with varying behaviours resulting from contextual factors, later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans. Various studies appeared to show cultural differences but a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main & Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification. 
Recent critics such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan are generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism (Nature versus nurture) and stress the possible effects of later experience on personality. Building on the earlier work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory etiology was based, arguing that heredity was far more important than the transient effects of early environment, for example a child with an inherent difficult temperament would not illicit sensitive behavioural responses from their care giver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not bourne out Kagan's argument and broadly demonstrates that it is the caregivers behaviours that form the child's attachment style although how this style is expressed may differ with temperament.
Harris and Pinker have put forward the notion that the influence of parents has been much exaggerated and that socialisation takes place primarily in peer groups, although H. Rudolph Schaffer concludes that parents and peers fulfill different functions and have distinctive roles in children's development.
Concern about attachment theory has been raised with regard to the fact that infants often have multiple relationships, within the family as well as in child care settings, and that the dyadic model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences.

Aislinge Meic Con Glinne

Aislinge Meic Con Glinne (Middle Ir.: The Vision of Mac Conglinne) is a Middle Irish tale of anonymous authorship, generally believed to have been written in the late 11th/early 12th century. A parody of the "Vision" genre of religious text, it has been described as the "best major work of parody" in the Irish language.
Text.
The tale exists in two manuscript versions, one (sometimes referred to as B) in the fifteenth century collection "Leabhar Breac" ("Speckled Book"), and the other (known as H) in a manuscript dating from the sixteenth or seventeenth century. The two versions have significant differences.
Synopsis.
The "Vision" is the story of Aniér MacConglinne, a scholar from Armagh, and his efforts to rid King Cathal mac Finnguine of a "demon of gluttony" that lived in Cathal's throat. One day, MacConglinne decides to abandon scholarship and become a poet, because "o spend his life studying was wretched." He decides to visit Cathal, then travelling around Munster, since he is hungry and has heard that Cathal is well supplied with "whitemeats", i.e. dairy products. MacConglinne packs up and travels across the country in a single night, arriving in Cork in the evening. He stays in a dilapidated guesthouse attached to a monastery, where his singing of psalms disturbs the people of Cork. The monks bring him meagre rations, and MacConglinne composes a satire on them, whereupon he is seized, stripped naked and whipped. The abbot, Manchín, proposes crucifying the unrepentant poet; MacConglinne complains that they have shown him no hospitality whatever and curses them as "curs, robbers and shit-hounds". The monks decide to defer crucifying him until the following day, but that night MacConglinne is visited by an angel of God, and is granted a vision of a land made entirely of food:The fort we reached was beautiful,<br>With works of custards thick,<br>Beyond the loch.<br>New butter was the bridge in front,<br>The rubble dyke was wheaten white,<br>Bacon the palisade.<br><br>Stately, pleasantly it sat,<br>A compact house and strong.<br>Then I went in:<br>The door of it was dry meat,<br>The threshold was bare bread,<br>cheese-curds the sides.<br><br>Smooth pillars of old cheese,<br>And sappy bacon props<br>Alternate ranged;<br>Fine beams of mellow cream,<br>White rafters - real curds,<br>Kept up the house. The next day he tells the monks about it and Manchín says that the vision is the only thing that will cure King Cathal of his gluttony. If MacConglinne will communicate the vision to King Cathal, the monks will not kill him for making satires about them. MacConglinne somewhat sulkily agrees, and duly travels to meet Cathal and his entourage.
Cathal is still the helpless victim of his gluttony, and MacConglinne is only able to get the king's attention by grinding his teeth so loudly that "there was no one in the neighbourhood [...] that did not hear the noise". He manages to get Cathal to give him an apple, the first time in three and a half years that the king has offered food to anyone else. MacConglinne provokes Cathal into giving him more and more apples, ultimately persuading the king to fast with him. After MacConglinne has got the king to fast for two consecutive nights, he prepares a vast meal of roasted meats and has Cathal lashed to the walls of his palace. Then he taunts the demon of gluttony by passing bits of roast meat before Cathal's mouth and eating them himself. Cathal roars for MacConglinne to be killed, but none of his men obey. MacConglinne relates to Cathal his vision of the land made of food, going into more and more detail about his adventures there, until "the lawless beast that abode in the inner bowels of Cathal MacFinguine came forth, until it was licking his lips outside his head." MacConglinne traps the demon under a cauldron and has the king's men evacuate the palace of all people and property, then he has the palace set on fire. The demon escapes to the roof of the house and MacConglinne demands that it "do obeisance", i.e. bow down to them. The demon replies defiantly:I have been three half-years in Cathal's mouth, to the ruin of Munster and the Southern Half besides, and if I were to continue three half years more, I should ruin all Ireland. MacConglinne threatens the demon with the Gospels, and it flies "into the air among the people of hell." Cathal rewards MacConglinne for curing him, and the tale concludes with a list of rewards owed to anyone who is able to recite it in its entirety.

Carnley Harbour is a large natural harbour in the south of the Auckland Islands, a subantarctic part of the New Zealand Outlying Islands. Formed from the drowned crater of an extinct volcano, the harbour separates the mainland of Auckland Island from the smaller Adams Island. The harbour is sometimes referred to as the "Adams Straits".
The harbour is undeveloped (the Auckland Islands are uninhabited), and has three major arms: North Arm, Musgrave Bay, and Western Arm. Of these, the first two are deep indentations in the coast of Auckland Island; the last connects with Victoria Passage to form a channel separating Auckland and Adams Islands.

Haseley Manor

Haseley Manor is a 14th-century, Grade 2* listed property located in Arreton on the Isle of Wight.
The name Haseley is derived from the Saxon Haesel-leah meaning hazel wood, and the first record appears in 1086 in the Domesday Book, with Haseley being previously owned by King Harold, the unfortunate loser at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.
Part of the south wing contains Norman timber carved by the monks of Quarr Abbey in 1139 and Haseley claims to be the oldest house on the Island. Past owners have included four kings, Harold, William I, William II and Henry VIII, it was also the home of the judge, Sir Thomas Fleming, who tried Guy Fawkes.
In 1537 Thomas Wriothesley obtained a grant of it from the Crown, and sold it next year to John Mill of Southampton, whose son George made it his residence in the reign of Elizabeth. Here, Sir John Oglander notes, he 'kept a brave house and lived worshipfully.' From him the manor passed in the same way as Binstead (q.v.) to the Fleming family of North Stoneham Park, and as of 1912 belonged to Mr. John E. A. Willis-Fleming. According to Sir John Oglander the house, pleasantly situated in the low ground to the north of Horringford station, was practically rebuilt by the Mills. 
By 1976 Haseley was derelict and overgrown with ivy. It has been restored over a 25 year period by Mr. Raymond Young and is now a Grade II* listed building and the private residence of Mr. & Mrs. Anthony Roberts

California Rare Fruit Growers Association

The California Rare Fruit Growers Association (CRFG) is an organization of rare exotic fruit enthusiasts, hobbyists and amateur horticulturists based in California. The CRFG, founded in 1968, promotes rare fruits in the Southern California marketplace, according to a 1997 article in the "Seasonal Chef" online newsletter. As of 2008 the CRFG has 3,000 members in approximately 35 countries with 20 Chapters in Western US and is said to be the largest amateur fruit-growing organization in the world.
History.
The California Rare Fruit Growers was co-founded by Paul Thomson and John Riley in 1968. Thomson was a self-taught botanist and fruit farmer based in San Diego's North County, while Riley was an engineer with Lockheed from Santa Clara, California. Both Thomson and Riley shared an enthusiasm for rare fruits and plants which had not been previously widely cultivated in California. Riley and Thomson soon began collaborating to publish a newsletter on tropical and subtropical fruits using a mimeograph machine. In 1968 they expanded operations to found the CRFG. Membership was swelled by a rapid influx of newcomers to California who were "without prejudice to what could not be grown" in the state.
Publication.
The CRFG publishes a bimonthly magazine called "The Fruit Gardener", an outgrowth of the early newsletters published by Thomson and Riley.
Annual Meeting.
CRFG members and the public meets every year to celebrate the "Festival of Fruit", an event organized by different Chapters. This event includes seminars, workshops, local tours and plant sales.

Movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf

The movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf was an August 2008 attempt by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), Awami National Party (ANP), and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam to force Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf out of office.
Background.
On November 3, 2007, President and then-Chief of the Army Staff Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency, postponing indefinitely the elections for the National Assembly of Pakistan that were initially scheduled to take place on January 8, 2008. The emergency announcement also contained news of the dismissal of Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, widely considered to have been motivated by a prediction that the Supreme Court was about to invalidate Musharraf's October reelection as President of Pakistan in uniform. This action, combined with a broad-based pro-democracy movement occurring in Pakistan at the time, led to a precipitous fall in Musharraf's popularity. Following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani Election Commission announced that the election would occur on February 18. The elections were won by the PPP and the PML-N, two parties hostile to Musharraf and his Pakistan Muslim League (Q) party.
Details.
On August 7, 2008, the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (N) agreed to ask Musharraf to get the Vote of Confidence from the National and Provisional Assemblies or step down, and began his impeachment. Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif announced that the two parties would be sending a joint request asking that Musharraf step down, and that they would impeach him through the parliamentary process if he refused. Musharraf, however, said, "I will defeat those who try to push me to the wall. If they use their right to oust me, I have the right to defend myself." Upon hearing the news, Musharraf delayed his departure for the Beijing Olympics by a day, and it was later announced that he would be replaced at the opening ceremonies by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani. The government summoned the National Assembly for a session on August 11 to begin the impeachment proceedings. Capt. Wasif Syed, spokesman for the Pakistan People's Party, confirmed the announcement, saying, "A decision has been made that he has to go now, and all the parties have agreed on this point." To impeach Musharraf, the ruling coalition will need a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, and it is not certain that they control the required number of votes. Musharraf still has the option to fight his impeachment by dissolving parliament, although doing so could cause a backlash, and he would likely need the support of Pakistan's army to be successful.
Zardari announced on TV that the impeachment would be under s.47 of the Pakistani Constitution. This provides the process for impeachment, but he did not mention the grounds. The 2007 impeachment proceedings, which led to the imposition of emergency rule, were based upon the provisions prohibiting the President of Pakistan from holding "an office of profit" from the Pakistan Government. Although many of the people no longer support Musharraf, some have emphasized the positive points of Musharraf's Presidency.
Pakistan's ruling coalition, on August 16, gave Musharraf a Tuesday, August 19 deadline to resign. Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Musharraf must resign to avoid being impeached "by today or tomorrow, as there is no room for any delay". Defense Minister Ahmed Mukhtar announced that "the charge sheet will be presented in parliament by Tuesday." No president has ever been impeached in Pakistan's 61-year history. Presidential aides, however, said Musharraf refused to leave office under pressure. Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman Asif Zardari said that the next president of the country may very well be a woman, denying he was a presidential candidate: "I would have become the prime minister if I wished to become president." Nawaz Sharif said: "I am not personally interested. It should go to a person who actually enjoys the support of the people of Pakistan. I think best would be somebody from Balochistan of course there is a sense of deprivation in the province of Balochistan, perhaps that will be a better choice."
Resignation.
On August 18, 2008, in a speech defending his record, Musharraf announced that he will resign In the August 18 negotiations which failed over the legal technicalities, he sought immunity from prosecution if he resigns before the impeachment proceedings. On asylum, Condoleezza Rice on "Fox News Sunday" said that "Musharraf would not be going to the United States. This is an issue that is not on the table." Musharraf stated he will stay in Pakistan in a house he is building in an exclusive enclave in Islamabad near a golf club.
Musharraf, 65, announced his resignation, in a 1 p.m. televised address to avoid impeachment: "After viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies, with their advice I have decided to resign. I leave my future in the hands of people. Not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me. No charge can be proved against me because I never did anything for myself, it was all for Pakistan. On the map of the world, Pakistan is now an important country, by the grace of Allah. Whether I win or lose the impeachment, the nation will lose. They don’t realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage. My resignation will go to the speaker of the National Assembly today." In an emotional 1 hour speech, Musharraf raised his clenched fists to chest height, and said, "Long live Pakistan!" Nasir Ali Khan, a senior member of the Pakistan Muslim League-N, said Musharraf will stay in Pakistan, a request he had insisted on. Meanwhile, the Constitution provides that a new president must be chosen within 30 days. The resignation permits the 4-month-old coalition government to choose a new president by a vote of the Parliament and provincial assemblies. US-based Newsweek magazine reported that "the president would 'fly into exile in Saudi Arabia, where he is to remain for the next three months."
The British "Daily Telegraph" reported an unnamed Western diplomat as saying that, after a pilgrimage to Mecca, Musharraf might settle in London.
Presidential election.
Pakistan's Election Commission on August 22 announced that Presidential elections will be held on September 6, and the nomination papers can be filed from August 26. The president is elected by the 2 houses of parliament and the 4 provincial assemblies.
Exile.
President Pervez Musharraf went into exile on Saturday 23 November 2008. He arrived in London on Sunday 24 November 2008

Background.
Hollowman Giggs followed up his hype which was built from the freestyle "Talking The Hardest" by releasing this album, which he claims to have completed in two weeks.
The album was very well received, gaining positive reviews across the UK .
Giggs released a video for the song "Uummm!!" for promotion before the album was released, however MTV Base refused to play the video due to claims that the content was too strong for their channel.
Giggs was not happy with the company, retracted his video application and wrote the tune "The Last Straw" in response to the bad treatment he received from MTV Base and BBC 1Xtra. When asked about the issue he said he was asked to censor "drug references" from the song, despite none being made.

George Naʻope

George Lanakilakekiahialii Naope (February 25, 1928 - October 26, 2009), born in Kalihi, Hawaii, was a celebrated kumu hula, master Hawaiian chanter, and leading advocate and preservationist of native Hawaiian culture worldwide. He taught hula dancing for over sixty years in Hawaii, Japan, Guam, Australia, Germany, England, North America, and South America.
Naope was a scholar of ancient hula, which is hula developed and danced before 1893. He first studied hula at three years old under his great-grandmother, Mary Malia Pukaokalani Naope, who lived to be over 100 years old. At the age of four he began to study with Mary Kanaele, the mother and teacher of Edith Kanaka'ole. When he moved to Oahu at the age of ten, he studied for ten years with Joseph Ilalaole. After graduating from high school, Naope moved to Honolulu where he opened the George Naope Hula School, then later continued his studies under Kumu Hula Lokalia Montgomery and Tom Hiona.
Naope began to teach hula at the age of thirteen. His family was poor, so he taught hula for fifty cents per week in order to continue to pay for school. He taught chant and kahiko to the Ray Kinney dancers, and traveled with Ray Kinney.
In 1964, Naope founded the Merrie Monarch Festival, an annual week-long festival of traditional Hawaiian arts, crafts, and performances featuring a three-day hula competition. The festival became both a popular success and an important part of the Hawaiian Renaissance. In an interview Naope said of founding the festival, "I felt the hula was becoming too modern and that we have to preserve it. David Kalakaua of Hawaii, 1874–91; aka "The Merrie Monarch" brought the hula back to Hawaii and made us realize how important it was for our people. There was nothing here in Hilo, so I decided to honor Kalakaua and have a festival with just hula. I didn't realize that it was going to turn out to be one of the biggest things in our state."
Naope was honored with numerous other awards, including being named a Living Treasure of Hawai'i by the Buddhist temple Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai'i, "Treasure of Hawaii" by President George W. Bush and the Smithsonian Institution and receiving the National Heritage Fellowship Award by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2006.
Death.
Naope also founded the "Humu Moolelo", a quarterly journal of the hula arts. Until his death from cancer on October 26, 2009, aged 81, he resided in Hilo, Hawaii, and attended many hula festivals where he was considered a "living treasure".

Words of Uncle George Na`ope.
None of us sees the world through a blank slate or by seeing what is “actually there”, we focus on the world through an esthetic prism. The way we represent the world arises through our social fabric, of language, myth, history, attitudes, and ways of doing things. Our world-view is a cultural pattern that shapes our mind from birth, as fate. It varies from culture to culture. Then with imagination and vision we weave our own reality as we become a cooperating strand in the social web.
I was born on February 25, 1928, in Honolulu in Kalihi. My full name is George Lanakila-keiki-ahi-ali‘i Na‘ope. The name means “the light that would lead the way” or “the protector of things of Hawai‘i”. Not knowing what I do today, my great-grandmother, Mary Malia-Puka-o-ka-lani Na‘ope, named me before I was born. Most of the Hawaiians named their people, the way she named me. My great-grandmother, my grandpa’s mother, was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Lili ‘uokalani. She lived to be over 100 years old. By her account our lineage goes back to the House of Keawe at Hookena and Pa‘ao a well-known cornerstone figure in Hawaiian history and reformer of the Hawaiian priesthood of the 11th century. 
My family is a musical family number one. My grandfather, Harry Na‘ope, was a very famous music conductor and composer of several beautiful Hawaiian songs including Hawai‘i No Aakaoi, Manu O‘o, and Hilo E. 
In the old days, children were selected at a young age to devote their lives to the hula. They were dedicated to Laka, goddess of the hula. They lived sequestered for years in their halau under the strict teachings of the kumu hula who was a master and teacher of the hula arts. It was not until they graduated, often in their teens, that they were even allowed to mingle with anyone outside their halau. They were not to be tainted by any other influence. Hula dancers do not live that way any more. My great grand mother knew of these customs and she raised us in a very Hawaiian household where we spoke Hawaiian and gave us a foundation in the ways of old Hawaii and oral traditions.
While I was a baby, I came to Hilo with my parents to live with my great grand mother. I was educated there at Keaukaha School. I began to learn Hula at the age of three. In those days no one studied the hula, not openly, anyway, since hula was still underground. My first kumu was a woman who lived next door to my family in Hilo, Mary Kanaile who was the mother of Edith Kanakaole. She was married to a Japanese man so we called her Mama Fujii. She was a short lady, but she was a master of the hula. I studied under her for five years. I will always remember her and consider her to be my kumu hula because she did the hard work of giving me my foundation and my basics. That is the hardest thing to teach. Mama Fujii was my great-grandmother’s very dear friend and that is the reason I was sent to her to learn hula. My great-grandmother told me that our kupuna were kumu pa‘a so she felt that someone should carry on the tradition and learn the old ways. She didn’t dance hula. So, it wasn’t really a matter of me having a choice about learning or not learning. My great-grandmother was friends with all of the great hula masters of her time and they came to see her quite often. That is why they took me under their wing as I got older.
I never knew I was going to be a hula teacher. Because when I was little, I hated the hula. I was forced to go for four or more hours every day and I couldn’t go play. Mama Fujii was very strict. It was six days a week, hula after school, thank God for Sunday -gotta go church. That was our day off. It wasn’t until later that I realized how great a teacher Mama Fujii was. She spoke fluent Hawaiian and she had a deep love and feeling for the hula. 
At first, I mostly learned to chant. Then one day when I was about seven or eight years old, she told me: “It’s your turn to dance.” I didn’t think I could dance. I sat through all those years listening to the dancers getting yelled at. I was glad I was not dancing. I didn’t realize I knew all of the dances. I had watched all those years and had chanted and beat the drums. Every time someone made a mistake we had to start again so I was watching closely and hoping they would get it right. In dancing, Mama Fujii taught me only kahiko but since she was a Christian she only talked about the kapu during hula training and there was no kuahu. We always did Christian prayers before and after we danced. She also taught us the noho (sitting) dances. 
Then at the age of ten, I began to learned to dance from the master Joe ‘Ilala‘ole who was from Hilo but lived in Puna. I studied under him for a while, about ten years until he left for Honolulu to become a policeman. He taught me the kapu and all the training from the olden days. We had to chant a password to enter the halau and if it was correct, he would answer your chant and let you in. 
My family was poor so I began to teach in 1942 when I was thirteen-years-old. This Japanese lady, Mrs. Tsubaki was retiring from the barbershop business in Hilo so she took out all the chairs and let me use her shop to teach hula. I only taught kahiko. It wasn’t until about ten years later that I added modern style hula to my lessons. I charged fifty cents a week and with that money I was able to get through school.
I began my recording career at the age of twelve making records with popular companies of the time, 49th State and Tropical Recordings. In my junior year I went to Farrington High School because I was working at the Niumalu Hotel and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel with Ray Kinney, his Royal Hawaiian Review. 
During that time, I met a lot of people. Oh, lots of people. The Royal Hawaiian, oh everybody. Bing Crosby. I became good friends with Sammy Davis and all of them. You know, and Dorothy Lamour, Bob Hope. Gene Autry. Dale Evans and Roy Rogers. Elvis. We toured widely in the U.S. and Europe with the Royal Hawaiian Review, which also recorded several 78-rpm disks. We spent a long time in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles. We were there during vaudeville days, playing the Trivoli Theatre and Palomar, you know, all in Denver and all over, and Colorado Springs, Vancouver, Calgary, Lake Louise, Canada. All over. Of course, we did Las Vegas. But also in New York. We spent a long time with Arthur Godfrey. We used to be all, we were the main attraction. You know they have like Sammy Davis and all these people, then the Hawaiian show, the Royal Hawaiian Review at the Tropicana.
Then, when they closed up, I came back and finished high school at Hilo High. After graduating from Hilo High School, I studied under Aunty Anna Hall who taught me chanting and aunty Jennie Wilson who taught me ‘auwana. Aunty Jennie had a very sedate way of moving her hands. She taught me that the hands tell the story so nothing can be kuikau. Every hand movement had to be a definite motion.
After high school, I moved to Honolulu and opened the George Na`ope Hula School. I was teaching kahiko when almost no one else would. To me the hula was serious. Hula had religious aspects that were not popular at that time. I was very strict. I tried to get my students to make the connection to the heart. King David Kalakaua said, "Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people." I always tried to honor that idea in my teaching since he was instrumental in reviving hula, which had been banned by the missionaries. He also hosted many gala events and festivals at Iolani Palace during his reign. I was inspired by his style and the efforts that he made to bring back the Hawaiian traditions before it was too late. It wasn’t easy in those days, those who had the knowledge and were willing to share were often looked down on by both sides.
I was also teaching hula to the inmates of O`ahu and Kulani prisons as well as in multi-ethnic, less privileged communities on O`ahu such as Kamehameha IV and Mayor Wright Housing areas. Sometime after that I was picked as a chanter by Ray Kinney who was a world famous Hawaiian singer on the mainland – he called and I joined his show. I stayed with him for two years. Then I came back and went to the Niumalu Hotel called Hilton Hawaiian Village as a chanter with master teacher Tom Hiona, and also I learned Hula from Uncle Tom. I stayed with Uncle Tom for a while. 
Later I went under grand master of tutoring Lokalia Montgomery. She was one of the best teachers of all the teachers I had but she was really tough. She was 400 something pounds and had a very old house with big windows. One day I said: “Aunty, can I ask you a question? When I dance all the windows shake.” She said: “A very simple answer: You’re stupid. You’re not good yet, that’s why.” So that answered that. She’d be chanting while she was typing another chant Then she would pull it out of the typewriter and say “Okay, here is the next one you learn.” Then we would have to copy every word down ourselves. And get it correct. She would then sit us down and we would have to read them before we danced. She would tell us the meaning of all these things we had written down. That way you would never forget. I still do that with my students. They learn the words first, then the chant and then the dance.
I speak my mother tongue, and I teach it to my students. How else are they going to learn the hula if they don’t know what they are dancing about. I also like to take them to the different places that the songs are written about. I make them dance it right there so they can feel the words. Verse by verse. Then when they do it in a show or somewhere else, they can imagine how beautiful or cold or windy it is. And that’s the way they are going to really learn it. Especially the language. Even in Japan they have to learn all of the Hawaiian words. 
Aften Lokalia Montgomery I learned from Tom Hiona. I learned the various different styles from all of these great masters – they were some of the finest teachers in Hawai’i. Chanting I learned from Daddy Bray, and what kind of costumes, you know. I’m very, very fortunate to have learned under all these people. I was lucky that I was able to live at the time when all of these masters were alive. And I was so fortunate to be able to take hula from most of them. 
I chanted for Harriet ‘Iolani Luahine for many years, and learned a few numbers from her. She was not my teacher, but I had the privilege of being her close friend and chanting for her on various occasions in shows and pageants on Hawai‘i Island and on O’ahu. She was very special to me. I knew her all my life from when I was little. I would sit for hours with her and she would tell me stories. Auntie was a great artist. She was a dancer of genius. I think she was the best hula dancer of modern times. When she danced I’d get so engrossed in her dancing that I would get into a trance. I’d be drumming and watching her and I’d forget the beat. She lived the hula. It was her life. She was very mystical a kind of priestess, an enchantress. But she was also very funny, spontaneous and flamboyant. Aunty ‘Io never danced a song the same way. She created as she went along. As soon as she started to dance her whole body would change and the movements would just flow. Everyone would sit in awe. She danced for six presidents; she danced at the White House.
Her name means “heavenly bird” or bird (‘io) of heaven (lani). Every year in the beginnings of the Merrie Monarch she would open the Festival for me. Every year I would chant and she would dance. Birds would come into the stadium. The ‘io from volcano came. Her gift of hula will long be remembered and that is why I wanted to start the ‘Iolani Luahine Hula Festival and Scholarship Competition, to perpetuate the memory of ‘Iolani Luahine and her contribution to the preservation of hula and Hawaiian culture. E mau loa aku e ‘Iolani. And to remember those gifts she left for all of us to perpetuate. By offering a hula scholarship award each year, the festival makes sure that one dedicated student will be encouraged and has the ability to continue the study of hula. and that the legacy of hula lives on by providing this opportunity for world-wide halaus to participate and learn. I know she would like that.
She died in 1976. But right up until the end, when she was dying of cancer, she lived her off-the-cuff, invent-each-moment style. On her last night she spent in her home in Napo‘opo‘o village, she decided to invite about thirty people for a small party. She had just come in that morning from the Honolulu hospital, but between the airport and Napo‘opo‘o she invited ...well, 135 people came. After she died, I came to live in her house and stayed their for ten years. Sometimes people say, “Your just like Auntie ‘Io”. I wish I was, but I’m not. When our creator created her, He broke the mold. But I guess I learned to fool around like her and I like to make fun. 
I went to the University of Utah. Graduated from there. Then I went to Oberlin Conservatory of Music and graduated from the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music with a doctor’s degree in music. And I came home to teach hula. I went to teach school at the University— I don’t want to mention the name, but anyway I taught school for six years. My major was music but I taught anthropology, which was not for me. I didn’t want to dig up anybody’s grave or anything. So anyway, I did that.
I was drafted into the Korean War. In 1952, After serving twenty-four months in front-line combat as a member of the 10th Corps of the American Corps of Engineers, I returned to Hawai`i and that’s when I went into the modern hula. None of the teachers were teaching kahiko they weren’t really interested in it. If anything else, they taught Tahitian. So it looked kind of weird if you didn’t do the things the rest of them were doing. Although I kept teaching ancient hula the emphasis was on the modern hula. Then you had “Lovely Hula Hands” and “Beyond the Reef” and “Little grass Shack.” Its modern hula but to me it wasn’t Hawai‘i.
I try to be fair to other teachers and other teaching styles. In fact, in Hula the first thing you must teach is respect. First, respect for yourself, because if you have respect for you, you will have respect for the next person. Rule number two from the old days says ‘A‘ohe I pau ka ‘ike I ka halau ho‘okahi – “Think not that all wisdom lies in your school.” So you have no time to criticize the next person. Especially since so much was lost and fragmented. The teachers that carried it on were often in remote parts of the islands and separated from each other. I am so grateful that they thought it important enough to save the little we still have. 
Even in the old times different areas evolved differently just like the plants. Even though they may have the same base each location and the isolation that is Hawai‘i provides for diversification and uniqueness. And there are different points of view. Like more than one-side to the story. That’s what keeps things interesting. I teach my students, if you see somebody dance and you think its junk or not right, you pa‘a ka waha, “keep your mouth shut” and enjoy it because you know how hard it is to learn. Everybody has his own way of teaching. Its wonderful to take from other teachers. Because every teacher has something that another teacher doesn’t have. And we all have our own style. The hula to me is the ability to create one’s inner most feelings and no one else’s. When learning a hula about the deep love of the composer for his wife and the place that they fell in love, one of my dancers said to me “Although I have never been to that place, I can remember the place where I fell in love with my husband, and when I am dancing I just imagine that and it helps me express the feeling.” 
I was appointed “Promoter of Activities” with the County of Hawai‘i under the Hale Administration. I served in this capacity for four years. It was during this time, 1962 that the Merrie Monarch Festival was born. Hilo had no real attractions so the mayor asked me to come up with an idea. I went to Maui with Gene to watch the Whaling Spree in Lahina. It was a lot of drinking and I knew we couldn’t do that in Hilo where everyone goes to church. Come Monday morning when the mayor asked what our plan was, off the top of my head I suddenly said: “We’re going to have a King Kalakaua Festival” –divine inspiration. David Kalakaua was a popular monarch because he tried to renew respect for Hawaiian culture, particularly hula and chant. He was also known for his love of socializing and celebrations. That’s how he came by the title “The Merrie Monarch.”
Also in this period, I was honored to be recognized by the Governor and Hawai‘i State Legislature of 1960 with the designation of “Living Golden Treasure.” The hula had been lost for about 75 years as a public performance. Kalakaua sent couriers out all over the islands to seek out all of the practicing kumu hula. He knew where they were hiding. He invited them all to his coronation. That brought back interest in all these dances. 
During the first three years of the “Merrie Monarch Festival I had a big show –150 people were in the cast. It was more of a play where we acted out Kalakaua’s coronation. Hula came after. It wasn’t the main attraction and it wasn’t a competition. Later on it was the kumu hula themselves that wanted competition. The halau all came, but almost none knew ancient hula. Only three out of the twenty-six halau. Later, I sent everybody a tape of chanting and drumming, and then it became a competition. Everybody doing the same chant but creating their own motions. I did that for nine or ten years; after that, I got tired of it and told them that from now on they had to do their own thing. Now they are all so good.
I am really a purist when it comes to kahiko. It probably comes from the years of listening to my teachers correct and start over when things were not done precisely. I really want to keep kahiko traditional. I am kind of a stickler for that. The kahiko is of the old. It is the history of Hawai‘i, the chants. So how can we add anything into it. In my learning, you could not improvise. In oral tradition it is important to keep things exact so that you didn’t change the story. 
I went on to create the Lili‘uokalani Keiki Hula Festival, the experience from which the Kalihi-Palama Cultural and Arts Society was formed. Next came the Kalakaua Invitational Hula Festival, followed by the Kupuna Hula Festival. In 1981 I began the Japan Merrie Monarch Hula Festival” to afford hula education to my Japanese students. It’s now in its ... Successful year and has become an annual summer event attracting thousands of worldwide participants.
While living at Napo‘opo‘o at Iolani Luahine’s home, we helped set up a Foundation along with our Princess Abigail Kawananakoa – it’s called the Luahine-Kawananakoa Foundation.
Besides entertaining and teaching hula, I began cataloging many of the old chants – taping many of the chants, taping the stories and backgrounds of these chants for the future, you know, for anybody to use when they want to. This is what the Foundation is all about. I did an album on chants that hadn’t been recorded so that they’ll be saved for posterity. We’re still taping all of these chants and, pageantries and Hawaiian temple dances and just putting them all down on record. It’s a good thing that we have a tape recorder because it’s faster than writing them down. 
In the 1970s, I was a member of the Honokohau Advisory Commission and served as a charter member of that group that has guided the creation of the 750-acre Kaloko Honkohau National Park in Kekaha, Kona. Aunty ‘Iolani, David Kahelemauna Roy In the wake of urban development and land use patterns that were taking place in North Kohala, we saw the unique opportunity to provide a new dimension to visitor experience and at the same time, help maintain the integrity of the Hawaiian culture. Although it has not been followed exactly as we proposed. I am so proud to have been an integral part of the decision-making process and that our work resulted in the site being set aside and will be preserved under the National Historical Park designation. It was one of the first times that native Hawaiians were able to tell their story and tell it in their own way. I was recently shown the draft of the
In 1993, I co-authored a book in two volumes entitled “The Lost Secrets of Ancient Hawaiian Huna”. 
I love to share my culture. The hula is the one of the only things we have left of our own. Teaching it the same way that you were taught helps to keep it alive. My students come from different races and religions but it doesn’t bother me at all. No matter what race or what color, when they dance the hula they are Hawaiian. I have taught for and helped to organize groups such as Hui O Na Kumuhula in the Northwest U.S. as well as groups in California and New York. Over the years I have also taught the dance of Hawai‘i in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, London, Guam, Okinawa, Korea, Australia, and Tahiti. You know, it’s so wonderful, I have my friends from Germany, from Berlin. I also taught in Heidelberg, Frankfurt, Munich and Brenan. I have a friend who comes from Berlin who makes the best sauerkraut. I like traveling and I like sharing the hula. And you know, I still return annually to several mainland locations and many of these countries, to help with their local competitions and renew the skills of my students. 
I have taught in Japan for since the early 1960s. I still don’t know how to speak Japanese. People ask “Uncle, how do you teach the Japanese how to dance?” I say “Very simple. I teach them in Hawaiian.” I like their culture, but their culture is also fading. It’s so Americanized and Westernized. They’re losing their Japanese dancing. I like traditional Japanese dance. Their kahiko is almost like ours. The Japanese study hard and they work hard. They know it is not their culture but they love it.
One halau I go to in Japan has 5,000 students. There was a big write-up in the paper with my picture in it that said the hula is the best thing for older people for exercise. The doctors say it is good for then to keep limber. After that, 2,000 people signed up to take from my teachers. 
I was recognized in 1960 by the state as a "Living Golden Treasure” and in 1999, I was nominated as a National Treasure by Councilman, Curtis Tyler and the Hawai`i Island County Council. Then in 2006, I was honored by the National Endowment for the Arts with an NEA National Heritage Fellowship Lifetime Honors award. I was very proud to be recognized but even more proud that I had dedicated my life to my Hawaiian culture and helped to ensure its place in the world’s annals of heritage. I just love Hawaii and I love my culture. My greatest gift is the ability to share the hula with people around the world and to see that they enjoy it and feel the aloha.
At the age of 78, I was still actively teaching and entertaining. I became passionately committed and actively pursuing the creation of a hula archive that would preserve the many songs, chants and dances of Hawai’i through recordings and exhibits. Although it has still not become a reality, I hope that it will someday be a place for people to gather and learn about the hula.
I studied with the great masters. But, I never thought I would be a kumu hula. I never thought that one day they would recognize me as one of the masters of the hula and a historian of the Hawaiian culture. I just happened to be around at the right time when there were still some of them who were trained in the old ways. It was not very popular at that time like it is now. It’s my people and it reflects me. Its my life. 
At the hour of Uncle's death a whistling wind blew in across Keaukaha bringing with it the Kani lehua, the rain that sings upon the lehua began to fall all across Hilo. This is the simple but awesome power of love. We celebrate your wonderful life and our love for Hawaii's Culture. Mahalo no e Ke Akua. Aloha no e na kupuna.

Lies (McFly song)

"Lies" is the fifteenth single from British pop rock band, McFly, released on 15 September 2008. "Lies" did not feature on the promotional 10-track copy of the album "" which was given away in "The Mail on Sunday" in July 2008, however it features as one of the four additional tracks on the retail edition of the album, which was released on 22 September 2008. The lead vocals for the song are split between band members Danny Jones and Tom Fletcher, with vocal contributions from bassist Dougie Poynter. "Lyrically, Lies is definitely the darkest song we've ever written," says Tom Fletcher, who shares vocals on the track with Danny Jones. "It's about a real bitch of a girl who is out for herself and doesn't care who she uses to get what she wants. We did have a girl in mind when we wrote it, but really it's an amalgam of several girls we have met along the way. We hope she burns in hell at the end. A real good time tune then!" On 17 September 2008 the song was added to BBC Radio 1's A-List and BBC Radio 2's A-List. Lies debuted at number No. 4, it sold 26,071 in UK singles charts in its first Physical Release Week. Just 7 copies behind Pussycat Dolls, 'When I Grow Up'. "Lies" has received a platinum sales status certification for sales of over 170,000 copies in the Brazil (Only in downloads). "Lies" also features on the compilation CD Now That's What I Call Music! 71 and The song appears on the international soundtrack to the Brazilian telenovela Caminho das Índias.
Video.
The full music video is just over 6 minutes long, and received its premiere on Channel 4's teen strand, T4 on 23 August 2008, and Brazil its premiere on MTV Brasil on 7 October 2008. The video, directed by the duo Chris Hopewell and Ben Foley.
The music video takes place in an apocalyptic world where water is scarce and therefore a source of power.
The opening monologue of the video.
"Now We have only the memories, of a green and pleasant land that lies below the countless fathoms. The lifeless seas, filthy and reeking, crept up on mankind, inch by inch. Slowly his clever water powered world ground to a halt. Brother fought Brother, Nation fought Nation. But there are those who flourish in this blight of times, they cleanse the water. Make it pure again. For a Price. Only the strong and the quick survive, living off their animal cunning, always mobile in the endless search of the life bringing water. In their cities of fire and steel, these all powerful water barons, now run the world. Holding all to ransom in a firestorm of fear."
In the start of the video, it starts with a monologue as the band are in a water powered van in the vast and lonely landscape.
However the van grinds to a halt as the water cells that power the van have stopped working as they ran out of water. They then push their van towards the closest civilization they can find. However being watched by one of the water barons.
As they then reach the city, they are met with some of the security and guides to bring them around the city to get what they are looking for however throughout the path, they encounter different people and surroundings as they get pushed along towards to where they need to get the cleaned water. Once they get to where they are needed they get stopped by the Water baron of the city and they get sent off to be at the stage as a way of "payment". Then the boys are on a stage performing as everything is made from loads of scrap objects. They then had enough of performing and then get into a fight with some of the members of the Barons gang. Initially they beat them away only leaving Tom and the baroness to fight it off. It seemed the baron would have won however Tom defeats the baroness. In the light of a celebration however, a big chainsaw wielding thug comes out. The boys then decide it's best to leave as they take whatever they can and fuel up. They then leave in their van, however by the end of the video the van breaks down on their escape.
The video ends as the baroness and the chainsaw thug go after them as the screen quickly blacks out. Unsure if the boys have escaped. The baroness is played by Jo-Emma Larvin.

Most isolated mountain peaks of Canada

The following sortable table lists the 100 most topographically isolated major mountain peaks of Canada.
Topographic elevation is the vertical distance above the reference geoid, a precise mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface. Topographic prominence is the elevation difference between the summit and the highest or key col to a higher summit. Topographic isolation is the minimum great circle distance to a point of higher elevation.
This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least 100 metres (328.1 feet) of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least 500 metres (1640.4 feet) of topographic prominence. An ultra-prominent summit is a summit with at least 1500 metres (4921.3 feet) of topographic prominence.
Of these 100 most isolated major summits, 57 are located in British Columbia, 14 in Nunavut, 11 in Yukon, 6 in Newfoundland and Labrador, 5 in Alberta, 5 in Quebec, 4 in the Northwest Territories, and 1 each in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Three of these summits lie on the border between Alberta and British Columbia and one lies between British Columbia and Yukon. Two of these summits lie on the international border between British Columbia and Alaska.
The first 52 of these summits each have at least of topographic isolation and at least of topographic prominence.

<doc id="18757163" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18757163" title="Sinicization of Tibet">
Sinicization of Tibet

The sinicization of Tibet is a term used by some critics of Chinese rule in Tibet to refer to the cultural assimilation that have occurred in Tibetan areas of China (including Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan-designated autonomous areas) which have made these areas more closely resemble mainstream Chinese society. They say that these changes have been most evident since the incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China in 1950/51 and have been facilitated by a broad range of active economic, social, cultural and political reforms introduced to Tibetan areas by the Chinese Government over the last six decades. Critics also point to the government-sponsored migration of large numbers of Han Chinese into the Tibet Autonomous Region as a major component of sinicization.
The government of Tibet in exile alleges that the consequence of Chinese policies is the disappearance of certain elements of Tibetan culture, which has sometimes been very controversially termed "cultural genocide". It says that these policies intend to make Tibet an integral part of China in order to control any desire for Tibetan self-determination. 
On the other hand, the Chinese government argues that its policies have been highly beneficial to Tibet and that any cultural and social changes are the inevitable consequences of modernization. It says that Tibet's economy has expanded and that improved basic services and infrastructure projects have led to significant improvement in quality of living among Tibetans, while the Tibetan language and culture have been protected.
History.
Early developments.
In the decades preceding 1950, after the collapse of Qing Dynasty, the region roughly corresponding to the modern-day Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) was a "de facto" independent nation. It also printed its own currency and postage and conducted international relations with foreign countries. It claimed three provinces Amdo, Kham, and Ü-Tsang (but had only control of west Kham and Ü-Tsang). Since 1950, China reorganized the area somewhat, by making east Kham part of Sichuan, and west Kham part of the newly established Tibet Autonomous Region.
During the Republic of China era following the fall of the Qing Dynasty in the early 20th century, the Chinese Muslim General Ma Bufang, warlord and Governor of Qinghai is accused by Tibetans of having carrying out Sinicization and Islamification policies in Tibetan areas, spreading along Chinese holidays like New Year and Chinese celebrations along with the Islamic religion and making them marry non Tibetans. Forced conversion and heavy taxes were reported under his rule.
China calls the entry of its army into Tibet in 1950 a "peaceful liberation"; the government of Tibet in exile calls it an "invasion" and "colonization". However, the Chinese government points to population increases and quality of life improvements as justifications for their assertion of power in the historically Chinese-claimed region.
Prior to the invasion, the economy of Tibet was dominated by subsistence agriculture. Thus, the stationing of 35,000 Chinese troops in the 1950s weighed heavily on the food supplies in Tibet. At Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama's visit to Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1954, Mao informed him that he would migrate 40,000 Chinese farmers to Tibet.
In the 1960s, as part of Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward, Chinese authorities forced Tibetan farmers to cultivate maize instead of barley, the traditional crop of the Himalaya region. However, like many of the policies implemented during the Great Leap Forward, the decision proved to be disastrous, resulting in the failing of the harvest and the starving of thousands of Tibetans.
Cultural Revolution.
The Cultural Revolution was a revolution involving students and laborers of the Chinese communist party that was initiated by Mao and was carried on by the Gang of Four between 1966 and 1976 with the intention of preserving Maoism as the leading ideology of China. It was an inter-party struggle to eliminate political opposition against Mao.
The Cultural Revolution affected the whole of China and Tibet suffered greatly as a result. Red Guards attacked civilians who were branded traitors to communism. More than six thousand monasteries were looted and destroyed. Monks and nuns were forced to leave their monasteries to "live a normal life", while those who resisted were imprisoned. Prisoners were forced into hard labor, tortured, and executed. The Potala Palace was nearly harmed, but the intervention of Premier Zhou Enlai prevented the Tibetan Red Guards from causing damage.
Recent Developments.
China's "National Strategic Project to Develop the West", launched in the 1980s following the end of the Cultural Revolution, encourages the migration of Chinese people from other regions of China into Tibet, luring them there with attractive bonuses and favorable living conditions. Often, people volunteer to be sent there as teachers, doctors and administrators to assist in the development of Tibet. Citing the low quality of the labour force and less-developed infrastructure, the Chinese government has encouraged an in-flow of migrants to stimulate competition and to transform Tibet from a traditional planned economy to a market economy in line with the rest of China.
Since the end of the 1990s, ethnic Tibetans have become a minority in the "Greater Tibet" as claimed by Tibetan exile groups; as of 2003, the population consisted of an estimated 6 million ethnic Tibetans and 7.5 million non-Tibetans of different ethnic groups. However, they remain the majority ethnic group by a wide margin in the Tibet Autonomous Region proper, comprising around 93% of the population in 2008.
The 2008 attacks by Tibetans on Han- and Hui-owned property were alleged to be due to the large Han Hui influx into Tibet. George Fitzherbert has said that "Tibetans complain of being robbed of their dignity in their homeland by having their genuinely loved leader incessantly denounced, and of being swamped by Chinese immigration to the point of becoming a minority in their own country."
The Chinese government has put significant resources into the development of Tibet in recent years as part of the China Western Development policy. In 2009, the Chinese government invested over $3 billion into the region, 31% more than was invested in 2008. One of the most significant investments is the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, completed in 2006 at a cost of $3.68 billion, leading to an increase of tourists coming from the rest of China. The Shanghai government contributed $8.6 million to the construction of the Tibet Shanghai Experimental School, where 1500 Tibetan students receive an education exclusively in Chinese, with the exception of Tibetan language courses. Some young Tibetans feel that they are both Tibetans and Chinese and are fluent in both Tibetan and Mandarin.
Population Growth.
In 1949, there were between 300 and 400 Han Chinese residents in Lhasa. In 1950, the town covered fewer than three square kilometres and harboured around 30,000 inhabitants. The Potala Palace and the village of Zhöl below it were considered separate from the city at the time. In 1953, according to the first population census, Lhasa numbered about residents, including beggars and not counting the monks.
By 1992, Lhasa's permanent population was estimated at a little under people, including Tibetans, Han Chinese and sundry. Added to that figure are perhaps and temporary residents, for the most part Tibetan pilgrims and traders. In 2008, Lhasa had people, with a majority still being Tibetan.
Controversy.
In 1989, Robert Badinter, a high-profile French criminal lawyer, participated in an episode of "Apostrophes", a well-known French television program devoted to human rights, in the presence of the 14th Dalaï Lama. Talking about the disappearance of the Tibetan culture in Tibet, Robert Badinter used the term "cultural genocide". Subsequently, for the first time in 1993, the Dalaï Lama used the same term to describe the destruction of the Tibetan culture. More recently, at the time of 2008 Tibetan unrest, he accused the Chinese of Cultural genocide in their crackdown.
In 2008, Professor Robert Barnett, director of the Program for Tibetan Studies at Columbia University, stated that it was time for accusations of cultural genocide to be dropped: "I think we have to get over any suggestion that the Chinese are ill-intentioned or trying to wipe out Tibet." He also voiced his doubts in a book review he published in the "New York Review of Books":"Why, if Tibetan culture within Tibet is being 'fast erased from existence', so many Tibetans within Tibet still appear to have a more vigorous cultural life, with over a hundred literary magazines in Tibetan, than their exile counterparts?"

John Murphy (loyalist)

John Alexander Thompson Murphy (26 August 1950 – 10 August 1998) was a loyalist from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He was one of the three leading men in the "Shankill Butchers", an Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) murder gang. 
Early life.
Murphy was the second of three sons born to William and Joyce Murphy, the others being William (eldest) and Hugh Leonard Thompson "Lenny" (youngest). Outside his paramilitary career, little is known about him, although Martin Dillon, author of a book on the "Shankill Butchers", wrote that John and William acted as muscle to their younger brother when the latter was engaged in petty crime at school.
Paramilitary activity.
According to Dillon, John Murphy was party to the murder of rival loyalist Noel "Nogi" Shaw on 30 November 1975. After being shot in a loyalist drinking-den, Shaw's body was thrown into a laundry basket and dumped in an alleyway. He played an important role in passing orders to the "Butchers" from his brother Lenny, after the latter's imprisonment in March 1976. 
Other than being convicted, along with several of the "Butchers", with an assault on a man which occurred on 11 April 1977, John Murphy was never charged with involvement in the activities of the Butchers.
Later life and death.
After Lenny's assassination, his elder brothers returned to domestic life in the Shankill. Martin Dillon wrote that the two brothers were overheard discussing the possibility of killing him (Dillon) for what he wrote about them in his book, "The Shankill Butchers: a case study of mass murder".
In 1998, Murphy's nephew William, son of his brother William, was arrested and remanded in prison for the murder of a 78-year-old in the Shankill Road area. His nephew was convicted of murder in January 1999 and received a life sentence. A suspended sentence was imposed on William Murphy (the elder) for possession of ammunition uncovered during a search of the family home in Battenberg Street. 
Death.
John Murphy died on 10 August 1998 in a car crash at the junction of the Grosvenor Road and the Westlink in Belfast.

In the new competition's first season, Manningham finished on top of the ladder, becoming history's first rugby league champions.
In 1886, the club moved to Valley Parade, a ground that was hacked out of a hillside over a few months. In the 1896-7 season the Northern Union's championship was split into two separate county competitions with Manningham competing in the Yorkshire division. The club performed strongly again and almost won the Yorkshire Senior Competition but in the end fell short on the table by just one win.
However, the club fell upon hard times after being relegated, and in 1903 only the successful staging of an archery tournament kept the club going.
On 30 January 1903, Scotsman James Whyte, a sub-editor of the "Bradford Observer" met with Football Association representative John Brunt at Valley Parade, the home of Manningham Football Club, to discuss establishing a Football League club within the city. A series of meetings was held, and on 29 May 1903, at the 23rd annual meeting of Manningham FC, the committee decided to leave the rugby league code and switch to association football, becoming Bradford City A.F.C..
Notable former players.
F. Lorriman, and A. Barker of Manningham played in The Rest's 5-7 defeat to Leeds in the 1901–02 Yorkshire Senior Competition Champions versus The Rest match at Headingley Stadium on Saturday 19 April 1902.

Pentre

Pentre is a village and community, near Treorchy in Rhondda valley, falling within the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales. The village's name is taken from the Welsh word Pentref, which translates as homestead, though Pentre is named after a large farm that dominated the area before the coming of industrialisation. The community takes in the neighbouring village of Ton Pentre.
Early and industrial history.
Pre-1850, the area which is now Pentre was made up of several scattered farms tended by tenant farmers for absentee landlords. With the discovery, in the early 19th century, of economically viable coal deposits in Dinas Rhondda it was not long until expeditions reached the mid valleys. In 1857 Edward Curteis of Llandaff leased the mineral rights of Tyr-y-Pentre from Griffith Llewellyn of Baglan and soon had two levels opened, the Pentre and Church. During the early part of 1864 deeper shafts had been sunk by the Pentre Coal Company. The mines in the Pentre were some of the most profitable of all the collieries in the Rhondda.
By the early 20th century, Pentre was a busy town and the main shopping area for the upper Rhondda and was also the centre for local government, with the local council offices built in Llewellyn Street in 1882. Pentre is also home to St Peters Church (1890), the 'Cathedral of the Rhondda', the largest religious building in either valley.
Two of the most notable businesses to have existed in the Rhondda were both formed in Pentre; the Pentre Breweries and the Rhondda Engine Works.
Sport and leisure.
The town also shares its border with the village of Ton Pentre, which is home to Ton Pentre Football Club, who currently play in the Welsh Football League First Division (second tier) and were members of the highest league in Welsh football - the League of Wales - from 1993 until resignation from this division in 1996. Despite winning six Welsh Football League First Division title since then, they have not been promoted back to the League of Wales due to financial difficulties as well as the inadequacy of their facilities at Ynys Park.

Daisy Turner (storyteller)

Daisy Turner (June 21, 1883 – February 8, 1988) was an American storyteller and poet. Born in Grafton, Vermont to freed slaves, she became famous late in life for her oral recordings of her family's history, which can be traced back to Africa and England.
Biography.
Daisy Turner's father, Alexander Turner was a slave who escaped from his plantation at the start of the Civil War, and joined the 1st New Jersey Cavalry of the Union Army. In the spring of 1863, Turner guided his regiment to his old plantation in Port Royal, Virginia, where he killed his former overseer.
After military service, he returned to New England where he worked as a logger. He and his wife Sally had a homestead in Grafton, Vermont where they raised 16 children. His strength was prodigious, and the Grafton Storekeeper once bet that if Alex carried a one hundred fifty pound barrel of flour home (uphill and over three miles) without setting it down he could have it for free. Alex went ahead and did so to feed his family but at the same time he was followed by forty or so men who carried their own "little jugs of jimmyjohn and hard cider... and after they all got up, they all got drunk." (Beck)
A powerful presence, Daisy Turner was proud of her heritage, and was a strong, outspoken woman from childhood to her death at the age of 104. She is remembered as a gifted storyteller and family historian. The Turner family homestead (they had 13 children in all) is located on the "Daisy Turner Loop", a biking trail near Grafton Pond.
She had been a "striking beauty in her youth, with high cheekbones and deep-set eyes" (Beck) and led an exciting life, many of the details of which have been recorded carefully. Daisy can be seen reciting Civil War poetry, at the remarkable age of 104, in Ken Burns' critically acclaimed PBS documentary, "The Civil War". One of Turner's favorite personal stories, which she recounted often, involved a school pageant when Turner was about eight years old. In the pageant, Turner's teacher had instructed Turner to recite a poem with a black doll, but at the last minute, Turner resisted and spontaneously made up her own poem. This story became the subject of a children's book by Michael Medearis and Angela Shelf Medearis, and receives scholarly attention in "Racial Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Slavery to Civil Rights," by Robin Bernstein. Daisy Turner's story continues to attract wide attention as part of an effort to preserve the folk history of Vermont and the United States.

<doc id="18757334" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18757334" title="The Fascinations">
The Fascinations

The Fascinations were an American pop vocal group most active in the mid-1960s. They are best remembered for the Curtis Mayfield-penned hit "Girls Are Out To Get You", a minor pop hit in the US in 1967 that was re-released in the UK in 1971, where it reached the top 40.
History.
Early years (1960-1963).
The group was formed in 1960 by Shirley Walker and Martha Reeves, who originally planned on calling their group The Sabre-ettes. Sisters Joanne and Bernadine Boswell joined the group through an audition process. Fern Bledsoe joined the group right around the time they changed their name to The Fasinations (sic).
Before the group got its chance at recording, in late 1960 founding member Reeves left over disagreements with the other members. Reeves went on to re-join her previous group, The Del-Phis. This group signed to the Motown Records label, and later became Martha & The Vandellas. Bernadette Boswell would be the Fas(c)inations' lead singer from this point on.
In late 1962, The Fasinations were signed to the ABC-Paramount label. There they met Curtis Mayfield (of The Impressions) who wrote and produced their first single, "Mama Didn't Lie", a track he had previously cut with Jan Bradley. While the track was initially issued as by The Fasinations, the group quickly changed their name to the more conventionally spelled "The Fascinations", and subsequent pressings of this single (and all future singles) were accordingly credited to The Fascinations.
Bradley's version of "Mama Didn't Lie" had been a regional hit, but had not broken nationally when The Fascinations recorded their version. However, Bradley's recording of "Mama" began to take off nationally just as the Fascinations released their record. As it turned out, Bradley's recording of "Mama Didn't Lie" entered the Billboard charts in the first week of 1963, while The Fascinations version of the same song debuted in the "Bubbling Under" charts one week later. Bradley took "Mama Didn't Lie" all the way to #14; The Fascinations' version stalled at #108.
The group then followed up with "Tears In My Eyes", which flopped, and ABC dropped them from their label roster.
Hiatus (1964-1965).
The Fascinations continued to rehearse and make club appearances over the next few years, but also had to take on other jobs to make ends meet. Bledsoe worked as a secretary at Motown Records, and also sang lead on two 1964 singles by obscure girl-group The Aprils (the second credited to "Fern and the Aprils"). 
Walker, under the name "Shirley Lawson", also issued two obscure solo singles during these years.
Return to recording (1966-1968).
After a gap of a few years, The Fascinations found themselves back in the studio with Curtis Mayfield—when Mayfield started his Mayfield Records label in 1966, one of the first acts he signed was The Fascinations. Their first single for that label was "Say It Isn't So"/"I'm So Lucky", taking its style from Motown. While the record did not make the Hot 100 chart, it was a hit on the R&B chart, eventually landing in the Top 50. 
Mayfield also wrote and produced their next single, "Girls Are Out to Getcha," which was their most commercially successful song: it reached #92 on the Billboard Hot 100, and on the R&B chart it climbed to #13. 
In mid-1967 the group's third Mayfield single, "I'm In Love," produced in similar fashion to "Girls Are Out to Getcha", became the group's third Top 50 single on the R&B charts. However, the group's follow-up release of "Hold On"/"Such A Fool" went virtually unnoticed, as did The Fascinations' final release on the Mayfield label, "Just Another Reason"/"Okay For You". The Mayfield label closed up shop with this release; Curtis Mayfield would have more success with his next label, Curtom.
In early 1968, label-less and with bookings for live appearances dwindling, The Fascinations decided to retire.
UK success, and a brief reunion (1971).
The group reunited briefly in 1971, after their 1966 single "Girls Are Out to Get You" became popular in England as a part of the Northern soul movement. Upon re-issue on the Polydor Records subsidiary Mojo label, "Girls Are Out To Get You" reached #32 in the UK Singles Chart in 1971
, and The Fascinations took advantage of this unexpected resurgence in their popularity and reformed for their first overseas tour. They have not reformed since.

Xu Lijia (; born 30 August 1987 in Shanghai) is a Chinese sailboat racer who won a bronze medal in women's Laser Radial class at the 2008 Summer Olympics and a gold medal in the same event at the 2012 Summer Olympics, where she was the flag bearer for China at the closing ceremony.
Early life and career.
Xu Lijia was born nearly deaf in an ear and nearly blind in an eye. She started swimming at age four and attended a sports school in Changning District of Shanghai. When she was ten Xu was chosen by coach Zhang Jing to train for sailing.
Just a year after she started sailing, Xu Lijia won the 1998 Chinese National Championships held in Hong Kong.
In 1999, when she was twelve, Xu Lijia narrowly escaped death in a sudden storm while training on the open sea off the coast of Fujian Province with her coach and teammates. Wind speed reached , resulting in high waves, capsizing their boats. They were stranded on the sea for more than two hours before managing to return to the base.
Optimist and Europe classes.
Xu Lijia began her international career aged 11 in the Optimist class in the 1998 Asian Championships, winning her first international gold medal in the 1999 Asian Championships. She then won the gold medals in the 2001 and 2002 World Championships, and the 2002 Asian Games, all in the Optimist class.
After she reached 15, in 2003 Xu progressed to the Europe class (then an Olympic class) according to International Sailing Federation (ISAF) rules. She switched to coach Liu Xiaoma, the husband of her old coach Zhang Jing.
Tumor.
During a routine physical examination before the 2004 Summer Olympics, doctors found a giant-cell tumor of bone near Xu Lijia's left knee. She initially hoped to postpone the tumor-removal surgery until after the Olympics, but doctors warned that the tumor could spread within months which would necessitate amputation of the leg. Xu underwent the surgery and missed the Athens Olympics.
Laser Radial class.
In 2005 Xu began racing Laser Radial class dinghies after the ISAF decided to replace the Europe class with Laser Radial in the women's sailing competition of the Olympics. The next year she won gold medals at the 2006 World Championships in Los Angeles and the 2006 Asian Games in Doha.
In March 2008 Xu Lijia won a silver medal at the World Championships in Auckland, New Zealand. In August she won her first Olympic medal, a bronze at the Qingdao regatta of the 2008 Summer Olympics, behind American sailor Anna Tunnicliffe and Gintare Volungeviciute of Lithuania.
After winning a gold medal at the 2009 Chinese National Games, Xu took a long break from the sport in order to recover from her back injuries and to commence her studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Business Management. She resumed training in May 2011 and won a silver medal in May 2012 at the World Championships held in Boltenhagen, Germany.
2012 Summer Olympics.
On 6 August 2012, Xu Lijia won the gold medal in the women's Laser Radial race at the 2012 Summer Olympics, beating Marit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands and Evi van Acker of Belgium. It was China's second ever Olympic gold in sailing.
Partly because of her inspiring story of overcoming multiple adversities to become an Olympic champion, Xu was chosen over many better known athletes to be China's flag bearer at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics.

Recovery Audit Contractor

The Recovery Audit Contractor, or RAC, program was created through the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) to identify and recover improper Medicare payments paid to healthcare providers under fee-for-service (FFS) . The United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is required by law to make the program permanent for all states by January 1, 2010 under section 302 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. 
History.
In section 306 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, the United States Congress directed the DHHS to conduct a three-year demonstration program to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare FFS program. DHHS, through its Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) branch, began the program in 2005, using Recovery Audit Contractors to perform the actual work of reviewing, auditing, and identifying improper Medicare payments. At the inception of the program, it focused on Medicare payments in the states of California, New York, and Florida. The program eventually expanded to Massachusetts and South Carolina before ending in March 2007. By the end of the demonstration, the program had recovered nearly $693.6M on behalf of CMS.
Jurisdictions.
The RAC program divides the United States into four jurisdictions (regions A through D), each comprising approximately one quarter of the country, and contracts are awarded for each region. Diversified Collection Services audits region A, CGI Group region B, Connolly, Inc region C, and HealthDataInsights region D. Each RAC may subcontract portions of its region. PRG Shultz subcontracts for portions of regions A, B and D. iHealth Technologies and Strategic Health Solutions are also subcontractors for region A, while Viant is a subcontractor for region C.
RACs are also active in other than government industries. Large players in this field are Connolly, PRGX and Transparent.

Chellberg Farm is significant as it represents the ethnic heritage of a nearly forgotten Swedish-American settlement. The farm includes a family home, water house with windmill, chicken coop/bunkhouse, and the original barn. Other nearby Swedish landmarks have been restored or preserved, including the Burstrom Chapel and the Burstrom Cemetery.
Architecture.
The Farmhouse.
Like many structures in this area, local labor and local materials were put to good use. The clay soils were turned into a thriving brick industry. the red brick facade is made of porter brick.
The Barn.
The barn is a three-bay structure with a gabled roof. It is by , standing tall. The construction is on four bents built using two by uprights. Two bents form the east and west ends, with the remaining two bents forming the center bay. The wood consists of a mix of oak, elm, ash, maple and basswood. Originally built on stone piers, Carl Chellberg added a concrete floor in 1938. The barn is located in an east-west alignment to provide maximum sun on the structure. It is also adjacent to the wood ravine, which helps block the winter winds.
Corncrib.
The south wall of the shed was shared with a tractor shed, which is now gone. The tractor shed housed the Chellbergs' 1939 Allis-Chalmers tractor. Once the tractor arrived, it was used instead of the horses for the harvest.
Granary.
A two-story, wood-framed building, just west of the farmhouse.
Maple sugar Camp.
Still in use each spring.

The Family.
The Kjellberg Arrival in AmericaAnders Ludwig Kjellberg (born March 22, 1830) and Johanna (Anderson) Kjellberg (born April 28, 1829) were married in Sweden in the 1850s. They emigrated to the U.S. in 1863 with their son, Carl (born 1859). Family tradition says that they immediately moved to the Bailly area. They did not set up a home on the current location. They first lived on Mineral Springs road, south of the tracks from the Swedish Lutheran Church.
The 1871 Great Chicago Fire destroyed much of the Swedish community in Chicago. Many Swedish residents choose to move to the Swedish community of Indiana. A popular story that is the Kjellberg family met Joel Wicker (the son-in-law of Joseph Bailly) while in Chicago and that Joel hired Anders to clean out brush in preparation for planting. Joel is said to have provided a small log house for the family.
Anders Kjellherg had been a tailor and a lay preacher the Lutheran Church in Sweden. He continued to place an emphasis on his religion after immigrating and helped to establish the Swedish Lutheran Church, now the Augsberg Lutheran Church. The Kjellbergs' second child, Carolyn, was born in the mid-1860s. She died at the age of three or four. The family also had a foster son, Simon Larson, who was born in 1874 and joined the family before 1880.
Arrival in Northwest IndianaIn October 1869 the family took legal title to the Chellberg Farm property. On November 1, 1869 the Kjellberg (Chellberg) family took possession of what is known as the Chellberg Farm. John Oherg and Anders Kjellberg represented the family in the purchase of from J. H. Wicker. It cost $12.00 per acre. They also paid off an older contract of Wicker's worth $1000.
There were no structures on the land, nor was it cleared for agricultural use. The 1870 Population and Agricultural Census. The family of four living on the property with only of improved land. No crops had been produce in their first year, but they had several animals, two milk cows, two other cattle and two swine. Their only farm production and possibly only source of income was 100 pounds of butter that had been produced. Meanwhile John Oberg’s farm also had improved and a higher production level, 10 bushels of Spring wheat, 25 bushels of Winter wheat adn1 bushels of Irish potatoes. The Obergs owned one swine, two milk cows and had produced 150 pounds of butter. There appears to be some confusion over whether the Chellbergs were actually on the ‘farm site’ or if it was the Obergs who were residents at the time of the census.
Clearing the land would have been a slow process. In a good year, they might be able to clear only per year. It’s more likely that they only cleared to a year. Clearing the land would produce sell-able lumber and cordwood, i.e., firewood. Most farms in the area were small and did a little of everything. The Chellbergs had an orchard which may have produced apples, pears, peaches, plums, cherries, grapes, strawberries, and raspberries.
The construction of the brick farmhouse in 1885 was a major addition to the farm. For many families the construction of a new, larger house would have indicated an improved level of prosperity, however, the Chellberg farmhouse was constructed as a direct result of the disastrous fire that consumed the original family home. The use of brick for the new house was more likely to be an attempt to guarantee that another fire would not threaten the family, than a display of a new level of wealth
Second Generation at the Chellberg Farm, 1893–1908 Kjellberg was 63 when he died on April 16, 1893. His son, C. L. Chellberg became the owner of the farm when he bought his mother's and sister's inherited interest. C. L. paid $3500 to the two and agreed to shelter and feed them for the rest of their lives. C. L. took a more scientific approach to farming. He read The Farm Journal for a year, considered alternative approaches to farming and courted Ottomina Peterson. His scientific approach was furthered, beginning in 1896 when he subscribed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farmer's Bulletins.
It is likely that C. L. Chellberg was in the process of developing the herd in 1901. After Emily Kjellberg married Alfred Borg in 1897, she and Alfred continued to live at the farm with their two children until 1901. Alfred was a carpenter and brick worker by trade so; he may have provided cash income by working off of the farm. In 1899 Johanna Kjellberg died at the age of 70. C. L. Chellberg and Emily and Alfred Borg continued to live in the farmhouse together until C. L. married Ottomina in 1901. Then, Emily and Alfred, with their children moved away. They lived with other relatives until ca. 1904 their home, Oak Hill Road and a ravine from the farm was completed.
Chellberg Dairy Farm, 1908–1937By 1908 the Chellbergs had switched from grain production to dairy and grain farm. The Chicago, South Bend and South Shore Railroad had been completed and a stop was only a mile away. With the daily train, they could sell milk to the dairy in East Chicago. Over the following years, the children of C.L. and Ottomina (Naomi and Carl) and their children continued to work on the farm. Naomi (1907–1988), moved away from the farm only after her marriage to Alden Studebaker in 1926. Even the grand children, Ann Chellberg Medley, daughter of Carl and Hilda Chellberg and Henry Studebaker and Arthur Studebaker, sons of Naomi Chellberg Studebaker and Alden Studebaker spent much of their childhood on the farm. Somewhere between 1920 and the 1930s, the dairy operation. It may have been when the South Shore closed its stop near farm or slowly over time as it became more difficult to get the milk to the train each day.
Third Generation at the Chellberg Farm, 1937–1972
. L. Chellberg's died in 1937. The farm was between his spouse and three children. His son Carl Chellberg took on the primary management of the farm, but everyone was actively involved in the decisions. They did not keep up with the changing economy as industry replaced farming as the mainstay of commerce. Like many farmers today (2008), he worked in town to make ends meet. Carl found employment in a machine shop in Chesterton.
In 1938, Carl married Hilda Johnson. They had two children. The remodeled second floor of the farmhouse was an apartment where they and children lived. Minnie Chellberg died on November 15, 1952 at the age of 82. Minnie managed the house gardens, both the v vegetable garden and the flowers in the front yard. She also oversaw the orchard. She also continued to raise chickens.
Sometime in the 1940s Carl Chellberg began raising sheep and kept about 60 head. The sheep were sold at auctions for meat. The sheep grazed throughout the entire farm property and were kept in two sheep sheds that were constructed during this period. A large extension was built onto the south side of the barn in 1954. It was constructed by Carl Chellberg, Henry Studebaker, and Arthur Studebaker. Another sheep shed was constructed behind the granary. The building was smaller than the barn addition and constructed of corrugated iron. Eventually (sometime in the mid to late 1950s) Carl Chellberg took a job a machine shop in Chesterton and sold the sheep. Hilda Johnson Chellberg worked as a cook at a local restaurant. Once both Carl and Hilda had jobs off of the farm, the farm operation became a secondary effort and no longer the main family business."
Circa 1940 electricity was reestablished at the farm. It was used until the utility company power was brought to the farm in the 1940s after the war." During 1943, 1944, and 1945, Henry and Arthur Studebaker grew vegetables at the farm for sale to local residents. They had a garden in the eastern portion of the field south of the orchard and north of the current visitor center parking lot. They grew vegetables to sell door to door in Dune Acres. They grew asparagus, lima beans, yellow and green snap beans, beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery (white), kale, leaf lettuce, endive, cantaloupe, watermelons, okra, green onions, leeks, parsnips, peas, green and red peppers, red, white, and sweet potatoes, radishes, rhubarb, spinach, red rhubarb chard and white Swiss chard, Jerusalem and butternut squash, red and yellow tomatoes, turnips, rutabagas, kohl robi, cicely, sweet corn (yellow bantam and country gentleman), horseradish, dill, sage, chives, and parsley.

Algeria–Greece relations

Algerian-Greek relations date back for more than 2000 years. Diplomatic relations have been solid since Algeria's first years of independence. Greece maintains an embassy in Algiers, and Algeria is represented in Greece by its embassy in Athens. Trade between Greece and Algeria is increasing, with imports of natural gas from Algeria an important factor. There have been problems with illegal immigration from Algeria to Greece in recent years, and with Algerian trafficking of Sub Saharan Africans seeking to enter the European Union.
History.
The first recorded contacts between Greeks and Algerians were struggles in the 5th century BC between the Phoenecians, who had settled in what is now Tunisia and Algeria with their capital at Carthage, and the Greek colony of Syracuse in Sicily. The capital of Numidia, Cirta (later renamed Constantine) was founded in 203 BC with the help of Greek colonists. The Greek historian Polybius discusses the wars that led to Carthage and Numidia becoming the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauretania.
After almost 600 years as part of the Roman Empire, the territory that is now Algeria was occupied by the Vandals in 428 AD. In 533-534, the Greek general Belisarius defeated the Vandals, and Africa became a province of the Byzantine empire. In 535, the Greek emperor Justinian I made Sicily a Byzantine province.
The Arab forces of Caliph Uthman invaded Sicily in 652, without success, although the Arabs managed to drive the Greeks out of North Africa between 670 and 711 AD. A serious assault on Sicily was launched in 740 from Carthage, where the Arabs had built shipyards and a permanent base from which to make more sustained attacks, again without success. In 826, Ziyadat Allah the Emir of Ifriqiya sent an army that conquered the southern shore of the island and laid siege to Syracuse, but was forced to abandon the attempt due to plague. In 831 Berber units captured Palermo after a year-long siege. Palermo became the Muslim capital of Sicily, renamed al-Madinah. Taormina fell in 902, but the Greeks clung onto territory in the island until 965.
In 1061, after a successful campaign against the Byzantines in the south of Italy, the Norman Robert Guiscard invaded the Emirate of Sicily and captured Messina. After a prolonged campaign, the Normans completed the conquest of Sicily by 1091. The Norman Kingdom of Sicily developed a vibrant culture, and became a gateway that opened the world of Greek philosophy and Muslim science to Western Europe. (Later the Normans went on to sack and occupy Constantinople itself in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade.)
After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, most of Greece was subject to the Ottoman Empire until its declaration of independence in 1821. Algeria also became a province of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, captured by the half-Turkish Oruç Reis, who established the Barbary Corsairs. Algeria remained nominally subject to the Ottoman empire until the French invasion of Algeria in 1830, but in practice was largely independent. The Barbary Corsairs, based in Algiers and other ports of the Barbary coast, were a severe threat to Mediterranean trade until their suppression in the early 19th century. Greek and Barbary pirates had close relations, with many Greeks sailing on Barbary ships.
Greece was among the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Algeria after its independence in 1962, by upgrading the then Greek Consulate General in Algiers to an embassy in 1963.
Official relations.
Diplomatic contacts.
The two Mediterranean countries have frequent high-level diplomatic contacts. In 1994, Algerian Foreign Minister Mohammed Salah Dembri visited Athens where he met his counterpart Karolos Papoulias and was received by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. They discussed bilateral relations and specifically discussed the Cyprus and
Skopje issues. The Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs visited Greece in February 2001, returning a previous visit paid by the Foreign Minister of Greece to Algeria. In July 2002 Greek Minister of Development Akis Tsochatzopoulos and Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil met to examine new ways of cooperation. In 2003, Greek Defence Minister Ioannos Papandoniou visited Algeria to discuss ways to consolidate military cooperation between Algeria and Greece. In March 2008 the Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited Algiers where she met with Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and agreed to boost bilateral economic cooperation. In a message to Greek president Karolos Papoulias, Bouteflika said he wished to develop and deepen relationships between the two countries and to consult over issues related to security in the Mediterranean region.
Bilateral agreements.
As of 2009, the two countries had in place 3 bilateral agreements:
Economic relations.
Since 2000, Algeria has supplied Greece with natural gas under a long-term agreement between the two countries. The liquefied natural gas is transported by special vessels to the Revithoussa LNG Terminal to the west of Athens. The exports of Algerian products to Greece amounted to $89 million in 2001, including mainly oil and oil derivatives, natural gas, inorganic chemicals, iron and steel. In the same year, Greek exports to Algeria amounted to $50.78 million, consisting mainly of cereals and related derivatives, tobacco products, pharmaceuticals, medical and non-ferrous minerals. By 2006, total trade volumes had risen to US$410.2 million. In 2007, Algeria was ranked 6th among Greece's Arab trade partners.
In 2008, a high-ranking delegation of Algerian government and business officials from sectors such as ports management, construction, public works, banking and finance as well as energy, and around 60 Greek delegates held a forum on Greek-Algerian economic cooperation in Athens.
Migration.
As Spain and Italy are taking increasingly tough measures to restrict illegal migrants from the Middle East and Africa, growing numbers are entering the EU through Greece. In 2007, Greece arrested 112,000 illegal immigrants, up from 40,000 in 2005. The influx of illegal migrants is causing rising violence in Athens. Newly arrived refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa are being exploited by established gangs of Nigerians, Moroccans and Algerians, who engaged in street battles in downtown Athens in 2008. In May 2009, 500 illegal immigrants in Athens, mostly from Algeria and Tunisia, were besieged by a crowd of Neo-Nazi Greeks inside an abandoned eight floor building with no water and electricity. Earlier in the year, Turkish police arrested a group of 120 Algerian illegal immigrants who were trying to cross the border into Greece. The Turkish town of Adana has become a popular transit point for Algerian illegal immigrants.
Algeria is also a staging post for trade in migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. Department of State describes Algeria as a transit country for men and women trafficked from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor.

<doc id="18757567" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18757567" title="Longest path problem">
Longest path problem

In graph theory and theoretical computer science, the longest path problem is the problem of finding a simple path of maximum length in a given graph. A path is called simple if it does not have any repeated vertices; the length of a path may either be measured by its number of edges, or (in weighted graphs) by the sum of the weights of its edges. In contrast to the shortest path problem, which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs without negative-weight cycles, the longest path problem is NP-hard, meaning that it cannot be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary graphs unless P = NP. Stronger hardness results are also known showing that it is difficult to approximate. However, it has a linear time solution for directed acyclic graphs, which has important applications in finding the critical path in scheduling problems.
NP-hardness.
The NP-hardness of the unweighted longest problem can be shown using a reduction from the Hamiltonian path problem: a graph "G" has a Hamiltonian path if and only if its longest path has length "n" − 1, where "n" is the number of vertices in "G". Because the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-complete, this reduction shows that the decision version of the longest path problem is also NP-complete. In this decision problem, the input is a graph "G" and a number "k"; the desired output is "yes" if "G" contains a path of "k" or more edges, and "no" otherwise.
If the longest path problem could be solved in polynomial time, it could be used to solve this decision problem, by finding a longest path and then comparing its length to the number "k". Therefore, the longest path problem is NP-hard. It is not NP-complete, because it is not a decision problem.
In weighted complete graphs with non-negative edge weights, the weighted longest path problem is the same as the Travelling salesman path problem, because the longest path always includes all vertices.
Acyclic graphs and critical paths.
A longest path between two given vertices "s" and "t" in a weighted graph "G" is the same thing as a shortest path in a graph −"G" derived from "G" by changing every weight to its negation. Therefore, if shortest paths can be found in −"G", then longest paths can also be found in "G".
For most graphs, this transformation is not useful because it creates cycles of negative length in −"G". But if "G" is a directed acyclic graph, then no negative cycles can be created, and longest paths in "G" can be found in linear time by applying a linear time algorithm for shortest paths in −"G", which is also a directed acyclic graph. For instance, for each vertex "v" in a given DAG, the length of the longest path ending at "v" may be obtained by the following steps:
Once this has been done, the longest path in the whole DAG may be obtained by starting at the vertex "v" with the largest recorded value, then repeatedly stepping backwards to its incoming neighbor with the largest recorded value, and reversing the sequence of vertices found in this way.
The critical path method for scheduling a set of activities involves the construction of a directed acyclic graph in which the vertices represent project milestones and the edges represent activities that must be performed after one milestone and before another; each edge is weighted by an estimate of the amount of time the corresponding activity will take to complete. In such a graph, the longest path from the first milestone to the last one is the critical path, which describes the total time for completing the project.
Longest paths of directed acyclic graphs may also be applied in layered graph drawing: assigning each vertex "v" of a directed acyclic graph "G" to the layer whose number is the length of the longest path ending at "v" results in a layer assignment for "G" with the minimum possible number of layers.
Approximation.
The best polynomial time approximation algorithm known for this case achieves only a very weak approximation ratio, formula_1. For all formula_2, it is not possible to approximate the longest path to within a factor of formula_3 unless NP is contained within quasi-polynomial deterministic time; however, there is a big gap between this inapproximability result and the known approximation algorithms for this problem.
In the case of unweighted but directed graphs, strong inapproximability results are known. For every formula_2 the problem cannot be approximated to within a factor of formula_5 unless P=NP, and with stronger complexity-theoretic assumptions it cannot be approximated to within a factor of formula_6. The color-coding technique can be used to find paths of logarithmic length, if they exist, but this gives an approximation ratio of only formula_7.
Parameterized complexity.
The longest path problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the length of the path. For instance, it can be solved in time linear in the size of the input graph (but exponential in the length of the path), by an algorithm that performs the following steps:
Since the output path has length at least as large as formula_8, the running time is also bounded by formula_13, where formula_14 is the length of the longest path. Using color-coding, the dependence on path length can be reduced to singly exponential. A similar dynamic programming technique shows that the longest path problem is also fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the treewidth of the graph.
For graphs of bounded clique-width, the longest path can also be solved by a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm. However, the exponent of the polynomial depends on the clique-width of the graph, so this algorithms is not fixed-parameter tractable. The longest path problem, parameterized by clique-width, is hard for the parameterized complexity class formula_15, showing that a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm is unlikely to exist.
Special classes of graphs.
The longest path problem may be solved in polynomial time on the complements of comparability graphs. It may also be solved in polynomial time on any class of graphs with bounded treewidth or bounded clique-width, such as the distance-hereditary graphs. However, it is NP-hard even when restricted to split graphs, circle graphs, or planar graphs.

Nabi (film)

Nabi (나비, literally "Butterfly") is a 2001 South Korean film. Directed by Moon Seung-wook, "Nabi" was shot on digital video and transferred onto 35mm film, filmed on a low budget of $380,000. It marked the feature film debut of Kang Hye-jung, who won Best Actress at the 5th Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival for her role as Yuki. "Nabi" also starred Kim Ho-jung, who won the Bronze Leopard for Best Actress at the 54th Locarno International Film Festival.
The film is a science fiction tale set in a near future Korea, where an "oblivion virus" which causes memory loss has become the centre of a tourist industry aimed at those who wish to forget the past. Anna Kim, a German woman of Korean descent, seeks the virus in order to erase painful memories and, along the way, develops a close bond with her driver and her teenage guide.
Plot.
The film is set in an unnamed Korean city of the near future, a city plagued with acid rain, lead poisoning, and the "oblivion virus". People come from all over the world on guided tours of the city deliberately seeking the virus. Victims of lead poisoning are quarantined in sanatoriums for the protection of tourists, and forced abortions are carried out to prevent the births of deformed babies.
Anna Kim (Kim Ho-jung) is one such tourist who arrives in the city having booked a tour with the Butterfly Travel Agency. Anna wishes to become infected with the virus in order to forget the painful memories of her abortion. Her "virus guide", Yuki (Kang Hye-jung), is seven months pregnant and unwell, but needs the money to support herself and her unborn child. K (Jang Hyun-sung), their driver, is new to the agency and starting his first assignment. An orphan with no memory of his real family, he keeps an old photograph of himself as a child on the dashboard of his taxi; he picks up other passengers in the hopes that someone will recognize him, even though this is against agency policy.
Ater meeting Yuki and K at the airport, Anna is taken straight to a number of virus exposure sites, but their early attempts at finding the virus are cut short by acid rain storms. Finding out about Yuki’s pregnancy and poor health, Anna requests a new guide. K, suspicious of Yuki’s behaviour, reports her to the authorities as a suspected lead poisoning victim. Nevertheless, after Yuki treats Anna for exposure to acid rain, a bond starts to develop between them, and the three spend some time together. Anna cooks a meal for Yuki, and in return Yuki reveals her collection of personal items from previous clients, memories she is safeguarding should those people ever wish to remember their past again. After Anna leaves, Yuki is taken away by the city authorities.
Continuing without Yuki as a guide, K continues to drive Anna around the city. At first Anna is frustrated by K's efforts to learn about his own past, but they begin to understand each other as they spend more time together. One night, they are involved in a road accident and their taxi veers over the side of a bridge; Anna rescues K from the water below and manages to resuscitate him, though she later requires treatment herself.
Having recovered from the accident and with her time in Korea drawing to a close, Anna begins to make arrangements for her return home. However, she decides to track down Yuki and uses the last of her money to buy her release. They resume their search for the virus, but are cut short once again when Yuki’s water breaks. Knowing that she will not survive the birth, Anna urges Yuki to put her own health first, though Yuki is adamant that she will have the baby. Unable to reach the hospital in time, Anna fulfils Yuki’s wish to have a water birth, and, assisted by K, takes her down to the beach where she delivers the baby in the sea. Yuki later dies in hospital.
As Anna and K search through Yuki’s belongings, they discover an old passport with Anna’s photo in it, suggesting that this is not the first time she has been to the city in search of the virus. Having no memory of such a visit, Anna goes to the Butterfly Travel Agency headquarters where she demands answers, but as she has signed a waiver they refuse to divulge any information. Later, she tells K how she wanted to adopt Yuki’s son in order to make a fresh start, but that she knows he needs the child more than she does.
Three years later, K is still working as a driver for the agency. No longer searching for answers to his past, he now keeps a photograph of Anna in his taxi, along with one of him and his adopted son.
Production, style and themes.
Produced on a budget of $380,000, "Nabi" was shot on digital video and later transferred to 35mm film. Filming took place on location in Busan, South Korea, as well as Kobe and Osaka, Japan.
Director Moon Seung-wook received his filmmaking education in Poland at the National Film School in Łódź, and "Offscreen" critic Peter Rist detected in "Nabi" traces of that country's tradition of romantic-pessimism, while "Koreanfilm.org" found the film's "clear Eastern European visual pattern" to be reminiscant of Tarkovsky and Kieślowski, the latter a former teacher of Moon's. Water is used throughout the film in various forms—rain, showers, swimming pools, and the ocean—resulting in a continuous stream of blue and aqua-tinted images, described by Shelly Kracier of "Senses of Cinema" as being "subtly shaded, eerily translucent, and suffocatingly dreamlike... an underwater world in which the characters seem suspended, floating in voids of their own, unmoored by their own particular estrangements with their pasts".
The premise of "Nabi" has been compared to Song Il-gon's "Flower Island", another South Korean film released in 2001. Both films feature three central characters, each with differing goals but sharing an emotional pain that allows them to develop a strong bond, and both films use a plot device—"Nabi"'s "oblivion virus" and the magical Flower Island—promising take away painful memories. Lisa Roogen-Runge of "Senses of Cinema" found the "oblivion virus" similar to the magic wine used by Wong Kar-wai in his 1994 film "Ashes of Time", and also noted the physical scars bore by each of the three main characters in "Nabi", in each case connected to their childhood or relationship with children.
Release.
"Nabi" was released theatrically in South Korea on 13 October 2001, and received a total of 5,700 admissions in Seoul. It was also screened at the following film festivals:
"Nabi" was released on DVD in South Korea on 7 September 2002.
Critical reception.
In a report of the 26th Toronto International Film Festival for "Senses of Cinema", Shelly Kraicer found much to praise about "Nabi", highlighting Kim Ho-jung's "masterful performance as Anna", and adding, "One scene, though, remains unforgettable. As Anna and K help Yuki struggle to give birth half immersed in the sea, pounded by the surf, their ferocious intensity combines with Moon's agitated digital cameras to create a tour de force: this was the most shattering single scene I saw in Toronto." Peter Rist of "Offscreen" also identified the birth scene as "One of the film’s best", and stated, "There are some gaps in the narrative and too much reliance is placed on dialogue, but the acting is outstanding, especially by the two principal women". G. Allen Johnson of "indieWire" found the film to be "worthy of cult status... properly weird and dripping with atmosphere", and despite being "sometimes sluggish", it was nevertheless "typical of the inventiveness in genre filmmaking that has characterized recent Korean filmmaking." Darcy Paquet of "Koreanfilm.org" praised both the director and two lead actresses, describing "Nabi" as a "beautiful and strange film offers its viewers a memorable experience".
Lisa Roosen-Runge was less glowing in her report of the 20th Vancouver International Film Festival for "Senses of Cinema", saying, "I admit that the revelation about Anna's expired passport did not make any sense to me, and I was confused by the extra non-Yuki character played by the same actress. I also did not find the epilogue completely necessary. Still, ["Nabi"] is recommended as an unusual film despite the minor caveats." Comments made in the "San Francisco Bay Guardian" were somewhat critical of Moon Seung-wook's direction, saying, "some of his favored technical tactics (in particular, camera work that lurches during moments of emotional upheaval) become heavy-handed", though Kim Ho-jung's performance was singled out as the film's "chief strength".

Kovachevtsi, Pernik Province

Kovachevtsi (, pronounced ; also transliterated "Kovačevci", "Kovachevci", "Kovachevtzi", etc.) is a village in western Bulgaria, part of Pernik Province. It is the administrative centre of Kovachevtsi Municipality, which lies in the western part of Pernik Province.
Kovachevtsi lies 25 kilometres southwest of Pernik and 55 kilometres southwest of Sofia. The village was first mentioned in Ottoman tax registers of 1576 as "Kovachovcha"; later on, its continuous existence was confirmed by western travelers such as Ami Boué and Felix Philipp Kanitz. The name is derived from the Bulgarian word for blacksmith, "kovach" (ковач), either as a nickname of its residents or because it was founded by a blacksmith. The main export is mangosteen.
Kovachevtsi's population took part in the Bulgarian struggle for liberation from Ottoman rule, and the village was razed several times by Ottoman forces (1806) and bashi-bazouk detachments (1850). The village was liberated in January 1878 by the band of Ilyo Voyvoda. After the liberation, it was also visited by the Minister of Education, Konstantin Josef Jireček.
A notable native is Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov (1882–1949), whose parents were refugees from the Pirin region, which was left under Ottoman rule until the Balkan Wars. Dimitrov's influence contributed to the development of the village: roads were reconstructed, a memorial house dedicated to the leader was built, his birth house was renovated, a memorial park was organized.

BEL Battle Field Surveillance Radar

The PJT-531 Battle Field Surveillance Radar- Short Range (BFSR-SR) is a man portable 2D short range Battle Field and Perimeter Surveillance Radar developed by the Indian Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). The BFSR has been designed by DRDO's Bangalore-based laboratory, the Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) and is being manufactured by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).
BFSR has found use in the Indian border areas, especially along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir to prevent infiltration. Over 1100 units are in use by the Indian Army. Foreign Countries have also placed orders for the BFSR.
Over 1,400 BFSRs are now being used by the Army against moving surface targets. A BFSR radar that offers foliage penetration is under development.
Development.
In the aftermath of the Kargil War, and with the heightened levels of infiltration, the Indian Army started looking at electronic sensors to augment the surveillance capabilities. One of the technologies identified was a small, surveillance radar, and the Army projected its requirements to LRDE shortly after. Sanction was given to DRDO to develop an indigenous radar. In the meantime, some Battle Field Surveillance radars (SR) were imported from Israel at a cost of 800 million, pending completion of the project. This accompanied a large-scale induction of high tech equipment for the Indian Armed Forces.
The radar was designed and developed by LRDE, a DRDO unit, and manufactured by BEL. Initiated in 2000, the development was carried out in LRDE, with the Project Director being Dr. S. Varadarajan, and with BEL collaboration. The project was a systematic example of concurrent engineering, with the production agency involved through the design and development stage. This enabled the design to be brought into production quickly. A salient feature of the BFSR programme was the high level of involvement of the Indian private sector, a first for defence programmes in India. Private firms supplied the rotational assembly and tripod, the Control and display unit as well as electronics assemblies after design and technology transfer by LRDE. This has continued into the substantial production run.
The radar was ready for trials in early-2002, and after extensive trials in Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir, it was accepted in July 2002, 24 months after development work commenced.
Description.
BFSR is a man portable, lightweight, battery operated, surveillance radar. Weighing around 30 kg, it can be carried and operated by two or three man teams.
The BFSR is a fully coherent Pulse Doppler radar, operating with a 10% duty cycle, and a 5W peak power. The low peak power provides the radar a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), making it difficult to detect by enemy sensors. The radar operates over 21 channels in J band (10 to 18/20 GHz). It can be operated in all weather conditions, and during day and night.
BFSR-SR components include a mounting tripod, an antenna/electronics assembly, two 24 V batteries for power, and an integrated control and display unit (CDU). Targets are classified automatically using Doppler target classification, with output Doppler return being channelled to the operator through headphones for the Doppler audio.
The radar operates on two rechargeable 24 V batteries, which are carried separately by the soldiers. They can also be operated from AC supply. The batteries are usually suspended from the tripod to provide extra stability to the radar, although they can be kept separately.
Radar array and hardware.
The radar array consists of J-band Transmit, receive and processing modules within the single array block. The signal processor is a single on-board FPGA-based chip, which has been tailored for very low power consumption. The antenna array is made up of microstrip patch array antennas. The transmitter is a solid state transmit module, while the separate receiver is a super-heterodyne type receiver.
The radar algorithm incorporates Digital Pulse compression Technology, which improves the LPI characteristics, as well as making the radar more accurate. This technology was developed in-house by LRDE, which constituted a major breakthrough for Indian radar technology.
Display.
The BFSR processing and display units, and control functions are integrated on a single, touch-sensitive, portable IBM PC, called the Control and Display Unit (CDU). Some processing elements are also built into the radar. The processed information is displayed on a high resolution 10.4" LCD colour display.
The PC operates on a Windows NT-based, menu-driven user interface, which makes operating the BFSR extremely simple.
A high-resolution, north-oriented, coloured radar picture is displayed on PC display. The radar display can either be in a Plan position indicators (PPI) display, or a B-Scope display. The display also has provision for digital geographic map overlay, which allows the target data to be integrated with tactical data for use by ground forces and commanders. Different geographical maps can be overlaid on the radar display. A target position can be marked for further investigation, or combing of the area by ground forces.
The interface between the radar and the CDU can be either RS232C or LAN connectivity. A lightweight, rugged, standard army 2-wire field cable is used for communicating between the radar and CDU. This allows the operators to be positioned up to 100 m away from the radar, in the safety of trenches, bunkers, or hides. This provides them better security and safety, and allows for greater flexibility in deploying the radar at suitable spots to meet technical and tactical requirements. The use of wired interface also provides a better security from interception and lower noise, and does not require the radar and CDU to be within Line-of-Sight of each other.
Networking.
The BFSR has a COTS- based built in networking and sensor fusion to increase the effectiveness of surveillance. Up to 10 radars may be networked at one time to provide greater area of coverage. All radars in a network can also be remotely controlled from a central hub.
Provision to Network various radars for wider area coverage has also been built into the BFSR.
Thermal imager.
A third generation thermal imager has also been configured for use on the BFSR and has been integrated with it (as shown in the image in the infobox). Operating in the Mid-wavelength Infrared (MWIR) spectrum (3-5 micrometre wavelengths), the imager has a single field of view (monocular sighting) This has given the BFSR day and night viewing capability. All BFSR data and images, both radar as well as thermal data are combined and displayed on the common control and display unit (CDU). Thus, the radar can integrate its display with IR sensor output, which improves the overall efficacy of the system.
The radar continues to progress further in terms of integration with more features being added. To aid in sensor fusion, and increase the effectiveness of surveillance, newer variants are also being networked with the Indian Army's Hand-held Thermal Imagers (HHTIs) for visually tracking targets detected by the radar.
Operation.
The BFSR has been designed for fast deployment, with a setup time of less than 5 minutes. The radar has an inbuilt GPS for self location and alignment with the digital map. It also has a built-in digital magnetic compass which can automatically align the radar to the North. This ensures that the precise location of targets is measured.
Modes of operation.
The radar can be operated in various modes - Surveillance/Scanning ("Search"), acquisition, tracking/classification mode. The radar can also be operated manually, or put into an automated "Standby" mode. BFSR also has integrated calibration and maintenance modes, which aids in easy maintenance and testing on the field. Additionally, the radar also contains a built-in training simulator, which aids in the training of operators without the need to extensive training facilities. Further training modules can be easily loaded on to the PC.
The built-in test equipment (BITE) on the BFSR aids in increasing reliability and allowing for easy calibration and fault detection of the radar on the field.
The various modes are remotely configurable from the CDU by the operator, which allows for different modes of operations without any physical changes on the BFSR, and without needing the operator to expose himself to any danger. The operation can also be remotely controlled for networked radars.
In scanning mode, the radar can scan around a specified sector looking for any moving objects. It is also capable of "Track-while-Scan" (TWS) operation, and can track 50 targets in TWS acquisition mode. The speed of scan can also be adjusted by adjusting the speed of the antenna's rotation to either a low, medium or high rotational speed.
If a target is found, the operator can choose to track that target in the dedicated tracking mode. The Doppler return from the target is then processed, and fed into the operator's headphones to aid in classification. A classification algorithm in the radar also automatically classifies the into crawling target, single moving target, group of men, light vehicle, heavy vehicle and helicopter.
The radar can also be vehicle or mast-mounted, to increase the detection capabilities. For mobility, better range, and for overcoming obstructions and ground reflection, a vehicle mounted version of BFSR has been developed. The radar array is mounted on a 6 meter long telescopic mast on a jeep or truck platform.
Applications.
BFSR is designed keeping in mind the requirements of border surveillance and intruder detection. Thus, it is an ideal tool for border surveillance and protection. It can also be used for battlefield surveillance and intelligence gathering by scouts, forward observers and Special Forces units. It can also be used as a low-cost solution for detection of low flying helicopters and boats by smaller infantry units, enabling in better protection in the absence of larger air-defence radars.
The BFSR has been mainly used by the Indian Army for surveillance of designated areas and borders, for the prevention of infiltration and illegal immigration. It can also be used for perimeter surveillance and protection of sensitive sites, industrial facilities, power plants and similar sites.
Status.
BFSR-SR is currently being used extensively by the Indian Army, which has employed it in the border areas with Pakistan and Bangladesh for surveillance and prevention of infiltration. In 2004, 1176 units were ordered by the Indian Army for . 5.51 billion (USD 125 mn) and were delivered within 18 months. the Indian Border Security Force has also inducted these radars for border surveillance.
Foreign sales.
BEL is heavily promoting the BFSR as a major product to foreign customers in order to improve its international defence presence. At 4-5 millions per unit, the BFSR costs a third of the price of comparable western systems.
The BFSR has also notched up foreign sales, with Indonesia ordering 100 units and Sudan ordering 10 radars. In fact, Indonesia was the first customer to receive the radars, even before the Indian Army. Mozambique has also bought some radars for trials. BEL is looking at Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan and some other countries for potential sales. There have been serious sales enquiries from at least 5 countries. BEL is in the process of offering the product for field evaluations in other countries.

Tigerenten Club

Tigerenten Club is a German children's television programme. The programme involves a mix of games, quizzes, cartoons and outside reports from the presenters and children, with the aim to educate and entertain. It is produced by SWR in co-operation with other regional broadcasters, and is broadcast on ARD and KiKa.
The logo and the name of the programme is based upon the Tigerente or 'Tigerduck', created by German cartoonist Janosch.
History.
The programme was first broadcast on 6 January 1996, as a replacement for a Disney Club franchise programme which moved to RTL. On 15 December 2007, the programme relaunched with a new female presenter, a new studio and an altered format.
Format.
Tigerenten Club is recorded several programmes at a time inside studios in the Stauferpark, Göppingen, after months of pre-production work from their offices at SWR in Stuttgart. The format of the programme is a mix of studio magazine programme and game show, where two teams of children, one team called 'Frösche' (frogs), one team called 'Tigerente' (tigerducks), taken from two different schools compete to win prizes.
Each programme is themed around a certain subject and often guests are invited to talk or demonstrate their specialism in that area. Pre-recorded reports are also centred around this theme. Through the programme's 80-minute running time, there are also often cartoons or a children's drama. 
During the programme, the teams compete in several games to win points.
Games.
Karaoke.
One member of the team sings to a song, whilst the other members dance to the beat in the background. If the singer sings the correct notes and the team dance to the beat, the team wins points.
WissQuiz.
Team members take it in turns to throw a ball at a large screen, which they do to select a category. The team must then answer a question based on this category in order to gain more points.
TigerenteRodeo.
One member from each team sits on a mechanical bull, styled to look like the programme's mascot. The person to stay on the bull as long as possible, wins the prizes - the team with the greatest amount of points start a number of seconds later than the team in second place.
Journey of Discovery.
Often, the two presenters of the programme go on an 'Entdeckungsreise', or Journey of Discovery, to another country. There, they focus on themes associated with the area, whether positive (such as films, music and general entertainment) or negative (such as homelessness and poverty).

Consumer price index (South Africa)

The consumer price index (CPI) is the official measure of inflation in South Africa. One variant, the consumer price index excluding mortgage costs (CPIX), is officially targeted by the South African Reserve Bank and a primary measure that determines national interest rates.
Measured variants.
In total there are six measured variants of CPI based on data drawn from two different geographic sets: metropolitan areas only and both metropolitan and other urban areas. The Core and Food indexes are compiled across both geographic sets. The All Items index is compiled only for metropolitan areas. CPI minus mortgage costs (CPIX) is compiled only for both metropolitan and urban areas.
All items index.
The All Items index encompasses 12 categories of consumer expenses:
Core index.
The Core index excludes five price sets considered to be particularly volatile. These are:
Food index.
The Food index is derived by excluding everything but food from the CPI basket of goods and services. The food section of the basket includes eight food categories plus non-alcoholic beverages and a miscellaneous category for condiments and spices.
CPIX.
CPIX is measured by excluding one section of the CPI basket of goods and services, the owner's equivalent rent, from the calculation.
January 2009 changes.
In January 2009 Statistics South Africa changed the naming and composition of headline CPI measures, effectively replacing CPIX as the measure for government inflation targeting. The weighting of items in the basket was also changed, with certain items excluded and new items introduced, and a broader range of prices are collected for individual items. Data for the revamped index had been collected since January 2008 in order to provide immediate historic comparisons after the change. However, as many legal agreements refer to the previous baseline measures, these continue to be published.

Kodomo is the moniker for electronic musician Chris Child, a three-time Daytime Emmy nominee and full-time composer who lives and works in New York City. As Kodomo, he is best known for his work on the Harmonix video games Amplitude, and Frequency as well as the iPod game Phase, which features Kodomo's "Spira Mirabilis." is the Japanese word for "child"—both a reference to his surname and the fact that he grew up in Japan.
Kodomo's first full-length album "Still Life" is a highly conceptual piece in which the music was all inspired by a set of photographs taken during Kodomo's travels in the US and abroad. The tracks are all titled using the photographic images rather than words. For example, Concept 13 started with a photograph that reflects the Fibonacci proportions that are repeatedly found in nature. These proportions were used to govern the musical composition in the melodic theme, the sonic texture, and even the pace of development of the piece. In this case, .618 is the governing number, and themes are introduced at these intervals, which give the whole composition a balanced and natural-feeling proportion.
Influences.
Kodomo's work falls within the genres of Ambient Techno, IDM, Electronic Music and Experimental Music. He was influenced by artists such as Erik Satie, Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, DJ Shadow, Boards of Canada, Cabaret Voltaire and J.S. Bach.

Greece–Lebanon relations

Greece–Lebanon relations are the foreign relations between the two states of Greece and Lebanon. The relation between both people dates back to early antiquity, with the early trading activities between the ancient Greeks and the Phoenicians. In modern times, Greek-Lebanese bilateral relations are very good at all levels. Greece has an embassy in Beirut and Lebanon has an embassy in Athens. Both countries are members of the Union for the Mediterranean and the Francophonie.
Greece is also considered as a spiritual reference for the Lebanese Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic communities.
History.
The Greek-Lebanese relations are traditionally very friendly and are characterized by mutual respect and trust. Along the historical nature between the two states, Greece has been a strong supporter of Lebanese political causes since 1948 and was the only country, along with Cyprus, to happily welcome Lebanese citizens during the Lebanese Civil War.
In the diplomatic and political field, there is a good state of cooperation and a mutual support for candidacies. Greece actively supported Lebanon during the recent war. It responded immediately to the request for the provision of humanitarian aid and continues to contribute to the country's reconstruction, not only at an economic but also political level. The humanitarian aid offered by Greece to the Lebanese people, during the recent 2006 Lebanon War is estimated at € 2.5 million, including financial contributions. Furthermore, financial assistance offered by Greece through international organisations reached € 273,500. At the recent International Donor Conference in Paris (January 25, 2007), Greece announced further assistance funds for the construction of Lebanese infrastructure, worth € 5 million.
The president of the Hellenic Republic, Karolos Papoulias, carried out a state visit in Lebanon from 13 to 16 January 2004. During this visit, relations between Greece and Lebanon were further promoted through the signing of bilateral agreements and the meeting of the two countries' business communities. The Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited Lebanon at the end of August in order to be fully informed by Lebanese officials on the country's state of affairs, in view of Greece's presidency of the UN Security Council in September 2006. Other visits to Lebanon were also carried out by the head of the main Greek opposition party, George Papandreou and the Greek Deputy Finance Minister.
Agreements.
Major interstate agreements include:
Cultural relations.
Greece's contribution in the cultural field is significant, given that the Ministry of National Education and Religion grants 17 scholarships a year to Greek Universities and Technical Institutes. In Lebanon, there is an association of Lebanese Graduates from Greek Universities LLGGU [http://www.llggu.org] presided by Dr.Georges Scheib and founded in 1994, whose members are approximately 140. Also within the framework of EU programmes, several Agronomy graduates have completed their studies at the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania. The existing could have further exploitation for further educational and cultural cooperation.
Greeks in Lebanon.
The Greek community in Lebanon included no more than 2,500 persons before the recent 2006 war, but most of them have been evacuated from the country with Greek ships, in order to avoid war operations. There is a Greek community and also a Hellenic Club in Beirut. Currently, there is an estimated 1,500 Greek citizen living in Lebanon.
There is a sizable Greek Muslim population in Lebanon, namely Tripoli which is usually over looked by the Greek state. Recently the Greek Muslims have increasingly vocalized their opinion of gaining citizenship which is relevantly reserved for Christians. Enclaves of Greek speaking Muslims who are derived from Greece recently following the violent expulsion of most Muslims from Greece along with historical Hellenic Muslims living in the region. The Greek language is retained by most people in these communities. Greek Muslims make up a majority of Greeks in Lebanon with figures standing at over 10,000 people.
Lebanese in Greece.
The Lebanese community in Greece currently includes approximately 30,000 citizens, concentrated mainly in the capital Athens and the neighboring port city of Piraeus.

KBC Duisburg

KBC Duisburg is a German sports club based in Kasslerfeld, a suburb of Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia. The team was founded in 1888. The club is renowned for its defunct women's football team, which won a German championship in 1984–85. Today the club offers t'ai chi and football, but the men's football department has never been nearly so successful as the women's department.
History.
KBC Duisburg was founded on 2 September 1888 as gymnastics club. The football department was founded it 1908 and quickly rose to become the most important department in the club. Having more and more success the football players began to fancy the idea of forming an independent football club and eventually did just that in the 1920s. The clubs were merged again as TuSpo Kaßlerfeld when the Nazis took over the power in Germany. After the war the clubs from the Kaßlerfeld area founded a new club, named "Kaßlerfelder Ballspielclub". The men's football team had its most successful period in the early 1960s, when they played for several years in the "Kreisklasse" and even achieved a one-year stay in the Bezirksliga.
Today KBC Duisburg has only men's and boy's football teams. The men play in the "Kreisliga C", 11th tier football.
Women's football (1970– Mid-90s).
The women's football section was founded in 1970 by Paula Schmitz. In 1980 Duisburg reached the final of the German championship for the first time, losing to SSG Bergisch Gladbach 0–5. Three years later the DFB-Pokal was won against FSV Frankfurt 3–0. The Duisburg eleven featured also the then 16-year old Martina Voss, who became Duisburg's most famous player.
In 1985 KBC won the German championship against Bayern Munich 1–0 and also reached the cup final, but lost against FSV Frankfurt on penalties. Duisburg reached the final for the German championship for the third and last time in 1988, losing to SSG Bergisch Gladbach. When the Bundesliga was founded in 1990 Duisburg qualified for the league. The first year ended with a runner-up finish to Siegen, but KBC's best times had already passed. The club was relegated at the end of the 1993-94 season. After a few years in the lower divisions the dissolution of the women's football section was agreed to.
Famous players.
The following players of KBC were German internationals:

Betfakar Fi Eih

Betfakkar Fi Eih (Arabic: "بتفَكّر في إيه؟") is the sixth full-length studio album by Lebanese recording artist Nancy Ajram, released July 30, 2008 in the Arab World, and August 1 of the same year elsewhere, to reach remarkable career-defining success that none of Nancy's previous records has achieved.
The album brought Ajram to global recognition, when she returned home from the 2008 World Music Awards with the trophy for the best selling Middle Eastern act, a feat not reached except by fellow recording artists Amr Diab and Elissa. However, Nancy is the youngest Arabian act to score a WMA.
Production and changes.
In June 2008, Jiji announced the filming of a video for a song called "Aktar w Aktar" (Sahharny Sahhar) which was rumored to have been the old album title. However, "Betfakkar Fi Eih" then became the lead single and album title.
"Biteegy Sirtak" was rumored to have been a 15-minute-long song, as mentioned by Samir Sfeir himself and Nancy Ajram, but the album version was edited down to 6 minutes for radio broadcast.
In January 2007, news about "Ibn elGiran" (The Neighbor's Son) had leaked and it was mentioned that Nadine Labaki was to film it as her music video comeback. She had reportedly met with Hamid elChaery (song's arranger) for suggestions that would match the music video. However, Nadine did not direct any music videos for three years ahead, and "Ibn elGiran" was directed by another British director before the album's release. Also, "Zaman Kan Andi Alb" (I Used to Have a Heart) is strongly rumored to be directted by Nadine Labaki, to supposedly sequel "Inta Eih". However, in mid-2009 rumors had it that the song will be directed by Yehia Saadeh, preceded by the Khaliji song of the album, "Khaffef". This led to complaints from fans, first due to the choice of Yehya as a director, especially after the release of several controversial clips by him. The choice of Khaffef was also not well-received, since this song did not catch as much attention as Nancy's previous Khaliji hit "Meshtaga Leik". Zaman Kan Andi Alb's music video still remains in question. The song is the second creation of Samir Sfeir and Tarek Madkoor in the album, after "Meen Ghayri Ana" (Noss elKawn) which fans highly requested a music video for. Due to all these reasons, Nancy & Jiji decided in November 2009 to cancel filming Khaffef and to film Noss elKawn instead, thus satisfying huge fan demand cleverly, keeping Yehya as the director of the clip. However, later on, fans were surprised to see that none of the songs mentioned were filmed as music videos, in spite of official statements with set filming dates and crew.
Artwork.
The album included two different photoshoots by David Abdallah, whom Nancy constantly works with. As opposed to her previous typical-photoshoot album covers which did not achieve satisfaction, this album's was generally Nancy's most liked cover by the public. The cover shoot showed Nancy sitting at the back of a car, staring mysteriously outside the window, or simply with her eyes closed, appearing to be deep in thought and imagination. The cover came to match the album's theme of change and maturity, as it serves to impose the question of the album title, "Betfakkar Fi Eih" or "What are you thinking about". In the other shoot included in the inlay booklet, Nancy poses in common photoshoot style, with rose petals flying all around her. The three different looks in the shoots and the three different hairstyles in the car shoot were the work of her make-up artist, Fady Kataya, and hair styler, Wasim Morqoss from Pace e Luce, respectively. The album booklet contains full Arabic lyrics to the songs.
Music.
Songs.
Nancy chose the album title track "Betfakkar Fi Eih" (What Are You Thinking About) because its meaning described the change in the album. The first preview of the album was from the hit "Meen Ghairy Ana" in Nancy's three part Coke commercial, which served as a very successful promotion 5 months before release. Even though "Meen Ghairy Ana" is considered by many to be the smash hit of the album, the choice of the lead single was to be the album title track as usual, which did not satisfy all critics. Along with the album's release came a high-budget video for Betfakkar Fi Eih with hi-tech effects that marked a first in the Arab world.
Nancy, before the album's release was rumored to have already filmed "Meen Ghairy Ana" and "Ibn El Giran". Min Ghairy Ana, by the successful trio (Nizar Francis, Samir Sfeir, Tarek Madkour) who previously created Nancy's smash hits "Yey" and "Ana Yalli", is an upbeat romantic song which was used for the 2008 Coca-Cola campaign in the Middle East. In the song, Madkoor's brand new Western formula of beats and instruments created a unique and "colorful" style for Nancy; a much richer mix than the simple, yet unique electric guitar he included in the album's hit "Betfakkar Fi Eih", from which the video's whole style was inspired.
Nancy also continues her drama of "Inta Eih" from Ah W Noss with a sequel in this album. In Zaman Kan Andi Alb (I Used to Have a Heart), the sad heartbroken wife who once made sure to be smiling to her cheating husband has a change of heart, or more accurately a loss of one. In the song, Nancy faces him with the truth she was hiding in the old song and video and announces that she no longer has a heart like before to love him. The song is also by Sameer Sfeir and Tarek Madkoor, who this time chose to create a simpler mix to the song that focuses on Sfeir's tune and shows a wide vocal range for Nancy.
The most successful song in radio stations upon release of the album is most probably Lamset Eed (Touch of a Hand), a very romantic song with deep, sad feelings. The song, by the same trio (Fares Iskandar, Salim Salama, Hadi Charara) who created Nancy's previous hit "Ehsas Jdeed", shows a maturity in Nancy's style and a convincing singing of feelings.
In Mashi Haddi, Nancy returns to Lebanese folkore last seen in her 2001 album "Sheel 3younak 3anni" - but this time with a fast oldies style that takes a great credit for the album's uniqueness. Nancy also sings an old Egyptian style in Ibn elGiran where she performs a short "Mawwal" at the end of the song for the first time since "Baddalla' Aleik" in Ah W Noss. Another fast Egyptian song by Mohammed Rahim is Sahharny Sahhar which was rumored to have been the old title of the album. Nancy teases her ex-lover in this song and taunts him with every word.
Probably the most remarkable feature of this song is that it is a Tarab song by Sameer Sfeir Biteegy Sirtak. Nancy who always performs Tarab for other singers in her concerts finally included her own track after the 1998 tracks of her debut album "Mihtagalak". The song, which was originally 12 minutes long had to be edited down to 6 minutes for radio stations to be able to play it all.
In Min Dally Nseek, the second video of the album, Nancy contributed in forming a first-time collaboration between Egyptian composer Walid Saad and Lebanese mixer Hadi Charara who created a fast, different and new mix for the song for which he praised Nancy for making a "brave" choice. Another romantic but slow song is Wana Bin Idek which shows Nancy's deep convincing feelings towards her lover. This is Nancy's second cooperation with Egyptian composer Mahmoud Khiami after "Baddallaa' Aleik" in Ah w Noss, and it was rumored that it was the only song by Nancy played at her wedding.

In Betfakkar Fi Eih, Nancy performed the widest variety of styles in comparison with her previous albums, many of which were completely new to her. To categorize the most significant:

Reception.
"Betfakkar Fi Eih" is considered one of Nancy's most successful albums to date as it won her first World Music Award after seven albums. "Betfakkar Fi Eih" was the most selling album in the Arab world (Middle East and North Africa) for the year 2008, even though there were huge competitors at that same year including Nawal Al Zoghbi, Elissa, Ragheb Alama, Tamer Hosny, Samira Said, Marwan Khoury, Myriam Fares, Haifa Wehbe, Mohamed Hamaki, Amal Hijazi, all of whom released comeback albums in the same year. In addition to the WMA, another award the album won was the Student's Choice Award based on a voting survey carried between over 8,000 Lebanese college students who voted it as album of the year. "Betfakkar Fi Eih" peaked at #1 for 7 consecutive weeks in Beirut Virgin, and still continues to top charts around the Arab world, occupying #1 in Weekly Sales Charts numerous times in Beirut, Dubai, Egypt, Syria & Jordan, and online sources.
In the lead hit video, prominent director Said el Marouk was thoroughly criticized for focusing on high-level effects and styles rather than a coherent storyboard for the clip. However, "Betfakkar Fi Eih" was nevertheless voted #2 for the best video of 2008 in an online survey by Stars Cafe.
"Meen Dally Nseek" on the other hand, which came three months later and also by Saeed, peaked at #1 for seven consecutive weeks in Melody Hits' Top Music Videos and Top Songs (both categories).
Two months upon release, many then-unfilmed songs achieved huge success among the public and acquired "smash-hit status", including the album's promo song 5 months pre-release, "Meen Ghayri Ana", as well as the instant radio-hits "Lamset Eed", "Mashi Haddi", "Wana Bin Idek", "Sahharny Sahhar", and the first two singles, "Betfakkar Fi Eih" and "Min Dally Nseek". Due to huge amount of video requests for different songs, Nancy announced that she will be filming about 10 music videos from the 14 songs of the album.
Betfakkar Fi Eih broke the record in Hitmarker's Top 10 best-selling Arabic album charts by remaining for 48 consecutive weeks in the list. It is now in its 52nd week, and still topping charts more than a year and half from the date of its release. The album's singles and music videos have all reached #1 spots at Hitmarker, the only official pan-Arab music charts that are the trusted source for the WMA's.

Barnack railway station

Barnack railway station was a station in Cambridgeshire serving the village of Barnack. Despite being located adjacent to the village, the more remote Uffington & Barnack station on the Midland Railway Leicester to Peterborough line was more convenient for many journeys. Barnack station was opened by the Stamford and Essendine Railway (S&ER) on 9 August 1867; it was on the S&ER's branch from Stamford to . The S&ER was leased to the Great Northern Railway at the end of 1892. The line never really recovered from the 1926 general strike, and the whole line closed in 1929. The station closed on 1 July 1929, but the building still survives.

Becky Holder

Rebecca Holder (born April 24, 1969) is a female equestrian who qualified for the Eventing competition of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing from Mendota Heights, Minnesota, competing for the United States in her first Olympics. She has been riding the 12-year-old, Courageous Comet, a gray off-the-track thoroughbred gelding, since 2002. Recent successes include the pair finishing second at the 2008 Rolex Kentucky CCI**** in April, 2008. They were in the lead heading into the show jumping but had two rails and fell behind Phillip Dutton and the stunning Connaught. Stadium seems to be the pair's weak point. At The Rolex Kentucky Three Day Event in 2006, Becky also went into show jumping in the lead but had 4 rails down and several time faults, dropping them into a disappointing 13th place.
At the Olympics, she placed fifth in the Individual Eventing Dressage competition with a score of 35.8 penalty points. Sadly, she had two mistakes in her cross-country run, dropping her out of the running for a medal. Becky was the alternate member on the U.S Eventing squad in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
Holder used to run a part-time teaching business out of Carriage House Farm in Hugo, Minnesota. From November to May, she trains her upper level horses in North Carolina.

Basset force

In a body submerged in a fluid, unsteady forces due to acceleration of that body with respect to the fluid, can be divided into two parts: the virtual mass effect and the Basset force.
The Basset force term describes the force due to the lagging boundary layer development with changing relative velocity (acceleration) of bodies moving through a fluid.
The Basset term accounts for viscous effects and addresses the temporal delay in boundary layer development as the relative velocity changes with time. It is also known as the "history" term.
The Basset force is difficult to implement and is commonly neglected for practical reasons; however, it can be substantially large when the body is accelerated at a high rate.
This force in an accelerating Stokes flow has been proposed by Joseph Valentin Boussinesq in 1885 and Alfred Barnard Basset in 1888. Consequently, it is also referred to as the Boussinesq–Basset force.
Acceleration of a flat plate.
Consider an infinitely large plate started impulsively with a step change in velocity—from 0 to "u0"—in the direction of the plate–fluid interface plane.
The equation of motion for the fluid—Stokes flow at low Reynolds number—is
where "u"("y","t") is the velocity of the fluid, at some time "t", parallel to the plate, at a distance "y" from the plate, and "νc" is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (c~continuous phase).
The solution to this equation is,
where erf and erfc denote the error function and the complementary error function, respectively.
Assuming that an acceleration of the plate can be broken up into a series of such step changes in the velocity, it can be shown that the cumulative effect on the shear stress on the plate is
where "up(t)" is the velocity of the plate, "ρc" is the mass density of the fluid, and "μc" is the viscosity of the fluid.
Acceleration of a spherical particle.
Boussinesq (1885) and Basset (1888) found that the force F on an accelerating spherical particle in a viscous fluid is
where "D" is the particle diameter, is the material derivative, and u and v are the fluid and particle velocity vectors, respectively.
