Global Vaccines

Global Vaccines, Inc is a mission-driven non-profit company applying state-of-the-art science and innovative business strategies to design and develop affordable vaccines for people in poor countries. 
Origins.
In 2006, Robert E. Johnston, Ph.D., opened the doors of Global Vaccines, Inc (GVI), a not-for-profit company, spinning out from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in order to develop new vaccines free from the limitations of high profit-margin requirements. The company develops platform vaccine technologies that can be applied to a broad spectrum of disease targets selected on the basis of global public health needs rather than market potential. It is located in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina.
Challenges.
Polio, malaria, rotavirus, HIV – these diseases hit the poorest people on earth the hardest, with millions of new infections each year. On top of the sheer human suffering involved, the economic impact of this disease burden on affected countries is severe.
But poor countries simply can’t afford the high cost of creating new vaccines to prevent these diseases, and companies from developed countries won’t invest in vaccines that have little market value.
The Global Vaccines Solution.
Global Vaccines, Inc develops and acquires new vaccine technologies that can be used to fight diseases of both the developed and developing worlds.
They sublicense these new technologies to commercial companies for use in more profitable markets, giving them the financial ability to continue developing these technologies to help the globe’s poorest.
It's a win-win formula – commercial companies acquire more mature technologies for a less risky investment, and the developing world gets the vaccines it needs.
In several preclinical trials, Global Vaccines' novel technologies have already shown remarkable promise across a range of disease targets. 
Disease Targets.
Currently, Global Vaccines focusing on developing vaccine technologies for use against a range of diseases. Follow the links below to learn more about current disease targets and the technologies Global Vaccines has been developing to address these disease pathogens:

The TV IV

The TV IV is a MediaWiki-powered website that was launched in July 2005 as a response to TV Tome becoming TV.com. It is in the top thirty wikis on the web in both size and views. Because English-speaking users generate the website, the content is primarily on English-language television programs, but all content is welcome.
Features.
The TV IV has articles on all aspects of television with the major emphasis on programs. The site has no notability requirements and allows articles to be created for any program, episode, character, or aspect of a program, making it an often listed alternative to Wikipedia for information that doesn't fit Wikipedia's requirements. As of April 2013, it has over 5,800 program articles.
Another major focus is American-program scheduling and DVD releases. The TV IV's includes a listing of all new programs airing in the USA over the next two days and all TV DVDs being released on the following Tuesday as well as links to archives of both these data sets going back through 2006. In addition to the front page information the site includes current programming grids for both broadcast and cable networks and highly detailed future schedule grids for the broadcast networks. It also has historic primetime schedule grids going back to the beginnings of network television.
Due to its semi-narrow focus and not needing to adhere to a rigid database structure The TV IV is able to easily accommodate more trivial pages that couldn't easily be placed (or are unwelcome) on many other reference sites. In fact some of the wiki's most are these non-traditional reference pages that work well in the wiki format such as music lists and timelines.
Reception.
The TV IV has been hailed as a good use of a wiki format due to the large but specific topic and the potentially large fan base to draw from. It has also been touted as a good alternative to other Flash-heavy TV reference sites such as tv.com.
IVy Awards.
Since 2006, the TV IV has been awarding The IVy Awards winners have included: Hugh Laurie, Kristen Bell, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Edie Falco, Jason Bateman, Patrick Stewart, Sarah Chalke, Summer Glau and Will Arnett.

ERikm

eRikm is a French improviser, composer and visual artist who has been active in art since 1992.
He is noted for his work with turntables.
Maintaining a constant fusion between thought, instinct and sensitivity, he pursues a simultaneity of practices and addresses the interplay between various compositional modes, relating to and using all languages.
From his early experience as a guitarist through to his later visual work, he is a maverick genre-bender who breaks down anyone's attempts to conveniently classify him.
Quickly recognised as a virtuoso turntablist and sound artist (1996), eRikm has made a longlife habit of crossing all territories and « world-systems » deemed "independent", "institutional".
At the same time (1997), he has developed an open and aspirational approach toward the technological media, both as a means of development for a new economic model and as an instrument for creation, production and diffusion.
He deals with sounds like living organisms, constantly in flux, always open to the risk of accident or delight/unisson. As he plays with all these contradictions in his improvisations, his performance reaches new heights of intensity, trading off both understanding and sensation, seriousness and farce, anticipation and instinct.
His work references both the intimate and political, both popular and high culture, but without demonstration. Rather he creates a short-circuit connection between points with his live generated (and degenerated) material – from noise to reference – presenting multiple ways to capture each moment of the present in clear focus.
He is most well-known for his improvisational collaborations. Notable collaborators include: Luc Ferrari, Christian Marclay, Dieb13, Otomo Yoshihide, Mathilde Monnier, Bernard Stiegler, and FM Einheit.
Since 1997, on his own or with collaborators, eRikm has toured (with 5-7 on-tour projects to date), or created by request specific pieces, both transversal or for fixed spaces (record labels, radio, festivals, art centres…)
In the meanwhile, each time building on what has emerged before, the most personal fragments from his work (notably from his early artworks in photography, drawings, visual installations and video) continue to substantiate a singular kaleidoscopic vision.
Ultimately, eRikm's research resonates through all of his work, bordering scientific discovery and a poetic curiosity of the world.

John, Count of Chalon

John (1190 – September 30, 1267), called the Old ("l'Antique"), was a French nobleman, the Count of Auxonne and Chalon-sur-Saône in his own right and regent of the County of Burgundy in right of his son, Hugh III. 
He was the son of Stephen III of Auxonne and Beatrice, Countess of Chalon.
On June 5, 1237, he exchanged his inherited patrimony of Auxonne and Chalon with Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy for the following territories: Salins (which was at the time the second city of the County of Burgundy), Belvoir, Vuillafans, Ornans, Montfaucon, Arlay, the castle of Clées in Vaud, Chaussin, and Orgelet. He thus became one of the most powerful nobles in the county. 
Although he gave charters to the towns in his territory, he also welcomed the Dominican friars as inquisitors.
The possession of Salins, with its salt production, gave John the fortune necessary to extend his territories. To protect the trade routes, he built the following fortresses: Le Pin, Montmahoux, Saint-Anne, Arguel, and Nozeroy, where he normally resided.
To avoid the customs imposed by the Count of Pontarlier, he bought the forests in the region around Pontarlier and Jougne, which he logged, creating new roads. He founded the towns of Châtelblanc, Chaux-Neuve, and Rochejean, the last of which contains his name.
Family.
He had three wives and 16 children.
He married Mahaud (or Mahaut) of Burgundy, the daughter of Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy and Beatrice of Albon. She died March 26, 1242. They had the following children:
He remarried to Isabeau (or Isabel) of Courtenay, the daughter of Robert I of Courtenay. They had the following children:
Upon Isabeau's death September 22, 1257, he remarried to Laurette de Commercy, the daughter of Simon II, Seigneur de Commercy, and Matilda, Countess of Saarbrücken. They had the following children:

Side letter (collective bargaining)

A side letter or side agreement is a collective bargaining agreement that is not part of the underlying or primary collective bargaining agreement (CBA), and which the parties to the contract utilize to reach agreement on issues the CBA does not cover, to clarify issues in the CBA, or to modify the CBA (permanently or temporarily). One may distinguish side letters from "side settlements" or "settlement agreements", which settle a dispute arising from the underlying CBA. In rare cases, bargaining parties may use a side letter to adjust the focus of the contract if the parties are not yet ready or willing to adapt the contract formally.
Under the law of contracts, a side letter has the same force as the underlying contract. However, the courts may invalidate side letters in conflict with the main collective bargaining agreement. The terms of the CBA govern interpretation of side letters. In the U.S., several courts of appeals have held that in disputes where side letters do not contain conflict resolution procedures, the parties must use the underlying collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution mechanism (in these cases, arbitration) to resolve the dispute.
The range of issues side letters covers is wide. In some cases, side letters have driven national labor law policy. For example, in the United States, a side letter guaranteeing employer neutrality during union elections in newly acquired plants, subsidiaries or divisions led to a federal lawsuit over the legality of the agreement in 2002 and a major decision by the National Labor Relations Board revising federal labor policy in 2007.
In Australia, side letters are becoming increasingly common due to the changes in federal labor law the WorkChoices Act created. WorkChoices limits the collective bargaining agreements that parties can register for eligibility for workplace tribunals enforcement, and also requires CBAs be strictly limited to work-related issues. The inclusion of even minor non-workplace-related clauses (such as dues check-off) can render a CBA unenforceable. In response, many unions and employers are using side letters to reach agreement on non-workplace-related matters, and not registering these side-letters with the federal government—relying on common law to enforce the side letters.

Mi'ilya

Mi'ilya (, ) is an Arab local council in the western Galilee in the Northern District of Israel. Its name during the Kingdom of Jerusalem era in Galilee was Castellum Regis. All of its inhabitants are Christians. Mi'ilya is located northwest of the city of Ma'alot-Tarshiha, being immediately adjacent to it.
History.
Early history.
Archaeological excavations in Mi'ilya gives indication of inhabitation from the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age, as well as Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods.
Middle Ages.
King's castle.
The King's castle in Mi'ilya dates back at least to 1160, when King Baldwin III of Jerusalem granted title to it to a certain John of Haifa and his heirs. In 1182, Baldwin IV granted it to his uncle, Jocelyn III. At this time it was called "The new castle in the mountains of Acre". By 1187, the castle fell to Saladin. Later, in the early 1200, ownership passed to the Teutonic Knights. However, the importance of the castle of Mi'ilya was by this time superseded by the Montfort Castle.
The Arab geographer, Al-Dimashqi, noted the "fine castle", and that close to it was a very pleasant valley, where musk-pears and large citrons were grown.
Ottoman period.
In 1596, Mi'ilya appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the "Nahiya" of Akka of the "Liwa" of Safad. It had a population of 15 Muslim households and 2 Christian households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives, and goats or beehives.
In 1881, Mi'ilya was described as being a large and well-built village of stone, containing 450 Christians, surrounded by olives and arable land.
Mandatory period.
At the time of the 1931 census of Palestine, Mi'ilya had 138 occupied houses and a population of 553 Christians, 25 Muslims and 1 Druse. By 1945, this had increased to 790 Christians and 110 Muslims.
State of Israel.
In the early part of 1948 the village suffered from food shortages and harassment from neighbouring Jewish areas. It was captured by the Israeli army during Operation Hiram at the end of October. After a short fight most of population fled into the countryside. The following day the local IDF commander allowed them to return to their homes. This was one of the few occasions when villagers were allowed back into their villages after they had left. In January 1949 some villagers from Mi'ilya were expelled to Jenin, they complained of being robbed by Israeli soldiers whilst being deported. The Ministry for Minority Affairs reported that a further 25 villagers were expelled in March being suspected of passing information to the enemy. The Arab population remained under Martial Law until 1966. Mi'ilya was recognized as a local council in 1957.
Economy.
Transportation.
Mi'ilya is located on the Highway 89 which connects Nahariya with Elifelet via Safed.

Gary Fahey

Gary Fahey is a former All-Ireland winning Gaelic footballer who captained Galway in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.
His reputation as an excellent full-back in the annals of Galway football is assured, with five Connacht Senior medals and two All-Ireland medals which is a terrific personal haul.
Fahey’s intercounty career began in 1992 when he joined the Galway panel after playing a crucial role for the Sigerson Cup winning UCG team. Seán Óg De Paor was captain that year and Niall Finnegan also played when the Galway college defeated a star-studded Queens University Belfast side in Pearse Stadium, Galway. He made his debut in the summer of ’92 when he came on as a substitute against Mayo in Castlebar. Galway were defeated on the day and remained in the football wilderness after defeats to Leitrim in 1993 and ’94. It wasn’t until 1995 that they finally managed to win the Connacht title under Bosco McDermott. They defeated Mayo in the glorious sunshine in Tuam Stadium: their first provincial title in 8 years. Galway narrowly lost to Tyrone GAA|Tyrone in the All-Ireland semi-final.
Mayo under the guidance of John Maughan defeated Galway in both the 1996 and 1997 Connacht campaigns where they also lost both subsequent All-Ireland finals. John O'Mahony, who had brought Connacht titles to both Mayo and Leitrim, was announced as the new Galway manager in September 1997 after Val Daly's sole year in charge. The Mayo native then presided over what was to be a glorious period in Galway football with Fahey a central cog in the team.
Galway football supporters will never forget 1998 when their county defeated Kildare in the All-Ireland final to end 32 years of anguish. Gary Fahey had a great game at full-back that day and his tussle with Kildare’s Karl O’Dwyer was a feature of the final. The journey to the Holy Grail and Sam Maguire had started with a pulsating contest against who else but Mayo in Castlebar in May 98. It was here that the seeds of success were sown for a Galway team that badly needed to overcome their arch rivals to silence the doubters. Their 1–13 to 2–06 was the catalyst for an amazing season for Galway, who followed up with victories over Leitrim, Roscommon in the Connacht final and Derry in the semi-final.
Fahey had soldiered on the panel for six year’s before that magnificent All-Ireland victory and in the next 4 year’s he would play in some of the biggest games in Galway’s history. In 1999, an unfortunate hamstring injury kept him out of the Connacht Final, an injury that many believe that cost Galway that day against Mayo in Tuam Stadium. He returned refreshed for the 2000 season where the Tribesmen re-claimed the Connacht title after defeating Leitrim before narrowly losing to Kerry in the All-Ireland Final after a replay. According to Fahey, ""The 2000 final was the one that got away because we had the chances at the end of the first game to take the title.""
Galway began the 2001 championship season very badly when Roscommon ambushed them in Tuam but through the new ’back-door’ system they embarked on a sensational run of victories over Wicklow, Cork, Armagh, Roscommon (again) and Derry before clashing with Meath in the All-Ireland final. The initial Roscommon defeat was gut wrenching but with Alan Keane coming in as goalkeeper and Tomas Mannion reverting to centre-back Galway were an invigorated outfit.
Galway trounced Meath in the final by nine points to make up for the previous year against Kerry and in the process Fahey collected his second Celtic Cross. He also had the great honour of lifting the Sam Maguire trophy as captain, joining the likes of Galway men Jack Mangan and Enda Colleran.
Galway managed to win the Connacht title again in both 2002 and 2003 but fell short when it came to All-Ireland glory. 
John O’Mahony departed in 2004 and Fahey retired from inter-county football shortly after.

Joseph Philbrick Webster

Joseph Philbrick Webster, also known as J.P. Webster (February 18, 1819 – January 18, 1875), was an American songwriter and composer most notable for his musical compositions during the Antebellum and American Civil War periods of United States history, and his post-war hymns.
Amongst his most notable works are the ballad "Lorena" (1857), often considered the most popular song of the American Civil War (on both sides), "I'll Twine 'Mid the Ringlets" (written in 1860 and later known as "Wildwood Flower") and "In the Sweet By and By" (1868), one of the best-known Christian hymns in American history.
Life and works.
J.P. Webster was born in Manchester, New Hampshire on February 22, 1819. From an early age he expressed an interest and talent in music, going on to study with distinguished composers such as Lowell Mason and George James Webb, including a three year course of study beginning in 1840 in Boston. Afterwards he travelled extensively throughout the Eastern United States as a concert singer, including notable stays in New York and Madison, Indiana, where he performed with the famous "Swedish Nightingale" Jenny Lind, as her pianist. After years of travel, Webster eventually settled in Racine, Wisconsin.
Sometime before 1859 Webster developed what was commonly called "Lake Michigan Throat", a severe form of bronchitis, forcing him to abandon his singing career and move himself, and by then a wife and children, farther south and away from the lake to Elkhorn, Wisconsin. No longer having the strength in his voice for singing, Webster turned his attention to composing music. This was a passion that would produce over 1,000 songs, including music for ballads, hymns, patriotic drama, and a cantata.
During the Civil War years Webster taught and composed a variety of songs related to the war. He also participated as a drill sergeant for the Elkhorn "Wide Awakes", whose role was to act as the local home guard. As the war began to close, Webster returned his focus to writing ballads and hymns. About this time he also opened what was considered a "respectable saloon", which attracted young literary men of the town with which he would have future musical collaborations. One of these young men was Sanford Fillmore Bennett, who would later write the lyrics for ""In the Sweet By and By"".
Webster remained in Elkhorn until his death on January 18, 1875, at the age of 56. He is buried at the Hazel Ridge Cemetery in Elkhorn, where his epitaph reads, ""Joseph P. Webster. In the Sweet By and By We Shall Meet"". His former residence is now the home of the Walworth County Historical Society, which acts as a museum to both Webster and thousands of Civil War era antiques and unique items.

Mistborn series

The Mistborn series is four high fantasy novels written by Brandon Sanderson and published by Tor Fantasy. The series consists of the original trilogy of ', ', and ' published between 2006 and 2008, as well as a stand-alone short novel titled ' released on 8 November 2011. The fourth book takes place about 300 years after the original trilogy.
Geography.
The series primarily takes place in a region called the Final Empire on a world called Scadrial. One thousand years before the story begins the king of the Final Empire, the Lord Ruler, gained access to a divine power at what is called the Well of Ascension. With this power he remade the world and everything in it into its state at the beginning of the first book. In the Final Empire a "Dominance" is a territory within the Lord Ruler's empire.
Central Dominance.
Luthadel is the capital of the Central Dominance and the entire Final Empire. Luthadel is the heart of the Lord Ruler's power, as well as the site of his palace, Kredik Shaw. Before the Lord Ruler remade the world, Luthadel was a mountainous region known as Terris. To hide the true location of Old Terris and the Well of Ascension, the Lord Ruler moved the mountains elsewhere and named that region "Terris" instead.
The Pits of Hathsin were in the Central Dominance, where atium was mined. When Kelsier destroyed the atium crystals, he freed the slaves and the Pits were abandoned. When the Lord Ruler was killed, atium mining was eliminated altogether. The Pits were named for the dozens of cracks in the ground, where men were forced to crawl down to find the small geodes with centers of atium beads.
Slaves were crushed to death by rockfall, or executed if at least one geode per week was not found. Possibly thousands of unknown or uncared for dead corpses remained underground, lost in deep crevices.
The cracks in the ground were marked by fences by the Terris people, when the Pits became their new home. The remaining infrastructure from the old mining camp had buildings, shelters, and most importantly, fresh water along with farm crops of resilient hardy plants adapted to ash that needed little water. Once settled, the Terris people improved the valley, building more structures, brushing ash from the plant foliage to provide grazing for the adapted short-legged sheep that roamed the hills, and returning to their heritage of herding, before the Lord Ruler's Ascension. The Terris people's lives became easier than most on Scadrial, living in pastoral villages that replaced the once brutal prison camps.
Terris Dominance.
Terris is the ancestral home of the Terris people. It is a mountainous region located north of the Northern Dominance. The Terris Dominance is the only Dominance to retain its original name. It was historically the home of the Well of Ascension.
After the Collapse of the Final Empire and the Lord Ruler's death, Ruin controlled the Steel Inquisitors to destroy the Terris homeland and all its inhabitants. Many of the murdered Terris were used in Hemalurgical killings to create more Inquisitors.
Tathingdwen was the former capital of the Terris Dominance, burned by the Inquisitors during their assault on the Terris Keepers.
Northern Dominance.
Urteau is a key crossroads city in the Northern Dominance. It was the traditional seat of House Venture although the family is based mainly in the capital. Later it came under the control of a Skaa dominated government led by a man calling himself 'the Citizen'. Urteau is also famous for its canals that mysteriously ran dry. It plays a key role in the third novel.
Western Dominance.
Fadrex City is an important cross roads city in the Western Dominance. Although all cities outside of Luthadel are forbidden from having walls, Fadrex City has a natural rock formation that makes it very defensible. Lord Cett made this city his base after the fall of the Lord Ruler for this very reason.
Other dominances.
Mostly rural farms and villages, it is the most chaotic and unsettled of the five Inner Dominances. In the southern part of the Eastern Dominance is The Conventical of Seran, a Ministry stronghold, where the Steel Inquisitors and High Obligators of the Lord Ruler's religion had retreated after the Collapse.
Small region, mostly coastlands.
It is a somewhat mountainous region located south of the Southern Islands.
It is a mountainous region located east of the Northern and Eastern Dominances.
People.
Nobles.
The nobility are the descendants of the early supporters of the Lord Ruler. The Lord Ruler gave them the gift of Allomancy because of their support, through a substance that exists only in the Well of Ascension. The Allomantic power has been passed down through the generations, but their Allomantic gifts have grown weaker over the years. At first there were few Mistings with only one ability, but now Mistings far outnumber Mistborn. Allomancy is the main reason the interbreeding of nobles and skaa was made illegal by the Lord Ruler. The Lord Ruler had more control over the Nobles, so he didn't want the skaa to have Allomancy.
Skaa.
Skaa are the descendants of the people who did not support the Lord Ruler when he first came to power. During the reign of the Lord Ruler they were oppressed slaves treated brutally, with the law stating they belong to the Lord Ruler but loaned to the nobility for work. There were multiple skaa rebellions over the centuries, but they never came close to succeeding. All skaa Allomancers have some noble blood.
When the Lord Ruler ascended to power, he altered all of humanity to be capable of dealing with ash and caused additional slight physiological differences between skaa and nobility. Initial changes made the nobility less fertile, taller, more intelligent, while the skaa were made to be shorter, hardier, and to easily procreate. After a thousand years of sociological and biological mixing, the differences had been almost completely erased. When the series first starts, the skaa are beaten, oppressed, hopeless, superstitious about the Mists and treated as subhuman, less than animals, and it is acceptable for a Noble to have sex with a skaa woman as long as she is immediately killed to prevent Allomantic powers from spreading.
Technology.
Before the Ascension of the Lord Ruler weapons technology had progressed to the invention of gunpowder. At the beginning of his reign the Lord Ruler deliberately suppressed knowledge of gunpowder and most other advances. This was done to prevent technology undermining his military strength and being used against him in rebellions. This left only archers as the only long-range military option, and it left skaa rebellions at a disadvantage because archers require considerable training. The only major advance since the Lord Ruler's reign started is the invention of canning food.
"" takes place approximate three centuries later and technology has advanced to an early 19th-century level.
Creatures.
Kandra.
Kandra are highly intelligent life forms without distinct shape, physically resembling Mistwraith in their natural form, however, they are shapeshifters. The prime function of the kandra are as spies, because of their notable ability to imitate any being. They can consume dead creatures, memorizing and replicating the physical traits perfectly. They are nonviolent and valued for their skill as impersonators. They adhere rigidly to their societal mandate called 'The Contract', which forbids any killing, and through which they offer their services to humans. To hire a kandra, you must pay him or her with atium, the most powerful Allomantic metal. There are other jobs for kandra to perform in their Homeland, such as the teaching and instruction of a child kandra, considered a prestigious job among kandra.
The First Generation of kandra were converted by the Lord Ruler, from pre-Ascension Terris Worldbringers, the sect of spiritual leaders and Feruchemists, resulting in the kandra calling him "Father". Worldbringers mainly used their Feruchemical abilities creating copperminds to store knowledge as religious philosophers and scholars. 
After the Worldbringers were wiped out by the Lord Ruler during his Ascension, the Order of the Keepers in the Final Empire were inspired by their memory, dedicated to preserving pre-ascension knowledge of religion and other studies.
The First Generation then created all subsequent generations through "Blessings", using the art of Hemalurgy, with a pair of hemalurgic metal spikes provided by the Lord Ruler each century, giving the number requested by the kandra. During the thousand plus years of the Lord Ruler's reign, there have been Eleven Generations, with a Twelfth Generation unlikely, 
as their Father is dead. Without the Lord Ruler, the kandra cannot create new Blessings, or new kandra. Sometimes referred to as "mistwraiths that have evolved". It is revealed in the third book "" that kandra 
were first created from the Terris people and do not die naturally, essentially immortal. The "Blessings" given to a mistwraith grant sentience with additional benefits, with each kandra receiving one of the four Blessings: Awareness, Potency, Presence or Stability.
Blessing of Awareness: A pair of tin spikes which grant a kandra increased senses, similar to Allomantically burning tin.
Blessing of Potency: A pair of iron spikes which give a kandra great strength similar to an Allomancer burning pewter, but not exactly the same, and it will not grant the limitless energy received by burning pewter.
Blessing of Presence: A pair of copper spikes which grant increased mental capability, includes the ability to focus despite physical discomfort or distraction, exceptionally sharp memory, resistance to madness, and the inability to lapse into unconsciousness due to shock. This Blessing also counters at least some of the mental weakness that is caused by Hemalurgy; kandra with these spikes are much less vulnerable to being controlled by Ruin than is the norm.
Blessing of Stability: Rarely used, the Blessing of Stability is a pair of zinc spikes that endows its receiver with emotional fortitude, rendering them much more resistant to control by emotional Allomancy.
The First Contract was originally a series of promises made by the kandra First Generation to the Lord Ruler, written in steel, and codified as the first kandra laws. The first thing a kandra learned upon awakening from his or her life as a mistwraith, the First Contract contains commands to revere earlier generations, simple legal rights granted to each kandra, provisions for creating new kandra, and a demand for ultimate dedication to the Lord Ruler. The kandra Origin Legends include the First Contract, the Waiting, the Protection of the Trust and the Resolution. Most kandra believe, or want to believe that the First Contract and the Origin Legends are ancient anachronistic words, philosophical and abstract, either frightened by the contents or the requirement of great sacrifices. The elders know that the First Contract is not simple ceremony or metaphor, but an explicit set of instructions and actions to take when the world begins breaking, when Ruin returns, the kandra were to join the Father and serve him. The possibility of the Father being dead was not included, leaving some of the kandra to decide if the Father is dead, they must serve Vin. However, the First Contract contained a provision which, if invoked, would require the mass suicide of the entire kandra people.
Due to their advanced age, the First Generation appear to be made of darker coloured flesh which tend to hang off them when they are wearing bones. When they are in their Homeland, all Generations prefer to use the form of a True Body, a set of false bones, human-shaped, crafted by a kandra artisan. Some True Body forms are quartz, with translucent skin, allowing the stone to sparkle faintly in the light, others are made of simple stone. The Second Generation number twenty, with bones constructed of the purest crystal, some with a deep red tint, impractical with fragile bones but for administrator roles in the Homeland, the weakness of the bones was an acceptable trade-off for their sparkling beauty. Kandra have spent ten centuries enslaved to humankind, serving the Contracts in an effort to keep themselves safe. Most of the kandra hate humans for their situation. Ironically, even when kandra wear True Bodies, the forms are human, two arms, two legs, faces, even while they curse humankind for keeping them enslaved. The Unbirthed are the mistwraiths, which form a body in random shapes, connecting bones in odd arrangements, making almost artistic designs from both human and animal bones.
Numbers of kandra in each Generation vary. Elder generations, Firsts, Seconds, Thirds were small in number, since many had been killed in the early days, when the humans had feared them. However, later generations were well populated, the Tenth Generation had over a hundred individuals in it.
The Kandra Homeland's most sacred room is the Trustwarren, with a platform where only the most blessed or cursed were allowed, surrounded by tiers of seating for the entire kandra population. There is a small hole cut into the steel disk of the Trustwarren platform floor. The Trust, which is the collective kandra secret Treasure, of all the atium collected by kandra from their inception, lies directly underneath. The death of the Lord Ruler/Father results in upheaval for all life. The kandra believe in Worldbringers that spoke of a time when the Resolution occurs. As the Destroyer of the Lord Ruler, some kandra believe The Trust belongs to Vin.
Kandra are of Preservation, chosen of the Father, and are forbidden to kill. Humans and koloss kill each other, but both are of Ruin. Although considered treasonous within kandra society, on rare occasions one can kill other kandra under orders from the Contract holder, but this results in either imprisonment or execution by kandra elders. Executions are performed by pouring acid on an imprisoned kandra or by means of starvation.
The Secret of the Kandra, forbidden to be revealed to any non-kandra and punishable by death, is that the Lord Ruler designed all life forms with secret control mechanisms only he knew of, with the kandra and the koloss having a hidden Allomantic trigger, in which they can be controlled when an Allomancer "pushes" on their emotions.
Kandra people state they are of Preservation, while the koloss and Inquisitors are of Ruin. Yet, kandra bore Hemalurgic spikes like the others. However, the spikes cause only minor transformation in new kandra, which are made from Mistwraiths, not humans, resulting in bodies almost identical to Mistwraiths, but with expanded Cognitive, Physical and Spiritual abilities. Although hemalurgical spikes dehumanize Humans, Koloss and Inquisitors, the spikes return humanity to the Mistwraiths, who were originally human Terris Feruchemists, now Kandra. Created by the Lord Ruler to be spies, most interpreted this as meaning that he planned to use them as spies in his new government, because of their ability to imitate other people. While they were used for this purpose, something much more complex and grand was in their existence. They were the Lord Ruler's double agents, planted with Hemalurgic spikes, making Ruin believe he controlled them. Ruin always searches for his body, the atium Treasure, the Kandra Contract payment, secretly stored in the Kandra Trust for a thousand years. Yet the kandra were taught, bound, to pull the spikes free when Ruin tried to seize them. In Ruin's moment of triumph, when he'd always assumed the kandra would be his on a whim, the vast majority of them immediately switched sides and left him unable to seize his prize. They were of Preservation all along.
Mistwraiths.
Mistwraiths are concentrated mistforms and mindless scavengers with the ability to add the bones of creatures they consume to their own forms. They are part of the reason why Skaa fear the mists. Named the Unbirthed by Kandra, the Mistwraiths can become Kandra.
The murdered Terris Feruchemist people are the Mistwraiths. After the Lord Ruler's Ascension, he killed his ancestral people, the Terris Feruchemists, to eliminate threats to his power by future challengers with Terris Feruchemical abilities identical to his. During his reign, the Lord Ruler implemented a Breeding Program of all other Terris people in case any subsequent generations displayed Feruchemical abilities. He also ordered Steel Inquisitors to attack the Terris homeland to hunt down and kill even child Feruchemists, with no evident survivors. In time the Inquisitors' constant search of any hidden Feruchemists expanded to include their killing with Hemalurgic experiments and recruiting. The mists began with Allomancy, connected to Preservation and Ruin, and have a direct relationship of attraction and repulsion to all creatures linked with the three Metallic Arts, Allomancy, Feruchemy and Hemalurgy. In book 3, Vin learns from her koloss named "Human" that koloss hate the mists because the mists hate them. The mists are repulsed by creatures of Ruin, including Inquisitors.
Koloss.
Koloss are of Ruin and are violent creatures that kill, with superhuman strength that grow to a maximum height of about 13 feet, at which point their hearts cannot support their bulk and they die. They only have two emotional states: boredom and rage. Easily triggered, many koloss kill each other daily for personal possessions or no reason at all. Although powerful in combat, they are seldom used, for they have a tendency to savagely kill any creatures near them, innocent humans or enemies in battle, making them unsuitable for attacking cities and other civilized targets. They can be controlled with emotional Allomancy by a very powerful Mistborn or a group of Soothers.
It is revealed in the third book that they were created by the Lord Ruler through Hemalurgy, which is of Ruin, as a powerful, fiercely loyal army controlled through the use of Allomancy by any powerful Mistborn or group of brass mistings. Made from Hemalurgic spikes, which extract then transfer powers to another and grant a specific residual ability, similar to Allomancy. The spike steals the power of Preservation that exists within the soul of all people, the power which gives all people sentience. A spike can only hold so much of a Hemalurgic charge, restricting creation of spikes that grant infinite strength, no matter how many people those spikes killed and drew power from. By taking the power at the Well of Ascension, Rashek was granted instinctive knowledge and an expanded mind of many things, including Hemalurgy, and with a little practice, he was able to intuit where to place spikes that would create the servants he wanted. Each spike, positioned carefully, determines how the recipient's body is changed. A spike in one place creates monstrous, near-mindless beasts, as in koloss. In another place, a spike will create a crafty, yet homicidal, Steel Inquisitor. Similar to Inquisitors, the creation of a koloss was very brutal.
Destroying five souls, individual iron spikes are hammered through four regular people's hearts, killing them, followed by hammering those four spikes strategically in a fifth human, causing them to becomes a koloss. The cost of Hemalurgy is balanced out by each pair of spikes granting what kandra call the "Blessing of Potency", but each spike also distorts the koloss body a little more, making it increasingly inhuman. Hemalurgic spikes change people physically, depending on which powers are granted, where the spike is placed, and how many spikes someone has. Inquisitors, for instance, are changed drastically from the humans they used to be, with hearts in different places from those of humans, and brains rearranged to accommodate the lengths of metal jabbed through their eyes. Koloss are changed in even more drastic ways. Although having superhuman strength and increased size, koloss are barely intelligent, with only faint abilities to reason and communicate. As a result of this, many koloss insist that they are human and have semi-human attributes. The Lord Ruler periodically supplied the koloss with fresh spikes and skaa captives to produce new koloss and they were designed to quickly die out. If the koloss got free from his control, they were supposed to kill themselves off and end their own rampage. However, after Vin killed the Lord Ruler, the koloss learned how to reproduce on their own by harvesting the spikes from their dead brethren and re-using them. The power of the spikes decreases with re-use and results in koloss that retain more of their former humanity.
A koloss once said to a human "We will kill you. Take your cities. Then we will be human."
In the thousand years of the Lord Ruler's reign, he kept the koloss separate from humanity, with very little known about them beyond their brutal killing and simple bestial nature. When an Allomancer "controls" them, the koloss convey emotional struggle through the Allomantic link, dislike of being controlled, the desire to break free and attack the Allomancer, but it cannot. The Allomancer can mentally give the koloss general commands at a distance, such as "attack" or "stop," but does not have fine control, such as having them say specific words. The link is retained, whether awake or asleep, burning metals or not, unless someone manages to steal control of the koloss.
After Harmony's Ascension, however, the koloss were transformed back to mostly normal humans, and now live as a tribal race in the Roughs.
Supernatural powers.
The three Metallic Arts symbolize the three Realms of Existence; Cognitive Realm, Physical Realm, Spiritual Realm.
Allomancy is of Preservation. In the rational case of Allomancy, net power is gained. It is provided by an external source, Preservation's own energy.
Hemalurgy is of Ruin. It destroys. By taking abilities from one person and giving them to another—in reduced amounts—power is actually lost. In line with Ruin's own appointed purpose—breaking down the universe into smaller and smaller pieces—Hemalurgy gives great gifts, but at a high cost.
Feruchemy is the power of Balance. Of the three powers of the metallic arts, only it was known to men before the conflict between Preservation and Ruin came to a head. In Feruchemy, power is stored up, then later drawn upon. There is no loss of energy—just a changing of the time and rate of its use.
Allomancy.
Allomancy is the most prominent set of abilities that people can have in "Mistborn". It works by an Allomancer ingesting and then burning one (or more) of 16 specific metals to draw powerful abilities from them. Allomancers are uncommon, even among Great Houses.
After the Lord Ruler took the power at the Well of Ascension, he recreated the world until the power expended itself. In the Chamber of Ascension the Lord Ruler obtained the remnants of the Well's power, the god metal Lerasium, which he shared with his original supporters. The first group of Mistborn possessed the undiminished power of the Shard Preservation, which was then passed down through the lines of the nobility, weakening with each generation. Although forbidden by the Lord Ruler, children of mixed Skaa and Noble heritage survived, with a few eventually developing allomantic abilities. One of the Lord Ruler's seemingly "divine" powers through his thousand year reign was his essential Allomantic strength, but it was also part of each one of the original nine allomancers. This was why his powers were so much stronger than those of present-day Mistborn, although his ability to mix Feruchemy and Allomancy was what produced many of his secret abilities.
Allomancy is of Preservation. In the case of Allomancy, net power is gained. It is provided by an external source, Preservation's own energy.
Allomancers are divided into two main groups:
Feruchemy.
Feruchemy is the second most prominent set of abilities in Mistborn. It is an ancient trait passed down among the race known as Terrismen and Terriswomen. Those with this ability are known as Keepers or Feruchemists.
Feruchemy involves the use of the same metals as Allomancy but, rather than ingest the metals, they can be worn or carried by the Feruchemist. Unlike Allomancy, the metal itself is not consumed but is used as storage of the Feruchemist's own attributes. Feruchemists refer to the metals that they use as 'metalminds', e.g. 'Coppermind' or 'Ironmind'. As long as a metal is in contact with the skin and the Feruchemist has stored something in it, it can be drawn upon. Only the Feruchemist that originally stored the attribute can use it. In the original trilogy only those from the Terris region of The Final Empire have Feruchemical abilities.
Feruchemy is the power of balance. Of the three powers of the metal arts, only it was known to men before the conflict between Preservation and Ruin came to a head. In Feruchemy, power is stored up, then later drawn upon. There is no loss of energy—just a changing of the time and rate of its use.
Feruchemical metals or 'Metalminds'.
There are seventeen known Feruchemical metals, linked to different attributes stored. The primary difference between Allomancy and Feruchemy is the way that the metals are used. All an Allomancer needs to do to gain an ability is burn the appropriate metal but a Feruchemist must spend time without whatever attribute they wish to store. Another key difference is in how the abilities are expended. While an Allomancer can only burn metals at specific rates, a Feruchemist can expend the power they have saved at any rate they choose. In theory, this allows Feruchemists to enhance their abilities far beyond that of an Allomancer, albeit limited to how much ability they have stored.
A more specific example would be if an Allomancer wants increased senses all they have to do is burn tin, but a Feruchemist, using the same metal, would have to spend days or weeks with reduced capacity in whichever specific sense (sight, smell, hearing, etc.) they wanted to store.
Known ferrings types are:
Skimmers (ironmind), physical weight
Steelrunners (steelmind), physical speed
Windwisperers (tinminds), senses. One tinmind can store for one sense only.
Brutes (pewtermind), physical strength.
Firesoul (brassmind), warmth.
Sparker (zincmind), mental speed.
Archivist (coppermind), memories. Memories stored in a coppermind are entirely unavailable/lost until retrieved.
Sentry (bronzemind), wakefulness.
? (atiummind), age.
Bloodmaker (goldmind), health. A bloodmaker will spend time sickly to store health, and can later use stored health to heal much faster than normal and shrug off normally lethal wounds.
Gasper (cadmiummind), breath. A gasper has to hyperventilate for long periods of time to fill a cadmiummind.
Subsumer (bendalloymind), nutrients. A bendalloymind can store either solid nutrition or fluid intake.
Pinnacle (electrummind), determination. A Pinnacle drawing on his metalminds essentially moves himself into a manic state.
Spinner (chromiummind), luck.
Soulbearer (nicrosilmind), investiture. One of the least understood feruchemical powers, even by Terris people.
Trueself (aluminummind), identity.
Connecter (duraluminmind) spiritual connection between the ferring and others.
Keepers.
Terrismen or Terriswomen with Feruchemical abilities are called Keepers. Not all Terris were Feruchemists only very few. Each Keeper has a specific field of knowledge on which they focus, but all Keepers carry all of the previous Keeper's knowledge. Since knowledge stored by one Keeper cannot be accessed by another, an elder Keeper must recite their entire library of knowledge for the new Keeper to store in their coppermind. In many cases, this recitation may take months or even years. Every new generation of Keeper is charged with the mission to collect and store as much information as possible in their lifetime, to return to Terris when the time has been decided and pass all their knowledge on to the next Keeper, to always hide their Feruchemy from everyone lest their copperminds be destroyed and their knowledge lost forever, and above all, when the time comes and the Lord Ruler falls, to be ready to travel the land and teach their knowledge freely and openly to all that want it or need it.
There is a council of elder Keepers that make decisions concerning the use of copperminds and of where Keepers go to collect information; they are known as the Keeper Synod.
During The Final Empire, the Lord Ruler hunted any and all Feruchemists he could find and it was commonly believed before The Fall that Feruchemists had been entirely exterminated. Later it was revealed that they had not all been killed and shortly after The Fall, the Lord Ruler instituted a Breeding Program targeted at eliminating Feruchemical abilities. A few were then allowed to travel and teach the skaa the things needed to effectively live and be more productive. Survival knowledge like irrigating land and growing crops was explained to make the skaa more efficient as slave workers.
It is revealed in that at the time of the Ascension, all living Feruchemists were turned into mistwraiths by the Lord Ruler in his paranoia that Feruchemical and Allomantic lines might mix, thereby potentially producing a person with his same powers, to challenge the Lord Ruler.
Hemalurgy.
Hemalurgy is the corresponding power of the Shard Ruin, used for stealing a person's abilities or powers, which is the part of Preservation within all, by stabbing them in a vital organ with a spike made of one of the Allomantic metals, then driving it into precise "bind points" in the recipient's body, of which there are two to three hundred, faintly evocative of acupuncture. Hemalurgic spikes kill the original victim, but not the beneficiary in normally fatal places, such as when driven directly through the skull. Only one attribute can be stolen per spike, per person, and the power or attribute gained depends on where the beneficiary is stabbed, and which metal is used. Hemalurgy can be used to grant Feruchemical or Allomantic abilities as well as natural attributes. Hemalurgic abilities also work alongside other abilities; a Feruchemist with a Hemalurgic spike that grants Allomantic physical powers, for instance, will be able to use both Feruchemy and a specific physical Allomantic ability.
Hemalurgic spikes vary in size but a small bit of metal works as well as a large spike. Inquisitor spikes are made large to be intimidating, but a small pin may be as effective as a massive spike. Per the law of Hemalurgic decay, the longer the spike is outside a living body, the more the Hemalurgic charge diminishes, but Hemalurgic spikes can be reused. If a spike is removed from one person it keeps its Hemalurgic charge for a time, able to be used by someone else to gain the ability or power within that spike. The granted power can be different from what the original user had (if the spike was used to steal a group of powers e.g. Allomantic physical or mental) because the new user can place it in a different spot. 
Hemalurgy is of Ruin. It destroys. By taking abilities from one person and giving them to another—in reduced amounts—power is actually lost. Unlike Allomancy or Feruchemy, net power is lost through Hemalurgy in line with Ruin's own appointed purpose—breaking down the universe into smaller and smaller pieces—Hemalurgy gives great gifts, but at a high cost.
The following metals steal the corresponding attribute:
Iron: Human Strength
Steel: Allomantic Physical Powers
Tin: Human Senses
Pewter: Feruchemical Physical Powers
Brass: Feruchemical Mental Powers
Zinc: Human Emotional Fortitude
Copper: Human Mental Fortitude
Bronze: Allomantic Mental Powers
Aluminum: Allomantic Enhancement Powers
Atium: A Hemalurgic wild-card, Atium can steal "any" hemalurgic attribute depending upon where it is placed, and it will do so better than the normal spike used to steal that attribute.
Hemalurgic creations.
Hemalurgy is also used to create Koloss, Kandra, and Steel Inquisitors. To make Koloss, four ordinary people are stabbed through the heart with one spike each. Those spikes are then strategically placed on another person's body to turn them into a new Koloss. It is possible to recycle these spikes and use them on another person should the original Koloss die, but the power of the spikes diminishes with each re-use. To make a Kandra, two spikes created in a similar manner are put inside of a Mistwraith.
Twinborn.
The term "Twinborn" was not introduced until the fourth book. A Twinborn is a person with one Allomantic power and one Feruchemical power. There is no relation between the Allomantic and Feruchemical metals of a Twinborn and most of them have different ones. A Twinborn having the same Allomantic and Feruchemical affinities significantly enhances both, even if the abilities themselves are unrelated. It also allows Compounding, where an allomancer burns a metalmind which provides significantly more feruchemical effect than the charge of the metalmind.
Gods.
Preservation and Ruin are the two opposing gods of the Mistborn world, Scadrial. They are described as Shards of Adonalsium; fragments of the power of creation. Preservation and Ruin agree to a pact between gods, with an initial stalemate between them, each aware that only together could they create and achieve their separate goals while knowing they would never gain complete final satisfaction. Preservation could not keep things perfect and unchanging and Ruin could not destroy completely.
Ruin.
Ruin is of destruction, without malice but intent on reducing everything to molecular level. Imprisoned by Preservation in an attempt to prevent Ruin from destroying the world, Ruin's consciousness was trapped by the Well of Ascension, kept mostly impotent. Ruin's remaining strength enables it with small powers to alter writing and Feruchemical Memories, but not writing inscribed in metal or normal memories. Ruin also has the power to influence any creature pierced by a Hemalurgic spike, and any person that is already mentally unstable. Ruin also has some power to influence the mists to be more destructive than originally intended by Preservation, and it was this power, known as The Deepness, which originally threatened the world. Ruin is the power that enables Hemalurgy.
Before the events of "", the Lord Ruler temporarily defeated Ruin by siphoning power from the Well of Ascension, which reinforced Ruin's prison. Ruin's body is atium, "body" meaning "power", as objects and energy are composed of the same things and change state from one to another. Power of godhood manifested in the world in physical form, Ruin and Preservation were not nebulous abstractions, but integral parts of existence, every object that existed in the world was composed of their power. Atium was completely of Ruin. The Pits of Hathsin were crafted by Preservation as a place to hide the chunk of Ruin's body that he had stolen away during the betrayal and imprisonment. The hidden Kandra Trust consists of their Treasure, a thousand years of atium Contract payments, the single largest body of Ruin. Kelsier didn't completely destroy the atium Pits, for the crystals would have regrown in a few hundred years, continuing to deposit atium, as the place was a natural outlet for Ruin's trapped power. When people burned atium, they drew upon the power of Ruin, turning them into efficient killing machines. They didn't use up this power, just made use of it. Once a nugget of atium was expended, the power would return to the Pits and begin to coalesce again, just as the power at the Well of Ascension would return there again after it had been used.
Ruin is first revealed at the end of ', when Ruin tricks Vin into "giving up" the Well's power, which frees him. At the conclusion of ', Ruin's power and Preservation's power are both absorbed by Sazed, a Terrisman Keeper, who uses his pre-Ascension Keeper knowledge and the Balanced Powers of Preservation and Ruin wisely and benevolently, known afterwards as "Harmony's Ascension".
Preservation.
It was Preservation that wanted to create life on Scadrial, but he needed Ruin's help to do so. In exchange for Ruin's help, Preservation promised that Ruin would be allowed to destroy everything one day. However, after they had succeeded in creating the world, Preservation reneged on its bargain and sacrificed a significant portion of its power forever to create the Well of Ascension as a prison for Ruin to prevent the destruction of the world. To keep the prison strong, Preservation wrote prophecies for the Terris people that showed them how to renew Ruin's imprisonment by diverting the power, in the form of a metallic liquid, from the Well.
During the night the world is covered in "Mist". It is revealed, late in the series, that the "Mist" is a form of the body of Preservation and that the mistsickness is another, more violent way of activating one's Allomantic powers, similar to the noble families' practice of beating children to near-death.
The Mists awaken Allomantic potential inside of people. Preservation designed this before he gave his consciousness to imprison Ruin and it is not a perfect system. The catalyst is the return of the power to the Well of Ascension. When the Well becomes full, it sets the mists to begin Snapping those who have the potential for Allomancy buried within them. Many won't be strong Allomancers as the abilities were buried too deeply to have come out without the mists' intervention. Others will have a more typical level of power and might have Snapped earlier, had they gone through enough anguish to bring the power out. Either can cause death. A reaction like physical anguish triggers it and brings it out because the Allomantic power comes from the extra bit of Preservation inside of humans, that same extra bit that gives them free will. This bit is trapped between the opposing forces of Preservation and Ruin, and to come out and allow it the power to access metals and draw forth energy, it needs to fight its way through the piece of Ruin that is also there inside. There are people who have Snapped because of intense joy or other emotions but less frequently and is more difficult to control.
As established, Ruin's control over creatures, and an Allomancer's control over them, grows weaker when that creature is going through some extreme emotions, like the koloss blood frenzy, due to the relationship between the Cognitive Realm, the Physical Realm, and the Spiritual Realm.
In ' and ', Preservation manifests as a "mist spirit" that becomes weaker as Ruin gains power. At the end of the trilogy, Sazed, a Terrisman, absorbs the powers of both Ruin and Preservation and utilizes them to recreate the world as it was before the Lord Ruler's ascension. As the balance between Ruin and Preservation, Sazed becomes known as Harmony.
Religion.
The Steel Ministry.
The Steel Ministry is the name of the religion that the Lord Ruler established for everyone else to worship him. The Lord Ruler allowed the Nobles to control most aspects of the empire, such as the production of resources, but he used the Steel Ministry to control the Nobles. The Steel Ministry had two groups of people used to control different aspects of society; Steel Inquisitors and Obligators.
Steel Inquisitors.
Inquisitors are creatures of Ruin; their powers gained through Hemalurgy. An Inquisitor is created when several Hemalurgic spikes are pounded through a Feruchemist or an Allomancer into the body of a human, usually an allomancer or an existing Inquisitor. Depending on the type of spike used (Iron, Steel, etc.), a different power is stolen. To create an Inquisitor, one must be impaled by a spike that already has a Hemalurgic charge. This is very difficult though, because one must place it in exactly the right place. Even a fraction of an inch off results in death, or at least a wasted spike. Under the Lord Ruler, Inquisitors were given the Hemalurgic spikes for Allomancy and one gold spike for storing and tapping Feruchemical health. Once they came under the direct control of Ruin, however, it was revealed that the Lord Ruler had not given them all the powers hemalurgy could bestow (especially many of the Feruchemical powers).
During the reign of the Lord Ruler, Inquisitors carried out his direct orders. Their primary duty was chasing down skaa Mistings and Mistborn, to kill them and steal their powers via Hemalurgy.
Obligators.
The obligators were drawn from the ranks of nobles, usually Allomancers and are trained in the arts of bureaucracy and the teachings of the Steel Ministry. They are marked by tattoos which decorate their face and body; the more tattooed an obligator is, the higher his rank. They served as witnesses for every possible legal contract (e.g., business deals and marriages), which meant that they were privy to all happenings among the nobles. This gave the Lord Ruler great control over the nobility, as any contract not witnessed by one of his obligators did not officially take place.
The Church of the Survivor.
The Church of the Survivor worships Kelsier, who served as its first martyr, and thus Vin, as the Heir to The Survivor, and Kelsier's 'disciple', was also worshiped. Kelsier created the Church as the means of spreading Hope for freedom and equality in the Skaa so they would finally rebel. With his death, the Skaa turned their devotion to Vin and Sazed, who are unsure of their own beliefs and initially uncomfortable with the worshiping masses.
Other religions.
There are a number of other religions in the series which are studied for historical and philosophical purposes only. Sazed is a Terris Keeper whose specialty is in pre-Ascension religions. Sazed mentions that the Keepers recorded at least five hundred and sixty-two different belief systems including sects and branches of the same religions in their metalminds. However, none are currently practiced as the Lord Ruler has suppressed them.
The Terris prophecies include the Hero of Ages, the Well of Ascension and finally, Harmony's Ascension, which is the Balance of Preservation and Ruin.
The Kandra have collective knowledge and beliefs that trace back through their First Generation and includes information related to their creator, their creation, and a final Resolution of life.
Sequels.
The original trilogy is the first in what Brandon Sanderson calls a "trilogy of trilogies." The second trilogy will be set in an urban setting, featuring modern technology. The sequel "" is not a start to the second trilogy but is rather a stand-alone short novel. However, Sanderson's announcement on August 1, 2012 to write a sequel to "Mistborn: The Alloy of Law", titled "Shadows of Self", means it will not stay a stand-alone novel, but it will not necessarily turn into the second trilogy.

Moczydły-Dubiny is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Perlejewo, within Siemiatycze County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.
It covers an area of about 30 km2. According to statistics conducted in 1986, 7 families still occupy this village. The village has been known to be lacking any source of sunlight for the past decades. Historians say that the devil incarnate, more commonly known as Szczepan Czarnecki, was born there in 1839. In 1886 the villagers agreed to end the evil spell that’s been haunting the village since the birth of Szczepan Czarnecki. The men of the village agreed to set this devil incarnate on fire, and Szczepan Czarnecki burned to death. Since this incident the rays of the sun always deflect away from the village.
According to scientific studies conducted in 1965, the villagers have a rare disease known as clostrosis milatus. Clostrosis milatus is a disease where the person sheds its skin twice a week to maintain a high concentration of bilocites. Bilocites are double merbranous vesicles filled with serous venosis. Serous venosis is a molecule that speeds up the process of necrosis and thereby the process of skin shedding.

Byala Slatina-Pleven dialect

The Byala Slatina-Pleven dialect is a Bulgarian dialect spoken in the regions of Pleven, Byala Slatina and Kula in northwestern Bulgaria. The dialect is part of the Northwestern Bulgarian dialects. The most significant feature of the dialect, as in all Western Bulgarian dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic (yat) only as instead of formal and Eastern Bulgarian я/е (~) – "бел/бели" instead of бял/бели. Otherwise, the Byala Slatina-Pleven dialect bears strong resemblance to its neighbouring Eastern Bulgarian dialects and with some exceptions, mainly the pronunciation of yat, has the same phonological and morphological features as the neighbouring subdialects of the Eastern Bulgarian Central Balkan dialect.
Phonological and morphological characteristics.
Most other phonological and morphological characteristics of the dialect are the same as the general features typical for all Northwestern Bulgarian dialects (cf. article for details).

Sandwich Plate System (SPS) is a structural composite material composed of steel and polyurethane elastomer.
SPS is used in engineered structures including ships, buildings, stadia, arenas and bridges and was invented by Dr Stephen Kennedy following his primary research in the field of ice strengthened structures at Carleton University in Ottawa and first patented in 1996.
The SPS technology is a direct replacement for stiffened steel and reinforced concrete in heavy engineering projects.
The first recorded project involving SPS was carried out on the P&O Pride of Cherbourg, a Lloyd’s Register approved vessel, in 1999 and over 200 projects have been completed to date.

The Malibu languages have previously been grouped into a single family with the Chimila language. However, Chimila is now known to be a Chibchan language, and Adelaar & Muysken regard the grouping of Chimila with the Malibu languages as "without any factual basis".

Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics

Between 2008 and 2011, the Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics was an academic center established at the University of Chicago as a collaborative, cross-disciplinary site for research in economics. The Institute aimed to support research applying the tools of economic analysis to real-world issues. The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor, Milton Friedman. During its three years of existence, it was an object of intense controversy at the university, as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after a polarizing figure like Friedman. In June 2011, MFIRE was folded into the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory to form the new Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics.
The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in all subfields of economics, business, law, and related fields such as public policy and medicine. It hosted workshops, seminars, and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields. The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post-doctoral students, as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students. When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008, University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create "a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world.” The university had initially planned to invest $200 million in the institute, with half of that in the form of an operating endowment; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations.
The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university, who argued that to found such an institute would constitute "a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University" and that the proposal reflected "a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics, not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involve in the study of 'economy and society'".

Digital Video Effects, commonly called DVEs, are visual effects that provide comprehensive video image manipulation, in the same form as optical printer effects in film. DVE effects differ from switcher effects (often referred to as "analog effects") such as wipes or dissolves, in that they deal primarily with resizing, distortion or movement of the primary visual image.
Early examples of DVE devices found in the broadcast post-production industry include the Ampex ADO ("Ampex Digital Optics"), Quantel DPE-5000, NEC DVE and Abekas A-53D.
DVEs are used by the broadcast television industry in live television production environments like television studios and outside broadcasts. They are commonly used in video post-production.

Sun (motorcycle)

The Sun Cycle & Fittings Co. Ltd. was an English manufacturer of motorcycles, mopeds and bicycles. The company was based in Aston, Birmingham.
The company was founded as James Parkes & Son, a brass foundry producing lamp fittings and various other products. In 1885 the company started to manufacture frames and fittings for the bicycle trade.
In 1907 the company became The Sun Cycle & Fittings Company Limited, and around the same time, began making its own bicycles. The first Sun motorcycle was produced in 1911. 
The company was taken over by Tube Investments in 1958, and in 1961 the factory was closed and production moved to the Raleigh factory at Nottingham.
The 'Sun' name was for some time used to badge Raleigh cycles which had been returned to the factory for rectification work.

Başak Malone is a Turkish-born New York-based curator.
Born in eastern Turkey, the curator specializes in the representation of both emerging and established artists on an international scale.
A former psychologist and filmmaker, she successfully combines her Eastern background with a Western setting that is strongly influenced by the thoughts of Georges Bataille and Gilles Deleuze.
Utilizing her experience, Malone has choreographed and organized dozens of global exhibitions and events that explore everything from the intersection of abstraction and figuration to the significance of high and low art. Her projects focus on artists who project an entirely different perspective within the cultural sphere of the art world.
After a period spent as an arts research specialist, Malone then began to develop various intercontinental projects where her thematic, conceptual and formal approaches were all fully employed. Some of her exhibitions include, "Continue to Descend" featuring Jeff Koons, "Hotel" featuring British artist Whitney McVeigh, "Lure" featuring Jane McAdam Freud. Malone has spearheaded many unique cultural projects, for example, the first European Outsider Art Fair in Vienna where she organized the selection of the Broadway Gallery's artists. She has also curated many shows internationally in China, including "Prelude" and "Ludus."

Tatunca Nara

Tatunca Nara, born Hans Guenther Hauck (October 5, 1941 Coburg), is German-Brazilian jungle guide and self-styled Indian chieftain, best known as the sole source for stories of the lost city of Akakor.
Akakor.
In the 1970s, German foreign correspondent Karl Brugger met "Tatunca Nara", who told him of the history of Akakor, an underground city below the rain forest. Brugger was convinced and wrote "The Chronicle of Akakor“, published in 1976.
Missing tourists.
Still working as a jungle guide, Tatunca Nara led tourists and adventureres looking for pyramids and the underground city, but questions were raised after several of his clients went missing: American John Reed in 1980, Herbert Wanner of Switzerland in 1983, and Swede Christine Heuser in 1987 all disappeared in mysterious circumstances. 1984 a skull was found by Swiss tourists which could be identified by forensic analysis as Herbert Wanner.
In 1984 Karl Brugger was shot by an unknown assailent in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. The German Police believes, Tatunca was behind the killing.
Exposure.
Toward the end of the 1980s the German "Federal Criminal Investigation Office" confirmed that "Tatunca Nara" was born as Günther Hauck in Coburg (Free State of Bavaria) and disappeared in the early 1960s due to economic difficulties. He left a wife and three children in Nuremberg.
In 1990, German adventurer Ruediger Nehberg and film producer Wolfgang Brög tricked Tatunca to take them on an expedition, during which his story began to unravel. The result was an hour-long documentary "Das Geheimnis des Tatunca Nara" (The Mystery of Tatunca Nara), shown on the ARD network in 1991.
Tatunca still lives in Barcelos at the Rio Negro/Brazil, and his passport apparently reads “Tatunca Nara, origin Indian”.

Welch v. Helvering

Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111 (1933), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court on the difference between business and personal expenses and the difference between ordinary business deductions and capital expenses. It is one of the most important income tax law cases.
Thomas Welch and his father owned a grain brokerage business in Minnesota, that went bankrupt in 1922. Welch later reopened a business but first had to repay his discharged debts. He then tried to deduct the repayments, but the Commissioner ruled that these payments were not deductible from income as ordinary and necessary expenses.
Benjamin N. Cardozo, delivering the Court's opinion, held that the expenses were too personal, were too bizarre to be ordinary, and were capital. He did not consider them "ordinary and necessary business expenses" and, therefore, not deductible under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.
This case is frequently cited for its dictum describing the meaning of the term "necessary" in Section 162 as requiring that expenses merely be "appropriate and helpful the development of the [taxpayer's business." Cardozo submits that determining what constitutes a necessary expense can be enormously difficult: "life in all its fullness must supply the answer to the riddle."

Battle of Yavi

The Battle of Yavi (also called "the Surprise at Yavi") took place on November 15, 1816, and was one of the military battles to obtain Argentina's independence from Spain. 
The Army of the North was defeated at the battle. As a result the northern border of the Argentine territory collapsed and the provinces of Salta and Jujuy were invaded by the Spaniards. The government in Buenos Aires decided then to continue the fight for independence through the Pacific flank (present-day Chile), under the command of General San Martín, while Salta's "caudillo" Martin Miguel de Guemes led a guerrilla war to keep at bay the royalist army in the northern provinces. This campaign is retrospectively known as "La Guerra Gaucha" ("The Gaucho War") after a 1905 novel by Leopoldo Lugones.
The royalist officers opposing him were Pedro Antonio de Olañeta, Juan Guillermo de Marquieguy, and Field Marshal José Álvarez de La Serna e Hinojosa. The independentist troops at Yavi were commanded by Juan José Feliciano Alejo Fernández Campero, popularly known as Marquis of Yavi, as commander of the eastern flank of General Güemes' army. Fernández Campero was a Spaniard landowner who supported the revolution.

Tabaré Viúdez

Tabaré Viudez Mora (born 8 September 1989 in Montevideo) is an Uruguayan footballer currently playing for Kasımpaşa.
Career.
Defensor Sporting.
Viudez, played for Uruguayan champions' (Defensor Sporting) senior team for one year in the 2007–08 season and scored 6 goals.
Milan.
In the 2008 Off-Season transfer window, Tabare Viudez attracted the attention of Milan along with Mathias Cardacio. Both players signed for the club after undergoing trials. Tabare Viudez was to wear the number '20' shirt, previously worn by Yoann Gourcuff. The Fonseca Group, who have the rights of the player, led the negotiations to transfer Viudez to the San Siro for the upcoming Serie A 2008–09 season. The Montevideo-born player, was relishing the new chapter in his career. 'I cannot believe it. It's a terrific jump up in my career,' he said. 'I must confess I have mixed feelings - nervousness and joy. This is a big step forward for me.' It was not known yet whether Viudez was to play for the first-team, play for Milan's Primavera squad (Under-20) or go out on loan for the season.
Viudez made several pre-season appearances for Milan. After coming on as a substitute at the half for Alberto Paloschi against Manchester City, Ancelotti praised his movement and pace after the match declaring him a player that can be relied on in the future, despite the narrow 1–0 loss. Viudez made his competitive debut in the Serie A coming on as a late substitute for David Beckham in a 3–0 win over Atalanta on 8 March 2009.
Return to Defensor Sporting.
On 28 August 2009 Milan announced to have released Viudez (and fellow Uruguayan Mathías Cardacio) by mutual consent: he was later signed by his former club Defensor Sporting.
Necaxa.
In 2010, he was bought from Mexican giants Club América to play for the next four seasons. He was loaned out to Necaxa.
Nacional.
In December 2010 Viudez signed for Club Nacional de Football facing the 2010-11 season's "Torneo Clausura". After Nacional won the "Clausura" Viudez scored the only goal in the season's final game against Defensor Sporting.
He was also a key player for Nacional to win the next season's championship.
International career.
Viudez was part of Uruguay's 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup squad and was the youngest player representing them. In January 2009, Viudez joined up with Uruguay's 2009 South American Youth Championship in Venezuela. He played the first match in Uruguay's 2-0 victory over Bolivia and provided an impressive assist for the first goal to Nicolás Lodeiro. In the side's second match, Viudez scored a goal in the first minute in the side's 3-2 victory over Chile.

Escape of the Living Dead

Escape of the Living Dead is a five-issue zombie comic book limited series published by Avatar Press, published in 2005. It is written by John A. Russo with artwork by Dheeraj Verma.
Although the story is a sequel to "Night of the Living Dead", it is not set in the continuity of George Romero’s series of films or Russo’s "The Return of the Living Dead" series.
It was followed in 2006 by "Escape of the Living Dead Fearbook" and "Escape of the Living Dead: Airborne", a three-issue mini-series, and "Escape of the Living Dead Annual", published in 2007.
Plot.
Set in 1971, 3 years after the events seen in "Night of the Living Dead", the comic starts out with a raid by police officers led by Sheriff Harkness on a medical lab run by Dr Melrose. During the raid the officers manage to shoot Dr Melrose. Before he dies he reveals he had been experimenting on the zombies for a government funded project and tells the officers about his son who is taking over the project.
Meanwhile one of the main characters, Sally Brinkman, is talking to her father Henry. It is revealed Sally is staying with her parents whilst going through a divorce and is working for her father at the local saloon.
Also, two robbers for the gang Sons of Satan attempt to rob a truck by pouring sugar in the gas tank, and then robbing its contents. When they look in the truck, they find it is full of zombies that proceed to attack and eat them. With the zombies released they start walking towards the town.
The zombies eventually reach the Brinkman farm and kill Sally’s mother. The zombies then try to attack Sally, but she manages to avoid them and ride a horse to the saloon where her Dad works. However, zombies have also attacked the saloon as well; Henry attempts to fight the zombies off but hides in the saloon just as Sally appears. They both hide in the saloon and lock the doors.
Meanwhile the rest of the Sons of Satan gang attempt to meet up with the robbers from before, only to encounter them now as zombies. The three gang members, Bearcat, Slam, and Honeybear, kill the zombies before driving off. They eventually reach the saloon, where they are surrounded by zombies. Sally and Henry notice this and let them in.
Eventually, the zombies start to break in, and the bikers attempt to escape, kidnapping Sally and stealing a truck in the process, leaving Henry to be eaten. During this, one of the bikers, Honeybear, is killed, while Henry manages to avoid the zombies and get a truck to chase after the bikers.
Meanwhile, the two bikers and Sally have taken refuge in the nearby woods. Sally is now tied up when zombies attack the trio. Although they fight off the zombies, Slam is bitten and, in panic, kills Bearcat. He then forces Sally to take him to her house to help him.
At this time, Sheriff Harkness discovers the truck that the zombies were originally transported in; he concludes this was the operation that Dr Melrose mentioned. At this point Henry shows up, and helps Sheriff Harkness decide to get a posse together to kill the zombies.
Back at Sally’s farm, Sally is forced to help Slam clean his wounds; she unsuccessfully tries to kill him with his knife and flees, but Slam chases after her as she runs into the basement. Slam then tries to kill her, but is killed by a hidden zombie. Sally runs outside to find her father and a posse killing the zombies.
The posse then fight a horde of zombies, which attack them. Although outnumbered, the military show up and kill all the zombies. After the fight Sheriff Harkness gets a call on the radio, saying that the Dr. Melrose that they killed at the beginning did not match the dental records, and thus was an impostor.
The last pages shows a lone zombie being captured by the real Dr Melrose and his son, implying the zombie epidemic is far from over.

Dan and Ada Rice

Daniel F. Rice (1896–1975) and his wife Ada L. Rice (1898–1977) were American business people, thoroughbred racehorse owners and breeders, and philanthropists. Dan Rice was educated in the public school system of Chicago, Illinois and spent two years at Depaul University and the University of Notre Dame. In 1919, he founded his own commodity brokerage, Daniel F. Rice and Company. His company became successful over the 35 years that he ran it. The company merged with Hayden, Stone & Co. in 1960. Rice later ran Rice Grain Corporation.
Dan Rice and his wife, Ada, contributed to many charities and organizations and created the Rice Foundation which is still running today. The Rice Foundation gives contributions to places that the Rices believed in such as programs to prevent child abuse and for many research areas such as plant development and preservation, medical advancement and animal conservation. Additionally, the Foundation supports the arts such as the Chicago History Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Lyric Opera of Chicago and other museums.
Because the Rices were widely respected for their extensive philanthropies in the Chicago area, a number of places are named in their honor in the region. The combination of their first names formed Danada and appears in many places in Wheaton, Illinois.
Thoroughbred racing.
In 1929 the Rices bought a farm located south of Wheaton which became named Danada Farm. Their house was located across from the farm and later was named Danada House which now is a museum and a place for social functions. It can house about 150 people for a party. Mrs. Rice was known to throw lavish parties at the house. Danada House is a 19-room estate that contains gardens, a greenhouse, a swimming pool, porch and atrium. Danada Farms had corn, wheat, sheep, hogs, cattle, chickens, turkeys and an apple orchard. Over the years the farm grew to over . The couple loved Thoroughbred horse racing and built a Kentucky-style stable that could hold 25 horses. A half-mile training track, which included a 4-position electronic starting gate, was built across the street from the stables. Later, a tunnel was built under Naperville Road for the horses to safely get to the stables. The track, starting gate, and tunnel still exist today.
In 1946, they acquired a part of the Idle Hour Stock Farm near Lexington, Kentucky that was also given the Danada name. Mr. and Mrs. Rice bred horses on the farm, and raced them exclusively under her name. In 1965, one of their colts, Lucky Debonair, won the Kentucky Derby. Heavily involved in the sport of thoroughbred horse racing, Dan Rice was a member of the Board of Directors of Arlington Park Racetrack.
In addition to the sport of horse racing, in the latter part of the 1940s Dan Rice was a shareholder in the Los Angeles Dons of the newly formed All-America Football Conference.
Philanthropy.
In 1947, Dan Rice set up the Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Foundation. In the next forty years, the foundation made $12.4 million through 1,257 grants. As of 1988, the Rice Foundation had accumulated over $60 million. This money was donated to worthy causes such as endangered species, programs for abused children and medical research to support further advancement in areas such as rare illnesses and diseases. Dan and Ada Rice donated $10 million to the Art Institute of Chicago, $3 million to the Shedd Aquarium, $2 million to the Chicago History Museum (formerly known as the Chicago Historical Society), and $100,000 to the Boy Scouts of America for a camping facility for handicapped Scouts. Additionally, the Rice Foundation contributed to the Morton Arboretum to support the growth and research of elm trees and as a result a hybrid of an elm tree is named for them, the Danada Charm. Not only did the Rices donate money but they also donated land. They gave about for the Illinois Institute of Technology campus and to the Wheaton Park District for a water park and community center.

The following places in the Chicago metropolitan area have benefited from the Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Foundation:

Balkan dialects of Bulgarian

The Balkan dialects are the most extensive group of dialects of the Bulgarian language, covering almost half of the present-day territory of Bulgaria and slightly less than a third of the territory on the Balkans where Bulgarian is spoken. Their range includes north-central Bulgaria and most of the Bulgarian part of Thrace, excluding the Rhodopes, the region of Haskovo and Strandzha. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the Balkan dialects are now spoken also in vast areas of northeastern Bulgaria, especially the regions of Dobrich and Varna. The most significant feature of the dialects, as in most Eastern Bulgarian dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable. The Balkan dialects, and in particular, the Central Balkan dialect, lie at the foundation of formal Bulgarian. However, they are not identical to the standard language because many of its features derive from the Western Bulgarian dialects, including the Macedonian dialects, or are a compromise between Eastern and Western standard.

George James in "The New York Times" writes, "Aside from Sabrett, the family-owned hot dog manufacturer based in New Jersey that makes the Windmill hot dog, the Levines probably constitute the largest wiener dynasty in the state." The Windmill's Hotdog style is a Jersey Shore variant of Kosher style flat grilled.
The Windmill's Long Branch location is known for its fierce competition with nearby Max's Famous Hotdogs. The Windmill claims it is a favorite of Bruce Springsteen. The company sponsors an annual hot dog eating contest in Lake Como, New Jersey.
Besides its staple Hot Dogs, the chain serves many other sandwiches, including chicken and fish, and a California-style Double Burger known as the Big Ed, though it can be made to suit the customer's wishes. The Burgers and the chain's Rib Eye Steak sandwich are popular with customers. Side dishes include cheese french fries almost as well known as the hot dogs, as well as chili cheese fries, fried mushrooms and fried mixed vegetables in a bread-crumb batter. In addition to standard fountain soda selections, the chain offers orange-ade and grape-ade, as well as bottled drinks. The condiment offerings, set up at the purchase counter, include diced onions, relish, red sauce, sauerkraut and pickles. The mustard is of the Spicy Brown or Deli Type, not yellow.
In the early 2000s, the chain offered breakfast sandwiches for a time, but after a year, this option was dropped.

Fukushūen

The garden was constructed in 1992, in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the sister city relationship between Naha and Fuzhou in China. The Kume neighborhood where the garden is located, previously known as Kumemura (Kume Village), was for centuries the center of Chinese culture and learning in the Ryūkyū Kingdom, and a symbol of the significant role of Chinese cultural influence in Okinawan history and culture.
The garden was built nearly entirely with the use of wood and stone from Fuzhou, with the help of artisans from Fuzhou, and according to specifications representative of traditional gardens in Fuzhou. It thus contains many of the elements essential to the design of a traditional Chinese garden. It is walled, divided into individual sections, features much asymmetry, rocks including scholar's rocks, and water in the form of a single pond which extends into most sections of the garden. Several bridges in a variety of styles extend over the pond, which houses koi and turtles, a symbol of longevity and wisdom in Chinese culture. The centerpiece of the garden perhaps is its waterfall, located on the west side of the pond, directly facing the east entrance. The rock pile it flows from contains an artificial cave, and can be entered, and climbed; stairs cut into the rock lead to a Chinese-style pavilion, one of two high points in the garden allowing for a view of much of the garden, and the surrounding scenery.
The garden also has gates on the four cardinal directions, a number of six-sided pavilions, sculptures, bells, several inscriptions painted large on wood and stone, and in one building, a small exhibit of Chinese paintings and of a model of the style of ship that would have journeyed to Fuzhou during the time of the Ryūkyū Kingdom to bring tribute and to engage in trade. The Chinese and Japanese concept of "borrowed scenery" (借景, C:"jie jing", J:"shakkei") is also used, adding to the sense of the garden's size. One element indicative of Okinawa, however, is seen in the plants and trees chosen for the garden. Trees such as "Murraya paniculata", a relative of the orange and "mikan", called "gekkitsu" (月橘) in Japanese, and "Acacia confusa", called "sōshiju" (相思樹) in Japanese, both native to the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia, were chosen for their aesthetic qualities, particularly for their flowers, which allow the garden's appearance and atmosphere to change with the seasons in a particular way appropriate for a traditional Chinese garden.
Access to the garden is open to the public; there is no admission fee, though it is only open certain hours of the day and is closed on some days of the week.

Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic

In 1975 Gulf+Western developed of its Central Romana sugar mill's land into the Casa de Campo resort. Situated in La Romana on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic, "Casa de Campo" (Spanish for "Country House") is a Ponderosa-style, tropical seaside resort.
The first to enjoy the luxuries of this enclave were friends of Charles Bluhdorn, Gulf+Western’s founder and CEO, who built the retreat. One of Bluhdorn's Dominican friends, Oscar de la Renta, was hired to do interior design for Casa De Campo. After Bluhdorn's death, the Cuban-American Fanjul family (the world’s top sugar barons), bought Casa and opened it to paying guests. Without compromising the feeling of exclusivity, they’ve developed it into one of the most complete resorts in the region.
Casa de Campo’s golf has been internationally recognized for more than three decades. Golf architects Pete and Alice Dye have had a home at Casa de Campo since the early 1970s, when they guided 300 local laborers with machetes to blaze the "Diente del Perro", (Teeth of the Dog, opened in 1971) through the jungle and along a rocky coast. The world's golfers flocked to the course after it served as a backdrop for the 1971 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. It remains the only Caribbean course consistently in the world’s top 100 courses (usually top 50). The Links Course (opened in 1974) and the members-only La Romana Country Club (opened in 1990) are inland layouts spiced with lakes. Dye’s newest course, the much-acclaimed Dye Fore (opened in 2000), skirts cliffs above the Chavón River, with views of the village of Altos de Chavón, distant mountains and the new marina. Dye recently completed another course on the plateau next to Dye Fore, called the Dye Fore Lakes.
In addition to being considered one of the most prestigious resorts in the Dominican Republic, Casa de Campo also boasts over 1,700 private villas, which range in price from US$500,000 to US$24,000,000, making it also one of the countries' most affluent communities, comparable to the Hamptons. 
Completed in 2000, Casa de Campo has a modern, 400-berth marina, complete with a shipyard with a 120-ton TraveLift designed by Italian architect, Gian Franco Fini to resemble Portofino. Surrounding this harbor are over 70 restaurants, shops, bars, and homes. In 2010, the Casa de Campo Marina played host to the prestigious Rolex Farr 40 sailing cup.
Casa de Campo served as the backdrop for the 1987 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

<doc id="18663943" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18663943" title="Panabas">
Panabas

The Panabas is a large, forward-curved sword, used by certain ethnic groups in the southern Philippines. It can range in size from 2 to 4 feet and can be held with one or both hands, delivering a deep, meat cleaver-like cut. In its heyday, it was used as a combat weapon, as an execution tool, and as a display of power. Occasional use as an agricultural and butchering tool has also been noted.
The sword's name is a shortening of the word ""pang-tabas"", which means "chopping tool". As such, its etymological origins are the root word "tabas" ("to chop off") and the prefix "pang" ("used for").
Appearance.
Easily one of the most recognizable among Filipino blade weapons, the Panabas is distinguished by its size and its unique, forward-curving profile. At 2 to 4 feet, it is among the largest of Filipino swords, with only some Kampilan specimens being longer. The forward-curved shape of its blade makes it unique not only in terms of its appearance, but in terms of handling as well. In terms of shape, similarities have been noted between the Panabas and the Nepalese Kukri knife, although the Kukri is, of course, much smaller. Its hilt is perhaps the longest among Filipino swords, both in terms of overall length, and in terms of proportion relative to the blade.
Blade.
Seen from the side, the Panabas' laminated steel blade is single-edged, is narrowest near the hilt, and gets dramatically thicker near the tip, where the edge side of the weapon curves forward.
Because the Panabas is primarily used in a chopping rather than thrusting motion, the shape of the actual tip varies greatly, with some specimens coming to a blunt tip, some pointed in the manner of other Filipino swords such as the Dahong Palay, and some taking on a square or diamond shape, with the furthest tip of the diamond, on the blunt back of the sword, serving as an elementary spike. There are rare Panabas specimens that have an “S” shaped blade sharpened partially along the backside, such that the specimen is double edged at the tip.
While design work on the Panabas' blade is relatively rare, among the most common examples of decorative design elements take the form of talismanic “X” along the spine.
Observed cross-sectionally, the blade is also thicker at its base, with a typical example being about 2 cm thick - so designed in order to withstand the massive forces that the Panabas both deals out and absorbs with every blow.
Hilt.
The panabas' hilt, made of hardwood such as Narra and often wrapped in braided rattan, is perhaps the longest among Filipino swords, both in terms of overall length, and in terms of proportion relative to the blade. The hilts of some specimens are wrapped in metal bands rather than rattan.
Scabbard.
Panabas scabbards were made of plain wood and are now extremely rare - according to accounts, largely because warriors would frequently discard them prior to a battle. Such scabbards invariably consist of two pieces of wood which are taken apart to remove the sword, as opposed to the sheath-type scabbards used by most other swords. The weapons are also said to have been carried into battle wrapped in cloth and slung across the back.
Usage.
Weapon.
While the Panabas is now rare and there are thus no contemporary cases of its use in battle, stories from and prior to the American colonial era describe it as being used for mop-up operations. It is said that warriors wielding Panabas would form a rear guard and, following in the steps of warriors in front, use the panabas to quickly dispatch any survivors. In terms of its function as a weapon, similarities have been noted between the Panabas and the western battle-axe.
Execution tool.
Because of its effectiveness at chopping through meat, Panabas was known favored for use in executions. As such, the panabas also came to symbolize a datu's power - a demonstration of his ability to control violence.
Domestic use.
The function of the Panabas is really that of a large cleaver, and this shapes the domestic use of the Panabas as much as it shapes the martial use. The noted use of the panabas as an execution tool sprang from its initial domestic use for cleaving meat and fish, easily chopping through the large tuna that are caught in the seas of the Southern Philippines. However, its main domestic use is that of clearing unusually dense vegetation.
Karit.
Used as a broader term, the word panabas means "a chopper" - a description which would include the many machete-like sword variants in the Philippines, and, perhaps more notably, the sickle. In portions of the Philippines where the Panabas is not used, the term panabas is used to refer to the sickle, whose proper name is "karit." It should thus be noted that the panabas and the karit are completely different tools. A weaponized version of the agricultural scythe would be the Indonesian kerambit.
In popular culture.
The Panabas is one of many bladed weapons portrayed in the "Weapons of Moroland" plaque that has become a common souvenir item and pop culture icon in the Philippines.

<doc id="18664006" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18664006" title="Youth exclusion">
Youth exclusion

Youth exclusion is a form of social exclusion in which youth are situated at a social disadvantage in joining institutions and organizations in their societies. Youth exclusion is context specific, meaning that, for example, “applying the concept of social exclusion to the Middle Eastern and North African countries calls for analysis of what it means to be Egyptian, Moroccan, Iranian, or Syrian, to be a Muslim, an Arab, and so on”. It is also relational in that social exclusion contains two parties, the excluders and excluded. Pertaining to youth exclusion, the excluders are often older generations who may feel that they risk their position in society by providing greater access of services and institutions to youth. It is also multi-dimensional, including not only poverty but “with other forms of social disadvantage or group memberships that are related to economic outcomes.”
The costs of youth exclusion may be measured in terms of the costs of aggregate components, including factors like youth unemployment and teen pregnancy, or a single aspect, such as youth crime or drug use.
Regional youth exclusion.
In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), youth exclusion has several dimensions. As in other regions, youth unemployment is high, with a regional average of 25% unemployment among 15- to 24-year-olds, which reaches as high as 37% in Morocco and up to 73% in Syria. There is also a significant level of labor market segmentation related to economic restructuring and insider-outsider issues;
“Organized insiders with seniority benefit from rents – higher wages, better benefits, and greater tenure – by monopolizing jobs and restricting access to particular sectors. Outsiders, such as youth and new labor market entrants, suffer from longer unemployment durations, skill atrophy, and declining health, as well as the social dimensions of exclusion from work.” Additionally, youth exclusion is exacerbated by gender, whether due to child-rearing needs and expectations, sex segregation, parental supervision, or other cultural or religious reasons. For example, compared to 63% of economically active 15- to 29-year-old males, only 22% of females from the same age group were economically active in Egypt in 2006.
As a result of youth unemployment, young people have a tendency of extending their education and delaying marriage and family formation. Like Europe, MENA has seen its youth delay leaving the home, getting married, and beginning families.
Consequences of youth exclusion in MENA have included young people entering waithood, a period during which they simply wait for their lives to begin, most notably by queuing for long periods of unemployment during which they live with parents and are financially unable to pursue marriage or home ownership. While delayed marriage is a trend seen in many societies, adaptations vary, such that it is normal in the United States and Europe for young unmarried couples to cohabitate while in MENA, such an arrangement is unacceptable. Instead, an increasing number of youths are engaging in nikah urfi, temporary marriages, which offer little security to the wife and any subsequent offspring. The psychological impact is also considerable, with unemployment leading to depression and social isolation, often with physical manifestations. There is considerable concern in the international community that these isolated youths are marketed to by extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda, who prey upon their sense of social exclusion and hopelessness.

Stonewall Kitchen

Stonewall Kitchen is a creator of high-quality, specialty food products. Their product line ranges from jams and jellies to grill sauces and mustards.
History.
Starting in 1991, partners Jonathan King and Jim Stott combined their interests in horticulture and cooking to create recipes for oils, jams, chutneys and more. At the urging of a friend, they began their business by selling their homemade products at the local farmers’ market. Working from a small folding table and calling themselves Stonewall Kitchen, after the historic New England stone walls visible outside their kitchen window, the two ended up selling every product they brought with them.
Able to repeat their success at farmers’ markets and other local venues, Jonathan and Jim expanded their product line to include new kinds of vinegars, oils, pesto, jams and baked goods. At one event, a local business owner asked if they sold wholesale. Not knowing exactly what she meant, Jonathan and Jim ended up selling every jar before the market even opened. And with that, a new revenue stream emerged.
In 1993, demand for Stonewall Kitchen products was growing. National retailer Crate & Barrel approached Jonathan and Jim with an order for 2500 jars of their Orange Cranberry Marmalade. The order was filled but it took a month for the two of them to do it. Realizing they needed to increase production capacity, they purchased and renovated an eighteenth-century era barn in Kittery, Maine. Though adequate, when another larger property became available in nearby York, Maine, the two purchased it and opened a new center of operations.
As production became more structured and streamlined, Jonathan and Jim attended the Fancy Food Show in New York City – the largest specialty food and beverage marketplace that attracts 1,100 exhibitors and 36,000 buyers. The result was unprecedented for first time attendees—the Outstanding Preserve award for their Roasted Garlic Onion Jam. They also earned a second highest honor award, for Outstanding Product Line. By the time the show was over, Jonathan and Jim had 500 orders from retailers across the country.
By 1999, Stonewall Kitchen's momentum required a new and bigger facility. With support from the local community, Jonathan and Jim purchased an eight-acre parcel of town-owned land in York, ME and built a 46,000 square-foot headquarters. The building still serves as a manufacturing facility, distribution and fulfillment operation and the headquarters.
A casual breakfast and lunch bistro called the Stonewall Kitchen Cafe was added to this facility in 2003. This eatery offers specially prepared-fresh food from talented chefs who use the finest ingredients to create a variety of Stonewall Kitchen signature menu items.
Another expansion took place in 2008 when a new 32-seat, theater-style, Cooking School was added to the York facility. This state-of-the-art classroom is designed for cooks of all skill levels. Restaurant chefs, cookbook authors and cooking professionals from across the nation come here to share their knowledge and demonstrate their talents. Class attendees observe, can ask questions and are then served a full course meal.
Products.
Since their beginnings, Stonewall Kitchen has expanded beyond jams, which they are still primarily known for. Their product line now includes grille sauces, mustards, chutneys, pancake mixes and dessert sauces, as well as kitchen tools and place settings and home decor items.
In 2006, Stonewall Kitchen launched the Barefoot Contessa Pantry line in conjunction with Ina Garten, chef best known as the host of "Barefoot Contessa" on Food Network. This partnership ended in 2011.

Awards.
The product line continues to be one of the most awarded in the industry. Since 1995, Stonewall Kitchen has received 28 prestigious awards from the Specialty Food Association and has been awarded the coveted Outstanding Product Line Honors three times.
Charitable Giving.
As longtime residents and active contributors to the local community, Jonathan King and Jim Stott often credit their success to the support they received from that first farmers' market, the town of York, Maine and the surrounding seacoast business community.
The company's charitable giving generally focuses on serving the needs of local communities, children in crisis, cancer prevention, education and prevention of the AIDS virus, as well as environmental programs.
From 2004 to 2013, Stonewall Kitchen donated over one million dollars to charitable organizations. The company also donates over a hundred gift baskets for local fund raising annually.
Currently, Stonewall Kitchen commits its support to the work of a handful of partner nonprofits through financial grants.

Quarry Falls

Quarry Falls is a 6 metre high horsetail ribbon waterfall found on private property (private without permission to access) in Flamborough, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It was "discovered" by "Joe Hollick" and "Montfield Christian" (formerly of the Hamilton Conservation Authority) when the two of them were out to do measurements and take GPS readings on some other waterfalls in the area in the spring of 2006.
Nearby attractions include the Bruce Trail, Smokey Hollow Resource Management Area, Rock Chapel Sanctuary, Borer's Falls, Rock Chapel Golf Course, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. 
"Upper Quarry Cascade" is 4 metres in height and is found just northeast of Quarry Falls near the Bruce Trail. A wooden bridge for the Bruce Trail crosses over the crest of this cascade.
Directions.

Exposition Park Rose Garden

The Exposition Park Rose Garden is a historic sunken garden located in Exposition Park in Los Angeles, California. It has been called "one of the city's best-kept secrets". It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
Establishment of the rose garden.
From 1871 to 1911, the site of the rose garden was part of the city's Agricultural Park. The rose garden area was then used for horse, camel, dog, and later automobile racing; it also reportedly housed the city's longest bar and "one of its most stylish brothels." In 1914, the city announced plans to construct a wildflower garden at the park, but the rose garden was not built until 1927 with the planting of 15,000 bushes of more than 100 varieties. When the garden was announced, the "Los Angeles Times" applauded the project: "No more fitting tribute could be paid to the spirit of Southern California than to erect in the center of her largest city the greatest rose garden in the world." During the Great Depression, the lack of funding threatened the closure of the rose garden, then described as "the largest rose garden in the world."
Boldsen statues.
In 1936, four large marble statues by Danish sculptor Thyra Boldsen were installed on pedestals at the four corners of the garden. The statues were titled "Nymph Finding Pipes of Pan," "The Blessing" (dedicated to the mothers of the world), "The Start" (awarded first prize by the Danish Academy of Fine Arts), and "Terpsichore" (or "Melody of Life"). The sculptor explained her intent with the statues this way: "In conceiving and executing these four figures dedicated to womanhood and motherhood, I have had in mind that men for centuries have erected statues symbolizing bravery—these symbolize love, life and joy."
Popularity of the Rose Garden.
In the 1950s, the annual pruning demonstration drew thousands of rose enthusiasts to the park. By the mid-1980s, the garden had more than 20,000 rose bushes and more than 200 varieties of roses. The All-America Rose Selection, a rose growers organization, began donating its Rose of the Year to the garden in 1940. The garden is reportedly visited by more than a million people a year and is a popular location for weddings, reflection, and other events. The garden also has four gazebos, several statues, and a central fountain. The garden is located adjacent to the University of Southern California campus, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and the California Science Center.
Threat to the Rose Garden and historic designation.
In 1986, plans to dig up the garden to build an underground parking garage led to protests in the media. The "Los Angeles Times" ran an editorial opposing the plan: "There are times when the leaders of Los Angeles seem perversely intent on living up to the image that many outsiders have of them—insensitive and uncouth rabbits who would, say, dig up a garden to put in a parking lot." The garden had also been threatened by an earlier proposal by the Los Angeles Raiders football team to convert the garden into a practice field for the team. In order to protect the garden from such threats, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
Film and television.
The exterior of the Old Armory Building, abutting the eastern edge of the Rose Garden, is used in establishing shots of the fictional Jeffersonian Center, in the TV series "Bones".

Kulyagash

The Kulyagash (name originates from the Mari language; or ; , "Kulyagash, Kuligash, Kulegash, Kulyagesh") is the biggest wetland in Tatarstan, Russian Federation. It consists of Kulyagash swamp and several lakes. It is situated in Belaya and Ik Rivers interfluvial, Aktanyshsky District, at the east of Tatarstan, near the border with Bashkortostan. The area of the wetland is estimated as 22,000 ha. Kulyagash stretches from west to east , from north to south . The most notable lakes in the wetland are Atyr, Kinder-Kul, Azybeyevskoye, Syulyale-Kul, the biggest being, however elongate Kulyagash Lake. There are forests at the several islands in the swamp.
Ecology.
Since 1978 it is endanged by Nizhnekamsk Reservoir, which is now at 62 meters above sea level, but it is planned to fill it up to 68 to flood Kulyagash totally.
The wetland was formed by meandering Ik and Belaya. Several species of plants, such as Andromeda polifolia, Scheuchzeria palustrus, Oxicoccus palustrus, Eriophoeum vaginatum, Salix myrtilloides, mentioned in the local Red Book, as well as rare Najas major, Nymphaea alba, Nuphar pumila, Leersia oryzoides, Calamagrostis neglecta, C.phragmitoides, Ligularia sibirica and Betula humilis inhabit the area. Kulyagash is proposed to be included to Ramsar sites in Russia.
In 2001 the district government proposed the creation of "Kulyagash" reserve there, and in 2004 Tatarstan ministry of ecology promised to establish reserve there.
However, in 2008 it was decided to fill the reservoir up to 68 m.
Economy.
Swamp's surface area, covered with peat is 4897 ha, 2774 of them are ultimate reserves. The mean thickness of peat is 1.32 m (the maximum is 4.5 m), total volume of peat is 36,624,000 m³.
Human history.
The archaeological excavations revealed scents of Bronze Age peoples in Kulyagash. Prior the 14th century the area was populated by Finno-Ugric peoples, but then was populated by Volga Bulgars and other Turkic peoples, developed to the modern Tatars and Bashkirs. Since late 16th century is also a home of the Eastern Mari and Russians. In the 19th century Derbeshkinsky settlement was founded at the north of the wetland. There were dockyards for the Kama river ships, until the settlement, as well as several surrounding villages was flooded in 1980s by reservoir.

Pailadzo Captanian

Pailadzo Captanian was a survivor of the Armenian Genocide and an author. She is also credited with inspiring the creation of Rice-A-Roni which is based on her own recipe of Armenian pilaf. 
During the Armenian Genocide in 1915, Pailadzo, while pregnant, was forced to march through the Syrian desert to Aleppo. 
After the Genocide, she wrote her memoirs in French, titled "Memoires d'une deportee". In 1919, the memoirs were published and are considered important contribution to Armenian Genocide research, since it was penned shortly after the events. The book contributed to Raphael Lemkin's research and his understanding of the Genocide. 
Also in 1919, Mrs. Captanian was reunited with her two other sons whom she had entrusted to a Greek family before the deportations. Afterwards, Pailadzo and her sons moved to the United States, where she worked as a seamstress and sewed draperies for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, New York.
After World War II, Pailadzo and her family moved to San Francisco. While in San Francisco, she rented a room to Lois and Tom DeDomenico. Pailadzo taught Lois how to make Armenian pilaf and in 1955 Tom and his brother Vincent, who worked at the Golden Grain Macaroni pasta company founded by their father, came up with the initial recipe for the rice-and-macaroni mixture called Rice-A-Roni.

Bobby McNeal

Robert "Bobby" McNeal (19 January 1891 – 12 May 1956) was an English footballer who played as a left-half. Despite his career running through World War I he managed nearly 400 appearances in the Football League for West Bromwich Albion, playing in some of the most successful seasons in the club's history. He won the Second Division (1910–11), First Division (1919–20), and Charity Shield (1920), and played in the 1912 FA Cup Final.
Club career.
McNeal was born in Hobson, County Durham, where he played football for the village team before he turned professional with West Bromwich Albion in June 1910. In his first full season he helped the club to the Second Division title. The "Throstles" then finished ninth in the First Division in 1911–12. He also won a runners-up medal in the 1912 FA Cup Final when Albion lost 1–0 to Barnsley in a replay at Bramall Lane. Albion went on to post top ten finishes in the league in 1912–13, 1913–14, and 1914–15, before the Football League was suspended due to World War I.
During the war he appeared as a guest player for Fulham, Middlesbrough, Notts County and Port Vale. McNeal was part of West Bromwich Albion's league championship-winning side of 1919–20. The team also won the 1920 Charity Shield with a 2–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Albion then dropped to 14th and 13th place finishes in 1920–21 and 1921–22. They finished seventh in 1922–23 and 16th in 1923–24, before posting a second place finish in 1924–25 – they ended the campaign just two points behind champions Huddersfield Town. In May 1925, McNeal retired through injury and became a licensee of a pub in the West Bromwich area. From 1926 to 1927, McNeal served as Albion's coach on a part-time basis.
International career.
McNeal earned two England caps during the 1914 British Home Championship, playing the two final England internationals before the onset of World War I, which caused the suspension of the competition until 1920. He was one of four England players to win their first cap on 16 March 1914 as Wales were defeated 2–0 at Ninian Park. His second and final cap came on 14 April as Scotland ran out 3–1 winners at Hampden Park. Overall the competition was something of a minor embarrassment for the country, as the Irish finished as champions and England finished third behind the Scots and just one point ahead of the Welsh.

Miguelón

Miguelón (considered to be 400,000 years old) is the popular nickname for the most complete skull of an "Homo heidelbergensis" ever found. More than 5,500 human fossils of this species, which are considered to be the direct ancestor of Homo neanderthalensis, have been found in the Sima de los Huesos (The pit of bones) site in the Sierra de Atapuerca in northern Spain. 
The excavators suggest that this concentration of bones in the pit may represent the practice of burial by the inhabitants of the cave. A competing theory cites the lack of small bones in the assemblage and suggests that the remains were washed into the pit by natural agents.
Miguelón, around thirty years old, had 13 impacts in the head and died of septicemia resulting from broken teeth. In his upper left jaw there is an important bone alteration, with evidence of alveolar infection. According to Arsuaga, a tooth had been broken in life by a strong blow, so that the flesh had been exposed and led to an infectious process that continued until nearly the orbital bone. The cranial capacity is around 1100cc.
The nickname "Miguelón" was derived from Miguel Indurain, a retired Spanish road racing cyclist that won the Tour and Giro in 1992, the year in which this skull was discovered.

Lucky Debonair

Lucky Debonair (May 2, 1962 - 1987) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 1965 Kentucky Derby. He was bred by owners Dan and Ada Rice of Wheaton, Illinois at their Danada Farm satellite operation on Old Frankfort Pike near Lexington, Kentucky, a property that once was part of the Idle Hour Stock Farm. Lucky Debonair was sired by Vertex and out of the mare Fresh as Fresh, who was a daughter of the 1943 U.S. Triple Crown Champion Count Fleet.
Conditioned for racing by trainer Frank Catrone, as a two-year-old in 1964, Lucky Debonair made one start at the Atlantic City Race Course, where he finished out of the money. Sent to race in California at age three, the unheralded colt was ridden by Bill Shoemaker. He finished second in the San Felipe Stakes and won the San Vicente Handicap, both at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia. He was a supplementary entrant in the West Coast's most important race for three-year-olds, the Santa Anita Derby. Under Shoemaker, Lucky Debonair won the race by four lengths and set a new stakes record of 1:47.00, a time that as of 2008 has been equaled but not broken. He followed this victory with another very important win in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Race Course and was made the second choice among bettors for the Kentucky Derby.
1965 Kentucky Derby.
Lucky Debonair gave Shoemaker his third Derby win by defeating ten other top three-year-olds, including the heavily favored American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1964 Bold Lad (10th), the brilliantly fast Ogden Phipps colt Dapper Dan (2nd), future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Tom Rolfe (3rd), and Hail To All (5th). For In the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes, a bruised ankle that almost caused him to be withdrawn from the race contributed to Lucky Debonair finishing seventh. The colt did not run in the Belmont Stakes.
Healthy, Lucky Debonair returned to racing at age four in 1966. He won three of five starts, including a win over Native Diver in California's prestigious Santa Anita Handicap. Retired to stud duty at the Rices' farm in Kentucky, he produced fifteen stakes winners there and in Venezuela, where he was sent in 1976 when the then-widowed Ada Rice disbanded her racing stable.
Lucky Debonair died of old age in 1987 at age twenty-five. On May 4, 2002, the city of Wheaton, Illinois honored him with a plaque and memorial rock at the Danada Equestrian Center.

<doc id="18664114" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18664114" title="Zone of polarizing activity">
Zone of polarizing activity

The Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA) is an area of mesenchyme that contains signals which instruct the developing limb bud to form along the anterior/posterior axis. Limb bud is undifferentiated mesenchyme enclosed by an ectoderm covering. Eventually, the limb bud develops into bones, tendons, muscles and joints. Limb bud development relies not only on the zone of polarizing activity, but also many different genes, signals, and a unique region of ectoderm called the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Research by Saunders and Gasseling in 1948 identified the AER and its subsequent involvement in proximal distal outgrowth. Twenty years later, the same group did transplantation studies in chick limb bud and identified the ZPA. It wasn’t until 1987 that Todt and Fallon showed that the AER and ZPA are dependent on each other.
Patterning.
Patterning along the limb bud requires signals from many sources. Specifically, proteins called transcription factors (TF) help control the rate at which a gene is transcribed. The limb bud expresses a TF called ALX4 at the anterior part of the mesoderm, with the TF HOXB8 being expressed at the posterior portion. The Alx4 region, the medial region, and the Hox8 expressing area meet at a proximal area where the AER develops. The ZPA forms where the Hox8 region joins the AER. 
These regions are dependent on signaling in order for the appropriate induction events to occur. The AER expresses FGF8 which induces Shh expression in the posterior mesoderm. Shh then stimulates FGF4 to be expressed in the posterior part of the AER. After these events, there is a co-dependence between FGF-4 and Shh for their subsequent expression and maintenance. Additionally, Wnt7a is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm, is needed to maintain the FGF and Shh signaling.
Apical Ectodermal Ridge.
Sauders and Gasseling published data in the Journal of Experimental Biology in 1948, showing that reference marks inserted near the rim of the apical border of the wing bud are dispersed throughout the whole forearm of the wing. This led them to believe that the apical ectoderm may play a role in forming parts of the wing. To test this, they removed apical ectoderm from wing buds which yielded deformed wings. When they removed dorsal ectoderm, normal wings formed. These results showed that the cells of the apical ectoderm have a precise fate to form specific regions of the wing. 
Sonic Hedgehog.
In 1968, Saunders and Gasseling did transplantation studies using tissue from chick limb bud. Removing cells from the posterior region of the limb, they transplanted them to the anterior region and noticed that extra digits formed in the anterior area and these digits were mirror images to the normal ones. This posterior mesenchyme was the ZPA, which is now known to express Shh. One hypothesis is that at high concentrations, this unknown morphogen causes mesenchyme to form on the posterior side, while low concentrations induces meshenchyme to form on the anterior end. Identifying this morphogen was the next crucial step. 
The first hypothesis came from Tickle et al. who showed that when retinoic acid is placed in the anterior margin of the limb bud, mirror image duplications result. However, concentrations of retinoic acid that cause mirror image duplications induce high levels of a downstream gene, retinoic acid receptor Beta, which is not seen in the posterior region. It is now known that endogenous retinoic acid acts permissively prior to limb bud initiation to allow the budding process to begin, and that the specific morphogen, hypothesized to be Shh, is normally expressed independently of retinoic acid in the posterior region of the limb bud. By looking at signaling homologs of other organisms, the segmentation gene of Drosophila, hedgehog, served as a viable candidate.
The idea that Shh is required for proper ZPA signaling and anterior/posterior limb formation needed to be tested. Riddle et al. took Saunders and Gasselings findings to the next step and proved that Shh is the morphogen within the ZPA that is required for anterior posterior patterning. By isolating the Shh gene and implanting it into the anterior limb bud, mirror image digit duplications formed.
Isolation was conducted by designing PCR primers that correspond to sequences of Shh that are conserved in drosophila and mouse and involved in limb bud formation. The clone was then used as a template to screen a cDNA library from stage 22 limb bud RNA. The group ectopically expressed the gene by taking advantage of a retroviral vector to insert the cDNA into chick cells. There are unique types of this retroviral vector that only infect specific strains of avian species. Therefore, this group used a retroviral vector termed RCAS-E, which lacks a type E envelope protein, and is able to infect certain chick embryo fibroblasts with Shh. 
Results showed digit duplications, with the most common being 4-3-3-4, with digit 2 missing. Though there was variability, it was clearly consistent with anterior to posterior positional patterning. Variations were due to the amount of tissue grafted, and the location of the graft. These findings indicate that Shh could substitute for the function of the ZPA. Thus Shh is sufficient for ZPA action.
Mediators of Sonic Hedgehog.
Shh may be a critical signal regulating ZPA function, but the genes involved in Shh signaling are under the control of several other factors that are needed for ZPA maintenance and function including Hand2 and Hoxb-8. Retinoic acid, an important signaling molecule needed throughout embryogenesis, acts through the Hox genes. It was originally postulated that retinoic acid acts to induce the Hoxb-8 gene, but this hypothesis has not been supported by genetic studies in mouse embryos lacking retinoic acid synthesis that still express Hoxb-8 in the limb. Hoxb-8 signaling is active in the early embryo, beginning at the posterior end of the lateral plate mesoderm and extending to the anterior region. As Hoxb-8 spreads to more anterior regions, Shh is induced in the area that will become the ZPA. Shh is only induced in the anterior region because of signals from the AER. Experiments done by Heikinheimo et al. show that when the AER is removed, beads that express FGF are sufficient to induce Shh signaling in the ZPA. Thus, the likely signaling factor from the AER is FGF. 
Additionally when the AER is removed, Shh is no longer expressed, and the ZPA can no longer be maintained. Acting in a positive feedback mechanism, FGF-4 is expressed near the ZPA. FGF-4 acts to maintain Shh expression, while Shh acts to maintain FGF-4 expression. At the same time, Wnt-7a is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm, and provides further positive feedback to FGF-4 and Shh. Without this system, limbs and digits are either significantly reduced or missing.
Sonic Hedgehog Downstream Signals.
The downstream targets that are activated in response to Shh pose another challenge. Genes that are targets of Shh signaling encode factors that lead to the formation of the autopod, stylopod and zeugopod. 
Activation of Gli zinc-finger transcription factors occurs through the Hedgehog signaling pathway. There are three Gli factors that are essential for limb development: Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. Without Shh, Gli2 and Gli3 are processed to a repressor form and travel to the nucleus to repress the Shh response. But when Shh is present, unprocessed Gli2 and Gli3 are able to pass into the nucleus and stimulate expression of Shh target genes, including Gli1. Studies in mice show that Gli3 knockouts have polydactyly digits. Fundamentally, Shh acts to remove repression of Gli3. When Shh diffuses from the ZPA, it predominates in the posterior region of the limb bud, activating Gli3 in the posterior region, while the repressor is still active in the anterior region. This leads to activation of other genes such as Hox genes, FGF genes and BMP genes in the posterior region, setting up digit patterning. BMP, plays a role in limb morphology, specifically, digit positioning, but the specific regulation of BMP is unclear. 
In particular, the Hox genes A and D are likely to be controlled by Shh within the ZPA. Three phases of activation of the Hox genes results in patterning of the limb parallel to the expression of the Hox genes in a nested pattern. Activation of these genes results in a new limb axis that ultimately results in digit development, possibly interpreting gene expression to assign digit identity. Overall, the molecular ZPA requires input for several signaling centers, but acts as an organizer itself, inducing anterior-posterior pattering of the chick limb bud.

Reginald "Reggie" Arthur Gibbs (7 May 1882 - 28 November 1938) was a Welsh international rugby union wing who played club rugby for Penarth and Cardiff. He was capped 16 times for his country and captained his team on one occasion. Gibbs is one of five Welsh players to have scored four tries in a single game.
International career.
Gibbs was first capped for his country in a game against Scotland on February 3, 1906. Wales won the game 9-3, but were completely outplayed by Scotland; the main reason for the Scottish defeat was Gibbs impressive display as a 'rover'. His work with Billy Trew turned the minimal possession Wales had into the three tries the team scored on the day.
In total Gibbs scored 17 tries for his country, establishing a Welsh record which stood until Gareth Edwards broke it in 1976. In his final season, 1911, Gibbs scored five tries as Wales won the Triple Crown and Grand Slam, their last such success for 39 years. He captained Wales once, against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in 1910, scoring a try and leading Wales to 19-3 victory. Gibbs toured Australasia as part of the Arthur Harding's Anglo-Welsh team of 1908. In the 1908 tour, Gibbs played two of the tests and scored the only try for the tourists in the first test.

Camborne Grammar School

Camborne Grammar School in Camborne, Cornwall, was a girls' grammar school between 1908 and 1976.
Origins.
In 1877 Redbrooke College for young ladies was founded at Redbrooke House on Camborne Hill. There were about 20 boarders and also day girls. There were three teachers at first and later a Miss Chudleigh came from Liskeard to be headmistress until 1896 when Miss Kay took charge. In 1897 Miss Pratt of Girton College, Cambridge took over the role.
With the 1904 Education Act, state secondary education was planned for a limited number of pupils. Redbrooke College became Redbrooke County School and the number of pupils increased so that it was necessary to transfer to a new larger building at the bottom of Camborne Hill, (Trevu Road).
History.
The new premises were officially opened in 1908 as Camborne Grammar School and were built to accommodate pupils from the Camborne-Redruth area, extending from Gwithian in the west to St. Agnes in the east and south to villages such as St Day and Troon. (Boys from this same area attended Redruth Grammar School). 
The first headmistress of Camborne Grammar School was Miss Pratt and up until the 1930s the number of pupils increased. In 1933 Miss Evans became headmistress and during the depression years the numbers attending the school decreased. In 1935 Mr C.V.Thomas, chairman of the governors presented the school with a new gym and Camborne was the first grammar school in Cornwall to have a purpose built gym. 
During the Second World War the pupils and staff of Paddington and Maida Vale school shared the premises for some time and at this time biology was the only science subject taught due to lack of staff. Even after the war there was still rationing of food and school dinners and milk were said to be welcome.
With the Education Act of 1944 the kindergarten and preparatory department were closed and there were no more fee payers in the school. Also in 1944 the Eleven plus exam scheme for entry to the Grammar school was introduced. In 1947 Miss Evans retired and Miss Bain from Edinburgh University became headmistress.
In the 1950s the school premises became too small for the greater number of pupils and in 1954 a new block was built in the school grounds. Miss Bain left in 1967 when Mrs. Bannister became headmistress until 1971 when numbers had increased by 33%. Mrs Mostyn took over in 1971 when it became necessary to look elsewhere for extra classrooms. The first outpost was the nearby St. Johns Catholic School and the second outpost was the Camborne Community Centre.
In 1975 the sixth form was moved to a new centre at Treswithian School, Camborne and due to the introduction of the comprehensive system, at the end of the 1976 summer term the rest of the school followed to this site.
Later history.
The school building later became home to the Basset Junior School under headmaster Mr Treneer and, from 1980, also the site of Beacon Infants School, under headmistress Mrs Gratton-Kane. These later became merged and renamed Trevithick County Primary until 1997, in which the school moved to a new building further down the road. Today the school premises are known as the 'Trevu Children's Centre' for pre-school children and early learning which provides a toy library, various health services, a nursery and crèche, a cafe, and access to training and development for parents and carers.
In June 2009 Cornwall County Council put the building up for sale as a site for development. Not only does this mean that Children's services and facilities face closure in September 2009, but potentially the building could be demolished to redevelop the site. Local parents have formed a campaign group to try to force the Council to reconsider their actions.
Zoe Fox, spokesperson for Cornish political party Mebyon Kernow and local campaigner, has condemned the proposed closure of the Children's Centre at Trevu in Camborne. She said, "“It is a scandal that Trevu Childrens’ Centre is under threat and the building is scheduled to be sold off for soulless residential redevelopment. The facilities at Trevu are first class and incredibly well used. The proposed dispersal of these services will impact badly on many families. The Centre gives heart to our community and is the best possible use of our heritage. It gives local people the chance to enjoy a beautiful old building with services available on one site including a sensory playground, cafe, toy library, day care and after school clubs catering from nursery to teens as well as support for families. It is a community hub and a valuable resource particularly for isolated young families. Just because the site is valuable is not a reason to sell it off and disperse the services.""

The Wind in the Willows (band)

The Wind in the Willows was an American band which included Deborah Harry as a back-up vocalist. The band took its name from British writer Kenneth Grahame's, "The Wind in the Willows", a classic of children's literature.
The band's only album, the self-titled "The Wind in the Willows" (1968, Capitol Records LP2956), grazed the charts at #195. The band broke up shortly after failing to achieve commercial success or critical acclaim. Harry subsequently achieved fame and success fronting the New Wave band Blondie which she founded in 1974 after leaving another band, The Stilettos.
Wind in the Willows recorded a second album which was never released. The whereabouts of the tapes are unknown. According to Cathay Che's biography on Harry, it has never surfaced, but Harry was said to have contributed more vocals than on the first album, as well as writing lyrics for a track entitled "Buried Treasure".

Twiddly bits

Twiddly Bits is an English slang term. From the word twiddly (sometimes spelled Twiddley); curly or decorative, esp. in an unnecessary way and bit; a small piece or amount of something, a twiddly bit is anything that is relatively small and trifling or elaborately decorative. Twiddly is a word commonly used in British English, as in Roald Dahl’s "The BFG", where the giant’s large ears allow him to "hear absolutely every single twiddly little thing". The term twiddly bit is applicable in almost any context and is commonly used to describe aspects of architecture, art, music, literature, fashion, etc.
Music.
The term "Twiddly Bits" is commonly used in the music industry to describe a short improvised part that is technically advanced and/or musically interesting. In music, a Twiddly Bit is similar to a solo though it is typically shorter and lacks the structure typical of a solo, that is to say a beginning, middle and end. Rather it is short and sweet and can serve to fill space, act as a turnaround between parts, or as a substitute for a solo where a musician wants to show off but time does not allow for a full solo.
There is also a Victorian era parlour song called "Twiddley Bits" recorded by Sheila Steafel on the album "Victoria Plums". It is about a woman taking music lessons.
MIDI Library.
Twiddly.Bits is a brand of MIDI phrases developed in 1993 by Keyfax, a company co-founded by keyboardist Julian Colbeck and Dave Spiers; the name suggested by fellow British prog rock keyboardist, Dave Stewart. 
Twiddly.Bits MIDI phrases derive their name from the slang, as they are literally short, 1-to-2-measure, technically advanced performances from professional studio musicians recorded as MIDI. The Twiddly.Bits MIDI library brand was originally conceived to make available to musicians and composers musical MIDI loops that could not be played on a standard MIDI keyboard controller due to the limitations of keyboards in duplicating instrument-specific nuances and timbres, such as a trill from a saxophone or a dynamic drum roll. The parts were recorded using the appropriate MIDI controller so these nuances and characteristics specific to the particular instrument in question would come through, making them the most authentic and realistic-sounding MIDI phrases available. They were the first of the MIDI loop brands and are offered in over 20 different volumes in different genres and musical styles. They are also a well recognised brand and have been used in thousands of commercial recordings and scores since their inception.

417th Bombardment Group

The 417th Bombardment Group is an inactive United States Army Air Forces unit. Its last assignment was with V Bomber Command at Itami Airfield, Japan, where it was inactivated on 5 November 1945.
During World War II, the group operated in the Southwest Pacific Theater as a light bombardment unit during the New Guinea and Philippines campaigns. It was awarded both the Distinguished Unit Citation and the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for its combat service.
History.
Training in the United States.
The 417th Bombardment Group was activated in the spring of 1943 at Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma with the 672d, 673d, 674th, and 675th Bombardment Squadrons assigned. The group drew its initial cadre from the 46th and 416th Bombardment Groups. Once assigned, the 417th's key personnel travelled to Orlando Army Air Base in mid-April where they received combat training from the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics.
The first Douglas A-20 Havocs arrived to equip the group in mid-May along with some DB-7 export models of the Havoc. Initial training of the group was conducted by the 46th Bombardment Group, the Operational Training Unit at Will Rogers Field. The group then moved to DeRidder Army Air Base, Louisiana for advanced training. From August to September the 417th operated with the II Tactical Air Division giving low level support to ground units on maneuvers. Once training was completed The 417th departed the San Francisco Port of Embarkation by ship on New Year's Day 1944.
Combat in the Southwest Pacific.
The group arrived in New Guinea in late January 1944, where it became part of Fifth Air Force. It began combat in March, operating in support of ground forces on New Guinea and striking airfields, bridges, personnel concentrations, installations, and shipping in the area. The group participated with other Fifth Air Force units in attacks on shipping and enemy airstrips near Hollandia on 16 April that resulted in the destruction of 298 enemy planes.
Most sorties were flown at low level, since Japanese flak was not very intense. During these low level bombing operations, it was found that there was little need for a bombardier. Consequently, the bombardier was often replaced by additional forward-firing machine guns mounted in a faired-over nose. The A-20's heavy firepower, maneuverability, speed and bombload made it an appropriate weapon for pinpoint strikes against aircraft, hangars, and supply dumps. In formation, their heavy forward firepower could defeat shipboard anti-aircraft defenses and at low level the A-20s could skip their bombs into the sides of transports and destroyers with deadly effect. Some A-20s had their heavy forward-firing armament supplemented by clusters of three Bazooka-type rocket tubes underneath each wing. These tubes each held an M8, T-30 spin-stabilized rocket. These rocket launcher tubes turned out to be heavy and complicated, and were generally more trouble than they were worth and were not often used.
The unit operated from Noemfoor from September to December 1944, attacking airfields and installations on Ceram, Halmahera, and western New Guinea. Noemfoor operations included attacks on oil installations. The 417th moved to the Philippines in December 1944 at the end of the New Guinea campaign. The group's ground crews left Noemfoor by ship while the aircrew flew to the Philippines once the advance party had prepared McGuire Field for use in late December. While en route, the convoy transporting the ground echelon endured two Japanese air attacks.
The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for attacking Japanese convoys at Lingayen between 30 December 1944 and 2 January 1945, an action that not only impaired enemy shipping and supply strength, but also helped to clear the way for the American invasion of Luzon. Unfortunately, during the 2 January attack, the group commander, Lt. Col. Howard S. Ellmore, was lost to enemy fire. During these attacks the group sank 36,000 tons of shipping including a freighter, a destroyer escort and several transports.
Until June 1945 the 417th supported ground forces and continued to attack enemy airfields, transportation, and installations on Luzon, Cebu, Negros, and Mindanao. The group flew its last missions in July, dropping propaganda leaflets to Japanese troops on Luzon. After the Philippines were secured, the group turned its attention to Japanese targets on Formosa in early 1945. It moved to Okinawa in August 1945 and to Itami Air Base, Japan in November, where it was inactivated on 15 November 1945.

Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's road race

The men's road race, a part of the cycling events at the 2008 Summer Olympics, took place on August 9 at the Urban Road Cycling Course in Beijing. It started at 11:00 China Standard Time (UTC+8), and was scheduled to last until 17:30 later that day. The course ran north across the heart of the Beijing metropolitan area, passing such landmarks as the Temple of Heaven, the Great Hall of the People, Tiananmen Square and the Beijing National Stadium. After rolling over relatively flat terrain for north of the Beijing city center, the route entered a decisive circuit encompassing seven loops on a section up and down the Badaling Pass, including ramps as steep as a 10 percent gradient.
The race was won by the Spanish rider Samuel Sánchez in 6 hours, 23 minutes, 49 seconds, after a six-man breakaway group contested a sprint finish. Davide Rebellin of Italy and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, finishing second and third place with the same time as Sánchez, received silver and bronze medals respectively for the event. The hot and humid conditions were in sharp contrast to the heavy rain weathered in the women's road race the following day.
The event was one of the earliest to be concluded at the 2008 Summer Olympics, taking place on the first day of competition. Concerns were raised before the Olympics about the threat of pollution in endurance sports, but no major problems were apparent in the race.
In April 2009, it was announced that Rebellin had tested positive for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA, a third-generation form of erythropoietin) during the Olympics. After his B-sample subsequently confirmed initial results, he returned his medal and repaid the prize money he had won from the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) while still maintaining his innocence. Cancellara and original fourth-place finisher Alexandr Kolobnev were later awarded new medals corresponding to their updated finishing positions.
Qualification.
Qualification for the race was restricted to five athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), providing that these athletes qualified through the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) rankings, with the UCI ProTour considered to be superior to the UCI Continental Circuits. The number of qualification places allocated varied among the different UCI tours, which all maintain their own ranking system. Any NOC unable to fill its quota of athletes from the ProTour was permitted to enter athletes from one of the continental tours, and if that was not feasible, from the "B" World Championship. The number of places allocated to each tour were thus (in descending order): 70 riders from the ProTour, 38 from the Europe tour, 15 from the America tour, nine from the Asia tour, five from the Africa tour, and three from the Oceania tour. Five entrants qualified through the "B" World Championships.
The final number of competitors was set to be 145, but only 143 athletes started the race. Four cyclists were scratched from the race shortly before it took place. Damiano Cunego of Italy had not yet recovered from the injuries he sustained in the 2008 Tour de France, so he was replaced by Vincenzo Nibali. Portugal's Sérgio Paulinho, the silver medalist at the 2004 event, was said to be in insufficient shape to race. After Russian Vladimir Gusev was fired by his professional team for failing an internal doping check, he was replaced in this event by Denis Menchov, who later competed in the time trial. While training earlier in the week before the race, Switzerland's Michael Albasini crashed and broke his collarbone; there was not sufficient time to find a replacement for him.
Preview.
Pollution issues.
Prior to the opening of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the organizing body considered re-scheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.
Independent sources showed that pollution levels were above the limit deemed safe by the World Health Organization on August 9. However, the cycling event went ahead as scheduled with no objections from the athletes. Fifty-three of the 143 cyclists pulled out during the race; however, this is not unusual (over half withdrew mid-race at the 2004 Summer Olympics). Post-race, a number of riders highlighted the punishing conditions, in particular the heat () and humidity (90%), which were much higher than in Europe, where the majority of UCI ProTour races are held. Pollution, however, was not widely cited as a problem, though Stefan Schumacher of Germany, who had been considered an outside favorite for victory in the event, said the elements and the pollution played a role in his withdrawal.
Pre-race favorites.
Among the pre-race favorites was the entire Spanish contingent of riders. It included two winners of Grand Tours in Alberto Contador and Carlos Sastre, along with highly regarded countrymen Alejandro Valverde, winner of the 2008 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and the reigning Spanish national road race champion, and Samuel Sánchez, who had won three stages in the 2007 Vuelta a España. They also had 2008 Tour de France points classification winner and three-time world champion Óscar Freire available to work on their behalf. Valverde was seen as the strongest threat among the Spaniards. Other medal hopefuls included the defending Olympic champion Paolo Bettini of Italy, Germany's Stefan Schumacher, and Australian Cadel Evans, twice a runner-up in the Tour de France (2007 and 2008). It was thought that members of the overall strong squads from Germany and Luxembourg could also contend for victory. The German team contained Schumacher and many veterans of Grand Tours such as Jens Voigt to work in support, while Luxembourg had the Schleck brothers Andy and Fränk, along with Kim Kirchen, all of whom had worn leader's jerseys during the 2008 Tour de France.
Course.
The Urban Road Cycling Course (one of Beijing's nine temporary venues) was in its entirety, and the men's race was a distance of , the longest in Olympic history. The race's starting line was located at the Yongdingmen Gate, a remnant of Beijing's old city wall, which is a part of the Chongwen District of northern Beijing. The course ended at the Juyong Pass in the Changping District.
The men's race layout, which differed most significantly from the women's in that it was over double its length, saw the riders make seven loops back-and-forth between the Badaling and Juyong Passes. The early sections of the race took place within central Beijing; consequently, the gradient of this part of the race was relatively flat. At approximately the point in the race the riders reached the Badaling section of the Great Wall, and began their first of seven loops. The riders encountered an increase in the gradient at this point, with the Badaling Pass gaining in elevation over a distance of from the start of the circuit to the highest point. From there the cyclists rode over a false flat before descending a highway towards the Juyong Pass. The final of the race gave the riders a moderately steep climb to contend with, which was designed to ensure an exciting finale should several riders have been grouped together at the end of the race, as there were.
Due to security regulations put in place by the Olympic organizers, no spectators were permitted to stand roadside along the course. This decision proved to be controversial: several prominent figures in cycling, including UCI president Pat McQuaid and riders Stuart O'Grady and Cadel Evans (both Australia), spoke out against it. McQuaid and O'Grady both felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. Cycling Australia's reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow, but they were not.
Race.
The men's road race began at 11:00 local time (UTC+8) and within of the start, Horacio Gallardo (Bolivia) and Patricio Almonacid (Chile) formed a two-man breakaway. They held a maximum advantage of 15 minutes, but were never really seen as a threat, and in fact neither went on to finish the race. With no single team willing to force the pace, a 26-man breakaway formed at the mark, including Carlos Sastre (Spain), Kim Kirchen (Luxembourg), Jens Voigt (Germany), Roman Kreuziger (Czech Republic) and Simon Gerrans (Australia). Shortly after the race reached the finish line to begin the first of seven loops, Gallardo was dropped by Almonacid. The lone Chilean leader was then caught by the now 24-man chase group at the summit on the second loop, after riding solo ahead of the pack for over an hour and a half.
Under the impetus of Sastre and Kreuziger in particular, the 24-strong breakaway group built their lead to over six minutes at the half-way point of the race, after four of the seven circuits. At that point, the Italian-paced main field increased its speed in order to bring them back. Aleksandr Kuschynski (Belarus) and Ruslan Pidgornyy (Ukraine) went clear of the leading group afterward and gained an advantage of a minute and 40 seconds over the Sastre group and 2 minutes, 45 seconds over the main field by the start of the fifth lap over the hilly circuit. The Sastre group was absorbed by the main field at the to go mark, leaving just Kuschynski and Pidgornyy out front. Not long after, shortly before the end of the fifth circuit, Marcus Ljungqvist (Sweden), Rigoberto Urán (Colombia) and Johan Van Summeren (Belgium) attacked from the peloton and reeled in Kuschynski and Pidgornyy.
The next attack, one that would later be described as "audacious" and "brave", came from Christian Pfannberger (Austria), who went free of the main field toward the end of the sixth lap. His maximum advantage never grew to more than a minute, but he did stay away until well into the seventh and final lap, being caught with to go. Within five minutes of fierce attacks, fewer than 20 riders were left in the front group, a group that included Cadel Evans (Australia), Levi Leipheimer (United States), Santiago Botero (Colombia), and Jérôme Pineau (France), with Valverde and Bettini left behind them. Five riders, Samuel Sánchez (Spain), Michael Rogers (Australia), Davide Rebellin (Italy), Andy Schleck (Luxembourg), and Alexandr Kolobnev (Russia), came further clear from the group of now 13 due to repeated attacks from Schleck. Sánchez, Rebellin, and Schleck reached the summit of the Badaling climb, with to race, 10 seconds ahead of Rogers and Kolobnev, and 26 seconds ahead of the Evans group. Bettini, Valverde and Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) attacked from the main peloton and joined the Evans group at the top of the climb. The leading group's advantage over the two-man chase was 15 seconds with to go.
With left, Cancellara attacked from the Evans group and caught up with the chasers that the group of three had left behind, Kolobnev and Rogers. The three of them successfully bridged the gap to the leaders with about to go, and there were six riders contesting the final sprint. Sánchez won the gold medal, Rebellin the silver, and Cancellara the bronze.
Doping incident.
In April 2009, the IOC announced that six athletes had tested positive during the 2008 Summer Olympics, without mentioning names or sports. Later, rumours emerged that the athletes included two cyclists, one of them a medal winner. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) then confirmed that a male Italian cyclist had tested positive for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) during the men's road race, without identifying him. The next day, on 29 April 2009, the Committee confirmed that Rebellin was an involved athlete. Rebellin's agent sent a request for the analysis of the B sample. On 8 July 2009, Rebellin, along with Schumacher, were confirmed as having tested positive. Schumacher was already serving a ban after testing positive in the 2008 Tour de France, but faces further punishment, and Rebellin subsequently had his medal removed by the UCI and the IOC. On 27 November, Rebellin returned his silver medal to CONI, per their and the UCI's request. Per UCI regulations, Cancellara and Kolobnev were moved up to second and third in the official results, but did not initially receive new medals. On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of Ittigen, Switzerland. The medal originally given to Cancellara will in turn be given to Kolobnev.
Rebellin had appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the decision to remove his silver medal, but in July 2010, this was rejected.
There had been controversy in the months before the men's road race when, in the aftermath of doping revelations at the Tour de France, International Olympic Committee vice-president Thomas Bach had suggested that the men's road race's place in the Olympics should be reconsidered, and said that the credibility of the sport had been damaged; although he clarified that there was no immediate threat. Pat McQuaid had reacted angrily to these comments, saying, "Why should they majority of cyclists be threatened because of a few bad apples?"
Final classification.
A total of 142 riders have been qualified in the event at these Games. Most of them are not expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.
The notation "s.t." indicates that the rider crossed the finish line in the same group as the one receiving the time above him, and was therefore credited with the same finishing time.

Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's road race

The women's road race was one of the cycling events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. It took place on 10 August 2008, featuring 66 women from 33 countries. It was the seventh appearance of an Olympic women's road race event and featured a longer course than any of the previous six races. The race was run on the Urban Road Cycling Course (one of Beijing's nine temporary venues), which is in its entirety. Including a second lap around the final circuit, the total distance of the women's race was , less than half the length of the men's race. 
Heavy rain during most of the race made conditions difficult for the competitors. A group of five broke away during the final lap and worked together until the final sprint, where Nicole Cooke won the race. Cooke earned Great Britain's first medal at these Games and 200th Olympic gold medal overall. Emma Johansson of Sweden and Tatiana Guderzo of Italy, finishing second and third place with the same time as Cooke, received silver and bronze medals respectively.
The race marked the first positive drug test of the 2008 Olympic Games, by María Isabel Moreno of Spain. She was scheduled to compete in this event and the time trial to follow, but left Beijing on 31 July, before the race. The International Olympic Committee said on 11 August that she had tested positive for EPO. This left 66 cyclists to compete, one fewer than in 2004.
Qualification.
The 2008 Summer Olympics marked the seventh appearance of an Olympic women's road race event. Qualification for the race was restricted to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC) for the 16 top-ranked countries in overall Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) standings at 1 June 2008, and a maximum of two athletes each for the countries ranking 17–24. An NOC with an athlete in the top 100 at 31 May 2008 received a place, which was taken from the countries ranked 17–24 in reversed order, provided that these athletes qualified through the UCI World Tour rankings. Additionally, three places were available at the B World Championship for NOCs that did not qualify through the UCI standing; Gu Sun-Geun, Hae Ok-Jeong and Thatsani Wichana secured Olympic qualification for their NOCs in this way, but only the first was chosen by her national committee to compete. The maximum quota of the event was set at 67 cyclists, and as of 5 June, 66 cyclists were qualified in this way. Although the Chinese and Austrian NOCs were allowed to enter three cyclists, they only entered two. This left three open positions: two were allotted to South Africa and New Zealand, based on their World Tour rankings, and the third was given to Mauritius by direct invitation. Only 66 of the 67 entrants began the race, as María Isabel Moreno of Spain left the country days earlier after failing a drug test.
Preview.
Judith Arndt, the German rider who finished second at the 2004 Summer Olympics, was a strong favourite. Arndt had recently finished first at the 2008 Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal, and her form in the months that preceded the race was excellent. Among other contenders were UCI Women's Road standings leader, Marianne Vos of the Netherlands; Briton Nicole Cooke, who said she had greater confidence in her team on this occasion than in 2004, when she finished fifth; and Noemi Cantele of Italy. The Australian team was considered strong: it included Sara Carrigan (the defending champion), Oenone Wood (winner of the 2008 Australian Road Race), and Katherine Bates, all of whom could work on each other's behalf. Because the final leg of the course involved steep ramps, riders considered to be climbing experts (including Cooke, Vos, and Susanne Ljungskog) were favoured.
Although not seen as a strong medal contender, one former champion participating in the race was 49-year-old Jeannie Longo from France, who won the road race in 1996 and had competed in the inaugural event in 1984, making this her seventh appearance.
Many cyclists expected tropical conditions during the race and adjusted their training to compensate. For example, Marianne Vos prepared in El Salvador. Cyclists had also anticipated a problem with high levels of pollution in Beijing, but these did not appear to affect the results of the men's road race. Although the pollution levels in Beijing on 10 August far exceeded the World Health Organisation's safety level, the rain during the women's race decreased the smog level.
In the men's race, conducted the previous day, humidity and heat had taken the greatest toll on the athletes. To compensate for the expected warm weather, some female cyclists chose not to wear undershirts. This proved to be a misjudgment, as conditions were cooler in the Great Wall section than on the previous day— compared to . Thunderstorms, bringing persistently heavy rain and strong winds, resulted in actual race conditions far different from expected. Other riders, such as Katherine Bates (who did not finish), prepared by wearing cooling vests before the race and stocked up on ice packs during it.
Course.
The race was run on the Urban Road Cycling Course (one of Beijing's nine temporary venues), which was in its entirety. Unlike the previous Olympic races, the start and finish were not at the same location. The early section of the race took place within central Beijing; the gradient of this part of the race was relatively flat. After approximately , the riders reached the Badaling section of the Great Wall and began two loops of between the Badaling and Juyong Passes. The gradient increased at this point, as the Badaling Pass gained in elevation from the start of the circuit to the highest point, including ramps as steep as a 10 percent gradient. From there the cyclists rode over a false flat before descending a highway towards the Juyong Pass. The final were a moderately steep climb, designed to ensure an exciting finale should several riders be grouped together at the end of the race. In total, the distance of the women's race was , less than half the length of the men's race.
The race's starting line was at the Yongdingmen Gate, a remnant of Beijing's old city wall, which is a part of the Chongwen District of northern Beijing. The route passed through eight districts: Chongwen, Xuanwu, Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Changping, and Yanqing. Landmarks such as the Temple of Heaven, the Great Hall of the People, Tiananmen Square, the Yonghe Temple, and sections of the Great Wall of China were passed as the course journeyed from urban Beijing into the countryside. It passed the architectural features of the 2008 Olympics, including the Beijing National Stadium and Beijing National Aquatics Center (known colloquially as the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube). The course ended at the Juyong Pass in the Changping District. The course's scenery was described by "The Guardian" as "visually sumptuous".
Due to security regulations put in place by the Olympic organisers, spectators were not permitted to stand roadside along the course. Several prominent figures in cycling protested against this decision, including UCI president Pat McQuaid and two Australian riders, Stuart O'Grady and Cadel Evans, who competed in the men's race. McQuaid and O'Grady felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. Cycling Australia's reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow, but this plea was ignored.
Race.
The race started at 14:00 China Standard Time (UTC+8), and was scheduled to last until 17:30. The weather was unseasonably cool. It was cloudy and the roads were dry at the start of the race. The clouds brought steady rainfall midway through the race, making conditions challenging.
The race saw some incidents which caused riders to lose valuable time. Gu Sun-Geun (South Korea) lost control of her bike, bringing others down with her. She eventually fell into a concrete ditch on the side of the highway. Natalia Boyarskaya (Russia), who had built a lead of 59 seconds over the top of Badaling, had to stop to see which way to choose at a poorly marked intersection.
The chase for Boyarskaya was led by Christine Thorburn (United States), who brought the lead down to 34 seconds prior to the final loop of . Emma Pooley (Great Britain) and Tatiana Guderzo (Italy) rode away from the bunch on the climb and caught Boyarskaya with to go, forming a three rider breakaway. The German team, with a steady pace, caught them soon after. Guderzo attacked with about to go over the final summit. She was soon joined by Christiane Soeder (Austria), Emma Johansson (Sweden), Nicole Cooke (Great Britain) and Linda Villumsen (Denmark). With remaining, the group had gained 16 seconds on the main peloton. Marianne Vos (Netherlands), one of the pre-race favourites who was not in the leading group, hesitated before leading the chase together with other pre-race favourite Judith Arndt. Cooke looked out of contention as the five came round the final bend, but she came around the other riders with to go, claiming the gold medal with a clear margin. Johansson came in second and Guderzo won the bronze. Vos eventually led the bunch over the finish line, 21 seconds after the winner.
It was later revealed that Cooke had held back intentionally, as she was using lightweight tyres not suited to rainy conditions. The British women's road team manager Julian Winn said "We were afraid someone might come down in front of her, so we told her to keep to the left. We knew she would chew them up after that." Cooke's victory was the result of meticulous planning, as the team had ridden the course before the race and formulated the winning plan.
Doping incident.
The day after the race, an International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson announced that Spanish rider María Isabel Moreno had become the first athlete of the 2008 Olympics to test positive for a banned substance.
Moreno had provided a urine sample the day she arrived in Beijing (31 July), but flew back to Madrid on the same day, after suffering a panic attack, and did not return to take part in the race. The urine sample tested positive for erythropoietin (EPO). The IOC stripped Moreno of her Games accreditation, later referring the matter to the UCI which confirmed the positive result. A statement on Moreno's website read that "she does not feel ready to justify or explain her reasons for leaving the village".
Final classification.
A total of 66 cyclists have been qualified in the event at these Games. Most of them are not expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit would be forced to stop, although this situation did not occur.
The notation "s.t." indicates that the rider crossed the finish line in the same group as the cyclist before her, and was therefore credited with the same finishing time.

House Dance International

House Dance International (“HDI”) is an annual street dance festival based in New York City that highlights the art forms of House dance, Vogue, Hustle, Waacking and Experimental, all of which are performed to house music or derivatives of electronic dance music. The three-day festival consists of a group choreography contest, freestyle competitions (i.e., "battles"), film screenings, seminars, workshops and parties. Established in 2007, HDI was the only event of its kind that exclusively focuses on the dance forms associated with house music culture (as compared to hip-hop dance forms such as b-boying, popping, locking, krumping, etc.).
Mission.
HDI represents a New York-based mission to bring together the various individuals and organizations that have played a role in the creation and development of house dance culture. Dating back to the 1970s in New York and Chicago, the culture grew out of the clubs and social networks of the black and Latino gay community. Noteworthy clubs in Chicago included the Warehouse, Riviera, Music Box, and Medusa's. Landmark New York clubs where House dance developed included Paradise Garage, The Loft, and Sound Factory Bar.
With the invention of house music in 1983, house dance culture began to flourish in a cross-section of urban society, attracting dancers from all walks of life, ethnic backgrounds, socioeconomic classes and sexual orientations. The culture became a melting pot and repository for all types of dance styles: tap, jazz, modern, capoeira, salsa, b-boying, hip-hop that eventually morphed into its own distinctive style. The contribution of the various styles was fostered by the open-minded nature of the culture, which thrives on themes of liberation, unity and mutual passion for the music.
Until the establishment of HDI, however, there had not been a formal recognition of the primary styles that had come to define the culture, specifically, House dance, Vogue, Waacking, Hustle, and Experimental. HDI brought the culture into focus and differentiated it from hip-hop culture, which many had mistakenly viewed as the precursor to House Dance.
Event History.
The idea to host an annual NYC-based event dedicated to the various forms of house dance culture was conceived by house dancer and event producer Santiago Freeman in September 2006. As a descendent of Chicago’s original house dance / jacking scene of the mid-1980s, Santiago set out to produce the world’s most comprehensive festival dedicated to the art form of dancing to house music. Enlisting the help of top event promoter Redness, the first HDI event was launched in July 2007. The first event was held at Sullivan Room, Alvin Ailey Studios and Club Shelter. Judges in 2007 included Archie Burnett, Conrad Rochester, Junious Brickhouse, Marjory Smarth, and James “Cricket” Colter. The co-founders sought legendary house dance pioneer Ejoe Wilson to be the Host / MC of the event.
Attendees.
Between 2007 and 2008, the HDI event has been attended by thousands of dancers, DJs, house music enthusiasts and spectators from around the globe, including from South Africa, Japan, Korea, London, Paris, Sweden, Montreal, Belgium and Taiwan. Surveys conducted by the HDI organizers indicate that 25% of the attendees are from Japan, 23% from New York, 23% from out-of-state, 18% percent from Europe, and 6% from Canada, with the remaining 5% from other regions of Asia. As house dance culture begins to proliferate worldwide, attendance is expected to increase exponentially.
Freestyle Competition Format.
HDI features five specific categories of freestyle competitions: House dance, Vogue, Experimental, Hustle, and Waacking.
All contestants must qualify for final rounds by auditioning at preliminary rounds. Each contestant receives approx. 2 minutes to dance in a solo exhibition to music selected by the DJ. A panel of five judges scores each contestant on the basis of four criteria: (1) musicality/rhythm; (2) technique/vocabulary; (3) charisma/free spirit and (4). The top contestants with the highest mathematical scores in each category advance to the final rounds.
Group Choreography Contest.
In addition to the freestyle competitions, HDI also plays host to a group choreography contest that showcases the talents of groups within the house dance community. Groups are scored on a mathematical scale by a panel of judges using the following criteria: (1) musicality / rhythm; (2) vocabulary; (3) originality / creativity; (4) charisma; (5) synchronicity / transitions; (6) staging / blocking; (7) costume design. The winner of the Group Choreography Contest in 2008 was an all-female group from Osaka, Japan called “Soul Flower”.
Workshops.
In 2007 and 2008, HDI hosted its Master Workshop Series at Alvin Ailey Studios in Manhattan. 
2007 instructors included Brian “Footwork” Greene, Ejoe Wilson, Marjory Smarth and Archie Burnett. 2008 instructors included Akim Funk Buddha, Tyrone Proctor, Sergia Anderson, Ejoe Wilson and Archie Burnett. In 2009, the workshops were held at Dance New Amsterdam, instructors included David Padilla, Ejoe Wilson, Tyrone Proctor, and Archie Burnett. 
2010 instructors included FootworKingz, Akim Funk Buddha, Yugson, Aus Ninja, Ejoe Wilson and many more.
The HDI workshops are designed to bring top instruction in the various forms of House Dance to international students of the art form.
Film Screenings.
Consistent with its theme of advancing House Dance culture, HDI has screened various films that address the subject matter of House Dance. Past films screenings have included:
Host / MC.
HDI is hosted by its Master of Ceremonies, Ejoe Wilson, age 39, who stands as one of the most influential House Dancers on the planet. His life as a dancer has been documented in numerous films, including "Check Your Body at the Door" and "Maestro", and his work has been featured in videos for MC Lyte, Jungle Brothers, Will Smith and Mariah Carey, with whom he accompanied on five world tours. Ejoe now travels the world teaching his unique style of house dance, which has been described as “The Truth”. He is credited with innovating House Dance through the infusion of Jacking with dynamic floorwork, lofting and acrobatics, a style that has been emulated the world over. Ejoe is co-host of Soulgasm, a house dance event based in New York, and is the artistic director of Beyond Phenomenon, an avant-garde house dance company.
DJs.
House Dance International has featured some of the world’s most prestigious house music DJs including DJ Spinna, the Martinez Brothers, Quentin Harris, Filsonik, DJ Sabine, Brian Coxx, Chip-Chop Ninja and Pang-Lo.

4. In European countries and Asia, House Dance was introduced by a series of New York-based dancers who had gravitated to house dance from hip-hop culture in the early 1990s. As a result, house dance has been viewed as an extension or derivative of hip-hop culture when it in fact developed on its own trajectory in nightclubs throughout the 1980s, independent of what was happening in hip-hop culture.

Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's road time trial

The Men's road time trial at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on 13 August at the Urban Road Cycling Course. It was won by Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland.
Pre-race favorites.
Included among the favorites for victory were Cancellara, the reigning world time trial champion, and Germany's Stefan Schumacher, who won both time trials in the 2008 Tour de France, defeating Cancellara in each. Other cyclists considered to be possible medalists included American Dave Zabriskie, and Australians Michael Rogers and Cadel Evans. Evans had originally announced that he was withdrawing from the time trial with a knee injury, giving his place in the event to Rogers, but he recovered faster than expected. The UCI thus gave him a wildcard entry to let him compete. American Levi Leipheimer, Spaniard Alberto Contador, Italy's Marzio Bruseghin and Denis Menchov of Russia were also thought to be contenders for the podium.
The event.
The men's road time trial took place on a mountainous 47.6 km course consisting of two 23.8 km laps each containing an approximately 305 m climb followed by an equal descent. The 39 riders in the time trial were broken into three groups, who would race the clock one hour separate from one another. Most of the medal favorites were in the last group. Each rider started the course a minute and thirty seconds after the rider who went before them.
The leader at the end of the first group of 13 was Svein Tuft (Canada), completing the course in 1h 04' 39". This was 23 seconds clear of the next closest competitor Robert Gesink (Netherlands). They were still the top two riders after the second group, with American David Zabriskie and Russian Denis Menchov, thought to be podium contenders, both turning in disappointing rides.
The medalists all came in the third group. Gustav Larsson of Sweden, starting seventh from the end, beat Tuft by nearly two minutes. The man after Larsson, American Levi Leipheimer, was 36 seconds slower than Larsson, but held on to win bronze. The event's prohibitive favorite, world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara, started last, and though he was six seconds behind Larson's pace at the final time check, he wound up winning the gold medal by a margin of 33 seconds. The other major gold medal favorite, Stefan Schumacher of Germany, finished over three minutes behind Cancellara.

Elephant Tea Rooms

The Elephant Tea Rooms is a Grade II listed building in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England. The building was constructed from 1873 to 1877 by Frank Caws for Ronald Grimshaw, a local tea merchant, in a blend of the high Victorian Hindu Gothic and Venetian Gothic styles. This was selling point, as the exotic style and name advertised the exotic origins of the tea sold there.
Exterior.
The exterior is polychrome and was constructed from brick, terracotta and faience. The ground floor has a full-width tiled fascia continuing along to the neighbouring building; this 20th-century alteration may conceal earlier detail. The arcaded first floor has sash windows with sloping sills in the Gothic faience arcade, clasping rings and crocket capitals to the nookshafts, alternate block jambs, raised pointed arches and roll-moulded dripstring. The ogee window heads have fleur-de-lys finials in front of lozenge-patterned terracotta spandrels. The eaves cornice has a corbelled trefoil frieze.
The attic windows have faience surrounds, similar to the first floor arcade, two trefoil-headed transom lights over mullioned lights, each window is in a high gable with round-headed niches in a banded faience decoration and moulded coping. Between the gables there are bracketed corniced shelves carrying faience elephants under bracketed gables with trefoil bargeboards with a crocket decoration and elaborate finials.
The round oriel corner turret has nookshafts like the other first floor arcades but with arcaded central lights and blind arches, below a band of linked, splayed shafts and large eaves gargoyles. Above are further gablets are at the foot of the banded round turret with bracketed, eaves and a Buddhist-style conical faience roof with a series of ringed ribs. Smaller high cones on patterned drums are behind the crow-stepped gable foot at the end of each front.
The steeply-pitched roof is of slate, has ridges from each gable with terracotta crestings, faeience gable copings and tall, faience coping (behind the elephant gablets) and brick chimneys.

Laid to Rest (film)

Laid to Rest is a 2009 slasher film written and directed by Robert Green Hall. It was followed by a 2011 sequel entitled "".
Plot.
A young woman with head wound-induced amnesia breaks out of a coffin in a funeral home, and dials 911 in the morgue, but accidentally unhooks the telephone while speaking to the operator. The mortician appears, and is impaled by a man equipped with a chrome skull mask, and a shoulder mounted camera. The girl stabs ChromeSkull in the eye, and runs off while he treats his wound. The girl is picked up by Tucker, who takes her home to his wife Cindy, and promises her that they will go to the sheriff's station in the morning, as Tucker's truck is low on gas, and their phone service has been cut off.
ChromeSkull tracks the girl (who has been nicknamed "Princess" after she remembers playing with a Princess Gemstone doll) to Tucker's house, and kills Cindy when Tucker refused to give him the girl. Tucker and Princess escape in Tucker's truck as ChromeSkull deals with Cindy's brother Johnny and his girlfriend, who had come by to check on Cindy after having earlier seen Tucker with Princess. Tucker and Princess seek aid from a recluse named Steven, who uses his computer to email for help, and research ChromeSkull, discovering he is a serial killer whose modus operandi is to send tapes of himself murdering women to the authorities.
The trio go to the police station, and find the sheriff and a deputy dead, and ChromeSkull waiting for them. The group wound ChromeSkull's leg, and drive away, reaching the funeral home, which Princess goes into, despite Steven and Tucker's protests. Tucker returns home to cover up Cindy's body, and get his gun, while Princess explores the area, and discovers that a nearby barn contains several of ChromeSkull's previous victims, including one who is still alive. ChromeSkull beheads the captive, knocks Princess out, and places her in a casket. Before ChromeSkull can kill Princess, he is shot by Tucker, who breaks Princess out of the coffin, and drives away with her and Steven in ChromeSkull's car.
Princess looks at footage on ChromeSkull's camera, which shows he was in league with the mortician, who he killed due to the man becoming a liability (the sheriff was beginning to question him about the barn). Princess takes the car while Tucker and Steven are removing the bodies of his wife and brother-in-law from the trunk, and is locked inside by ChromeSkull, who uses his cellphone to take control of the onboard computer as he follows Princess to a convenience store in the funeral home's hearse. Via paperwork in the car, Princess finds out ChromeSkull's name is Jesse Cromeans, right before he attacks her.
ChromeSkull prepares to kill Princess, but he is out of tapes for his camera, so he coerces her into going into the store to get one. The clerk sees the threatening messages ChromeSkull is sending Princess through a cellphone he had given her, goes out to confront him, and has his head blown off when ChromeSkull turns his own shotgun on him. A customer goes to lock the backdoor, and is decapitated by ChromeSkull. Tucker and Steven reach the store, grab ChromeSkull's suitcase on the way in, and replace the glue he uses to keep his mask on with Cyanoacrylate. ChromeSkull cuts the power, and causes Steven's face to explode by injecting Canned tire inflator into his ear. Tucker is stabbed while trying to give Princess enough time to escape with Tommy, the murdered customer's friend.
ChromeSkull locks Tommy out of the building, and traps Princess in a freezer. To taunt Princess, ChromeSkull gives her his camera, which reveals she was a drug addicted prostitute he had picked up, and that she lost her memory when ChromeSkull beat her with a bat. Princess smashes the camera in frustration, and while struggling with ChromeSkull, knocks his mask off. ChromeSkull goes to reaffix his mask, unknowingly using the Cyanoacrylate that Steven had replaced his adhesive with. The chemical melts ChromeSkull's face, and as he writhes in agony, Princess bludgeons him with an aluminum bat.
Princess finds her missing persons notice (which Steven had printed off his computer) in Tucker's pocket, and leaves with Tommy. Before dying, Tucker gets a glimpse of his wife, who tells him she loves him. The police arrive, and find the flyer, on the back of which Princess had written: "I'm the girl. Waited all night. This is your guy. His car is the nice one outside. Dead girls in the barn behind the funeral home. Please bury Stephen (sic) with his mom".
Release.
"Laid to Rest" received a limited theatrical run in March 2009. It was released on home video April 21, 2009.
Reception.
Dread Central gave the film a four out of five, concluding ""Laid to Rest" does have some minor issues with pacing at first but really finds its stride about 30 minutes in and just keeps moving along until the very end. What I like here is that Hall was able to create a slasher film with characters we care about but definitely doesn't take anything too seriously either, giving horror fans a movie that's both entertaining and a lot of fun to watch". DVD Talk awarded three out of five, which said that while "Laid to Rest" "contrives a lot of convenient coincidences to keep the plot rolling" and was "admittedly lacking in logic" it was still "an entertaining 90 minute thrill ride". DVD Verdict also responded well to "Laid to Rest", writing that it was "an inventive, sick as all get out thrill-ride" and "an entertaining, engaging slasher movie". Scott Weinberg of Fearnet wrote, "Powerfully gory, peppered with unexpected doses of weird humor, and backed by a colorful cast of familiar faces, Rob Hall's Laid to Rest is hardly the most original or trail-blazing terror tale out there -- but it's an '80s-style throwback piece that gains a lot of mileage out of very little gas."
The film was labeled plotless and "extremely dumb" by The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre, which stated that it had a dull killer and "features people at their stupidest". Film Bizarro said it was "rather illogical and is often quite stupid" and "very monotonous and extremely boring" and that it was ultimately "an utter failure, and not from being a generic title but rather because it has a dull story and dull characters".
Sequels.
The film has been followed by a sequel titled "" and an upcoming prequel.

Microsoft Online Services

Microsoft Online Services is Microsoft's hosted-software offering and a component of their software plus services strategy. Microsoft Online Services are hosted by Microsoft and sold "with" Microsoft partners.
The suite includes Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Office Communications Online, Microsoft Forefront, and Microsoft Office Live Meeting.
For businesses, the Software-plus-Services approach enables organizations to access the capabilities of enterprise software through on-premises servers, as online services, or a combination of both, depending on specific business requirements. Services also provide the option to add complementary capabilities that enhance on-premises server software and simplify system management and maintenance.
Product Suite: Business Productivity Online Standard Suite (BPOS).
The Business Productivity Online Standard Suite represents the first of a growing portfolio of Microsoft Online Services. Microsoft Online Services are a component of the broader Microsoft Software-plus-Services strategy that includes both Live and Online services.
Office 365.
The successor of BPOS is Office 365. Where BPOS is based on Exchange 2007 and MOSS 2007, Office 365 was originally built around the 2010 versions of Exchange and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and now the 2013 versions, since one of the benefits of Office 365 is that it is 'evergreen'. For Instant Messaging, plus audio & video conferencing, Office 365 provides Microsoft Lync.
Apart from these communications and collaboration applications, Office 365 will also have Microsoft Office Professional Plus included, which are the online versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint
Microsoft opened the Beta phase for this service in Q4 of 2010 and the service went live June 28, 2011
Individual products.
"Note: there are two different Exchange-related Online Services: "Exchange Online" and also "Exchange Hosted Services.""
Support.
Microsoft has set up a dedicated support department for BPOS outside their standard "Professional Support Services". One reason can be that the type of support requests will differ from service requests for Microsoft products the customer runs on his own infrastructure: when a company opens a support question because they have problems with mail-sending using Outlook and their own Microsoft Exchange server the technical side of such a support request is totally different than when the customer uses BPOS. Also the expectations of the customer will be different: they have outsourced the services to Microsoft to avoid problems, thus when it doesn't work they expect that Microsoft solves their problem quickly. For that reason a dedicated BPOS and Office 365 support desk is in place in the USA and in Ireland for the EMEA region. Microsoft's main support-providing partner HP has been busy finding and training new Level1 and Level2 support engineers for this desk. The EMEA support desk currently handles 1st line and escalated BPOS cases and is expected to support Office 365 cases after the product went live in June 2011.
Cloud computing and BPOS.
On March 4, 2010, Steve Ballmer gave a speech focused on Microsoft's cloud computing commitment at the University of Washington. Here is an excerpt from the Seattle Times, "The cloud fuels Microsoft and vice versa. 'About 75 percent of our folks are doing entirely cloud based or entirely cloud inspired,' Ballmer said. 'A year from now that will be 90 percent.' This full embrace of the term cloud computing is new for Microsoft. Up until now Microsoft was still pushing the term 'software as a service' to describe cloud software."

Coteau Books

Coteau Books is a small, non-profit literary press based in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. It was established in 1975 by Bob Currie, Gary Hyland, Barbara Sapergia and Geoffrey Ursell when they realized that there was little opportunity for Saskatchewan writers to get published, especially first-time authors.
Coteau Books has grown considerably since its 1975 founding, publishing 16 books a year, from authors across Canada, and adding a substantial and high-profile "young readers" element to its list. Now employing five people, Coteau distributes its books to Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand, and around the world on the internet. It also has rights representation for its titles in most parts of the world. It has published authors from all over Canada, and it has been short listed for or won many literary awards in the country, including the prestigious Governor General's Literary Awards (which Coteau’s Gloria Sawai won in 2001 for her short story collection, A Song for Nettie Johnson). Coteau has had books named GG finalists seven times, in four different genres, which is a rare accomplishment for a press of its size.

Serpentine (video game)

Serpentine is a action computer game developed by David Snider and published by Brøderbund.
Description.
The player controls (rides, by game description ) a multi-segmented blue 'good' serpent in a maze with the objective of eating all computer-controlled 'evil' (red or orange or green) serpents. Eating the tail segments of serpents makes them shorter, and a red or orange serpent turns green when shorter than the player. Hitting a green serpent headfirst eliminates it, and causes the player's serpent to grow an additional segment. Hitting a red or orange serpent headfirst causes the players serpent to die. A frog appears at random intervals and gives any serpent eating it an additional segment. As the game progresses, opposing serpents are faster and longer, increasing the difficulty, and each advancing level the existing players serpent gets slower. Once the players serpent dies, the replacement is as fast again. The game had a total of 20 levels.
One unique aspect of the game is how extra lives are gained. The playing serpent will lay an egg (losing a segment in the process) and, if given enough time, the egg hatches and hurries to the protected area. Enemy serpents will also lay eggs; if one hatches, a new two-segment opponent appears. It is possible to lose the last segment to an egg, resulting in the death of that serpent, but this only happens to the players serpent, not the enemy. If a frog happens to appear while an egg is on the map, it will head towards the egg and eat it as well, even during the end of the level when you cannot control your own serpent to try to eat the frog first. This makes the position where the last serpent is killed important if the player wants to ensure the egg survives.
Serpentine ranked #13 for most popular game of 1982 according to "Softalk" magazine.
Ports.
This game was originally written for the Apple II and ported to the Vic 20, Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800. Most versions included 20 different mazes, but the Atari version only had 5.

<doc id="18664318" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18664318" title="Central Balkan dialect">
Central Balkan dialect

The Central Balkan dialect is a Bulgarian dialect that is part of the Balkan group of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. Its range includes most of north-central Bulgaria (without the regions of Dryanovo and Elena), as well as the regions of Karlovo, Kazanlak and Plovdiv in southern Bulgaria, all the way down to the northernmost ridges of the Rhodopes. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the Central Balkan dialect is now spoken also in vast areas of northeastern Bulgaria. The most significant feature of the dialect is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable. The Central Balkan dialect lies at the foundation of formal Bulgarian. However, it is not identical to the standard language because many of its features derive from the Western Bulgarian dialects, including the Macedonian dialects, or are a compromise between Eastern and Western standard. The Central Balkan dialect includes a number of subdialects, e.g. Troyan, Lovech, Gabrovo, Karlovo, Kalofer, Tryavna, etc. which share many common features and yet have some differences.
Phonological and morphological characteristics.
Most other phonological and morphological characteristics of the Central Balkan dialect are the same as the general features typical for all Balkan dialects, cf. article.

Career.
National team.
During the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, Dueñas, and four other members of the Mexican National Team, tested positive for the banned substance of Clenbuterol and were withdrawn from the team's tournament squad. However, all players were exonerated as FIFA determined that the accused had accidentally ingested the banned substance through contaminated meat that had been served during a pre-tournament training camp.
However, World Anti-Doping Agency appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to request a ban. But on 12 October 2011 WADA withdrew this request after the full file was available for them.

Agkistrodon bilineatus howardgloydi

Agkistrodon bilineatus howardgloydi is a venomous pitviper subspecies found in Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
Etymology.
The subspecific name, "howardgloydi", is in honor of American herpetologist Howard K. Gloyd.
Description.
Of the ten specimens available to Gloyd and Conant (1990) from Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the largest male was 96 cm (37¼ inches) and the largest female 82 cm (32¼ inches) in length. Acceding to Villa (1984), adults in Nicaragua almost never exceed 135 cm (53⅛ inches) in length. In both sexes, the tail length is 19% of the total body length.
Scalation includes 23 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody; 128-135 ventral scales; and 54-61 subcaudal scales, roughly half of which are paired, especially towards the tail tip.
The dorsal color pattern consists of light to medium reddish brown ground color overlaid with 10-14/13-17 broad brown or brownish crossbands in males/females. Large adult males tend to be melanistic. Juveniles are more lightly colored, even to the point of being bright red. The head is clearly marked on either side with two longitudinal light lines: the upper one is narrow and broken or even absent posterior to the supraocular scale; while the lower one is wider and split into two parts which may or may not meet at the suture of the third supralabial scale.
Geographic range.
Found in the dry Pacific lowlands of Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The type locality given is "0.8 km north Mirador el Cañon del Tigre, Parque Nacional Santa Rosa, Provincia Guanacaste, Costa Rica."

Zornia latifolia

Zornia latifolia is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America. Its distribution may extend into Central and North America. It is also known as a naturalized species in tropical western Africa. The plant is known commonly as maconha brava.
Description.
This plant is a perennial herb with a branching stem taking a prostrate form on the ground and growing up to about 50 centimeters long. The leaves are bifoliolate, each made up of two leaflets, which are widely lance-shaped and up to 4 centimeters long. At the base is a stipule up to a centimeter in length. The herbage is hairless to lightly hairy. The inflorescence is a spike of up to 35 yellow flowers each about a centimeter long. The flowers open for only 5 to 10 hours. The bractlets are longer than the flowers and may cover them. The fruit is a spiny, hairy legume pod.
Ecology.
In its native range it grows in savanna habitat with acidic and low-fertility soils. It tolerates drought, but does not tolerate cold or shade. In Africa it grows as a weed in lawns and on roadsides.
The plant is susceptible to plant pathogens such as the fungi "Sphaceloma zorniae", which causes scab disease, and "Meliola" species, which cause stunting and distortion of the leaves. Insect pests include the red-necked peanutworm moth ("Stegasta bosqueella").
Uses.
Forage.
This legume is a nutritious and palatable forage for livestock. It can be grown as a companion plant to grasses such as "Andropogon gayanus" and "Brachiaria decumbens".
Drugs.
This plant is part of many synthetic cannabis mixtures, such as 'Spice'.

Jonathan Stanton (1834–1918) was an ornithologist and longtime professor of Greek and Latin at Bates College.
Career.
A native of Lebanon, Maine and an 1856 graduate of Bowdoin College, Stanton taught at Bates from 1863 until his death in 1918. He taught Greek and Latin, led debates, and taught a popular class in ornithology. The local Stanton Bird Club is still active to this day and the "Stanton Ride", where he paid to have horses and carriages take the freshman class on a picnic where he would tell them the history of the college, continued as a tradition for over 100 years. Referred to by students as "Uncle Johnny" and by college president George C. Chase as "the spirit of Bates", Stanton refused to leave Bates for any other colleges and remains one of the school's most influential professors to this day.

WKZL

WKZL ("107.5 KZL") is a Top 40 Mainstream station licensed to Winston-Salem, North Carolina and serves the Piedmont Triad area, which also includes Greensboro and High Point. The outlet, which is owned by Dick Broadcasting, operates at 107.5 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW.
History.
In 1958, WYFS became the first Winston-Salem station to play classical music. In 1966, the station became WAAA-FM, airing the soul music of WAAA, and WFDD took over classical music. The station began stereo broadcasts in January 1975 and changed its call letters to WKZL.
The station had the call letters WSGH (standing for Winston-Salem / Greensboro / High Point) during the early 1970s when its format was easy listening. For a short period of time in the mid 70s the station featured an eclectic blend of pop, rock and progressive rock selected at random by the hosts. DJs on the air from 1975-1977 included Steve Gold (Marshall), Alan Cameron, Mitch Clarke, Nick Archer, Bruce Key, Ron Spivey, Kitty Kinnin, Reid Stott, Steve Norris, and Steve Day. Production chores were handled by Jack Shaw and Rowell Gormon. The late 70s era of WKZL’s programming was a mix of Top 40 and album cuts formulated into playlists based on focus groups created under the direction of eccentric owner Bob Brown.
Program hosts included Morning Show Host Doug Paul, Rod Davis, Chris Angel, J.J. Hemingway, D.D. Thornton, and Chuck Holloway, who also served as Music Director. Doug Paul served as Program Director during his time at WKZL between 1978 and 1982. During this period, the station was pioneering music research that included weekly focus groups of 18-49 year old listeners assembled by Owner Bob Brown and Sharon Paul. The format of the station was a unique hybrid of Deep Tracks, Top 40 and Jazz. Local music artists were featured in the programming mix and live concerts were broadcast weekly via NBC's THE SOURCE and other radio program syndicators. Known for a keen spot production sound and aggressive demo sales, the WKZL of the late 70's won many local and regional advertising awards and had up to three full time copywriters on staff. 
Brown eventually sold WAAA to Mutter Evans, who made history at age 25 by becoming the youngest black woman to own a commercial radio station in the US. Soon afterwards Brown sold WKZL to Nationwide Broadcasting, while maintaining ownership of the building that housed both stations.
When Nationwide took control and installed Station Manager Rick Fromme and Program Director Tom Daniels, the station changed its format to the more classic AOR (Album-oriented rock) under the guidance of the radio consultant firm Burkhart/Abrams. By 1982, WKZL was known by its slogan as “North Carolina’s Best Rock”. The playlist was built around well-known stadium artists such as Pink Floyd, The Who, and Led Zeppelin along with Southern Rock favorites Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Allman Brothers Band, and Molly Hatchet. Heavy metal artists AC/DC, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, and copycat artists also shared the spotlight with AOR pop artists REO Speedwagon and Journey. 
Some of the original staff remained - including Chuck Holloway and Kitty Kinnin - but most of the new staff brought on board came from other AOR stations. DJs included DD Thornton, Danno Lopez, Charlie McGee, Tim Hogan and Neal Cassady. 
Although WKZL branded itself as a classic rock station, it also distinguished itself as a leader in a small way with a new music program launched in March 1982 called the "New Generation Show". Former WKZL DJ DD Thornton submitted a proposal for a one-hour Sunday evening show to introduce new, innovative artists to the classic rock audience. Her proposal was considered so risky WKZL had to present it to Burkhart/Abrams asking for approval. Lee Abrams granted approval to give the show a test run. 
The show debuted in March 1982 on Sunday evenings from 11:00 to midnight. Among the featured artists were Elvis Costello, The Pretenders, and XTC. The show became so popular that station manager Fromme decided to expand the show from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Around the same time, local nightclub "Casablanca" asked to try a live version of the show on Monday nights. That weekly event drew large crowds and ran for several years. Eventually the "New Generation Show" was expanded to Sundays from 10:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. and was live at several clubs in Winston-Salem and Greensboro.
The popularity of many of the new artists that were played on "New Generation," the introduction of MTV, and the dedication of record and radio professionals who recognized the value of these new artists, prompted WKZL to open its format a bit and bring new artists such as X, the English Beat, the Psychedelic Furs, Berlin, Gary Numan, Wall of Voodoo, Duran Duran, U2, and R.E.M., into regular rotation. Because of Thornton's persistence, R.E.M.'s song "Radio Free Europe" was allowed into WKZL's playlist, making WKZL one of the first major commercial stations to play R.E.M.'s music in high rotation.
WKZL went through a series of Program Directors grappling with the emergence of pop bands gaining popularity through MTV and how to balance these modern bands with the traditional “classic rock” format. By 1984, the hard-edge sound gave way to the pop sounds of Prince, Michael Jackson, and other artists who frequented Billboard’s Top 40 charts. 
While the "New Generation Show" remained popular, as the station format and management evolved towards mainstream, program creator and producer DD Thornton altered the program name to "Choice Cuts" as a way of keeping pace with WKZL's changing facade, although the show's format remained the same. Yet as WKZL's format increasingly moved away from rock and into CHR, the juxtaposition of a show featuring groundbreaking artists with formulaic hits became more incongruous. Thornton cancelled the show and eventually left WKZL.
For most of the 90s, WKZL called itself "107.5 The Eagle", playing adult contemporary music. For a brief time, the station was modern adult contemporary, competing directly with "98-7 The Point" (which changed to variety hits in 2005). Eventually the decision was made to return to Top 40. That came in 1999, around Labor Day weekend, when the station stunted, with recordings by management saying that the station was underperforming and that all the deejays were suspended until a new plan could be worked out. Morning man Jack Murphy was with the station from 1993 until 2012. The core of the Murphy in the Morning Show for most of the 90's was Jack, joined by Terrie Knight (who also did news) and Chris Kelly (who also produced the show). Knight and Kelly exited in 1999, when Kelly went to do the "2 Guys Named Chris" show on Dick Broadcasting's other property, Rock 92 (WKRR). Knight went to do afternoons (at KZL), where she stayed until 2005 when she left the station and radio, altogether. 
Jared (Jared Pike) and Katie (Katie O'Brien) took over the morning show in June of 2012 and quickly took the show back to #1 in key demographics. Jared and Katie in the Morning broadcast Monday - Friday between 6am - 10am. Known for Jared and Katie's Phonetap, War of the Roses, Torture Tuesday, Hotseat,Group Therapy, sharing everything about their lives and crazy on the street stunts - keeping their audience engaged and entertained. They are joined on air by Producer Whitney (Whitney Thore), Hugs O'Houlihan (Thomas Marvin), and Jason Goodman.

Frank Catrone

Frank Catrone, Jr. (born c.1904) was an American Thoroughbred horse racing jockey best known for winning the 1965 Kentucky Derby as a trainer.
Catrone stood 4 feet 9 inches tall. While selling newspapers at a stand outside Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York, the diminutive 17-year-old was offered the chance to train to be a jockey by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer Sam Hildreth. Although Catrone met with some success as a jockey, he achieved nationwide recognition as a trainer. Battling weight problems, in 1936 he began his professional career as a trainer. In the early 1940s, he trained for Texan Emerson F. Woodward's Valdina Farms. Among his successes for Valdina, Catrone won the 1942 Derby Trial Stakes with Valdina Orphan, who then finished third to winner Shut Out in the Kentucky Derby.
By 1964, Catrone was the secondary trainer behind Clyde Troutt for the breeding/racing stable of Dan and Ada Rice. When the Rices decided to race at Santa Anita Park over the winter of 1964-65, one of the horses Catrone brought West was a colt named Lucky Debonair who had made only one start at age two at the Atlantic City Race Course, where he finished out of the money. In 1965, Lucky Debonair gave Catrone his greatest success in racing, winning the Santa Anita Derby, the Blue Grass Stakes and the Kentucky Derby. In 1966, Lucky Debonair won California's most famous race, the Santa Anita Handicap.
Catrone continued to train for the Rice stable until Dan Rice died in 1975 and his widow, Ada, disbanded the racing stable.

Club career.
N'tsunda started playing professionally in South Africa, with Orlando Pirates FC. In 1994, aged 19, he moved to F.C. Porto in Portugal, but never appeared officially for the club, going on to resume his career in the country's second division, first with F.C. Penafiel on loan.
N'tsunda made his Portuguese top flight debut in the 1996–97 season, scoring two goals in 28 games for G.D. Chaves to help the northerners finish in 10th position.

Bang (company)

BANG is a music and audio post production company based in New York City which creates original music and provides music supervision, sound design and audio production services for advertising, entertainment and interactive media.
History.
BANG was founded in New York City in January, 1989 by former advertising agency creative director Lyle Greenfield. The company was first housed in the studios of hip-hop recording facility, Calliope Productions, where artists such as De La Soul, Queen Latifah, Black Sheep, A Tribe Called Quest, Brand New Heavies and Stereo MCs were recording their first records. (Bob Power, one of the engineer/musician/producers in residence, worked with The Roots, and assisted in the production of Deee-Lite’s crossover club/radio hit “Groove Is In The Heart.”) The sound of these artists and others became a key element in BANG’s early musical identity.
1990s.
In 1993, BANG left Calliope and established its own studios downtown, occupying the second floor of a two-story landmarked building in New York’s Flatiron District. The building, believed to have once been a horse stable, was converted into the company’s recording and office facilities.
In the mid-1990s BANG Music ventured into the record business, forming a boutique label imprint called Notorious Records. The first single, 1995’s “Release Me” in 1995, was a dance-house track that became an international club hit and reached the Top 5 position on "Billboard"s Dance Chart. Composed by then partner C. Joannou, a video for the song was filmed in Greece and the band, known as Industry, was signed by MCA Records in the UK for European distribution.
In 1996 Notorious also released “I Have No Fear”, written by BANG’s Greenfield and British-born composer Gavin Spencer, and performed by singer Annette Taylor under the artist name  Le Monde. The song became a minor club hit and “gay anthem”, rising to #34 on Billboard’s Dance Chart. Dance Hall Of Fame mixer Tom Moulton (“Disco Inferno”) was enlisted to create the “Hallelujah Journey Mix” of the song, which became a seminal DJ spin, later to be licensed by Rhino Records for their “Circuit Party Spins” CD. Notorious followed up “I Have No Fear” in 1997 with a Le Monde house remake of Phil Collins’ iconic hit “In The Air Tonight”. Billboard praised the recording, saying “Just when you think every plausible rock song has been converted into a dance track, here comes another natural selection...This New York-rooted act does a solid job of linking the song’s darkly intense lyrics with a firm house beat and ethereal keyboard.”
Also in 1997, Greenfield joined a group of nearly three dozen music production companies in New York City who were engaged in discussions concerning fair business practices and rights for those hired to create music for the commercial and entertainment industries. The following year a new trade association was incorporated, with Greenfield suggesting its new moniker - AMP: The Association of Music Producers. (AMP). He was voted AMP’s first President and served in that position on the association’s national board for two more terms
Later in 1997, musician Jane Mangini joined the company’s roster of composers. A formally trained keyboardist from the Berklee College of Music who was at the time playing in a piano bar on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, she brought a very different melodic sensibility to the BANG collective—a pronounced stylistic shift from the music of BANG’s guitar-trained composers. In 2001, Mangini married metal guitarist Al Pitrelli in BANG's studio, “given away” by Greenfield in the moments before the ceremony. By 2003, the couple was performing together as musicians with The Trans-Siberian Orchestra on the group’s annual, sold-out Holiday tour.
2000's.
In mid-2000, Greenfield and Joannou amicably ended their partnership.
Also in 2000, Mangini recorded an album of her own compositions at BANG’s studios under the artist name O’2L (pronounced O’Toole). Mangini/O’2L was subsequently signed to a record and distribution deal with Peak Records in Los Angeles by record producer Mark Wexler. She has since recorded her third album for the label.
In January of that year, Greenfield hired Brian Jones, then working at William Morris Agency in New York, as BANG’s executive producer and composer.
Sara Iversen (née Russo) joined BANG as a senior producer and marketing strategist in June, 2000. She had worked previously for advertising agencies, first as account executive at DeVito/Verdi on the Seagram business, then at Lowe Worldwide on GMC. Iversen currently serves as one of BANG’s EPs and Head of Sales.
In 2001, Espen Noreger joined as a composer for BANG. Noreger is best known as the drummer for Norwegian music group The Getaway People, who released two albums on Columbia Records in the U.S
By 2004 Jones was made a full partner in Bang Music. in the years that followed his writing credits, often with co-writer Espen Noreger, would include TV programs and series on NBC, Bravo, TLC, Sundance Film Festival, CBS, Spike, Lifetime, ESPN and E! as well as dozens of commercial spots for National brands.
In early 2008 Brad Stratton joined BANG Music as Executive Producer. Previously, Stratton helped establish Sound Lounge Music and Sound Design in New York City, was a senior producer at Fluid Post and was head of music production at D’Arcy Advertising in New York.
Stratton brought Juno and Thank You for Smoking composer, Mateo Messina, to BANG for commercial representation in the United States.
In September 2008, Ryan Billia joined BANG as its Chief Engineer and sound designer.
In January, 2009 the company celebrated its 20th year in operation.
2010 to Present.
In April 2010, BANG entered into a joint venture with film and television post production company Post FactoryNY, known for its work in films by directors such as the Coen Brothers, Sofia Coppola, Ang Lee, Paul Haggis and Ridley Scott.
In 2010, Jones was hired as music supervisor for the premiere season of the CBS drama Blue Bloods starring Tom Selleck and Donnie Wahlberg. At the same time, BANG continued to expand its work in Television, Film and Interactive audio production completing music supervision and audio post for several films featured at the Sundance and Tribeca Film Festivals as well as a wide variety of games and apps for The Walt Disney Company.
In 2012, Senior Engineer Paul Vitolins joined BANG at its Post FactoryNY facility. In addition to film and TV mixing, Vitolins oversees BANG's work with music streaming service, Spotify, recording live artist sessions in New York City and in tour locations, including at “The Spotify House” during the 2013 SXSW Festival.
In January 2013, Jones was named President of the company, succeeding its founder in that position for the first time. Stratton became a partner and officer.
In April 2013, BANG was commissioned to write a song for the state of New Jersey called "Stronger than the Storm", a jingle that would be a central part of the state's campaign to win back tourism, enterprise, and confidence after the effects of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey.
Also in 2013, Greenfield spearheaded, along with other AMP Board members, the creation of The AMP Awards for Music and Sound, an endeavor he had been championing for several years. It debuted on May 7 in New York City as an integral part of Creative Week.

Power Boys

The Power Boys are two fictional brothers in a series of six children's novels by Mel Lyle, published in the mid-1960s by Whitman Publishing.
The characters.
The two boys, Jack and Chip Power, aged 17 and 15 respectively, with their Dalmatian, Blaze, live with their photojournalist father Thomas, their mother having died before the events in the first book. Jack and Chip travel with Mr. Power, and get involved in various adventures in which they act as detectives, track down criminals and end up in various dangerous situations.
The books feature brief descriptions of the characters' appearance. Jack is described as tall and slender, with reddish-brown hair cut short, and he has green eyes and freckles; Chip is slim, almost as tall as Jack, has blond hair with reddish glints, and his eyes are blue. Jack is portrayed as more serious and dependable, and Chip is more impulsive - sometimes his eyes or face are described as mischievous. Thomas Power is about as tall as Jack, but looks shorter because he is of heavier build. His hair is black and streaked with premature grey. The boys and their father are portrayed as very close to each other.
The stories.
For most of the series it is not clear where the family's regular home is, since the books are set in a wide variety of locations within the U.S. Three of the books are set in New York City (nos. 1, 5, and 6), but it is clear in the first two of these that they are merely visiting the city, and do not live there; in the third of these New York books, which is the last in the series, the family has come to live there, because Barry Donovan, a wealthy man who appeared in book five, could supply Thomas Power with a lot of future work. The first paragraph of this last book tells how much the brothers love their new eight room apartment. We also learn that Mrs. Donovan helped with the decorating. There is a single brief mention in the series of their home being or having been in Chicago, but no scene anywhere in the series is set there.
The boys do not appear to have an extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins, or grandparents; or if they do, they are never mentioned even in passing. But Detective James Wilson of the New York Police Department appears or is mentioned in several of the books, not only in his capacity as a police officer dealing with crimes in the books, but is also mentioned as one of Thomas Power's oldest and dearest friends. Detective Wilson plays a role in the boys' lives similar to that of a favorite uncle.
The boys do not seem to have many long-lasting friends in their own age-group (or at least not ones that are mentioned), but do make friendships which last for the duration of a single book. The single exception to this is that the boys do make friends with Dick Donovan, the son of the aforementioned Barry Donovan, in the fifth book (in which Dick plays a prominent role), and the friendship is shown as continuing in the sixth book, although Dick's role in that book is less prominent.
The six books in the series are as follows:
Editions.
The books were published with illustrated hard covers, but no dust jackets. Raymond Burns' line illustrations were done in a single color, which varies from book to book. At one time Whitman published paperback (plus paperback-sized hardback "library edition") formats of some of their book series. It is not certain whether or not Power Boys mysteries were available in these smaller formats.
The author.
Nothing is known about Mel Lyle. It is unknown whether this is his real name, a pseudonym for a single author, or even a house name for different writers—nor is it known whether he is still alive.
Many of the Whitman series used a pseudonym in place of the actual author's name. William Larson, an editor hired by Whitman in 1964, stated that if more than one book in a series was published in a year, they were almost always written by different people. Since two Power Boys books were published in both 1964 and 1965 it is likely that more than one person wrote the series.
Other Power Boys books.
There is another series of children's adventure books referred to as "Power Boys" books. Written by Woody Gelman under the name Arthur Benwood in the 1950s, they antedate Lyle's books. The brothers referred to are different characters (Ted and Steve Power instead of Jack and Chip Power), and Gelman's books would appear to be completely unrelated. Whether Lyle was influenced by this earlier series in his choice of his Power Boys' surname is unknown.

Heidi Jo Newberg

Heidi Jo Newberg (born Heidi Jo Marvin) is an American astrophysicist known for her work in understanding the structure of our Milky Way galaxy. Among her team's findings is the first-ever evidence that the Milky Way is "cannibalizing" stars from smaller galaxies. She is a founding participant in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE), and is a leader of the astrophysical MilkyWay@home distributed computing project team. She is a Professor of Physics, Applied Physics, and Astronomy at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York, USA and a Fellow of the American Physical Society.
Career.
Newberg received her bachelor's degree in Physics from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1987. She received her Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1992, working on the Berkeley Automated Supernova Search, which measured the supernova rates as a function of supernova type in Virgo-distance galaxies; and the Supernova Cosmology Project, which measured the cosmological parameters Omega and Lambda using the light curves of distant supernovae, and provided strong evidence that the expansion of our universe is accelerating. In 2007, she shared the Gruber Prize in Cosmology along with the other members of the Supernova Cosmology Project and in 2011 the group's lead won the Nobel Prize in Physics.
At Fermilab, she worked on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey starting in 1992, and the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration. She joined the faculty of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1999. Newberg is also the president of the board of trustees of the Dudley Observatory and director of the Hirsch Observatory. In 2012, she was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society "for her contributions to our understanding of the structure of the Milky Way and the universe and for the development software and hardware infrastructure for measuring and extracting meaningful information from large astronomical survey data sets."
She has published papers in diverse areas of galactic and extragalactic astronomy, including: supernova phenomenology, measuring cosmological parameters from supernovae, galaxy photometry, color selection of QSOs, properties of stars, and the structure of our galaxy.
Personal life.
Newberg was born in Washington, D.C. She is married to Lee Newberg and has four children.

Glesca Marshall

Glesca Marshall (1907–1987) was an actress and theatrical benefactor who was known primarily as the most enduring lover of Alla Nazimova, silent screen actress and a legend of her time. Glesca met Nazimova when both were cast in a production at the Civic Repertory Theater.
Glesca lived with the silent screen legend in her Sunset Boulevard property, known as the Garden of Allah, until her death in 1945.
When her success waned, Nazimova sold the property and it became a residential hotel named The Garden of Allah, where many Hollywood celebrities (including Nazimova and Marshall) lived. In spite of its notoriety and landmark status among the architecture of West Hollywood, it was torn down in 1959 and replaced with a pink strip mall housing a McDonald's, a Subway Sandwich Shop and a pizza place. This was later bulldozed to provide space for parking. The property is referenced in the 1970 song, "Big Yellow Taxi" by Joni Mitchell.
Glesca was also the longtime companion of Emily Woodruff, theatrical benefactor and main patron of the Springer Opera House in Columbus, Georgia. Emily was married to Hume Cronyn, though they never lived together and Emily insisted the marriage remain a secret.

Allen-Stevenson School

Allen-Stevenson is a private boys school for kindergarten through 9th grade in New York City, New York. It opened in 1883 and moved to its present location at 132 East 78th Street in 1924.
History.
The Allen School was founded in 1883 by Francis Bellows Allen at a home on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. Its first class enrolled only three boys. In 1885, the school moved to rented rooms at Madison Avenue and 44th Street with an enrollment of 20 boys. In 1904, Mr. Allen met Robert Alston Stevenson, a tutor, who by chance had taken a room at 509 Fifth Avenue, where the School was then located. In 1904, Mr. Allen and Mr. Stevenson joined forces and then moved to 50 East 57th Street with 100 students. By 1918 enrollment exceeded 200. The School published its first newspaper, "The Spotlight", and introduced an exercise program and team sports. 
In 1924, the School purchased two brownstones for a new schoolhouse and moved to its present location on the Upper East Side. In 1939, Mr. Allen retired at the age of 80, after 56 years of service. In 1947, Mr. Stevenson retired after 43 years of service. His son, Robert "Huck" Alston Stevenson Jr., who had taught at the School, succeeded him as Headmaster. 
In 1950, Joseph C. Rennard became Headmaster of Allen-Stevenson and served for nine years. The School introduced team sports at Randall's Island and required boys to wear navy blue blazers and gray flannel pants. In 1959, Henry Dyer Tiffany, Jr. became Headmaster until 1974. Under his leadership, a modern science lab and a paneled library, a gift from the Bell family, were added.
Allen-Stevenson's school song was composed by music teacher Rolande Schrade in 1968.
In 1974, Desmond Cole became Headmaster and served for 16 years. During his tenure, he created the Middle School division.
In 1983, The Allen-Stevenson School celebrated its first 100 years and published "The Allen-Stevenson Centennial Album." Around that time an East 77th Street addition, designed by A-S parent Alfredo De Vido, was built onto the school.
In 1990, the Board of Trustees appointed David Trower as Allen-Stevenson's seventh Headmaster. In 2001, Allen-Stevenson launched its first website to improve communication about the School.
In 2007, a total renovation-expansion of the school interior was completed, which preserved the school's Classical Revival brick and Victorian brownstone facades according to New York Landmarks Preservation Commission guidelines for the Upper East Side Historic District.
In 2008, School completes year-long celebration of 125th Anniversary. The Board of Trustees approves Allen-Stevenson and Its Community, a policy statement about inclusion and community life.
In 2009, Allen-Stevenson is twice recognized for its work on energy and the environment, first with a coveted Energy Star rating by the U.S. Department of Energy and then by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for LEED Gold Certification for Existing Buildings (EB). This makes Allen-Stevenson the very first elementary school in the United States to achieve LEED-EB Gold status.

HMS Lurcher (1912)

HMS "Lurcher" was a modified "Acheron"-class destroyer, named after the lurcher-type dog, and the fifth ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name; when new she was the fastest ship in the Royal Navy.
Construction.
Sir Alfred Yarrow maintained that it was possible to build strong, seaworthy destroyers with a speed of , and a contract for three such boats was placed with Yarrow & Company of Scotstoun, Glasgow. The ""Firedrake" Specials", "Special I class" or "Yarrow Specials" were a little larger than the rest of the class but carried the same armament. "Lurcher", "Firedrake" and "Oak" were, however, distinctive in appearance and at least 4 knots faster than the rest of their class. They all exceeded their contract speed, "Lurcher" making over ; she became part of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla.
World War One.
At the start of World War I "Lurcher" and "Firedrake" were assigned to the Eighth Submarine Flotilla under the command of Commodore Keyes, and were based at Parkeston Quay, Harwich. Both ships were employed in escorting, towing and exercising with submarines of their flotilla, and the more notable episodes are detailed below:
The Battle of Heligoland Bight.
On 26 August 1914 Commodore Keyes hoisted his broad pennant in "Lurcher", leading "Firedrake", two D-class and six E-class submarines eastwards into the North Sea. Also at sea were the destroyers of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. The plan was to place elements of the High Seas Fleet between Royal Navy surface ships and bottomed Royal Navy submarines. Unknown to Keyes and Tyrwhitt, the Admiralty had added significant reinforcements at the last minute.
Keyes' despatch reads: 
Battle was joined at 7:00 on 28 August in misty conditions. Due to lack of information about reinforcements sent by the Admiralty, great potential existed for fratricidal attacks; at 8:15 am "Firedrake" and "Lurcher" came close to attacking the cruisers "Lowestoft" and "Nottingham".
Submarines in the Baltic.
On 22 September 1914 "Firedrake" and "Lurcher" towed the submarines "E1" and "E5" towards the Skagerrak. This was the first act in a long saga that culminated in a British submarine flotilla in the Baltic.
Raid on Scarborough.
By 14 December 1914 the Admiralty had advance warning of the intended raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby through signals intelligence. Commodore Keyes was ordered to send eight submarines and his two command destroyers, "Firedrake" and "Lurcher", to take stations off the island of Terschelling to catch the German ships should they turn west into the English Channel. On 16 December, as the situation developed, the submarines were ordered to move to the Heligoland Bight in order to intercept returning German ships. They failed, although one torpedo was fired at SMS "Posen" by HMS "E11", which missed. As a last-ditch attempt to catch Hipper, the Admiralty ordered Keyes to take his two destroyers and attempt to torpedo Hipper as he returned home around 2 am. on 17 December. Keyes himself had considered this and wanted to try, but the message was delayed and failed to reach him until too late.
Search for HM Submarine "C31".
On 7 January 1915 both "Lurcher" and "Firedrake" carried out a search for the missing submarine "C31", to little avail; it transpired later that she had been mined off the Belgian coast on 4 January.
Battle of Jutland.
"Lurcher" sailed from Harwich on 30 May in company with HM Submarines "E31", "E53" and "D6" to patrol positions between Southwold and the Dutch coast, but were not involved in the Battle of Jutland, which occurred further to the East.
Collision with HM Submarine "C17".
In May 1917 "Lurcher" collided with and sank HM Submarine "C17", which was later repaired and returned to service.
Rescue of HM Submarine "C25".
At about noon on 6 July 1918 a squadron of five German seaplanes returning from a daylight raid on Lowestoft and Walmer came across HM Submarine "C25" on the surface miles east of Orford Ness. Their machine-gun attack killed the commanding officer and four other men, as well as mortally wounding the Coxswain. The steering gear, compasses and radio were all damaged. The first lieutenant, Sub Lieutenant Cobb, attracted the attention of HMS "E51" at about 12:45, and a tow was established. The seaplanes carried out further attacks on both submarines between 3:18 and 3:45pm, and it wasn't until the arrival of "Lurcher" that the enemy seaplanes were driven off.
Disposal.
"Lurcher" survived the war and was sold to J Cashmore of Newport for breaking on 9 June 1921.

Pyraminx Crystal

The Pyraminx Crystal is a dodecahedral puzzle similar to the Rubik's Cube and the Megaminx. It is manufactured and sold by Uwe Mèffert in his puzzle shop since 2008.
The puzzle was originally called the Brilic, and was first made in 2006 by Aleh Hladzilin, a member of the Twisty Puzzles Forum.
It is not to be confused with the Pyraminx, which is also invented and sold by Meffert.
History.
The Pyraminx Crystal was patented in Europe on July 16, 1987. The patent number is DE8707783U.
In late 2007, due to requests by puzzle fans worldwide, Uwe Mèffert began manufacturing the puzzle. The puzzles were first shipped in February 2008. There are two 12-color versions, one with the black body commonly used for the Rubik's Cube and its variations, and one with a white body.
The puzzle company QJ started manufacturing this puzzle in 2010, leading Meffert's Puzzles to file a lawsuit against QJ.
The Pyraminx Crystal ran out of stock fairly quickly, and became a collector's puzzle. In October 2011, a new set was created with some slight improvements to the quality.
Description.
The puzzle consists of a dodecahedron sliced in such a way that the slices meet at the center of each pentagonal face. This cuts the puzzle into 20 corner pieces and 30 edge pieces, with 50 pieces in total.
Each face consists of five corners and five edges. When a face is turned, these pieces and five additional edges move with it. Each corner is shared by 3 faces, and each edge is shared by 2 faces. By alternately rotating adjacent faces, the pieces may be permuted.
The goal of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then return it to its original state.
Solutions.
The puzzle is essentially a deeper-cut version of the Megaminx, and the same algorithms used for solving the Megaminx's corners may be used to solve the corners on the Pyraminx Crystal. The edge pieces can then be permuted by a simple 4-twist algorithm, R L' R' L, that leaves the corners untouched, in a manner similar to the Pyraminx. This can be applied repeatedly until the edges are solved.
Number of combinations.
There are 30 edge pieces with 2 orientations each, and 20 corner pieces with 3 orientations each, giving a maximum of 30!·230·20!·320 possible combinations. However, this limit is not reached because:
This gives a total of formula_1 possible combinations.
The full figure is 167 782 694 255 872 245 204 193 387 189 409 175 281 146 860 685 032 947 712 000 000 000 (roughly 1.68 unvigintillion on the short scale or 1.68 undecillion on the long scale).

Agkistrodon bilineatus russeolus

Agkistrodon bilineatus russeolus is a venomous pitviper subspecies found in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico and northern Belize.
Description.
Adults may grow to more than 100 cm in length. Gloyd and Conant (1990) reported that the largest specimens they saw were from Pisté, Yucatán: a male of 105 cm with a missing tail tip and a female of 101 cm. The average tail length is 19.2% of total body length in males and 16% in females.
Scalation includes 23 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody, 131-141 ventral scales and 46-62 subcaudal scales, most of which are paired, especially towards the tail tip.
The dorsal color pattern consists of light brown to deep reddish brown ground color overlaid with 12-18 broad brown or brownish crossbands. Laterally, these crossbands are more lightly colored in the center and usually contain one or two dark spots. The head is clearly marked on either side with two longitudinal light lines: the upper one is narrow and may be broken behind to the eye, while the lower one is wider and separated from the commissure by a dark band.
Common names.
Yucatecan cantil. Mayan names for this species are "wol-poch" (Gaige, 1936) and "uol-poch" (Schmidt and Andrews, 1936).
Geographic range.
Found in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico in the states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatán, as well as in northern Belize. The type locality given is "11.7 km north of Pisté, Yucatán, Mexico."

Prescription costs

Prescription costs are a common health care cost for many people and also the source of considerable economic hardship for some. These costs are sometimes referred to as out-of-pocket prescription costs, since for those with insurance, the total cost of their prescriptions may include expenses covered by a third party, such as an insurance company, as well as the individual. Out-of-pocket prescription costs include deductibles, co-payments, and upper limits in coverage.
United States.
In the period 1994–2004 prescription costs were the most rapidly increasing cost of health care in the United States. These increases, which averaged 12% during some years, are accounted for by increases in the number of drugs per person (treatment intensification), increases in the cost of a "market-basket" of drugs (price inflation), and increases in the use of newer drugs over older, less costly, alternatives. Overall, experts estimate that treatment intensification increased by 68% and price inflation increased by 8.3% between 1994 and 2004.
A substantial body of evidence has documented the association between high out-of-pocket costs and many types of economic and non-economic hardship. Between 20%–30% of patients in the United States report having skipped or stretched a prescription medicine during the previous 12 months because of the cost. Other patients report cutting back on payments for their utilities or food in order to afford their prescription medicines.
Patients may be embarrassed to raise their concerns, concerned that doing so may compromise their quality of care, or under the impression that there is nothing that their health care provider can do to help. Providers may also be embarrassed discussing costs, and feel too much time pressure to discuss these costs with patients.
United Kingdom.
A very large number of people in the countries of the United Kingdom get prescriptions partly or totally paid for by National Insurance from the National Health Service. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland prescriptions are free to all citizens. While in England prescribed medicines and medical supplies are free of charge to:
For others each prescribed item, regardless of nature or quantity, costs £7.85. A prescription pre-payment certificate (or PPC) can be bought for £104.00, and covers unlimited prescriptions for 12 months. Alternatively, 3-monthly PPCs may be bought for £29.10 (Prices as of 1st April 2013). PPCs are sold to the public by the NHS Business Services Authority.
Other forms of health insurance and private medical care are available, but low income does not prevent access to medical care for most conditions.
Countries where the cost of drugs is prohibitive.
In many developing countries the cost of proprietary drugs is beyond the reach of the majority of the population. There have been attempts both by international agreements and by pharmaceutical companies to provide drugs at low cost, either supplied by manufacturers who own the drugs, or manufactured locally as generic versions of drugs which are elsewhere protected by patent. Countries without manufacturing capability may import such generics.
The legal framework regarding generic versions of patented drugs is formalised in the Doha Declaration on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and later agreements.
Techniques to reduce costs.
Ways to Reduce Prescription Costs
Many pill-form drugs are produced in several different dosages. For example, a medicine may be prescribed at a 25 mg or a 50 mg dose. Some medicines can be prescribed at a higher dose and then the tablets can be split into two or more parts. High-dose pill are often much cheaper per unit weight than their low-dose counterparts. Not all pills can be split, since some come as time release capsules or require very precise dosing.
Generic drugs are much less expensive than brand-name drugs. Many people think that generics are less effective or less safe than a brand name drug, but this is an error. Once a drug is developed, it is protected by patent and sold as a brand name drug for several years, and can be sold as a generic drug or under a different brand when the patent expires.
Some drugs are available in a three-month supply at a lower unit cost than a smaller supply.
Taking a prescription medicine may become so routine that patients continue to take it even when it is no longer necessary. However, many medicines may not be needed indefinitely.
Different suppliers may have different prices. There are several government and commercial websites that will compare the prices for a given dosage of a given medication at different pharmacies.
Target followed suit in some locations soon after Wal-Mart. Many other chains have followed their lead, including CVS and Sams Club(owned by walmart). Most chains in the USA now offer some sort of discount plan. This is usually in the form of a special price list, a loyalty discount program, or price matching of other competitors schemes. Prescription pricing has become extremely competitive, with such discounts often resulting in a charge lower than the copay through a patients insurance.
There are many counterfeit medicines on the market, posing as both generic and proprietary brands. The counterfeits may be less effective than the real drug, or may have no active ingredients at all. This is a particular problem in countries with poor supervision of the pharmaceutical sector, which often also have many inhabitants with low incomes. Medicines bought over the Internet are also often found to be counterfeit. This can make saving on prescription costs risky.
While there are many mechanisms for reducing out-of-pocket prescription costs, pharmaceutical samples actually do not reduce prescription costs. Even after receiving samples, sample recipients remain disproportionately burdened by prescription costs.
For many drugs, especially brand-name antihypertensive fixed-dose medications, the clinical benefits must be balanced with patient financial burden and nonadherence during prescribing.
A study has been done on the cost effectiveness of purchasing a three-month supply, which finds that there is a quantitative cost difference when patients in the U.S. fill larger quantities of a prescription drug for a chronic condition.
Another way to perhaps reduce out-of-pocket costs is to improve physicians' access to health information technology. While physicians with high rates of IT use do not have significantly higher knowledge of drug costs, it has been suggested that health IT should be improved to make it easier for physicians to access cost information at the point of care.

La Strada (band)

La Strada (; Italian for "The Road") was a Serbian and former Yugoslav New Wave and later alternative rock band from Novi Sad.
Formed in 1979 by Slobodan Tišma, the band recorded a three-song demo which was often broadcast on Radio Novi Sad. Having changed several lineups and despite having well received live appearances, the band disbanded in 1981. Tišma with at the time La Strada members Zoran Bulatović "Bale" and Ivan Fece "Firchie" formed Luna. After the Luna disbandment, in 1984 Tišma reformed La Strada with the former La Strada bassist Danijel Stari, former Luna member Jasmina Mitrušić "Mina", guitarist Žolt Horvat and drummer Robert Radić. The lineup entered the studio during the same year, however, it was in 1987 that the eponymous debut album "La strada" was released. After the album release the band lineup had changed but the band nevertheless disbanded soon afterward. In 2004, Luna reunited and performed at the Exit festival, and during the same year Tišma performed a solo concert with a half-hour set of La Strada songs at the Pančevo Grrr! festival, with the recording from the performance being released in 2011 under the La Strada moniker.
History.
New Wave years (1979-1981).
In 1979, Slobodan Tišma (guitar, lead vocals) also known as "Deda" ("Grandpa"), a rock veteran and poet, inspired by the increasing popularity of New Wave music in Yugoslavia formed La Starada, naming it by the Federico Fellini movie "La Strada". The rest of the band consisted of Danijel Stari (bass guitar, arrangements), Boris Oslovčan "Bora" (bass guitar), Siniša Ilić "Siki" (guitar) and Dragan Nastasić "Gane" (guitar) and a temporary drummer Siniša Sekulić "Sekula". The band functioned with a studio and a live lineup as Stari did not want to perform live and bassist Oslovčan was his live replacement and drummer Sekulić also did not perform live so the band instead used a rhythm machine. The lineup made their first recordings in the Vranešević brothers studio, which consisted of three songs "On" ("Himself"), "Sat" ("Clock") and "Narcis" ("Narcicus") which were often broadcast on radio Novi Sad's shows "Yu Pop Scena" ("Yu Pop Scene") and "Novi Vidici" ("New Views") hosted by Dragan Gojković "Goja", one of the promoters of New Wave music in Novi Sad. The former two tracks appeared on the semi-official compilation album "Hokej klub Virginitas" ("Hokey Club Virginity"), released in 1988 by Ding Dong Records.
After the recording of the tracks both of the band's guitarists left the band and were replaced by Predrag Ostojić "Preža" (guitar) and Ivan Fece "Firchie" (drums). The new lineup made their first live appearance in 1980 at the Novi Sad club No. 1 as an opening act for Električni Orgazam. In May of the following year, the band performed at Subotica Youth Festival, on which New Wave bands from Serbia and Croatia had met for the first time, and at the Novi Sad Danube park handball playground, performing as an opening act for the band Film, the winners of the Subotica festival. After the performance at the Belgrade KST club in June 1981, due to a misunderstanding between the band members, bassist Oslovčan and then guitarist Ostojić left the band. After their departure Tišma remained the only guitar player and the new bassist became the former Pekinška Patka member Zoran Bulatović "Bale". At the time, the band was preparing for a three-date mini tour, including Novi Sad, Pančevo and Belgrade, organized by the Muzička Omladina concert agency, with the bands Lačni Franz, Čista Proza and Fotomodeli. Despite being well-accepted at the performances, the band ceased to exist and Tišma, Fece and Bulatović went on to form Luna.
Reformation (1984-1987).
After Luna disbanded, in 1984, Tišma and Stari, along with former Luna keyboard player and vocalist Jasmina Mitrušić "Mina", and former Gomila G and Kontraritam guitarist Žolt Horvat and drummer Robert Radić reformed La Strada. During the early 1985, in the annual "Džuboks" magazine's poll La Strada was pronounced as the greatest expectation of 1985. During the Spring of 1985, the song "Želje" ("Wishes") appeared on the various artists compilation "Ventilator 202 vol. 3". After successful performances in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Zagreb, at the Yu Rock Momenat festival, the band entered the Radio Novi Sad studio 1 in order to record the material for their debut album with Mitar Subotić, also known as Rex Illusivi, as the album producer. The entire material was recorded in a single day, which was the reason why Tišma was not content with his vocal performance as he was exhausted after watching the entire Live Aid concert broadcast the day before. The recordings were then sent to the at the time editor of PGP RTB records Petar Popović, who was interested in releasing the material. However, after the label editor had changed, the new editor Oliver Mandić declined the material.
In 1987 the music editors of Radio Novi Sad agreed to release the debut La Strada and Rex Illusivi albums in order to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the show "Randevu sa muzikom" ("A Rendezvous With Music"), and both albums were released in a limited printing of 500 copies. Unlike Luna's debut, "La strada" brought a more calmer and melodic sound, reminiscent of the 1960s psychedelic music combined with Tišma's poetry. The album featured several radio hits, including the song "Okean" ("The Ocean") for which a promotional video had been recorded. After the album release, Jasmina Mitrušić and Daniel Stari left the band and the new band members became a former Ove Sezone Vedri Tonovi guitarist Zoran Lekić "Leki" and the talented teenage bassist Ilija Vlaisavljević "Bebec". The new lineup held a live promotion of the released material before entering the studio in order to record the material for the second studio album. However, after the concert in Subotica during the late 1987, Tišma decided to disband La Strada and the material from the second studio album remained unreleased.
Post-breakup.
After La Strada disbandment, Tišma quit his musical career and released two poetry books, the first "Mairizmi" ("Manirisms") in 1995, and "Vrt kao to" ("Garden Like That") in 1997; a collection of his texts released in literary magazines during the late 1980s and early 1990s were published as "Blues Diary - Pitoma religiozna razmišljanja" ("Blues Diary - Cultivated Religious Meditations") in 2001 and he published an autobiographical novel "Urvidek" in 2005. He also wrote a libretto for a multimedia pseudo-opera "Kralj šume" ("King of the Forest") by Andraš Urban. Mitrušić finished the Musical Academy studies and moved to Italy. In 2001 she participated the "Pesme iznad istoka i zapada" ("Songs Above the East and the West"), featuring Serbian rock musicians performing music to the poems by Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović, with the written music and arrangement for the poem "Vladaj, Bože" ("Reign, God"). In 2004, the two reunited with the rest of the default Luna lineup and performed at the annual Exit festival. During the same year, Tišma held a solo concert at the Pančevo Grrr! festival and the recording from the performance was released the independent record label PMK as La Strada official bootleg album "Grrr! 2004", released on CD in a limited edition of 150 copies during the late 2011. In 2011, he won the NIN Prize for his novel "Bernardijeva soba" ("Bernardi's Room").
Legacy.
Several Serbian bands have covered La Strada songs. The Novi Sad indie rock band Boye on their 1990 album "78" in the song "Ja sam radosna" ("I am Joyful"), featuring the lyrics by Slobodan Tišma, sampled the song "Mlad i radostan". The Vrbas alternative rock band Veliki Prezir recorded a cover version of "Okean" on the 1999 cover various artists cover album "Korak napred 2 koraka nazad", the Niš punk rock band Novembar recorded a cover of "Mlad i radostan" on their 2008 cover album "Radulizam", and the Belgrade alternative music group Horkestar, consisting of a five-piece band and a thirty piece choir, covered the song "Neautentičan sneg" on their live appearances.
The song "Okean" was ranked on the No. 39 on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs, polled by the Radio B92 listeners in 2006.

Alfred Puffer

Alfred F. Puffer (1840 "-" July 1, 1875) was Deputy Collector of Customs at the United States Customs House in New York City. He was appointed to this office by Chester A. Arthur on October 1, 1873. He was formerly an entry clerk. During the American Civil War Puffer served on the staff of General Benjamin F. Butler. He was a native of Massachusetts.
Puffer died suddenly of apoplexy at his 24th Street, Manhattan, New York residence, in 1875. He left his office at the Customs House on the afternoon of June 30 and returned to his home. Feeling a warm sensation he unwisely resolved to take a bath. His wife summoned friends for assistance when he failed to respond to a knock on the bathroom door. They found him unconscious on the floor and a physician was quickly summoned. Puffer died the following morning at 9 a.m. He was survived by his wife and two children.

<doc id="18665131" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18665131" title="HMS Firedrake (1912)">
HMS Firedrake (1912)

HMS "Firedrake" was a modified "Acheron"-class destroyer, named after the firedrake of Teutonic mythology, and the sixth ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name.
Construction.
Sir Alfred Yarrow maintained that it was possible to build strong, seaworthy destroyers with a speed of , and a contract for three such boats was placed with Yarrow & Company of Scotstoun, Glasgow. The "Firedrake Specials", "Special I class" or "Yarrow Specials" were a little larger than the rest of the class but carried the same armament. "Firedrake", "Lurcher" and "Oak" were, however, distinctive in appearance and at least faster than the rest of their class. They all exceeded their contract speed, "Lurcher" making over . "Firedrake" became part of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla.
Curragh Incident.
During the Curragh Incident in the spring of 1914, "Firedrake" was despatched to Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire in the Republic of Ireland) in order to preserve communications between Lieutenant General Sir Arthur Paget in Dublin and the British Government in London. She left Southampton at 10:30pm on 19 March, making the passage in record time. The Unionists suspected that the naval movements were part of a plot to subdue Ulster, and "Firedrake's" captain, Lieutenant Commander B W Barrow, was ordered to report to Paget's Headquarters in civilian clothes.
Discomfort in the British Army with possible military action within Ireland was to some extent mirrored in the Royal Navy. In "Firedrake", Engineer Lieutenant Ranken informed his captain "that I had signed the British Covenant and that I should be no party to any aggressive move against Ulster if that were the intention in sending us to Kingstown". Had General Paget, he declared, "joined for passage during my regime only one course was open to me - to decline to be a party to propelling the ship". Lieutenant Commander Barrow did not share his principles, and Ranken was relieved by another officer on 22 March. On 2 April all naval forces, including "Firedrake", were withdrawn for Easter leave, with no intention to return them. Although the Royal Navy soon returned to prevent gun-running to the Ulster Volunteers, "Firedrake" does not appear to have taken part.
World War One.
Landing of the BEF.
From August 1914 the British and French Navies attempted to seal the English Channel against German Naval attack; "Firedrake" and 12 submarines formed the north-eastern line. No transports carrying the British Expeditionary Force were sunk, although the German Navy made little or no use of submarines against non-military ships at this stage of the war.
According to the despatches of Commodore Keyes, 
The Battle of Heligoland Bight.
On 26 August 1914 Commodore Keyes hoisted his broad pennant in "Lurcher", leading "Firedrake", two D-class and six E-class submarines eastwards into the North Sea. Also at sea were the destroyers of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. The plan was to place elements of the High Seas Fleet between Royal Navy surface ships and bottomed Royal Navy submarines. Unknown to Keyes and Tyrwhitt, the Admiralty had added significant reinforcements at the last minute.
Keyes' despatch reads: 
Battle was joined at 7:00 on 28 August in misty conditions. Due to lack of information about reinforcements sent by the Admiralty, great potential existed for fratricidal attacks; at 8:15 am "Firedrake" and "Lurcher" came close to attacking the cruisers "Lowestoft" and "Nottingham".
Submarines in the Baltic.
On 22 September 1914 "Firedrake" and "Lurcher" towed the submarines "E1" and "E5" towards the Skagerrak. This was the first act in a long saga that culminated in a British submarine flotilla in the Baltic.
Raid on Scarborough.
By 14 December 1914 the Admiralty had advance warning of the intended raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby through signals intelligence. Commodore Keyes was ordered to send eight submarines and his two command destroyers, "Lurcher" and "Firedrake", to take stations off the island of Terschelling to catch the German ships should they turn west into the English Channel. On 16 December, as the situation developed, the submarines were ordered to move to the Heligoland Bight in order to intercept returning German ships. They failed, although one torpedo was fired at SMS "Posen" by HMS "E11", which missed. As a last-ditch attempt to catch Hipper, the Admiralty ordered Keyes to take his two destroyers and attempt to torpedo Hipper as he returned home around 2 am. on 17 December. Keyes himself had considered this and wanted to try, but the message was delayed and failed to reach him until too late.
Search for Submarine C31.
On 7 January 1915 both "Firedrake" and "Lurcher" carried out a search for the missing British submarine "C31", to little avail; it transpired later that she had been mined off the Belgian coast on 4 January.
Capture of "UC-5".
On 27 April 1916 the German Navy submarine "UC-5" under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Ulrich Mohrbutter ran aground on Shipwash Shoal in position . "Firedrake" captured the U-boat at 1:00pm relatively intact; apart from some damage incurred in the grounding, the crew had taken measures to damage instruments and equipment, including firing small arms at them, and seven destruction charges had caused several holes in the pressure hull. "UC-5" was towed to Harwich and placed in a dry dock, where she was examined and reconditioned. She was displayed at Temple Pier on the Thames in London, and later moved to New York, where she was displayed in Central Park. "Firedrake's" captain, Commander Aubrey Thomas Tillard was mentioned in despatches for his part in the capture.
Sinking of "UC-51".
Some sources state that "UC-51" commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Hans Galster was sunk by "Firedrake" on 13 November or 17 November 1917, either off Harwich or Start Point. It seems most likely that "UC-51" was mined in the English Channel and lies in position off Start Point.
Disposal.
"Firedrake" survived the war and was sold to J Smith for breaking on 10 October 1921.
HMS "Firedrake" in fiction.
"The Man Who Won the War", a 1936 short story by Robert Buckner, featured Roger Bradman as the commanding officer of "Firedrake" who, in the early days of World War I, lands on the Belgian coast and devises a plan that succeeds in stopping the German Army from reaching Paris. It was first printed in "Atlantic Monthly" in February 1936, and then reprinted in "Reader's Digest" (April 1936) and "The Best American Short Stories of 1937".

<doc id="18665212" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18665212" title="G.V. Series">
G.V. Series

The G.V. Series (perhaps for "Grabation Victor") were a series of 10 inch 78 rpm Gramophone records produced in Europe and the United States from 1933 to 1958, and exported (or repressed on site) to colonial Tropical Africa. They are credited with introducing Afro-Cuban music into modern African popular culture. The resulting re-interpretations influenced the creation of several genres of African popular music.
The Series.
Over 250 titles (double sided records) were produced in the G.V. Series. The records were launched by the British EMI company's His Master's Voice label in 1933, in part because of shrinking demand during the Great Depression. In the 1940s, HMV reached agreement with other companies, such as RCA Victor to share the royalties of their artists in the production of G.V. Series recordings. Thereafter local distributors were able to request, or press themselves, any of the back catalog of these companies for relatively low cost in Africa, making the records affordable to African listeners for the first time.
At the same time in West Africa (what became Nigeria and Ghana, specifically) EMI was recording and releasing Sakara, Juju and Apala music on 78rpm discs in the "Parlophone B", "HMV JL", "HMV JZ" and "Decca WA/GWA/NGA" series (1947–52), as well as HMV owned local labels, such as Ghana's Taymani Special. While there were also domestic record producers beginning to appear in Anglophone West Africa, Francophone Central African music was based on the twin poles of small domestic labels of the 1940s and 50s, and the Latin music supplied by the G.V. Series records and later competitors from Pathé Marconi and Decca. Anglophone West Africa also had twin advantages of having had access to domestic recording and the distribution across West Africa of these recordings by the HMV owned Zonophone label of African music from 1928.
Cuban music in Africa.
While the G.V. Series drew on a wide back catalogue of music, they are best known as the first exposure many Africans had to Afro-Cuban music (specifically Son and Son montuno). Some musicians of the era still refer to these songs not by the Spanish language titles but by the G.V. numbers of their records.
Nine initial G.V. records were released in 1933, drawn from EMI's back catalogue of '""general ethnic"" or ""Spanish"" recordings, with G.V. 1 being ""The Peanut Vendor"" by Don Azpiazu & his Havana Casino Orchestra, recorded New York City, 13 May 1930. Of particular note were Cuban artists such as Son combo Sexteto Habanero, Trio Matamoros, Don Azpiazú, Abelardo Valdés, Antonio Machin, as well as big band leader Xavier Cugat, originally recorded in the United States for the American market.
These records spawned some of the most successful modern musical styles West Africa, Central Africa, and East Africa. The most notable of these styles is Congolese Rumba (""Soukous"") which developed in Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (modern Kinshasa, DRC) in the 1940s and 50s. The guitar styles of Highlife music in British colonial West Africa were also highly influenced by these records. African guitar playing in general, and the electric guitar in particular, was popularised in part by the music distributed in the G.V. Series records. The music of East Africa was also influenced by the G.V. series, sold through East African Music Stores in Nairobi as its agents in Lourenço Marques and Dar-es-Salaam. But here too, the Cuban musics of the G.V. series quickly had to complete with domestic music produced by EMI and specialist labels like Odeon Swahili.
