Pyramus and Thisbe (opera)

Pyramus and Thisbe is a "mock opera" by the German-born composer John Frederick Lampe on the story of Pyramus and Thisbe. It was first performed at Covent Garden Theatre, London on 25 January 1745. The anonymous libretto (possibly the work of the composer or Henry Carey) is based on Richard Leveridge's "The Comickal Masque of Pyramus and Thisbe" (1716), itself inspired by the "play within a play" in Act V of William Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream". 
This was the last of Lampe's operas, and was a much-needed success after a difficult period for musicians in the London theatre. In 1741 the revolution in Shakespearean acting initiated by Macklin and Garrick diverted attention away from music, and Lampe produced no new work in the major theatres for four years. Pyramus returns to the vein of burlesque that he mined in "The Dragon of Wantley" (1737), his first popular success; it ridicules Italian-style opera and opera singers rather than Shakespeare's plays and players. The onstage audience, originally Duke Theseus and his entourage, consists of Mr Semibrief (the impresario) and two gentlemen, one of whom has experienced Italian opera at first hand on the grand tour; they interject facetious spoken comments as the all-sung opera proceeds. The story follows Shakespeare closely: the Wall (tenor) sports a chink through which Pyramus (tenor) and Thisbe (soprano) arrange to meet 'at Ninny's tomb'. Thisbe arrives first and is frightened away by the Lion (bass), who sings a splendid roaring aria. After the Moon (tenor) has sung a lyrical Arne-like number, Pyramus appears, fears the worst and stabs himself 'like a hero in Italian opera, to very good time and tune'; Thisbe follows suit. But they are revived by Mr Semibrief in time to sing the epilogue. Lampe's music is charming and largely deadpan, though there are the standard Handelian rage and revenge arias. The full score (London, 1745/ R 1988) omits the secco recitatives, a dance and the last chorus.

Karl Josef von Bachmann

Karl Joseph Anton Leodegar Freiherr von Bachmann (3 March 1734 – 3 September 1792) was a Swiss aristocrat and soldier.
Family and Early life.
Karl Joseph von Bachmann was born in an aristocratic Swiss family from Nafels. His father was Marechal de Camp (Field Marshal) Karl Leonhard von Bachmann and his brother was the future General Niklaus Franz von Bachmann. As had many of his ancestors and relatives he entered the service of the French King as an officer of the Swiss regiments of France.
Military career in France.
In 1749 Bachmann entered French service as a cadet. He was soon promoted to Ensign in the company of his father (in the Regiment de Castella) and in 1750 was promoted to Captain of the Grenadiers of the same regiment. In 1756 he became commander of two companies of the Regiment. In 1762 he was promoted to Major of the Regiment Waldner von Freudenstein.
During this period he fought in various engagements of the Seven Years War.
In 1764 Bachmann became Lieutenant Colonel and was transferred to the Regiment of the Swiss Guard, where he kept his rank though officially he was Major of the Regiment. In 1768 he obtained the rank of Brigadier and in 1780 that of Marechal de Camp, while still serving as Major of the Swiss Guards.
In 1778 Bachmann received the Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis. In 1792 he became also the owner of a company of the Swiss Guard Regiment.
Death.
Major Bachmann was in command of the Swiss Guard during the 10 August Insurrection, when revolutionaries stormed the palace of the Tuileries. He escorted King Louis XVI and the Royal Family to the National Assembly where they sought refuge.
Arrested by the revolutionaries he was accused of treason for ordering the Swiss Guard to resist the storming of the royal palace and thereby offending the "Majesty of the People". Bachmann refused to acknowledge the tribunal which was trying him, as the Swiss soldiers in French service were entitled to be tried by their own courts. His trial was interrupted in the late afternoon of 2 September 1792 when the September Massacres of hundreds of political prisoners took place at the Conciergerie and Abbaye prisons. A lynch mob invaded the courtroom where Major Bachmann and other Swiss Guards were being tried before the official Tribunal of 17 August. The crowd retreated when ordered to clear the room by the presiding judges and Bachmann "passed through their shambles unharmed on his way to the scaffold".
Bachmann was then sentenced to death, and guillotined on 3 September 1792. He stepped on to the scaffold still wearing the red uniform of the Swiss Guard and his countenance struck those who watched so much that he was remembered by the French poet Lamartine in one of his works.
The Dying Lion in Lucerne.
Bachmann's name is also engraved on the monument of the "Dying Lion" in Lucerne, by Bertel Thorvaldsen, where he figures as second on the list of the fallen.

Esem

Esem is the stage name of Georgi Hristov Marinov, a Bulgarian electronic music artist, (born 10 February 1979). Esem is formerly known as the tracker musician StereoMan, a member of the demoscene group NOiSE.
Musical career.
Georgi Marinov first got involved in composing electronic music and the demoscene in the late 1990s, through the work of Brothomstates and Lackluster among others. After a 5-year netlabel membership in NOiSE ("New Objectives in Sound Exploration) Marinov was signed up to deFocus records for his first vinyl single - "Ikae", and debut album "Enveloped". Thus becoming the first contemporary Bulgarian electronic music artist to have released a music record on vinyl.
After releasing his second album "Serial Human" commercially on Merck Records, Esem moved to London where he produced the material for "Scateren" - his third album. "Scateren" was released as a free Creative Commons-licensed download on Kahvi, and quickly became one of the label's most downloaded titles.
In 2007 parts of "Scateren" were licensed and subsequently released by Nintendo as background music to the Nintendo DS game "Theta", and as downloadable ringtones (complementary to the game title). The original album remained under Creative Commons.
Esem is a regular guest on the Lithuanian label Sutemos's "Intelligent Toys" series, featured alongside Vladislav Delay, Digitonal, Maps and Diagrams, Ulrich Schnauss, and others.
Methods.
Esem employs both trackers and Digital Audio Workstation software for his work. Most of his recent music was produced using software synthesizers and Apple Inc.'s Logic Pro sequencer. He is a firm believer that the software employed does not matter.
He is also largely active on the internet, with profiles in social networking sites such as Last.fm, Flickr, and Facebook. Much of his work outside of music involves computer programming and web development.
He is the author of an Adium soundset, called "Minus Bells".
Live performances.
Although Marinov does not often play live, he has since 2000 played a small number of gigs in Europe including venues in the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden, and Russia, as well as club gigs and festivals in Bulgaria.
Name.
Esem is a distorted abbreviation of S, M - the capital letters of his past demoscene alias - StereoMan.

Pimpinone

Pimpinone, TWV 21:15, is a comic opera by the German composer Georg Philipp Telemann with a libretto by Johann Philipp Praetorius. Its full title is "Die Ungleiche Heirat zwischen Vespetta und Pimpinone oder Das herrsch-süchtige Camer Mägden" ("The Unequal Marriage Between Vespetta and Pimpinone or The Domineering Chambermaid"). The work is described as a "Lustiges Zwischenspiel" ("comic intermezzo") in three parts. It was first performed at the Theater am Gänsemarkt, Hamburg on 27 September 1725 as light relief between the acts of Telemann's adaptation of Handel's opera seria "Tamerlano". "Pimpinone" was highly successful and pointed the way forward to later intermezzi, particularly Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's "La serva padrona". 
__NOTOC__
Plot.
Vespetta the chambermaid wheedles her way into marrying her employer, old Pimpinone. Once married she shows her waspish nature (the name Vespetta means "little wasp") and completely dominates her husband.

Renard R.36

The Renard R.36 was a Belgian all-metal fighter aircraft designed to replace the Fairey Firefly II within the Belgian Air Force. Designed to improve on the Renard Epervier, which was never adopted by the Belgian government, the prototype R.36 first flew on 5 November 1937. Following testing the R.36 was approved by the Belgian Air Force in late 1938, with 40 aircraft provisionally ordered, to be delivered in two years. However, on 17 January 1939 the prototype, "OO-ARW", crashed near Nivelles, killing pilot Lt. Visconte Eric de Spoelberg. The official investigation was inconclusive, no evidence of material failure being discovered, with the most probable causes being radio equipment coming loose during a high-G manoeuver, jamming the controls, or the pilot becoming incapacitated. The airframe had accumulated 75:30 hours flight time. The order was then dropped in favour of licence production of the Hawker Hurricane by SABCA.

Cement Accelerator is an admixture for the use in concrete, mortar, rendering or screeds. The addition of Cement Accelerator speeds the setting time and thus cure time starts earlier. This allows concrete to be placed in winter without the worry of frost damage 
Typical materials used for acceleration are Ca(NO3)2 and NaNO3. CaCl2 has been very popular, but due to its reinforcement corroding behaviour the use is not recommended any more and in many cases prohibited.

Felipe Cardeña

Felipe Cardeña is a very well known artist that nobody has ever seen. The newspaper "Corriere della Sera" wrote on Maj 2008: "We only thing we know is that he was born in Balaguer, Spain, 29 years ago. The rest of the information we have regarding Felipe Cardeña, mysterious artist Banksy's style, is fragmentary and contradictory. His floreal collages – whose technique was probably developed in jail – and his floreal stickers appear everywhere: his slogan is Power Flower"(1). Maybe behind Felipe Cardeña's identity there is a collective of artists with differents backgrounds and origins, probably related to the street art world. Certanly one of the first exhibitions where he appeared was in the 2005 in Milan, Miracolo a Milano (2), by acting as the statue of St John the Headless, and where he stood without a single movement for six hours. In 2007, he put the pirates flag right at the entrance of the exhibit Sweet Art Street Art as the symbol of street artists who fought and won over the Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea, in Milan. Eventually, his art work was stolen by one of the visitors. Since the end of 2007 he started the project "Power Flower". In 2008 Felipe Cardena prepared a gigantic panel to be shown at the street art exhibit Scala Mercalli, dedicated to the Dalai Lama. "Free Tibet Free Flowers" was written on the panel in capital letters. in 2009 he exposed a giant panel with the portrait of Che Guevara "floreciente" in L'Avana, Cuba, for the Arte Mas 2009, Festival Internacional de arte y Literatura joven. His most recent art work is based on the idea of “surprise” and “astonishment”: large – sometimes monumental – colorful flower compositions, eccentric collages, unusual shapes, strongly exaggerated images underlining the themes of religion and cultural diversity, a mixture of human and natural forms.
Vittorio Sgarbi wrote that "Felipe Cardeña proposes the amateur technique of collage pursuing a repetitive and obsessive iconography as the daily rosary of a cloistered nun". (3)

Reg Ellis (Australian sportsman)

Reginald Newnham "Reg" Ellis (22 February 1891 – 26 May 1959) was an Australian sportsman who played first-class cricket for Victoria and Australian rules football in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Ellis, a defender, played 53 games in the VFL, all but one of them for St Kilda from 1913 to 1915. He had been recruited from Sydney and participated in St Kilda's 1913 VFL Grand Final loss to Fitzroy. In 1920, after not playing at all during the war, Ellis returned to the league and signed up with Melbourne. He made just one appearance for the club.
His cricket career began over seven years after he played his last VFL game and he was aged 36 when he made his first-class debut against Tasmania. The Victorian opening pair in the first innings of Fred Baring and Basil Onyons were also league footballers as was their wicket-keeper Stuart King. Ellis came in at three and made just the one run before being dismissed. He made amends in the second innings with a century. His even hundred allowed Victoria to chase their fourth innings target of 182 with five wickets in hand.
Ellis went on to represent Victoria in the 1928/29 and 1929/30 Sheffield Shield seasons. He finished with 355 runs from his seven first-class matches at an average of 29.58. His only other century came in a Shield encounter against Queensland at the MCG in 1928 when he made an unbeaten 107. Ellis also took three wickets in his career, including dismissing Test player Alan Fairfax.

Journey Through a Small Planet

Journey Through a Small Planet is a novel written by Emanuel Litvinoff.
Synopsis.
In "Journey Through a Small Planet" (1972), the writer Emanuel Litvinoff recalls his working-class Jewish childhood in the East End of London: a small cluster of streets right next to the city, but worlds apart in culture and spirit. With vivid intensity Litvinoff describes the overcrowded tenements of Brick Lane and Whitechapel, the smell of pickled herring and onion bread, the rattle of sewing machines and chatter in Yiddish. He also relates stories of his parents, who fled from Russia in 1914, his experiences at school and a brief flirtation with Communism. Unsentimental, vital and almost dream like, this is a masterly evocation of a long-vanished world.

Carlo McCormick

Carlo McCormick is a culture critic and curator living in New York City. He is the author of numerous books, monographs and catalogues on contemporary art and artists.
Pedagogic Activity.
McCormick lectures and teaches extensively at universities and colleges around the United States on popular culture and art. His writing has appeared in Aperture, Art in America, Art News, Artforum, Camera Austria, High Times, Spin (magazine), Tokion, Vice and other magazines. McCormick is Senior Editor of Paper (magazine).
Curatorial Activity.
McCormick was guest curator of The Downtown Show: the New York Art Scene from 1974 to 1984 (in consultation with Lynn Gumpert, and Marvin J. Taylor) that was held at NYU’s Grey Art Gallery and Fales Library.
This exhibition examined the rich cross-section of artists and activities that coexisted and often overlapped in Lower Manhattan between 1974 and 1984. Emerging out of the deflated optimism of the Summer of Love (and energized by the enactment of the Loft Laws that made it legal for artists to live in downtown New York's industrial spaces) the Downtown no wave scene attracted painters, sculptors, photographers, musicians, performance art, filmmakers, and writers who could afford the then-low rent lofts and Lower East Side tenement apartments.
The show traveled to the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (May 20 to September 3, 2006) and the Austin Museum of Art, in Austin, Texas (November 18, 2006, to January 28, 2007). It was chosen as first place winner by The International Association of Art Critics/USA (AICA USA) for best thematic show in New York City in 2005-2006.

Avro 521

The Avro 521 was a British two-seat fighter first flown late in 1915, based on the 504. Only a prototype of the Avro 521 was built. It was powered by a 110 hp (80 kW) Clerget engine, with a provision for a .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun in the rear cockpit. 
Operational history.
The prototype underwent trials with the RFC in early 1916, and 25 aircraft were subsequently ordered. However, this contract was cancelled, and there is no evidence of any other Avro 521s being built. The prototype crashed at Central Flying School Upavon on 21 September 1916, killing pilot Lieutenant W.H.S. Garnett.

Youthful Spirit

Youthful Spirit is an award winning Gospel music Choir from Churchill Community School, North Somerset, England. It consists of a rotating cast of students at the school from Year 8 to Year 13. The only entry requirement is "Students with a passion for music". It was born by Churchill Music! with the support of Alison Cooper and all the other music staff, and has since become an international gospel choir. 
About.
Founded in 1998 by Alison Cooper, Head of Music at the school, Youthful Spirit has a wide repertoire ranging from Swahili and A cappella to the likes of Stevie Wonder, Cyndi Lauper and other pop influenced songs. The choir create CDs of their work: "... You Caught Me In the Groove", 2000, "Sweet Rhythms", 2003, "Song of the Sunrise", 2006, "Blessed", 2008,"Glorious", 2009 and most recently, "Let The Sun Shine", 2013. The CDs were originally recorded in Weston College and Worle Community School until the 2006 "Song of the Sunrise" which was recorded in the school with the construction of the new Performing Arts building and Recording Studio. "Song of the Sunrise" was recorded at the school and the local St John the Baptist Church. The choir go on European Tours, generally to mark the release of a new CD such as the "Song of the Sunrise Tour" in 2006 and the "Blessed Tour" in 2008.
From September 2009, the setup of the choir is set to change. Musical Director Alison Cooper wants the choir to have more say in the choirs repertoire and split the mass choir into smaller groups for rehearsal purposes. It was announced on Friday September 11 that a new CD was to be made by the end of the year. The CD is to be called "Glorious" and will include songs such as Whitney Houston's I Go To The Rock and Edwin Hawkins' I Heard The Voice.
In 2011, the choir were asked to perform at St Georges, Bristol once again. For a new year, and a new feel to the choir, they branched into more popular music, including Take That's Rule the World and Labrinth's Let the Sun Shine, which proved to be extremely popular. This new, revamped repertoire was taken on tour to Austria in July 2011 and again in July 2013.
Tour.
The choir go on tour to various destinations in Europe, generally to mark the release of a new CD. As of 2008, they have been to Athens, Greece; Hildesheim, Germany; Carinthia, Austria; and Venice, Italy. They have also performed at the Royal Albert Hall, London.
Some of the venues at which the choir have performed include Terra Mystica, Austria (a venue inside a mountain), The Playhouse, Weston-super-Mare and St Nicholas Cathedral, Prague. They have also performed at Wells Cathedral, Somerset for the 5 Bishops attending the Lambeth Conference in 2008 and St George's Church, Brandon Hill, Bristol in a Gospel evening in March 2009.
By the end of 2008, it was looking unlikely that a tour in 2009 would happen, due to the economic climate. However, ultimately the tour went ahead travelling by coach to "keep costs down", visiting Carinthia, Austria once again in venues in Murau, Lake Ossiach, and Feistritz im Rosental. The tour was a huge success with nearly every concert a sell-out.
The 2010 tour went to Hildesheim in Germany. It's been the second time that the choir performed there.
The concerts took place on the historic market square.
A trip to Berlin with a visit in the Bundestag and a performance in the St. Mathilde Church in Laatzen was included.
Youthful Spirit have toured Carinthia, Austria, twice more since the 2009 tour, in July 2011 and again in July 2013, this time in support of the "Let The Sun Shine" CD.

La fée Urgèle

La fée Urgèle, ou Ce qui plaît aux dames ("The Fairy Urgèle, or What Pleases Women") is an "opéra comique" (specifically a "comédie mêlée d'ariettes") in four acts by the composer Egidio Duni. The libretto, by Charles-Simon Favart, is based on Voltaire's "Ce qui plaît aux dames" and Chaucer's "The Wife of Bath's Tale". 
Performance history.
The opera was first performed at the Théâtre Royal de la Cour at Fontainebleau on 26 October 1765. The elaborate medieval staging cost 20,000 livres according to Grimm in his "Correspondance littéraire". It was revived at the Comédie-Italienne on 4 December 1765 and given over 100 times in the following years, popularizing medieval settings for other operas such as Richard Coeur-de-lion and Aucassin et Nicolette.
Synopsis.
Robert is a knight imprisoned in a 7th-century French court controlled by women. He must answer the question: what gives the most pleasure to women? He is obliged to agree to marry an old woman who is then transformed into the beautiful Marton.

ESyPred3D

ESyPred3D is an automated homology modeling program. The method gets the benefit of the increased alignment performances of an alignment strategy that uses neural networks. Alignments are obtained by combining, weighting and screening the results of several multiple alignment programs. The final three-dimensional structure is built using the modeling package MODELLER.
Steps.
The usual four steps of homology modeling are executed:
Template selection.
The template is the first PDB hit found by using maximum four PSI-BLAST iterations in the NCBI nr data bank.
Sequence alignment.
The query and the template sequences are aligned using a consensus alignment method. Different multiple sequence alignments are built using different alignment programs on two sets of sequences including the query and the template sequence.
The consensus method is using a neural network to find the best aligned residues and analyzing all possible combinations using a dead end elimination algorithm.
Model generation and loop modeling.
The final 3D model is build from the target-template alignment and the 3D structure of the template using MODELLER. MODELLER is also used to build the missing loops.
Model assessment.
The final model is assessed using the PROCHECK program.
Usage.
ESypred3D has been evaluated in EVA, CASP and CAFASP.
ESyPred3D is part of some meta-servers: Meta-PP, Genetegrate and PredictProtein.
The ESyPred3D web server is running about 2600 predictions per month.

Avro 530

The Avro 530 was a British two-seat fighter biplane designed in 1916 to compete with the Bristol F.2A. The plane itself was designed in 1916, but not flown until July 1917. It was of wooden construction with fabric skinning, powered by a 200 hp (150 kW) Hispano-Suiza engine.
Operational history.
Although performance of the Avro 530 proved to be good, it did not improve sufficiently on the Bristol F.2A and as such no production orders were issued. Another issue was that priority for the Hispano-Suiza engines which powered the 530 was being given to the S.E.5a. In 1918, a second 530 was fitted with a 200 hp (150 kW) Sunbeam Arab engine, but development was subsequently abandoned.

Spanish submarine C-3

C-3 was a C-class submarine of the Spanish Republican Navy. "C-3" was built by Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval (SECN) in Cartagena, Spain, launched 20 February 1929, and commissioned on the 4 May 1929. She took part in the Spanish Civil War on the government side before being sunk by the German submarine "U-34" on 12 December 1936.
Pre-war.
On 14 September 1931, "C-3" successfully tested Génova's submarine rescue chamber (similar to the McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber) in Escombreras inlet. Developed by "Capitán de Corbeta" (Lieutenant Commander) Arturo Génova Torrecuellar, this was subsequently installed in all C-class submarines as a portable unit, as well as the subsequent D-class, which used a fixed unit.
Civil War.
At the start of the Civil War, 18 July 1936, "C-3" was in Cartagena harbour, under command of "Teniente de Navío" (Lieutenant) Rafael Viniegra González. He was ordered to sortie from Cartagena in company with submarines "B-6", "Isaac Peral" (C-1), "C-4" and "C-6", bound for the Gibraltar Strait. In command of the flotilla was the "Capitán de Fragata" (Commander) Francisco Guimerá Bosch, the mission was to blockade the strait and interdict transport of rebel troops from North Africa to the Iberian Peninsula. They took a patrol line along the Andalusian coast
Only two days into the operation, on 20 July, the flotilla entered Málaga harbour, where Guimerá, Viniegra (along with "C-3"'s executive officer), and the rest of the flotilla's senior officers, with the exception of "Isaac Peral" (C-1)'s skipper, "Capitán de Corbeta" Lara, were relieved and transferred to the prison ship "Monte Toro" because they were considered sympathizers of the rebels.
Next morning, 21 July, "C-3", joined by "B-6", departed Málaga bound for Tangier to protect the oil tanker "Ophir". On 27 July, all destroyers and submarines in Málaga deployed around Cadiz to intercept a Nationalist convoy that proved to be a decoy. Then she, "C-2", and "C-6" received instructions to form a patrol arc in front of Ceuta harbour to prevent the entrance of the cruiser "Almirante Cervera", which had left Ferrol bound for the Gibraltar Strait.
1 August, at Málaga, "C-3" took on remaining anti-aircraft ammunition and torpedoes before "C-4" departed for Cartagena for minor repairs
Two weeks later, on 15 August, "C-3" sailed for the Cantabric Sea with the "C-6", returned to Cartagena with average. She repeated the voyage 25 August, in company with "C-4" and "C-5", where "C-3" and "C-6" jointly attempted to locate and sink the battleship "España" and "Almirante Cervera", without success. She also aided in the search for transports bringing weapons to Bilbao.
"C-3" returned to the Mediterranean Sea on 2 October, arriving in Málaga 8 October.
On 12 December 1936, "C-3" was running surfaced 4 nm (7½ km) southeast of Málaga. In the conning tower was her commander, "Alférez de Navío" (Ensign) Antonio Arbona Pastor, and a merchant navy pilot attached to the Republican Navy. At 14:19, there was a sudden explosion on her starboard bow, and "C-3" disappeared. The explosion was observed by the coastguard vessel "Xauen", lying two miles (3.7 km) inshore of "C-3", and the fishing boats "Joven Antonio" and "Joven Amalia", about the same distance away. Despite their proximity, the only survivors were the pilot, García Viñas, and two of "C-3"'s sailors, Isidoro de la Orden Ibáñez and Asensio Lidón Jiménez, who had been topside dumping trash and garbage.
According to the Germans, "C-3" was torpedoed by "U-34", commanded by "Kapitänleutnant" Harald Grosse, as part of Operation Ursula; the Republican version differs. For this action, Grosse received the "Goldenes Spanienkreuz" (Spanish golden cross).
Over the next few days, Republican authorities attempted to locate "C-3", but only found a large oil slick. The position was marked by buoy, but no rescue attempted, and it is likely there were none left alive aboard. Subsequently, when Málaga fell to the Nationalists, "C-3" was forgotten. The Nationalists, in an attempt to conceal the acquisition of two Italian "Archimede"-class submarines—"General Mola" (ex-) and "General Sanjurjo", ex-)—renamed them "C-3" and "C-5", claiming "C-3" was raised and recommissioned by the Nationalist Navy. This maneuver was unsuccessful; the Italian boats bore distinct structural differences. "C-3" was stricken by ministerial order on 31 July 1941.
Wreck found.
In 1997, Malaga's lawyer Antonio Checa discovered the remains of a shipwreck, He sensed it was "C-3". Despite several dives by an ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) with video camera, it proved impossible to positively identify the wreck, owing to bad visibility.
In October 1998, The Spanish Navy sent the rescue ship "Mar Rojo" (A-20 ) with a navy dive team. They identified wreck as C-3, at the position . They found her hull had broken in two. One section 8 meters from bow was separated from the rest. Both parts remain in a sand plain, separated by a few meters, the biggest upright, the smaller inverted.

Scott C Shephard

Scott C Shephard (born 19/09/1979) is a British music industry executive and consultant. He has worked with artists such as dance act De Nada and Motown Records recording artist Val Young.
Scott got his start in music working for the U.S. and U.K. divisions of Death Row Records, the rap label once home to Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. His work marketing releases such as the Dysfunktional Family (soundtrack), led to him becoming personal publicist for artists on the label including Danny Boy, and Jewell.
In 2003, Scott was introduced to music producer DJ Slip of Comptons Most Wanted, which segued into an involvement with Los Angeles, California based record label IV Life Records and Mafia IV Life car club, founded by Ladell Rowles (a.k.a. Del Dog).
Scott was New Media Manager for Dynasty/C.O.B. Records in 2004, a new imprint launched by rapper Crooked I. Alongside Crooked I, Scott designed, marketed and developed platforms such as Dynasty TV, a digital video show that showcased music and events, and WestcoastDynasty.com, a web community which distributed music including the monumental Hip-Hop Weekly series. Crooked I soon became one of the leading faces emerging from musics ‘Digital Era’ and they're innovative marketing strategies were rewarded when music publication VIBE magazine labelled Crooked I and Jay Electronica as ”Internet Guerrillas" on the cover of their August 2008 issue, with an article discussing the Hip-Hop Weekly series and his approach to marketing on the internet. Crooked I mentioned Scott at the end of his song "The Finale (Week 52)". Crooked I is now signed to Eminem's Shady Records as a member of the American hip hop supergroup Slaughterhouse.
In October 2008, Scott was appointed President of Global Music Group Europe, the Europe Division of New York-based record label, Global Music Group. The company purchased historic hip-hop label Death Row Records for $25 million on June 25, 2008.

Liz Malia

Elizabeth A. "Liz" Malia (born September 30, 1949) is an American politician from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. A Democrat, she has served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives since March 1998. She represents the Eleventh Suffolk district, which includes parts of the Boston neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, Roxbury and Dorchester.
In the legislature, she serves as Chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse. 
Malia graduated from Boston College in 1971 with a BA in Education and English, returning in 1989 to complete the graduate certificate program at the Center for Women in Politics and Government. She worked in human services, healthcare, community organizing and labor advocacy before becoming chief of staff to state representative John E. McDonough in 1990.
In late 1997, McDonough retired mid-term to take up an associate professorship at Brandeis University and Malia jumped into the race to succeed him. She won the special preliminary election easily and went on to win 67% of the special general election vote. She was re-elected in November 1998 and has won biennial re-election ever since.
Malia, a lesbian, co-founded the Bay State Gay and Lesbian Democrats in the mid-1980s. She is one of seven openly LGBT members of the Massachusetts General Court, alongside Representatives Carl Sciortino (D–Medford), Sarah Peake (D–Provincetown), Kate Hogan (D–Stow), Cheryl Coakley-Rivera (D–Springfield) and Denise Andrews (D–Orange), as well as Senator Stan Rosenberg (D–Amherst).

<doc id="18615870" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18615870" title="Unified Model">
Unified Model

The Unified Model is a Numerical Weather Prediction and climate modeling software suite originally developed by the United Kingdom Met Office, and now both used and further developed by many weather-forecasting agencies around the world. The Unified Model gets its name because a single model is used across a range of both timescales (nowcasting to centennial) and spatial scales (convective scale to climate system earth modelling). The models are grid-point based, rather than wave based, and are run on a variety of supercomputers around the world. The Unified Model atmosphere can be coupled to a number of ocean models. At the Met Office it is used for the main suite of Global Model, North Atlantic and Europe model (NAE) and a high-resolution UK model (UKV), in addition to a variety of Crisis Area Models and other models that can be run on demand. Similar Unified Model suites with global and regional domains are used by many other national or military weather agencies around the world for operational forecasting.
Data for numerical weather prediction is provided by observations from satellites, from the ground (both human and from automatic weather stations), from buoys at sea, radar, radiosonde weather balloons, wind profilers, commercial aircraft and a background field from previous model runs. 
The computer model is only adjusted towards the observations using assimilation, rather than forcing the model to accept an observed value that might make the system unstable (and could be an inaccurate observation).
The Unified Model software suite is written in Fortran (originally 77 but now predominantly 90) and uses height as the vertical variable.
Because most developments of interest are at near to the ground the vertical layers are closer together near the surface.
Principal UM suites at the Met Office.
The Met Office runs a range of Numerical Weather Prediction suites using the UM.
All of the models use varying resolutions of topography with greater accuracy at higher resolutions. The limiting factor with all models is that for a weather event to be recorded by the model it must be at least three grid points in size. Thus for the global model at 40 km, a weather system must be at least 120 km to be modelled. This means smaller phenomena such as small depressions, smaller hurricanes and large thunderstorms are too small for the model to catch them. As the resolution increases smaller events can be caught, the 1.5 km model for example, is reputedly capable of modelling individual showers.
Global Model.
Approximately 25 km resolution with 70 vertical levels. Covers the entire globe and 144 hours in the future twice a day. The Global model provides boundary information for the North Atlantic European (NAE) model, for which additional shorter runs (48 hours) are produced twice a day. The model is kept close to the real atmosphere using hybrid 4D-Var data assimilation of observations. Along with the NWS's Global Forecast System, which runs out to 16 days, the ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) and the CMC's Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM), both of which run out 10 days, and the Naval Research Laboratory Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM), which runs out eight days, it is one of several synoptic scale medium-range models in general use.
North Atlantic and European model.
The Met Office's North Atlantic and European model (NAE) model has 70 levels with a 12 km resolution. It is run out to 48 hours from start. Because the UK is at a northern latitude the computer transposes the model area to an equatorial location so the grid points give an area that is more square. This reduces the load on the model, allowing it to run more quickly. The model is kept close to the real atmosphere using 4D-Var data assimilation of observations.
UK 4km model.
70 Vertical levels, 4 km horizontal resolution. Run out to 36 hours. Now being superseded by the UKV in many applications.
UKV model.
70 Vertical levels, 1.5 km horizontal resolution. Run out to 36 hours (this replaced the UK 4 km model in 2011). The forecast is run every 3 hours using boundary conditions from the 25-km global model. The resolution is 1.5 km over the UK, and 4 km over surrounding areas. The UKV model is kept close to observations using 3D-Var data assimilation every 3 hours. Example output from the UKV model can be seen here.
CAM.
The Crisis Area Model is a 12 km model that can be run for any area of the world should the need arise. This can include military use (the MMU use this on deployed operations) or environmental catastrophes.
Mountain Wave Models.
This high resolution model provides information on mountain waves for a variety of locations around the UK and other areas of interest to the Met Office.
Met Office's Global Wave Model.
This models sea waves around the world.
UM suites outside the Met Office.
Unified Model suites which are similar to those from the Met Office are run by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the South African Weather Service, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, the Korea Meteorological Administration and the Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences.
Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, have an operational 40 km resolution global forecasting system utilizing the Unified Model. This global system provides boundary conditions for a number of higher resolution regional systems also using the Unified Model.
Korea Meteorological Administration.
The Korea Meteorological Administration have an operational 25 km resolution global forecasting system utilizing the Unified Model. This global system provides boundary conditions for a 12 km resolution regional Unified Model NWP system covering South-East Asia.
UKCA.
United Kingdom Chemistry & Aerosols (UKCA) is a sub-model of the UM that deals with trace gas and aerosol chemistry within the model. This includes calculating the concentrations of climatically relevant gases such as methane and ozone, as well as the composition and evolution of aerosols. As with most of the UM, the UKCA was written in a collaboration between the UK Met Office and UK Academia.
JULES.
Joint UK Land Environment System is a land surface model that has been developed in a collaboration between the Met Office and other research institutes. JULES models the exchange of heat and moisture between the Unified Model atmosphere and the land surface and vegetation. JULES can also be used offline to estimate the impacts of different climate models on the land surface and hydrology.

Euler D.I

The Euler D.I was a German single-seat fighter based on the French Nieuport 11. After seeing the success of the French Nieuport 11 at the front, German designer August Euler set about to create a German aircraft based on the Nieuport design. The Euler D.I first flew in late 1916. It was powered by an 80 hp engine with the Euler patented machine gun on the front.
Operational history.
2 prototypes were recorded as being in service at the front in October 1916, and the German government ordered 50 in the same month. A further 50 were ordered in early 1917, but this order was largely transferred over to the D.I's successor, the Euler D.II. The plane saw very little combat service, being largely used as a fighter trainer for the remainder of the war.

The Ladies' Diary

"The Ladies' Diary: or, Woman's Almanack" appeared annually in London from 1704 to 1841. It featured material relating to calendars etc. including sunrise and sunset times and phases of the moon, as well as important dates (eclipses, holidays, school terms, etc.), and a chronology of remarkable events.
The subtitle indicated its serious purpose: ""Containing New Improvements in ARTS and SCIENCES, and many entertaining PARTICULARS: Designed for the USE AND DIVERSION OF THE FAIR SEX."" These included riddles (called enigmas), rebuses, charades, scientific queries, and mathematical questions. A typical volume in the series included answers submitted by readers to problems posed the previous year and a set of new problems, nearly all proposed by readers. Both puzzle and answer (revealed the following year) were often in verse. Each cover featured a picture of a prominent English woman.
The first editor and publisher, John Tipper, began the almanac by publishing a calendar, recipes, medicinal advice, stories and ended with "special rhyming riddles." By the 1709 issue, the contents changed to exclude recipes, medicinal advice, and stories and include more puzzles from both Tipper and those sent in by readers.
The second editor, Henry Beighton, took over the almanac after Tipper's death in 1713. He continued to publish the almanac rich in puzzles, and in 1720 began to include more difficult puzzles dealing with Newtonian infinitesimal calculus.

Operational history.
30 D.II fighters were ordered by the German air force in March 1917, however due to slow production these were not delivered until December 1917. As a result the D.II was relegated to the role of a trainer aircraft for the rest of the war.

Edmund C. Briggs

Edmund Clarke Briggs (20 February 1835 – 4 July 1913) was an American leader in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). Briggs was the first member of the RLDS Church to preach in Utah Territory to members of the rival Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
RLDS Church leader.
Briggs was born in Wheeler, Steben County, New York. In July 1852 he was converted into the Latter Day Saint movement after being taught by his brother Jason, who had earlier been baptized by Mormon missionaries. After being baptized, Edmund became an elder in the church. On 6 April 1860, when the RLDS Church was formally organized, Briggs became the president of the Seventy of the church. Later, in October 1860, Briggs was ordained an apostle and became a member of the Council of Twelve Apostles.
Mission to Utah Territory.
In 1863, RLDS Church president Joseph Smith III appointed Briggs to head the RLDS Church's first missionary effort in Utah Territory, where the rival LDS Church was headquartered. Briggs and Alexander McCord travelled 1000 miles by wagon and arrived in Salt Lake City on 7 August 1863. On 11 August, LDS Church president Brigham Young encouraged Briggs and McCord to leave Utah, suggesting that they may not be safe. Nevertheless, Briggs and McCord began preaching among the LDS Church members, and on 6 September they held a service in Salt Lake City where sixteen former LDS Church members were baptised into the RLDS Church. By 6 April 1864, there were 100 RLDS Church converts in Utah, by time Briggs and McCord left Utah later that year, there were over 300 RLDS members and a district of the RLDS Church there.
Later life.
Briggs was a member of the RLDS Church's Council of Twelve Apostles until 18 April 1902, when he was ordained a patriarch.

Chrysavgi

Chrysavgi is a mountain village in the municipality of Voio, West Macedonia, Greece. Only 30 minutes from Grevena and 20 minutes from Tsotyli, it is built with traditional architecture at an altitude of 860 meters. The stone houses give a special and impressive picture.
History.
The exact establishment date is difficult to pinpoint due to lack of historical evidences. The older register is from the 1534 codex in the Monastery of Zaborda and gives the old name of the village which was Mirali, a name taken probably from the Turkish commander of the area, Omer Ali. At 1927 it was renamed Stroggylon (which means round) and in 1930 received its final name Chrysavgi (which means “golden dawn”)
South of the village lay the stony remains of an ancient military settlement which was used to control the mountain passes. A copper statue of Athena was found in the area, along with metallic vessels, spearheads and daggers. Also Greek, Roman and Byzantine coins were unearthed by farmers.
The first settlers, according to tradition, were located at "Selio" point, 2 kilometers north of the village. In the area were scattered settlements which were destroyed by Turkish and Albanian raids. The remaining people established the modern village.
In 1793 many Voio villages were Islamized and became manors of the local Beys who were friendly to Ali Pasha. At Chrysavgi the Bey was Ali Koukos, to whom the residents paid the protective tax, one tenth of their production (Dekati). Beside the tax, they were bound to hand over to the Bey each new bride for him to spend the first wedding night with ("Ius primae noctis"). Some villagers were unable to tolerate this custom and killed the Bey in 1830. Next day was considered to be a "Golden Dawn" for the village. The remains of the Bey were discovered during an excavation in 1962, in "Koukos" point. The retaliation of the Turks for the murder of the Bey was a heavy tax enforced on the village. With this money, a mosque was built in Constantinople (Istanbul) which was named "Mirali Tzamisi".
Chrysavgi and the other villages ceased to be manors in 1836 after a firman from Sultan Mahmud II.

Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009

Serbia participated at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, after hosting the 2008 contest in Belgrade.
Beovizija 2009.
Beovizija 2009 was the 7th edition of Beovizija music festival. The semi-finals were held on March 7, 2009, while the finals were held a day later on March 8. The winner of this Beovizija represented Serbia in the second semi-final of the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest on May 14, 2009, at the Olympic Indoor Arena in Moscow, Russia. The winning song was "Cipela" by Marko Kon and Milaan.
At Eurovision.
Since Serbia is not one of the "Big Four" and is not the host of the 2009 contest, it had to compete in one of the two semi-finals. At the semi-final allocation draw on 30 January, it was decided that the country would compete in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009.
Marko and Milaan performed 4th in the running order of the semi-final, following Latvia and preceding Poland. The duo failed to qualify Serbia to the final for the first time in the country's Eurovision history. However, if Latvia had indeed withdrawn as it was going to at one stage, it would've actually placed 9th, so it would've qualified to the final in favour of Lithuania.

Flashing Red

Flashing Red is a brown Australian bred Standardbred racehorse that was foaled in 1997. He is notable in that he won both the Auckland Trotting Cup and two New Zealand Trotting Cups. These races are the richest harness races in New Zealand. He was victorious in every harness racing state of Australia and New Zealand and earned over $2,000,000 during his racing career.
Breeding.
John Campbell bred Flashing Red who was by his stallion Echelon (US1.50.6, 32 wins, $558,568) and he was the last foal of his dam the unraced Courvy Kazi by Courvoisier. Echelon sired 107 winners during six seasons at stud. Flashing Red was inbred to Meadow Skipper in the third and fourth generations (3f x 4f). Eric Blomquist, a Tasmanian owner-trainer purchased Flashing Red privately as a yearling. 
Racing career.
Flashing Red was a winner as a two-year-old for Blomquist and was second Tasmanian Metro Stakes and third in the Tasmanian Golden Slipper. He won 16 races from 60 starts for Blomquist including the Danbury Park Cup, the 2002 and 2003 Hobart Free For All, plus the $25,000 Devonport Cup by the end of his five-year-old campaign. 
Barrie Rattray then purchased Flashing Red for $20,000 and sold him afterwards to Stuart Hunter and Norm Jenkins for $40,000. His new owners were hoping that he would be successful in Queensland racing. Flashing Red confirmed their hopes in 2004 by winning the $50,000 Cordina Sprint at Harold Park, Group 2 (G2) Queensland Winter Cup at Albion Park, pacing the 2,680 metres in 1.57.4 mile rate, and the (G2) Albion Park Winter Cup. 
In 2005 Flashing Red won the $105,000 Ballarat Pacing Cup when he defeated Sokyola, and the listed South Australian Barastoc Cup (Clipsal Cup) and also finished second in the South Australia Cup to Young Rufus.
In 2006 he won the New Zealand Cup, Victorian Popular Alm Free for All (FFA), Ashburton Flying Stakes, Methven Cup Meth (both in New Zealand) and two heats of the Inter Dominion Pacing Championship in Tasmania.
In 2007 he won the New Zealand Cup (for the second time) running a NZ record time over the 3,200 metres and Auckland Cup and was second in the Tooheys Mile to Hexus. 
Despite being trained in Australia for most of his career, his greatest achievements came in staying races on the larger tracks in New Zealand, where he won the New Zealand Trotting Cup as a nine-year-old and 10-year-old, in 2006 and 2007. He also won the 2007 Auckland Cup and the 2006/07 New Zealand Horse of the Year and Australasian Pacers Grand Circuit titles. 
Stud record.
Flashing Red was retired to stand at Roydon Lodge Stud, Wellington, N.Z. at a service fee of $1,500 plus GST.
He was inducted into the Queensland Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 2008.

USS Sandalwood (AN-32)

USS "Sandalwood" (YN-27/AN-32) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was later transferred to the French Navy as Luciole. She was stricken from the French Navy and sold to Malaysian owners, but her fate beyond that is unreported in secondary sources.
Career.
"Sandalwood" (YN-27) was laid down on 18 October 1940 by the American Shipbuilding Company, Lorain, Ohio; launched on 6 March 1941; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Wallace; delivered on 24 October 1941; and placed in service on 25 October 1941.
Following transit of the St. Lawrence River, "Sandalwood" proceeded down the U.S. East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she remained, conducting net operations and performing occasional patrol or salvage duties, into 1944. Then, redesignated "AN-32", effective 22 January, and commissioned on 1 June, she prepared for overseas duty.
On 1 October, "Sandalwood" was detached from the 5th Naval District. Two weeks later, in the Panama Canal Zone, she reported to CinCPac and continued on to California and Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 25 November. She remained in the Hawaiian area into 1945; and, in late February, got underway for the Marshall Islands. At Eniwetok by mid-March, she conducted net operations there through the end of World War II. On 24 November, she steamed east, arrived at San Pedro, California, in early January 1946; and, four months later, moved north to Astoria, Oregon, for inactivation.
Decommissioned on 13 August, "Sandalwood" was laid up with the Pacific Reserve Fleet, initially at Bremerton, Washington, and later at Stockton, California. In 1962, she was transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay. Five years later, she was returned to the Navy and sold to the government of France. Transferred in September 1967, she served as "Luciole" until sold by the French government.

Many children in the local drop out of school due to the difficult life there, mainly those living in the lower land, who depend on farming have less access to education.
The last two years, the residents in Sedika and surrounding have been affected by extreme rainfall and drought one after another. This area of Arsi was known for its crop production in addition to animal grazing. The lack of market access for their products has affected the life of many farmers and they live in very bad situation even if they are working hard. 
Demographics.
Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Sedika has an estimated total population of 2,604 of whom 1,206 are men and 1,398 are women. The 1994 national census reported this town had a total population of 1,459 of whom 654 were men and 805 were women.

Morita Kan'ya XIV

Lineage.
Kan'ya was the fourteenth in the line of actors and theatre managers to hold the name Morita Kan'ya. Previous bearers of the name were managers ("zamoto") of the Morita-za kabuki theatre in Edo (later Tokyo) until 1894.
Kan'ya was adopted by Morita Kan'ya XIII, and in turn was the adoptive father of Bandō Tamasaburō V.
Life and career.
Kan'ya made his first appearance onstage at the age of seven, at the Kabuki-za in Tokyo, under the stagename Bandō Tamasaburō IV. He would later take the name Bandō Shūka III and, following the death of his adoptive father in 1932, became Morita Kan'ya XIV in 1935. He was, like most kabuki actors, quite prolific, and for a number of years in the 1930s was a member of a group of young actors called ""Seinen Kabuki"" (Young men Kabuki) who performed regularly at the Shin Kabuki-za in Tokyo, then called the "Shinjuku Daiichi Gekijō" (First Shinjuku Theatre).
In the early postwar years, Kan'ya acted in a number of films, including "Surōnin Makaritōru" (1947), "Otomi to Yosaburō" (1950), and "Edo no Hanamichi" (1953).
Remaining quite active on the kabuki stage as well, Kan'ya performed in many revivals at the National Theatre, taking part as well in the Theatre's 1966 opening ceremonies and the associated performance of "Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami". He also often performed alongside his adopted son Bandō Tamasaburō V.
Kan'ya made his last Tokyo stage appearance in December 1974, in a production of "Kanadehon Chūshingura" at the National Theatre, and his final stage appearance the following month, at Nagoya's Chūnichi Theatre. He died on 28 March 1975.

Gamma ray

Gamma radiation, also known as gamma rays, and denoted by the Greek letter γ, refers to electromagnetic radiation of extremely high frequency and therefore high energy per photon. Gamma rays are ionizing radiation, and are thus biologically hazardous. They are classically produced by the decay from high energy states of atomic nuclei (gamma decay), but are also created by other processes. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard's radiation was named "gamma rays" by Ernest Rutherford in 1903.
Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally occurring radioisotopes, and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. Rare terrestrial natural sources produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. Additionally, gamma rays are also produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary gamma rays via bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation. However, a large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft.
Gamma rays typically have frequencies above 10 exahertz (or >1019 Hz), and therefore have energies above 100 keV and wavelengths less than 10 picometers (less than the diameter of an atom). However, this is not a hard and fast definition, but rather only a rule-of-thumb description for natural processes. Gamma rays from radioactive decay are defined as gamma rays no matter what their energy, so that there is no "lower" limit to gamma energy derived from radioactive decay. Gamma decay commonly produces energies of a few hundred keV, and almost always less than 10 MeV. In astronomy, gamma rays are defined by their energy, and no production process need be specified. The energies of gamma rays from astronomical sources range over 10 TeV, at a level far too large to result from radioactive decay. A notable example is extremely powerful bursts of high-energy radiation normally referred to as long duration gamma-ray bursts, which produce gamma rays by a mechanism not compatible with radioactive decay. These bursts of gamma rays, thought to be due to the collapse of stars called hypernovae, are the most powerful events so far discovered in the cosmos.
History of discovery.
The first gamma ray source to be discovered historically was the radioactive decay process called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an excited nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation (it is now understood that a nuclear isomeric transition, however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life). Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as "radioactivity" by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type. Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously-named rays, by Ernest Rutherford, who in 1903 named Villard's rays "gamma rays" by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899. The "rays" emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not "easily" deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and beta rays.
Gamma rays were first thought to be particles with mass, like alpha and beta rays. Rutherford initially believed they might be extremely fast beta particles, but their failure to be deflected by a magnetic field indicated they had no charge. In 1914, gamma rays were observed to be reflected from crystal surfaces, proving they were electromagnetic radiation. Rutherford and his coworker Edward Andrade measured the wavelengths of gamma rays from radium, and found that they were similar to X-rays but with shorter wavelengths and (thus) higher frequency. This was eventually recognized as giving them also more energy per photon, as soon as the latter term became generally accepted. A gamma decay was then understood to usually emit a single gamma photon.
Sources of gamma rays.
Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally occurring radioisotopes such as potassium-40, and also as a secondary radiation from various atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. Some rare terrestrial natural sources that produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, are lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, which produce high energy emissions from natural high-energy voltages. Gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced. Such electrons produce secondary gamma rays by the mechanisms of bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation. A large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and must be detected by spacecraft. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include fission such as occurs in nuclear reactors, and high energy physics experiments, such as neutral pion decay and nuclear fusion.
General characteristics.
The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays has changed in recent decades. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes almost invariably had a longer wavelength than the radiation (gamma rays) emitted by radioactive nuclei. Older literature distinguished between X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength, with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10−11 m, defined as gamma rays.
However, with artificial sources now able to duplicate any electromagnetic radiation that originates in the nucleus, as well as far higher energies, the wavelengths characteristic of radioactive gamma ray sources vs. other types, now completely overlap. Thus, gamma rays are now usually distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by definition by electrons outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus. Exceptions to this convention occur in astronomy, where gamma decay is seen in the afterglow of certain supernovas, but other high energy processes known to involve other than radioactive decay are still classed as sources of gamma radiation. A notable example is extremely powerful bursts of high-energy radiation normally referred to as long duration gamma-ray bursts, which produce gamma rays by a mechanism not compatible with radioactive decay. These bursts of gamma rays, thought to be due to the collapse of stars called hypernovae, are the most powerful events so far discovered in the cosmos.
Naming conventions and overlap in terminology.
In the past, the distinction between X-rays and gamma rays was based on energy, with gamma rays being considered a higher-energy version of electromagnetic radiation. However, modern high-energy X-rays produced by linear accelerators for megavoltage treatment in cancer often have higher energy (4 to 25 MeV) than do most classical gamma rays produced by nuclear gamma decay. One of the most common gamma ray emitting isotopes used in diagnostic nuclear medicine, technetium-99m, produces gamma radiation of the same energy (140 keV) as that produced by diagnostic X-ray machines, but of significantly lower energy than therapeutic photons from linear particle accelerators. In the medical community today, the convention that radiation produced by nuclear decay is the only type referred to as "gamma" radiation is still respected.
Because of this broad overlap in energy ranges, in physics the two types of electromagnetic radiation are now often defined by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons (either in orbitals outside of the nucleus, or while being accelerated to produce bremsstrahlung-type radiation), while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus or by means of other particle decays or annihilation events. There is no lower limit to the energy of photons produced by nuclear reactions, and thus ultraviolet or lower energy photons produced by these processes would also be defined as "gamma rays". The only naming-convention that is still universally respected is the rule that electromagnetic radiation that is known to be of atomic nuclear origin is "always" referred to as "gamma rays," and never as X-rays. However, in physics and astronomy, the reverse convention that all gamma rays are considered to be of nuclear origin is frequently violated.
In astronomy, higher energy gamma and X-rays are defined by energy, since the processes which produce them may be uncertain and photon energy, not origin, determines the required astronomical detectors needed. High energy photons occur in nature which are known to be produced by processes other than nuclear decay but are still referred to as gamma radiation. An example is "gamma rays" from lightning discharges at 10 to 20 MeV, and known to be produced by the bremsstrahlung mechanism.
Another example is gamma-ray bursts, now known to be produced from processes too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing radioactive decay. This has led to the realization that many gamma rays produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or particle annihilation, but rather in much the same manner as the production of X-rays. Although gamma rays in astronomy are discussed below as non-radioactive events, in fact a few gamma rays are known in astronomy to originate explicitly from gamma decay of nuclei (as demonstrated by their spectra and emission half life). A classic example is that of supernova SN 1987A, which emits an "afterglow" of gamma-ray photons from the decay of newly-made radioactive nickel-56 and cobalt-56. Most gamma rays in astronomy, however, arise by other mechanisms. Astronomical literature tends to write "gamma-ray" with a hyphen, by analogy to X-rays, rather than in a way analogous to alpha rays and beta rays. This notation tends to subtly stress the non-nuclear source of most astronomical "gamma-rays."
Units of measure and exposure.
The measure of gamma rays' ionizing ability is called the exposure:
However, the effect of gamma and other ionizing radiation on living tissue is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited rather than the charge. This is called the absorbed dose:
The equivalent dose is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For gamma rays it is equal to the absorbed dose.
Properties.
Shielding.
Shielding from gamma rays requires large amounts of mass, in contrast to alpha particles which can be blocked by paper or skin, and beta particles which can be shielded by foil. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. For this reason, a lead shield is only modestly better (20–30% better) as a gamma shield, than an equal mass of another shielding material such as aluminium, concrete, water or soil; lead's major advantage is not in lower weight, but rather its compactness due to its higher density. Protective clothing, goggles and respirators can protect from internal contact with or ingestion of alpha or beta emitting particles, but provide no protection from gamma radiation from external sources.
The higher the energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the shielding made from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the half value layer or HVL). For example gamma rays that require (0.4″) of lead to reduce their intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by of granite rock, 6 cm (2½″) of concrete, or 9 cm (3½″) of packed soil. However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20–30% greater than that of lead with the same absorption capability. Depleted uranium is used for shielding in portable gamma ray sources, but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, as portable sources' shape resembles a sphere to some extent, and the volume of a sphere is dependent on the cube of the radius; so a source with its radius cut in half will have its volume reduced eight times, which will more than compensate uranium's greater density (as well as reducing bulk). In a nuclear power plant, shielding can be provided by steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a "hot" fuel assembly into the air would result in much higher radiation levels than when kept under water.
Matter interaction.
When a gamma ray passes through matter, the probability for absorption is proportional to the thickness of the layer, the density of the material, and the absorption cross section of the material. The total absorption shows an exponential decrease of intensity with distance from the incident surface:
where x is the distance from the incident surface, μ = "n"σ is the absorption coefficient, measured in cm−1, "n" the number of atoms per cm3 of the material (atomic density) and σ the absorption cross section in cm2.
As it passes through matter, gamma radiation ionizes via three processes: the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and pair production.
The secondary electrons (and/or positrons) produced in any of these three processes frequently have enough energy to produce much ionization themselves.
Additionally, gamma rays, particularly high energy ones, can interact with atomic nuclei resulting in ejection of particles in photodisintegration, or in some cases, even nuclear fission (photofission).
Light interaction.
High-energy (from 80 to 500 GeV) gamma rays arriving from far-distant quasars are used to estimate the extragalactic background light in the universe: The highest-energy rays interact more readily with the background light photons and thus the density of the background light may be estimated by analyzing the incoming gamma ray spectrums.
Gamma ray production.
Gamma rays can be produced by a wide range of phenomena, both nuclear and non-nuclear.
Radioactive decay (gamma decay).
Gamma rays from radioactive gamma decay are produced alongside other forms of radiation such as alpha or beta, and are produced after the other types of decay occur. The mechanism is that when a nucleus emits an or particle, the daughter nucleus is usually left in an excited state. It can then move to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon, in the same way that an atomic electron can jump to a lower energy state by emitting a light ray photon. Emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state typically requires only 10−12 seconds, and is thus nearly instantaneous. Gamma decay from excited states may also follow nuclear reactions such as neutron capture, nuclear fission, or nuclear fusion.
In certain cases, the excited nuclear state following the emission of a beta particle may be more stable than average, and is termed a metastable excited state, if its decay is (at least) 100 to 1000 times longer than the average 10−12 seconds. Such nuclei have half-lives that are more easily measurable, and are termed nuclear isomers. Some rare nuclear isomers are able to stay in their excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far longer, before emitting a gamma ray. Isomeric transition is the name given to a "gamma decay" from such a state. The process of isomeric transition is therefore similar to any gamma emission, but differs in that it involves the intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the nuclei. Metastable states are characterized by high nuclear spin, requiring a change in spin of several units or more with gamma decay, instead of a single unit transition that results in gamma decay in only 10−12 seconds.
An emitted gamma ray from any type of excited state may transfer its energy directly to one of the most tightly bound electrons causing it to be ejected from the atom, a process termed the photoelectric effect (it should not be confused with the internal conversion process, in which no real gamma ray photon is produced as an intermediate particle).
Gamma rays, X-rays, visible light, and radio waves are all forms of electromagnetic radiation. The only difference is the frequency and hence the energy of those photons. Gamma rays are generally the most energetic of these, although broad overlap with X-ray energies occurs. An example of gamma ray production follows:
First decays to excited by beta decay by emission of an electron of 0.31 MeV. Then the excited drops down to the ground state (see nuclear shell model) by emitting two gamma rays in succession (1.17 MeV then 1.33 MeV). This path is followed 99.88% of the time:
Another example is the alpha decay of to form ; this alpha decay is accompanied by gamma emission. In some cases, the gamma emission spectrum for a nucleus (daughter nucleus) is quite simple, (e.g. /) while in other cases, such as with (/ and /), the gamma emission spectrum is complex, revealing that a series of nuclear energy levels can exist. The fact that an alpha spectrum can have a series of different peaks with different energies reinforces the idea that several nuclear energy levels are possible.
Because a beta decay is accompanied by the emission of a neutrino which also carries energy away, the beta spectrum does not have sharp lines, but instead has a broad peak. Hence from beta decay alone it is not possible to probe the different energy levels found in the nucleus.
In optical spectroscopy, it is well known that an entity which emits light can also absorb light at the same wavelength (photon energy). For instance, a sodium flame can emit yellow light as well as absorb the yellow light from another sodium-vapor lamp. In the case of gamma rays, this can be seen in Mössbauer spectroscopy. Here, a correction for the Doppler shift due to recoil of the nucleus usually is not required, since the emitting and absorbing atoms are locked into a crystal, which absorbs their momentum (see Mössbauer effect). In this way, the exact conditions for gamma ray absorption through resonance can be attained.
This is similar to the Franck Condon effects seen in optical spectroscopy.
Gamma rays from sources other than radioactive decay.
A few gamma rays in astronomy are known to arise from gamma decay (see discussion of SN1987A) but most do not.
Gamma radiation, like X-radiation, can be produced by a variety of phenomena. When high-energy gamma rays, electrons, or protons bombard materials, the excited atoms within emit characteristic "secondary" gamma rays, which are products of the temporary creation of excited nuclear states in the bombarded atoms (such transitions form a topic in nuclear spectroscopy). Such gamma rays are produced by the nucleus, but not as a result of nuclear excitement from radioactive decay.
Energy in the gamma radiation range, often explicitly called gamma-radiation when it comes from astrophysical sources, is also produced by sub-atomic particle and particle-photon interactions. These include electron-positron annihilation, neutral pion decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation.
High energy gamma rays in astronomy include the gamma ray background produced when cosmic rays (either high speed electrons or protons) interact with ordinary matter, producing pair-production gamma rays at 511 keV. Alternatively bremsstrahlung at energies of tens of MeV or more are produced when cosmic ray electrons interact with nuclei of sufficiently high atomic number (see gamma ray image of the Moon at the beginning of this article, for illustration).
The so-called "long-duration" gamma-ray bursts produce events in which energies of ~ 1044 joules (as much energy as our Sun will produce in its entire life-time) but over a period of only 20 to 40 seconds, accompanied by high-efficiency conversion to gamma rays (on the order of 50% total energy conversion). The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation production of gamma rays from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leaving the region near the event horizon of the newly formed black hole during the supernova explosion, and focused for a few tens of seconds into a relativistic beam by the magnetic field of the exploding hypernova. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth, it shines with high gamma ray power even at distances of up to 10 billion light years—close to the edge of the visible universe.
Health effects.
All ionizing radiation causes similar damage at a cellular level, but because rays of alpha particles and beta particles are relatively non-penetrating, external exposure to them causes only localized damage, e.g. radiation burns to the skin. Gamma rays and neutrons are more penetrating, causing diffuse damage throughout the body (e.g. radiation sickness, cell's DNA damage, cell death due to damaged DNA, increasing incidence of cancer) rather than burns. External radiation exposure should also be distinguished from internal exposure, due to ingested or inhaled radioactive substances, which, depending on the substance's chemical nature, can produce both diffuse and localized internal damage.
Uses.
Gamma rays provide information about some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe; however, they are largely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Instruments aboard high-altitude balloons and satellites missions such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope provide our only view of the universe in gamma rays.
Gamma-induced molecular changes can also be used to alter the properties of semi-precious stones, and is often used to change white topaz into blue topaz.
Non-contact industrial sensors used in the Refining, Mining, Chemical, Food, Soaps and Detergents, and Pulp and Paper industries, in applications measuring levels, density, and thicknesses commonly use sources of gamma radiation. Typically these use Co-60 or Cs-137 isotopes as the radiation source.
In the US, gamma ray detectors are beginning to be used as part of the Container Security Initiative (CSI). These US$5 million machines are advertised to scan 30 containers per hour. The objective of this technique is to screen merchant ship containers before they enter US ports.
Gamma radiation is often used to kill living organisms, in a process called irradiation. Applications of this include sterilizing medical equipment (as an alternative to autoclaves or chemical means), removing decay-causing bacteria from many foods or preventing fruit and vegetables from sprouting to maintain freshness and flavor.
Despite their cancer-causing properties, gamma rays are also used to treat some types of cancer, since the rays kill cancer cells also. In the procedure called gamma-knife surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma rays are directed on the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells. The beams are aimed from different angles to concentrate the radiation on the growth while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.
Gamma rays are also used for diagnostic purposes in nuclear medicine in imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes are used. For example, in a PET scan a radiolabeled sugar called fludeoxyglucose emits positrons that are converted to pairs of gamma rays that localize cancer (which often takes up more sugar than other surrounding tissues). The most common gamma emitter used in medical applications is the nuclear isomer technetium-99m which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a gamma camera can be used to form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also SPECT). Depending on what molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to the bones in a bone scan).
Body response.
When gamma radiation breaks DNA molecules, a cell may be able to repair the damaged genetic material, within limits. However, a study of Rothkamm and Lobrich has shown that this repair process works well after high-dose exposure but is much slower in the case of a low-dose exposure.
Risk assessment.
The natural outdoor exposure in Great Britain ranges from 2 to 4 nSv/h (nanosieverts per hour). Natural exposure to gamma rays is about 1 to 2 mSv per year, and the average total amount of radiation received in one year per inhabitant in the USA is 3.6 mSv. There is a small increase in the dose, due to naturally occurring gamma radiation, around small particles of high atomic number materials in the human body caused by the photoelectric effect.
By comparison, the radiation dose from chest radiography (about 0.06 mSv) is a fraction of the annual naturally occurring background radiation dose. A chest CT delivers 5 to 8 mSv. A whole-body PET/CT scan can deliver 14 to 32 mSv depending on the protocol. The dose from fluoroscopy of the stomach is much higher, approximately 50 mSv (14 times the annual yearly background).
An acute full-body equivalent single exposure dose of 1 Sv (1000 mSv) causes slight blood changes, but 2.0–3.5 Sv (2.0–3.5 Gy) causes very severe syndrome of nausea, hair loss, and hemorrhaging, and will cause death in a sizable number of cases—-about 10% to 35% without medical treatment. A dose of 5 Sv (5 Gy) is considered approximately the LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of exposed population) for an acute exposure to radiation even with standard medical treatment. A dose higher than 5 Sv (5 Gy) brings an increasing chance of death above 50%. Above 7.5–10 Sv (7.5–10 Gy) to the entire body, even extraordinary treatment, such as bone-marrow transplants, will not prevent the death of the individual exposed (see "Radiation poisoning"). (Doses much larger than this may, however, be delivered to selected parts of the body in the course of radiation therapy.)
For low dose exposure, for example among nuclear workers, who receive an average yearly radiation dose of 19 mSv, the risk of dying from cancer (excluding leukemia) increases by 2 percent. For a dose of 100 mSv, the risk increase is 10 percent. By comparison, risk of dying from cancer was increased by 32 percent for the survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Urzędów

Urzędów is a village in Kraśnik County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Urzędów. It lies in Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Kraśnik and south-west of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 1,060, and in 1405-1869 it had a status of a town.
Urzędów lies on the Urzędówka river, among the hills of the Lublin Upland. In the past, it used to be one of major urban centers of eastern Lesser Poland, placed on a merchant road from Kraków to Lublin, and further on to Lithuania. The town was granted Magdeburg rights in 1405 by King Władysław Jagiełło, replacing two villages - Zaborzyce and Skorczyce, which had existed in the location of Urzędów. In 1474 it became the seat of a county in Lublin Voivodeship, which in the same year was carved out of Sandomierz Voivodeship. Urzędów remained an important urban center of the area until the mid-17th century, when, after long - lasting conflicts with the Cossacks and the Swedes (see Deluge, Khmelnytsky Uprising) it was burned. Urzędów lost its town privileges in 1869, never to recover them.
Jewish History.
During the reign of King Augustus III (1733-1763) people living in Urzędów repeatedly complained to him about being oppressed by the Jews. In 1791 they demanded that starost Kazimierz Rzewuski should expel the remaining Jews from the town. In 1781 there were as few as 11 Jews in Urzędów (0.5% of the entire population). It was not until after 1862 that Urzędów started to receive a steady influx of the Jews. At the end of the 19th century the Urzędów kehilla was formed. Though small, the Jewish community was active in social and economic life of the town. In 1889 there were 3.017 residents in Urzędów, out of whom 242 (8%) were Jewish. In 1900 it was inhabited by 3,620 people, including 303 Jews (8.37%).
Before the outbreak of World War II about 40 Jewish families lived in Urzędów (i.e. about 300 people). During the war, on September 23, 1939, German occupation authorities ordered that Jewish children should be banned from state schools. Since January 5, 1940 the Jews had to wear a band with the Star of David on their left arms. In October 1942 Jews from Urzędów were transported to the Kraśnik ghetto and Budzyń camp, which were just stopovers on their grim way to Bełżec. During the Nazi occupation 300 Jews from Urzędów were killed. The Jewish cemetery was plundered during World War II and afterwards. In 1993, local inhabitants arranged a matzevot-shaped plaque in memory of Urzędów Jews murdered by the Nazis from 1939-1944.

Heinkel He 49

The Heinkel He 49 was a German single-bay single-seat biplane of mixed construction armed with two machine guns. Four designs were made, the He 49a, He 49b, He 49c, and the He 51 which went on to become a "Luftwaffe" fighter.
Production history.
The first prototype, the He 49a, was flown in November 1932, and the second prototype, the He 49b, followed in February 1933, with a modified fuselage to make it 40 cm (16 in) longer. This was later turned into a floatplane, the He 49bW, and the third prototype, the He 49c, had a different engine. The He 49d went on to become the He 51, a fighter used during the Spanish Civil War which continued in service as an advanced trainer and ground-attack aircraft into the early years of World War II.
Operational history.
All variants - apart from the He 51 - were just prototypes, and were never deployed.

Malcolm McEachern

Walter Malcolm Neil McEachern (1 April 1883 – 17 January 1945) was a noted Australian bass singer who enjoyed a successful career in the United Kingdom, both as a concert soloist and as one half of the comic musical duo Flotsam and Jetsam.
Birth, singing career and death.
He was born in Albury, New South Wales, the sixth of 13 children of Archibald Hector McEachern and his wife, Rebecca Mary.
On 2 February 1916, McEachern married pianist Hazel Hogarth Doyle, who later became his accompanist and provided the musical direction for his career.
Career and death.
During World War I, McEachern went on a tour of Australia with the great Australian soprano Nellie Melba. Also in the touring company were Ella Caspers, Ada Crossley and Marie Narelle.
In 1921 McEachern went to England with his wife, where he was hailed as one of the world's best bass vocalists. He was especially acclaimed as an oratorio singer although his voice was equally well suited to the demands of opera; but unlike his finest contemporary rival among English-language basses, Norman Allin, he elected not to pursue a career in that particular art form. McEachern did appear, however, in an array of staged Gilbert and Sullivan Savoy operettas under the batons of the famous conductors Sir Henry Wood and Sir John Barbirolli.
In early 1926, McEachern forged a light-entertainment collaboration with Bentley Collingwood Hilliam, a pianist from Yorkshire. Their act proved to be a great success with British audiences and they became famous as Mr. Flotsam and Mr. Jetsam.
McEachern was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus and died after an operation in London on 17 January 1945.
His name is commemorated in Australia by McEachern Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Melba.
Recordings.
McEachern made a total of 187 studio recordings, including pieces of music from opera, operetta and oratorio as well as a number of popular songs of the day. These records display the impressive depth, power and tonal richness of his voice and the excellence of his technique.
One of his English-language 78-rpm discs, made with his countryman Harold Williams, of "The Gendarmes' Duet" from Jacques Offenbach's "Geneviève de Brabant", is considered to be a classic recording. Produced in 1933, it has been re-issued many times since and is available on CD.
In 1983 EMI Records Australia together with The National Library of Australia released 49 of McEachern's recordings as a 3 LP record compilation transferred from 78 rpm pressings manufactured in Australia.

University College Dublin Library

UCD Library dates from the establishment of University College Dublin (UCD) as a constituent college of the National University of Ireland in 1908. It supports the learning, teaching and research needs of some 24,000 students and staff (plus a considerable number based in affiliated and otherwise related UCD programmes abroad) in a wide range of disciplines including agriculture, architecture, arts and humanities, business studies, engineering, law, medicine, science, social sciences and veterinary medicine.
University College Dublin (UCD) is the Republic of Ireland's largest university. It is located in Dublin, capital of Ireland.
Buildings and locations.
There are 5 UCD libraries: the James Joyce Library at Belfield serves as the administrative centre of the library system: it accommodates the central services and 85% of the stock; the Health Sciences library (for medicine, nursing and physiotherapy) is located in the UCD Health Sciences Centre at Belfield; Architecture (for architecture, landscape and planning) is in the Richview precinct at Belfield; Veterinary Medicine, located in the Veterinary Sciences Centre at Belfield; the UCD Michael Smurfit School of Business library at the Blackrock Campus.
Accommodation for readers consists of some 3,150 reading and study places, including some single and group study and PBL rooms, and a social learning area. Wireless internet is available throughout all of the libraries, there are wired network points provided, and a limited number of power outlets are available to about a third of study seats. A number of IT Services open computer labs and PC clusters are located within the libraries.
Information resources.
The Library as a whole contains about a million print volumes, with substantial collections of around a million non-print formats, including 650,000 e-books. Almost 80% of stock is on open access. Approximately 9,500 purchased monographs, and 2,500 donations or legal deposit items are added to stock each year, and 32,000 current journal titles and databases are available, the vast majority of which are e-journals. In summer 2013 the Library piloted PDA – Patron Driven Acquisition – for a significant amount of its spend on both print and online materials and this pilot is now being assessed. The Library is a European Documentation Centre, a national depository for United States government publications, and a legal deposit library for Irish publications. A small but significant holding of some 30,000 early printed books and special collections is housed in a separate bookstack with independent environmental control. In addition, almost 40,000 pre- 1930 items are managed by them and will be added to Special Collections when space is available. This additional material is currently on open access or in the Library store.
The UCD Digital Library.
The UCD Library supports digital repository services for dissemination of open access publications by university staff as well as for management of digitised cultural heritage resources and data produced or consumed by the UCD community.
In collaboration with UCD Research, there is interoperability between the Library Institutional Repository (IR) and the UCD Research Management System (RMS) providing a single route to update research profiles and deposit individual full text items. The institutional repository is based on DSpace and provides access to full text articles, working papers, reports, and other staff publications. It also provides a means of exporting information to a national open access repository, RIAN, as well as other subject-specific portals.
The UCD Digital Library, the successor to the IVRLA project, is a platform for the dissemination of diverse digital content associated with the University. The major cultural heritage collection is the Irish Virtual Research Library and Archive (IVRLA); additional information includes geographic, quantitative and qualitative data produced or consumed by the UCD community. The new platform went live in summer 2012.
Library management system and other online environments.
A new Library Management System,from Innovative Interfaces went live in July 2012. The Library website was completely re-designed and the content refreshed in 2011. In 2013 the Library piloted the LibGuides product as a complement to the website and decided to mainstream this from 2014 for subject and thematic guides. The Library also maintains a presence in the key social media. These include an instant messaging chat service, a Twitter feed, an Instagram presence, a YouTube channel and a page on Facebook.
A mobile website and catalogue are available, with integration of these into the University app, and a wider mobile strategy and service is developing.
Services.
Lending (including self-service lending at all our sites), document supply, information skills training, and reference and information services are available in all library locations. Print journals, reference materials, official publications, theses, and Special Collections materials are not available for loan. A charge is made for Inter-Library Loan and document supply. Copi Print provides print and copying facilities, on a paid self-service basis, in the libraries and in other University buildings.
Services are increasingly moving online, with online fines and charges payment introduced November 2013 using the University e-wallet system UCard, followed by online group study room booking from January 2014 using the Springshare product LibCal.
The James Joyce and Health Sciences libraries provide a laptop loan service. This service enables students and staff to borrow laptops on a short-term basis within the confines of the library.
The Short Loan collection in the James Joyce library and the entire stock of the Blackrock and Veterinary Medicine libraries uses RFID technology. This allows readers to borrow and return books without the assistance of library staff.
Opening hours in each of the five UCD libraries vary throughout the year.
Online access is provided on a 24/7 basis to an extensive range of databases, information services, electronic journals, subject guides and e-Learning materials.

Paroecopolis is presented by Sophrone Pétridès in a 1911 article in the "Catholic Encyclopedia" as a bishopric of uncertain name (Paroecopolis, Parthicopolis, Parthenopolis) and situated either in Macedonia, or in Thrace. 
Pétridès relates that the town is mentioned by Ptolemy as being in Sintice, a part of Macedonia, and by Phlegon. Hierocles and Constantine Porphyrogenitus call it Parthicopolis, but the second locates it in Thrace. Stephanus Byzantius calls it Parthenopolis and relates according to Theagenes the legend of its foundation by Grastus, son of Mygdon, said to have named the city in honour of his two daughters. Pliny has the same name, but places it in Thrace.
Its bishop, Jonas or John, assisted at the Council of Sardica (342 or 343); at the Council of Chalcedon (451) there was present John "Parthicopolis primæ Macedoniae".
This see is not mentioned in any of the Greek "Notitiae episcopatuum", nor is there any mention of it, under any of the three names, in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.

Rock, Rock, Rock (film)

Rock, Rock, Rock! is a 1956 black-and-white motion picture featuring performances from a number of early rock 'n' roll stars, such as Chuck Berry, LaVern Baker, Teddy Randazzo, The Moonglows, The Flamingos, and The Teenagers with Frankie Lymon as lead singer. Future "West Side Story" cast member David Winters is also featured. Famed disk jockey Alan Freed makes an appearance as himself. The voice of the main character (Dori Graham) was sung by Connie Francis. 
The movie has a fairly simple plot: teenage girl Dori Graham (played by then 13-year-old Tuesday Weld) can't convince her dad to buy her a strapless gown and has to get the money together herself in time for the prom.
The soundtrack album, also titled "Rock, Rock, Rock", is nowadays widely regarded as Chuck Berry's first album. Many of the artists featured in the film do not appear on the album, and only four songs on the album ("Over and Over Again," "I Knew From the Stars," "You Can't Catch Me," and "Would I Be Crying") actually appear in the film.
Both Jack Collins and Valerie Harper (who makes a brief appearance as an extra in the crowd at the prom) made their film debut in "Rock, Rock, Rock".
In 1984, the film entered the public domain (in the USA) due to the claimants failure to renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.
Production.
This was the first feature film collaboration between Milton Subotsky and Max Rosenberg.
Reception.
The film was a success at the box office.

Real Face

"Real Face" is a song written by Shikao Suga, Joker, Tak Matsumoto and Chokkaku for the debut single and debut album of the Japanese boy band, KAT-TUN. It was released on March 22, 2006, and debuted on the Oricon daily and weekly singles charts at number 1 where it stayed on the latter for 3 weeks. The song would eventually sell over a million copies by the end of 2006 and was named Japan's best-selling single of the year.
Song information.
There are two different versions of the song in KAT-TUN's discography. The single version is not the same song on "Best of KAT-TUN" which is named "Real Face #1" and features a different arrangement. "Real Face #1" was used as the theme song to band member Junnosuke Taguchi's drama two-part television movie, "Happy!", aired by TBS on April 7, 2006 and December 26, 2006 respectively.
Release and promotion.
The single was released in two pressings - a normal edition containing the instrumental versions of all the songs released in this single and six limited editions containing the three songs with a music video of the single focusing on each respective member. As such, there are seven different covers. It was part of a tripartite release by the group and became available in stores on the same day as KAT-TUN's debut album, "Best of KAT-TUN", and the tie-in DVD for the single, "Real Face Film". All three releases were also available as a box set which has since gone out of print.
KAT-TUN performed the song on television for the first time on "Music Station" on March 10, 2006 and sang on variety show "Utawara" two days later where they were already regular guests with Jun Matsumoto of Arashi. They followed up with their first appearance on "Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ" on March 13 and performed live at the Tokyo Dome on March 17 which was simulcast on "Music Station". The group were invited to "Utaban" for the first time on March 23 and performed on "Music Fighter" the day after. KAT-TUN rounded off the month by performing on "Music Station" for the third time in less than a month for the show's spring special episode on March 31.
Other subsequent promotional performances for the single were on "CDTV" (April 1), "Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ" (April 3), "Shōnen Club" (April 9 and 16), "Utawara" (April 16, May 14, July 30, September 17 and November 5), "Music Station" (April 28 and December 22) and NTV's "Minna Terebi 24 Hours TV" charity fundraiser special (August 26). KAT-TUN also acted as hosts of the latter event. The group also collaborated with Shikao Suga for a one-off live performance on "Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ" on May 12, 2008. Most recently on Shounen Club Premium last March, Kamenashi performed a rock version of Real Face with Suga Shikao, the person who wrote the song
Chart performance and reception.
The single displaced NEWS' double A-side single "Sayaendou/Hadashi no Cinderella Boy" from the top spot and stayed at number 1 for 3 weeks on the Oricon weekly singles chart, a feat rarely achieved in the Japanese music industry, selling over 754,234 copies in its first week which broke fellow JE boy band, Arashi's record for their debut single, "Arashi." By the end of the year, the single had sold over a million copies and was certified as the best-selling single of 2006 by Oricon. Real Face was reported in 2010 by the Oricon's magazine, OriStar, for having sold over 1,046,125 copies and was later certified Million by RIAJ denoting over 1,000,000 shipments.
The single was honored at the 21st Japan Gold Disc Awards when it was named "Single of the Year (Domestic)" and placed on the "Best 10 Singles (Domestic)" list along with "SIGNAL" and "Bokura no Machi de".

The LVG E.I was a German two-seat monoplane of World War I. The E.I was unusual among monoplanes of its time in that it featured ailerons as opposed to the then-conventional (for monoplanes) wing warping. 
It was fitted with both a rearward firing machine gun, mounted on a flexible ring mounting, and a forward firing synchronized machine gun and was very probably the first aircraft to be so armed.
The only prototype was destroyed on its way to the front for testing in 1915; as such, very little is known about the E.I, or its synchronization gear.

Tom Dempsey (hurler)

Tom Dempsey (born 1965 in Kilmuckridge, County Wexford) is a retired Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Buffer's Alley and with the Wexford senior inter-county team from 1984 until 2000.
Playing career.
Club.
Dempsey played his club hurling with the famous Buffer's Alley GAA club and enjoyed much success. He first came to prominence on the club’s senior team in the early 1980s as the team was in the middle of completing a four in-a-row of county championship titles between 1982 and 1985. This last county title was later converted into a Leinster club title for Dempsey, but his side was beaten by Kilruane MacDonagh's of Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. 1988 saw Dempsey won another county title before later adding a second Leinster club medal to his collection. Once again Buffer’s Alley reached the All-Ireland final, this time with O’Donovan Rossa of Antrim providing the opposition. Victory went to the Wexford men by 2-12 to 0-12, giving Dempsey a coveted All-Ireland club medal. He won another set of county medals in 1989 and 1991 before collecting a third Leinster club medal in the latter year. His side was later defeated by Sarsfield’s of Galway in the All-Ireland final. Dempsey finished off his career by winning a final county title in 1993.
Inter-county.
Dempsey first came to prominence as a dual player at minor level. He played both hurling and Gaelic football for Wexford in the under-18 grade, but he enjoyed little success. Dempsey later joined the county under-21 hurling team. Here he won a Leinster title in 1986 following victory in a replay over Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Galway provide the opposition. Dempsey’s side were completely outclassed on that occasion as Galway won by 1-14 to 2-5.
By this stage Dempsey had already made his debut with the Wexford senior team, but it was not a happy time to be a Wexford hurler. The county had been pushed back into third place in the Leinster Championship behind Kilkenny and Offaly. Provincial final appearances in 1988 and 1992 brought nothing but defeat for Dempsey’s team. In 1993 Dempsey was captain as Wexford looked set for glory when they reached the final of the National Hurling League. The opponents on that occasion were Cork; the game ended in a draw. The replay saw extra time being played, but both sides ended level once again. At the third attempt Cork emerged victorious by 3-11 to 1-12. In spite of this defeat expectations were still high for the Leinster championship. In the final of that competition Wexford drew with arch rivals and All-Ireland champions Kilkenny and there was hope of success. The replay was a different affair as Kilkenny won handily enough by 2-12 to 0-11.
Wexford were defeated in the Leinster final again in 1994 before disappearing from the championship at the first hurdle in 1995. By 1996 things were beginning to change in Wexford, thanks in no small way to the new manager Liam Griffin. Once again Dempsey lined out in the Leinster final. Offaly provided the opposition on that occasion; history was made as Wexford won by 2-23 to 2-15. It was Demspey’s first senior Leinster title and Wexford’s first since 1977. Wexford later defeated Galway in the penultimate game of the championship, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Limerick. The Munster men were slight favourites going into the game. They were the beaten finalists of 1994 and had already beaten Clare, the reigning champions, in the Munster Championship. The game was far from a classic, though it did provide excitement. Dempsey was the hero of the day as he scored a goal after nineteen minutes to give Wexford a major advantage. His side led by 1-8 to 0-10 at half-time in spite of having Éamonn Scallon sent off. Wexford took a four-point lead in the second-half; this was whittled back to two points as Wexford hung on for the last twenty minutes. The final score of 1-13 to 0-14 showed how vital Dempsey’s goal was. It was his first All-Ireland medal and Wexford’s first since 1968. Dempsey was later honoured with an All-Star award.
Dempsey captured a second Leinster medal in 1997 as Kilkenny fell in the provincial decider. 1997 saw the introduction of the so-called ‘back-door’ system whereby the defeated Munster and Leinster finalists were allowed back into the All-Ireland championship at the quarter-final stage. Because of this Wexford’s opponents in the All-Ireland semi-final were Tipperary, the Munster runners-up. On that occasion Wexford were outclassed by Tipp who won by 2-16 to 0-15. The next few years saw Wexford defeated in the early stages of the provincial championship. Dempsey retired from inter-county hurling in 2000.
Provincial.
Dempsey also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won his sole Railway Cup medal in 1993 as Leinster defeated Ulster.

Bogambara Stadium

Bogambara Stadium is one of the oldest grounds in the country. It is a multi-use stadium in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is currently used mostly for Rugby matches and hosts the games of the Singer Sri Lankan Airlines Rugby 7's. It has a capacity of 30,000.
Early history.
Bogambara Stadium was not only used for sports, it was also used for folk sports like elle, bahu, thattu, gudu etc.
Bogambara Stadium was converted from a lake to a playing field in the year 1897. At one time it was the site for carnivals, games circuses and gymkhana activities and even an execution ground during the British occupation.
Sports.
Bogambara Stadium serves as a venue for various sports ranging from Rugby, Football, Hockey, Athletics, Netball, Basketball, softball, and cricket.
Stadium Development.
Bogambara Stadium was renovated into a stadium in 1972, thanks to the Special Commissionership of late M.B. Samarakoon and E.W. Balasuriya the famous sports promoter for helping to do lot of good things with generous donations. In 1998, Anurudha Ratwatte, the former deputy defence minister was instrumental in converting the Bogambara stadium into an international standard stadium. It was re-developed under the patronage of the municipal council and presently the Sports Ministry owns the premises. The ground fees are on the higher side and the less affluent football and hockey clubs are finding it difficult to keep the game alive.

Soyuz TMA-01M

Soyuz TMA-01M was a Soyuz flight that transported three members of the Expedition 25 crew to the International Space Station. TMA-01M was the 107th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft, and the first flight of the modernized TMA-M series. The spacecraft remained docked to the space station during Expedition 25, to serve as an emergency escape vehicle. The spacecraft's COSPAR ID was 2010-052A.
Crew.
The Soyuz TMA-01M crew was confirmed by NASA on 21 November 2008.
Spacecraft.
Soyuz TMA-01M is the first spacecraft of the new modernized Soyuz TMA-M series, developed and built by RKK Energia as an upgrade of the baseline Soyuz-TMA, which has been in use since 2002. 36 obsolete pieces of equipment have been replaced with 19 new-generation devices and the vehicle's total mass has been reduced by 70 kilograms (154 lbs). In particular, the old Argon-16 computer control system, which has been used on Soyuz ships for more than 30 years, has been replaced with a new digital onboard computer, the TsVM-101. Power consumption has been reduced throughout the ship. There are also changes to the spacecraft's structure, such as replacing the magnesium alloy used in the instrument module frame by aluminum alloy, to make the ship easier to manufacture.
The modernized Soyuz ship will also enable engineers to test new equipment which may also be used in Russia's next generation manned space ship that is currently under development.
NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, part of Soyuz TMA-01M's crew, praised the ship's new displays, saying that they make flying easier and less operator intensive.
Two flight development tests are planned: Soyuz TMA-01M and Soyuz TMA-02M. The third ship, Soyuz TMA-03M will be used for qualification tests. In addition to verifying the nominal operation of the spaceship, the testing will include verification of off-nominal modes, such as manual attitude control, issuing of orbital maneuvering pulses using four berthing and attitude thrusters, and flying around the ISS in manual control mode.
After the launch of Soyuz TMA-01M, Russian space officials said the new spacecraft performed normally with no problems of any significance. "Soyuz TMA-01M is a digital spacecraft, digital vehicle. As you saw today, it worked extremely well, it was an automatic flight, 100 percent automatic," said Vitaly Lopota, president RSC Energia.
Mission highlights.
Launch.
The spacecraft lifted off aboard a Soyuz-FG rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 23:10:55 UTC on Thursday, 7 October 2010 (5:10:55 AM Friday at local time). In 9 minutes, the vehicle reached low earth orbit with the following parameters: min altitude – 199,85 km; max altitude – 258,77 km; revolution – 88,81 min; inclination– 51,63 degrees. Soon after the orbital insertion, the spacecraft unfolded its solar panels and antennas, and flight control gave the ship green light for starting its approach to the International Space Station.
Docking.
The Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft linked up with the space station at 00:01 UTC on Sunday, 10 October 2010, precisely one minute ahead of schedule. Docking to the Poisk module occurred when both spacecraft were flying more than 220 miles (354 km) above the southern Pacific Ocean, just off the coast from Chile. A few moments later, hooks and latches engaged to pull the spacecraft firmly into place and after extensive leak checks, hatches were opened at 03:09 UTC.
Landing.
Soyuz TMA-01M undocked from the Poisk module at 4:27 GMT on 16 March 2011. Slowing the spacecraft to begin the fall to Earth was initiated by a four-minute 17-second rocket firing starting at 7:03:17 GMT. Just before the atmospheric re-entry, the three modules making up the Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft separated as planned. Following a nominal re-entry, the central module carrying the crew touched down on its side at 7:54 GMT near Arkalyk in north central Kazakhstan. A few minutes later, Kaleri, Kelly and Skripochka were pulled from the capsule and placed in reclining chairs.
The weather at the landing side was harsh with high winds and viciously frigid temperatures. At one point in his live landing commentary, NASA spokesman Rob Navias said "You would think that was a scene out of the North Pole," to explain the extreme climatic conditions.

Trimeresurus xiangchengensis

Trimeresurus xiangchengensis is a venomous pit viper species endemic to south-central China. No subspecies are currently recognized. 
Taxonomy.
It should be noted that there is a genetic proposal to reassign this species to the genus "Protobothrops", as "Protobothrops xiangchengensis", because a "phylogeny of four mitochondrial gene regions suggests a revised taxonomy for Asian pitvipers ("Trimeresurus" and "Ovophis")".
Description.
Scalation includes 25 (23, 24) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 175-194/181-194 ventral scales in males/females, 54-66/44-62 subcaudal scales and 7-8 (9 or 10) supralabial scales.
Geographic range.
Found in China in the provinces of Yunnan and western Sichuan. According to David & Tong (1997), the type locality given is "Sichuan Province, Xiangcheng, altitude 3100 m ft".

Burr Caswell

Burr Caswell (1807–1896) was an American frontiersman.
Biography.
Early life.
Caswell was born at Glens Falls, New York, in 1807 with the given name of Aaron Burr although he always went by just the name "Burr." As a young man Caswell learned cabinet trade skills. He practiced this business for several years in Glens Falls.
In 1827 he married Hannah Green. They were married in Glens Falls where they remained for a few years. Caswell and his family afterwards made several changes in the next few years like many of the early settlers. They even went to Mississippi and were employed on the river boats. In 1842 Caswell and his family moved to Barrington Station, Lake County, Illinois. Here he bought a farm where he lived for three years.
Mid life.
Caswell by himself then in 1845 went to Pere Marquette Township in Mason County, Michigan, for a while. There he spent most of his time fishing at Duck Lake. He was there to 1847 and then returned to Illinois and got his family of six and moved back to Pere Marquette Township. A distant relative Frances Caswell Hanna in her book Sand Sawdust and Sawlogs relates the story of their arrival,
His family was the first family of white settlers in the area which was then considered a frontier. They lived in dense wilderness and rugged terrain. The closest white settlers were in Manistee some 20 miles away. Caswell got along well with the local Michigan Ottawa Indians. He learned their customs and religion. Caswell built a small two story frame house in 1849 out of old driftwood. It was the first frame structure in Mason County which still stands at White Pine Village very near its original location as the Mason County Historical Society's outdoor museum's centerpiece.
A book of 1882 titled History of Manistee, Mason, and Oceana Counties says, 
He continuely worked at improving his farm while working in the lumber industry. In 1855 when Mason County officially became a county Caswell turned over the first floor of his farmhouse to use for a courthouse and trading post. The family moved to the upstairs of the farmhouse. The Mason County Courthouse county seat was placed at Caswell's house from 1856 to 1861. For many years Caswell produced lumber from the local timber that was shipped to Chicago for construction. The village which sprang up around the Caswells was then called Pere Marquette. This was in honor of the missionary that died in the area in 1675.
Caswell and his eldest son were fishermen and trappers at first. They later worked at Baird and Bean Lumber Mill in downtown Ludington. Caswell was the first Mason County surveyor, coroner, probate judge and fish inspector. Caswell's wife, Hannah Green, died in 1870 and he then moved to downtown Ludington. He became the manager of a local shingle mill.
Later life.
In 1871 Caswell married again. His new wife's name was Sarah. They then moved into the Big Point Sable lighthouse in 1873 where Caswell became its keeper. They lived there for 5 years until 1878.
Caswell and his wife then went to Mitchell, South Dakota. Here they operated a large hotel. They were there until 1886. Caswell then returned to Ludington and 10 years later he died in 1896. Caswell is buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Ludington beside his first wife.
His September 17, 1896, obituary reads
Further family history.
Caswell's daughter Mary, that was born about 1835, married Richard Hatfield at the Caswell farmhouse in 1854. This was the first recorded marriage in Mason County. Mary died in 1882 at the age of 46 (if the birth date is correct). She was the mother of fourteen children, nine of whom preceded her in death. Helen, who was Mary's younger sister, was born about 1837. She married Sewell Moulton. Caswells last child was Edgar, who was born in 1840 in Illinois. He married Julia Genia 1871.

Edwin Vincent O'Hara

Edwin Vincent O'Hara (September 6, 1881 – September 11, 1956) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church.
Early life.
Edwin O'Hara was born in Lanesboro, Minnesota, as one of eight children. His parents emigrated from Ireland during the potato famine and settled in the United States. O'Hara studied at St. Paul's Seminary before moving to Oregon City. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 9, 1905, and then served as a chaplain during World War I.
Ministry.
After the war, O'Hara did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon, and was a leading force in enacting a minimum wage law through the state legislature in 1913; he later became the defendant in "Stettler v. O'Hara" when the law was tested and upheld in the U.S. Supreme Court in 1917. He was chosen to be chairman of the Oregon's Industrial Welfare Commission in 1913 as well. In 1923, he became founder and director of the National Catholic Rural Life Conference, inspired by his ministry to those who lived in sparsely populated areas. According to him, "The Church is the biggest single factor in building up rural communities."
On August 6, 1930, O'Hara was appointed the second Bishop of Great Falls, Montana by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 28 from Archbishop Edward Howard, with Bishops Charles White and Joseph Crimont, S.J., serving as co-consecrators. In 1931, he was the only American bishop present when Pius XI delivered his encyclical "Quadragesimo Anno", and spoke for the United States as delegates from each Christian nation reported the effects of "Rerum Novarum".
O'Hara was later named Bishop of Kansas City, Missouri on April 15, 1939. In 1940, he derided physicist Albert Einstein after the latter expressed his disbelief in a personal god, saying, "It is sad to see a man, who comes from the race of the Old Testament and its teaching, deny the great tradition of that race". Within his first ten years as Bishop, the diocese built or bought 42 churches, 31 rectories, 24 colleges, high schools, and grade schools, 14 convents, eight social centers, and six hospitals. Of the 30 churches he constructed in rural counties, 25 of them had never had a Catholic church before.
O'Hara was considered to be theologically liberal, particularly in the fields of liturgy and social justice. A proponent of Catholic Action, he encouraged lay involvement and appointed laypeople to several top diocesan positions. Some believed he went too far in his promotion of the laity, leading even his own chancellor to resign in disapproval. O'Hara also led the effort to revise the Bible in simpler terms. On June 29, 1954, he was granted the personal title of Archbishop.
Archbishop O'Hara died in Milan, Italy, shortly after his 75th birthday. He is buried in Kansas City.

Pharbaetus

Sheten or Šetennu, also known by the Greco-Roman name of Pharbaethus or Pharbaetus, was a town in the Nile Delta, capital of the nome of Pharbaethites/Lapt in Lower Egypt.
It is referred to in a stele of the 7th century BC, and described by Herodotus, Strabo, and Pliny.
The Greco-Roman name of Pharbaetus comes from the Egyptian "p" 'the' + "Hor abot", a popular name for "Hor-mer" (Horus of two eyes). This name is reproduced under the form Karbeuthos in George of Cyprus.
Ecclesiastical history.
The original diocese was a suffragan of Leontopolis, in Augustamnica Secunda, Egypt. 
There is a record of Bishop Arbetion at Nicæa in 325, and Bishop Theodorus in 1086, but it is possible that the latter was bishop of another Pharbætus situated further to the west, and which according to Vansleb was equally a Coptic see. John of Nikiu relates that under the Emperor Phocas (602-10) the clerics of the province killed the Greek governor Theophilus. 
It remains a Roman Catholic titular see under the name Pharbaetus.

Dokufest

Dokufest is an International Documentary and Short Film Festival that is held every year during August in Prizren, Kosovo. It started in 2002. This Festival attracts numerous international and regional artists. In this annually organized festival, films are designed to be screened throughout the day, in two open air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas accompanied with the program of activities. Except for its films, the festival is also well known for lively nights after the screening. Various events happen within the scope of the festival: workshops, DokuPhoto exhibitions, festival camping, concerts, which together turn the city into a lively and colorful place.
DokuFest, since its establishment has proven that through consistent work and dedication, a volunteer based organization with almost no funding at the beginning, could become one of the leading cultural organizations in Kosovo and the region. 
However, this path has often been associated with major difficulties due to the unique context that organization operated (post war situation, lack of similar referent events, lack of trust from institutions and potential donors etc.) as well as specific obstacles in running the film festival (lack of infrastructure, insufficient technical personnel and lack of local film production, to name a few). Inevitably, the circumstances led us to adopt trial and error methodology in first years prior to embarking on a more structured and consolidated modus of operation. This painful switch was achieved predominantly through motivated and mostly by committed voluntary work of its staff, making possible the growth and popularity that DokuFest enjoys today. This also proved a need to adopt higher professional standards in its structure and phase-out the volunteer based structure.
Initial consolidation of staffing structure started in 2008, through introduction of full-time and part-time contracts that led to the employment of a small number of staff. The need for an organizational structure arose when the organization became involved in implementation of yearly-based projects, in addition to organizing the festival. This led to the establishment of a core team that took over the design, planning and implementation of many initiatives resulting in successful implementation of several projects. 
To date DokuFest has proven not only as a leader when it comes to organization of large-scale cultural events, but also as a successful partner and driving force in the fields of culture, education and activism for sound cultural policies and alternative education system in Kosovo. 
The overall programme involves organization of:
(1) Annual International Documentary and Short Film Festival that includes screening of films in seven improvised cinema’s in the city of Prizren, photographic exhibition “DokuPhoto”, Workshops, Master Classes and debates, amongst others.
(2) Film training initiative called “Human Rights’s Film Factory - Stories from Kosovo’s Margins” that includes series of workshops for filmmakers, production of six documentaries on Human Rights coupled with series of human rights debates throughout Kosovo.
(3) Promotion of Human Rights and Democratic Values through Film that includes usage of human rights documentary films as educational tools and establishment of Kino Clubs in Highs Schools as well as Documentary film school guiding high school students from Kosovo throughout the process of transforming their film ideas into a finished documentary. The films will be screened in a special programme at DokuFest 2013.
(4) Travelling Cinema “Cinema at Your Door” aiming at documentary film screenings in rural areas of Prizren region coupled with discussions focusing on the difficulties that rural communities experience in their everyday life and the lack of the cultural activities in their surroundings.
(5) Part of larger NGO network working actively on environmental related issues and promotion of renewables in Kosovo. 
(6) Active participation and contribution on national and regional networks, aimed at development of sound cultural policies and organization of debates with relevant stakeholders, both in Kosovo and the region.
Awards.
In 2010 Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.

Sin miedo

Sin miedo (meaning "Without Fear") is the fourth studio album by Spanish singer Soraya.
Album information.
It is the album in which she has been more involved with, and the one which defines more her personal style, after two albums of covers. She even co-writes one of the songs, "Give Me Your Love"
There are 12 songs on this album: 10 original songs in Spanish and two covers in English: "Rebound" by the German group Monrose and Love Is All Around, originally by the Swedish singer Agnes.
The lead single off the album is "Sin miedo".
The second single, "La noche es para mí" was chosen as the Spanish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. It peaked in Spain at #9, being the highest position of a single by Soraya. It also charted in Sweden.
There is a duet with Kate Ryan called "Caminaré", which has been chosen as the third single. However, controversy came in late June 2009, when her label, Vale Music, did not want to pay the video for her single "Caminaré". Soraya stated on her official facebook that she will make the video on her own, without the support of Vale Music". However, as of September 2009, no news about the release of the video has been made. As well, the single release has been cancelled by her label.
The album is produced by DJ Sammy and the Ten brothers.
Chart performance.
The album debuted and peaked at #21, before slipping down the Spanish Albums Chart. The album was less successful than its predecessors, but plans to release the album throughout Europe still scheduled by her label, Universal, since Soraya has been chosen to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow. 
The album sold, in excess, 16,000 copies in Spain, being her worst charting and selling album to date. This was due to the poor promotion given to the album on TV and music stations, and due to the release of the single "Sin miedo" two weeks after the release of the album. The first single charted at #32 on the Spanish Singles Chart. 
The second single, "La noche es para mí," has peaked at #9 on the Spanish Singles Chart, and peaked at #25 on the Swedish Singles Chart. It is Soraya's most successful single so far.

Undervoltage-lockout

″
The Undervoltage-Lockout or UVLO is an electronic circuit used to turn off the power of an electronic device in the event of the voltage dropping below the operational value. For instance, in embedded devices, UVLOs can be used to monitor the battery charge or turn off the circuit if the battery voltage drops below a specific threshold, thus protecting the associated equipment. Some variants may also have an upper threshold.
Undervoltage lockout is an integral part of many electronic devices. For instance, it is widely used in many Electrical ballast circuits to switch them off in the event of voltage falling below the operational value.

Legend of the Seeker

Legend of the Seeker is a television series based on novels in the series titled "The Sword of Truth" by Terry Goodkind. Distributed in U.S. by Disney-ABC Domestic Television, ABC Studios produced the series, which was its first foray into broadcast syndication, with Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, Joshua Donen, Ned Nalle, and Kenneth Biller serving as executive producers. The show premiered on November 1, 2008 and ran for two seasons before its cancellation in 2010.
The series follows the journeys of long awaited Seeker named Richard Cypher (Craig Horner), a Confessor named Kahlan Amnell (Bridget Regan), a wizard named Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander (Bruce Spence), and a warrior named Cara (Tabrett Bethell) as they defend against tyranny and destruction. The story depicted in the television series substantially differs from that as portrayed in the written series.
Plot.
The story takes place in the world author Terry Goodkind created in his "The Sword of Truth" fantasy novel series. The three main provinces are Westland, the Midlands and D'Hara. Westland is separated from the Midlands by a magical boundary, which was created to prevent any magic from entering Westland. On the other side of the Midlands is D'Hara, which is ruled by Darken Rahl. Seekers are accompanied by a Wizard of The First Order and Confessors, an ancient order of women, who oversee the welfare of the people of the Midlands and the Seeker.
The first season is loosely based on the first book of "The Sword of Truth" series "Wizard's First Rule". Some of the stories feature events and characters not encountered in the books, while others loosely adapt events from the book. The story begins after the invasion of Darken Rahl's army into the Midlands. Kahlan Amnell, a Confessor, ventures into Westland in search of a wizard and the Seeker, who has been prophesied to defeat Rahl. Kahlan finds the wizard, Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander, and the Seeker, Richard Cypher, who is forced to accept his destiny. Together, they set off on a journey to seek out and defeat Darken Rahl. They soon discover that in the process of defeating Darken Rahl, they unintentionally helped the Keeper of the underworld create tears in the veil which separates the underworld from the world of the living. Richard's quest in the second season is to find the Stone of Tears to seal the rifts between the worlds and defeat the Keeper.
Episodes.
The series premiered on November 1, 2008 in the United States and was broadcast weekly on Saturday or Sunday, depending on the local television station. It is based on the novel Wizard's First Rule. In addition to the 22 episodes of the first season, the series was renewed by Disney for a second season. All aired episodes from the first season are free online at Hulu.
Filming of the second season started in July 2009; it was based on the sequel to "Wizard's First Rule", "Stone of Tears". The first episode aired on November 7, 2009. The season consisted of 22 episodes. Streamable episodes appeared on the show's official website, HuluPlus, and Netflix. They are currently available on Netflix and HuluPlus for active members (monthly subscription required).
Production.
Development.
Sam Raimi became interested in adapting "The Sword of Truth" novels after his business partner Joshua Donen encouraged him to read the books, and he in turn gave the books to Robert Tapert to read. Raimi considered adapting the first book into a movie or a five-part miniseries, but later settled on making a weekly television series after speaking to the books' author Terry Goodkind. A weekly television program would allow them to include most of the stories and important aspects of the series. Goodkind had resisted selling the rights of his books on multiple occasions before he met Raimi because he was not confident that other producers would maintain the integrity of his stories and characters. Raimi, who had produced ' and ' with Tapert and Ned Nalle, saw this as an opportunity to return to the first-run syndicated television business. However, the syndicated television business had diminished after the loss of crucial foreign markets and a gradual conversion of independent stations to UPN and WB programming that left little room for other syndicated dramas.
ABC Studios agreed to fund the project, making it its first venture into broadcast syndication, and greenlit the production for 22 episodes, after it was cleared for broadcast to stations representing 84% of the United States, with Tribune Company being the primary launch group. The show, which is heavily action-oriented and requires visual effects, was given a "network-sized" production budget of US$1.5 million per episode.
Originally named "Wizard's First Rule" (after the first book in "The Sword of Truth" series), the show was retitled to "Legend of the Seeker" at Goodkind's suggestion since the producers wanted to differentiate the show from the books, it would have been too restrictive for them to only include plotlines from the first book, and because this would allow them the opportunity to cover the story within all the books in the series.
Writing.
Executive producers Raimi and Tapert intended "Legend of the Seeker" to be "just about telling the stories of these characters and the sacrifices they make for each other. Sometimes it's about the meaning of real friendship. And always, it's the stories of the hero's journey." Tapert added, "We didn't want to have the '90s postmodern attitude where the audience is in on the joke. "Seeker" is much more serious than "Hercules" and "Xena"."
With show's production based in New Zealand and a writing staff based in Los Angeles, one of the biggest challenges has been dealing with the time differences and the communication issues. Kenneth Biller noted that the biggest challenges the writing staff faced were to create standalone episodes while integrating the storylines and mythology created by Terry Goodkind, and to "honor the books without literally translating them". As such, the series contains some stories from the books and new stories and events created by the series' writers. Raimi's reason for the changes is that the structure of a novel differs from a weekly one-hour television program. Tapert and Raimi maintain that while the writers have had to create events that are not portrayed in the books, they have remained faithful to the characters, themes and overarching story of the books:
Goodkind released a message to his readers on his official website prior to the show's production, saying: "No series (or mini-series, or feature film) can follow the underlying book exactly. Sam Raimi and his team want to keep the TV series true to my vision, so rest assured that I am going to be intimately involved in the writing of each of the episodes." He added, "If you love the book just the way it is, then enjoy the book for what it is and come to the TV series prepared to enjoy the show for what it is." However, after production started, Goodkind released another press statement in response to questions posed to him by fans: "I want you all to understand that ABC studios chose not to consult me on actors, scripts, or any other aspect of the show," he stated. "I have had no input whatsoever on the TV series, so I am the wrong person to write to or complain about the show. If you wish to make comments, positive or negative, please direct them to Disney/ABC." He continued, "For my part, I trust in Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert to at some point be able to exert their immense creative talent and do a great job at bringing to life the characters we all love."
Casting.
When casting the role of Richard Cypher, Tapert recalled that when he saw Craig Horner's audition tape, he "absolutely thought he was the guy, instantly". Raimi thought that although Horner is older than the character he plays (even though he really isn't), he was "very believable" and that "he's got enough good qualities in him, in real life, and he will probably make the audience believe that he's taking that ride towards making a responsible person and that growth of character that's so important for me in the stories of Terry Goodkind." Horner had not heard of the books prior to the audition, and was convinced by a friend to read the books and try out for the role.
For the role of Kahlan Amnell, Raimi credits Tapert for finding Bridget Regan, whom he saw on one of the audition tapes they received. Raimi thought that she grounded the fantastical situations by being "very human and real", and recalled, "I was moved by her and I believed her and I thought we couldn't ask for anything more." Like Horner, Regan had not read the books prior to the audition. Horner and Regan were brought together for a "chemistry reading" in Los Angeles, upon which the producers concurred that they had found their two lead actors.
Filming.
Production was set to begin in May 2008, but it was delayed by six weeks. The series was shot entirely in New Zealand in high-definition. Though based in Auckland, filming took place in various places in and outside of the city: at Henderson Valley Studios, in the city's outskirts and in the mountainous region around Queenstown.
Cancellation.
Tribune, the major distributor of the series, decided not to renew the series on March 4, 2010, but according to a statement from ABC Studios, this was not a deciding factor of its cancellation. After an apparent deal with Syfy fell through, on April 26 Ausiello Files reported that "Legend of the Seeker" had been cancelled and would not return for a third season. Fans of the series responded by launching an ongoing renewal campaign titled ""Save Our Seeker"". Terry Goodkind has expressed his support for the campaign.
Response.
Ratings.
"Legend of the Seeker" premiered on the weekend of November 1–2, 2008 in the United States and attracted more than 4.1 million viewers over the two days. The first two episodes obtained an average of 1.5/3 Nielsen rating among 54 metered markets with a 1.4/3 rating on Saturday and a 1.7/3 rating on Sunday. In addition to improving its broadcast time periods in several top markets, "Legend" also improved the audience numbers in the key 18 to 49 year old demographic in all airings. Over its first month of airing, the show averaged more than 3.6 million viewers. It was renewed for a second season after obtaining a 2.0 household rating average for its first ten episodes.
Critical reception.
The series premiere, which consisted of the first two episodes, received generally mixed reviews from critics, earning a 53 out of 100 average rating as calculated by Metacritic. It was criticized for not being as "fun" as ' and ' (also produced by Robert Tapert and Sam Raimi), and not having enough excitement. Another complaint about the show was its lack of distinguishing features and that it was "too derivative of other works" like "Star Wars" and "The Matrix", with the ""300"-style" slow-motion action sequences often cited as an example. Brian Lowry from "Variety" called the show "a hodgepodge of better sci-fi/fantasy fare", while Ray Richmond from "The Hollywood Reporter" described it as "ig on style but more challenged in terms of substance" with "too little provocative/evocative interaction aside from the ultra-violent kind".
"Legend of the Seeker" was praised for its high production value and the use of New Zealand exteriors, with Robert Lloyd from "Los Angeles Times" commenting that the show is basically "good-looking fun". Although both Lloyd and Diane Steenbergen from IGN commended the performances of the lead actors Craig Horner and Bridget Regan, they were not pleased with the supporting performances. Steenbergen thought that the series' third episode was "far more entertaining than the previous two that were weighed down with too much exposition."
Awards.
In 2009, the series won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series. In 2010, the series was nominated for an Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music Emmy. In 2011, Costume Designer Jane Holland, Cinematographer Kevin Riley, and Sound Designer Chris Burt all won awards at the Aotearoa Film & Television Awards for their outstanding work on "Legend of the Seeker."

Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009

Switzerland competed in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. The Swiss broadcaster, SRG SSR idée suisse, internally selected Lovebugs to represent the country with the song "The Highest Heights". The song did not progress from the first semi-final of the competition.
Background.
Switzerland debuted at Eurovision at the first contest in 1956, and will send its 50th entry to the 2009 contest. The country has won the contest twice: their first win occurred at the very first contest, when Lys Assia won for Switzerland with "Refrain" when the contest was held in Switzerland, in the town of Lugano; their second and latest win to date came in 1988, when Canadian singer Céline Dion won with "Ne partez pas sans moi". The country, however, has also come last in the contest on five occasions: in 1964, 1967, 1974, 1998 and in the semi-final of the 2004 Contest.
The Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR idée suisse has been in charge of the Swiss Eurovision entry since its interception. In the past the organistaion has held a national final to select the Swiss entry to Eurovision, with each regional broadcaster entering songs to the contest. Since 2005, however, the organisation has held an internal selection for the Swiss Eurovision entry, which was continued for the 2009 selection.
Selection.
Schweizer Fernsehen (SF), the German-language sector of SRG SSR, began its selection for Eurovision 2009 in July 2008. From July to 20 October 2008 SF held an open call for artists interested in Eurovision. Artists and authors wishing to enter were not obliged to be Swiss citizens, however SF stressed that the experience of possible candidates was vital. An internal jury will select the final entry for Switzerland for the contest.
After months of deliberation, Swiss newspaper Blick claimed in January 2009 that SF had selected the popular Swiss band the Lovebugs to represent Switzerland at the 2009 Contest in Moscow, Russia. SF confirmed on 19 January that the Lovebugs had been selected by the five-person jury appointed by the broadcaster to represent Switzerland at Eurovision. No information has yet been disclosed on the song the band will sing in Moscow, however a poll held by Swiss radio station DRS, part of SF, on their website showed that readers preferred "The Highest Heights" over other songs on their new album of the same name.
On 23 February, it was finally announced that the Lovebugs will compete at the contest with "The Highest Heights". The group will compete in the first semi-final on 12 May 2009. They failed to qualify for the finals of the contest.
At Eurovision.
Since Switzerland is not one of the "Big Four" and is not the host of the 2009 contest, it had to compete in one of the two semi-finals. The song competed in the first semi-final but failed to reach the final.

Morane-Saulnier G

__NOTOC__
The Morane-Saulnier G was a sports aircraft produced in France in the years before the First World War. It was a development of the racing monoplanes designed by Léon Morane and Raymond Saulnier after leaving Borel and, like its predecessors, was a wire-braced, shoulder-wing monoplane. Construction was of fabric-covered wood throughout, except for the undercarriage struts which were of steel tube.
The type was a sporting success. In April 1913, Roland Garros took second place in the inaugural Schneider Cup in a floatplane version, finishing with a time of 40 minutes 40 seconds. On 26 June, Claude Grahame-White flew another float-equipped example from Paris to London via Le Havre, Boulogne-sur-Mer, and Dover, covering some that day. Between 21 and 28 September the same year, two float-equipped Type Gs competed at the seaplane meeting at San Sebastián, with Lord Carbery winning the short take-off prize on one, and Edmond Audemars winning the maneuverability prize on the other. The following week, Carbery flew his Type G in the Italian Waterplane Contest from Lake Como to Pavia and back, along with two other Type Gs in the field of fifteen competitors, these flown by Garros and Morane. Garros not only won the Grand Prize in the "general class", but also the prizes for best speed (127.7 km/h, 79.8 mph) and greatest altitude (2,100 m, 6,000 ft).
In 1914, Russian manufacturer Duks arranged to build the type under licence at their Moscow factory for the Russian Army, and the same year, the Turkish military ordered 40 examples. Before these could be delivered, however, war broke out, and the aircraft were impressed into the French Army. To these, the Army soon added an order of 94 aircraft, and the British Royal Flying Corps also acquired a number, these latter machines purchased from Grahame-White, who was manufacturing the type in the UK under licence. At the outbreak of war, the type's military value was found to be wanting, and the French machines were quickly relegated to training duties.
Despite this, a dedicated single-seat fighter version was built in 1915, armed with an 8 mm Hotchkiss machine gun that fired through the propeller arc, the propeller blades being protected by deflector plates. Only one or two prototypes were built, and the type never entered service.
Some Type Gs were modified by Morane-Saulnier to have their wings mounted above the fuselage, parasol-fashion, rather than at the fuselage sides. This arrangement was found to offer far better visibility for the pilot, and formed the basis for the Morane-Saulnier L.
A Type G is preserved at the Museo del Aire de Cuatrovientos in Madrid.

Kitanglad Mountain Range

Kitanglad Mountain Range is a mountain range that dominates the northern central portion of the province of Bukidnon. It occupies portions of eight of the municipalities and cities in the province such as Talakag, Baungon, Libona, Manolo Fortich, Impasug-ong, Lantapan and Malaybalay City. The range is one of the few remaining rainforests in the Philippines, hosting one of the most important diverse species of rare and endemic wildlife such as the Philippine Eagle. Five of its peaks have very high elevations: Mount Dulang-dulang, the highest at 2,938 meters; Mount Kitanglad at 2,899 meters; Mount Maagnaw at 2,742 meters; Mount Lumuluyaw at 2,612 meters; and Mount Tuminungan at 2,400 meters.
The name ""kitanglad"" was derived from a legend that there was once a great flood that submerged the native lands of Bukidnon and only the tip of the mountain, the size of a ""tanglad"" (lemon grass), remained visible (""kita"" in Cebuano).
The whole range was declared a national park by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 677 on December 4, 1990 known as the Mount Kitanglad Range Natural Park. In 1994, it was chosen as one of the 10 priority sites under the World Bank through the Conservation of Priority Protected Areas Project. Mount Kitanglad and its outlying area was proclaimed a protected area under the natural park category through Presidential Proclamation 896 dated October 24, 1996. On November 9, 2000, the park finally became a full-pledge protected area when Congress approved R.A. 8978 also known as the Mt. Kitanglad Range Protected Area Act of 2000.
Geographical Location.
Kitanglad Mountain Range is located in the northern central part of Bukidnon province, directly north of the neighboring Kalatungan Mountain Range. It lies in between 8°7′42″N and 124°55′30″E. It is bounded in the west by Talakag, northwest by Baungon, on the north by Libona and Manolo Fortich, on the northeast by Impasug-ong, on the east by Malaybalay City and on the south by Lantapan.
Climate.
The climate at the Kitanglad Ranges falls under the Modified Corona Classification, which is characterized by a short dry season usually lasting from one to three months, and no pronounced rainy season. The area is cloud-covered all year round.
Temperature ranges from 22.7°C in January to 24.6 °C in June. It receives the highest amount of rainfall in June. The driest period is March.
Hydrological Features.
The Kitanglad Mountain Range forms the headwater catchment area of several major river systems draining north and central Mindanao. Among these rivers are the Cagayan River, Tagoloan River, and Pulangi River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande de Mindanao. Drainage in the area is in a characteristic radial pattern, emanating from the highest points in the range..

Polystylus (place)

Polystylus is the name of an ancient town and bishopric in the late Roman province of Macedonia Secunda, whose metropolis was Philippi. Its name is given in this form in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees. A 1911 article by Sophrone Pétridès called it Polystylum.
Identity.
John VI Kantakouzenos, who restored and fortified the city, stated that it was the ancient Abdera, a statement that also occurs in a Byzantine list of names of cities published by Parthey. Pétridès rejected this identification, saying that Polystylus/Polystylum was what in his time (1911) was called Bouloustra, a village situated 5 or 7 kilometres from the ruins of ancient Abdera, and which is now called Abdera. 
History of the see.
When Philippi was made a metropolitan see Polystylum was one of its suffragans. It figures as such in: the "Notitiæ episcopatuum" of Leo the Wise about 901-7; the "Nova Tactica" about 940; "Notices" 3 and 10 of Parthey, which belong to the 13th century. In 1212 Pope Innocent III mentions it among the suffragans of the Latin Archdiocese of Philippi.
In 1363 the Greek bishop Peter became Metropolitan of Christopolis and the see was united to the Archdiocese of Maronia, the metropolitan see of Rhodope.

France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009

Patricia Kaas, one of France's most successful musical artists, represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 on 16 May 2009 in Moscow, Russia. The French broadcaster France Télévisions once again used an internal selection as it had in the past to choose the song "Et s'il fallait le faire", which was the first single from Kaas's next album, "Kabaret".
Background.
France was one of the seven countries to compete in the very first contest in 1956. The country's first win came in 1958, with André Claveau's "Dors, mon amour" (Sleep, my love). France is one of Eurovision's most successful countries, having won the contest five times in total. However, its last victory came in 1977, over 30 years ago, and more recent French entries in the contest have been less successful, with very few entries reaching the top 5 since the 1980s.
France has been represented at Eurovision by a total of four different broadcasting organisation: Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française (RTF) was the first French broadcaster to organise the French Eurovision participation; RTF was dissolved in 1964, and was replaced by Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (ORTF), who took over in 1965. In 1974 ORTF was also dissolved, and was replaced by seven different institutions. Télévision Française 1 took over the French Eurovision participation in 1975, and continued until 1982, when the broadcaster withdrew voluntarily from the 1982 contest. The head of entertainment at the time, Pierre Bouteiller, said, "The absence of talent and the mediocrity of the songs were where annoyance set in. is a monument to inanity translated as 'drivel'." Antenne 2 took over from TF1 in 1983, and its current incarnation, France Télévisions, has continued to organise France's Eurovision entry since.
Selection.
Bruno Berberes, the head of the French delegation, stated that a "lovely surprise" was in store for the 2009 French representative, thanks to 2008's experience with Sébastien Tellier who created considerable interest among French show business for the contest. It was decided that a big name would be lined up to represent France at Eurovision in Moscow, someone with a large and popular notoriety. Since Tellier's popularity increased after his participation, Eurovision was discovered to be a great advertising campaign. For example, his Eurovision entry in 2008, "Divine", is now a part of the new advertising campaign for Renault Mégane. Moreover, the competition in France has been open to different music styles since 2007, which encouraged contacts with key national and international companies in the choice of representatives. "We need a large company to cover the costs of participation and to promote our video," says the head of the delegation.
France Télévisions confirmed on 30 January that popular French singer Patricia Kaas had agreed to represent France at the 2009 contest in Moscow. Rumours of Kaas' possible participation at Eurovision first arose in early January, after an article was published by Belgian newspaper "La Meuse". The news was originally denied by Kaas' management, however, her manager later confirmed that preparations were being made between Kaas and France Télévisions for her participation. Kaas officially confirmed on France 2's talk show "Vivement Dimanche", pre-recorded for broadcast on 8 February, that she would represent France at Eurovision in 2009. On 1 February, Kass revealed that "Et s'il fallait le faire", the first single from her next album "Kabaret", would be the song she would compete with at Eurovision.
Promotion.
Kaas spent some time promoting her entry before Eurovision in France and Europe. Kaas performed her Eurovision entry at the Russian national final on 7 March, and also performed her entry on the French talent show Star Academy, as a duet with one of the contestants.
At Eurovision.
France automatically pre-qualified for the final of the contest as one of the "Big Four". France Télévisions are obliged to the second semi-final on 14 May 2009, where French viewers had the ability to vote. France performed third in the running order of the final and finished in 8th place. Although France finished in 8th place, they only received one top three vote the entire show, a 10 points from Russia. France was the only country in the top sixteen of the final to receive just one top three score.
France Télévisions revealed that their commentators for the Eurovision final were TV host and actor Cyril Hanouna and journalist and radio/TV producer Julien Courbet, broadcast on France 3. Only the second semi-final of the contest was broadcast on France 4, where the commentators were Peggy Olmi and Yann Renoard.

Water treader

Water treaders, the superfamily Mesovelioidea are insects in the order Hemiptera, the true bugs. They are semi-aquatic insects that live in moist and wet habitat and on wet plant matter in several types of aquatic habitat.
These insects are no more than 3.5 millimeters long. They have elongated heads, long antennae, and large eyes, with the exception of "Cryptovelia", which have vestigial eyes. Females are larger than the males of their species and have well developed ovipositors.
The type genus, "Mesovelia", contains about 27 species, many of which are common and widespread. The other genera are small or even monotypic, and are less common. 
One species is known for its unique specific name, "Cavaticovelia aaa", sometimes called the aaa water treader. It is a legitimate binomial name featuring "aaa", the Hawaiian word for "lava tube".
According to some treatments, there are two families in the Mesovelioidea. In others, the family Madeoveliidae is treated as a subfamily of Mesoveliidae.

DRG Class 02

The German DRG Class 02 ("Baureihe 02" or "BR 02") engines were standard ("Einheitslokomotiven") express train locomotives with the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft. Number 02 001 was the first "Einheitsdampflokomotive" in the DRG to be completed.
In procuring a standard express train steam locomotive, the Deutsche Reichsbahn carried out a comparison between a superheated two-cylinder type (the DRG Class 01) and a four-cylinder compound locomotive (the Class 02). Ten examples of each type were built from 1925, and the Class 02 vehicles were given operating numbers 02 001 – 02 010. The first eight engines were manufactured in 1925 by the firm of Henschel, two more were built in 1926 by Maffei.
Because the Class 02 steam engines were badly designed, the compound engine could only produce a high level of power at speeds of over 70 km/h. In addition, below 1000 PSi its steam consumption was higher than that of the Class 01.
Compared with the Class 01s, these engines had a complicated, and therefore maintenance-intensive, drive; as a result no more were ordered. From 1937 to 1942 the vehicles were successively converted to two-cylinder operation and regrouped as Class 01s with the new numbers 01 011 and 01 233 – 01 241. 
The first eight engines were equipped with 2'2' T 30 tenders; the other two with 2'2 T 32 tenders. Later on, the second tender was coupled to all of the first eight engines as well.

Horsfield's fruit bat

Horsfield's fruit bat "(Cynopterus horsfieldii)" is a species of megabat native to South East Asia. It is named for Thomas Horsfield, an American naturalist who presented the type specimen to the British Museum.
Description.
Horsfield's fruit bat is a medium-sized megabat, intermediate in size between flying foxes and pygmy fruit bats. Adults weigh around , and have light grey to brown fur, with a reddish brown or orange mantle around the shoulders. In some males the mantle extends across the chest, and the fur is often brighter in colour than in females. The rim of the ears and the skin overlying the metacarpals and phalanges within the wing are white. Juveniles have a more bland coat pattern, with uniformly dull buff or grey fur.
The bats have a short, broad snout, ending in a pair of almost tubular nostrils. Both the eyes and ears are large, although the latter have a simpler structure than in most other bats, and lack a tragus. The wings have a low aspect ratio and high wing loading, typical of many megabats, and indicating a relatively slow flight speed and moderate manoeuvrability.
Distribution and habitat.
Horsfield's fruit bat is found in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Within this region, it inhabits a broad range of lowland habitats, from dense primary rain forest to agricultural land and suburban gardens.
There are four recognised subspecies: 
Biology and behaviour.
Horsfield's fruit bats eat the fruit of strangler figs, "Elaeocarpus", and "Payena", and the flowers of bitter beans. They have been reported to pluck fruit from trees and carry it to roosts elsewhere in order to feed. During the dry season, hen fruit is in short supply, they instead feeds on pollen, which they take from a wide variety of different plants.
They live in small groups, consisting of a single adult male and up to five females and their young. Although these groups are maintained year round, individual females often move between different groups, and may spend some time nesting alone between leaving one group and joining another. They roost in trees and cave mouths, reportedly favouring banana trees. They often modify their roosting sites by constructing tents from the leaves, partly cutting through them to make an inverted "V" shape. 
They breed throughout the year, but most commonly give birth at two times of the year: between February and March and between July and August. They have been reported to live for at least 31 months.

Perséphone (Stravinsky)

Perséphone ("Persephone") is a musical work ("mélodrame") for speaker, solo singers, chorus, dancers and orchestra with music by Igor Stravinsky and a libretto by André Gide.
It was first performed under the direction of the composer at the Opéra, Paris on April 30, 1934 in a double bill with the ballet "Diane de Poitiers" by Jacques Ibert. The premiere was staged by the ballet company of Ida Rubinstein, with Rubinstein herself dancing and speaking the part of Persephone and the tenor René Maison singing Eumolphe.
It was also premiered at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires under Stravinsky himself in 1934, and then in Rio de Janeiro. Victoria Ocampo, an important intellectual from Argentina, was present at the premier in Buenos Aires. It was reprised at the Colón in 1995 with China Zorrilla under Pedro Ignacio Calderón.
Other choreographed versions have included those of George Balanchine, Kurt Jooss (1955), Frederick Ashton (1961), and Pina Bausch (1965). (Martha Graham's "Persephone," ironically, is accompanied by Stravinsky's Symphony in C.)
It was recorded by Stravinsky himself with Vera Zorina and also under André Cluytens (with Nicolai Gedda, 1955, Paris), Sir Andrew Davis (with Paul Groves, London) and Michael Tilson Thomas (with Stuart Neill, 1999, San Francisco).

Barony of Peacockbank

The Barony of Peacockbank was in the old feudal Baillerie of Cunninghame, near Stewarton in what is now East Ayrshire, Scotland.
The history of Peacockbank.
Dobie records that this Barony, called of old the 'Barony of Balgray' was given by the Earl of Eglinton to Sir Neil Montgomerie in 1616. These lands included Fullwoods, Gabroch-Hills, Auchentibers, etc. It was transferred by 'Clare Constat' which was an instrument by which legal ownership of land is transferred. It is a deed executed by a subject-superior for the purpose of completing the title as his vassal's heir to the lands held by the deceased vassal. Papers in the National Archives of Scotland of 1654 refer to the Barony of Peacockbank and the properties of Over and Nether Peacockbank, together with the corn mill, toun, etc.
In 1691 the Hearth Tax records show that Robert Catherwood lived in Peacockbank and had tenants: Mathew Longmure, Andrew Catherwood and William Walker.
In 1820 John Deans is the proprietor of Peacock-bank, which had a rental value of £127 13s. 4d. and is given as being ""remarkably well cultivated"". James Dunlop gave the Barony of Peacockbank to his son Alexander upon his marriage in 1667.
Peacockbank Farm has seen many changes, with the coming of the railway came the impressive viaduct and the new road to Kilmaurs and Kilmarnock was built very close to it. The course of the old entrance drive to Lochridge House was changed by the railway company and the original drive ran down past the old Tollhouse, on the site of the 'roads department' sand & salt store, to join the Irvine to Stewarton road has gone completely, apart possibly from the position of the gate. The field above was called 'Kiln Field', but no remains of any kiln exist. The field bisected by the railway at the viaduct was known as 'Bonfire Field' and may have been used for Beltane fires, etc. Fore Croft Park ran up to Peacockbank from near the old mill. The field above Peter's Brae was called Rye Hill Park.
The murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton.
In April 1586, Hugh, 4th. Earl of Eglinton was travelling to Stirling to join the court having been commanded to attend by the King, accompanied only by a few domestic servants. He stopped at Lainshaw Castle to dine with his close relative, a Montgomerie who was Lord of Lainshaw and who's Lady was a Margaret Cunninghame of Aiket Castle, with sisters were married to John Cunninghame of Corsehill and David Cunninghame of Robertland. It seems that a plot to kill the Earl as an act of revenge had been organised by Lady Montgomerie.
After the murder Lady Margaret Montgomerie was said to have fled to Ireland, however it seems that she actually remained close by, living with an estate tenant, one Robert Barr and family at Pearce Bank farm, now High Peacockbank. She was eventually permitted to return to her husband and home, however she never again left the grounds of Lainshaw Castle and she avoided any contact with the Montgomerie family for the remainder of her days.

Adolf Noreen

Adolf Gotthard Noreen (13 March 1854 Östra Ämtervik, Sunne Municipality – 13 June 1925 Uppsala) was a Swedish linguist who served as a member of the Swedish Academy from 1919 until his death.
Biography.
Noreen was born in Värmland. He became a student at Uppsala University in 1871 and went on to complete his doctorate there in 1877; he became a lecturer at the university in the same year. Noreen spent most of 1879 at the University of Leipzig, the home of the Neogrammarian school of linguistics - a school to which Noreen belonged for his entire literary life. Whilst in Leipzig, Noreen was taught Lithuanian by August Leskien, a pioneer of research into sound laws.
Much of Noreen's early output was focused on Swedish dialectology, primarily in his home province of Värmland and the neighbouring province of Dalarna. His work, which was the first in Sweden to utilise the findings of the Neogrammarians, remained influential in the field well into the 20th century. Noreen's academic focus in the 1880s shifted to the field of historical linguistics, primarily centred on the Germanic languages. His grammars of Old West Norse and Old Swedish remain in use by scholars to the present day. In 1887 Noreen was named as the third Professor of Scandinavian languages at Uppsala University. Noreen devoted the last twenty years of his life to writing "Vårt språk" ("Our Language"), an ultimately unfinished work in which he outlines his view of the Swedish language, its grammar, phonology and morphology. Noreen was elected to Seat 12 of the Swedish Academy in 1919, following the death of Gustaf Retzius.
Noreen is buried at Uppsala gamla kyrkogård.

USS Rosewood (AN-31)

USS "Rosewood" (YN-26/AN-31) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was later transferred to the French Navy as "Libellule" (A730). She was sunk as a target near Brest in 1983.
Career.
"Rosewood" (YN-26) was laid down 18 October 1940 by the American Ship Building Company, Lorain, Ohio; launched 1 March 1941; and placed in service 13 September 1941, Lt. D. Nicoli, Jr., USNR, in command.
Following transit of the St. Lawrence River, "Rosewood" moved down the U.S. East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, and through the next spring operated as a net tender in the 5th Naval District. Commissioned 18 June 1942, she was ordered to Service Squadron 6 for duty in the Pacific Ocean. 
She departed Norfolk 26 July, arrived at Espiritu Santo 19 October, and for over a year tended nets and performed escort duties in the New Hebrides area. During that time, on 20 January 1944, she was redesignated "AN-31".
Detached a year later, "Rosewood" departed Espiritu Santo on 17 January 1945. At Manus at the end of the month, she continued on to the Western Caroline Islands in February, and into June served at Ulithi. Two months duty at Eniwetok followed and on 6 August she sailed for California.
From 1 September to 6 December "Rosewood" served in the San Pedro, California, area. She then headed north and on 24 December reported for duty in the 13th Naval District. On 17 April 1946 she reported to the Commander, 19th Fleet for inactivation.
Decommissioned 10 June 1946, she remained in the Reserve Fleet for 16 years. In September 1962 she was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration for lay-up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. On 28 October 1968, however, she was returned to the Navy for sale, under the terms of the Military Assistance Program, to France. Delivered to the French Navy in January 1969, she served as "Libellule" until 21 April 1981 and was sunk as a target, near Brest in 1983.

Perospirone

Perospirone (Lullan) is an atypical antipsychotic of the azapirone family. It was introduced in Japan by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma in 2001 for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute cases of bipolar mania.
Medical uses.
Its primary uses are in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania.
Schizophrenia.
In a clinical trial that compared it to haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia it was found to produce significantly superior overall symptom control. In another clinical trial perospirone was compared with mosapramine and produced a similar reduction in total PANSS score, except with respect to the blunted affect part of the PANSS negative score, in which perospirone produced a significantly greater improvement. In an open-label clinical trial comparing aripiprazole with perospirone there was no significant difference between the two treatments discovered in terms of both efficacy and tolerability. In 2009 a clinical trial found that perospirone produced a similar reduction of PANSS score than risperidone and the extrapyramidal side effects was similar in both frequency and severity between groups.
A meta-analysis published in 2013 found that it is statistically significantly less efficacious than other second-generation antipsychotics.
Adverse effects.
Has a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than the other atypical antipsychotics, but still less than that seen with typical antipsychotics. A trend was observed in a clinical trial comparing mosapramine with perospirone that favoured perospirone for producing less prominent extrapyramidal side effects than mosapramine although statistical significant was not reached. It may produce less QT intervalprolongation than zotepine, as in one patient who had previously been on zotepine switching to perospirone corrected their prolonged QT interval. It also tended to produce less severe extrapyramidal side effects than haloperidol in a clinical trial comparing the two (although statistical significance was not reached).

<doc id="18617142" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18617142" title="Mercury (element)">
Mercury (element)

Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum (from Greek "hydr-" "water" and "argyros" "silver"). A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature.
Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion, a pure form of mercuric sulfide, is mostly obtained by reaction of mercury (produced by reduction from cinnabar) with sulfur. Cinnabar is highly toxic by ingestion or inhalation of the dust. Mercury poisoning can also result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), inhalation of mercury vapor, or eating seafood contaminated with mercury.
Mercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, fluorescent lamps and other devices though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favour of alternatives such as alcohol or galinstan-filled glass thermometers, thermistor or infrared-based electronic instruments. Likewise mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. It remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam material for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in lighting: electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.
Properties.
Physical properties.
Mercury is a heavy, silvery-white metal. As compared to other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity. Mercury has a freezing point of −38.83 °C and a boiling point of 356.73 °C, which are exceptionally low for a metal, and it is the only elemental metal known to melt at a generally cold temperature. A complete explanation of this delves deep into the realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Since this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gas elements, which form weak bonds and become solids which melt easily at relatively low temperatures.
The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner "f" shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.
On the other hand, gold, which is one space to the left of mercury on the periodic table, has atoms with one less 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds.
Chemical properties.
Mercury does not react with most acids, such as dilute sulfuric acid, although oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride salts. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. Mercury even reacts with solid sulfur flakes, which are used in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury vapors (spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc).
Amalgams.
Mercury dissolves many other metals such as gold and silver to form amalgams. Iron is an exception and iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals with the exception of manganese, copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum and a few other metals. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.
Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.
Mercury embrittlement is the most common type of liquid metal embrittlement.
Isotopes.
There are seven stable isotopes of mercury with being the most abundant (29.86%). The longest-lived radioisotopes are with a half-life of 444 years, and with a half-life of 46.612 days. Most of the remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than a day. and are the most often studied NMR-active nuclei, having spins of and respectively.
History.
Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that date from 1500 BC.
In China and Tibet, mercury use was thought to prolong life, heal fractures, and maintain generally good health, although it is now known that exposure to mercury leads to serious adverse health effects. The first emperor of China, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì — allegedly buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury on a model of the land he ruled, representative of the rivers of China — was killed by drinking a mercury and powdered jade mixture formulated by Qin alchemists (causing liver failure, mercury poisoning, and brain death) who intended to give him eternal life.
The ancient Greeks used mercury in ointments; the ancient Egyptians and the Romans used it in cosmetics which sometimes deformed the face. In Lamanai, once a major city of the Maya civilization, a pool of mercury was found under a marker in a Mesoamerican ballcourt. By 500 BC mercury was used to make amalgams (Medieval Latin amalgama, "alloy of mercury") with other metals.
Alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter from which all metals were formed. They believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.
Hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury. It comes from "hydrargyrum", a Latinized form of the Greek word Ύδραργυρος ("hydrargyros"), which is a compound word meaning "water-silver" (hydr- = water, argyros = silver) — since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver. The element was named after the Roman god Mercury, known for speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet Mercury; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal; the Sanskrit word for alchemy is "Rasavātam" which means "the way of mercury". Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name.
The mines in Almadén (Spain), Monte Amiata (Italy), and Idrija (now Slovenia) dominated mercury production from the opening of the mine in Almadén 2500 years ago, until new deposits were found at the end of the 19th century.
Occurrence.
Mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust, having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 0.08 parts per million (ppm). However, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar, corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore. Mercury ores usually occur in very young orogenic belts where rock of high density are forced to the crust of the Earth, often in hot springs or other volcanic regions.
Beginning in 1558, with the invention of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almaden in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies. Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.
Former mines in Italy, the United States and Mexico which once produced a large proportion of the world supply have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46 kg) flask.
Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor. The equation for this extraction is
In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents.
Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning. In China, prison labor was used by a private mining company as recently as the 1950s to create new cinnabar mercury mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels. In addition, worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.
The European Union directive calling for compact fluorescent bulbs to be made mandatory by 2012 has encouraged China to re-open deadly cinnabar mines to obtain the mercury required for CFL bulb manufacture. As a result, environmental dangers have been a concern, particularly in the southern cities of Foshan and Guangzhou, and in the Guizhou province in the south west.
Abandoned mercury mine processing sites often contain very hazardous waste piles of roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 Santa Clara County, California purchased the historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine and created a county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.
Chemistry.
Mercury exists in two main oxidation states, I and II. Higher oxidation states are unimportant, but have been detected, e.g., mercury(IV) fluoride () but only under extraordinary conditions.
Compounds of mercury(I).
Different from its lighter neighbors, cadmium and zinc, mercury usually forms simple stable compounds with metal-metal bonds. Most mercury(I) compounds are diamagnetic and feature the dimeric cation, Hg. Stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate. Treatment of Hg(I) compounds complexation with strong ligands such as sulfide, cyanide, etc. induces disproportionation to and elemental mercury. Mercury(I) chloride, a colorless solid also known as calomel, is really the compound with the formula Hg2Cl2, with the connectivity Cl-Hg-Hg-Cl. It is a standard in electrochemistry. It reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride, which resists further oxidation. Mercury(I) hydride, a colorless gas, is the compound with the formula HgH.
Indicative of its tendency to bond to itself, mercury forms mercury polycations, which consist of linear chains of mercury centers, capped with a positive charge. One example is .
Compounds of mercury(II).
Mercury(II) is the most common oxidation state and is the main one in nature as well. All four mercuric halides are known. They form tetrahedral complexes with other ligands but the halides adopt linear coordination geometry, somewhat like Ag+ does. Best known is mercury(II) chloride, an easily sublimating white solid. HgCl2 forms coordination complexes that are typically tetrahedral, e.g. .
Mercury(II) oxide, the main oxide of mercury, arises when the metal is exposed to air for long periods at elevated temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400 °C, as was demonstrated by Priestly in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.
Being a soft metal, mercury forms very stable derivatives with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar and is the brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.
Mercury(II) salts form a variety of complex derivatives with ammonia. These include Millon's base (Hg2N+), the one-dimensional polymer (salts of )), and "fusible white precipitate" or [Hg(NH3)2]Cl2. Known as Nessler's reagent, potassium tetraiodomercurate(II) () is still occasionally used to test for ammonia owing to its tendency to form the deeply colored iodide salt of Millon's base.
Mercury fulminate is a detonator widely used in explosives.
Higher oxidation states.
Oxidation states above +2 in a non-charged species are extremely rare, although a cyclic mercurinium(IV) cation, with three substituents, may be an intermediate in oxymercuration reactions. In 2007, a report of synthesis of a mercury(IV) compound, mercury(IV) fluoride, was published. In the 1970s, there was a claim on synthesis of a mercury(III) compound, but it is now thought to be false.
Organomercury compounds.
Organic mercury compounds are historically important but are of little industrial value in the western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare examples of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organomercury compounds are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by a process known as biomethylation.
Applications.
Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy.
Medicine.
Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood. The first edition of the Merck's Manual featured many mercuric compounds such as:
The element mercury is an ingredient in dental amalgams. Thiomersal (called "Thimerosal" in the United States) is an organic compound used as a preservative in vaccines, though this use is in decline. Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link. Nevertheless thiomersal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 years of age and under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.
Another mercury compound merbromin (Mercurochrome) is a topical antiseptic used for minor cuts and scrapes is still in use in some countries.
Mercury in the form of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various traditional medicines, especially in traditional Chinese medicine. Review of its safety has found cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though this is typically reversible at therapeutic doses. Although this form of mercury appears less toxic than others, its use in traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been justified as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.
Today, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. Thermometers and sphygmomanometers containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. In the early 21st century, their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions. In 2002, the U.S. Senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of non-prescription mercury thermometers. In 2003, Washington and Maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices. Mercury compounds are found in some over-the-counter drugs, including topical antiseptics, stimulant laxatives, diaper-rash ointment, eye drops, and nasal sprays. The FDA has "inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness", of the mercury ingredients in these products. Mercury is still used in some diuretics, although substitutes now exist for most therapeutic uses.
Production of chlorine and caustic soda.
Chlorine is produced from sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis to separate the metallic sodium from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide. Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that were built in the United States used either membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.
Laboratory uses.
Some medical thermometers, especially those for high temperatures, are filled with mercury; however, they are gradually disappearing. In the United States, non-prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers has been banned since 2003.
Mercury is also found in liquid mirror telescopes.
Some transit telescopes use a basin of mercury to form a flat and absolutely horizontal mirror, useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference. Concave horizontal parabolic mirrors may be formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk, the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light. Such telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of 100, but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up.
Liquid mercury is a part of popular secondary reference electrode (called the calomel electrode) in electrochemistry as an alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode. The calomel electrode is used to work out the electrode potential of half cells. Last, but not least, the triple point of mercury, −38.8344 °C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale (ITS-90).
Niche uses.
Gaseous mercury is used in mercury-vapor lamps and some "neon sign" type advertising signs and fluorescent lamps. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; however simply reflecting some of the fluorescent-lamp ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice. Gaseous mercury is also found in some electron tubes, including ignitrons, thyratrons, and mercury arc rectifiers. It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection (see pictures). Gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon-filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity. An argon filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly. Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded/oven pumped only once. When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red/blue spots until the initial burning-in process is completed; eventually it will light a consistent dull off-blue color.
Cosmetics.
Mercury, as thiomersal, is widely used in the manufacture of mascara. In 2008, Minnesota became the first state in the United States to ban intentionally added mercury in cosmetics, giving it a tougher standard than the federal government.
A study in geometric mean urine mercury concentration identified a previously unrecognized source of exposure (skin care products) to inorganic mercury among New York City residents. Population-based biomonitoring also showed that mercury concentration levels are higher in consumers of seafood and fish meals.
Historic uses.
Many historic applications made use of the peculiar physical properties of mercury, especially as a dense liquid and a liquid metal:
Others applications made use of the chemical properties of mercury:
Historic medicinal uses.
Mercury(I) chloride (also known as calomel or mercurous chloride) has been used in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.
Toxicity and safety.
Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.
Mercury can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and mercury vapors can be inhaled, so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or of compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, is always carried out with adequate ventilation in order to avoid exposure to mercury vapor. The most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds, such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury. Inorganic compounds, such as cinnabar, are also highly toxic by ingestion or inhalation. Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning.
Releases in the environment.
Preindustrial deposition rates of mercury from the atmosphere may be about 4 ng /(1 L of ice deposit). Although that can be considered a natural level of exposure, regional or global sources have significant effects. Volcanic eruptions can increase the atmospheric source by 4–6 times.
Natural sources, such as volcanoes, are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions. The human-generated half can be divided into the following estimated percentages:
The above percentages are estimates of the global human-caused mercury emissions in 2000, excluding biomass burning, an important source in some regions.
Recent atmospheric mercury contamination in outdoor urban air was measured at 0.01–0.02 µg/m3. A 2001 study measured mercury levels in 12 indoor sites chosen to represent a cross-section of building types, locations and ages in the New York area. This study found mercury concentrations significantly elevated over outdoor concentrations, at a range of 0.0065 – 0.523 μg/m3. The average was 0.069 μg/m3.
Mercury also enters into the environment through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007. Most thermometers now use pigmented alcohol instead of mercury, and galinstan alloy thermometers are also an option. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field because they are more accurate than alcohol thermometers, though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.
Historically, one of the largest releases was from the Colex plant, a lithium-isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s. Records are incomplete and unclear, but government commissions have estimated that some two million pounds of mercury are unaccounted for.
A serious industrial disaster was the dumping of mercury compounds into Minamata Bay, Japan. It is estimated that over 3,000 people suffered various deformities, severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from what became known as Minamata disease.
Occupational exposure.
Due to the health effects of mercury exposure, industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries. The World Health Organization, OSHA, and NIOSH all treat mercury as an occupational hazard, and have established specific occupational exposure limits. Environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44 mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.
Treatment.
Research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a small fraction of the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than NAP.
Fish.
Fish and shellfish have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.
Regulations.
International.
140 countries agreed in the Minamata Convention on Mercury by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to prevent emissions.
United States.
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is charged with regulating and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.
The United States Clean Air Act, passed in 1990, put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on February 8, 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998.
The EPA announced new rules for coal-fired power plants on December 22, 2011. Cement kilns that burn hazardous waste are held to a looser standard than are standard hazardous waste incinerators in the United States, and as a result are a disproportionate source of mercury pollution.
European Union.
In the European Union, the directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits the amount of mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.
Norway.
Norway enacted a total ban on the use of mercury in the manufacturing and import/export of mercury products, effective January 1, 2008. In 2002, several lakes in Norway were found to have a poor state of mercury pollution, with an excess of 1 µg/g of mercury in their sediment.
In 2008, Norway’s Minister of Environment Development Erik Solheim said: “Mercury is among the most dangerous environmental toxins. Satisfactory alternatives to Hg in products are
available, and it is therefore fitting to induce a ban.” 
Sweden.
Products containing mercury were banned in Sweden in 2009.
Denmark.
In 2008, Denmark also banned dental mercury amalgam.

Operational history.
The Czechoslovak Air Force ordered 20 Š-4s in 1922 and these were delivered in early 1923. The plane lived out the 1920s as a fighter and trainer, but by 1927 difficulties were being experienced due to the low manufacturing quality of the Š-4. As a result, all remaining Š-4s were upgraded to Š-4a trainer aircraft in 1928.

Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 () (commonly referred to as HERA) designed primarily to address the subprime mortgage crisis. It authorized the Federal Housing Administration to guarantee up to $300 billion in new 30-year fixed rate mortgages for subprime borrowers if lenders write-down principal loan balances to 90 percent of current appraisal value. It was intended to restore confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by strengthening regulations and injecting capital into the two large U.S. suppliers of mortgage funding. States are authorized to refinance subprime loans using mortgage revenue bonds. Enactment of the Act led to the government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Legislative history.
The Act was passed by the United States Congress on July 24, 2008 and signed by President George W. Bush on July 30, 2008.
Subsequent amendments.
Some provisions of the law were modified by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009.
Federal Housing Finance Agency.
The Act also established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) out of the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO).
Through the powers granted to FHFA, created by the Act, on September 7, 2008, FHFA director James B. Lockhart III announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA. The action is "one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades".
Subtitles of the Act.
Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008.
Included a first-time home buyer refundable tax credit for purchases on or after April 9, 2008 and before July 1, 2009 equal to 10 percent of the purchase price of a principal residence, up to $7,500.
The Act provided emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes.
FHA Modernization Act of 2008.
An FHA loan is a federal assistance mortgage loan in the United States insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
The Act:
HOPE for Homeowners Act of 2008.
As of February 2009, only 451 applications had been received and 25 loans finalized, far short of the estimated 400,000 homeowners who were expected to participate. This was attributed to high fees, high interest rates, the need for a reduction in principal on the part of the lender, and the requirement that the federal government receive 50% of any appreciation in value of the house. Congress began hearings on the program in February.
Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008.
"Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act" (12 United States Code, Section 5100, "et seq."), passed by Congress and signed by President G.W. Bush in 2008, required all states to implement a Mortgage Loan Originator (hereafter: "MLO") licensing and registration system by August 1, 2009 (August 1, 2010 for legislatures that meet biennially). States can operate their own systems, subject to stringent federal standards, or they can participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (hereafter: "the Registry"), a service operated jointly by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators (CSBS/AARMR). If the state's licensing and registration program does not meet minimum standards at any time, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is empowered to step in and impose a compliant system upon the state.
The SAFE Act was intended to provide uniform licensing standards nationwide, as these licensing standards had been non-uniform from state to state for the past 20+ years. It was also designed to create a comprehensive licensing database so that all relevant information on MLOs will be centralized and publicly available. This should allow consumers to perform research, obtain unbiased professional information, and help them choose professionals with whom to deal. Especially, it will aid them in identifying and avoiding bad actors. Eventually, it is hoped, widespread consumer use of the Registry will drive dishonest and incompetent MLOs out of the mortgage loan origination business entirely.
Upon registration, MLOs are provided with a Unique Identifier number. All MLOs and their employers are required to provide this unique identifier to anyone who requests it, and the federally chartered mortgage institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, require that it be placed on all loan documents for loans that they purchase. Consumers will be able to use this number to obtain basic information on any registered MLO. This information includes name and aliases, employment history, current employment and contact information, negative civil judgments or settlements, and disciplinary and criminal history.
The Act and the implementing regulations, which were issued jointly by the federal banking agencies in 2010 (12 Code of Federal Regulations III,section 365.101, "et seq."), define a "mortgage loan originator" as any individual who "both" takes residential loan applications "and" "offers or negotiates" residential mortgage loan terms. Additionally, the individual must undertake these activities for economic gain ("i.e.", get paid for it). Persons who perform merely clerical or administrative tasks in connection with loan origination are not considered MLOs. The terms, "taking a mortgage loan application" and "offering or negotiating terms" are defined very broadly so that just about any person in the underwriting process who has more than cursory contact with a potential borrower is an MLO. Mortgage loans include financing and refinancing transactions, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of credit and just about any other credit transaction secured by a first or junior lien on a dwelling.
Not all persons who qualify as MLOs are required to become licensed or to register with the newly renamed Nationwide Mortgage and Licensing System and Registry ("the Registry"). Licensed Realtors and MLOs who work for federally regulated financial institutions, for example, are not required to be licensed as MLOs, although they are required to register. Those who would otherwise be required to register are exempted if they have (1) never been registered before and (2) perform five or fewer mortgage loan originations in any rolling twelve-month period. Registration must be renewed annually, and registrants must submit fingerprints for a criminal background check along with their first registration application.

Ecallantide

Ecallantide (trade name Kalbitor, investigational name DX-88) is a drug used for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) and in the prevention of blood loss in cardiothoracic surgery. It is an inhibitor of the protein kallikrein and a 60-amino acid polypeptide which was developed from a Kunitz domain through phage display to mimic antibodies inhibiting kallikrein. On November 27, 2009, ecallantide was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema for persons over 16 years of age.
If approved for cardiothoracic surgery, it could become a replacement for aprotinin, which was withdrawn in 2007 after being shown to cause complications.
Adverse effects.
The most common adverse effects are headache, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea. Less common, but observed in more than 5% of patients in clinical trials, are respiratory tract infections, fever, vomiting, itching and upper abdominal pain. Up to 4% of patients showed anaphylaxis, which lead to a black box warning in the US.
Interactions.
, no interaction studies have been conducted.
Mechanism of action.
HAE is caused by a mutation of the C1-inhibitor gene. Defective or missing C1-inhibitor permits activation of kallikrein, a protease that is responsible for liberating bradykinin from its precursor kininogen. An excess of bradykinin leads to fluid leakage from blood vessels, causing swelling of tissues typical of HAE.
Ecallantide suppresses this pathogenetic mechanism by selectively and reversibly inhibiting the activity of plasma kallikrein.

DRG Class 23

The German Class 23 ("Baureihe 23" or "BR 23") engines of the Deutsche Reichsbahn ("DRG") were standard ("Einheitslokomotiven") steam engines that were conceived as a replacement for the Prussian P 8 by the Schichau Works. They were given the same boiler as the Class 50s which were developed in parallel and, like them, the newly developed 2'2' T 26 tender with its front wall that protected train crews during reverse running. 
In 1941 the two prototypes were built and delivered. The procurement of 800 locomotives had been planned, however the constraints of the Second World War meant that they never entered full production. 
After the war the two locomotives, with operating numbers 23 001 and 23 002, went to the DR in East Germany and were variously stabled in Berlin, Brandenburg an der Havel, Jüterbog and Halle. In 1961, number 23 001 was given a "Reko" boiler with combustion chamber, developed for the Class 50. In 1970 the locomotive was given EDP number 35 2001-2. Number 23 002 was to be reconstructed, but was retired however in 1967 due to damage to the frame and scrapped.
Number 23 001 was scrapped in 1975 in Cottbus, as it could no longer serve any useful purpose.
After the war, the design of these Class 02 locomotives formed the basis for the new DB Class 23 and DR Class 23.10 locomotives which received the same class designation.

Avro 527

The Avro 527 was the last Avro two-seat fighter derivative of the basic 504 design. It was built early in 1916 for trial by the Royal Flying Corps, with the features of the RNAS Avro 504G but with a much more powerful engine; it did not reach production.
Design and development.
The RNAS Avro 504G was an 80 hp (60 kW) Gnome rotary-engined version of the Avro 504B with forward firing Vickers guns and a Scarff-ring mounted Lewis gun in the rear cockpit. The Avro 527 was a version of the 504G intended for the RFC with the much more powerful, 150 hp (112 hp) Sunbeam Nubian water-cooled engine. It used standard 504K wings and central skid, single axle undercarriage. Naval 504s had mostly been fitted with a vertical tail with a generous fixed fin, in contrast to RFC machines with the all moving, comma shaped rudder, and the 527 retained the fin from its 504G predecessor. The engine installation was very different from other 504s, though similar to that of the Avro 519 which used the same engine. There were two tall, almost vertical exhaust pipes, one from each bank of the upright V-eight Nubian, discharging just above the upper wing. Its radiator was mounted edge on (longitudinally) between the wings on the starboard side.
The 527 first flew sometime in 1916. A version with wings of 6 ft (1.83 m) span was considered, the 527A, but there is no record of it flying.
Operational history.
When trialled by the RFC, pilots found that it did not climb well and that their view was obscured by the large engine, its radiator and exhausts. As a result, production was discontinued and only one aircraft was ever built.

Sir John Hippisley, 1st Baronet

Sir John Coxe Hippisley, 1st Baronet (c. February 1746 – 3 May 1825), was a British diplomat and politician who pursued an 'unflagging, though wholly unsuccessful, quest for office' which led King George III of Great Britain to describe him as 'that busy man' and 'the grand intriguer'.
Early life and overseas appointments.
Born John Cox Hipsley in Bristol in 1746, he was the son of William Hipsley, a haberdasher, and Ann Webb. His middle name derived from his paternal grandmother, Dorothy Cox. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School and at Hertford College, Oxford, becoming a Doctor of Civil Law in 1776. He became a student at the Inner Temple in 1766 and was called to the bar in 1771. He was Treasurer of the Inner Temple from 19 November 1813 to 17 November 1814 and his monogram can be seen above the doorways of Nos. 10 and 11 King's Bench Walk.
In 1779 Hippisley travelled to Italy where he became the British government's man in Rome. He married his first wife Margaret Stuart in Rome in February 1780. Margaret was the second daughter of Sir John Stuart, third Baronet of Allanbank. They had four children together – Margaret Frances, born 1780; Windhamina Barbara (probably named after Hippisley's friend William Windham), born 1787; John Stuart, born 1790, and Louisa Anne.
In 1781 Hippisley secured an appointment with the East India Company and moved to Madras, eventually becoming paymaster in Tanjore. He resigned from the Company in 1787 and returned to England in 1789. In the following year he was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sudbury. At the general elections of 1796 and 1801 he was not returned to Parliament, but he was successful in 1802 and retained his seat until 1818 when he retired from the House of Commons.
In 1792 Hippisley returned to Italy and remained there until 1795, during which time he served as a semi-official representative of the British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger at the Court of Pope Pius VI. Upon returning to England he was called upon to negotiate the marriage between Prince Frederick of Württemberg (later Frederick I of Württemberg) to Charlotte, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of George III. After bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion, Hippisley finally received his long-sought baronetcy on 10 May 1796
In 1799 the plight of The Cardinal Duke of York, the last representative in the male line of the Royal House of Stuart, was brought to Hippisley's attention by Dr. Stefano Cardinal Borgia. Cardinal York was living in France, ill and penniless, and Hippisley persuaded George III to award him an annual pension of £4,000.
Second marriage and later years.
Hippisley's first wife Margaret died on 24 September 1799 in Brompton, London. In 1800 he served as High Sheriff of Berkshire, where he owned Warfield Grove, a red-brick Georgian mansion which he had bought from Admiral Sir George Bowyer. Hippisley sold the house to the Earl of Mountnorris in the early 19th century. In February 1801 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Anne Coxe (née Horner), the widow of Henry Hippisley Coxe of Ston Easton, Somerset. Despite the similarity of their names, John was not closely related to the Hippisleys of Ston Easton, if at all. He may have changed the spelling of his name around this time to further legitimise his position at Ston Easton.
Hippisley was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a vice-president and supporter of the Literary Fund Society, a benefactor of Downside Abbey, one of the principal promoters of the literary institutions of Bath and Bristol, a member of the government committee of the Turkey Company, vice-president of the West of England Agricultural Society and a member of the Society of Antiquarians. He was however not a popular man with all his contemporaries. The Rev. John Skinner referred to him as 'that great orator' and a 'great ass' in his diary, published as "The Journal of a Somerset Rector", while in 1810 the wit and politician Joseph Jekyll described how during a speech by Hippisley in parliament 'the house coughed him down five times in vain, and the catarrh lasted two hours'.
Hippisley had no children with Elizabeth. He retired from political life in 1818 and died on 3 May 1825 in Grosvenor Street, London. He was buried in the Inner Temple vault on 12 May 1825. His widow Elizabeth died on 25 March 1843 in Grosvenor Square, London, whereupon the Ston Easton estate was inherited by her grandnephew, John Hippisley. Sir John was succeeded as baronet by John Stuart Hippisley, his son by his first wife, but he died unmarried in Mells, Somerset on 20 March 1867, whereupon the baronetcy became extinct.

Pirate Party of Austria

The Pirate Party of Austria (, PIRAT) is a political party in Austria and part of the global Pirate Party movement which fights for freedom of information and the protection of privacy. 
It is mostly known for opposing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.
The party was founded by Florian Hufsky and Jürgen 'Juxi' Leitner during the run-up to the 2006 election in Austria, but failed to gather the necessary signatures to contest the election.
On 14 March 2010, the PPÖ ran for municipal elections for its first time in the city of Bregenz and received 1.62% votes, but not enough for a seat.
Christopher Clay, Marlies Wawra, Rodrigo Jorquera, Lukas Daniel Klausner and André Igler have been elected on 28 October 2012 to board members in the General Assembly of the Pirate Party Austria. Albert Gugerell has been elected as treasurer.
In January Alexander Ofer, former member of the Tyrolean State Pirate Party, was expelled together with all state party members.
After Ofers entering of the city council the Pirate Party announced to come up to the "Pirate Party Tyrol" (Ofers new party he had founded before getting expelled. They successfully ran for a post in the city of Innsbruck).
But Ofer said "Wir wollen mit der Piratenpartei Österreichs nichts zu tun haben, das sind Pfuscher." "("We don't want to have anything to do with the Pirate Party of Austria , they are botchers"").
In 2012 the social-liberal daily newspaper "Der Standard" stated that the Pirates could be a competitor against The Greens and the Freedom Party, and could become also the new Liberal Forum, with
the Pirate Party Austria is heading for National Assembly in 2013 and EU Elections in 2014.
In municipal elections in Graz on 25 November 2012, the Pirates gained 2.68% of the vote and one seat.

Blonanserin

Blonanserin (Lonasen) is a relatively new atypical antipsychotic (approved by PMDA in January 2008) commercialized by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma in Japan and Korea for the treatment of schizophrenia. Relative to many other antipsychotics, blonanserin has an improved tolerability profile, lacking side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, excessive sedation, or hypotension. As with many second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics it is significantly more efficacious in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to first-generation (typical) antipsychotics such as haloperidol.
Blonanserin acts as a mixed 5-HT2A (Ki = 0.812 nM) and D2 receptor (Ki = 0.142 nM) antagonist and also exerts some blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 26.7 nM). It lacks significant affinity for numerous other sites including the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3, D1, α2-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, H1, and mACh receptors and the monoamine transporters, though it does possess low affinity for the sigma receptor (IC50 = 286 nM).
It has a relatively high affinity towards the 5-HT6 receptor perhaps underpinning its recently unveiled efficacy in treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.

Yves Manglou

Yves Manglou (born 20 August 1943, Bras-Panon, Réunion) is a Réunionese writer who writes in both French and Réunion Creole.
Biography.
Yves Manglou grew up on the French island of Réunion at a time when traditional storytelling was still very popular. Réunion was still a French colony and the abolition of slavery had occurred less than a century before.
Brought up as one of nine children under the watchful eye of his school teacher father and stay-at-home mother, Manglou enjoyed much freedom exploring the banks of the Saint-Jean river, often going barefoot and shirtless.
From the end of 1960 to 1975, Manglou successively held the position of Director of Social & Cultural Institutions in Sainte-Suzanne, Soisy-sous-Montmorency and Boulogne-Billancourt.
In 1971 he devoted a year of advanced study at the French National Institute of Popular Education at Marly-le-Roi to the study of the development of inter-disciplinary scholarship in rural areas. Manglou's study culminated "Animation and Development," a dissertation that was written in collaboration with Jean Schüler and is considered authoritative in the field.
In 1974-1975, as Director of the Youth Center of Boulogne-Billancourt, Manglou began to coordinate various volunteer organizations in a city of 120,000. The exhibition "Associations in the City", unique for its time, received 10,000 visitors.
During this same period Manglou also obtained a "maîtrise" in Human Sciences at the University of Paris, Val-de-Marne - a foreshadowing of experienced-based learning, which was later formalized in France as Validation des Acquis de l'Experience.
These various sociological approaches and a thirst for getting to know people and their cultures naturally led Yves Manglou to make his native island the focus of his literary journey.
Manglou is currently Series Editor at Éditions Orphie.

Clianthus maximus

Clianthus maximus, commonly known as Kaka beak ("Kōwhai Ngutu-kākā" in Māori), is a woody legume shrub native to New Zealand's North Island. It is one of two species of "Clianthus" (Kaka beak) and both have striking clusters of red flowers which resemble the beak of the Kākā, a New Zealand parrot.
The species is endangered in the wild, with only 153 trees found in a 2005 survey (down from over 1000 in 1996), in the East Coast and northern Hawkes Bay regions.
William Colenso described "C. maximus" in 1885, identifying it as distinct from "C. puniceus", the other Kaka beak. However Thomas Kirk reduced "C. maximus" to a variety of "C. puniceus" ("C. puniceus" var. "maximus") in 1899. Peter Heenan reinstated "C. maximus" as a separate species in 2000.
Prior to the 1990s, "C. maximus" was rarely cultivated, most stock available for cultivation being "C. puniceus" (then "C. puniceus" var. "puniceus"). "C. maximus" is now widespread, however, and has generally replaced "C. puniceus" in cultivation.

Häfeli DH-4

__NOTOC__
The Häfeli DH-4 was a Swiss fighter prototype in the late 1910s, build by the Eidgenoessische Konstruktionswerkstaette. The DH-4 was a single seat fighter based on the successful Häfeli DH-3 design. It was made of wood with fabric covering, and carried one machine gun.
Operational history.
The Swiss Air Force trialled it from May 1918 to August 1918, but the DH-4 was found to possess disappointing performance and poor handling. As such only one was ever produced and production ceased in late 1918.

Zagrebačka Avenue

Zagrebačka Avenue is an important east-west avenue in western Zagreb, Croatia. It is a dual carriageway with three lanes in each direction that starts as a continuation of the Slavonska Avenue under the intersection with the Savska Road, ending at the Savska Opatovina roundabout.
It was previously part of Ljubljanska Avenue, which used to span from the Jankomir interchange to Savska Road in the outer city center, but in 2006 a part of Ljubljanska Avenue was widened and separated from the old avenue to be named to Zagrebačka Avenue at the proposal of Mayor Milan Bandić. After the widening the Savska Opatovina rotary (technically a roundabout interchange) was added, but none of other intersections were converted to interchanges, though, and Bandić was publicly criticized because of that problem., as well as for making, by some accounts, an unnecessary and confusing name change for the street.

Cape Serdtse-Kamen (, literally translated as "Cape Heart-Stone") is a headland on the northeastern coast of Chukotka, Russian Federation. It is about 140 km west of Cape Dezhnev, 120 km east of Kolyuchinskaya Bay and about 30 km to the east of the Neskynpil'gyn Lagoon. Nearby is the village of Enurmino.
Cape Serdtse-Kamen is a geographic landmark, east of which the Chukchi Sea coast slants sharply to the south-east until the Bering Strait. 
The wreck of the Soviet steamer Chelyuskin, which sank in 1934 during its pioneer exploration of the Northern Sea Route, was discovered in 2006 on the seabed at the depth of about 50 m not far from the cape. The village of Uelen, the easternmost settlement in Russia, is located 150 km to the southeast of Cape Serdtse-Kamen along the coastline. 
Ecology.
The area around this landhead is a natural habitat for the Short-tailed Albatross "(Phoebastria albatrus)".
Bowhead whales are frequently sighted in the waters off the Serdtse-Kamen Cape. Very large numbers of walruses have been observed resting on shore and in the shallow waters adjacent to this cape during the late autumn.

<doc id="18617569" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18617569" title="Philips Park, Prestwich">
Philips Park, Prestwich

Philips Park is an area of parkland situated within the Metropolitan Borough of Bury on the boundary of Whitefield and Prestwich, in Greater Manchester. The park consists of rich woodland and grassland habitat and is home to an assortment of wildlife. Two thirds of the site was once the Philips family estate, and the remainder, known as Waterdale, is Irwell Valley land reclaimed following the demolition of two bleach and dye works. The park is a Local Nature Reserve.
The park is also home to The Barn Countryside Centre. The visitor centre hosts many events for all ages, including willow weaving and pottery workshops, pond dipping and woodland management training courses.
History.
The park owes its name to the Philips family, who owned the land between 1799 and 1948. The land, which was originally part of the medieval Pilkington Park deer park was purchased by Robert Philips of the textile firm J & N. Philips, in 1798. Robert and his wife Ann had two sons (the politicians Mark Philips and Robert Philips), and nine daughters. Responsible for the construction of the buildings, the Philips family also retained some natural and man-made features when landscaping the area. These included the ancient woodlands of North Wood, Mid Wood, Mere Clough, and a Medieval Deer pale marking the southern and eastern boundaries.
The Liberal Party politician Mark Philips was born in the park on 4 November 1800.
The family lived in Philips Park until the grand-daughter of Robert Philips, Anna Maria Philips, died in 1946. The park was sold to Whitefield Council (to be shared with Prestwich Council) and opened as a public park in 1948. The contents of The Park were auctioned, with items such as a Georgian Mahogany dining room sideboard by Robert Gillow being sold for £6.
In 1971 the construction of the M62 motorway reached the area, removing much of the valley of the North Wood during construction.
Buildings.
The Park.
Completed by Robert Philips in 1830, "The Park" was the family's main residence. Built in the Italian villa style and furnished by Robert Gillow, the house was situated close to a steep bank which sheltered it from the north. The front was well proportioned and the back faced onto a lawn. The house fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1950. The area where it stood is now occupied by a car park.
Access to The Park was originally from Park Lane. In 1852 a viaduct was built enabling carriages to be driven directly from Bury New Road, along Philips Park Road, to The Park. The viaduct became unsafe and was closed off for many years before being demolished by the Royal Engineers in a controlled explosion in the 1960s.
Outwood Lodge.
The former home of John Grundy (chairman of the East Lancashire Railway) and later Mark Philips, it overlooked the North Wood and was designed by Johnson of Lichfield. It was replaced by the present North Lodge from around 1890–1900. All that remains is part of a wall outside the North Lodge.
North Lodge.
Located at the junction of Philips Park Road and Park Lane, this building replaced Outwood Lodge. Parts of Outwood Lodge were used in its construction. This building was used as staff accommodation until the death of Anna Maria Philips in 1946.
Located at 53.537759,-2.304474
Philips Park Road Viaduct.
This viaduct was built in 1852 at a cost of £8,000. Eight brick arches spanned the valley some below. The cost of construction was shared between Robert Philips, the Earl of Derby, and the East Lancashire Railway. The viaduct provided a direct route for coaches between Bury New Road, The Park, and Molyneux Brow railway station. The pathway underneath the viaduct to Mere Clough was the subject of a legal case, when the Earl of Derby's agent, Tom Statter, blocked the pathway to prevent acts of trespass. The case was dismissed and costs awarded against the Earl.
Located at 53.537343,-2.29772
The viaduct was showing severe signs of dilapidation by 1965, and was subsequently demolished in November of the same year. The M60 motorway has replaced the path of the viaduct and other than the height of the motorway at that point (relative to the valley floor), no trace of its existence remains.
Philips Park Lodge.
Philips Park Lodge, known locally as "The Witch's Cottage" was a small thatched cottage dating from and built in the style of the regency period. Latterly, it existed in a neglected condition for some time and had been subject to arson attacks by vandals. It was demolished in 1969 to make way for the M62 motorway.
South Lodge.
The South Lodge, built in the same period as Philips Park Lodge, overlooked a small reservoir east of Molyneux Brow railway station, along an ancient packhorse route. As late as the 1960s, the property had no gas or electricity. Despite attaining listed building status, it fell into disuse and disrepair, and was demolished in 1974.
Located at 53.531862,-2.312837
Thatched Cottage.
The Thatched Cottage was the original entrance lodge to Philips Park. Built alongside a tree-lined driveway, the cottage was replaced in the early 1900s by the North Lodge, although not on the same site. This cottage was demolished to make way for the M62 in 1968.
Located at 53.536896,-2.304103
The Stables.
Recently a nightclub, now being restored to pre-20th century state. This has involved the demolition of all the sections that were added to make a nightclub venue, revealing the original courtyard that had become hidden. The project has been supported by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Features.
The Conservatory.
The conservatory was built in ashlar sandstone soon after 1800. Its facade has large rectangular windows with glazing bars and a central pediment. Its glazed roof has a circular lantern light. It is a grade II listed building. Its centerpiece was a bronze fountain with a stone basin from Florence, set in a moss lined alcove. A lily pond is below the conservatory.
Grass Walk.
The Grass Walk was a grass staircase leading to a Garden Temple originally housing a marble statue carved in Rome in 1856.
Current status.
Some of the original buildings remain, such as the Grade II listed North Lodge and Grade II listed Conservatory, the Park Hall, and some of the staff accommodation and stables area. The original house occupied by the Philips family was demolished in 1950. In 1998 a restoration plan for the park was commissioned by Bury Council, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. A year later Philips Park was de-listed from the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England due to deterioration. The park is currently subject to a £4m five year plan to regenerate the area.
In 2009 the Friends of Prestwich Forest Park successfully applied for a grant which, along with funding from Bury Metropolitan Borough Council, was used to clear Cobster Field. The field was a large expanse of grazing ground, the purpose of which was to impress visitors as their carriages came down the drive to the Philips' mansion but when the M62 motorway was built the field had been covered with subsoil and was reverting to woodland. The money was used to clear the field, reseed with grass, and reinstate the views down the Irwell Valley to Manchester City Centre.
Access.
Vehicular access to the park is by Park Lane, northwest of Junction 17 of the M60 motorway. The North Lodge of the park is located on the junction of Park lane and Philips Park Road. The lane crosses the motorway over a bridge. Access is also possible by foot or cycle by the multitude of old roads and trails around the park perimeter.

Mark Hamill

Mark Richard Hamill (born September 25, 1951) is an American actor, voice actor, producer, director, and writer. He is best known for his starring role as Luke Skywalker in the original "Star Wars" trilogy, and 
his voice role as the Joker in ' and its spin-offs. He also voiced the Joker in the acclaimed video games ' and "". Hamill has also lent his voice to various other villains and anti-heroes in various other animated productions.
Early life and education.
Hamill was born in Oakland, California, and raised in Virginia. He is the son of Virginia Suzanne (née Johnson) and William Thomas Hamill, who was a captain in the U.S. Navy. He is one of seven children, including two brothers, Will and Patrick, and four sisters, Terry, Jan, Jeanie, and Kim. His mother was of half Swedish descent. When Mark was a child, his father's career meant moving on numerous occasions and subsequently, he attended different schools throughout his early life. In his elementary years, he went to Walsingham Academy and Poe Middle School. At age eleven, he moved to the 5900 block of Castleton Drive in San Diego where he attended Hale Junior High School and then, during his freshman year at James Madison Senior High School, his family moved to Virginia. By junior year, his father was stationed in Japan where Mark attended Nile C. Kinnick High School in Yokohama, and was a member of the drama club. After that he attended Annandale High School in Annandale, Virginia. He subsequently enrolled at Los Angeles City College and majored in drama.
Early career.
Hamill's early career included voicing the character Corey Anders on the Saturday morning cartoon "Jeannie" by Hanna-Barbera Productions. He also portrayed the oldest son, David, on the pilot episode of "Eight Is Enough", though the role was later performed by Grant Goodeve. He acted in TV series such as "The Texas Wheelers", "General Hospital", "The Partridge Family", and "One Day at a Time". One of his earliest films was the made-for-TV film "The City".
"Star Wars".
Robert Englund was auditioning for a part in "Apocalypse Now" when he walked across the hall where auditions were taking place for George Lucas's "Star Wars". After watching the auditions for a while, he realized that his friend, aspiring actor Mark Hamill, would be perfect for the role of Luke Skywalker. He suggested to Hamill that he audition for the part; Hamill did, and won the role.
Released in the summer of 1977, "Star Wars" was an enormous, unexpected success and made a huge impact on the film industry. Hamill also appeared in the "Star Wars Holiday Special" (1978) and later starred in the successful "Star Wars" sequels "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) and "Return of the Jedi" (1983). For each of the sequels, Hamill was honored with the Saturn Award for Best Actor given by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, & Horror Films. 
He reprised the role of Luke Skywalker for the radio dramatizations of both "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back", but did not act in the "Return of the Jedi" radio drama due to budgetary concerns. With the acquisition of Lucasfilm by the Walt Disney Company, it has been announced that there will be more Star Wars films starting with Episode VII, which will be released in 2015. It is rumored that Hamill will appear in the new trilogy alongside fellow Star Wars actors Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher as Han Solo and Princess Leia, respectively.
Reprints of Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" (which influenced Lucas as he was developing the films) issued after the release of "Star Wars" in 1977 used the image of Hamill as Luke Skywalker on the cover.
Car accident.
On January 11, 1977, one day before he was set to shoot one of the needed scenes in "Star Wars", Hamill was in a car accident in which he fractured his nose and left cheekbone, requiring seven hours of surgery. As a result, a double was used for the landspeeder pickup shots.
Live action and stage work.
After the success of "Star Wars", Hamill found that audiences identified him very closely with the role of Luke Skywalker. He attempted to avoid typecasting by appearing in "Corvette Summer" (1978) and the better-known World War II film "The Big Red One" (1980). Hamill also made a guest appearance on "The Muppet Show" as both himself and his role of Luke Skywalker. C-3PO and R2-D2 were along with him on a search for Chewbacca in that episode. As the 1980s wore on, Hamill did little film work outside of "Star Wars". Instead, he acted on Broadway, starring in "The Elephant Man", "Harrigan 'N Hart" (for which he received a Drama Desk Award nomination), "The Nerd", and other stage plays, for which he received positive reviews.
Hamill played the antagonist Hawkins in the Swedish action movie "Hamilton" in 1998. Some of his other film credits include "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia", "Britannia Hospital", "Slipstream", "The Guyver", and the 1995 remake of "Village of the Damned". In 1990, he played an escaped mental patient who terrorizes Michael Dudikoff and his wife in "Midnight Ride". He also narrated "The Sci-Fi Files", a four-part documentary about the influence of science fiction upon present society. In 2001, Hamill starred in the feature film "Thank You, Good Night" alongside Christian Campbell, John Paul Pitoc, and Sally Kirkland. Hamill appeared in the film "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" and parodies Luke Skywalker, The Joker, The Trickster (of "The Flash" fame), and the rest of the vast array of super-villain voices he has done and himself all at the same time.
In live-action television, Hamill had recurring roles in "General Hospital" and "The Texas Wheelers," and a small role in "The Bill Cosby Show." He guest appeared in two episodes as the Trickster in the live-action television series of "The Flash", a role he would later reprise in the animated series "Justice League Unlimited". He has made cameo appearances on "MADtv" (where he played the estranged father of Ms. Swan), and appeared on "Saturday Night Live" (playing himself being sold on a "Star Wars"-themed home shopping sale). Hamill appeared on single episodes of "3rd Rock from the Sun" and "Just Shoot Me!" In 1986, he appeared in an episode of the TV series "Amazing Stories" ("Gather Ye Acorns") in the role of Jonathan. He also had a recurring role as Tobias LeConte on "seaQuest DSV." It has been recounted by Richard Hatch that, shortly after the filming of "Star Wars", when Mark appeared on set for a guest appearance on "Streets of San Francisco", he was asked by Richard about recent work, to which Mark had reportedly replied "I just finished a movie called "Star Wars"."
Hamill also directed and starred in the 2005 direct-to-DVD "". A comic book fan who attended science fiction and comic conventions before he became famous, Hamill claimed that his character was based on an exaggerated version of himself. He and his crew shot most of the "mockumentary" film during the 2002 San Diego Comic-Con, and enlisted Stan Lee, Kevin Smith, and Hugh Hefner in small roles. The movie won an award for Best Live-Action DVD Premiere Movie at the 2005 DVD Exclusive Awards.
Voice acting.
Mark Hamill has gained a reputation as a prolific voice actor. He previously did voice acting work in the Ralph Bakshi film "Wizards", where he played "Sean, leader of the Knights of Stardust," which was released just three months before "Star Wars" in 1977. Though the voice-role he is most known for is Batman's archenemy the Joker, his success as the Joker has led him to portray a wide variety of characters (mostly villainous) in television, film, anime, and video games. Mark Hamill was also the voice of The Hobgoblin in the 1990s "Spider-Man" cartoon series.
The Joker.
Hamill's acclaimed role as the Joker began in "" (1992–1995), and continued to many later spin-off series, video games and films. Hamill had initially played a guest voice role as corrupt businessman Ferris Boyle in the episode "", and was delighted when offered the role of the Joker, one of his favorite characters, after the previous choice Tim Curry dropped out. The most prominent feature of his portrayal that has garnered such acclaim is his dynamic use of laughter to express the Joker's mood. Hamill referred to the Joker's laugh as being like a musical instrument and would practice laughing maniacally while driving to recording sessions. Hamill received critical acclaim for his performance, which put him in high demand as a voice-over actor of cartoon villains.
Hamill also voiced the Joker in three episodes of ', five episodes of "The New Batman Adventures", five episodes of "Justice League", an episode of "Static Shock" and a few segments in "Robot Chicken". He also voiced the Joker in the theatrical film ' (1993) and the direct-to-video film "" (2000).
The short-lived WB live action series, "Birds of Prey", based on the comic book of the same title, featured a flashback sequence in which the Joker shoots Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) and paralyzes her. This sequence featured Hamill voicing the Joker, dubbed over actor Roger Stoneburner whose facial structure more resembled the character. The actor's face was shot in the background so as to be slightly blurred. Hamill also voiced the Joker alongside his "Batman: The Animated Series" co-star Kevin Conroy as Batman and Jason Hillhouse as Dick Grayson in a feature of a storyboard scene included in the 2005 Special Edition DVD of Tim Burton's 1989 film "Batman". This scene depicted the origin of Robin, which was not filmed because the producers felt it was out of place with the rest of the film.
Hamill has said that he has voiced the Joker for toys and amusement park rides. Although these jobs did not pay particularly well, he enjoyed even these small roles and admitted being protective of the character, expressing concern with others "sleeping in his sleeping bag". He also self-identifies as a "real comic book nerd".
Hamill has portrayed the Joker in a few Batman-themed video games, notably "Batman Vengeance", the Sega CD version of "The Adventures of Batman & Robin", and in '. Hamill again reprised his role of The Joker in the "Asylums sequel, "", as well as the computer and PlayStation 3 MMORPG "DC Universe Online". In May 2010, Hamill declared to IGN UK that his role in "Arkham City" would be his last as the Joker. On October 19, 2011, shortly after the release of the game, he confirmed this on his Twitter account, saying "Hello/Goodbye Joker! I've enjoyed every minute behind the wheel of the Clown Prince’s crazy car — I'm going to miss him more than I can say!!".

Jennifer Page

Jennifer Anne "Jennie" Page, CBE (born 12 November 1944) was Chief Executive of the London Millennium Dome project from 1 March 1995 until she was fired after a flawed opening night and poor early attendance at the start of 2000.
Education.
Page attended Barr's Hill Grammar School for Girls. She was later educated at Royal Holloway, University of London where, as an undergraduate she had been awarded the George Smith Studentship and where she obtained a First-Class Honours BA degree in English in 1966 followed by a Driver postgraduate scholarship.
Early career.
Prior to her appointment to the Dome project, she was Chief Executive of English Heritage from 1989 to 1995, having been recruited by the then chairman, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu (chairman 1984–1992). She later worked for chairman Jocelyn Stevens. On her appointment to the Millennium Commission, Stephen Dorrell said:
"The work of the Commission will leave a permanent mark of the face of the country and the job of the Chief Executive will be crucial to the Commission's success. Jennie Page is the right person for the job and we are delighted that she is going to join us." Jocelyn Stevens said:"I have been privileged to work very closely with Jennie since I have been Chairman of English Heritage. She has been my chief collaborator and strong support through a challenging period. I will miss her and her intuitive wisdom very much indeed and I wish her the same success in her new job that she has achieved at English Heritage. The Millennium Commission is singularly fortunate in obtaining Jennie's extraordinary combination of knowledge and management skills."
Before the appointments at English Heritage and the Dome project she was a civil servant in the Departments of the Environment and Transport, Britoil (formerly BNOC), London Docklands Development Corporation, and Pallas Group. She was also a non-executive director of Railtrack Group plc, a part-time appointment earning her £26,000 per year. Railtrack Group was placed into members' voluntary liquidation as RT Group on 18 October 2002.
She was also a non-executive director of The Equitable Life Assurance Society which almost collapsed financially in the millennium year. The Society issued claims for negligence against nine former directors, including Page, but in 2005 conceded total defeat in a four-year £3.2bn legal action to obtain compensation for policyholders. £10.2m was paid to the former directors to cover much of their legal expenses with Page paid just over £3m.
Position as Dome chief executive.
Page was headhunted for the job by the then Heritage Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, according to "The Observer". Page had previously worked for the London Docklands Development Corporation and had a reputation for a hardheaded style of management. Cracks developing behind the scenes began to show in January 1998 when Stephen Bayley, creative director of the project, resigned. He described Government Minister Peter Mandelson, whose project it had become, as a dictator reminiscent of: "an East German Stalinist".
Page was sacked as Chief Executive on 5 February 2000. She had come under pressure after an opening night fiasco on 31 December 1999, followed by poor attendance in January 2000 and a revolt by sponsors. She was replaced by an unknown 34-year-old Frenchman, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, known as "P-Y" and also nicknamed "the Gerbil" by the popular press, who had previously worked for the Disneyland Paris theme park. He was not thought particularly senior in the Disney organisation.
During her time at the Dome, and with compensation for her early departure, she was rumored to have received a salary of £500,000. Later, in June 2000, Page gave evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport. She stated that ""he Dome had been seen by ministers and the public as a political project almost since its inception"". Page claimed that she had asked ministers to step back from the project to calm the controversy surrounding it. In what was seen as a reference to the close interest in the Dome from Peter Mandelson, the former so-called "Minister for the Dome", and his successor Lord Falconer of Thoroton, Page told the committee: ""I made several attempts to persuade ministers that standing back from the Dome would be good for them as well as good for the Dome"". Page added to her criticism of ministers by insisting that the unexpected decision by the Prime Minister Tony Blair to invite one million schoolchildren to the Dome for free had had a significant impact on its income. It meant many parents would no longer pay to visit with their families, and forced the building of extra facilities for the large school parties. A decision to ban visitors arriving by car also cut the public's level of interest.
Post-Dome career.
In 2001 Page married Jeremy David Orme, an accountant. In 2006, she was appointed vice-chairman of the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England, a statutory body, chaired by Frank Field MP, whose purpose is to: ""romote the care and conservation of the Cathedral churches of the Church of England"".

Gennadi Zakharov

Gennadi Zakharov was a Soviet physicist who worked for the United Nations.
In 1986, a Guyanese student, known to the world only as “C.S.”, met him at a subway station in the Queens borough of New York. C.S. had known Zakharov for about three years. He had been helped by Zakharov in his studies and in securing a job with a defense subcontractor.
During their encounter in the subway station, C.S. handed over an envelope that contained classified documents describing United States Air Force jet engines in exchange for $1,000 in cash. Immediately after the exchange, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation swarmed around Zakharov, subduing him and shackling him in handcuffs. It was only then that Zakharov discovered that C.S. was working undercover with the FBI and that his plan to steal secret technical information from the United States had failed.
The KGB retaliated to this incident by arresting Nicholas Daniloff, an American journalist, three days later in Moscow charging him with espionage. After a hectic discussion between the two governments, the two men were exchanged without pressing any charges.
