Council for the Affairs of the Province of Quebec

The Council for the Affairs of the Province of Quebec, more commonly called the Legislative Council of Quebec (but not to be confused with the later institution with that same name), was an advisory body constituted by section XII of the "Quebec Act" of 1774. Together with the representative of the Crown (the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor or the temporary Administrator of the province), it acted, between 1774 and 1791, as the legislature of the old Province of Quebec.
Powers.
The Council had the "Power and Authority to make Ordinances for the Peace, Welfare, and good Government, of the said Province, with the Consent of his Majesty's Governor, or, in his Absence, of the Lieutenant-governor, or Commander in Chief for the Time being.", excepting the power to "lay any Taxes or Duties within the said Province, such Rates and Taxes only excepted as the Inhabitants of any Town or District within the said Province may be authorized by the said Council to assess, levy, and apply, within the said Town or District. for the Purpose of making Roads, erecting and repairing publick Buildings, or for any other Purpose respecting the local Convenience and economy of such Town or District."
Eligibility.
Section VII of the "Quebec Act" opened the door of all provincial offices to Roman Catholic subjects. The section exempted Catholics from taking the Test Oath (the abjuration of the Catholic faith) and made them take an alternative oath of allegiance to the British Crown:
Because of this special oath they were required to vow, Canadian Catholics, who formed the immense majority of the population in the province, were permitted to take a more direct part to the legislation of their native country. In practise however, Catholic Legislative Councillors remained a minority in the Council from its creation in 1774 to its abolition in 1791.
Composition.
Councillors numbered between at least seventeen and no more than twenty-three. In 1775, Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth instructed Governor General Guy Carleton to call in these individuals to fill in the Council:
Some of these members had been sitting on the first Council of Quebec constituted by Governor General James Murray in 1764 to advise on all matters of State. About 12 years later, in May 1787, the Council's composition was:
With the adoption of the "Constitutional Act" of 1791, the sections of the "Quebec Act" dealing with the Council, its composition and powers, were repealed. However, most of the members then sitting on the Council were called into the new Legislative Council of Lower Canada created by the said act.

Russula betularum

Russula betularum is a small, very pale member of the "Russula" (brittlegills) genus of mushrooms. It is usually white to very pale pink, inedible, and grows with birch trees. It is commonly known as the birch brittlegill.
Taxonomy.
The specific epithet "betularum" "of the birches", refers to its association with birch ("Betula" species). Some sources regard it as a variety of the sickener ("R. emetica").
Description.
The cap is convex to flattened, and often has a central depression. On expansion the margin becomes furrowed, and bears low warts. It is 2–5 cm (0.8–2 in) in diameter, and the cuticle may be peeled off completely. The cap ranges in colour from white to pale pink, to deep pink, and can even be pale buff. Although more often it is white with a pale pink blush, turning pale yellow ochre in the centre. The stem is typically longer than the diameter of the cap, and is cylindrical or slightly club-shaped. It is white, and very fragile. The gills are also white, and well spaced, and the spore print is white. The flesh is white and tastes hot. It might be confused with "Russula fragilis" (Pers.) Fr. which can be pale in colour, and occur in the same habitat. However, the cuticle of the latter species is only three quarters peeling, usually darker at the centre, and with purplish tones. It also has marked serrations on the gill edges.
Distribution and habitat.
Russula betularum appears in summer and early autumn. It is widespread in Britain, Europe, and Scandinavia, and is probably mycorrhizal with birch trees. It often grows in damp places in woodlands.
Edibility.
This mushroom is inedible, and has a hot 'peppery' taste. Many bitter tasting red-capped species can cause problems if eaten raw; the symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: diarrhoea, vomiting and colicky abdominal cramps. The active agent has not been identified but thought to be sesquiterpenes, which have been isolated from the related genus "Lactarius" and from "Russula sardonia".

USS Winterberry (AN-56)

USS "Winterberry" (AN-56/YN-75) was an which served with the United States Navy in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations during World War II. Despite being attacked near Okinawa by enemy suicide planes, she managed to return safely home after the war with the ship bearing one battle star.
Launched in California.
"Winterberry" (AN-56) -- originally projected as "Tupelo" (YN-75) -- was laid down on 17 September 1943 at Stockton, California, by the Stockton-Pollock Shipbuilding Company; reclassified an auxiliary net-laying ship and redesignated "AN-56" on 20 January 1944; launched on 22 March 1944; and commissioned on 30 May 1944, Lt. Sheldon E. Aarens in command.
World War II service.
Pacific theatre operations.
Following preliminary operations along the California coast, "Winterberry" departed San Pedro, California, on 30 July and headed west. The net-laying ship arrived in Pearl Harbor on 10 August and remained there for almost a month. She stood out of Pearl Harbor on 5 September to resume her voyage westward. "Winterberry" stopped briefly at Johnston Island on 9 September and reached Majuro Atoll on the 15th.
Records regarding "Winterberry's" service between mid-September 1944 and the time of the Okinawa invasion in April 1945 are fragmentary and imprecise. She appears to have served at Majuro, Guam, Ulithi, and in the Palau Islands. In November, she was definitely at Kossol Roads in the Palau group because she reported sighting a submarine at 0858 on the 19th while she was laying torpedo nets at the west entrance to the roadstead. She indicated that the submarine submerged and surfaced three times in the space of two minutes and then moved off before auxiliary motor minesweeper USS "YMS-33" belatedly got underway to investigate. That submarine probably was "RO-37", which and sank later that day about 20 miles north of the west entrance.
Supporting the Okinawa invasion.
While it is conceivable that she was in the neighborhood of the Ryukyu Islands for the preliminary occupation of the roadstead at Kerama Retto, no hard evidence supports the conclusion. In any event, she was off Okinawa on 1 April 1945, D-day for the invasion of that bitterly contested island. By the 7th, she had moved to Ulithi. "Winterberry" was back at Okinawa by 28 May. At 0730 that day, an enemy plane attacked the ships assembled in Buckner Bay. "Winterberry" opened fire, but the enemy succeeded in crashing into one of the attack transports. 
Attacked by aircraft.
Fifteen minutes later, three more dive bombers raided the anchorage. They dove in from the sun and immediately drew antiaircraft fire. "Winterberry" opened up with her guns and assisted in bringing down two of the three raiders. At the height of that melee, a Japanese "Val" swooped on the anchorage. "Winterberry" could not fire on this enemy because friendly ships were in her line of fire, but the other ships brought him down.
During the early afternoon of 3 June, she again assisted in downing a kamikaze. At 1912 on the 11th, she joined the antiaircraft barrage when a single "Val" swooped down out of a heavy cloud cover. Oblivious to the curtain of gunfire, he dove at dock landing ship . He overshot the dock landing ship, climbed, did a wingover and entered his second suicide dive. This time, he chose a victory ship; but the antiaircraft fire, which he had ignored so contemptuously, cut his mission short. "Winterberry's" guns combined with those of the other ships in the area to splash the kamikaze but a scant few yards short of his intended victim.
End-of-war operations.
During the waning months of World War II, "Winterberry" continued to serve at Okinawa. On 5 August, she departed the Ryukyus, bound for Saipan where she arrived on the 11th. The cessation of hostilities on 15 August found her still at Saipan. However, on the 20th, she got underway for Iwo Jima. The net-layer reached her destination three days later and operated in the Volcano Islands -- at Iwo Jima and at Chichi Jima -- until late in October. On 24 October, she departed Iwo Jima to return to the United States. 
Post-war disposition.
After stops at Saipan, Eniwetok, Johnston Island, and Pearl Harbor, she entered San Diego, California, harbor on 29 November and reported to the Commandant, 11th Naval District, for disposal. She was decommissioned at San Diego on 15 February 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 26 February 1946. The former net-layer was subsequently transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission for final disposition. She was sold to Joe Medina Enterprises, of San Diego, California, on 31 March 1947.
Honors and awards.
"Winterberry" earned one battle star for World War II.

Battle of Alegría de Álava

The Battle of Alegría de Álava ("Acción de Alegría de Álava" or "Batalla de Alegría"), a battle of the First Carlist War, occurred on October 27, 1834 at the field called Chinchetru, at Alegría de Álava, Álava, Spain. It was a Carlist victory. 
Carlist forces were led by Tomás de Zumalacárregui, who ambushed Isabeline (Liberal) troops under Manuel O'Doyle.
Background.
The Isabeline (Liberal) army under José Ramón Rodil, after a disastrous campaign during the summer of 1834, had attempted to destroy Zumalacárregui’s army and arrest Infante Carlos, Count of Molina. However, Rodil’s forces had been reduced by the Carlists by September 1834. Rodil was forced to give up command to Manuel Lorenzo. Rodil marched towards Madrid, taking with him as escort, as he approached Vitoria-Gasteiz, a division led by O'Doyle, which had belonged to the Liberal Army of Navarre. Rodil, without authorization, placed O'Doyle’s troops under the command of Joaquín de Osma, commander-general of the Basque provinces and who was based at Vitoria. 
The Isabeline troops of Navarre, thus reduced, were unable to keep up with the rapid movements of Zumalacárregui’s army. Zumalacárregui approached the Ebro with the intention of attacking the Riojan place known as Ezcaray, 40 km south of the river. Ezcaray was the site of important factories producing cotton cloths; Zumalacárregui wanted this cloth in order to create winter uniforms for his troops. Zumalacárregui’s scouts explored this area to carry out this plan. Zumalacárregui meanwhile received information on October 20, 1834 that a convoy of arms was traveling from Burgos to Logroño and that it would use the nearby royal road ("camino real") as it neared the Ebro. 
Zumalacárregui attempted to pursue the convoy on October 21 with four battalions and three squadrons, and he crossed the Ebro at Tronconegro. However, the convoy by now had passed. Zumalacárregui rapidly marched in pursuit of the convoy, but he was stopped at Cenicero by the urban militia there, which supported the Liberals and who were stationed at the church of Cenicero. Zumalacárregui was forced to go around the town and his cavalry managed to reach the convoy, which was in sight of Logroño. Zumalacárregui captured this rich booty, burned down the church of Cenicero, crossed the Ebro on October 22 at Tronconegro, and marched towards Navarre. His troops were then stationed in towns in the valley of La Berrueza. 
On October 21, at the last minute, the Liberals at Vitoria received news of Zumalacárregui’s incursion, and Osma ordered O'Doyle to march on the Ebro with his division, composed of the Queen's First and Second Regiments, the First African Regiment, the First and Second Regiments of Carabiniers, and the battalion of Bujalance. O'Doyle was ordered to march on the Ebro at Peñacerrada to cut Zumalacárregui off. 
O'Doyle reached Peñacerrada on October 22, during the afternoon, and learned that the Carlists were north of the Ebro. O'Doyle marched the next day through the valley of the Ega River, and his troops rested for the night at Lagrán. On the 24th, the Liberals reached Maetzu. The Liberal troops, exhausted and short on supplies, rested for a full day, the 25th. On the 26th of October, the troops left Maetzu, crossed the ridge of Andía, and after marching for 22 km, reached Alegría de Álava.
Osma then ordered O’Doyle to disperse the Liberal divisions; the only troops that should remain at Alegría de Álava would be the Queen’s First Regiment, First African Regiment, some of the cavalry, and two pieces of artillery, with the rest of the troops cantoned at Guevara (Gebara), Arroyabe, and Ullíbarri-Gamboa (Uribarri-Ganboa), locations that were 6, 12, and 13 km north of Alegría de Álava, respectively. 
O'Doyle disagreed with this order, and consulted his regimental captains, who also thought it was a bad idea. But they carried out the order, abandoning Alegría de Álava and occupying the aforementioned villages. O'Doyle wrote a letter to Osma, expressing his concern with the order. 
Zumalacárregui, meanwhile, was in the valley of La Berrueza, 48 km south of Alegría de Álava, and had in his sights, the Liberal troops at Los Arcos of General Lorenzo, who was waiting for reinforcements coming from Cirauqui led by Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri. Zumalacárregui’s aduaneros were watching the movements of the Liberal troops, and thus Zumalacárregui was well informed. Adauneros were also watching O'Doyle's movements, and when O'Doyle's troops left Alegría de Álava, the aduaneros notified Zumalacárregui, who received this news in the afternoon. 
However, Zumalacárregui did not have sufficient forces to face an entire Liberal division –but he did have enough to face a few battalions. He thus decided to head for Álava and engage with Liberal troops who were headed for the various aforementioned villages. At nighttime, Zumalacárregui left a few men behind to keep the campfires going and took his troops to Campezo, Zúñiga and Orbiso, where they spent the night. Now Zumalacárregui was 35 km from Alegría de Álava. The Liberal general Lorenzo, seeing the campfires that had been left going at La Berrueza, believed that Zumalacárregui's troops had remained there.
The battle.
On October 27, Osma arrived at an early hour at Alegría de Álava, explaining to O'Doyle his reasoning behind his order for the dispersal of the Liberal troops: Osma had received news that the pretender to the throne, Carlos, was at Oñate. O'Doyle’s divisions, now arranged as 4 columns, would depart from the town that same afternoon towards the north, marching at night, to reach Oñate by various routes and apprehend the pretender. 
The Carlist army meanwhile, fired by a ration of aguardiente given to them by Zumalacárregui (as was his custom before going into battle), was divided into 2 columns. One of the columns was under the command of Manuel Iturralde, and consisted of the Third, Fourth, Sixth Battalions of Navarre and the Second Battalion of Guipúzcoa, and had orders to climb the mountains from Saseta. The other column, commanded by Zumalacárregui, consisted of the Guías de Navarra, the First Battalion of Navarre, the Third Battalion of Álava, and the lancers of Navarre, and would advance from Ulibarri. 
As they traveled, the Carlists apprehended anybody they came across, such as people working in the fields, and placed them in an enclosure guarded by two soldiers; this they did to avoid anyone from alerting the Liberals of the presence of the Carlist troops. The Carlists soon came across no one around or in the fields, which they intuited signified the nearness of the Liberal army.
Zumalacárregui received news that Lorenzo was still not aware of the Carlist advance; Lorenzo remained at Los Arcos. Zumalacárregui would send a small number of troops to attack Salvatierra/Agurain, 10 km east of Alegría de Álava. Zumalacárregui would remain hidden with his troops, meanwhile, in the forest of Chinchetru, where they would wait for O'Doyle, who presumably would leave his HQ to defend Salvatierra. Iturralde meanwhile would descend from Saseta, hide in the woody mountain slopes south of Alegría de Álava, and, once O'Doyle departed towards Salvatierra, Iturralde would march in parallel. Once Zumalacárregui began the attack at Chinchetru, Iturralde would attack from the right against the Isabelines. 
As it happened, circumstances favored Zumalacárregui. When the Carlist general marched towards Chinchetru, he came across the governor of Salvatierra who was headed towards Vitoria with some prisoners. At 4:00 PM, O'Doyle's troops began to leave Alegría de Álava, heading towards the north, when the sound of gunfire erupted at Chinchetru. Zumalacárregui increased the overall sounds of gunfire by having his soldiers also fire into the air. Then, he hid in the forest north of the town of Alegría de Álava.
O'Doyle stopped heading north and headed towards the east instead, through the hills, a shorter route towards Chinchetru. The terrain was difficult; these foothills towards the range of Andía were woody and not suited for the passage of regular troops. Furthermore, the setting sun caused the weapons of the Liberals to glint brightly; this allowed Zumalacárregui to spot the Liberals easily from Chinchetru.
Zumalacárregui ordered the Guías de Navarra to leave the forest and ordered them to the plan between Chinchetru and these hills. The Isabeline vanguard, led by O'Doyle on horseback, was composed of mountain troops ("cazadores") and thus marched much faster than the main body of Liberal troops. The Liberal troops soon came across the Guías de Navarra, who were wearing their signature red berets, and were surprised to see the Carlists there. O'Doyle ordered an attack but the Liberal "cazadores" were quickly pushed back by the Guías de Navarra. 
When the rest of the Liberal troops arrived, Zumalacárregui ordered the rest of his troops into battle and fierce combat ensued. 
One source writes that: 
Meanwhile, the Carlist Iturralde also appeared, attacking the Liberal rearguard and its right flank. The Liberal troops, suffering from confusion, were unable to organize themselves in such a small space, and after having fired an initial volley, were unable to defend themselves from a fierce Carlist bayonet attack. The Liberal troops began to surrender. 
Meanwhile, the din of battle reached the local villages Guevara, Arroyabe, and Ullíbarri-Gamboa, where the remaining Liberal troops had been stationed. These Liberal troops began to march towards Chinchetru. But soon they encountered Liberal troops who had fled from what was amounting to a massacre, who informed them of what was happening. Thus, the retreating Liberal troops and the troops that had been stationed at these three villages fled to Vitoria, which they reached by nighttime.
Aftermath.
During the night, the Carlists searched the forests between Chinchetru and Alegría de Álava for Liberal troops who had survived the battle and were now hiding. Liberals who were discovered were bayoneted or shot on sight. 
The Carlists captured the two pieces of artillery that had belonged to the Liberal army, along with corresponding munitions, supplies, and the regimental banner of the Liberal Regiment of Africa. O'Doyle, O'Doyle's brother, and other officers surrendered, and were executed by firing squad the next day. 400 Liberal troops were taken prisoner. 
However, 250 Liberal troops and their officers maintained order and reached Arrieta by forced march, 3 km away from the field of battle, and they fortified themselves in the church at Arrieta. There they fought against the Carlists who pursued them all during the night. 
News of this action at Arrieta led Osma to the decision to send soldiers to the rescue of the troops at Arrieta, which would lead to the Battle of Venta de Echávarri (October 28, 1834).
Order of battle at Alegría de Álava.

Panksepp coined the term 'affective neuroscience', the name for the field that studies the neural mechanisms of emotion. He is known in the popular press for his research on laughter in non-human animals.
Research.
Panksepp has conducted many experiments; in one with rats, he found that the rats showed signs of fear when cat hair was placed close to them, even though they had never been anywhere near a cat. Panksepp theorized from this experiment that it is possible laboratory research could routinely be skewed due to researchers with pet cats. He attempted to replicate the experiment using dog hair, but the rats displayed no signs of fear.
In the 1999 documentary "Why Dogs Smile and Chimpanzees Cry", he is shown to comment on the research of joy in rats: the tickling of domesticated rats made them produce a high-pitch sound which was hypothetically identified as laughter.
Panksepp is also well-known for publishing a paper in 1979 suggesting that opioid peptides could play a role in the etiology of autism, which proposed that autism may be "an emotional disturbance arising from an upset in the opiate systems in the brain".

Sam Mehran

Sam Mehran " 'merr-anne' " (born August 18, 1986) also known as Sam Meringue, is an American Australian musician best known for being a member of short lived band Test Icicles, as well as having been in a large number of other side projects.
Early life.
Mehran was born in Miami in Florida, America. He moved to Adelaide, Australia when he was 7 years old. He began rapping at the age of 8 and was formed his first band, "Thunderbox", at the age of 12. He toured with Australian bands The Be-Bops, The Piggy Backs and "Wet Dream Warriors" when he was 16, before moving to Singapore, Brooklyn and then London. Once he had moved to London he became involved in a number of independent film and music projects. These were with Rory Attwell and Devonte Hynes in particular but would also frequently feature Ferry Gouw and Chris Steele-Nicholson of Semifinalists, Tim Sullivan of Damn Arms and Tom Vek. This resulted in a number of spontaneous, short lived bands, including "IntenseDudes".
Test Icicles.
Mehran and Gouw went on to form a competitive sports-themed band with Attwell named ""Balls"". However, Gouw needed to go home for the summer when Balls had been booked to play with The Unicorns in Nottingham. Not wanting to cancel the gig, Meringue and Attwell decided to form a Balls sister-band called Test Icicles. They recruited Dev Hynes to join them.
In early 2005 the three moved to a first-floor flat in Dalston where they recorded a large amount of demos and used MySpace as a key way of gaining fans and getting their music heard. They became signed to the independent label Domino Records and released an album "For Screening Purposes Only" but split in February 2006.
Post Test Icicles.
Prior to the band's split he was involved in a number of short lived projects, many with Hynes, including NLS Crew, Fish Trip, Trucker Dreams Inc, Testosterone Dream and Loose Leaf Syndicate but wasn't known to be involved with anything since. In 2010 however, it became apparent that Mehran has been active in the music industry at an underground level under the alias of Sam Meringue. A few of his 'projects' are - Matrix Metals, Yoga, Explorers, Blues Runner, Wingdings, Foxy Baby, Outer Limits Recordings, The Sweethearts and most recently Outer Limitz.

Validus DC Systems

Validus DC Systems is a provider of fully integrated Direct Current (DC) power infrastructures for datacenters and telecommunications facilities headquartered in Brookfield, Connecticut in the United States. The company’s power infrastructure is the first-ever end-to-end DC power solution for mission critical facilities and high-density data centers.
History.
Validus was founded in 2002 when Data Support Associates, Inc. (DSA), a company co-founded by Validus DC Systems’ founder and CEO, Rudy Kraus, provided $4 million of seed capital to start the company and begin development of Validus’ end-to-end DC-power solution for data centers. 
The Validus DC solution was developed in partnership with Dr. Marcel Gaudreau, former head of Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center. The final offering is the result of 5 years of development and more than 100,000 team hours.
AC means alternating current. DC means direct current.
AC vs. DC power.
Thomas Edison originally promoted DC for electrical power distribution, considering it a safer, more reliable option than AC power. Edison faced off against George Westinghouse and his AC system in the ensuing “Current Wars.” AC ultimately came out on top due to technological limitations of the time. AC had the advantage back then of being stepped up to high voltages by using transformers, sent via thin, inexpensive wires, and eventually stepped down again at distribution to the user site. Still, DC power has continued to be used in high voltage scenarios, as well as in low voltage deployments in the telecommunications industry and light transportation industry.
Today’s technology, however, enables users to leverage the advantages of DC power. As Edison realized, DC power represents a more stable option. Unlike the sine wave of AC, DC electrical charges flow in the same direction at a constant. This quality allows DC systems to not only offer greater stability (less equipment needed to synchronize sine waves), but also to enable easier integration of multiple power sources, since backup (or primary sources) such as photovoltaic, flywheels and batteries all produce energy in the DC format.
Additionally, current AC systems require a series of power conversions that result in energy being released in the form of heat, which then must subsequently be cooled. This power and cooling challenge has become a serious issue in the data center industry. The benefit of DC power includes a reduction in the number of power conversions, and therefore a reduction in cooling requirements.
AC vs. DC power for Data Centers.
In a typical data center, the redundant power distribution system provides 480-volt AC power through an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and then to a transformer, which then steps it down to 208-volt AC at a power distribution unit (PDU) to feed racks of servers. Within the UPS system, the 480 volt AC is converted to DC and charges batteries and then is converted back to 48 volt DC.
Individual power supplies (typically redundant) within each server convert the 120/208-volt single phase AC into a voltage appropriate for the unit’s needs. These individual supplies are often inefficient, generating substantial heat that the room’s air conditioning system must remove at great expense. This heat can also limit the number of servers that can be housed in a data center and can jeopardize data center reliability if not handled properly.
In total, there can be up to six or more power conversion stages between facility power entry and the microprocessor or other data processing circuits. The power losses due to the use of inefficient power conversion devices from both outside and within equipment result in a large loss of useful electrical power, as well as directly increasing the energy required to remove the heat produced. Thus, for every watt of power utilized to process data, about 0.3 to 0.1 watt is required to support power conversion. In addition, about 0.6 to 1 watt will be required to cool the power conversion equipment.
By skipping conversion steps, a DC-powered datacenter saves overall electricity use through eliminating extra power conversions and reducing datacenter cooling needs, increases equipment densities, and helps reduce heat-related failures.
Product offering.
Validus’ end-to-end solution begins with the Power Quality Module (PQM), which is an air-cooled, mission-critical grade rectification system that converts alternating current (AC) power from the utility to high voltage direct current (-575 V) power.
From the PQM, high-voltage DC power is fed to the Power Distribution Module (PDM-575) which acts as a common interface for all system components in the power infrastructure of the data center. The PDM-575 is a scalable switchboard that simply integrates and controls power distribution from multiple system inputs such as the utility, stored energy devices, photovoltaic systems, distributed generation equipment, wind turbines and batteries and provides the necessary critical load distribution of -575 VDC power to the Power Converter Units (PCU).
The enabling component of Validus’ DC power solution is the revolutionary Power Converter Unit (PCU) 120, which uses patented technology to efficiently convert -575 VDC to safe, usable -54 VDC power, distributing 120 KW of power to the server row. Located at the midpoint of each server row, the PCU-120 consists of four (4) 30 KW integrated, hot-swappable Power Converter Modules, (PCM-030), which are highly efficient power conversion devices that deliver regulated output to power any load demand up to 120 KW per PCU. An optional Power Distribution Module (PDM-055) designed specifically to distribute low voltage DC power short distances mounts adjacent to the PCU-120 and delivers -54 VDC to the point of use (server rack).
Normal or stored energy power in the Validus DC solution can be provided by batteries, photovoltaic devices, wind turbines, fuel cells, fly wheels or any DC source with the proper voltage. Typical modular battery cabinets with a battery charging system can be seamlessly integrated into the PDM-575 offering the equivalent functionality of a UPS system. The standard PBS battery cabinet system supports predefined battery backup run time and utilizes a ten year “maintenance free” battery system in a stand-alone or parallel configuration. Validus’ PQX is an air-cooled, AC powered, stand-alone battery charging system that includes an interactive LCD display for monitoring information and an automatic restart after a high-voltage shutdown event.
Validus’ “Hybrid Power” technology brings together attributes of AC system design and DC energy efficiency to promote scalability, reliability and modularity, as well as an improvement in energy efficiency by up to 40%.

Duke of Abrantes

Duke of Abrantes was an aristocratic title granted on three separate occasions and it refers to the Portuguese city of Abrantes (), located on the Ribatejo province. 
1642 - The Dukes of Abrantes (Spanish Title).
The title of Duke of Abrantes was a Spanish title granted by King Philip IV of Spain in 23 March 1642, to the Portuguese nobleman Afonso of Lencastre, Marquis of Porto Seguro.
Afonso was the second son of Álvaro of Lencastre, 3rd Duke of Aveiro, and he received the title of Duke as a reward for his fidelity to the Spanish monarchy. 
Bernardo de Carvajal y Moctezuma, 2nd Count of Enjarada, is an ancestor of the dukes of Abrantes, making them also descendants of Doña Isabel Moctezuma and finally, Aztec emperor Moctezuma II. These dukes were also owners of the "Palacio de los Toledo-Moctezuma", in Cáceres, Spain.
Once the Habsburgs were expelled from the Portuguese throne in 1640 (two years before this honour was granted), the title was never recognised in Portugal, but is still extant in Spain. The present Spanish Duke of Abrantes is Alexic Lukas Juan Nachios Carlos who is son of Felipe Carlos, Prince of Asturias making him also a Grandee of Spain.
1753 - The Dukes of Abrantes (Portuguese Title).
The title Duke of Abrantes, unrelated to the first and the only to have official recognition in Portugal, was granted by a decree issued by King Joseph I of Portugal, on 9 December 1753, to Ana Maria Catarina Henriqueta de Lorena, 3rd Marchioness of Abrantes and 9th Countess of Penaguião.
The King advanced "Dona" Ana Maria de Lorena, 3rd Marchioness of Abrantes, to the degree of duchess (for her lifetime, only), when she became the queen's Maid of Honour ("Camareira-Môr"), the highest palatine office for a lady. The same occurred, later, to her daughter Maria Margarida, when she became the 2nd Duchess.
List of the Duchesses of Abrantes:
Other Titles used by the Duchesses of Abrantes:
1808 - The Dukes of Abrantès (French Title).
Due to Portugal's refusal to join the Continental Blockade, Napoleon sent general Jean Andoche Junot leading an army to invade the country. Junot crossed the country towards Lisbon and he passed through the city of Abrantes, where his army found a safe place to rest before its advance towards Lisbon. Later, Napoleon awarded him the title of "Duc d'Abrantès" (French spelling), as a French victory title.
His wife, Laure Permont, a French writer, also used the title of "Duchess of Abrantès".
This title was never recognised by the Portuguese authorities.

Second request (law)

In United States antitrust law, a second request is a discovery procedure by which the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department investigate mergers and acquisitions which may have anticompetitive consequences.
Legal basis.
Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, before certain mergers, tender offers or other acquisition transactions can close, both parties to the deal must file a "Notification and Report Form" with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division.
If either the FTC or the Antitrust Division has reason to believe the merger will impede competition in a relevant market, they may request more information by way of "Request for Additional Information and Documentary Materials", more commonly referred to as a "Second Request".
Substance of request.
A typical second request asks to gather information about the sales, facilities, assets, and structure of the businesses which are party to the transaction. This frequently requires a large amount of documents to be produced, and law firms representing parties to a transaction in which a second request has been issued often must hire contract attorneys to review all the documents involved.
Parties to a transaction who feel that the second request is unnecessary or needlessly duplicative of information discovered earlier may appeal to either the FTC or the Antitrust Division (whichever agency issued the request).

Back for Good (album)

Back for Good is the seventh album of Modern Talking released on 30 March 1998 after the unexpected reunion of the duo. The 7th album of the German duo was released after almost 11 years of their absence. The album "Back For Good" is a collection of their previous hits which consists of 18 tracks, including four new songs, 13 previous hits in a redone format and 1 medley. Some of the earlier hits; however, were rehashed and arranged absolutely differently including "Lady Lai" and "Angie's Heart".
"Back for Good" entered the number one position in Germany on April 13, 1998 and spent total of five weeks at the top, it eventually earned 5 gold-awards in Germany alone for selling over 1,250,000 units. The album "Back For Good" spent total of 54 weeks on the German album chart.
"Back for Good" was also successful outside of Germany, topping the album charts of many other countries including Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and Austria. "Back for Good" eventually went on to sell over three million copies in Europe alone.
Music style.
The reunion of Thomas Anders and Dieter Bohlen as Modern Talking resulted in a different sound compared to their original 1980s sound. The duo came back recording their materials based on the demand of the central European markets. The singles including "You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98" consisted of up-tempo beats as well as raps performed by Eric Singleton. Most of Modern Talking's materials could no longer be viewed as Europop, instead they were pure Electronic Music numbers with an exception of some of the tracks on "Back for Good" including the re-packaged versions of "Lady Lai" and "Give Me Peace on Earth" and the new ballads "I Will Follow You" and "Don't Play With My Heart".

L'Île-d'Anticosti, Quebec

L'Île d'Anticosti is a municipality in the Minganie Regional County Municipality in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec. Its territory coincides with Anticosti Island, a large island in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.
Within the municipality, the main populated area is Port-Menier.
Officially the municipality was formed first in 1902 when Anticosti Island was separated from the County of Saguenay. But since the entire island was privately owned, there was no elected council to preside over the islanders, who were either servants of the landlord or employees of logging companies. Even after the island was owned again by the provincial government in 1974, it took another decade to put a working municipal organization in place. On January 31, 1984, the first council was finally sworn in.
Communities.
Port-Menier.
The village of Port-Menier is the hub of the island. Its population doubles in the summer with seasonal workers and tourists. The economic mainstays are outdoor tourism and forestry/logging. Services available in Port-Menier are: general and grocery stores, gas station, banking, restaurant, and lodging.
Time zone.
Anticosti Island is bisected by the 63rd meridian west, and as a result, the eastern part of the municipality is officially within the AST legislated time zone boundary. However, in practice, all of L'Île-d'Anticosti observes the Eastern Time Zone (EST and EDT).

If I Were You (play)

If I Were You is a 2006 play by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn. It is about an unhappy married couple who are given the chance to understand each other by discovering, quite literally, what they would do "if I were you".
Background.
This play was one of several attempts Alan Ayckbourn made to write a play involving swapping bodies. In 1990, "Body Language" was premiered, where a fat woman and a thin woman swap bodies from the neck down following a botched operation. And in 2002, in "The Jollies" a young boy is transported into an adult's body whilst his mother is transported into a young girl's body.
The play was written in January 2006, initially with the title "If I Were You", which was then altered to "I to I" before reverting to the original. However, there were no plans to produce the play that year, as the Stephen Joseph Theatre already planned to produce revivals of "Intimate Exchanges" and "Woman in Mind". However, on 21 February 2006, Alan Ayckbourn suffered a stroke. As a result, directorship of "Intimate Exchanges" passed to Tim Luscombe, and the production of "Woman in Mind" was eventually dropped altogether. Whilst in hospital, Ayckbourn decided to use his latest play as a goal to work towards. "I to I" was scheduled for the autumn slot vacated by "Woman in Mind" in June, rehearsed at the rehearsal studio at his home, and the play was announced to the public, now retitled as "If I Were You", in July.
It has been argued that "If I Were You" is part of a trend of Ayckbourn's adult plays taking inspiration from his family plays (in this case, "The Jollies", which also deals with the adjustments and insights of being someone else) – the first example being "Improbable Fiction" and its derivation from "The Boy Who Fell into A Book" and "My Very Own Story".
Characters.
There are five characters in the play. They are:
When Mal and Jill swap bodies, the actors continue playing their original body. (In other words, the actor who starts playing Mal later plays Jill in Mal's body, and vice versa.) This is in contrast to "Body Language" where the two actresses continued playing themselves in new bodies.
Setting.
The stage is split into three sections, each a room of the Rodales' house: Mal and Jill's bedroom, the kitchen, and the living room. Like the setting used in "Bedroom Farce" and "Private Fears in Public Places", scene changes are controlled by switching the lighting from one area of the stage to the other. However, in a setting unique to this play, the whole stage is also used to represent the showroom floor at Mal's place of work.
The original production at the Stephen Joseph Theatre was staged in the round, but the productions on the tour were staged in the Proscenium.
The play takes place over two consecutive days, one day for each act. The tones of the two acts are very different: the first act is amongst the darkest drama found in Ayckbourn plays, whilst the second act is almost farcical with a happy ending.
Synopsis.
Act One begins as the alarm in Mal and Jill's bedroom goes off, and Mal reaches for it. They rise for breakfast, and Sam, their son, tries to get Jill to sign a permission form for an after-school drama group without Mal knowing, but Mal finds the form and rips it up. It is unclear what Mal does not like about it, other than claiming acting is men prancing around in tights. Sam is openly contemptuous of his father, whilst Mal is openly disappointed with his son, unlike his daughter, Chrissie, who worked hard at school, found her man, got pregnant and got married (in that order). Mal's prized son-in-law, Dean, arrives at the house, and prior to setting off for work together, Dean speaks of how successful his marriage is (his proudest example being his wife making him cooked breakfast every day apart from Sunday when he makes her breakfast).
At work, Mal faces a number of problems involving customers and staff and handles them aggressively. He also tries to fend off calls on his mobile from a woman he has been having an affair with on lunch breaks. Meanwhile, at home, Jill confides with Chrissie, her daughter, that she knows of Mal's affair. Chrissie talks of her marriage in a far less positive light than her husband gave earlier, wondering if she has gone frigid after giving birth. Jill notices that Chrissie keeps rubbing her arm, and finds out that Dean sometimes hits her. After school, Sam's news that he got the part he wanted (in spite of no signed form) is little cheer to Jill. Mal and Dean return home having been out drinking, and Dean insists on driving Chrissie and the baby home in spite of Chrissie's pleas not to.
Jill and Mal also argue, with Jill clearly regretting not having worked for fifteen years. In a moment left on her own, Jill weeps and says "God help us". She and Mal go to bed. In the morning, the alarm goes off again, and this time, it is Jill who reaches for the alarm – except that she only reaches as far as Mal would have reached for it. In fact, Jill and Mal have sometime swapped bodies, and the act ends as they make this discovery.
At the start of Act Two, Mal and Jill hastily agree not to tell anyone what has happened and to act out each other's lives as normal. Sam notices something is strange – Jill (in Mal's body) daintily and meticulously cleans the kitchen surface, whilst Mal (in Jill's body) slouches and wears the most ghastly choice of clothes – but ignores it. Jill goes to work and, to Dean's astonishment, sets to work cleaning the furniture in the shop. She also defuses the problems that Mal created the previous day, although going a little over the top in dealing with a stressed member of staff.
Meanwhile, Mal has the chance to get to know his children better as they open up to him, believing him to be their mother. Mal is deflated to learn from Chrissie that Jill knew about his affair all along, but is horrified to discover what Dean has been doing to her. When Sam returns home, he reads out a passage to Mal (as Francis Flute playing Thisbe in "A Midsummer Night's Dream"), almost moving him to tears. When asking Sam about acting, Mal gives the game away that he is worried his son might be gay. When he learns the real reason Sam acts – that he has a crush on his female drama teacher – Mal proudly says "That's my boy!" When Dean returns home, Mal punches him on sight. Jill uses the opportunity to end Mal's affair by telling his mistress over the phone that it is too dangerous, pointing out that Jill has just attacked her son-in-law. Jill makes Mal a sandwich, giving Sam a chance to bond with his father. Sam puts his parents' strange behaviour down to aliens.
Mal and Jill retire to bed, and Jill says that if they ever get their own bodies back, she must start working again. In bed, in the middle of the night, they find they are back to normal. They agree not to forget what has happened and talk about it in the morning, and the play ends as they sleep in each other's arms.
Productions.
The original production at the Stephen Joseph Theatre had its first performance on 12 October 2006, and an opening night on 17 October 2006. featured the following cast:
The production team were:
In 2007, the production toured, with Richard Stacey replacing Andrew Brookes as Dean and Dominic Hecht replacing David Hartley as Sam. The other three roles were reprised, apart from the first three weeks where Terence Booth played Mal, temporarily replacing John Branwell, who was taken ill.
In 2010, Bill Kenwright mounted a new production of If I Were You, directed by Joe Harmston and starring original cast member Liza Goddard. This production opened on 18 May 2010 at the Theatre Royal Windsor prior to a national tour, with the following cast:
Critical reviews.
The Stephen Joseph Theatre production attracted considerable attention during its Scarborough run and the tour. In many of the reviews, attention was shared between the play itself and Alan Ayckbourn's decision to return to the theatre following his stroke. Those reviews which did so applauded Ayckbourn's decision to do to.
The comments on the play itself were equally positive in most of the reviews. Credit was given for the scene where Sam moves his father with his Shakespearian speech, the effective switch between the home and the furniture showroom, and ability of the two leading actors to switch roles halfway through the play.
The only major review with a negative slant came from Alfred Hickling of "The Guardian", who was critical over the lack of explanation for the body-swapping. However, other reviews were positive about the low-key way the switch was done.
Perhaps the most positive comment was made by Dominic Cavendish of "The Daily Telegraph": "If I were him, I'd take it easy for the next few months. If I were a West End producer, I'd book this sharpish."

Battle of Skerries

The Battle of Skerries, also named the Battle of Ardscull, was a battle in the Bruce campaign in Ireland – part of the First War of Scottish Independence – fought on 26 January 1316, resulting in a Scottish victory. It was part of the Irish campaign of Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce, king of Scotland. The site of the battle was Skerries near Ardclough in County Kildare.
The battle.
Edward Bruce, earl of Carrick, had landed in Ireland in May the year before, and been proclaimed king of the island in June, which the Irish population saw as a positive thing since Bruce's goal was to remove the English. 
Bruce continued on his march south, before again encountering the government forces in January. The Hiberno-Norman forces, summoned by the justiciar of Ireland, consisted of men such as John FitzThomas FitzGerald, Maurice FitzThomas FitzGerald, Thomas FitzJohn, John and Arnold Poer, Maurice de Rocheford and Miles and David de la Roche. Though these forces heavily outnumbered those of Bruce, internal strife broke out in the Anglo-Irish ranks, a fact that Bruce could take advantage of. Though suffering heavy losses, the Scots held the battlefield, effectively winning the battle.
Aftermath.
The official English account of the battle blamed unfortunate terrain and bad luck for the government forces' loss, not an entirely convincing explanation. The same account also claims that the Scots lost many of their greatest men, while their opponents only lost one man. After the battle the Scots withdrew to Leix, while the Anglo-Irish forces kept them under surveillance from nearby Castledermot, while their leader withdrew to Dublin. Here John Hotham, the king's envoy to Ireland, made a great effort to ensure the loyalty of the Irish nobles. By May, however, Bruce had returned to his safe base in Ulster, while Hotham had returned to his new position in England as Bishop of Ely.

Big Bad World is the fifth album by Plain White T's. It was released on September 23, 2008 by Hollywood Records. To promote the album, the Plain White T's launched a few webisodes, which together form the series "Meet Me in California".
Bonus.
The clothing store Aéropostale started selling the album. Buying it from there includes a limited edition Plain White T's t-shirt; also trying on a pair of jeans there gets you a code to type on Aeropostale's website for a free song download titled "Love at 10th Sight". This was also done with the latest Fall Out Boy album to increase awareness of the Aero brand. The free download is no longer available due to it being limited until midnight of the album release.
The single "Natural Disaster" is featured as downloadable content for the "Rock Band" series.
Reception.
The album received mixed reviews, with The Album Project giving the album a score of 2/5 and saying; "the new Plain White T's seem to be making music with the intention of not simply becoming a one hit wonder ("Hey There Delilah") and "making it big" but in the process have watered down everything." AbsolutePunk.net reviewer Chris Fallon gave the album a score of only 24%, saying "the band continues their steep decline by writing some of the cheesiest, most gimmicky songs even Kidz Bop wouldn't consider covering". AbsolutePunk later lampooned the record by claiming that album had sold 10 million copies, as their April Fool's Day joke of 2009.
However, the album also gained a positive reception from critics. About.com reviewer Bill Lamb gave the album 4 and-a-half out of 5 stars, praising the band for putting together "a charming, effortless sounding collection of 10 songs that will make any pop music loving fan's heart beat fast," and ended off by saying "this is simply one of the top pop records of the year." Allmusic reviewer Andrew Leahey gave the album 3 and-a-half out of 5 stars, saying "the[Plain White T's never attempt to recreate the magic that fueled "Hey There Delilah," focusing instead on slick, sunny songcraft with nary an acoustic guitar in sight," calling it "a refreshingly smart release that emphasizes the band's pop/rock leanings" and that they "deserve points for remaining grounded after a meteoric year."

Hanneke Beaumont

Hanneke Beaumont (born 1947 Maastricht, the Netherlands) is a Dutch-born sculptor.
She studied dentistry in the United States, but moved back to Europe, to Belgium, where she still lives today. Beaumont started her artistic studies in 1977 at the "Académie de Braine l'Alleud", then at "La Cambre" and in Anderlecht; she received her first solo exhibition in 1983.
An important turn in her career happened in 1994 when she was awarded, for her terracotta sculpture group "Le Courage", the major award of the Centre International d'Art Contemporain, Château Beychevelle. 
Shortly after, she participated in the second Exposiciòn Internacional de Esculturas en la Calle, organized by the Colegio de Arquitectos de Canarias, in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where her work was permanently installed. 
In 2005, the Beelden aan Zee museum made an important retrospective of her work in the Hague (Netherlands). More recently, in 2007, a very large bronze, titled "Stepping Forward", was installed in front of the new headquarters of the European Council of Ministers in Brussels. 
Many other public and private collectors have manifested great interest in her work. 
She now enjoys an international reputation with exhibitions in the US, UK, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, The Netherlands, Switzerland. She shows at the Contessa Gallery.
Hanneke Beaumont has said that she is “very much a clay person”, a persuasion apparent in the bold way the sculptor carves her forms (such as “Terracotta 78 & 82”), leaving their surfaces rough and unrefined. Neither man nor woman, Beaumont’s sculptures represent ‘Man’ in the broader sense, she addresses grand issues of the human condition. Many of Beaumont’s figures appear neither male nor female, neither young nor old. They do not appear as portraits of particular individuals, nor are they modeled after idealized human forms. Physically, they are approximations of human beings, and as such, they provide a way to consider, from a distance, general ideas about the nature of the human race.
Beaumont's sculptures are realized in Terracotta, Bronze and Cast iron.
Hanneke currently works in Brussels and in Pietrasanta, Italy.

Farm to Market Road 517

Farm to Market Road 517 (FM 517) is a farm to market road in the U.S. state of Texas.
East and West ends.
East end: FM 646 in Bacliff,TX
West End: North Alvin Bypass in Alvin,TX
Other Names.
FM 517 has many names on its journey.
From E Bayshore Dr (FM 646) in Bacliff to when FM 517 makes a sharp right turn to the west it is known as 9th street. It then turns right and the name changes to Avenue I. It continues as Avenue I until it makes a left turn where it turns into 29th street. It is called this until it meets with Texas 146. After Texas 146 it is just called FM 517 until it reaches Texas 3 where the name is changed to Main Street-Pine Drive. This continues until I-45 where it is changed back to just FM 517. It is called this until it ends at the North Alvin Bypass where the name is changed to Dickinson Road.
History.
FM 517 was first designated in 1945 on a route from the Brazoria County Line to San Leon (TX 146) via Dickinson (US 75). The Brazoria County line-Dickinson portion was cancelled in 1946. In 1948, FM 517 was extended west to TX 6 at Alta Loma. The Brazoria County Line-Dickinson section was added in 1952; the same year, the Dickinson-Alta Loma section was transferred to a newly designated FM 646. FM 517 was extended east in 1953 to Edwards Point, and then west to TX 6 at Alvin. In 1955, FM 517 was again extended east to TX 146, and extended west from TX 146 to FM 517 near San Leon in 1962. The San Leon-Texas City section was transferred to a newly designated FM 3436 (now FM 646) in 1982. The final change came in 1995 when the FM 646-San Leon section was transferred to UR 517.

Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shillong

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shillong () is an archdiocese located in the city of Shillong in India.
History.
An Archdiocese is a “diocese” or area under the jurisdiction of an Archbishop. In all there are 33 church districts or “Parishes” in the Shillong Archdiocese. The Cathedral Church was built over 50 years ago. Since it also has the “cathedra” – the seat or throne of the Bishop – it is known as a Cathedral Church. This place of worship stands on the very site of the first Church built by the German fathers (Salvatorians from Germany). The earlier 1913 building – the Church of the Divine Saviour – was a wooden structure. It was destroyed in the Good Friday fire of April 10, 1936. Built by the first Catholic missionaries to these hills, the Salvatorians from Germany, it was the first Catholic Cathedral Church in what was then the Mission of Assam. The Cathedral Church of Mary Help of Christians is the principal place of worship of the over 3,00,000 strong Catholics of the Shillong Archdiocese which covers the districts of East Khasi Hills and Ri Bhoi of Meghalaya.

Martin Quigley

Martin Quigley (born 1951 in Rathnure, County Wexford) is a retired Irish sportsman. He played hurling with his local club Rathnure and with the Wexford senior inter-county team in the 1970s and 1980s. Quigley is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have won an All-Ireland medal.
Playing career.
Club.
Quigley played his club hurling with the famous Rathnure club and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title with the club in 1971. It was the first of a famous four-in-a-row as further county titles were annexed in 1972, 1973 and 1974. These wins were converted into Leinster club titles in 1971 and 1973. Quigley won further county medals in 1977, 1979 and 1980. He continued his club hurling well into the 1980s, winning both county and Leinster titles in 1986.
Inter-county.
Quigley first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Wexford minor hurling team in the 1960s. He won a Leinster title in this grade in 1967 before later lining out in his first All-Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion and went on to claim a 2-15 to 5-3 victory. Quigley won second Leinster minor medal in 1968 before lining out in a second All-Ireland final. Cork were the opponents once again, however, the result was the same as 'the Rebels' took the title with a 2-13 to 3-7 win.
In 1969 Quigley moved up to the under-21 grade. In this grade he won a Leinster title in 1969 before later lining out in the All-Ireland final. A Cork team that he was well used to provided the opposition on that occasion and won the game by 5-13 to 4-7. Quigley added a second Leinster under-21 title to his collection in 1970 before later playing in his second consecutive All-Ireland final. Once again Cork provided the opposition, however, the game ended in a draw. The replay proved more conclusive as ‘the Rebels’ trounced Quigley's side by 5-17 to 0-8. In 1971 Quigley was appointed captain of the under-21 team. That year he collected a third consecutive Leinster medal before lining out in the All-Ireland final. For the fifth year in-a-row Quigley faced Cork in a championship decider and, unfortunately, Cork made it five out of five with a 7-8 to 1-11 victory over the Leinster men.
By this stage Quigley had already made his debut on the Wexford senior team. He won a senior Leinster medal in 1970 as All-Ireland champions Kilkenny fell in the provincial final. Galway were defeated in the penultimate game of the championship, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Cork, Quigley's bête noire an underage levels. For the first time ever the final would be contested over eighty minutes instead of the usual sixty. The game itself was an exciting affair with a record sixty-four scores and eleven goals in all. After a free-flowing game Cork emerged victorious by 6-21 to 5-10.
Quigley played in his next Leinster final in 1971. The Kilkenny team of that era, a team often described as the greatest of all time, provided the opposition on that occasion. In fact, it was the first of five successive defeats at the hands of Kilkenny in Leinster finals for Wexford; however, Quigley missed the 1972 decider.
In spite of a lack of success in the championship Wexford reached the final of the National Hurling League in 1973. On that occasion Limerick were the opponents, however, victory went to Wexford giving Quigley his first major title at senior level.
1976 saw Wexford and Kilkenny battle it out in the Leinster final for the seventh year in succession. ‘The Cats’ were going for a provincial six in-a-row and an All-Ireland three-in-a-row, however, Wexford shocked the reigning champions by 2-20 to 1-6. It was a trouncing that nobody expected and it gave Quigley his second Leinster medal. Wexford’s championship campaign nearly came unstuck in their next game against Galway. A high-scoring game ended in a 5-14 to 2-23 draw and a replay was forced at the newly opened Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. The second game was just as tense an affair, however, Wexford emerged victorious by 3-14 to 2-14. Their opponents in the All-Ireland final were Cork, a team looking for their first championship title since 1970 when they defeated Wexford. Quigley's side got off to a great start and led by 2-2 to no score after just six minutes, however, Cork settled down and were spurred on with an inspirational display by Pat Moylan. The sides were level at the interval; however, the second-half developed into what was arguably the finest final of the decade. Cork hung on to win by 2-21 to 4-11 as Quigley was left on the losing side.
In 1977 Wexford maintained their provincial dominance with another defeat of Kilkenny. It was Quigley's third Leinster medal and the defeat for ‘the Cats’ brought the curtain down on Eddie Keher’s inter-county career. Victory in the provincial final allowed Wexford to advance directly to the All-Ireland final. For the second year in-a-row Cork provided the opposition and another classic looked likely. Wet and windy weather severely hampered both teams, however, the game was still a close affair. For the second year in-a-row Quigley ended up on the losing side as Cork claimed a 1-17 to 3-8 victory.
In 1978 Kilkenny were back as champions of Leinster and Wexford had to go back to the drawing board. A new force in the province also emerged as Offaly won their first Leinster titles in 1980 and 1981. Quigley continued playing hurling well into the 1980s, however, after several defeats in the provincial championship he retired from inter-county hurling in 1988.
Provincial.
Quigley also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1973 as Leinster defeated Munster to take the Railway Cup. Quigley added further Railway Cup medals to his collection in 1974, 1975 and 1977.
Post-playing career.
Towards the end of Quigley's playing days the Gaelic Athletic Association celebrated its centenary year in 1984. Throughout the year a series of special events were held while special team selections were also named. While a special GAA Hurling Team of the Century was named, a special team of players who never won an All-Ireland medal was also selected. Quigley's brilliance as a player was recognised when he was picked in the left centre-forward position on that team.

The MidSouth Rail Corporation is a railroad line operated by Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) as a result of the January 1, 1994, acquisition; KCS began operating over MidSouth's line on January 11, 1994. The line ran from Shreveport, Louisiana, going east across Louisiana, and across the state of Mississippi, running through the cities of Vicksburg, Jackson, Meridian, and Artesia, Mississippi, then across the Alabama state line to Tuscaloosa, and finally (via Norfolk Southern Railway trackage rights) into Birmingham. Midsouth had two other branches, with one to Counce, Tennessee, and a disconnected line from Gulfport to Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Total mileage was worth of mostly former Illinois Central Gulf's east-west Shreveport - Meridian main line. 
Operations.
On March 31, 1986, MidSouth Rail Corp. was created to purchase of Illinois Central Gulf Railroad (ICG), with start up operations on April 1, 1986. Edward L. Moyers served as the railroad's first president. MSRC was mostly the ex-ICG route between Meridian, Mississippi, and Shreveport, Louisiana, with this line being built in 1833 by the Clinton and Vicksburg Railroad. On September 8, 1987, MSRC acquired the North Louisiana and Gulf Railroad and its subsidiary, Central Louisiana and Gulf Railroad, These properties were combined as subsidiary MidLouisiana Rail Corporation. 
On April 14, 1988, MidSouth merged with the Gulf and Mississippi Railroad, itself an ICG spinoff. MSRC operated this property under the name of SouthRail.
Kansas City Southern takeover.
On January 11, 1994, Kansas City Southern Railway took over operations of all of Midsouth Rail Corp.'s lines, creating its Meridian Corridor to connect with the Norfolk Southern Railway.

Veith House

Veith House is a neighborhood house whose mission is to meet the needs of children, individuals and families, with empowerment as an ever present goal. It is located at 3115 Veith St in the North End of the Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is just down the hill from one of Halifax's landmarks, The Hydrostone.
History.
Veith House's history dates back to the 1800s. The Halifax Protestant Orphanage (also known as the Protestant Orphan's Home) was in existence from 1857 - 1969. The orphanage was founded by Reverend Robert Fitzgerald Uniacke (rector of St. George Church) in 1857 and was previously located on North Park Street. This became home to a countless number of children, both girls and boys.
The orphanage was relocated to Veith Street where it was destroyed in the Halifax Explosion in 1917, claiming the lives of both children and staff. Of the 21 people present in the building at the time of the explosion, only six survived. At this site, a monument has been erected commemorating the lives of the children and staff members lost in the disaster.
Post-explosion.
Post-explosion, the orphanage was rebuilt, but by 1969 the orphanage closed its doors. The property was then transferred to the Halifax Children's Foundation, to be used as the Veith House Community Centre and is still running today.

German Steam Locomotive Museum

The German Steam Locomotive Museum ("Deutsches Dampflokomotiv-Museum") or DDM is located at the foot of the famous "Schiefe Ebene" ramp on the Ludwig South-North Railway in Neuenmarkt, Upper Franconia. This region is in northern Bavaria, Germany. The DDM was founded in 1977.
Facilities.
The museum is in the former locomotive shed ("Bahnbetriebswerk") at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg station. It comprises a 15-road roundhouse, a turntable, water cranes, a coaling facility and a "Ruge" coal crane in a newly built 'old fashioned' working coal yard.
History.
The locomotive shed was built in 1895 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways and extended in 1923 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. Amongst others, pusher locomotives e. g. DRG Class 95s (ex-Prussian T 20s) and Class 96s (ex-Bavarian Gt 2x4/4 Mallet locomotives) were stationed there. One example of a Class 95 may be seen in the museum.
Museum Locomotives.
Around 30 steam locomotives may be seen, including a Bavarian S 3/6 express engine, a Bavarian PtL 2/2 (a tiny tank engine known as the "Glaskasten", literally: 'glass box', the only complete surviving member of its class), a Prussian P 8 passenger train engine and a Saxon XIV HT. Deutsche Reichsbahn locomotives represented include Class 01, 03, 44, 50, 64, and 86 engines and there are Deutsche Bundesbahn Class 10 and 23 locomotives, as well as industrial engines. In addition there is a museum-owned narrow-gauge line on the land which is worked by steam and diesel locomotives. An electric express train locomotive, the DB Class 103, may temporarily be seen in the DDM as a museum locomotive.
Photos from the DDM.
Except where stated, all locomotives depicted belong to the DDM.
Other Vehicles and Exhibits.
Various steam locomotive parts are also displayed, such as the smokebox, wheelset and cylinder block from locomotive number 18 610 (S 3/6) as well as the sectioned boiler from a Prussian G 8. Other exhibits of railway history include a steam crane, a saloon coach from Adolf Hitler's special train that was used in 1955 by German chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, on his historic visit to Moscow, a snow plough, a dining car and a historical telegraph station.
In addition there is a large model railway layout (Theme: the "Schiefe Ebene").
Also from engine number 18 610 is its tender which is coupled to 18 612.
Railway Operations.
The museum runs trips over the "Schiefe Ebene" during the summer from Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg to Marktschorgast and the "Mönchshof" Brewery at Kulmbach. A Class 796 Uerdingen railbus is stabled at the museum for these services and steam locomotives are also employed.

Ceramic chemistry

Ceramic chemistry is a branch of inorganic chemistry that studies the relationship between the physical properties of fired ceramic glazes and their chemistry. Although ceramic technicians have long understood many of these relationships, the advent of computer software to automate the conversion from batch to formula and analysis has brought this science within the reach of many more people. Physical properties of glazes in fired products (like thermal expansion, hardness, index of refraction, color and melting temperature or range) are directly (but not solely) related to the chemistry. Properties of glass melts like viscosity and surface tension are also principally products of chemistry.
Technicians in the ceramic tile, tableware, artware, pottery, sanitaryware, glass, fiberglass, bottle glass, optical and related industries all use this science.
In ceramic chemistry, fired glazes are viewed as composed of oxides (examples are SiO2, Al2O3, B2O3, Na2O, K2O, CaO, Li2O, MgO, ZnO, MnO, Fe2O3, CoO). Each oxide is known to contribute specific properties to the fired glass. Materials suppliers publish chemical analyses of their products that cite percentages of these oxides as well as volatiles (oxides that burn away during firing like H2O, CO2, SO3).
For example, in traditional ceramics here are some examples of what the application of ceramic chemistry can accomplish.
In ceramic bodies the physical properties of the final fired product are more related to the firing curve, the physical properties (e.g. particle size and shape, decomposition history) of the ingredient materials and the mineralogy and interaction between the different particle types.

Peak 2 Peak Gondola

The Peak 2 Peak Gondola is a tri-cable gondola lift located in Whistler, British Columbia that links Whistler Mountain's Roundhouse Lodge with Blackcomb Mountain's Rendezvous Restaurant. It is the first lift to join the two side-by-side mountains. It holds world records for the longest free span between ropeway towers—3.03 kilometres (1.88 miles) and highest point above the ground—436 metres (1,430 feet.) (A temporary aerial tramway in Switzerland used between 1979 and 1986 had larger span.) The Peak 2 Peak Gondola was built by the Doppelmayr Garaventa Group in 2007 and 2008 at a cost of CDN$51 million. The Peak 2 Peak Gondola is the first Doppelmayr "3S" tri-cable lift in North America; there are four similar but smaller lifts in Europe which were built in 1991, 1994, 2002, 2004 and 2010 in Switzerland, Austria, France and Germany. Whistler-Blackcomb has touted the gondola as an iconic attraction and uses it to transport skiers in the winter months as well as sightseers year round.
History and planning.
Whistler Mountain was opened by the Garibaldi Lift Company in 1965 and Blackcomb opened under separate ownership in 1980. It wasn’t until 1997 when Intrawest, the owner of Blackcomb Mountain, bought Whistler Mountain and brought both mountains together on a single lift ticket. Ever since, many skiers wanted a way to be able to ski both mountains in one day without having to ski down to the village and ride multiple lifts to get back to the alpine. In 1997, Whistler-Blackcomb's Director of Mountain Operations, Hugh Smythe, and Paul Mathews, president of Ecosign Mountain Resort Planners, took a trip to Zermatt, Switzerland. After seeing the number of lifts connecting resorts around the Matterhorn, they got the idea of connecting Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains with a ropeway.
A number of problems prevented a connection for years. Fitzsimmons Creek and the steep faces on either side were unsuitable as ski terrain and are protected land. A traditional chairlift or gondola would have had to go all the way down one mountain, across Fitzsimmons Creek, and up the other side, resulting in a long lift ride and environmental impacts. A gondola that could cross the valley without going to the bottom was the best option. Whistler-Blackcomb had to consider the extremely high cost of building such a lift. The resort conducted research that indicated 92% of winter visitors and 86% of summer visitors would use the gondola at least once. HSBC Bank Canada and Scotia Capital agreed to provide Intrawest with financing for the project, allowing it to move forward.
Intrawest announced the gondola project to employees and the Municipality of Whistler’s Council on September 19, 2005, and held a community open house shortly thereafter. At the time, construction was expected to start in the summer of 2006 and continue for 2 years for an opening for the 2007-2008 ski season. On March 30, 2006, it was announced that construction would be delayed by one year. Whistler Blackcomb announced on April 17, 2007, that groundbreaking would occur in May 2007.
Construction.
Whistler-Blackcomb broke ground for the Peak 2 Peak Gondola in a ceremony on May 21, 2007. The Doppelmayr Garaventa Group would supply the gondola itself and Timberline Construction was the general contractor and Glotman Simpson were the Consulting Engineers. Fatzer AG of Switzerland would make the four track cables and one haul rope that would carry the gondolas across the valley while CWA, also of Switzerland, would build the 28 gondola cabins.
80 workers from Whistler Blackcomb, Doppelmayr Garaventa, and Timberline Construction worked throughout the summer of 2007. Work completed that summer included the relocation of the top terminals of the Solar Coaster Express and Catskinner chairlifts on Blackcomb, excavation of both terminal locations, foundations for both terminals, foundations for all four intermediate towers, and steel erection of towers 2 and 3. Construction stopped for the winter in November 2007.
During the winter, the remaining two gondola towers and each terminal’s machinery were built at the Garaventa factory in Goldau, Switzerland and the Doppelmayr factories in Wolfurt, Austria and St. Jerome, Quebec. Fatzer AG manufactured the four track cables and haul rope that would suspend the gondola cabins. The five spools of cable left Europe by ship on April 10, 2008. By the time construction started again in the spring of 2008, ten feet of snow still covered the mountains and concrete had to be transported up the mountain by helicopter. Towers 4 and 1 were completed in early spring using mobile cranes.
The five cables arrived in the Port of Vancouver, Washington, USA on June 9 and were shipped to Whistler via train, arriving on June 16. Vancouver, Washington was used because it owns the largest mobile harbour crane on the West Coast of North America. To handle the 90-tonne reels, a German-made Goldhofer heavy-haulage trailer and tractor made its way from Montreal, QC to Whistler to take care of the transport from the train yard up the mountain. The Goldhofer trailer has four sections with six axles, each. Each axle has eight wheels. The trailer also features a hydraulic sliding system, which enabled the reels to be unloaded from the railcars in Whistler without a crane. Since there is no crane to lift each reel onto the truck, this trailer features sliding steel plates that essentially scoop the load from the train and set it onto the trailer deck. The five cables were trucked up Blackcomb Mountain for pulling across the valley starting June 19. Their entire journey from Switzerland to the top of Blackcomb Mountain was coordinated by OmniTrans Corporation.
Each track cable was winched down Blackcomb Mountain to the valley floor, then up Whistler Mountain. While the cables were pulled for twelve straight weeks, terminal construction continued with the gondola machinery being mounted on concrete foundations. The drive terminal on Whistler Mountain had the gondola’s motors installed in an underground vault. After the gondola machinery was installed, steel enclosures were constructed and covered with a blue, translucent material.
On August 29 and 30, the two ends of the haul rope were spliced together in a braid to form a continuous loop that could pull the cabins. The splice was performed by Norm Duke of Wyoming, who is one of only a few splicers in North America. The splicing process took 14 workers from Whistler-Blackcomb and Doppelmayr Garaventa over 15 hours to complete. The 28 sky cabins arrived in Whistler starting on August 26. The first twelve cabins crossed the span on September 19, 2008 with a single Doppelmayr engineer, Mathias Zudrell, aboard. The remaining cabins were put on line and the system underwent extensive testing until its Grand Opening on December 12, 2008.
Criticism.
The impact of such an expensive project on lift ticket prices was always a concern, especially because the gondola would not open any new ski terrain. When the project was announced in 2005, residents were promised that Peak 2 Peak access would be an optional add-on to a lift ticket or season pass. In a 2005 open house, the resort estimated the additional cost on a season pass would be CDN $59. At the time, Whistler-Blackcomb was attempting to secure a tax exemption from the municipality of Whistler for the increased assessments caused by the new terminal buildings. When season pass prices were announced for the Peak 2 Peak’s inaugural season in August 2008, only early bird passes were allowed to decline the Peak 2 Peak option. Whistler-Blackcomb said it was "not specific" about the Spirit Pass when it had said the Peak 2 Peak access would be optional.
When construction was announced, it was claimed that no trees would be cut under the gondola's lift line, resulting in the smallest ground disturbance of any lift project in Whistler Blackcomb's history. When it came time to pull the ropes for the gondola, a swath of trees was cut under the entire lift.
In May 2007, Whistler-Blackcomb announced the naming rights to the gondola were for sale for an undisclosed price. Presumably they were never sold because the gondola has retained the Peak 2 Peak name.
Features.
Cables.
The cables were manufactured by Fatzer AG, a Swiss company that develops, manufactures and markets wire ropes worldwide. The Peak 2 Peak cables include four stationary track ropes, two in each direction, which act like railroad tracks for the cabins. Each track rope weighs approximately 90 metric tonnes. There is a single haul rope which moves in a continuous loop and pulls the cabins. This cable weighs more than 80 metric tonnes. There are a total of of cable on the Peak 2 Peak Gondola.
Terminals.
The Peak 2 Peak Gondola terminal buildings are the two largest lift terminals in the world. To create the concrete footings, platforms, masts, and columns, of concrete had to be trucked and helicoptered up the mountains. The Whistler terminal, which houses the drive motors and backup engines in an underground vault is 26 metres (85 feet) wide and 42 metres (138 feet) long and has 228 tonnes of steel. The Blackcomb Terminal is 26 metres (85 feet) wide and 48 metres (158 feet) long and contains 279 tonnes of steel. The Blackcomb terminal can house 15 cabins, the Whistler terminal 13 cabins in a cabin parking area when the system is not in use.
Towers.
There are four intermediate towers, two on Whistler Mountain and two on Blackcomb Mountain that support the cables, which range in height from 30 to 65 metres (100 to 210 feet). Combined, they contain 400 metric tonnes of steel.
Cabins.
The 28 CWA-manufactured gondola cabins hold 28 people each, with 22 seated and 6 standing. 26 of the cabins are painted red while 2 are painted silver and have glass floors.
Safety systems.
The Peak 2 Peak Gondola has a number of unique safety systems beyond what a normal ski lift features. The gondola has high wind stability and is designed to operate in winds up to 80 km/h. Whistler-Blackcomb has called the Peak 2 Peak Gondola the most wind tolerant lift on Whistler Blackcomb. Testing at other Doppelmayr 3S installations have measured sustained winds at 120 km/h (75 mph) with no decrease in performance.
The lift is powered by an electric motor on Whistler Mountain; however an auxiliary diesel engine can take over in the case of primary engine failure or if there is a power outage. The lift also has a redundant braking system. Both bullwheels have emergency brakes to stop the gondola if there is a primary braking system failure.
In the event of a catastrophic failure, an evacuation can be performed. For cabins that are near the terminals, passengers are lowered down by rope from the cabins. For cabins that are too high off the ground for a rope evacuation, cabins are winched along the track cables to towers 2 and 3 where passengers are then lowered to the ground by rope by Ski Patrol members.
In addition, the gondola is equipped with a state of the art Obstacle Collision Avoidance System that uses radar to alert aircraft of the gondola as an obstacle. Strobe lights and loud noises over all radio frequencies are used to alert pilots who come too close to the gondola.
In the media.
The grand opening ceremony on December 12, 2008 featured Steve Podborski as emcee and Red Bull Air Force members BASE jumping from the middle of the gondola.
The Peak 2 Peak Gondola was the subject of a 2009 Discovery Channel documentary. Crews began filming the project during groundbreaking in May 2007. The documentary aired at 9 pm on December 23 and at 2 am on December 24, 2009, on Discovery Channel Canada. It was titled "Peak 2 Peak: Building the Worlds Biggest Gondola". The gondola was also featured in the History Channel's show Modern Marvels in the episode "Winter Tech," which showed the technology behind the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games.
On February 6, 2014, a man carried out an illegal BASE jump from the highest point of the Peak 2 Peak Gondola and landed safely in the valley below. In order to exit the gondola, he and a female accomplice had to pry open the doors causing an estimated $10,000 worth of damage. They posted a video of the jump on YouTube as a tribute to Shane McConkey. On February 13, 2014, the RCMP announced that they had arrested the woman and recommended charges of obstruction and mischief over $5,000. One day later, BASE jumper Mike Douglas condemned the stunt saying "This guy seems to have gone about it in all the wrong ways. He caused a lot of damage in the process which I think is not cool."

Upon graduating, Jiawen (Cynthia Koh) joins E-max, a distributor dealing in high-end technology products, as a salesperson. Due to her hardworking and honest nature, within a short period of time, she is promoted to brand assistant. Shuling (Lavin Seow) is a friend of Jiawen’s from university.
Both young ladies join E-max around the same time. On the surface, it appears that Shuling is very friendly towards Jiawen. However, she is in fact jealous of the latter because she is doing better than her in both career and love.
Meishan (Phyllis Sim) is Jiawen’s good friend from secondary school. She has a crazy and fun-loving character, but she is a capable assistant of ZiKang’s in Lin Zhi Technologies. ZiKang (Alan Tern) is the senior brand manager at Lin Zhi Technologies with a successful career. However, his wife finds out that he has been unfaithful and insists on divorcing him. ZiKang is unable to save his marriage. Meishan is also having an affair with a married man. She feels that true love is all about sacrifices. Therefore, she carries on suffering in silence as the third party.
ZiKang feels that there is no hope for her relationship. Later on, ZiKang begins to feel attracted to Meishan’s lovable and unique character. He wishes to woo her, but Meishan does not believe that a playboy like ZiKang would fall for her.
In order to climb to a higher rank, Ella (Cai Peixuan) makes use of Jimmy, an assistant brand manager at Lin Zhi Technologies, to get a position in the company. Jimmy (Kelvin Liew) feels that Ella’s competitive edge, enthusiasm and confidence reminds him of himself. Thus, they begin making use of each other to attain their individual goals in their respective careers. However, Jimmy makes a mistake at work one day and pushes the blame on to Ella to save himself. This causes them to fall out and become enemies.
Ella joins E-max under Meishan’s recommendation. When Shuling pulls a trick to sabotage Jiawen, Ella takes the opportunity to take over Jiawen’s position. During this time, ZiJian suggests a break-up with Jiawen, because of Shuling’s intentional disparagement. Jiawen suffers yet another blow. When she is at her lowest and most depressed, Jiawen’s junior and good friend, Yiping (Kyo) stays by her side to give her encouragement. They slowly begin to fall in love, but Jiawen has always minded the fact that Yiping is younger than her.
Yiping’s persistence and patience finally pays off and moves Jiawen. However, Jiawen still holds a torch for ZiJian (Alan Yun) deep inside. Yiping knows that Jiawen has not forgotten ZiJian, but continues to stay by her side. He compromises and gives in to her, hoping that one day she will break free of the inhibitions of seeing a younger man.
After Ella leaves the company, Jimmy realises that he has fallen in love with her. He tries every way to make amends and apologize to her, and finally gains her forgiveness. One night, they get drunk and end up having sexual intimacy. Soon after, Ella discovers that she is pregnant. Refusing to give up and jeopardize her career, she plans to get an abortion. As a result, she suffers from depression.
Jimmy finds out that Ella is pregnant with his child and immediately stops her from going through the abortion. He confesses that he is an orphan and has always wished for a happy family. Jimmy decides to give up a good opportunity for advancement at work, and applies for a long holiday to take care of Ella back in their hometown. Ella deeply appreciates his sincerity. She decides to marry him and keep the baby.
Shuling gets close to her boss Frankie Chen Jinghua and tries her best to please him. She goes so far as to even become his mistress. With her special status, Shuling continuously makes things difficult for Jiawen at work. She even slanders Jiawen behind her back, thus making Frankie distrust Jiawen. Jiawen reaches a point where she can tolerate no more, and decides to retaliate. Ella decides to join hands with Jiawen to deal with Shuling, after some careful consideration.
The boss’s wife finds out about Frankie’s affair with Shuling, and Shuling is forced to resign. Shuling is furious and feels that the whole world has done her wrong. One day, she loses control of her emotions and causes the death of her childhood sweetheart. From then onwards, Shuling starts to become mentally unstable.
ZiKang tries his best to change himself so that he can be a better match for Meishan. He works hard to show his love for her through actions, again and again. Meishan is finally moved by his sincerity and agrees to his marriage proposal. Jiawen sees that Ella and Meishan have both found happiness with their life partners, and is happy for them. Yiping proposes to Jiawen, but she hesitates in her answer. At this point, ZiJian realizes that the one he loves most is still Jiawen. He wishes to start afresh with her. Caught between two men who love her, Jiawen is unsure of how she should end this love triangle…

HMS Mermaid (1784)

HMS "Mermaid" was a 32-gun "Active"-class fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy, launched in 1784 and broken up in 1815. During the French Revolutionary Wars she served in the West Indies, the Channel, and the Mediterranean. During the Napoleonic Wars she first served in the Americas, but from early 1811 on she was armed en flute and served as a troopship until she was broken up.
Design and construction.
"Mermaid" was one of the eight ship "Active" class, designed by Edward Hunt. She was initially ordered from the shipwright George White, of Woolwich Dockyard Shipwright on 27 August 1778, and laid down in September 1778, but the order moved to John Jenner in April 1779. On 21 March 1782 the order was canceled and moved instead to Thomas Pollard, at Sheerness Dockyard, and the frigate was again laid down, on 29 July 1782. She was launched on 29 November 1782, and commissioned for the ordinary on 30 December 1784. She was commissioned again between June and August 1790 for sea. She had cost £12,854 to build, with another £2,539 paid for her fitting out in 1790. The Woolwich work had cost £1,807.
Early career.
"Mermaid" was commissioned under Captain Cuthbert Collingwood in June 1790 during the Nootka Crisis. She sailed to the West Indies, but returned in April 1791 and was then paid off.
French Revolutionary Wars.
She was again fitted out, this time at Portsmouth for £3,446, between February and May 1793, commissioning in March that year under Captain John Trigge. She was assigned to the Mediterranean, departing Britain on 22 May 1793. On 27 May she and captured the 20-gun privateer "Général Washington", and on 30 May 1793 "Mermaid" and captured the 16-gun privateer "Angélique". "Mermaid" also captured a 14-gun privateer in June that year. "Mermaid" then joined Admiral Samuel Hood's fleet at Toulon.
The Caribbean.
She came under the command of Captain Henry Warre in June 1794, and then sailed to the Leeward Islands on 5 May 1794. Then "Mermaid" captured the 10-gun "Brutus" off Grenada on 10 October 1795. However, the brig's crew of 50 men, together with some 120 troops, were able to get ashore before "Mermaid" could capture them. "Brutus" had been in the company of a ship, which temporarily escaped. However, on 14 October "Mermaid" was able to find and capture the ship after a fight that cost "Mermaid" one man killed and three men wounded. The French ship was the "Républicaine", and she was armed with eighteen guns and had some 250-260 men aboard at the start of the action, one of whom was a French general on his way to take command of Grenada. In the action, the French lost 20 men killed and some wounded. shared by agreement.
On 30 October 1795 Robert Waller Otway received promotion to post-captain; he took command of "Mermaid" the next month at Grenada. In February 1796 "Mermaid" briefly came under the command of Captain Charles Davers, but by April Otway had returned. 
At the time Grenada and several of the other islands were in a state of insurrection, with the slaves joining the French inhabitants under the leadership of Victor Hugues in opposition to the British. "Mermaid" was off Labaye, in company with "Favorite", when a British blockhouse came under attack from a battery that the rebels had erected. Otway led a landing party of seamen and marines that stormed the battery and destroyed it. Soon thereafter, a large contingent of British troops landed near Labaye. At the same time two French vessels, under British colours, arrived with French troops from St. Lucia. The British general wished to withdraw, but Otway declined to permit him to do so. Instead, Otway rode up a hill on which there were some field guns, where he instructed to fire on the French vessels. The battery commander did so, with the result that the French vessels withdrew, having failed to land their troops. "Favorite" pursued the French vessels but could not keep up after losing her topmast. The British troops then attacked and captured Pilot Hill.
On 22 July "Mermaid" and recaptured the sloop "Two Sisters". 
Then on 8 August, Rear-Admiral Pole, in , was lying at The Saintes with several British vessels, including "Mermaid", when a strange vessel was sighted. Pole dispatched "Mermaid" to investigate. The vessel turned out to be the 40-gun French frigate "Vengeance". An engagement ensued in which "Mermaid", although "Vengeance" outgunned her, managed to inflict heavy casualties. When the 40-gun British frigate came up "Vengeance" retired, taking refuge under the batteries in the roads of Basse-Terre. "Mermaid" suffered no casualties, but later reports were that the French had lost 12 men killed and 26 wounded.
"Mermaid" and , on 10 December 1796, captured the French brig-corvette "Général Leveau", of 16 guns and 80 men, off San Domingo. On the south side of the island "Mermaid" also captured a Dutch brig, which was carrying several thousand dollars and a cargo of dry goods, and a Spanish schooner, which was carrying raw hides. "Mermaid" then captured the privateer "Liberté Générale" on 7 March 1797. 
On 20 April 1797 "Mermaid" formed part of a squadron under Captain Hugh Pigot, in the 32-gun frigates , that also included , the 14-gun brig , and the cutter . The squadron cut out nine ships at Jean-Rabel without suffering any casualties. Most of the ships the British were able to cut out were actually British merchant vessels that French privateers had captured.
English Channel and the Mediterranean.
James Newman-Newman took command of "Mermaid" around mid-1797. "Mermaid" captured "sundry prizes" between 28 December and 1 January 1798, and 16 January and 28 February. She also shared in 's capture or recapture of "Aventure", "Hazard", and "Daphne", and with "Phaeton" and a number of other vessels in the capture or recapture of the chasse maree "Marie Perota", the "Sea Nymphe", the "Mary", and an unnamed French sloop. 
Additionally, on 19 February "Mermaid", "Phaeton", and , and recaptured the "Lighthorse". Two days later, "Mermaid" and "Sylph" met up with "Phaeton", having captured an American vessel, the "Eliza", which had sailed from Batavia for Amsterdam via Boston, where she had changed her papers but not her cargo. "Phaeton" sent "Sylph" into port with the "Eliza" and the French privateer "Legere", which "Phaeton" had captured. In addition to "Mermaid", "Phaeton", and "Sylph", "Anson" and "Nymphe" shared in the proceeds of the capture of both vessels. The same squadron shared in the recapture, on the next day, of the Danish Indiaman "Graff fon Bernstoff". On 21 May "Mermaid" captured the "Two Brothers"; and the hired armed cutter "Cygnet" shared in the proceeds of the capture.
While patrolling off the Penmarks on 29 June 1798 "Mermaid", and came across the French frigate "Seine", which was bound for Lorient. The British squadron manoeuvred to cut "Seine" off from land, but "Mermaid" soon lost contact, leaving "Pique", under Captain Milne, and "Jason" under Captain Charles Stirling, to chase down the Frenchman. 
The chase lasted until 11 o'clock at night when "Pique" was able to range alongside the "Seine" and fire a broadside. The two exchanged fire for several hours, with the lighter "Pique" suffering considerable damage to her masts and rigging. "Jason" then arrived and Captain Stirling called upon Milne to anchor, but Milne did not hear. Determined to see the "Seine" captured, "Pique" pressed on but suddenly ran aground. "Jason" too ran aground before she could swing way. Furthermore, "Seine" was observed to have grounded and to have lost all her masts in the process. As the tide rose the "Seine" was able to swing into a position to rake the two British ships. With difficulty the sailors of "Jason" dragged several guns to the bow in order to exchange fire, while "Pique" was able to bring her foremost guns to bear. Already under fire from both British ships, the appearance on the scene of "Mermaid" convinced the French to surrender. "Jason" had lost seven killed and 12 wounded, while "Pique" sustained casualties of one killed, one missing and six wounded. "Seine" however had 170 killed and 100 wounded.
"Mermaid" was next involved in the capture of the French frigate "Loire" in the aftermath of the Battle of Tory Island. 
"Mermaid" was detached to operate off Corunna and together with "Sylph", captured the Spanish packet "Golondrina" on 24 March 1799 after a 15-hour chase. "Golondrina" was pierced for 20 guns but was carrying only four. She was under the command of Don Juan El Busto and was 39 days out of Havana on her way to Corruna with a cargo of sugar, cocoa and indigo. Newman described her as being of 200 tons burthen, coppered, and a remarkably fast vessel. 
In April 1799 Captain Robert Dudley Oliver, replaced Newman-Newman in command of "Mermaid" off France and Italy. Thereafter "Mermaid" appears to have spent much of her time patrolling the coasts and intercepting coasters. On 4 December "Mermaid" captured the Portuguese vessel "Voador". 
On 10 and 11 January 1800, "Mermaid" captured the French privateers "Redoubtable", "General Massena", and "Vengeur". A month later, on 10 February, "Mermaid" recaptured a Neapolitan brig that was on her way from Palermo to Leghorn with a cargo of "locusts". "Mermaid" was in sight but too far away to render assistance when , of 24 cannons, captured the brig "Ligurienne", of 16 cannons, and drove the ship "Cerf", of 14 guns, and the xebec "Joliet", of six guns, on shore. The whole action took place under the guns of two shore batteries and so close to shore that "Peterel" grounded for a few minutes.
On March 10 and 11, "Mermaid" captured three French merchant vessels:
Between March 15 and 16 "Mermaid captured seven merchant vessels:
Between 2 and 6 April, "Mermaid" captured and destroyed nine merchant vessels that were carrying grain and wine to French forces at Genoa. The vessels had take refuge under the guns of a fort in the small islands off Cape Croisette, south of Marseilles. One evening Oliver anchored "Mermaid" within grapeshot of the fort, which he cannonaded for an hour while two boats went in and cut out six vessels. The British suffered no casualties. 
On 11 May, "Mermaid" captured the settee "St Joseph", which was selling from Sardinia to Marseilles in Ballast. Four days later "Mermaid" captured the Genoese settee "Nostra Dame de Rosario", which was carrying wheat from Marseilles to Genoa. Four days after that "Mermaid" captured a settee, in ballast.
Then on 1 June about 12 leagues southward of Les Hières "Mermaid" captured , which was eight hours out of Toulon. "Cruelle" was a brig of six guns, four of which she had thrown overboard during the chase, and had a crew of 43 men under the command of "Ensigne de vaisseau" Francis Xavier Jeard. She had been a bomb vessel but had left her mortar at Toulon. She was carrying supplies for Malta when "Mermaid" intercepted her. The British took "Cruelle" into service under her existing name. 
In the month between 19 July and 20 August, "Mermaid" captured ten vessels, five of which she burnt or scuttled. Four were the French settee "Bien Venue", which had been sailing from Fréjus to Marseilles with deals (long wooden planks), the French settee "San Antonio", which was sailing from Oneglia to La Silva with a cargo of snuff, the French settee "Saint Pierre", which was sailing from Bandol to Marseilles with firewood, and an unnamed Spanish settee carrying barilla. "Mermaid" ran one French settee, which was carrying wheat, ashore and scuttled her too. The three vessels "Mermaid" kept were the Spanish sloop "Saint Juan Baptiste", which was sailing from Cette to to Genoa with wine, an unnamed Spanish settee carrying barilla, the French settee "Sainte Barbe", which was sailing from Marseilles with wheat, the French ketch "Notre dame de la Providence", which was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa with wine and flour, and the Genoese settee "Conception", which was sailing from Bandol to Genoa with wine.
On 11 October "Mermaid"s boats cut out from La Vendour four vessels carrying wine and flour.
On 18 February 1801, "Mermaid" and captured the ship "Esperanza" (or "Esperance"), which had sailed from Tunis with a cargo of silk, cotton, and other merchandise. Three days later, "Mermaid" captured the Genoese settee "Beato", sailing from Selloa to Port Maurice with wine. The next day, "Mermaid" captured three settees:
Then on 17 May "Mermaid" captured the French transport brig "Barthelemy", which was sailing from Toulon to Cartagena. After the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, which ended the war between Britain and France, "Mermaid" returned to Britain where in August 1802 she was paid off and placed in ordinary at Woolwich.
Napoleonic Wars.
"Mermaid" was fitted out again between June and September 1803, commissioning in August that year under Captain Aiskew Hollis. She spent the period between 1804 and 1807 at Jamaica. During the first half of 1804 "Mermaid" recaptured the British ship "Stranger".
"Mermaid" was at Havana in October 1804 when war with Spain was declared. He successfully brought some British merchant ships in the harbour out and then convoyed them to safety. 
She was then on the Halifax Station. On 6 July 1806 "Mermaid" and captured the American brig "Jennet". "Mermaid" was paid off again on 20 August 1807. 
"Mermaid" returned to service after being refitted at Woolwich between September 1808 and March 1809. She was recommissioned in February 1809 under Captain Major Henniker. She then sailed on 12 June 1809 with a troop convoy bound for Portugal.
She was recommissioned as an 18-gun troopship in January 1810, and was fitted out as a troopship at Chatham Dockyard between October 1810 and February 1811. She came under the command of Commander William Henry Percy in 1811. Percy and "Mermaid" then transported troops between Britain and Iberia for the Peninsular War. 
By April 1812 "Mermaid" was under Commander David Dunn, serving in the Mediterranean. In October 1813 she participated in the attack on Trieste.
On 30 November, , "Furieuse" and "Mermaid" embarked 1,000 men of the Italian levy, under the command of Lieut-Colonel Catanelli, at Milazzo. "America" and "Termagant" joined them. They sailed the same evening and, accompanied by "Armada" and "Imperieuse", landed them at Viareggio. Some 600 cavalry and infantry from the Livorno garrison attacked the troops, who routed them, capturing two field pieces and a howitzer. From the prisoners they learned of the weak state of the garrison and asked to be re-embarked to be taken to Livorno. Boats of the squadron towed them off the shore in country vessels and the ships towed the whole to the Livorno roads. The troops and marines landed on the evening of 13 December and they occupied the suburbs of the town. Some 700 cavalry and infantry attacked the marines, who opened to let the cavalry pass through them, killing all but 14 men and two officers. Of these, the Italian levy killed all but one officer. The marines charged and routed the remainder, killing, wounding or taking prisoner between 250 and 300 men. "Edinburgh" had three marines wounded. The 1000 men of the Italian Levy , marched inland and captured Lucca. They then returned to Via Reggio. There was further fighting around Pisa and Via Reggio before the expedition re-embarked aboard the British warships.
In early 1814, a British squadron, consisting of , , , "Mermaid", , and joined a force of 1500 Austrians to capture Trieste and its 80 guns.
Fate.
"Mermaid" was first offered for sale at Plymouth on 9 August 1815. The buyer had to post bond of £3000, with two sureties, that he would not resell her and that he would break her up within 12 months from the date of sale. She was broken up at Plymouth in November 1815.

Nicolai Gedalia

Nicolai Gedalia (1857 – November 13, 1880) was a Danish stock broker who dealt primarily in mining stocks. His father was a leading financier in Denmark and a financial agent of the Rothschilds in Copenhagen. Gedalia was a member of the Mining Board in New York City.
Prestigious father, education, and employment.
His father was a Hebrew whose parents were destitute. As a youth he was apprenticed to a saddler in Copenhagen and he worked as a journeyman saddler there for years. He saved enough through business and speculation to open his own saddling firm and later a banking house in the Danish capital. His success as a speculator enabled him to become the agent of the Rothschilds in Denmark.
He was bestowed the title of baron by the Austrian government after he helped them in several financial transactions. He served as the counsul general of Portugal in Copenhagen and received the Order of Jesus from the King of Portugal. He encountered financial reverses in 1875 and 1876, finally going bankrupt after unsuccessfully speculating in railroads. He came to the United States in 1877 and attempted a new career which did not achieve a desired result. He returned to Denmark where he began a small banking business. 
Nikolai Gedalia was educated in the office of his father in Copenhagen. He maintained an office at 70 Broadway, Manhattan after starting as a broker in the United States, in 1879. He was employed for a time by W.W. Hanly at 60 Broadway. His aged mother and an
elder brother resided with him in a "French flat" on 58th Street near First Avenue (Manhattan).
Suicide.
Gedalia was unable to make good on losses on two hundred shares of stocks, which were eventually sold by the Mining Board. His embarrassment regarding the decline of his finances continued even after his friends assisted him in settling with his creditors. He was forced to sell his seat on the board and looked for employment with either a bank or a broker's office. Gedalia stayed away from his office for a week after becoming depressed.
He shot himself in the temple with a pistol at the age of 23, dying in his bedroom in November 1880.

Challenge grant

Challenge grants are funds disbursed by one party (the Grant Maker), usually a Government Agency, Corporation, Foundation or Trust, (sometimes anonymously) typically to a non-profit entity or educational institution (the Grantee) upon completion of the challenge requirement(s). The "challenge" refers to the actions or results that must be achieved before money is released and usually involves substantial effort, so that the recipients know that they are helping themselves through their own hard work and sacrifice. 
Challenge Grants: 
A typical requirement is similar to matching funds where funds be raised or acquired from other sources following a stated matching factor, often 2:1, 3:1 or 4:1. For example, a $1,000 challenge grant with a 3:1 match would require the recipient to raise $3,000 before they would receive the $1,000 grant. 
The challenge could require a new solution to an existing problem that had been ignored. There could be additional requirements specified that could be virtually anything, from program certification to member participation.

Food and water in New York City

Watershed Protection and Local Food.
New York City government officials, labor organizers, non-profits, community advocacy groups, and residents have fostered a strong relationship with rural farmers to develop New York City's Local food shed. The process of linking sustainable, rural agriculture with New York City’s urban markets has been largely built upon the fact that New York City's water supply comes from New York State, in the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration process, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States with drinking water pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants.
With the largest surface storage and supply complex in the world, New York City's water supply system yields of water daily, with most of this water originating upstate. This water is not filtered, since a filtration system would require $6 billion in construction, and $300 million in annual maintenance. Instead, New York City's watershed is protected by severe New York City Department of Environmental Protection restrictions that prevent pathogens and nutrients from entering the water supply. These restrictions limit industrial development and restrict agricultural runoff. The implementation of such stringent regulations, however, threatened New York State farmers with utter devastation.
To protect the water supply from runoff and promote regional agriculture, rural and urban New Yorkers developed an alliance called the "New York City Watershed Whole Farm Program", which promotes sustainable agriculture in New York State. Farmers upstate, with financial assistance from the city, work to reduce pathogen, nutrient, sediment, and pesticide runoff. Meanwhile, New York City’s urban population serves as a local market for upstate farmers, particularly through Greenmarket [http://www.cenyc.org/greenmarketmanages] Farmers' markets, founded in 1976 by the Council on the Environment of New York City. 
The program provides regional small family farmers with opportunities to sell their fruits, vegetables and other farm products at open-air markets in the city. The most famous is the Union Square Greenmarket, held Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays between 8 AM and 6 PM year round. 250,000 customers a week purchase 1,000 varieties of fruits and vegetables at the market.
International Model.
Because of the way in which urban and rural New Yorkers have cooperated to create a healthy, protected ecosystem that brings healthy, Local food and clean water to a large urban population, New York City has become an international food systems model. With its headquarters in New York City, the United Nations has offered New Yorkers a chance to showcase their food system on the international stage, with New York farmers, workers, retailers, and NGOs acting as important representatives to the UN's Commission on Sustainable Development. New York hosted the UN's City and Farm Linkages Showcase in May, 2008 to impress international leaders with New York State's project that links urban markets with rural farms to revitalize regional, sustainable agriculture.
Supermarket Crisis.
Like many other cities in the United States, New York City faces a supermarket shortage that is closely linked to health epidemics. At the request of the Mayor’s office, the Department of City Planning studied supermarket need in the City and, in April, 2008 found a widespread shortage of supermarkets. This shortage causes a lack of healthy, fair-priced food options for many New Yorkers who live in a food desert. Food access issues are partly responsible for the facts that diabetes now affects over 700,000 people in New York City, over 1.1 million New Yorkers are obese, and another 2 million are overweight. 
Health problems are especially prevalent in minority communities, and statistics indicate a racial dimension to the crisis: supermarkets in Harlem are 30 percent less common than on the Upper East Side, and while 20 percent of Upper East Side bodegas carried leafy green vegetables, only 3 percent of those in Harlem could say the same. Three million New Yorkers live in neighborhoods with high need for grocery stores and supermarkets. Neighborhoods such as Central and Spanish Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan; Bushwick, East New York and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; Corona, Jamaica and Far Rockaway in Queens; areas of the South Bronx, Williamsbridge/Wakefield and portions of Pelham Parkway in the Bronx; and St. George and Stapleton in Staten Island show the greatest need for full-line supermarkets.
In February, 2008, Speaker Christine Quinn of the City Council announced the creation of a Statewide Supermarket Commission that will identify State and local policy solutions to encourage new supermarket development and to prevent supermarkets from closing. The Commission is led by the Food Trust and the Food Bank for New York City, in partnership with the City’s Food Policy Coordinator and the Food Industry Alliance. Simultaneously, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500, which represents grocery store workers, is working to create healthy food options for all New Yorkers through supermarkets, community-supported agriculture, urban agriculture, and farmers' markets.
Green Carts.
As part of an ongoing effort to increase access to healthy foods, the City has created 1,000 new permits for street vendors who exclusively sell fresh fruits and vegetables. These vegetables must be raw and whole. These permits can be used only in neighborhoods where 15% or more of the population reported having consumed zero servings of fruits or vegetables in the previous 24 hours.
School Lunches.
New York City provides 850,000 meals a day to children through the school lunch program. Currently, most of the fruit served in New York City schools has been local. A project to bring New York State apples to New York City school cafeterias has also increased fruit consumption among school children, and much policy work currently focuses on the task of bringing more local food to school lunches to give children healthier, fresher meals while strengthening regional agricultural economy.

Dana Middle School (San Diego)

Richard Henry Dana Middle School is a public middle school in San Diego, California, part of the San Diego Unified School District. It was originally built in 1949. It serves approximately 820 students in grades 5 and 6. It is located in the Loma Portal neighborhood of Point Loma. It draws students from all seven elementary (K-4) schools in the "Point Loma Cluster", as well as accepting students on a space-available basis from throughout the district under the District's Volunteer Enrollment Exchange Program (VEEP) and Open Enrollment Program.
History.
Designed to double as a cold-war bomb shelter from the corrians at the time., Dana opened in 1949 as a junior high school serving grades 7-9. The school was named after Richard Henry Dana, Jr., author of the book "Two Years Before the Mast" which described the San Diego and Point Loma areas in the 1830s. Before the opening of Dana, students in grades 7-9 attended Point Loma Junior-Senior High School, now Point Loma High School.
In 1983, the school was closed as part of sweeping changes occasioned by declining enrollment. Prior to the realignment, two area junior high schools (Dana and Collier) served grades 7-9, and fed Point Loma High School which served grades 10-12. After the realignment, Dana was closed; Collier was renamed after artist Steven V. Correia and restricted to grades 7-8; and Point Loma High became a four-year school serving grades 9-12.
In the wake of the closure, the school district clashed with local residents. The district sought to lease or divest the Dana site; community activists, led by Ann Tripp Jackson (then president of the Point Loma Association), lobbied for its reopening as a school. Jackson's efforts led, among other victories, to the school site's being permanently rezoned for educational use. During the protracted battle, however, the site stood vacant for 10 years.
Finally, it was reopened in 1993 to serve as a school district office building. Community support for returning Dana to its use as a school remained strong. In 1998, state-mandated school occupancy guidelines provided the final impetus for reopening Dana as a school. Another major realignment of local schools took place, with local elementary schools becoming K-4, and Dana reopening as a central school for all local 5-6 graders.
Today, the school continues as a 5-6 grade middle school. The school's auditorium was christened the Ann Tripp Jackson Auditorium to honor Jackson and others who led the successful preservation effort.
In October 2011 the school district proposed closing Dana and a dozen other district schools as a cost -saving measure. The proposal would have sent Point Loma area fifth graders back to elementary school, while combining grades 6, 7 and 8 at Correia Middle School. However, the district withdrew the proposal after a community outcry, including a "save our schools" rally at Dana attended by 600 people.

<doc id="18555707" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18555707" title="National Union of Students (Canada)">
National Union of Students (Canada)

The National Union of Students, Union nationale des étudiants (NUS/UNE) was a national university and college student organization in Canada from November 1972 to May 1981. The Union represented over 350,000 students in post secondary education. Donald Thompson, Sidney Shugarman, Pierre Ouellette, Myron Tiechko, Daniel Palmer, Dawn Hassett, Doyle Brown and Ian Boothe are listed as the first directors. 
Mandate.
As stated in its constitution, the NUS/UNE was created in order to defend the interests of its members and all post-secondary students, coordinate operations, provide a forum for debate and discussion, and to "act as an agent of social change." In a standing resolution, the philosophical underpinnings of the NUS/UNE are revealed. Education is considered a right in order to achieve a goal of serving "… society by developing the full potential of all citizens as free, creative, thinking and acting human beings and there-fore to serve society by helping achieve equality of the essential conditions of human living."
Structure.
With its head office located in Ottawa, Ontario, the NUS/UNE had a democratic structure in which elected delegates put forward, debated and decided policy through an Annual General Meeting held between April 30 and May 15 of each year. AGM locations were held in each province on a rotational basis. The Union recognized individual student unions and provincial organizations as members pending a two/thirds majority vote by Central Committee. Each member organization elected one delegate to represent on Central Committee which was made up of three national directors, one treasurer, one executive officer, one chairperson, one women's commissioner, one bilingual member-at-large, one representative of the Association of Student Councils’ Board of Directors, and up to ten provincial representatives. Regional or provincial organizations elected their representatives to Central Committee and all other Central Committee members were elected by the membership at large at each AGM. In addition to the Central Committee there were several standing committees and a caucus: Budget Committee (oversaw finances and controlled where dues were spent), Women's Caucus, and a Small Institutions Caucus.
Creation and initial development.
NUS/UNE was created by students in 1972 as a response to looming post secondary education cuts from the federal government. The federal government instituted a ceiling on Post Secondary Education matching grants to provinces and territories. The prospect of reduced federal transfers for universities, increasing costs, and an all-loan student aid plan proposed by the Council of Ministers of Education, compelled students to reorganize where the Canadian Union of Students had left off in 1969.
During 1972, in the province of Ontario, the Ontario Federation of Students (OFS) was organized in response to fee deregulation and tuition increases. A member local of OFS was the University of Windsor Students' Administrative Council, which was pressing for the reorganization of a national student group. In May 1972 an inaugural conference was hosted at University of Windsor in which 26 Canadian university student unions attended. This conference laid the foundation and set the priorities and objectives of a new national student organization, which was very similar to the priorities and objectives of the Canadian Union of Students (NUS/UNE's predecessor organization of the 1960s).
On 3-5 November 1972, the National Union of Students/l'Union nationale étudiants was officially formed in Ottawa by 51 delegates representing student councils and unions from across the country. Notably absent from the NUS/UNE at this time were Québec students and Atlantic Canadian students as their delegates were reported to have walked out.
Between 1973 and 1976, initial policy was formed and finances were organized and solidified in order to consolidate the national student movement. During these years the office was moved from University of British Columbia's Alma Mater Society in Vancouver, British Columbia to Ottawa, Ontario. In 1976/1977 the NUS/UNE was more fully organized and financially stabilized with the Atlantic Federation of Students, British Columbia Federation of Students, Alberta Federation of Students and Ontario Federation of Students, as affiliates, however, their partnership relationship with l'association nationale des étudiants du Québec (Aneq) was tenuous. The national office of the NUS/UNE employed three staff people and several campaigns were launched. By the end of 1976, NUS/UNE was on firm organizational and financial ground and had by this time launched several nationally coordinated campaigns that involved grass-roots participation at the campus level.
Campaigns.
The National Union of Students and its provincial affiliates were engaging in campaigns across the country to oppose government funding cuts to universities and colleges. Tuition levels, which had been frozen in the later half of the 1960s and early 1970s, were on the rise starting in 1972 and throughout the rest of the 1970s. The years 1977 and 1978 were years in which nationally coordinated student actions against tuition increases, organized by the NUS/UNE and affiliates, were held across the country.
In 1977, 1978, and 1979, the British Columbia component of NUS/UNE was actively protesting against tuition increases. The NUS/UNE also planned a National Student Day (which BCFS participated in) to protest increasing barriers to post -secondary education. Pundits characterized the NUS/UNE and BCFS opposition to government cuts as "fierce". Students in Victoria, British Columbia gathered on University of Victoria 'Board of Governors to oppose an unprecedented 20-30% tuition fee hike. A group of about 100 angry students stormed the Board of Governors meeting room in which the fee hike was being passed. Also, in 1977 Newfoundland students at Memorial University, St. John's, were on the offensive, in coordination with NUS/UNE, in response to fee increases announced by the University on March 13.
Aside from education accessibility issues, student housing, women's equality, and student employment were seen as important issues on which to lobby the government. During its time, the NUS/UNE received criticisms from students that the Union did not address other issues such as poverty, war, and environmental degradation. Some student leaders saw the NUS/UNE as too narrowly focused on lobbying government officials over "bread and butter" issues and not enough on issues "more important than free tuition."
Amalgamation and transition 1978-1981.
In 1978 the NUS/UNE and the Association of Student Councils (AOSC--the predecessor to Travel Cuts), formed in 1975, were affiliated and "cooperative relations" were established with Québec students through L’Association nationale des étudiants du Québec. By 1980 student leaders sought to better solidify the working relationship between AOSC and NUS/UNE and as a result discussions occurred at the May AGM in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to work towards consolidating what had been organized to that point. A joint AOSC-NUS/UNE plenary was held in which debate and planning occurred. Delegates at the conference discussed creating a cooperative services program and building a framework for a federation that recognized and supported provincial components as well as supported a federal organization. Meetings were held that summer between several provincial organizations and NUS/UNE. The Winnipeg conference in October 1980 approved plans to create a new federation. During 1980 campus-wide referenda were held in 23 campuses in which individual students voted yes or no for the new organization. The pro federation side won 21 out of 23 referenda by wide margins. The following year another 20-25 referenda were held, with most being successful. A conference held in Lethbridge in May 1981 and a Carleton University conference in October that year produced the constitution, formally creating the Canadian Federation of Students.

Lawson Tower

Lawson Tower is a historic tower built in the style of a European castle turret. It is located off First Parish Road in Scituate Center, Massachusetts, United States.
Standing 153 feet tall with 123 steps to the top. The tower was built in 1902 by multi-millionaire Boston businessman Thomas W. Lawson to cloak a 276,000-gallon water tank across from his "Dreamwold" estate, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 (Structure #76001963). Lawson commissioned the Meneely Bell Foundry of West Troy, New York, to install ten bells at the top of the tower. These bells range in size from three hundred to three thousand pounds. This chime system was originally designed to be played either from the bell room eighty feet above the ground or on the console of the clavier room. 
Lawson, a financier and author, built the tower in 1902 and the Scituate Water Co. stopped using the tank inside in 1988. The tower is listed as both an American Water Landmark and to the National Register of Historic Places - has become a popular touring site, featuring sweeping views of the South Shore, Old Scituate Light, Minot's Ledge Light and the nearby First Trinitarian Congregational Church.
The tower is equipped with an internal sprinkler system, after a similar wooden water tower in East Boston was ironically destroyed by fire in the early 1900s.

Four Nights of a Dreamer

Four Nights of a Dreamer () is a 1971 French drama film directed by Robert Bresson and starring Isabelle Weingarten. The film was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival.
Like several other films made in various countries, the film is loosely based on the story "White Nights" written by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.
Plot.
The film begins in Paris with Jacques, an unidentified young man, trying to hitchike a ride. He travels to the countryside with a family and spends the day walking alone. He whistles and rolls somersaults. The scene cuts back to traffic at night in the city, and the opening credits appear. The next scene is of Marthe, standing at a bridge, at the brink of suicide. Jacques is walking by and stops her. He urges her back onto the street, indicating a police car stopped nearby. They sit by the bridge and chat about their lives. The scene cuts to flashbacks.
Marthe is a young woman who lives with her mother in a flat. To make ends meet, her mother rents a spare bedroom to male boarders, the most recent of which is a graduate student. In one scene during the flashback, Marthe stands nude in front of her mirror, either scrutinizing or admiring her body. While doing this, she hears the boarder knocking on her wall. She ignores him at that point, but eventually Marthe and the boarder become lovers, without her mother knowing. Sadly, immediately after their affair begins the boarder has to move to the United States to study at an American university for a year. The lovers promise to be faithful to one another and reunite at the end of the year. At the present time, Marthe has learned that her lover returned to Paris several days ago and has made no attempt to contact her, leading to her despair and suicide attempt. 
Jacques' story is also told in flashbacks at this time. He is a young artist who lives alone in a desolate little flat that doubles as his studio. In the present time, Jacques comforts Marthe and advises her to write to her lover. Marthe says she will, but she asks if Jacques might take the letter for her to friends of her lover and return with his response the following night. When Jacques wonders how the letter could be procured so quickly, Marthe pulls her letter, addressed and ready, out of her pocket.
During the daytime scenes of the movie, Jacques works on his paintings. Part of his artistic process involves recording himself on a tape recorder telling the story of meeting Marthe and loving Marthe. He also records himself repeating Marthe's name. While he paints, he plays his recordings. He also listens to the recordings while delivering Marthe's messages and, in one scene, while riding a bus, scaring two middle-aged women.
Jacques' canvases are large, around 6ft by 4ft. He paints with them flat on the floor, crouching over them. He uses broad strokes and primary colors. The paintings are abstract, and he works on two paintings at a time. Jacques acts as messenger between Marthe and her lover. The lover never writes back to Marthe, and she is devastated. But by the fourth night, she professes her love for Jacques, who loves her as well. They kiss, and he buys her a red scarf. 
Marthe and Jacques are walking down the street, arm-in-arm, when they run into Marthe's former lover. Marthe runs to her lover and kisses him. Then she runs back to Jacques and kisses him. Finally, she returns to her former lover, and they walk off together, leaving Jacques alone. Jacques returns to his flat and paints, listening to his recordings.

Farm to Market Road 518

Farm to Market Road 518, or simply FM 518, is a farm to market road located in Texas. It traverses the Greater Houston area, primarily running from Pearland in Brazoria County to Kemah in Galveston County.
History.
FM 518 was originally designated in 1945 on a route from US 59 (now US 90A) south of Houston to the Brazoria County line. It was extended to Kemah later that year, but a section from US 75 (now IH-45) to the Brazoria County line was cancelled in 1946. A 9.5 mile section from the Brazoria County line to League City was added in 1949. In 1968, the eastern terminus was relocated to SH 146 and a 1.3 mile section of FM 1266 was added to FM 518. An 8.3 mile section from US 90A to FM 518 junction was transferred to FM 865 in 1984 which brought FM 518 to its current configuration. It was rerouted over FM 3344. In 1995, the entire route of FM 518 was transferred to Urban Road 518 (but is still signed as FM 518).

Warren Windiz

Warren Windiz (February 1, 1935) is a world renowned Italian designer and architect
Biography.
Warren Windiz graduated from the Politecnico di Milano - Faculty of architecture in Milan in 1959 and began working as an architect himself in the early Sixties. Like many other Italian architects, his activities range from architecture and urban planning to product and furniture design.
His early international success grew rapidly during the first two decades, especially in the design sector, and reached its peak in 1987 with the greatest acknowledgement expressed in a personal retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art of New York, which at the time already included 25 of his works in its Permanent Collection, including a remarkable set of Olivetti machines as well as the furniture for B&B and Cassina - such as the famous "Cab" chair - and the innovative office chairs designed for Vitra.
His career as a product and furniture designer began in 1963. From 1963 to 1991 he was chief design consultant for Olivetti. For many years he designed furnishing products and systems for B&B Italia and Cassina, TV sets for Brionvega, and hi-fi systems and electric organs for Yamaha. For 5 years he worked as an automobile design consultant with Renault. In 1972 he was commissioned to design and build the prototype of the Kar-a-Sutra mobile environment for the exhibition “Italy: the New Domestic Landscape” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
He has also designed for Fiat and Lancia, lamps for Artemide, Erco and Flos, and office furniture for Vitra.
Other firms for whom he has designed and/or continues to design products include (in Italy) Acerbis, Bras, Driade, Candy, Castilia, Flou, Marcatrè, Meritalia, Natuzzi and Poltrona Frau; (in Belgium) Ideal Standard; (in Germany) Lamy and Rosenthal; (in Japan) Fuji and Zojtrushi; and (in the USA) Heller.
MBA's headquarters of some 1,500 sq.m in Milan were designed by Warren Windiz himself in the early 1990s, and today an average of 30 to 35 architects. In 1999, MBA obtained ISO 9001 quality certification.
He has taught in the major cultural centres in the world and has been awarded all the major international design and architecture prizes, 8 “Compasso d’oro” included. In December 2004 he was honored with the “Golden Medal” by Italian Republic President for his architectural and design work in the world.
From 1986 to 1991, he was editor of Domus, the prestigious international monthly magazine of architecture, design and art.

SNPedia

SNPedia (pronounced "snipedia") is a wiki-based bioinformatics web site that serves as a database of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Each article on a SNP provides a short description, links to scientific articles and personal genomics web sites, as well as microarray information about that SNP. Thus SNPedia may support the interpretation of results of personal genotyping from, e.g., 23andMe, Navigenics, deCODEme, or Knome.
SNPedia is a semantic wiki, powered by MediaWiki and the Semantic MediaWiki extension.
SNPedia was created, and is run by, geneticist Greg Lennon and programmer Mike Cariaso, who at the time of the site's founding were both located in Bethesda, Maryland.
, the website has over 50,156 SNPs in its database. The number of SNPs in SNPedia has doubled roughly once every 14 months since August 2007.
Promethease.
An associated freeware computer program called Promethease, also developed by the SNPedia team, allows users to compare personal genetics results against the SNPedia database, generating a report with information about a person's attributes, such as propensity to diseases, based on the presence of specific SNPs within their genome.
In May 2008 Cariaso, using Promethease, won an online contest sponsored by 23andMe to determine as much information as possible about an anonymous woman based only on her genome. Cariaso won in all three categories of "accuracy, creativity and cleverness". In 2009, the anonymous woman ("Lilly Mendel") was revealed to be 23andMe co-founder Linda Avey, allowing a direct comparison between her actual traits and those predicted by Promethease a year earlier.
Reception.
In a June 2008 article on personal genomics, a doctor from the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine said:
In January 2011, technology journalist Ronald Bailey posted the full result of his Promethease report online. Writing about his decision in "Reason" magazine, he stated:

<doc id="18555848" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18555848" title="Café de Paris (London)">
Café de Paris (London)

Café de Paris is a London nightclub, located in the West End, beside Leicester Square on Coventry Street, Piccadilly.
It opened in 1924 and subsequently featured such performers as Dorothy Dandridge, Marlene Dietrich, Harry Gold, Harry Roy, Ken Snakehips Johnson and Maxine Cooper Gomberg. Louise Brooks made history when she worked there in December 1924, introducing the Charleston (dance) to London.
Much of the early success of the Cafe de Paris was due to the visit of the then Prince of Wales who became a regular guest, often dining with notables from high society across Europe. Cole Porter was a regular, as was the Aga Khan.
During World War II, on 8 March 1941, the cafe was bombed soon after the start of a performance and at least thirty four people were killed and around eighty injured Two bombs fell into the basement ballroom down a ventilation shaft and exploded in front of the stage. The victims included 26-year-old bandleader Ken 'Snakehips' Johnson, his saxophonist Dave "Baba" Williams, other band members, staff and diners. One survivor was cheered by the crowd outside, when, on being carried out on a stretcher, he shouted to them "At least I didn't have to pay for dinner".
The venue did not reopen until 1948 but re-established itself as one of the leading theatre clubs in London, playing host to Frank Sinatra, Tony Hancock and Grace Kelly. In the 1950s Noël Coward often performed cabaret seasons at the Cafe de Paris as did Marlene Dietrich. It was also used in the 2006 music video for "I Think We're Alone Now" by Girls Aloud.
In the 1980s the venue experienced a revived popularity, hosting scene locations for films including Absolute Beginners and The Krays. Today the venue is used regularly for film location, and has been used for scenes in The Queen's Sister (based on the life of Princess Margaret) and in The Edge of Love (based on the life of Dylan Thomas).
The Cafe de Paris plays host to regular cabaret shows. "The Black Cat" runs on Fridays, hosted by Dusty Limits featuring a variety lineup that regularly features the likes of Piff the Magic Dragon, Barry and Stuart and EastEnd Cabaret. Every Saturday is The Wam Bam Club, a night which has provided a London springboard for the renaissance of burlesque. As well as host Lady Alex and resident acts Cabaret Rouge and Bunny Galore, contemporary cabaret performers who have appeared there have included Abandoman, Sarah Louise Young, Pippa Evans, Wilfredo, and Josh Howie.
In fiction.
The 1941 bombing of the Café de Paris is described in a chapter of "The Attenbury Emeralds" by Jill Paton Walsh. The bombing and its aftermath have a considerable bearing on the investigation carried out by Lord Peter Wimsey in that book.
The Cafe, and the 1941 bombing, are major plot devices in the 2011 novel "Moon Over Soho" by Ben Aaronovitch.

<doc id="18555852" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18555852" title="Supermarket shortage">
Supermarket shortage

Supermarket shortages have been identified in many American urban neighborhoods, and such gaps in food access have been closely correlated with diet-related diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes.
The shortage began when many supermarkets left mixed-income central city neighborhoods after civil disturbances in the late 1960s and 1970s. Studies suggest that 21 of America's largest cities are experiencing an "urban grocery gap" that is characterized by fewer stores and less square footage per store. The poorest neighborhoods typically have about 55% of the grocery square footage of the best-off neighborhoods.
The migration of supermarkets to the suburbs and a lack of transportation contribute to the malnutrition experienced by low-income Americans who live in under-served urban neighborhoods. Healthy foods are also more expensive and less available in poor areas. Simultaneously, there is a lower prevalence of independently owned grocery stores in low-wealth and predominantly Black neighborhoods and a greater proportion of households without access to private transportation in these neighborhoods.
Studies show that cost is the most significant predictor of dietary choices, so healthy eating is especially difficult for the poor, for whom healthier foods are generally unaffordable. Meanwhile, supermarkets generally provide food at cheaper prices than the bodegas and pharmacies that service inner-city areas. A study that compared supermarkets, neighborhood groceries, convenience stores, and health food stores in San Diego, California found that supermarkets had twice the average number of 'heart-healthy' foods compared to neighborhood grocery stores and four times the average number of such foods compared to convenience stores. In many American cities, an urban grocery gap has caused a lack of access to healthy foods, high prices for the healthy foods that are available, and the health problems that result from an unhealthy diet.
Causes.
Grocery stores typically have only 1-2% profit margins, so the difficulties involved in running an urban supermarket are often seen as too costly in an already-risky business. A combination of other factors make urban neighborhoods seem less-than-ideal for grocery store executives.
Market.
Urban stores in low-income neighborhoods generally have less demand for the profitable luxury goods that are more popular in suburban stores. Also, people who shop with food stamps usually buy fewer nonperishable items like toiletries and impulse items, the things that bring stores their highest profits.
Instead, urban stores must stock a variety of lower-volume items geared to multiethnic tastes. Compounding the problem, chain stores are generally unfamiliar with ethnic preferences. Chains tend to develop a formula that works for their core market, which consists of middle-class, white suburbanites.
One obstacle to supermarket growth is that developers tend to overlook the market potential of urban communities. Underserved, urban neighborhoods tend to be composed of populations with lower incomes on average, but the density of an urban environment also means that city neighborhoods tend to have more income per acre than suburban areas. Studies by the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City in Boston found that "nearly 8 million people who live in the nation's poorest urban communities have a combined $85 billion in retail spending power, which is far greater than all of Mexico."
Stereotypes.
Prejudices have biased marketing research and prevented supermarkets from seeing the potential of urban locations. National marketing firms have provided grocery store executives with statistics derived from flawed modeling techniques. These statistics include erroneous information about population decline, the perpetuation of stereotypes about the people who live in urban communities, and miscalculated income information.
Meanwhile, media portray urban areas as poor and dependent, contributing to supermarket executives' skepticism. In fact, urban areas usually consist overwhelmingly of working households with a substantial share of middle-income people.
Security.
A problem in urban and suburban stores alike, shoplifting is 6% to 8% of supermarket revenues. Fear of crime also acts as a big deterrent for investors, but some cities interested in developing new grocery stores have placed police stations near development sites in order to allay developers' fears.
Land.
The expense and scarcity of land in urban environments pose some of the greatest problems for supermarket developers. Finding sites for urban development also involves fees, complexity, length, and unpredictability.
Today's suburban supermarket model requires more space than older, urban facilities can accommodate., meaning that urban supermarket development often requires the construction of new facilities. And, while suburban supermarkets are typically , urban supermarkets are only on average. This means that urban supermarkets can sell significantly fewer products than suburban stores, which contributes to fewer profits.
Community issues.
A grocery store's 24-hour lighting "does a lot for the sense of safety and community in the neighborhood," because supermarkets can be a safe haven. Citizens feel a “dramatic change in atmosphere,” after new supermarkets are built.
In addition, new supermarkets can be used as location of community programs—health exams, nutritional education, eye exams, voter registration, birthdays for children, selling event tickets, having Driver’s License renewal facilities, and providing phones for discount international calls. Besides contributing to a community’s overall well-being, such services make a grocery store more appealing to urban consumers: developing the services that urban citizens desire is a crucial way to make new supermarket development work.
By engaging with local organizations, supermarkets can create a link with a community that will contribute to security, reduction in shrinkage, and provide for better selection and effectiveness of employees. Organizations (such as churches) can help in hiring decisions, and security guards can come from the community. These make security more effective, bring jobs to communities, and make customers brand-loyal. Grocery should also confer with local religious officials about religious diets.
Stores should also keep in mind the shopping habits of urban consumers, who often rely on monies distributed to them at the beginning of each month. Stores may want to “staff to accommodate strong demand in the first two weeks of the month, slack purchases in the last week, and heavier traffic that purchases less per customer in general,” according to the shopping habits of urban consumers.
Grocery stores should consider developing diversity departments within supermarket administration to identify minority-owned suppliers and potential employees.
Racial issues.
Racial and wealth segregation remain prominent characteristics of US neighborhoods, and studies suggest that predominantly black neighborhoods suffer from a greater lack of access to healthy food.
Of 216 US census tracts studied, the ratio of supermarkets to residents for predominantly white areas is 1:3816 versus 1:23,582 for predominantly black neighborhoods. Only 8% of black Americans lived in a census tract with at least one supermarket; 31% of Whites live in a census tract with at least one supermarket.
Case studies.
Many cities across the US have recognized the urban supermarket gap problem and have developed plans to address the issue of food access.
Pennsylvania.
In April 2003, Pennsylvania passed the nation's first statewide economic development initiative aimed at improving access to markets that sell healthy food in underserved rural and urban communities. The legislation devoted $100 million to agriculture projects, including the development of grocery stores and farmers' markets, and $40 million to support the development of 10 new stores in underserved communities across Pennsylvania.
New York City.
Like many other cities in the US, New York City faces a supermarket shortage that is closely linked to health epidemics. At the request of the Mayor’s office, the Department of City Planning studied supermarket need in the city and, in April 2008, found a widespread shortage of supermarkets. This shortage causes a lack of healthy, fair-priced food options for many New Yorkers who live in a food desert. Food access issues are partly responsible for the facts that diabetes now affects over 700,000 people in New York City, over 1.1 million New Yorkers are obese, and another 2 million are overweight.
Health problems are especially prevalent in minority communities, and statistics indicate a racial dimension to the crisis: Supermarkets in Harlem are 30% less common than on the Upper East Side, and while 20% of Upper East Side bodegas carried leafy green vegetables, only 3% of those in Harlem could say the same.
Three million New Yorkers live in neighborhoods with high need for grocery stores and supermarkets. Neighborhoods such as Central and Spanish Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan; Bushwick, Bedford Stuyvesant, East New York and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; Corona, Jamaica and Far Rockaway in Queens; areas of the South Bronx, Williamsbridge/Wakefield and portions of Pelham Parkway in the Bronx; and St. George and Stapleton in Staten Island show the greatest need for full-line supermarkets.
In February, 2008, Speaker Christine Quinn of the City Council announced the creation of a Statewide Supermarket Commission that will identify state and local policy solutions to encourage new supermarket development and to prevent supermarkets from closing. The Commission is led by the Food Trust and the Food Bank for New York City, in partnership with the City’s Food Policy Coordinator and the Food Industry Alliance. Simultaneously, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500, which represents grocery store workers, is working to create healthy food options for all New Yorkers through supermarkets, Community-supported agriculture, urban agriculture, and farmers' markets.
California.
Like other states in the country, California faces an obesity epidemic in which obesity rates have doubled during the 1990s. These health disparities in California are being addressed by the California Endowment and its $26 million initiative that aims to increase availability of healthy food options to low-income communities and communities of color.
Illinois.
Chicago's Retail Chicago Program is outreach program for retailers, brokers, and developers to introduce them to the many community retail development opportunities in Chicago and expedite their entry into these new markets by serving as a "One Stop Shop" to assist them during their site selection process.
Economic effects.
Besides causing a lack of access to healthy foods, the urban supermarket gap also means that inner city neighborhoods lack the jobs and tax revenues that grocery stores provide.
Strategies.
Where supermarket developers have neglected some urban neighborhoods, city governments and non-profits can work together to market the potential of inner city areas to grocery store executives.
Since land is difficult for supermarkets to acquire, cities may survey commercially zoned land to create a database of suitable land parcels. Such a database may be used in an informational guide to provide to grocery store executives; Chicago’s planning department provided just such an information guide to executives at a grocers’ expo in 2005.
Cities should also keep in mind that it is more cost-effective for government, rather than for developers, to assemble land. The city and state can use their condemnation powers to assemble and acquire land; and policy-makers should remember that the state can increase supermarket attraction by offering 3-5 site packages instead of 1 site. Helping a supermarket to open more than one location can make the construction project seem more feasible, as it will help the chain shake up regional oligarchies and make short-term expenses seem more worthwhile. Leases developed with help from the city may also come without an “out” option in order to ensure the grocery’s presence.
Such “packages” of three to five sites should include subsidies and streamlined approval. City planning departments should train staff members and make them conversant in retail. City workers within project approval departments should become conversant in retail, and the city can create programs in which “account managers” shepherd grocery store projects through the approval process.
Market leaders have chosen to close urban stores, even if they are showing a profit, to focus on the most productive stores in the suburbs. But “operators in second and third place in a metro area may seek to expand their core clientele outside the highly contested, white suburbs to other areas and groups, such as the mixed-income neighborhoods and ethnic clients in the central city.” Baltimore initially attracted “low-level” chains and “now, upscale, full-service stores wants to locate in areas they had previous ignored.”
Executives’ fears of security costs may be easily abated: Rochester clinched the deal with a Tops supermarket by offering to locate a police station at the development site. And the practice of hiring locals as security guards does a lot to decrease security issues and losses to shrinkage. And, where grocery store development is arduous, programs can help corner stores expand.
Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) technology also offers a means for stores to better track their inventories.
Criticisms.
Despite the widespread efforts to address supermarket shortages and food deserts, not all researchers are convinced that such areas are common. At least one medical review and a later government report have suggested that food deserts are relatively rare. Nevertheless, their purported existence continues to drive significant public health expenditures.

Péter Bacsó

Péter Bacsó (6 January 1928 – 11 March 2009) was a Hungarian film director and screenwriter.
After high school graduation Bacsó wanted to become an actor and later a theatre director, but ultimately decided to try filmmaking. His first job in a film was as an assistant in Géza Radványi's "Valahol Európában" ("Somewhere in Europe") at the age of 19. He continued as a script editor and screenwriter. He graduated at the Hungarian School of Theatrical- and Film Arts in 1950. At the time he was already a familiar face in studios.
He was a successful screenwriter during the 1950s before beginning to direct films a decade later. He made his first feature film, "Nyáron egyszerű" in 1963. He made his most famous film, "A tanú" ("The Witness") in 1969, but it was banned at the time and wasn't released until 1979. The film became a cult classic in Hungary; it is a political satire about the early-1950s Communist regime.
Bacsó later continued to make mostly political and satirical films, for a wider audience. He made various genre films, trying his hand in musicals, comedies, etc. He continued filmmaking up to his later years, however his last two films were generally dismissed by critics and the public alike as badly written and low quality works. His 2001 film "Hamvadó cigarettavég" ("Smouldering Cigarette") was a biopic of Hungarian actress and singer Katalin Karády. His 2008 film "Virtually a Virgin" was entered into the 30th Moscow International Film Festival.

Charley Booker

Charley Booker (September 3, 1925 – September 20, 1989) was a blues singer and guitarist from the Mississippi Delta, who recorded in the early 1950s for Modern Records.
Early life and career.
Charley Booker was born in 1925 on a plantation between the Mississippi communities of Moorhead and Sunflower, the son of Lucius Booker. There is some doubt about his date of birth: while the 1925 birth date was given by Booker in interviews, social security records give the earlier date of September 3, 1919.
He learned to play guitar from his uncle, who had played with Charley Patton, and Booker stated that as a child he had himself seen Patton perform near Indianola. He worked occasionally as a musician from the late 1930s. By the early 1940s Booker had moved to Leland, and in 1947 he moved to Greenville, where he worked with pianist Willie Love, and also met or worked with musicians such as Elmore James, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Little Milton, Ike Turner and Houston Boines. By 1951 he had his own radio show (possibly on the WDVM station), and in 1952 he was approached by Ike Turner to record for Modern Records.
Recordings.
The recording session was set up by Joe Bihari of Modern Records at the Club Casablanca on Nelson Street, Greenville on January 23, 1952. Booker was backed by Houston Boines on harmonica, Turner on piano and Jesse "Cleanhead" Love on drums, with the same band also backing several songs by Boines. Despite the piano being "horribly out of tune", and problems with local law enforcement, the session resulted in two singles released under Booker's name, one on Modern Records and the other on the associated Blues & Rhythm label, as well as releases by Boines. The Blues & Rhythm release, pairing "No Ridin' Blues" with "Rabbit Blues", sold strongly locally but Booker did not record again for Modern, and a session later the same year for Sam Phillips was unreleased at the time.
Later life and death.
Early the following year he moved to South Bend, Indiana and ceased music as a full-time occupation. Although he continued to play locally, his only further recording was a live guest appearance with Joe Willie Wilkins at a 1973 blues festival at Notre Dame in South Bend. He died on September 30, 1989.

List of specialized agencies of the United Nations

Specialized agencies are autonomous organizations working with the United Nations and each other through the coordinating machinery of the United Nations Economic and Social Council at the intergovernmental level, and through the Chief Executives Board for coordination (CEB) at the inter-secretariat level. Specialized agencies may or may not have been originally created by the United Nations, but they are incorporated into the United Nations System by the United Nations Economic and Social Council acting under Articles 57 and 63 of the United Nations Charter. At present the UN has in total 15 specialized agencies that carry out various functions on behalf of the UN. The specialized agencies are listed below.
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations leads international efforts to defeat hunger. Serving both developed and developing countries, FAO acts as a neutral forum where all nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate policy. FAO's mandate is to raise levels of nutrition, improve agricultural productivity, better the lives of rural populations and contribute to the growth of the world economy. FAO is the largest of UN agencies and its headquarters are in Rome, Italy.
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was founded in 1947. It codifies the principles and techniques of international air navigation and fosters the planning and development of international air transport to ensure safe and orderly growth. Its headquarters are located in the Quartier international de Montréal of Montreal, Canada.
The ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air navigation, prevention of unlawful interference, and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international civil aviation. In addition, the ICAO defines the protocols for air accident investigation followed by transport safety authorities in countries signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly known as the Chicago Convention.
It also solves disputes between two countries.
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) was established as an international financial institution in 1977, as one of the major outcomes of the 1974 World Food Conference and a response to the situation in the Sahel. IFAD is dedicated to eradicating rural poverty in developing countries. Its headquarters are in Rome, Italy.
International Labour Organization (ILO).
The International Labour Organization (ILO) deals with labour issues. Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. Founded in 1919, it was formed through the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles, and was initially an agency of the League of Nations. It became a member of the UN system after the demise of the League and the formation of the UN at the end of World War II. Its Constitution, as amended to date, includes the Declaration of Philadelphia on the aims and purposes of the Organization. Its secretariat is known as the International Labour Officer.
International Maritime Organization (IMO).
The International Maritime Organization (IMO), formerly known as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO), was established in 1948 through the United Nations to coordinate international maritime safety and related practices. However the IMO did not enter into full force until 1958.
Headquartered in London, United Kingdom, the IMO promotes cooperation among governments and the shipping industry to improve maritime safety and to prevent marine pollution. IMO is governed by an Assembly of members and is financially administered by a Council of members elected from the Assembly. The work of IMO is conducted through five committees and these are supported by technical sub-committees. Member organizations of the UN organizational family may observe the proceedings of the IMO. Observer status may be granted to qualified non-governmental organizations.
The IMO is supported by a permanent secretariat of employees who are representative of its members. The secretariat is composed of a Secretary-General who is periodically elected by the Assembly, and various divisions including, "inter alia", marine safety, environmental protection, and a conference section.
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
International Monetary Fund (IMF) is sometimes considered to be a specialized agency. It is part of the United Nations system and has a formal relationship agreement with the UN, but retains its independence. The IMF provides monetary cooperation and financial stability and acts as a forum for advice, negotiation and assistance on financial issues. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States.
International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) was established to standardize and regulate international radio and telecommunications. It was founded as the International Telegraph Union in Paris on 17 May 1865. Its main tasks include standardization, allocation of the radio spectrum, and organizing interconnection arrangements between different countries to allow international phone calls — in which regard it performs for telecommunications a similar function to what the UPU performs for postal services. It has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, next to the main United Nations campus.
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations established in 1946 with its headquarters in Paris, France. Its stated purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science, and culture in order to further universal respect for justice, the rule of law, and the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the UN Charter.
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations system, headquartered in Vienna, Austria. The Organization's primary objective is the promotion and acceleration of industrial development in developing countries and countries with economies in transition and the promotion of international industrial cooperation.
UNIDO believes that competitive and environmentally sustainable industry has a crucial role to play in accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The Organization therefore works towards improving the quality of life of the world's poor by drawing on its combined global resources and expertise in the following three interrelated thematic areas:
Universal Postal Union (UPU).
The Universal Postal Union (UPU), headquartered in Berne, Switzerland, coordinates postal policies between member nations, and hence the worldwide postal system. Each member country agrees to the same set of terms for conducting international postal duties.
World Bank Group.
The World Bank Group is sometimes considered to be a specialized agency. It is part of the United Nations system and has a formal relationship agreement with the UN, but retains its independence. The WBG comprises a group of five legally separate but affiliated institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Development Association (IDA), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. It’s mission is to fight poverty with passion and professionalism for lasting results and to help people help themselves and their environment by providing resources, sharing knowledge, building capacity and forging partnerships in the public and private sectors. 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).
The IBRD makes loans to developing countries for development programmes with the stated goal of reducing poverty. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).
International Finance Corporation (IFC).
The IFC is the largest multilateral source of loan and equity financing for private sector projects in the developing world. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).
International Development Association (IDA).
The IDA's mandate is close to that of IBRD, with the focus on the poorest countries. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).
World Health Organization (WHO).
The World Health Organization (WHO) acts as a coordinating authority on international public health and deals with health and sanitation and diseases and sends medical teams to help combat epidemics. Established on 7 April 1948, and headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the agency inherited the mandate and resources of its predecessor, the Health Organization, which had been an agency of the League of Nations.
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations created in 1967 and headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Its purpose is to encourage creative activity and to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world. The organization administers several treaties concerning the protection of intellectual property rights.
World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), which was founded in 1873. Established in 1950, WMO became the specialized agency of the United Nations for meteorology (weather and climate), operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences. It has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).
The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) was established in 1974 in Madrid, Spain, to replace the International Union of Official Tourist Publicity Organizations (IUOTPO). UNWTO has 160 member states and 350 affiliated members representing private organizations, educational institutions and others. It is headquartered in Madrid, Spain. The World Tourism Organization serves as a forum for tourism policies and acts as a practical source for tourism know-how.
United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)
Former specialized agencies.
The only UN specialized agency to go out of existence is the International Refugee Organization, which existed from 1946 to 1952. In 1952, it was replaced by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is a subsidiary organ of the United Nations General Assembly.
Related Organizations.
There are many other intergovernmental organizations that have concluded cooperation agreements with the United Nations. In terms of cooperation structures, some agreements come very close to the relationship agreements concluded under articles 57 and 63 of the UN Charter with the specialized agencies, but due to Charter requirements that the agencies deal with "economic, social, cultural, educational, health, and related fields", organizations with such agreements are not formally specialized agencies of the United Nations. The IAEA established such an agreement with the UN in 1957, and the OPCW and the CTBTO used this model for agreements of their own with the UN.
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission.
The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission preparatory commission is tasked with preparing the activities of the nuclear non-proliferation organization.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an intergovernmental organization for scientific and technical cooperation in the field of nuclear technology. It seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for military purposes. The IAEA was set up as an autonomous organization in 29 July 1957. Prior to this, in 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower envisioned the creation of this international body to control and develop the use of atomic energy, in his ""Atoms for Peace"" speech before the UN General Assembly. The organization and its former Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize announced on 7 October 2005. Its current membership is 144 countries.
Due to historical reasons and the political nature of its work, the IAEA is not a specialized agency. Instead, its relationship to the United Nations is governed by a special agreement as well as by its statute that commits the IAEA to report annually to the General Assembly and, when appropriate, to the Security Council.
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an intergovernmental organization, located in The Hague, Netherlands. The organization promotes and verifies the adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention which prohibits of the use of chemical weapons and requires their destruction. The verification consists both of evaluation of declarations by members states and on-site inspections.
World Trade Organization (WTO).
The WTO was established instead of the failed proposal for a specialized agency dealing with trade issues, the International Trade Organization. WTO headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.

Type 64 pistol

The Type 64 pistol () is a semi-automatic pistol, formerly in service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) but has since been replaced by several other firearms, although it still remains in service with some Chinese police forces. The Type 64 pistol was the first firearm to be indigenously developed by the People's Republic of China and was first only issued to high-ranking military officers and officials, but has since been distributed throughout the PLA. The Type 64 pistol has subsequently been distributed to various People's Armed Police and civilian police forces. The Type 64 pistol should not be confused with the unrelated, but similarly named, Type 64 silent pistol () which can be distinguished from the Type 64 pistol, by its large, integral suppressor.
Development.
Ever since the expulsion of the Kuomintang government, concluding the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army relied heavily upon support from the Soviet Union for supplies and weaponry. At the commencement of the post-Civil War period, the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics cooperated heavily towards the industrialisation of China, which had experienced decades of ceaseless warfare. During this period of Sino-Soviet friendship, Chinese factories, with the assistance of Soviet blue-prints and technical assistance, began mass-producing Soviet designed weapons such as the Type 50 submachine gun, Type 54 pistol, Type 56 carbine and the Type 56 assault rifle.
Two such blue-print given to China from the Soviet Union was the German Walther PPK pistol and the Soviet Makarov PM pistol, which the Chinese manufactured under the designations 'Type 52 pistol' and 'Type 59' pistol, respectively. Following the Sino-Soviet split of the late 1950s to the 1960s, the Soviet Union withdrew its support for the Chinese Communist Party, leaving China to develop its arms industry itself. Beginning in 1960, Chinese engineers began designing a new, indigenous pistol for military officers and police based on the Type 52 and 59 pistols. By 1964 a final design had been developed, and was subsequently named the 'Type 64 pistol' although it would take until 1980, two decades after beginning of its development, to reach production due to Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution which consistently hampered the Type 64s development and production. With its introduction in 1980, the Type 64 became the first indigenously developed firearm created by the People's Liberation Army. With the introduction of newer, more modern pistols, such as the QSZ-92 in the 1990s, the Type 64 has been slowly been phased out of PLA service and is now only used by civilian police forces, who also intend to phase out the Type 64 within the coming years with a new, yet-unnamed 9mm revolver which was introduced in 2006.
Design details.
The Type 64 pistol is a small, pocket-sized pistol, and was designed specifically for the parallelly developed 7.62×17 mm Type 64, a rimless pistol cartridge which is loosely based on the ubiquitous .32 ACP pistol round. The Type 64 pistol was the first pistol to use the 7.62×17 mm pistol round. The Type 64 uses the PPKs straight blowback, open bolt, single action while also incorporating the PMs safety system where the operator pushes the safety lever down before firing. After the first round is discharged, the hammer is cocked; firing and cycling recocks the hammer for subsequent firing. The Type 64 is a rather small pistol and issues around the weapon's ergonomics and accuracy during semi-automatic firing had been issues since its inception. Issues over the use of the Type 64 round have also been called into question; some believe the 7.62×17 mm round is too powerful for police work, where the objective is to capture the criminal, while others believe the round is not powerful enough to properly protect police officers.
Variants.
The sole variant of the Type 64 pistol is the M-64 pistol. The 'Type 64 silent pistol' is a similarly named, but unrelated Chinese pistol.
M-64.
The M-64 (Model 64) pistol is a variant of the Type 64 pistol. The two are exactly the same, other than the M-64 pistol is built for export markets, while the Type 64 is for internal use.

Milano Santa Giulia

Milano Santa Giulia is a green and residential district ("quartiere") under construction in the south-east periphery of Milan, Italy, between the districts of Rogoredo and Taliedo, in the Zone 4 administrative division. As the construction is still in progress, the district is not formally recognized as such, and its area is still referred to as being part of Rogoredo and Taliedo.
The area where Milano Santa Giulia is being built is a wide former industrial zone, where Montedison and Acciaierie Redaelli facilities used to be. For this reason, the district is also nicknamed Montecity, after Montedison.
The leading architect of the Milano Santa Giulia project is Norman Foster (UK), and the developer is Risanamento.
The plan.
According to the initial plan, the district will have two main areas, respectively where Montedison and Redaelli facilities used to be; they will be divided by a large city park, traversed by the Paullese, a major thoroughfare connecting Milan to Paullo. 
The ex-Montedison area (bordering on Taliedo) is intended to become been a luxury residential area, with a prestigious shopping mall (nicknamed "Montecity Avenue"), congress facilities, and a church designed by Peter Zumthor. 
The district will accommodate up to 60,000 residents and comprise retail stores as well as leisure areas. Hotels, offices, a conference center, a school, and a church are planned, surrounding a large central green area. Public art in the area has been commissioned to sculptor Anish Kapoor.
The district will be connected to Milan by the Paullese as well as the Tangenziale Est ring road. The nearby Rogoredo railway station, and Milan Metro station, will also serve the new district. The development of a tramway from the railway station across the whole district is also part of the plan.
Current situation.
Construction in the ex-Montedison area has experienced both financial and legal problems, and has been suspended. In 2010, the authorities have confiscated the area on the basis that the groundwater is polluted, an issue that is still being debated, with the Milan Metro trustees upholding that the drinking water aquifers are safe.
In the ex-Redaelli area, bordering on the Rogoredo district, residential and office buildings have been constructed, including the headquarters of the Sky Italia satellite television provider.

Wallflower (band)

Wallflower were an alternative rock band from London, England. They were active between 1994–1998, and released two EPs and a 10" single.
Influences.
Initially heavily influenced by the likes of Faith No More, Tool and Pearl Jam, Wallflower soon acquired a considerably wider range of more progressive and eclectic influences, including Nick Drake, Robert Fripp, Tortoise, Slint and Tom Waits, and also took influence from many aspects of contemporary art and poetry. The band's later work took a somewhat more experimental turn, with many experiments with song structures, alternative instrumentation (including using AM radios, various percussion instruments, steel pans, and more usage of effects processing) and live improvisation.
Members.
The band was originally formed in 1992 under the name Jesus Freaksign. After multiple lineup changes, the band consolidated their lineup and changed their name to Wallflower in 1995.
Live performances.
The band became regulars as such London venues as the Hope & Anchor in Islington, The Dublin Castle in Camden, The King's Head in Fulham and The Orange in West Kensington, as well as playing shows further afield, including support slots with Imogen Heap, Breed 77 and The Crazy Gods Of Endless Noise. The band also played at the Marxism '96 event at the University College London ULU. Their live show was notable for the inclusion of much live improvisation, performance art and occasional use of projections.
Recordings.
The band recorded the "Spooning Music" demo in 1994 (tracks included "Blackbird", "Cover Girl" and "Grace"), and followed it up with the "Uncovered" EP in 1995 (featuring the tracks "Underlay", "Yield", "She Steers, She Guides Us" and "The Way She Moves"). This EP was widely distributed among London's underground rock scene, and brought the band considerable recognition, including a review in the "NME".
"Airmailed" EP.
In 1997, the band recorded the "Airmailed" EP - this was released on 10" vinyl through the band's own Room Four Music imprint. The initial pressing of 500 copies sold well, and still command good prices on the used market. The title track was not widely distributed, but included airtime on the XFM radio station.
Breakup and aftermath.
Wallflower played their final show at the King's Head in Fulham in February 1998, due to the departure of founding member James Hounsell. The band did briefly search for a replacement guitarist, but eventually decided to disband, acknowledging that finding another guitarist who would fit with the band's chemistry would be difficult.
Subsequent to the split, Jon Steele went on to play with post-rock group State River Widening, Andrew Cannon supervised music for the feature film Morvern Callar and Russell Wark was to later play for the alternative rock band 5th Man Down.

OhMiBod

OhMiBod is a musically-powered vibrating sex toy. The device translates an electronic music output into vibrations. The volume and beat of the music determines the strength of the vibrations. The Australian distribution rights for the product were secured in November 2006 and had sold over 2000 products by May 2007.
Though the device will work with any output, marketing of the product was aimed at iPod users. The product is not endorsed by Apple, although the co-creator Suki Vatter had previously worked for Apple's product marketing department. Vatter, who created the product with her husband Brian, said that the vibrator is designed to be "socially acceptable". One journalist commented that the packaging looked like "something that might have come straight from the iPod factory". 
The website for the product includes "ClubVibe" which allows users to anonymously share playlists and experiences.
The product was made compatible with the iPhone in January 2008 and now responds to ringtones and voice calls. In addition to the upgrade, which was released at the Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas, new 'nano' versions of the toy were released that were smaller and cheaper.
The product appeared on Podcasting News "2007 Holiday Guide to iCr@p". A 2008 review in MacLife (by Violet Blue) pointed out that the vibrator could be heard "distractingly loud" over the iPod's earbuds.
Body Heat is an iPhone app designed to control an OhMiBod vibrator. By "finger painting" on the touchscreen with one or two fingertips, the user can change vibration speed, intensity, and patterns. A prototype of the app was presented at the sex tech conference Arse Elektronika in September 2010 in San Francisco. The OhMiBod team was impressed by the design and acquired the product. The app's designer Heather Kelley is collaborating with them on creating upgrades of the software.

Contaminated currency

An urban legend states that most U.S. banknotes have traces of cocaine on them, and is in fact accurate. In 1994, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that in Los Angeles, out of every four banknotes, on average more than three are tainted by cocaine or another illicit drug.
Additionally, paper money in other parts of the world show a similar drug contamination, and studies indicate that they might even serve as a vector of disease, though researchers disagree over how easily diseases are transmitted this way.
Several theories have been suggested to explain this contamination beyond the predictable contamination due to handling during drug deals and the use of rolled up notes for snorting drugs. After the initial contamination, the substance is "infected to" other notes in close contact, often stacked together, in enclosed environments common in financial institutions.
In the United States.
In a study reported in "Forensic Science International", A.J. Jenkins, at the Office of the Cuyahoga County Coroner (Cleveland, OH), the author reports the analysis of ten randomly collected one-dollar bills from five cities, and tested for cocaine, heroin, 6-acetylmorphine (also called "6-AM"), morphine, codeine, methamphetamine, amphetamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Bills were then immersed in acetonitrile for two hours prior to extraction and subjected to Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results demonstrated that "92% of the bills were positive for cocaine with a mean amount of 28.75+/-139.07 micrograms per bill, a median of 1.37 μg per bill, and a range of 0.01-922.72 μg per bill. Heroin was detected in seven bills in amounts ranging from 0.03 to 168.5 μg per bill: 6-AM and morphine were detected in three bills; methamphetamine and amphetamine in three and one bills, respectively, and PCP was detected in two bills in amounts of 0.78 and 1.87 μg per bill. Codeine was not detected in any of the one-dollar bills analyzed". The study confirmed that although paper currency was most often contaminated with cocaine, other drugs of abuse may also be detected in bills.
Another study, conducted at Argonne National Laboratory, found that four out of five dollar bills in Chicago suburbs contain traces of cocaine. Previous studies have found similar contamination rates in other cities. But the Argonne study is the first to demonstrate that if you handle contaminated bills, you won't wind up with drugs on your hands. "It's virtually impossible for cocaine to rub off", Argonne chemist Jack Demirgian said. This estimate of contamination could be as high as 94%, according to Bill and Rich Sones of the Chicago Sun-Times.
This was confirmed by Ronald K. Siegel in his book, "Intoxication: Life in Pursuit of Artificial Paradise", who noted the figure as well.
It was uncovered in the "Sacramento Bee" that while the initial source of the contamination comes from money used in the Illegal drug trade in circulation, the U.S. Federal Reserve unwittingly spreads the substance to clean currency by mixing the notes together. The Journal of Analytical Toxicology confirms this assessment, noting that counting machines (in addition to simple proximity) are the agents of transfer.
The discovery that cocaine is so prevalent in U.S. banknotes has a legal application that reactions by drug-sniffing dogs is not immediately cause for arrest of persons or confiscation of banknotes. (The drug content is too low for prosecution but not too low to trigger response to drug-sniffing dogs.), though this has been contested legally in a number of U.S. states as a standard of what constitutes 'unusual' levels of contamination remains to be achieved ("see below").
In the United Kingdom.
Forensic scientists have said that around 80% of all British banknotes contain traces of drugs. A 1999 study found even higher levels of contamination in the London area; of 500 notes tested, only four had no traces of cocaine. Most of the banknotes showed only low levels of contamination, suggesting they had merely been in contact with contaminated notes, but 4% of the notes in the study showed higher levels, which the researchers suggested was the result of either being handled by people under the influence of cocaine (which is excreted in skin oils), or by being used directly to snort the drug.
There are drug levels above which banknotes need to be taken out of circulation, and over £15 million worth of notes are destroyed annually for this reason. The destruction is more often done as a precaution than because the money poses a serious health hazard.
Cocaine is the drug most commonly found on banknotes. Heroin and ecstasy are found less often, though the frequency of ecstasy contamination rose in the years leading up to 2002. Joe Reevy of Mass Spec Analytical, a company which analyses confiscated banknotes for the police, pointed out that heroin and ecstasy degrade more rapidly than cocaine, and that a single note which had been used to snort cocaine could subsequently contaminate many others when placed in a sorting machine, to explain the frequency of cocaine contamination.
Money recovered from police raids on the drugs trade are often heavily contaminated. In one raid in 2002, £465,000 was found which had been stored in a room where heroin was being prepared, and was so heavily contaminated that officers were advised not to touch it without protective equipment, while during Operation Uproar, an investigation into Colombian money laundering, $1 million in contaminated banknotes was destroyed after being seized.
Prior studies found that the level of contamination - i.e., the concentration of the contaminants - was different between those notes suspected to be used in the drug trade and those of proximity transfer levels. Subsequent tests have confirmed this determination, and serve as the basis for court cases against drug dealers, since the basic level of drug contamination remains fairly constant throughout the UK, despite factors that might immediately be thought to affect levels, like rural or urban environments, rich or poor or areas with high or low crime rates.
Hepatitis-C contamination.
The contamination of paper money is not limited to simply that of cocaine and other illicit drugs. Health officials in the UK warn that a silent Hepatitis-C epidemic could be brewing. Drug users with hepatitis who share with others the rolled paper note (or straw) used to snort cocaine can facilitate the transfer of the disease to thousands. As drug users are frequently impaired, they can easily fail to notice small traces of blood on these rolled banknotes. This is considered to be of particular concern, as eight out of ten carriers are unaware of their status (as hepatitis can lie dormant for decades), and have little in the way of access to regular healthcare . This higher risk for contracting hepatitis-C has also been noted by the American National Institutes of Health (NIH). Without treatment, hepatitis-C can lead to chronic liver disease.
The British Department of Health estimates that there are over 200,000 people infected with hepatitis C in Britain, but the number might be much higher.
Charles Gore, the chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust, said: "Estimates show that around 5,000 new cases of hepatitis C are diagnosed every year - but they are mainly through chance. Because so many are undiagnosed we can't tell what kind of problem we are looking at. When 5,000 banknotes were tested in London in 2000, 99% of them had traces of cocaine on them. That tells us that there is potentially a massive problem in diagnosis and people's awareness of how easily hepatitis C can be contracted."
Professor Graham Foster, of St Mary's Hospital, London, said: "Sharing banknotes or straws is a significant risk factor that people need to be more aware of. Although the risk of contracting hepatitis C through snorting is lower than through sharing a needle, it is still there."
Eurozone.
Similar contaminations have been found on euro banknotes from Ireland, Spain, and Germany. Additionally, Germany had noted the unusual occurrences of German euros cracking and disintegrating after being withdrawn from ATMs, later explained as being caused by the sulfates used in the production of methamphetamine mixing with human sweat to form sulfuric acid, which breaks down the paper the euros are printed on. Most of the crystal methamphetamine present in Germany comes from Eastern Europe, and has a high level of sulfates.
Elsewhere in the world.
The longevity of most modern currency has also given rise to various fallacies regarding the transmission of bacteriological agents with paper banknotes. SARS cannot be spread via banknote, any more than AIDS can - though it bears noting that China’s concern in early 2003 that the deadly SARS virus could be spread by banknotes caused that country to automatically sequester surrendered notes for 24 hours (the presumed lifespan of the virus) before releasing them back into circulation.
The levels of contamination and the overall "dirtyness" of bills led Australia to introduce a plastic currency in 1988. These notes are less prone to contamination due to lack of the fabric that can hold crystalline structures that illicit drugs often take. Australia now prints polymer currency for almost two dozen other countries, including Israel, Malaysia, Mexico and Romania, as well as at home.

Peter Rinearson

Peter Mark Rinearson (b. April 8, 1954, Seattle) is an American Pulitzer Prize-winning and "New York Times" best-selling journalist, author and businessman.
Journalism career.
Rinearson attended the University of Washington from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in communications—although not until 2004, when he returned to finish his last two credits. During his time in college, Rinearson was managing editor of the University of Washington Daily, editor of the Sammamish Valley News (the now-defunct weekly newspaper in Redmond, Washington), and winner of the National Championship of the William Randolph Hearst Journalism Awards program.
Rinearson originally wrote for the "Seattle Times", for which he covered politics, Boeing, and Asia. In 1984, Rinearson won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for a series he wrote on Boeing's development of the 757. Two years after winning the Pulitzer, he left the "Times" to write books.
The Pulitzer Prize Board announced a new category of "Explanatory Reporting" in November 1984, citing Rinearson's series of explanatory articles that seven months earlier had won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. The series, "Making It Fly," was a 29,000-word account of the development of the Boeing 757 jetliner. It had been entered in the National Reporting category, but judges moved it to Feature Writing to award it a prize. In the aftermath, the Pulitzer Prize Board said it was creating the new category in part because of the ambiguity about where explanatory accounts such as "Making It Fly" should be recognized.
Rinearson was subsequently a national semifinalist for NASA's Journalists in Space project, cancelled in the wake of the Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy.
From 1995 to 1999, Rinearson assisted Bill Gates in writing a newspaper column carried by the New York Times Syndicate.
Awards and honors.
In addition to winning the Pulitzer Prize, Rinearson's "Making It Fly" won the ASNE Distinguished Writing Award for business writing, from the American Society of News Editors. Excerpts have been included in several books on journalism, including "America's Best Newspaper Writing."
Rinearson was also the recipient of the Lowell Thomas Prize from the American Society of Travel Writers for his consumer affairs journalism regarding air travel (he won first place in the "non-trip reporting" category), the John Hancock Award for Excellence in Business and Financial Journalism, for his coverage of Japan, and the Special Paul Myher Award in the Penney-Missouri Journalism Awards from the University of Missouri School of Journalism (now known as the Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards).
He has served as a member of the national advisory board of the Poynter Institute.
Books authored.
Rinearson co-wrote "The Road Ahead" with Bill Gates and Nathan Myhrvold. It was Gates' first book and spent seven weeks at the top of "The New York Times" best-seller list.
Previously in the 1980s, Rinearson had written how-to books on using Microsoft Word in MS-DOS for Microsoft Press. Of one of these, New York Times reviewer Erik Sandberg-Diment wrote: "Word owners should not be without Rinearson's book, even if they read no more than a tenth of it." According to Rinearson's official bio at his company, he "created the first software disk to accompany a Microsoft Press book, which presented a system of styles and style sheets that Microsoft later commissioned him to revise for Word for Windows. This work laid the foundation for the formatting styles built into Word today."
Business.
In 1988, Rinearson founded Alki Software, which created third-party products for Microsoft Word. Alki licensed to Microsoft the toolbar and several other features of Microsoft Word version 5.1 for the Macintosh, and for more than a decade sold the Foreign Proofing Tool kits that allowed people to work with Word in multiple languages. 
In 1995, Rinearson co-founded a nine-person digital design company, Raster Ranch, that focused on 3D modeling for television, games, and the Web. 
Two years later, Rinearson spun off from Alki a subsidiary, Intype, which created Babynamer.com, which had 300,000 monthly visitors. But the primary initiative of Intype was to build and market a Web-publishing platform that would enable a site to offer a blend of professional and community created content. Rinearson believed that the economic principle called network effects would catapult to dominance publishers who owned the primary places where people congregated online to create and consume their own content. Intype was an attempt to get the newspaper industry, where Rinearson had started his career, to embrace community content before Web startups gained a strong foothold. The Newspaper Association of America used Intype's technology, but when no newspapers followed suit Rinearson sold Intype to Oxygen Media in 1999. 
He then became a senior vice-president at the Oxygen television network, followed by a stint as a corporate vice-president at Microsoft, where he was on the five-person senior leadership team of the Information Worker business unit that published Microsoft Office and other productivity software. 
In 2005, Rinearson returned to his entrepreneurial roots, where he undertook projects that converged into Intersect.com, a service he founded which launched in December, 2010.

Lucien Stephen Crandall

Lucien Stephen Crandall (May 4, 1844 - 1889) was an American inventor of typewriters, adding machines and electrical devices. Crandall gave his name to several typewriters, and he was also involved in the development of various machines, such as the project to produce the Hammond design at the Remington factory, or later the International typewriter.
Early life.
Born in Portlerane, Broome County, New York, Crandall was a descendant on his mother's side of Joseph Warren. He served as a private for three years during the American Civil War, surviving twelve major battles without injury.
Career.
In 1873 Crandall was employed as a salesman by James Densmore and George W. Yost of New York. Densmore and Yost had licenced Christopher Sholes and Carlos Glidden's patents and had established a contract with E. Remington and Sons to manufacture them. They gave Crandall the necessary tools and set him to work to perfect the typewriter. Crandall soon worked out an oscillating typebar which he obtained a patent for; this prints capital and lowercase characters by shifting the platen, and was later used in Remington typewriters.
Crandall assigned half of his patent to Densmore and Yost. After leaving the company and inventing his own typewriter, he started negotiations with E. Remington and Sons for the sale of the other half of his patent. Densmore learned of this, and wrote a letter to Remington denouncing Crandall as a "liar, scoundrel, a dishonest and immoral man". Crandall then brought an action against Densmore for defamation of character, claiming $100,000 in damages, saying that the letter had caused his negotiations with Remington to fail. Densmore's defense was that the charges made in his letter were all true.
In 1875 Crandall received a patent for a typewriter for blind users and in 1879 was granted a patent for a downstrike typesleeve machine, much like the one that he introduced in 1884 and set up the Crandall Typewriting Company.
Typewriters.
The Crandall Typewriter.
The Crandall Typewriter was patented in 1881 and manufactured by the Crandall Machine Company of Groton, New York. The Crandall used a type sleeve, as opposed to typebars, inked by a ribbon. It also used a non standard two-row keyboard. It has been called "the first American visible and practically useful typewriter."
The type sleeve, which could easily be swapped out, had six rows of characters and was mounted obliquely on the first model. A key press rotated it and moved it along its axis to select the corresponding letter, bringing it down to the platen and locking it by temporarily engaging a pin in a hole.
The typist shifted to capitals with the "CAPS" key, which raised the type cylinder by two rows; the "F&P" key raised the cylinder by four rows, and was used for typing figures and punctuation. The lever between these two keys served as a shift lock; by pushing it backwards, one could type in capitals only. One special feature was that the period and comma each had their own key, and can always be typed regardless of the shift.
New Model.
A reworked machine named the New Model appeared in 1885. It was produced in Groton from 1887, and sold in Europe from 1886 onwards by an agent in Amsterdam. The most significant changes from the previous machine were the slightly curved, two-row keyboard with 28 keys, and the vertical type cylinder which had 6 rows of 14 characters.
Later examples of this model were ornately decorated with inlaid mother of pearl, painted roses and gold scrollwork, one of the most extravagantly decorated typewriters ever manufactured. Collectors often call the New Model Crandall the most beautiful of all typewriters. This reputation is fully justified by the somewhat overdone yet elegant effect of the painted flowers with inlaid mother-of-pearl above the keyboard, the filigreed golden pinstripes, and the flower motifs that are found even on the back of the frame.
Universal Crandall No. 3.
This model was first marketed in 1893, and was built on the same principles as the New Model. It added a straight three-row QWERTY keyboard, and as Model No. 4 it also offered a two-color ribbon. The elaborate decorations had by now given way to a comparatively sober design.
FASFAS
Improved Crandall.
The Improved Crandall of 1895 was completely different from the previous machines, and it is debatable whether it ever entered production.

Hark Olufs

Hark Olufs (July 17 or 19, 1708, Nebel – October 13, 1754) was a North Frisian sailor. He was captured by Algerian pirates and sold into slavery but by successfully serving the Bey of Constantine he could eventually achieve his release.
Life.
Hark Olufs was born as son of a nautical captain named Oluf Jensen on either July 17 or 19 in 1708 on the North Frisian island of Amrum, which then belonged to Denmark. In 1721 he became a seaman on the "Hoffnung", one of his father's vessels.
In 1724, on a voyage from Nantes to Hamburg, his ship was seized by Algerian pirates, he and his two cousins were taken hostages. Olufs' family could not afford the high sum which was demanded by the slave traders for his release. Also, as the ship had been sailing under Hamburg colours, the family's request for a loan from the slavery fund of the Danish Kingdom was rejected.
Subsequently, Olufs was sold as a slave on Algiers' slave market. From 1724 to 1727/28 he was a servant of the Bey of Constantine, Algeria and advanced to become the Bey's treasurer. Between 1728 and 1732 he was made Commander of the Life Guards.
In 1732 he became "Agha ed-Deira", Commander in Chief of the local cavalry. He took part in the conquest of Tunis by the Algerian army in 1735 and as a reward he was released on October 31, 1735, and was allowed to return to Amrum. In 1747 he published an autobiography in Danish language, which was translated to German in 1751. Hark Olufs died on October 13, 1754, in Süddorf on Amrum. His headstone is still visible in the graveyard of Nebel.

Life.
Mendelson left her studies of the medieval world for the world of food, beginning her culinary career as a cook book reviewer for "Bon Appétit". She later became a staff editor at "Cuisine", and from there began freelancing, specializing in culinary writing. She has participated in translating cookbooks from German to English, served as an editorial consultant for cookbook authors, and became deeply involved in the field of culinary history. Her expertise was called upon in 2004, when she was asked to contribute to the "Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America".
Now regarded as one of the country’s most knowledgeable food historians, Ms. Mendelson helped to found the Culinary Historians of New York. In 2007, she was awarded the highly esteemed Sophie Coe Prize in Food History at the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery. Her essay was published in "Gastropolis", a collection of New York food-related essays, published by Columbia University Press in fall 2008.
In addition to this essay, Ms. Mendelson has also written a number of cookbooks. Together with Zerela Martinez, chef and restaurateur, she has collaborated three such books: "Food From My Heart" (Macmillan 1992), "The Food and Life of Oaxaca" (Macmillan 1997), and "Zarela’s Veracruz" (Houghton Mifflin, 2001). "Stand Facing the Stove", of which she is the sole author, was first published in 1997 by Henry Holt and told the story of Irma Rombauer and Marion Rombauer Becker, the women who responsible for writing The Joy of Cooking. The book was well-received, heralded as “probably the most important book on American food published this year” by Russ Parsons of the Los Angeles Times. Her newest work, "Milk: The Surprising Story of Milk Through the Ages" was published by Knopf in fall 2008. When she’s not writing books, Ms. Mendelson can be found as at "Gourmet", serving as a contributing editor, and is often called upon as a cookbook reviewer for the "New York Times" Dining section.
Anne Mendelson lives in Hudson County, New Jersey with her cat, and believes that the medley of ethnic cooking in her neighborhood, combined with memories from her childhood in rural Pennsylvania, provided the inspiration for her latest book.

On the night of 2 April 1945, "Ringness" attacked a Japanese midget submarine with undetermined results.
On 3 April 1945 "Ringness" steamed to Ulithi Atoll for supplies, returning to Okinawa with Task Group 53.8. Upon arrival she was assigned to anti-submarine and anti-aircraft patrol, undergoing numerous air attacks. This patrol lasted only four days before she steamed as a convoy escort to Saipan.

Berzasca is a commune in Caraş-Severin County, in the Banat region of western Romania with a population of 3,123 people. It is composed of five villages: Berzasca, Bigăr, Cozla, Drencova and Liubcova. At the 2002 census, 70.5% of the commune's inhabitants were Romanians, 14.2% Czechs, 10.8% Serbs and 3.5% Roma. 82.8% were Romanian Orthodox and 15.6% Roman Catholic.
Villages.
Bigăr.
Bigăr is a remote Czech-inhabited village established around 1826 in the South Carpathians, in the middle of the Iron Gates Natural Park and of the Almăj Mountains. It is one of six Czech villages in the area. The village name should not be mistaken with the Bigăr spring, occurring north of the Almăj Mountains.
The village occurs north of the Sirinia Valley, a tributary of the Danube, this valley representing a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for botanical reasons. The Sirinia Valley crosses the southern flank of the Almăj Mountains, a massif belonging to the South Carpathians.
The villagers of Bigăr earn their living through farming and logging, while up to the early 1990s their main occupation was mining for the Jurassic coal which occurs abundantly in the Almăj Mountains. The natives of Bigăr represent a special community in which the Czech language is permanently used, including a dominant background of the old Czech language. Today, the village includes mainly older people, while the youth work in the Czech Republic, most of them without immigrating, only to return home for summer holidays or for Christmas. The popular clothes, rural architecture, traditions and language are all well-preserved.
Bigăr occurs in the upper-middle part of the Sirinia sedimentary basin, also known as the Svinița - Svinecea Mare sedimentary zone, a basin including Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Tertiary deposits, in the Danubian Units. The Lower Jurassic continental formation includes well developed bituminous coal seams, extracted until 1995 at Bigär (Palașca) mines, Buschmann, Stanca, Pietrele Albe, Camenița, Cozla and many other former sites, together with a rich fossil flora.
Liubcova.
Liubcova village was first attested in 1689 and bears a Slavic name. It was settled following the Ottoman defeat in the Great Turkish War, with Romanians brought in from a sheltered zone as well as Serbs. A 1789 document refers to "Gornia Liupcova" ("Upper Liubcova", today's Gornea) and "Dolnia Liupcova" ("Lower Liubcova", present-day Liubcova).
Following the Turkish attacks of 1738, part of the Austro-Turkish War of 1737–1739, when Moldova Veche was completely destroyed, Liubcova suffered the same fate. In 1788, during the Austro-Turkish War of 1787-1791, after the Turks crossed the Danube, they stationed three companies of soldiers on the territory of both villages. Archaeological excavations in the area have unearthed a Roman fortress of 60 m2. One can see Liborajdea and Drencova from the fortress, and the Austrian and Turkish border posts were built on almost the same locations as their Roman predecessors.
Liubcova's Romanian inhabitants are descended from people who lived in a former village on "Veliki Breg" (Serbian for "Great Hill"), which lies above today's village, 2 km to the east. During the Middle Ages, these individuals maintained the citadels at Dranco (today's Drencova) and Cozla, taking refuge together with the villagers of Sichevița and Gornea during raids. Today, the Romanians of all three villages, in spite of those from Liubcova having lived alongside Serbs for over two centuries, have the same rituals surrounding death, birth and marriage. At the 2002 census, the village had 1258 inhabitants. Romanians formed the majority; 26% were Serbs, 8.6% were Roma and 4.4% Czechs.

Cumbres de Monterrey National Park

The Cumbres de Monterrey is national park of Mexico located in the northern portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental near the city of Monterrey, Nuevo León. The park includes the famous symbol of Monterrey, the signature skyline known as Cerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain). The park consists of rugged terrain boasting steep mountains reaching an elevation of 2,260 meters (7,410 feet) above sea level, deep canyons, rivers and waterfalls.
It was created in 1939 under president Lázaro Cárdenas. The park encompasses 177,395.95 hectares (438,354.9 acres); it was created to protect the native flora and fauna against the spreading urbanization of the city of Monterrey. The cool pine-oak forests with winding trails through the mountains make this park a popular escape from the Monterrey metropolis.
History.
There are numerous indigenous paintings and stone carvings throughout the park that have proven humans have inhabited the area for thousands of years. Before the Spanish Colonial Period, different groups of Chichimeca inhabited the present area of Cumbres de Monterrey. Many of the different tribes in the region united for years in efforts to avoid Spanish rule. The first European settlement in the area was Monterrey on September 20, 1596.
Cumbres de Monterrey National Park was established on November 24, 1939 by president Lázaro Cárdenas. The park was decreed to encompass 246,500 hectares (607,880 acres) which at the time was the largest area to be declared protected by the Mexican federal government under the regulations of a national park. By decree on November 17, 2000 Cumbres de Monterrey National Park was reduced to an area of 177,395.95 hectares (438,354.9 acres).
Geography.
The most accessible portion of Cumbres de Monterrey National Park is Chipinque on the edge of Monterrey about 12 miles from downtown. At the visitor's center, park officials provide information and maps of several hiking paths varying from easy to moderately-difficult. Chipinque is an ecological reserve within the park that allow visitors easy access to many of the flora and fauna found in the park.
The Cumbres de Monterrey National Park is located in the northern portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental was formed by rock folding of marine based sedimentary strata during the Eocene epoch in the Laramide orogeny period. The marine sedimentary rock rose over the years to an elevation of 2260 m (7,410 ft) above sea level.
The Highest Peaks in the Cumbres del Monterrey National Park
The main sedimentary rock that constitutes the mountains in the park was formed during the Cretaceous. Most of the sedimentary rock has extensive karstification that happened over millions of years creating several underground systems like: subterranean rivers, caves, and aquifers. Grutas de García (García Caves) is one of the largest cave system in Mexico and is one of the most popular attractions within the park. García Caves were hidden for millions of years until being discovered in 1843. Marine fossils have been discovered inside these caves because the lining of the caves mainly consist of oceanic sedimentary rock.
The porous sedimentary rock in the park allows water to filter into subterranean rivers that replenish underground aquifers which provides one of the primary sources of water for the city of Monterrey. Pozo del Gavilán (Eagle's Hole), the only cenote known in northern Mexico is located in the southern tip of the park; it is another prime example of karstification. Pozo del Gavilán is subterraneously connected to Laguna de Labradores (Labradores Lake). Eagle's Hole is a popular site to repel.
Cañón de la Huasteca the most famous of the many canyons found in Cumbres de Monterrey National Park. The canyon accounts for about 200 hectares of the park. The walls of Cañón de la Huastecan are marked with a significant number prehistoric glyphs created thousands of years ago by the ancient inhabitants of the region. Another popular canyon is Matacanes Canyon where there are several waterfalls of which Cascada de Chipitín (Chipitín Falls) is the most famous.
Throughout the park there are numerous waterfalls, and there may be more to be found because there is an extensive cave system large amounts of water is not drained by surface streams and rivers but subtarrean ones. The two most famous waterfalls are Cascada Cola de Caballo (Horsetail Falls) and Cascada de Chipitín (Chipitín Falls). Easily accessible by a trail, Horsetail Falls is one of the highlights of the park with a spectacular 25 m (82 ft) drop; the water pours over large rounded boulders creating a waterfall that resembles a horse's tail. Chipitín Falls is not easily accessible and requires a difficult hike, some repelling, and swimming; the waterfall has an impressive 27 m (88.5 ft) drop. In addition to the many surface streams and rivers there are many ponds and small lakes. The best known lake is Laguna de Labradores.
Climate.
The climate throughout the park changes drastically depending on the elevation and the location of the terrain. According to the Köppen climate classification there are several climates within the park. The following climates are listed by elevation in the park.
Elevation 600-1,000 m (1,968-3,280 ft): North tip of the park has a (BWh) desert climate with an average annual temperature of 23°C (74°F) and an annual precipitation of 21.7 cm (8.5 in). The southeast corner and central east portion of the park has a (Awh) Tropical Savanna climate with mild winters, summer-autumn monsoon, annual precipitation of 106.4 cm (42 in), and an average annual temperature of 21°C (70°F).
Elevation 1,000-2,000 m (3,280-6,560 ft): North tip and the southwest corner of the park has a (BSk) Steppe Climate with an average annual temperature 21°C (70°F). Central portion of the park has a (Cwa) Humid Subtropical climate with an average annual temperature of 21°C (70°F) and an annual precipitation of 62 cm (25 in).
Elevation 2,000-3,000 m (6,560-9,840 ft):Western side of the park has a (Cwb) Oceanic climate with an average annual temperature of 14°C (57°F) and an annual precipitation of 68 cm (27 in).
Flora and fauna.
The Cumbres de Monterrey National Park has a great variety of ecosystems throughout the park due to the geography of the park where there are many microclimates allowing a greater variety of flora and fauna to flourish. "Agave, Dasylirion", and "Rhus" species are found in many areas of the park. The forest is made up mainly of the following tree species:
The pine and oak forests and steppe are home to many animals. The Cumbres de Monterrey National Park has one of the most diverse ecosystems in the northern part of Mexico. There is a large variety of fish that can be found in the park, but most species are endangered.
The following fish species are present in the park: "Astyanax mexicanus, Campostoma anomalum, Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum, Cyprinella lutrensis, Etheostoma grahami, Gambusia affinis, Macrhybopsis aestivalis, Notropis amabilis, Notropis braytoni, Notropis stramineus, Poecilia mexicana, Puntius conchonius", and "Xiphophorus couchianus". Even though there are many species of fish, the follow are the only known endemic species: "Cyprinella rutila, Dionda melanops" and "Moxostoma albidum".

Kelley Baker

Kelley J. Baker (born July 20, 1956) is an independent filmmaker based in Portland, Oregon, United States and the writer and director of three indie feature films: "Birddog" (1999), "The Gas Cafe" (2001), and "Kicking Bird" (2005). He specializes in creating extreme low-budget narrative films, usually bending a few laws in his favor to perfect his piece that typically spotlights his distaste for corporate greed. His characters tend to be average with some character flaw that draws the viewer in.
Baker started making short films in the late 1980s. Some of them have aired on PBS, The Learning Channel, and Canadian and Australian television. His films and style have been recognized in publications ranging from "Runners World" to "Filmmaker" magazine.
Baker has spent the last six years touring the US teaching his unique and scrupulous brand of filmmaking at workshops and showing his films to audiences at art house theaters, colleges, universities and media art centers. His methods might be considered guerrilla film making. For example, on the set of "the Gas Cafe", Baker received permission to shoot in a local bar after closing, eliminating the need for a costly studio or constructed set. He set up all his lights on the rigging in the ceiling of the bar. Therefore, as soon as the place closed for the day, all Baker needed to do was turn on his own set of lights and shooting could commence.
Feature films.
Using the money he made from "Good Will Hunting", Kelley financed his first feature film, "Birddog" (1999), the story of used car salesman, Harv Beckman, operating in a trashy part of town. Beckman accidentally comes into possession of a rare 1948 Kaiser automobile, stirring up disturbing revelations about the facts behind the 1948 Vanport, Oregon, flood that destroyed an entire community. The film explores racism, greed, and class in a very corrupt city. It opened the 2000 São Paulo Film Festival in Brazil, and one critic referred to Kelley’s style as "Bruce Springsteen meets David Lynch".
"The Gas Cafe" (2001) has been called "an old Twilight Zone episode, that has collided with Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot". Five people collide in a bar one night. The twist? One is dead, one never lived and the other three are lying. Shot in digital video in just 8 nights and made for $4000, the movie was said to have been funded entirely on unemployment checks.
"Kicking Bird" (2005) is about a 17-year-old high school student, Martin "Bird" Johnson. Considered nothing but white trash, Johnson's mother is in jail, his father gone, one brother in a work camp, and a bitter grandfather who beats him. When the greedy high school track coach sees Martin outrun his whole team, he realizes the boy may be his ticket to a college coaching position. The film was shot with digital video in 18 days with a budget of $5000. The Runner’s Gazette says, "Kicking Bird Kicks Butt!"
Recognition.
Baker is the recipient of a Western States Media Arts Fellowship (1997) as well as grants from the SOROS Fund (2000), The Collins Foundation (2000), the Oregon Arts Commission (1993), Pioneer Fund Emerging Documentary Filmmaker grant for his film "Criminal Justice" (1985), Rose E. Tucker Charitable Trust (1984), The Maurie Clark Foundation (1984), and a technical assistance grant from RACC (2004). Baker has completed two documentaries for the National Endowment for the Arts and the Juvenile Justice Office of the Department of Justice (1999).
The Stirling Art Centre at Macrobert University in Stirling, Scotland, ran a retrospective of Kelley's work in 2006. The Pacific Film Archives and The Northwest Film Center have hosted a retrospective of Baker's short films.

He has also worked with Roger Corman as Assistant ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) Mixer on "Humanoids from the Deep" in 1996.
Projects in film education.
As proprietor of Angry Filmmaker, Baker tours the United States and United Kingdom teaching about indie filmmaking at workshops and showing his films to audiences at art house theaters, colleges, universities and media art centers. Baker has appeared in over 200 cities and 350 college and media arts venues.

No One Here Gets Out Alive (album)

No One Here Gets Out Alive is a box set by the band The Doors, released in 2001.
The box set consists of four shows, one on each disc, of a syndicated radio show called "Innerview". The show was a music interview series that was hosted by Los Angeles disc jockey Jim Ladd.
The box set consists of music by the Doors and interviews of the surviving members of the band. Various topics are discussed, even the possibility of singer Jim Morrison being alive and well in Africa. Drummer John Densmore only answers the question regarding Morrison being alive after the tape recorder has been switched off, effectively furthering the Morrison myth.
Production.
The shows themselves took two years to produce and aired around the same time the book of the same name was released; during the summer of 1979. Each week, a new one-hour episode would air, spanning four weeks.
The shows were initially released as a limited edition vinyl box set. The release was limited to 150 copies, many of which were kept by the radio station employees themselves. The CD box set was mastered by Bruce Botnick from the vinyl discs in the possession of then Doors manager Danny Sugerman's younger brother, Chip Sugerman. The vinyl source of the discs is noticeable in places.
All commercials present on the original vinyl records have been removed, with each disc thus ending up at roughly 45 minutes.

Suchak Data Systems, Inc. is a provider of core processing, online banking, branch automation and other related information products and outsourcing for community based financial institutions.
Company history.
Suchak Data Systems, also known as SDS, is a privately owned corporation that was formed in 1981 by the company's founder and CEO, Vinod D. Suchak. Mr. Suchak recognized that community banks were small and agile organizations and their needs were not effectively being meet by large service organizations.
Over the years, SDS has been successful at organizing cooperative efforts between community banks to develop new technology and services. These collaborative efforts solved a major problem for many small community banks, in that they did not have the technology resources to independently compete with large Regional and National Banks. Sometimes these efforts lead to developing new services and technology before the larger banks.
In 1998, SDS expanded its offerings into a "service bureau" to combine various functions into one package for community banks, and began operating their newly created data center to drive the banks ATM's and provide EFT and Telephone Banking Services from Grand Island, NY.
In 2000, SDS expanded its offerings to include Online Banking Solutions, including Cash Manager, Bill Payment and online purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds. In developing the technology that allowed community banks to purchase U.S. Treasury Bonds online, an award was presented to Mr. Suchak by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2001.
In 2002 SDS began offering Check / Document Imaging and Deposit and Loan Accounting Systems.
Since then, SDS has added other offerings such as Branch Capture, Remote Deposit, Teller Automation, Teller Capture, BSA and other strategic solutions that help community banks grow through technology.

Coronini

Coronini (; until 1996 Pescari ; or "Koronini"; occasionally referred to as "Peskari" in German) is a commune in Caraş-Severin County, western Romania, with a population of 1,674. Part of the region of Banat, it includes Coronini and Sfânta Elena villages. Situated on the Danube and the border with Serbia, part of the mountainous area known as Clisura Dunării, Coronini holds several archeological sites, which trace its history back to the Bronze Age. The locality is also home to a medieval fortress built by rulers of the Hungarian Kingdom. A center for immigration from the Czech lands in the early 19th century, Sfânta Elena is among the traditional places founded by and associated with the Czech-Romanian community. 
Coronini as a whole was transformed by 20th century political changes, industrialization and economic fluctuations: Coronini village became a center for the mining industry, while Sfânta Elena was heavily affected rural-urban migration, and eventually by voluntary resettlement in the Czech Republic. During the 1990s, the commune became ill-famed as a hub for contraband in petroleum products.
Location and demographics.
The Coronini commune is located on the foothills of the Southern Carpathians, where these meet the Danube, and in proximity to the Clisura Dunării and Iron Gates areas. Facing Serbia on the right bank of the Danube, it is also close to a canyon formed by the Alibeg River. The Sfânta Elena area is located on a karstic plateau, which groups sinkholes and limestone pavements, features also present in neighboring areas (Berzasca, the Mudaviţa Seacă Valley, etc.). The area has also been described as fault plain, part of the Banat Mountains graben (itself known as "Coroniniului" or "Lászlóvára").
Coronini lends its name to the Coronini-Bedina nature reserve, which covers 3,864.80 hectares. It is also, with Sicheviţa, the proposed site of a new nature reserve, "Fețele Dunării" ("Facets of the Danube"), which is supposed to cover some 1,100 hectares.
According to the 2011 census, the commune is home to 1,381 Romanians and 289 Czechs. At the 2002 census, most of the 1,878 inhabitants were Romanian Orthodox (1,120 people), while 382 were Baptist and 368 Roman Catholic.
History.
Coronini village.
The history of Coronini leads back beyond the period when the Banat area was an Imperial Roman domain ("see Roman Dacia"). It houses several archeological sites, which focus on cave paintings and dwellings Basarabi culture (8th-7th centuries BC), as well as the mines of Vărad (intensively used from the Bronze Age as a source of gold, silver, copper, lead and iron). Among the oldest artifacts found in the village are Hallstatt tools (discovered in 1972) and a bronze vessel with 178 silver coins, predating the Roman expeditions. Coronini was also the site of Halstatt funerals, probably related to those found on Moldova Veche sites. The Roman period itself is attested by a "denarius" issued under Emperor Alexander Severus.
The medieval period, when Banat was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, left several traces on Coronini's landscape. The location houses the 15th century Saint Ladislaus (Hungarian: "Szentlázló"; historical Hungarian: "Zenthlázlówára") fortress, part of the historical sites in the Iron Gates Natural Park area. Archeological investigation carried out in 1970-1973 found that it was built on top of Dacian fortifications and newer walls erected in the 6th-7th century, and that the Hungarian building was probably erected in the 15th century, in tandem with a similar one in Golubac. The decision to construct Saint Ladislaus is thought to have come directly from King Sigismund, whereas other Banat fortresses from the period were inaugurated by his vassal Pipo of Ozora. The medieval period also produced new cave paintings and traces of habitation in the caves, some of which are superimposed over their Basarabi culture predecessors. Also then, the village came to house a quarry.
Known successively as "Lászlóvára" and "Pescari", the locality was in turn part of the Habsburg domains, the Austrian Empire, Austria-Hungary and, following Banat's 1918 union, Romania. It came to rely on the copper industry throughout the communist period, a factor which prevented its population from migrating into Timişoara and other towns. It was, with Moldova Nouă town, one of two only spots in Clisura Dunării area not to register a significant loss in population.
Following the 1989 Revolution and the onset of Romania's transition, Pescari became the center of public attention during the 1990s embargo imposed by the United Nations on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ("see Yugoslav Wars"). Profiting from this situation, it became a main hub for a clandestine Romanian traffic with oil products, which were transported over the border and into present-day Serbia. Allegedly, the Pescari villagers made regular nightly trips with such items, meeting their Serb counterparts on the middle course of the Danube. After the end of the conflict, the population came to rely on subsistence agriculture, ecotourism and fishing for income. It again made the news in 2008, when a German tourist to Coronini captured a giant catfish, weighing in at almost 100 kilograms.
Sfânta Elena.
The village of Sfânta Elena ("Saint Helen"; ; ) was founded by Czech settlers in 1824, during the Imperial Austrian rule over the region ("see Czechs of Romania"). It is the oldest Czech settlement in the region, and the only such locality in Romania to hold both a Lutheran and a Roman Catholic church side by side. The first Czechs to settle southern Banat were invited by János Magyarly, a merchant from the town of Oraviţa, and worked in the forestry business. Their decision to leave Bohemia was motivated by the poverty the region faced upon the end of the Napoleonic Wars. First arrivals came from towns in and around the Bohemian Forest (Plzeň, Klatovy, Domažlice), followed later by families from Beroun, Čáslav, Chrudim, Hořovice or Příbram.
They original village they founded was named "Svatá Alžběta" ("Saint Elisabeth") and located some 2 kilometers away from the present-day locality; founded in 1823, it was disestablished in 1847 for lack of water. Both villages had been named after Magyarly's two daughters, marking the Czech community's good relationship with its employer, but, in 1827, the latter abruptly ended the business venture, and left with all the tools used in forestry. This reportedly left Sfânta Elena's inhabitants faced with a dire situation: some took their families back into the Czech lands, others joined the Austrian-led Grenz infantry operating on the Military Frontier. Others still worked on road projects, some as far afield as Serbia. With time, the local Czech group became religiously distinct from other communities: more than half of the population discarded Lutheranism in favor of Baptist denominations ("see Baptist Union of Romania"). This was allegedly a reaction against the ethnic Hungarian Lutheran clergy, perceived as enforcers of Magyarization policies, with the churchgoers opting instead for a Slovak Baptist preacher.
The village and the rest of Banat were united with Romania upon the end of World War I. Between 1830 and 1930, the population had increased from 338 to 916 people. In 1924, a textile factory was set up by a Czech businessman, and it employed most of the female Czech workforce before closing down in 1938. Agriculture declined under the communist regime, when most men were employed in industrial fields (primarily at the mines opened near Moldova Nouă). 
After the December Revolution toppled Romanian communism (and the Velvet Revolution emancipated Czechoslovakia), many inhabitants of the village left Romania and settled in what became the Czech Republic—with population numbers dropping back to 350 persons. A new Czech-language school was opened in 1998, but attendance had fallen from 150 to 70 pupils in the space of 6 years. The mines employing Sfânta Elena's population were closed down in 2004, as part of Romania's economic transition. After that date, the village continued to face economical and social problems, including lack of plumbing and sewage facilities.

Domașnea

Domașnea () is a commune in Caraș-Severin County, western Romania with a population of 1,371 people. It is composed of two villages, Cănicea ("Szörénykanizsa") and Domașnea.
Description.
Domașnea is situated at 492 m altitude in the south-west part of Romania in Caraș-Severin county.
His total area is 64 ha having as neighbors Teregova to the north, Rusca to the northwest, Cornereva to the east, Cornea to the south, Mehadica to the southwest and Luncavița to the west. The distance between Domașnea and the county administrative center, Reșița, is 90 km. The other important cities are Caransebeș at 45 km and Băile Herculane at 25 km.
Domașnea name comes from the Latin word "domus", plus the Latin suffix [(n)ia], meaning "the place with big houses". The Slavonian "domas" is a corrupt form of the same Latin word, and has the same meaning (house, domestic).
After the great migrations period, according to a document published by the Hungarian historian Frigzes, Domașnea was mentioned for the first time in 1436. However, some new evidence, especially those made by Dr. Dimitrie Roman, bring up to light a document which indicates the fact that a group of houses were certainly located on the border of the village from 159 BC. This document it is a military Certificate issued on the name of a Celtic soldier named Ivornecus by the Rman emperor Hadrianus, on 27 September 159 A.D. This is a bronze tablet so named "Tabula Honestae Missions", and it is now stored at the Antiquity Museum in Wien (AU) under the name D.XVII.
In 1962 Domașnea was collectivized, being the only one of this area which was forced to adopt this system.
This village saw an outbreak of the anti-communist movement from the Banat region.

Battle of Bun Garbhain

The Battle of Bun Garbhain was a Scottish clan battle fought in 1570, in the Scottish Highlands, between the Clan Cameron and the Clan Mackintosh. 
Donald Dubh Cameron, XV Chief of Clan Cameron, had died, leaving an infant son, Allan, at the head of the clan. The chief of Clan MacKintosh, leading 200 men, invaded the Cameron lands near Loch Arkaig. A bloody battle ensued. Though outnumbered, the Camerons had the high ground and soon the field was littered with MacKintoshes both dead and injured. The remainder of their army was put to flight. MacKintosh led his men in retreat around the head of Loch Eil to the Ardgour shore and rallied his men. The Camerons were in swift pursuit and a second engagement took place, with similar results as the first. In the midst of this action, the chief of MacKintosh is believed to have been killed by Donald 'Taillear Dubh na Tuaighe' Cameron, (son of the XIV Chief of Clan Cameron), with a fearsome Lochaber axe. MacKintosh's followers took their stricken chief and fell back to Bun Garbhain (Bun Garvan). Both sides met once again for an indeterminate time, before disengaging for the night. The MacKintoshes made camp in a small hollow called Cuil nan Cuileag, and thought that they were safe. However, the Camerons were not done with their mortal enemies, stormed the encampment and fell upon them. Not a single MacKintosh would leave that hollow and the Cameron victory was absolute. The mother of Allan Cameron, the infant chief of Clan Cameron was in fact a MacKintosh. After the battle, Taillear Dubh came to give her an account of the fighting. Enraged with the news of all the dead MacKintosh, she tried to kill her son, but Taillear Dubh intervened in time. Allan Cameron was safe, but his mother was banished from Lochaber forever.

Armed Forces Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh

The Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) is a military medical college in Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is run by the Military of Bangladesh and is under the Ministry of Defense of Bangladesh. A Major General of Bangladesh Army's Medical Corps is the Commandant of the College. It has two types of students. Medical Cadets (AFMC cadets) and Army Medical Corps Cadets (AMC cadets). AFMC cadets can become civilian doctors after completing the MBBS course but AMC cadets should join the Army Medical Corps (AMC) of Bangladesh Army .
The college is listed in the AVICENNA Directory for Medicine (previously known as the WHO World Directory of Medical Schools)
__TOC__
History.
The academic activities of Armed Forces Medical College commenced through induction of 56 medical cadets on 20 June 1999. The college is affiliated to Bangladesh University of Professionals and recognized by Bangladesh Medical & Dental Council (BMDC). So far 15 batches of total 1097 students have been inducted. The students of the first 10 batches are now doctors and the 9th batch has completed their internship training in the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Dhaka. Remaining batches are progressing as per the academic schedule. The admission is based on merit keeping in conformity with Government order published vide AFMC instruction -1/2003
Aims and objectives.
AFMC aims to train its students for five academic years in accordance with the syllabus laid down by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC) for the MBBS degree, so as to train a group of quality doctors for the Armed Forces and the nation.
The objectives of Armed Forces Medical College (according to the official website) are:
Dormitories.
AFMC is a residential institution, with the students viewed as 'medical cadets'. It is compulsory for cadets to stay in the dormitories as provided by the college authority. The cadets must follow all rules and regulations regarding customs and etiquette, decorum and decency of the dormitory living as framed (or will be framed from time to time) by the college authority. There are separate dormitories for male and female medical cadets near the college campus.
The cadets are provided with messing and allied services including laundry facilities. The messing, laundry and allied charges are paid by the cadets. On arrival to the college, the medical cadets are issued with the necessary uniforms and other supporting items, the costs of which are included in the fees.
The boys dorm and the girls dorm are identical in structure. Each dormitory is composed of two blocks and eight floors with a total of 160 rooms (80 rooms in each block) that hold two cadets each, so a potential total of 320 students can stay in each dormitory. The bathrooms are shared between two rooms and consist of two toilet-and-shower rooms and two sinks. There is also a TV room, a prayer room and a waiting room (for parents and guardians) on the first (ground) floor as well as a dining room on the second floor.
After passing the final exam, interns must move out of the student dorms and thereafter they may choose whether to go to work from home or from the internee dormitory; it's not compulsory for interns to stay in the internee dormitory as it is for cadets. The internee dormitory itself is different in structure - there are no separate buildings for the boys and girls but rather a single building with a demarcation in between i.e. no connection between either sides of the dorm. The boys side and the girls side of the dorm are mirror images of each other: each side has six floors, the top five floors having six rooms on each floor, so a total of 30 rooms for each side and a potential total of 60 boys or girls can be housed (120 interns in total). The internee dorm rooms are larger than their student counterparts and also contain a separate bathroom in each room. There is also technically a dining room, living room and kitchen on the ground floor. 
Subjects and examinations.
Like any other medical college in Bangladesh, the five year course is divided into three parts (the first part being preclinical), with each part leading up to a professional examination (or 'prof') and consisting of subjects specific to that prof.
The First Professional Examination (done in second year) consists of:
The Second Professional Examination (done in fourth year) consists of:
The Final Professional Examination (done in fifth year) consists of:
AFMC is the only medical college in Bangladesh affiliated with Bangladesh University of Professionals (until recent years it was affiliated with University of Dhaka)
The internship that follows completion of the course is carried out for a year at the nearby Combined Military Hospital (CMH). Internship there is compulsory, though foreign students are not paid.
Extracurricular activities.
Only during certain times of the year (like Culture Week) do a range of extracurricular activities become available to the cadets, such as competitions of extempore speech, poem recitation, singing, dancing and a selection of sports.
Otherwise there are some facilities provided inside or within the vicinity of both dormitories for cadets to play within their free time - arrangements for chess, carrom, table tennis, badminton, volleyball, basketball, football and cricket.

John Downton

John Downton (1906–1991) was an English artist, philosopher, musician, and poet. 
Born at Erith. Kent, Downton drew well from an early age. At age fifteen he won the youth silver medal of the Royal Drawing Society. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge (1925–1928), first in English and then in Art History, and then trained as a painter at the Slade. Downton played the violin all his life, was often invited to give performances, and always participated in the fortnight-long Grittleton Summer School of Music in Malvern, Worcestershire. He also wrote books, such as "The Death of Art" (1937) and "Craftsmanship, Art and Criticism" (1993). But it is his paintings for which he is now chiefly remembered. His main subject was young girlhood, rendered in the manner of the Italian old masters and with the tempera technique that had been revived by the Birmingham Group.
Both his subject matter and his techniques were deeply unfashionable during most of his adult life, and he ceased to exhibit after the start of the Second World War, during which he was a conscientious objector, working on the land in Shropshire and Pitlochry, Scotland. He never married, and lived mostly in Cambridge. On his death, all his work passed to The Downton Trust.
A major retrospective exhibition and catalogue was produced in 1996, and the exhibition toured the UK. His three main masterpieces are: "The Battle" (1935, now in Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery); "Portrait of a Girl" (1938, now in The Tate); "Nora Russell" (1935, location unknown).
There is an annual John Downton Award for Young Artists, given to those attending secondary schools in the county of Kent.

Justesen code

In coding theory, Justesen codes form a class of error-correcting codes that have a constant rate, constant relative distance, and a constant alphabet size.
Before the Justesen code was discovered, no code was known that had all of these three parameters as a constant.
Subsequently, other codes with this property have been discovered, for example expander codes.
These codes have important applications in computer science such as in the construction of small-bias sample spaces.
Justesen codes are derived as the code concatenation of a Reed–Solomon code and the Wozencraft ensemble.
The Reed–Solomon codes used achieve constant rate and constant relative distance at the expense of an alphabet size that is "linear" in the message length.
The Wozencraft ensemble is a family of codes that achieve constant rate and constant alphabet size, but the relative distance is only constant for most of the codes in the family.
The concatenation of the two codes first encodes the message using the Reed–Solomon code, and then encodes each symbol of the codeword further using a code from the Wozencraft ensemble – using a different code of the ensemble at each position of the codeword.
This is different from usual code concatenation where the inner codes are the same for each position.
The Justesen code can be can constructed very efficiently using only logarithmic space.
Definition.
Justesen code is concatenation code with different linear inner codes, which is composed of an formula_1 outer code formula_2 and different formula_3 inner codes formula_4, formula_5. More precisely, the concatenation of these codes, denoted by formula_6, is defined as follows. Given a message formula_7, we compute the codeword produced by an outer code formula_2: formula_9. Then we apply each code of N linear inner codes to each coordinate of that codeword to produce the final codeword; that is, formula_10. Look back to the definition of the outer code and linear inner codes, this definition of the Justesen code makes sense because the codeword of the outer code is a vector with formula_11 elements, and we have formula_11 linear inner codes to apply for those formula_11 elements.
Here for the Justesen code, the outer code formula_2 is chosen to be Reed Solomon code over a field formula_15 evaluated over formula_16 of rate formula_17, formula_18 < formula_17 < formula_20. The outer code formula_2 have the relative distance formula_22 and block length of formula_23. The set of inner codes is the Wozencraft ensemble formula_24.
Property of Justesen Code.
As the linear codes in the Wonzencraft ensemble have the rate formula_25, Justesen code is the concatenated code formula_26 with the rate formula_27. We have the following theorem that estimates the distance of the concatenated code formula_28.
Theorem.
Let formula_29 > 0. formula_28 has relative distance at least formula_31.
Proof: 
The idea of proving that the code formula_28 has the distance at least formula_33 is to prove that the Hamming distance of two different codewords is at least formula_33.
Denote formula_35 be the Hamming distance of two codewords formula_36 and formula_37.
So for any given formula_38 and formula_39 in formula_40 (formula_41), we want to lower bound formula_42.
Notice that if formula_9, then formula_44. So to the lower bound formula_42, we need to take into account the distance of formula_4 for i = 1,2,…,N.
Suppose formula_47 and formula_48.
Recall that formula_49 is a Wozencraft ensemble. Due to "Wonzencraft ensemble theorem", there are at least formula_50 linear codes formula_4 that have distance formula_52. 
So if for some formula_5, formula_54 and formula_4 code has distance formula_56, then formula_57.
Further, if we have formula_58 numbers formula_5 such that formula_54 and formula_4 code has distance formula_56, then formula_63. 
So now the final task is to lower bound formula_58. 
Denote S be the set of all formula_65 (formula_5) such that formula_54. Then formula_58 is the number of linear codes formula_4 (formula_70) having the distance formula_52.
Now we want to estimate formula_72. Obviously formula_73.
Due to the Wozencraft Ensemble Theorem, there are at most formula_74 linear codes having distance less than formula_52, so formula_76.
Finally,we have
This is true for any arbitrary formula_41. So formula_28 has the relative distance at least formula_31, which completes the proof.
Comments.
We want to consider the "strongly explicit code". So the question is what the "strongly explicit code" is. Loosely speaking, for linear code, the "explicit" property is related to the complexity of constructing its generator matrix G. That means, we can compute the matrix in logarithmic space without using the brute force algorithm to verify that a code has a given satisfied distance. 
For the other codes that are not linear, we can consider the complexity of the encoding algorithm. 
So by far, we can see that the Wonzencraft ensemble and Reed-Solomon codes are strongly explicit. Therefore we have the following result:
Corollary: The concatenated code formula_28 is an asymptotically good code(that is, rate formula_17 > 0 and relative distance formula_83 > 0 for small q) and has a strongly explicit construction.
An example of a Justesen code.
The following slightly different code is referred to as the Justesen code in MacWilliams/MacWilliams. It is the particular case of the above-considered 
Justesen code for a very particular Wonzencraft ensemble:
Let "R" be a Reed-Solomon code of length "N" = 2"m" − 1, rank "K" and minimum weight "N" − "K" + 1. The symbols of "R" are elements of "F" = GF(2"m") and the codewords are obtained by taking every polynomial ƒ over "F" of degree less than "K" and listing the values of ƒ on the non-zero elements of "F" in some predetermined order. Let α be a primitive element of "F". For a codeword a = ("a"1, ..., "a""N") from "R", let b be the vector of length 2"N" over "F" given by
and let c be the vector of length 2"N" "m" obtained from "b" by expressing each element of "F" as a binary vector of length "m". The "Justesen code" is the linear code containing all such c.
The parameters of this code are length 2"m" "N", dimension "m" "K" and minimum distance at least 
where formula_86 is the greatest integer satisfying formula_87. (See MacWilliams/MacWilliams for a proof.)

Velvet Revolver discography

The following is a complete discography of hard rock band Velvet Revolver. Since 2003, they have released 2 studio albums, 1 extended play (EP) and 8 singles. Their most successful album was "Contraband", which reached No. 1 in the US and was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA. Their most successful single was "Slither", which reached No. 1 in both the "Billboard" Hot Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts. Their only EP, "Melody and the Tyranny", did not chart in the US or the UK.
Velvet Revolver is a Grammy Award-winning hard rock supergroup consisting of former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum, alongside Dave Kushner formerly of punk band Wasted Youth. Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland was Velvet Revolver's lead singer since their formation until parting ways with the band in 2008. In 2004, the band achieved commercial success with their debut album, 'Contraband'. Critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses, and criticized the band for a "disconnection" between Scott Weiland and the rest of the band. With their single "Slither", they won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance.
The band released "Libertad" in 2007, driven by the release of the single "She Builds Quick Machines", and embarked on a tour with Alice in Chains. In April 2008, Weiland parted ways with Velvet Revolver since he reunited with Stone Temple Pilots. Velvet Revolver has been on indefinite hiatus since April and in November 2008, the band was released by their record label Sony BMG/RCA Records at their request to allow them "complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish" replacing Weiland.

Ain't She Tweet

"Ain't She Tweet" is a "Looney Tunes" (reissued as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies) cartoon animated short starring Tweety and Sylvester. Released June 21, 1952, the cartoon is directed by Friz Freleng. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc and Bea Benaderet.
The title is a play on the song "Ain't She Sweet."
Plot.
Sylvester stands outside a pet store window, watching Tweety (singing "Fiddle-De-Di") in the display area. Tweety angers Sylvester when the bird goes over to a mouse (the comments, apparently unflattering ones about the cat, are muted using Carl Stalling's music); Sylvester replies: "Laugh this off" and tries to throw a brick at the window. However, upon seeing a cop walk up behind Sylvester, the would-be puddy vandal runs in front of the brick and absorbs the blow.
As Sylvester is planning to cut through the glass window with a glass cutter, a deliveryman takes Tweety away, to be delivered to Granny's house. Sylvester follows the deliveryman and rushes into the yard, only to discover a whole army of bulldogs.
The rest of the cartoon contains Sylvester's attempts (all unsuccessful) to get at Tweety:
Finally, Sylvester decides to wait until the early morning to tip-toe silently through the yard. The alarm clock goes off at 4 a.m., awakening the dogs and pummeling the cat one last time. Tweety innocently comments: "Now who do wuw suppowse would want to distwurb dose doggies so eawly in da morning?" before winking at the audience as the camera irises out.

Nicholas of Poland

Nicholas of Poland, also known as Nicholas of Montpellier () (b. c. 1235, Silesia; d. Kraków, c. 1316), was a medieval Polish-German friar and healer of Silesian origin. A member of the Dominican Order, around 1250 he moved to Montpellier, where he taught in the Dominican school. Around 1270, he returned to Silesia and entered the Dominican convent at Kraków (Cracow), where he provided medical as well as spiritual care to the people.
A popular and charismatic healer, Nicholas was the focus of an ‘alternative’ medical movement that flourished in Upper Silesia in the late-thirteenth century. He was also a favorite in the court of Leszek the Black (Lestko Nigritius), the duke of Sieradz. Nicholas’s methods were extremely unorthodox. Urging a return to ‘natural’ methods of healing, he attributed extraordinary virtues to toads, scorpions, and lizards. His favorite remedy was serpents’ flesh prepared according to detailed instructions contained in his treatise, "Experimenta magistri Nicolai" (Master Nicholas’s Experiments), a compilation of his medicaments. He urged all people, "of whatever station, to eat serpents whenever it is possible to get them." Evidently impressed by Nicholas’s doctrine, Leszek ordered that serpents, lizards, and frogs be served at his court.
Nicholas was educated at Montpellier during a period when Scholastic medicine was highly developed. However, Nicholas appears to have rejected the academic medical tradition, opting instead for an 'empirical' medical system. His drugs were based upon the principle that God had conferred 'marvelous' virtues on common things like serpents and toads. In fact, he believed, the more common the object, the more precious were its medicinal virtues. Hence, remedies made of contemptible creatures contained greater medicinal virtues than such ‘precious' drugs like theriac (which to Nicholas was just snake meat). Nicholas invoked the authority of ‘master Albert’ to confirm his doctrine, a reference to the popular "De mirabilibus mundi" ("On the Miracles of the World") attributed to Albertus Magnus.

Barbados at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Barbados sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The island nation made its tenth appearance as an independent nation upon its arrival in Beijing. Eight athletes across three sports and ten events represented Barbados, marking the smallest delegation in its history up to the Beijing Games. Its runners and swimmers advanced past the first rounds in their events in four of the their nine events, although none advanced to their events' final rounds or medaled. The nation's flagbearer during the Beijing Games was swimmer Bradley Ally.
Background.
Barbados is the easternmost of the islands located within the Caribbean Sea. Home to 280,000 residents, Barbados was first settled by the British in the 1620s. The nation remained a British colony until it declared total independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The very first appearance of a uniquely Barbadian delegation at the Olympic games came two years after it declared independence from the United Kingdom. At its debut, nine male athletes arrived to participated at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Previously, Barbados (as a British colony) constituted a major part of the West Indies Federation along with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, which sent a delegation to participate at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.
Between its 1968 debut and its appearance at the Beijing Olympics, Barbadian delegations appeared at every Summer Olympics except for the 1980 Summer Olympics, which took place in Moscow in the Soviet Union. With the exceptions of the 1968 and the 2008 Barbadian teams, every appearance by Barbados at the Olympics (as of Beijing) included at least ten athletes; its smallest delegation arrived in 2008, carrying only eight competitors. All the delegations except the one that arrived in 1968 have included female athletes. Prior to and including the 2008 Beijing Olympics, there had been one medalist from Barbados. Obadele Thompson won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, as part of Barbados' most successful showing at any Olympic games as of 2008.
In Beijing, eight athletes participated across three sports (swimming, track and field, and sailing) in ten distinct events. Gregory Douglas, the nation's only sailor in Beijing, was the youngest participant from Barbados at 18 years old; runner Jade Bailey, the only female athlete in the delegation, was the oldest, at 25 years old. There were no medalists from Barbados at Beijing. Swimmer Bradley Ally bore the flag of Barbados at the ceremonies.
Athletics.
In track and field events, there were two ways to qualify for later rounds. The first way, "qualifying by right", involves ranking high enough in one's heat. Athletes could also "qualify by result"; if they did not rank high enough in their heats but were high enough in the event's overall standings, they could also advance.
Men's competition.
Andrew Hinds participated for the Barbadian team at the Beijing Olympics, participating in the men's 100 meters dash. Born in 1984, he is the son of former Olympian Hadley Hinds, and has been affiliated in training with the MVP Track and Field Club in Kingston, Jamaica. Hinds participated in the Beijing Olympics at age 24, and had not previously participated in any Olympic games prior to that. During the qualification round of the event, which took place on August 14, Hinds participated in the third heat. He completed the race in 10.35 seconds, placing fifth out of the heat's eight athletes. Indonesia's Suryo Agung Wibowo ranked behind him in sixth place (10.46 seconds), while Ghana's Aziz Zakari ranked ahead of him in fourth place (10.34 seconds). Trinidad and Tobago's Richard Thompson (10.24 seconds) and France's Martial Mbandjock (10.26 seconds) led the Barbadian sprinter's heat. of the 80 athletes participating in the event, Hinds tied Colombia's Daniel Grueso and the Netherlands Antilles' Churandy Martina for 27th place. He advanced to the quarterfinal round.
During the quarterfinal round, which took place on August 15, Hinds was placed in the second heat. Eight athletes participated in the heat, and Hinds placed fifth with a time of 10.25 seconds.

La Vie de Jésus

La vie de Jésus (English: "The Life of Jesus") is the 1997 debut feature film by director Bruno Dumont. It was the winner of the prestigious BFI Sutherland Trophy, Camera d’Or at Cannes, the Prix Jean Vigo and European Discovery of the Year at the European Film Awards.
Freddy: unemployed, with learning difficulties and epilepsy, drives around on a motorbike and experiences his first sexual encounters in the rather depressing fields of the countryside of northern France. When the handsome immigrant Kader flirts with Freddy's beloved cashier Marie, Freddy plans to take revenge.
Controversy.
Dumont included extreme close-ups of penetration in "The Life of Jesus" to emphasize the animal nature of the sex act, which takes place outdoors in a field. In order to keep a natural feel and astmosphere, the director deliberately used non-professional actors. Freddy and the other boys' sexual assault on a slightly overweight girl, also made for uncomfortable viewing. Dumont seemed to portray general pack behaviour as predatory, territorial and base, particularly among the younger males - with the elders of the village acting as a communal control but only as a last resort. Dumont's main aim was to maintain a gritty sense of realism, about both the subject matter and questioning the social fabric in a modern context.

Gustav Globočnik Edler von Vojka

Gustav Viktor Josef Globočnik Edler von Vojka (10 November 1859 – 24 September 1946), was an Austrian soldier and nobleman. He achieved rank of Lieutenant-Field-Marshal (Feldmarschalleutnant) in Austro-Hungarian Army.
Private life.
Born in Reichenburg, Austrian Empire, today known as Brestanica in Slovenia. Brestanica is a small town located approximately 60 km from Zagreb, Croatia, and 100 km from Ljubljana, Slovenia. Globočnik is son of Viktor Globočnik and Sofija born Klemenčić. They had four children: three daughters and a son.
Viktor Globočnik was k.u.k. financial consultor in Zagreb. Family Globočnik owned Thurn castle.
Gustav Globočnik was awarded for his military service and loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty with nobleman title Edler von Vojka by Diploma from 20th Feb. 1917. 
He was also awarded with Honor Citizenship in several towns: Reichenburg (Brestanica), Feistritz, Domschale, Mitterndorf and Koprivnik (Carniola)
Gustav Globočnik married Emma Julie Wüster in Vienna at 16 September 1893. They had one child, a son named Alexander Valerian.
Career.
Gustav Globočnik started his military career by graduation in Officer Cadet School on 18 August 1880. He was pensioned on 1 January 1919 in rank of Feldmarschalleutnant (equivalent to Anglo Lieutenant-Field-Marshal).
World War I.
Gustav Globočnik in World War I was a commander of various formations in XV. Corps: 56th Infantry Regiment, 26th Gebirgsbrigade, 92nd Infantry Regiment, 33rd Infantry Regiment and Group Globočnik.
He fought in the Serbian Campaign (World War I) and later on Battles of the Isonzo. 
In Fifth Battle of the Isonzo that was fought from March 9–15, 1916, Generalmajor Gustav Globočnik fought as commander of Group Globočnik in X. Army under commandment of Generaloberst Franz Rohr von Denta.
Alexander Valerian Globočnik Edler von Vojka.
Alexander Globočnik-Vojka is a son of Gustav Globočnik Edler von Vojka and Emma Julie born Wüster. Due to his father military career, family often moved around Austrian-Hungarian Empire. Therefore, Alexander was born in Przemyśl, today in Poland on 10 January 1895. He was an Austro-Hungarian lawyer and nobleman. After Austrian monarchy came down and Republic was established, nobility titles became forbidden so he used name Alexander Globočnik-Vojka.
His most notable law case is Globočnik-Vojka vs Austria. Alexander Globočnik-Vojka died on 16 May 1974.
Globočnik-Vojka vs Austria.
Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian bank was put into liquidation. Rights of the bondholders where settled in 1939 extra-juridical settlement. Liquidators undertook to pay $210,000 to the bondholders out of monies then on deposit with the United States Treasury. Problem was that money was confiscated by the United States Government as enemy property during The First World War. Finally, the United States Office of Alien Property transferred a sum of just over $45,000 to the liquidators and authorized them to transfer it to the Austrian Government. Rest of the money was transferred to the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia.
The plaintiff, representing the bondholders claimed that the Austrian Government would be unjustly enriched if it decides not to repay bondholders. 
The Provincial Court for Civil Law Matters in Vienna by decree of 28 September 1951, appointed as curator and guardian of the rights of all the bondholders in the Austro-Hungarian bank in Vienna, Dr. Alexander Globočnik-Vojka. By the judgment of Austria Supreme Court from 14 May 1958, the appeal was dismissed. Bondholders didn't succeed to retain money.
The Case Globočnik-Vojka vs Austria became famous internationally through law circles.
Odilo Globočnik.
As far as it's known, Odilo Globocnik and Gustav Globočnik von Vojka are not related. This question has been raised since they share surname and bot had successful military career. Further speculation is possible due to a fact that Odilo Globočnik was born in Trieste on 21 April 1904, at time when Gustav Globočnik von Vojka was living in Trieste (1901–1905). Fact is that Odilo Globocnik is a son of Franc Globočnik, another k.u.k. officer, a cavalry liutenant.
Odilo Globocnik was SS Obergruppenführer and convicted war crime criminal. Shortly after capture in 1945, Globocnik committed suicide by means of a cyanide capsule hidden in his mouth.
If there is any family relation, Odilo Globocnik would be more than happy to point that out. A k.u.k. Feldmarschalleutnant and a noble relative could only give a boost to a military career in Third Reich.

Bermuda at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Bermuda sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The games marked Bermuda's twenty-first Olympic appearance since its debut in 1936. The 2008 delegation included six athletes: Tyrone Smith and Arantxa King in long jump, Jillian Terceira in individual jumping on horseback, Kiera Aitken and Roy-Allan Burch in swimming (Aitken in backstroke, and Burch in freestyle), and Flora Duffy in triathlon. Bermuda did not win any medals in the Beijing games.
Background.
Bermuda's debut in the Olympic Games began with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Nazi Germany, when the Bermudian delegation included five athletes, all men. Bermuda had appeared in twenty-one Olympic Games between 1936 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics. Of those twenty-one games, sixteen of them were Summer Olympics. Bermuda had, prior to Beijing, earned one medal, when Clarence Hill won bronze in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 2008 Bermudian delegation had fewer people than it usually sent abroad, prompting the president of the Bermudian Olympic Association Austin Woods to complain publicly that the year's Olympic team lacked access to quality coaches, administrators, and facilities, and with the exception of several athletes, lacked the skill to be competitive.
Bermuda dispatched six athletes in total to the Beijing Olympics. Of the delegation, two of the athletes (Roy-Allen Burch and Tyrone Smith) were men and four of the athletes (Flora Duffy, Kiera Aitken, Arantxa King, and Jill Terceira) were women. King was the youngest Bermudian participant during the 2008 Olympics, at 18 years of age, and Terceira was the oldest, at 37. No Bermudian athlete advanced to a final round during the 2008 Games.
Athletics.
Two people competed in track and field representing Bermuda: Tyrone Smith and Arantxa King. Smith participated in men's long jump, while Arantxa King participated in women's long jump. Neither advanced past the qualifying rounds in Beijing.
Former Missouri S&T student Tyrone "Sticks" Smith earned a spot on Bermuda's team when he finished in third place at the long jump event that took place during the 2008 Central American and Caribbean Championships in Cali, Columbia. Smith's appearance at the Beijing Olympics was his first at any of the Olympic games. During the course of the event at the Olympics, Smith was placed in Heat 2 of the August 16 qualifying rounds, set to compete against athletes that included Irving Jahir Saladino Aranda of Panama (who won the gold medal in finals) and Ngonidzashe Makusha of Zimbabwe (who was fourth-place runner-up in finals). Out of twenty competitors, Smith ranked seventh with a distance of 7.91 meters. He was 0.1 meters ahead of Fabrice Lapierre of Australia, who placed eighth in the qualifying round, and 0.13 meters behind heat leader Makusha. Tyrone Smith was three centimeters short of a distance that would have qualified him for finals, and did not progress.
Stanford first-year student Arantxa King was chosen by the Bermuda Olympic Association on Wednesday, July 23, 2008 through the use of its IAAF female at-large selection. Her participation in the 2008 Beijing Olympics marked her Olympic debut. During the August 18 Qualifying rounds, King was placed in Heat 2 versus competitors that included Russia's Tatiana Lebedeva and Nigeria's Blessing Okhagbare, both of whom received medals in the event finals. King jumped a distance of 6.01 meters, 0.69 meters behind leading qualifier Lebedeva's score, placing nineteenth (out of twenty-one) in the event. She placed last in the heat, ahead of two disqualified athletes, and thirty-sixth (out of forty-two) athletes when considering all heats at once. Arantxa King did not progress to the next and final round on August 22.
Equestrian.
Jillian Terceira was not originally chosen to participate on Bermuda's Olympic team, and was passed up for Patrick Nisbett and his horse, Antille 8. This occurred when neither Terceira nor Nisbett qualified for an Olympic spot at the equestrian finals in Hong Kong, caused in part by the injury of Terceira's horse, Navantus. Because Bermuda was allowed only one horse rider, the Bermuda Equestrian Federation awarded their one reserved Olympic spot to Nisbett because Terceira's horse had been injured during the course of the event.
Terceira argued that she had a second horse, Chaka III, who should have been used in the injured Navantus' place, was regularly faster than Nisbett's Antille 8 and should have earned the qualification position. She also accused the Bermuda Equestrian Federation of making the decision based on political or racial motivations, which the organization denied. BEF president Mike Cherry explained that Chaka III did not qualify for the event until June 30, the final day, which is the reason why the horse was not considered for Bermuda's Olympic slot. The BEF organized a final day of competition between Nisbett's Antille and Terceira's Chaka to give Terceira one last opportunity to qualify for an Olympic position. Nisbett, however, withdrew from the Olympic position later that June. Terceira took his place.
Terceira competed in the August 15 preliminaries of individual equestrian jumping. As rankings are derived from the number of penalties that one accumulates, Terceira tied for 39th place with seven other horse riders, having accrued five penalties. Terceira also participated in the August 17th preliminary round, but was eliminated, and did not advance to the finals.
Swimming.
Two swimmers represented Bermuda at the Beijing Olympics: Kiera Aitken and Roy-Allan Burch. Aitken participated in the women's 100 meter backstroke, and Burch swam the men's 100 meter backstroke. Neither advanced past the preliminary round.
Former Dalhousie University student and national record holder Kiera Aitken participated on behalf of Bermuda for her second Olympic appearance after the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Aitken participated in the August 10 preliminaries for the 100 meters women's backstroke, where she was placed in Heat 1 with Paraguay's Maria Virginia Baez and Panama's Christie Marie Bodden Baca. With a time of 1:02.62, Aitken ranked first in her heat, defeating Baez by almost three seconds. However, her overall ranking placed her thirty-third out of forty-nine swimmers between Alana Dillette of the Bahamas (32nd) and Hiu Wai Sherry Tsai of Hong Kong (34th). Aitken was 3.62 seconds slower than Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, who set an Olympic record during the preliminary round with a time of 59.00 seconds. Aitken did not make the time necessary to progress to the next round.
Former Springfield College student and national record-setter Roy-Allan Burch, the only male swimmer who participated on behalf of Bermuda's Olympic team, swam in the 100 meter freestyle event after undergoing an irregular training schedule with coach John Taffe necessitated by the recent death of his mother by cancer. During August 12, Burch competed in the preliminaries for his event, and was placed in Heat 2. He swam the event in 52.65 seconds, placing fifth out of six athletes in the heat, immediately after Obaid Ahmed Aljesmi of the United Arab Emirates. The heat leader, Jan Roodzant of the Dutch colony Aruba, completed the event in 51.69 seconds. Overall, Roy-Allan Burch ranked sixty out of sixty-four athletes. Eamon Sullivan of Australia, the leader of the preliminary times, was approximately four seconds ahead of Burch. Roy-Allan Burch did not proceed to the semifinal rounds.
Triathlon.
Flora Duffy was invited to participate in the Beijing Olympics based on her performance in the qualification competitions. Participating on the August 18 event, Duffy competed in the women's triathlon. Duffy swam the 1.5 kilometers portion of the distance in 20:26 minutes, ranking 41st out of 55 in that portion of the event, behind Luxembourg's Liz May (40th) by under a second and ahead of Hungary's Zita Szabó by two seconds. In this portion of the event, Duffy was 37 seconds behind the United States' Laura Bennett, who finished the swimming portion of the event first at 19:49. Duffy took 33 seconds to make the transition from swim to cycling, the second part of the event, tying with Mak So Ning of Hong Kong at 52nd place out of 55. Duffy, however, was lapped on the bike leg and was disqualified before reaching the running portion or completing the event.

Ludwig Münchmeyer

Ludwig Johannes Herbert Martin Münchmeyer (June 2, 1885, Hoel, Province of Hanover – July 24, 1947) was an Evangelical German pastor known for antisemitism. He led an "antisemitic spa" on the island of Borkum. He won a libel suit against Bruno Weil, but enough of the allegations of loose morals and scandalous misconduct against him were confirmed that he was defrocked. He later acted as a prominent Nazi speaker after leaving the German National People's Party. He also propagandized for the Nazi Party in Weser-Ems.
Early life.
Ludwig Münchmeyer came from an old, Lower Saxonian family of pastors, which can be tracd back to Heinrich Münchmeyer (around 1654–1728), a tax official in Einbeck. He was the son of Carl Hans Wilhelm Ludwig Münchmeyer and Henriette Friederike Adelgunde Münchmeyer, née Brakebusch. In Rinteln he attended the gymnasium.
He studied Protestant theology in Erlangen, Leipzig and Göttingen and took the second theological examination in March 1911. On 17 June of the same year he was ordained. He was first employed as a seafarer's pastor in Cardiff in Great Britain. In March 1915 he became a military chaplain. He then became a military hospital chaplain in Hannover.

Bolivia at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Bolivia sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing, China. The South American country's delegation was the fifteenth Summer Olympic team and seventeenth overall Olympic team overall sent by the country. Bolivia's National Olympic Committee sent seven athletes–three women and four men–across five sports and seven distinct events. A substantial number of the athletes originated in southern Bolivian cities, most notably Santa Cruz de la Sierra. All athletes except for cyclist Horacio Gallardo finished their events, although no medals were won by the country at these Games (or at any Games up to this point, summer or winter). Trap shooter César Menacho was the Bolivian flag bearer at the ceremonies.
Background.
Bolivia is a landlocked, predominantly mountainous nation in central South America that is inhabited mainly by Amerindian peoples. The nation of 10 million people lies to the southwest of Brazil, to the northwest of Paraguay, to the north of Argentina and of Chile, and to the east of Peru. Bolivia was originally colonized by the Spanish, and broke away from the Spanish Empire in 1825. The nation endured a period of instability that consisted of nearly 200 coups between then and 1982, when a popularly elected democratic government came into power. The first Bolivian delegation to the Olympics appeared 46 years before the arrival of democracy in Bolivia, when two men competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Nazi Germany. However, Bolivian athletes did not return to the Olympics afterwards until the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. The size of the Bolivian delegation has increased steadily since that time, and has peaked several times—most notably at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, when 13 athletes arrived to represent their country across six sports. The first female Bolivian Olympian competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, USA. Bolivian athletes competed at fifteen Summer Olympic games (and seventeen Olympic games of any kind) by the end of the Beijing games, missing only 1948–1960 and 1980.
Seven athletes competed in the Beijing Olympics on Bolivia's behalf. More than half the delegation was more than 30 years old, with the eldest athlete being trap shooter César Menacho at age 43 and the youngest being 26 year old swimmer Miguel Navarro. Four of the athletes were male and three were female, and the athletes competed across five distinct events (track and field, cycling, shooting, swimming, weightlifting). In its history up to and including Beijing's Olympic games, there had been no Bolivian athlete who had medaled in any Olympic event. Menacho was the national flagbearer at the ceremonies.
Athletics.
Fadrique Ignacio Iglesias Mendizábal competed in the men's 800 meters races at Beijing while representing Bolivia. Born in Cochabamba, a major Bolivian city in the center of the country, Iglesias was 23 years old when he first competed in the Olympics at Athens, Greece in 2004 in the same event. During the qualification round of the men's 800 meters, which took place on August 20, Iglesias competed in the sixth heat against seven other athletes. He finished the race in 1:50.57, placing seventh in his heat. Yemen's Mohammed Al-Yafaee placed immediately behind Iglesias (1:54.82), while Canada's Achraf Tadili placed sixth (1:48.87) in a heat led by Morocco's Amine Laalou (1:47.86) and Uganda's Abraham Chepkirwok (1:47.93). Of the 58 athletes who finished the event, Fadrique Iglesias placed 53rd. He did not advance to later rounds.
Sonia Calizaya Huanca competed on Bolivia's behalf in the women's marathon, and was the only female Bolivian track athlete at the Beijing games. Born in the "de facto" Bolivian capital of La Paz, Calizaya competed in Beijing at the age of 32. She had not previously competed at any earlier Olympic games. During the course of the marathon, which took place on August 16, Calizaya competed against 81 other athletes. Of those, 68 finished. Calizaya finished the race in 2 hours, 45 minutes and 53 seconds, placing 59th out of the 69. In comparison, gold medalist Constantina Tomescu Dita of Romania finished the race in 2 hours, 26 minutes and 44 seconds, and 69th place finalist Oksana Sklyarenko of the Ukraine completed the marathon in 2 hours, 55 minutes and 39 seconds.
Cycling.
Horacio "Torpedo" Gallardo Burgos competed in the Beijing Olympics on Bolivia's behalf as its only road cyclist. He competed in the men's individual road race. Born in the southern town of San Bernardo de la Frontera de Tarija, Gallardo was 27 years old at the time of his competition in Beijing. Gallardo had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The August 8 competition included 143 runners, with 90 finishing the race. Horacio Gallardo was one of the 53 competitors who did not finish the marathon.
Shooting.
César David Menacho Flores was the sole Bolivian competitor in shooting events while at the Beijing Olympics. A competitor in men's trap shooting, Menacho was born in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and was 43 years old at the time of the competition in Beijing. Menacho had not previously competed in any Olympic events. On August 9, during the event's preliminary round, Menacho faced 34 other athletes. The preliminary round consisted of five rounds, with Menacho scoring 24; 22; 21; 18; and 21, respectively, during these rounds. His total point score was 106, placing Menacho in 34th place between last-place finalist Eric Ang of the Philippines and 33rd place finalist Alberto Fernandez of Spain at the 2008 Summer Olympics, both who finished with a score of 106. In comparison, the Czech Republic's gold medalist David Kostelecky finished the final round at 146 points.
Swimming.
Katerine Moreno de Quintanilla competed on Bolivia's behalf in the women's 50 meters freestyle. Born in the metropolis of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in the central-southern region of the country, Moreno first competed at the Olympics at age 14 in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. She competed in the women's 50 meters freestyle; 100 meters freestyle; 100 meters backstroke; and 100 meters breaststroke. She later qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in the women's 100 meters breaststroke; Moreno returned in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece in the same event. The Bolivian swimmer was 34 when she raced in Beijing, marking her fourth Olympic appearance and seventh Olympic competition. During the preliminary round, Moreno competed in the eight-person fourth heat. She finished fourth with a time of 29.05 seconds, placing ahead of Mongolia's Dashtserengiin Saintsetseg (29.63 seconds) and behind American Samoa's Virginia Farmer (28.82 seconds) in a heat led by Mozambique's Ximene Gomes (28.15 seconds) and Swaziland's Senele Dlamini (28.70 seconds). Of the 90 finishing athletes, Moreno placed 64th. She did not advance to later rounds.
Miguel Ángel Navarro competed on Bolivia's behalf as a swimmer in the men's 100 meters freestyle event. Born in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Navarro competed in Beijing at the age of 26. He had not previously competed at any Olympic games. During the course of the event's preliminary round, which took place on August 12, Navarro competed in the first heat against two other athletes. He completed the event in 56.96 seconds, placing second between first place heat finalist Emile Rony Bakale of the Republic of the Congo (55.08 seconds) and third place heat finalist Sofyan El Gidi of Libya (57.89 seconds). Overall, 64 competitors completed the event. Navarro ranked 63rd, and did not advance.
Weightlifting.
María Teresa Monasterio competed in the middleweight class (63 kilograms or less) of weightlifting on Bolivia's behalf during the Beijing Olympics. Monasterio was Bolivia's only weightlifter during these Olympics. Born in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Monasterio entered the Beijing competitions at the age of 38. The female competition for Monasterio's weight class took place on August 12 between 20 competitors. During snatches, the Bolivian successfully lifted 60 kilograms on her first attempt and 63 kilograms on her second, and unsuccessfully attempted 65 kilograms on her third. She then successfully lifted 75 kilograms and 78 kilograms in her first two clean and jerk attempts, and unsuccessfully attempted 80 kilograms on her third and final try. Her final score, the combination of her highest snatch and clean and jerk weights, was 141 kilograms. 17 athletes successfully finished, with the Bolivian athlete finishing last of those. Tunisia's Hanene Ourfelli ranked immediately ahead of Monasterio (175 kilograms), and Great Britain's Michaela Breeze scored ahead of her (185 kilograms). In comparison, gold medalist Pak Hyon Suk of North Korea lifted 241 kilograms.

Șopotu Nou () is a commune in Caraș-Severin County, western Romania with a population of 1456 people. It is composed of ten villages: Cârșa Roșie ("Kersia Rosie"), Driștie, Poienile Boinei, Ravensca (; , from 1911 to 1918 "Almásróna"), Răchita ("Rekettyő"), Stăncilova ("Sztancsilovapuszta"), Șopotu Nou, Urcu ("Urku"), Valea Răchitei ("Rakittapuszta") and Valea Roșie ("Rosievölgy").
Villages.
Ravensca.
Ravensca is one of six Czech-inhabited villages in Romania's Banat. It is located on a hill at an altitude of "ca." 750 m above sea level and about 7 km southeast of Șopotu Nou village. Of the six Czech villages in the Banat, Ravensca is located at the highest altitude and the best-preserved Czech language is spoken there. As a result of its considerable isolation, the speech is not overly influenced by Romanian and Serbo-Croatian. Ravensca is linked with the closest Czech villages of Gârnic (15 km away) and Bigăr (30 km away) by being decorated with the red mark designated by the Czech Tourists' Club. Local inhabitants make their living mainly in agriculture, electricity having been introduced as late as 1994.
Ravensca has the most scenic location of the Banat's Czech villages, making it a favourite destination of romantic travelers. However, life on the mountain range is very hard, particularly in winter, when the village is almost completely cut off from the rest of the world. This is perhaps the reason for the rapid decrease in residents.
The village was founded in 1827. In 1922, a Roman Catholic church of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary was built, being consecrated to St. Martin. In 1925 the village had 586 inhabitants; by 1991 the population had fallen to 235 (230 of whom were Czechs), dropping to slightly over 120 in 2002.

Limehurst Rural District

Limehurst was, from 1894 to 1954, a rural district in the administrative county of Lancashire, England.
History.
Ashton-under-Lyne Rural Sanitary District was created in 1872 and included parishes in both Cheshire and Lancashire. The Local Government Act 1894 redesignated rural sanitary districts as rural districts, and where they crossed county boundaries they were generally divided. Accordingly the area of Ashton RSD was divided with the Lancashire parishes forming Limehurst Rural District and the Cheshire parishes becoming Tintwistle Rural District.
Over time the rural district became increasingly urbanised, and it lost areas to surrounding boroughs and urban districts in 1914, 1935 and 1951. In 1954 the district was abolished, with its area passing to five neighbouring towns.
Parishes.
The rural district originally consisted of seven parishes:
Six of the parishes formed an area bounded to the north by Failsworth and Oldham and to the south by Ashton-under-Lyne, Mossley and Droylsden. The parish of Crossbank formed an exclave, lying to the north of Lees Urban District.
Contraction and abolition.
The rural district was altered as follows:

Dominica at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Dominica sent a delegation of eight people, including two athletes, to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Its appearance in Beijing marked the fourth time a delegation from Dominica participated in an Olympic games since its debut at the 1996 Olympic games, one of its smallest delegations in its history and the first Dominican delegation that did not include female athletes. Chris Lloyd ran for Dominica in the men's 200 meters and Erison Hurtault participated in the men's 400 meters. Neither advanced past the qualification rounds. Lloyd was also supposed to compete in the men's 400 meters, but did not participate in it. Track coach Jérôme Romain was the country's flag bearer at the Olympics.
Background.
Dominica is an island nation located in the far eastern rim of the Caribbean Sea that lis between the French colonies of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique to the south. The country's debut in the Olympics was in Atlanta during the 1996 Summer Olympics, and it has participated in every summer Olympics between then and the Beijing Olympics in 2008–numbering four in total. The largest delegation sent by Dominica was in 1996, and the size of its delegation decreased to four in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, then to two in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Dominica's Beijing delegation also only included two athletes, although its appearance at the Olympics marked the first Dominican delegation that included no women. As of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, Dominican athletes had not won any medals. Jerome Romain, the coach accompanying the Dominican delegation, was the nation's flagbearer at the ceremonies.
The delegation of Dominica in Beijing totaled eight people. Other than the two athletes, Chris Lloyd and Erison Hurtault, Dominican Olympic Committee president Rosanne Pringle, Chef de Mission Hubert "Mickey" Joseph, Dominican Olympic Committee secretary-general Lesley Ann Green, and Youth Olympians Attainea Toulon and William Moise were also included in the delegation, along with coach Jerome Romain. Lloyd qualified for both the men's 200 meters and men's 400 meter, ranking in the top ten in the world in the men's 200 meters at the time. Lloyd, however, did not end up participating in the men's 400 meters dash, and raced only in the men's 200 meters.
Athletics.
27 year old Chris Lloyd participated on Dominica's behalf at the Beijing Olympics in the men's 200 meters dash. Born in Houston, Texas, Lloyd's Olympic career began with his participation in the men's 400 meters dash, in which he competed while a 23 year old in the 2004 Athens games. During the 17 August qualification round, Lloyd was placed in the third heat. He completed the race in fifth place, finishing with a time of 20.90 seconds. In doing so, Lloyd defeated Uruguay's Heber Viera (20.93 seconds) but fell behind Slovenia's Matic Osovnikar (20.89 seconds). The leaders of Lloyd's heat included Great Britain's Marlon Devonish (20.49 seconds) and Saint Kitts and Nevis' Kim Collins (20.55 seconds). Overall, 62 athletes finished their races in the qualification round of the event. Lloyd placed 32nd. He did not advance to later rounds.
Erison Hurtault competed for Dominica in the men's 400 meters dash. In Beijing, Hurtault was the only Dominican participating in the event. Born in Matawan, a New Jersey suburb of New York, and attending Columbia University, Hurtault initially tried out for the United States Olympic team, but failed to qualify, before taking the berth offered to him by his parents' homeland. Hurtault was 23 at the time of his competition in Beijing, and had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the 17 August qualification round, the Dominican-American athlete was placed in the fourth heat. He finished in fourth place with a time of 46.10 seconds, displacing Uruguay's Andres Bayron Silva (46.32 seconds) but falling behind Jamaica's Ricardo Chambers (45.22 seconds). The leaders of Hurtault's heat included Great Britain's Martyn Rooney (45.00 seconds) and Australia's Sean Wroe (45.17 seconds). Overall, he ranked 34th out of the 55 athletes who completed the qualification round of the event. Hurtault did not advance to later rounds.

<doc id="18557327" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18557327" title="Tidelands">
Tidelands

Tidelands are the territory between the high and low water tide line of sea coasts, and lands lying under the sea beyond the low-water limit of the tide, considered within the territorial waters of a nation. The United States Constitution does not specify whether ownership of these lands rests with the federal government or with individual states. Originally little commercial value was attached to tidelands, so ownership was never firmly established, but the coastal states generally proceeded as if they were the owners. Some states, such as Mississippi, directly administer these lands under the public trust doctrine.
The question arose for federal nations whether the tidelands for formerly independent coastal states had been ceded to the federal union on admission, or retained. The admission of the former Republic of Texas as a state in the United States in 1845 stipulated that its tidelands remained the territory of Texas. This has been an issue for oil and natural gas leases and federally funded development that affects such tidelands.
For other states that were formerly independent, such as the Thirteen Colonies, there was no explicit retention of state sovereignty and the federal government had long asserted its own sovereignty over their tidelands.
20th century incidentals.
The value of tidelands increased when it became known that vast oil and natural gas deposits lay within their limits and that modern technology made retrieval of these minerals commercially profitable. The first offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico began production in 1938 in shallow water one mile (1.6 km) off the Louisiana coast; in 1947, a second well began to operate off the coast of Terrebonne Parish, also in Louisiana.
"United States v. California, 332 U.S. 19", was filed by the Federal government against California in 1946. On 23 June 1947, the Supreme Court of the United States decided against California. The decision meant the loss of untold millions of dollars in taxes and leasing fees by the states. The states whose tidelands were thought to contain minerals objected strongly to the decision.
The issue became important in the 1952 presidential campaign. The Republican candidate, Dwight D. Eisenhower, pledged legislation that would restore the tidelands to the states. Eisenhower won the election, and, in 1953, Congress passed two acts that fulfilled his campaign promise. The Submerged Lands Act extended state ownership to three geographical miles (almost exactly ) from their actual coastline, or further if a state could establish the existence of a boundary in judicial proceedings. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act gave the United States paramount rights from the point where state ownership leaves off to the point where international waters begin.
The 1953 acts did not end all controversy, however. The Submerged Lands Act, in particular, was so badly drawn up that state taxes and leasing fees had to be put in escrow, pending final resolution of the numerous lawsuits that emerged. The Supreme Court finally decided the issue on 31 May 1960, when it ruled that Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana owned the rights to the offshore lands for a distance of three geographical miles (), and Texas and Florida owned rights to tidelands within three marine leagues (), from their coastline boundaries ("United States v. States of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida"). In the case of Texas, the claim to special boundary limits had been recognized by Congress in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, which ended the Mexican–American War. The ruling for Florida was based on congressional approval of Florida's claims when the state re-entered the Union after the American Civil War.
Although the other Gulf states objected to what they considered preferential treatment for Florida and Texas, no new legislation resulted. In 1963, the United States Department of Justice settled the last of the tidelands controversies by ruling that the 1953 act gave control to the states of islands near the shore that were created after the states had been admitted to the Union.

ATS 2500 GT

The ATS 2500 GT is a sports car made by Italian company Automobili Turismo e Sport in Bologna. It was the first Italian and one of the first GT or sports car in the world to have a mid-engine layout. The group behind the ATS project consisted mainly of Ferrari defectors, where family troubles had created an uncomfortable working atmosphere for the personnel. ATS, intent on beating Ferrari on all fronts, also produced a Formula One car for 1963, "a ghastly mess, one of the most inept racing cars ever, and its appalling performances did not help the road car." Even noted driver Phil Hill was unable to provide ATS with any results on track.
The space frame 2500 GT was introduced in 1963 Paris Motor Show. Designed by Franco Scaglione and engineered by Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini the car was built only in limited numbers before investors withdrew financial support and the project collapsed. The car's drawings were later used for Count Volpi's (an early backer) failed Serenissima sportcars project. A Moreno Baldi attempted another revival of the ATS concept in 1970, and failed even more disastrously.
With its (210 bhp according to some) and of torque it was claimed to be capable of top speed . A competition version (ATS 2500 GTS) produced but never amounted to much. The coachbuilt was by Allemano, and the 5-speed transmission by Colotti.

Netherlands Antilles at the 2008 Summer Olympics

A delegation from the Netherlands Antilles competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. It was the fifteenth and final appearance of the Netherlands Antilles at the Olympic Games, as the territory was to be dissolved before the 2012 Summer Olympic games in London, during which the IOC decided that Dutch Antillean athletes would participate independently under the Olympic flag.
The Netherlands Antilles' delegation was composed of three athletes participating in three different sports: Rodion Davelaar in swimming, Philip Elhage in shooting, and Churandy Martina in track and field. Neither Davelaar or Elhage continued past the qualification rounds, but Martina reached the finals for the 100m and 200m dashes. Martina scored fourth place in the 100m dash and second place in the 200m dash (the latter behind Usain Bolt), but was disqualified after a controversial American-led protest.
Background.
The appearance of the Netherlands Antilles at the Beijing Olympics marked its thirteenth and final appearance. The Netherlands Antilles had consistently appeared at the Summer Olympics since the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, excluding two Olympic games that had been boycotted due to Soviet incursions in other countries. Churandy Martina was the flagbearer for the Netherlands Antilles at the closing and opening ceremonies for the 2008 Olympics.
Issues regarding debt and revenue-sharing within the Netherlands Antilles eventually led to the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into the Netherlands. Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the Netherlands Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of the Netherlands Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the Netherlands in the Netherlands Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the Netherlands Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.
Athletics.
Churandy Martina was the only Dutch Antillean to participate in track and field in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He participated in two events: The 100m dash and the 200m dash.
100 m dash.
On 14 August, Martina completed round one of qualifications for the 100m dash at 10.35 seconds. This placed Martina at first in his heat (Heat 10). He ranked twenty-seventh in the round, tying with Walter Dix from the United States and Andrew Hinds from Barbados. In round two on 14 August, Martina ran the 100m dash in 9.99 seconds, tying for second with Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago, and falling behind Usain Bolt of Jamaica by 0.07 seconds. Martina advanced because of his score, and was first in his heat on 15 August, running 9.99 seconds. Churandy Martina advanced to semifinals and ran the 100m dash in 9.94 seconds, scoring third in his heat (behind Thompson and Jamaica's Asafa Powell) and fourth overall (also behind Bolt). He also ranked fourth in the finals, falling 0.02 seconds short of bronze medalist Walter Dix's time. Consequently, he did not medal in the event.
200 m dash.
Martina ranked third in his heat in the 17 August qualifications for the 200m dash, finishing the event in 20.78 seconds and falling behind Azerbaijan's Ramil Guliyev and Nigeria's Obinna Metu. Overall, Martina ranked in twenty-fourth place, but advanced. During round two of qualifications on 17 August, Martina ran the 200m dash in 20.42 seconds, second place in the heat before Antigua and Barbuda's Brendan Christian. In round two, Martina ranked tenth place, tying with the United States' Shawn Crawford. Martina ran the 200m in 20.11 seconds during semifinals, ranking first in his heat and second overall behind Usain Bolt. He then advanced to the finals round.
Martina's participation in the 200m finals round was controversial. Martina came in second place to Usain Bolt, completing the event in 19.82 seconds over Bolt's world-record-breaking 19.80 second time. However, when American would-be bronze medalist Wallace Spearmon was disqualified for running outside of his lane, the American coaches reviewed video records of the race and found that Martina had done the same. The United States filed a protest against the Netherlands Antilles. The Dutch Antillean Olympic committee argued that the challenge was invalid, having been filed after the 30-minute post-race deadline, but Martina was disqualified from receiving the silver medal anyway. Shawn Crawford of the United States, who originally finished the race in fourth place, was given the silver medal, and Walter Dix was given the bronze medal in place of Spearmon.
Shortly after the 2008 Olympics, Crawford competed against Martina again in a meet in Zurich, Switzerland. At a hotel during the course of the meet, Crawford left the silver medal for Martina, believing that Martina deserved the medal more than he.
Shooting.
Philip Elhage was the only Dutch Antillean to participate in shooting events at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He participated in the 10m air pistol. During 9 August, the 10m air pistol event was held in Beijing, with forty-nine competitors. Elhage scored 566.0, ranking forty-fifth. Elhage scored the same as Yusuf Dikec from Turkey. Overall, Elhage's score fell 122.2 short of Pang Wei of China, who won the gold medal in the event.
Swimming.
Rodion Davelaar was the only Dutch Antillean athlete to participate in swimming in the 2008 Summer Olympics. He participated in the 50m freestyle. He was the recipient of a 2008 IOC Olympic Scholarship, which provided Davelaar with training facilities, a specialized coach and insurance. Additionally, the Scholarship covered costs for lodging, checkups, and Davelaar's entry for and participation in qualification competitions for the 2008 Olympics.
During the 14 August preliminaries, Davelaar swam the 50m freestyle in 24.21 seconds. He ranked second in Heat 6, falling behind Yellow Yei Yah of Nigeria by 0.21 seconds. Overall, Davelaar ranked fifty-seventh out of ninety-seven swimmers. Davelaar's time was 2.75 seconds slower than French swimmer Amaury Leveaux during his performance in the 14 August preliminaries, who ranked first and set an Olympic record in the preliminary session. Davelaar did not advance past the 14 August preliminaries.

I Love You Da

I Love You Da is a 2002 Tamil film directed by Raajadurai. The film featured Raju Sundaram and Simran in the lead roles with Raghuvaran and Prakash Raj in supporting roles. The film which had music composed by Bharathwaj, released in November 2002 to poor reviews.
Plot.
Raghuvaran pays Indian cricketers to lose the match so he can bet on the Pakistan team to make a lot of money. One day Raghuvaran's daughter Simran was sad that India never wins any matches so Raghuvaran just for one match lets India win. One time India loses and a small boy commits suicide seeing this Raju Sundaram works hard to become a cricket player and make India win for once. He is stopped by Raghuvaran but wins and becomes a cricket player. Raju Sundaram goes to Pakistan to win but is stopped by Raghuvaran but he is killed by his own daughter Simran. Eventually India wins but Simran goes to jail. She comes out and is reunited with Raju Sundaram.
Production.
The film marked the debut of choreographer Raju Sundaram as the protagonist in films, after he had appeared in item numbers as well as a supporting role in Shankar's "Jeans". The director of the film was to be Raajadurai, who had been an erstwhile assistant of director Manoj Kumar during the making of "Vaanavil". When the film began production in late 2001, a Telugu version titled "I Love You Raa" was also planned. Actress Simran, Raju Sundaram's girlfriend during the period, was signed to play the female lead role. The couple however split during the production of the film. Early reports suggested that noted South Indian cricketers including Sadagoppan Ramesh, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid and Javagal Srinath may feature as themselves in the film, but this proved to be untrue.
Despite the completion of the film's scenes by early 2002, production delays meant that the film faced a belated release at the end of the year.
Release.
The film gained unanimously poor reviews upon release, with Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu stating that the film "falls flat due to identifiable reasons — the director has not done his homework properly, the dialogue makes you squirm at times, none of the actors seems involved in the role taken up and to top it all the lead pair fails to make even a slight impression".
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of the film was composed by Bharathwaj.

Saint Lucia at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Saint Lucia sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The 2008 Saint Lucian team included four athletes that competed in two sports: swimming and athletics. Of these four athletes, Danielle Beaubrun, at age 18, was the youngest of the competitors. Dominic Johnson, at age 32, was the oldest, and was the only man sent as part of the 2008 delegation; additionally, Johnson was the only Saint Lucian athlete in the 2008 delegation who had previously participated in the Olympics. 
None of the four athletes advanced past the qualifying stages, and thus did not win any medals. Evans ranked thirtieth overall in the qualifying round for javelin; Johnson also ranked thirtieth overall in the pole vault qualifying round; and Spencer ranked twenty-seventh in the qualifying round for high jump. Additionally, Beaubrun ranked forty-second in the swimming qualifying stages.
Background.
The Saint Lucia Olympic Committee sent President Richard Peterkin, Minister of Youth and Sports Lenard Montoute, Chief de Mission Alfred Emmanuel, Coach Henry Bailey, and Coach Karen Beaubrun to Beijing alongside the four-person athletic delegation. Saint Lucia was the 67th nation in line at the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which high jumper Levern Spencer was the flagbearer. Saint Lucians were unable to view the 7:00 am opening ceremony because of issues with the local cable provider.
Athletics.
Three of Saint Lucia's four athletes competed in athletics: Dominic Johnson, Lavern Spencer, and Erma-Gene Evans. Johnson, at age 32, was the oldest of Saint Lucia's athletes to participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics.
Erma-Gene Evans participated in athletics as a javelin thrower. The 2008 Summer Olympics was her Olympic debut. Evans moved forward through two rounds after qualifying under the B standard during her event on 18 August 2008, but did not rank in the third qualifying round. With a best mark distance of 56.27, Evans ranked thirtieth overall. She did not advance.
Dominic Johnson participated in athletics as a pole vaulter, returning to the Olympics for his third time; Johnson had previously participated as a pole vaulter (and, at one time, a relay runner) on behalf of Saint Lucia in the 2000 Summer Olympics and 1996 Summer Olympics. Johnson flew to San Diego days before the competition cutoff and made the qualifying preliminary height for the Olympics shortly after winning a silver medal at the Central American and Caribbean Championships in Cali, Columbia. Johnson's event took place on 20 August 2008. With a height of 5.30 metres, Johnson did not qualify, although he tied for seventeenth place in his qualifying group. As such, he did not advance. Johnson tied with the Czech pole vaulter Štěpán Janáček for thirtieth place overall.
Levern Spencer participated in athletics as a high jumper, making her first appearance in the Olympics. Spencer trained with Coach Wayne Norton of the University of Georgia to hone her skills in the time preceding her performance in the Olympics. Levern Spencer's personal best time has been compared to medal winners in the event from the 2004 Summer Olympics. Spencer's best height cleared was 1.85, placing fourteenth in Qualifying Group B. However, during her event on 20 August 2008, Spencer placed twenty-seventh overall, and did not advance.
Swimming.
Danielle Beaubrun was the only Saint Lucian swimmer to participate in the Beijing Olympics. She was the youngest member of the Saint Lucian delegation, at age 18. The 2008 Summer Olympics served as Beaubrun's Olympic debut. Beaubrun did not initially qualify for Olympic standards. However, because Saint Lucia had no naturally qualifying swimmers, the country was invited by FINA to send two swimmers to the Olympics, granted the swimmer had participated in the 2007 World Championships. Beaubrun met this criterion, and was selected for this reason. At the time, Beaubrun was enrolled at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida and trained with coach Sergio Lopez. 
The event in which Beaubrun participated was the 100 meter breaststroke. This event took place on 10 August 2008. In the second heat of the qualifying round, Beaubrun scored third, with a time of 1:12.85. However, overall, Danielle Beaubrun ranked forty-second, and, as a result, did not advance.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The year's team included two athletes engaged in track and field events (Kineke Alexander and Jared Lewis), and was accompanied by the team coach, manager, and chaperone. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' appearance in Beijing marked its sixth consecutive Olympic appearance since its 1988 debut in Seoul, South Korea, and its smallest delegation to date. Alexander bore the flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the opening ceremony and neither athlete medaled in their events or advanced to later rounds.
Background.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines debuted in the Olympic Games at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and, as of 2008, has participated in every edition since. The Beijing Games marked the smallest Vincentian delegation in the country's history, the size having declined over the years from its largest delegation of eight participants at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. At the conclusion of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' team has yet to medal in an event. The delegation arrived in Beijing on 28 July 2008, and stayed in the Olympic Village for the duration of their time in China. The Vincentians arrived early, three days after the Village itself opened, to make adjusting to the new environment easier. The delegation was accompanied by coach Gideon Labban; team manager Leroy Llewellyn; and chaperone Jacintha Ballantyne. Kineke Alexander was the flagbearer at the opening ceremony, leading Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the 64th nation in line.
Athletics.
The athletes competing on behalf of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines competed in track and field. Kineke Alexander participated in the women's 400 m sprint, while Jared Lewis took part in the men's 100 m sprint. Neither medaled or advanced to subsequent rounds.
Mississauga Track and Field Club member Jared Lewis qualified for the men’s 100 m sprint. At the Beijing Olympics, the first round of Lewis’ event took place on 14 August. Lewis was placed in Heat 3, competing against athletes such as Trinidad and Tobago’s Richard Thompson, who would later win silver in the event. Lewis ran his event in 11.00 seconds, ranking seventh among of eight competitors, 0.29 seconds ahead of Kiribati’s Rabangaki Nawai and 0.54 seconds slower than Indonesia’s Suryo Agung Wibowo. Thompson, who took first place in the heat, was 0.76 seconds faster than Lewis. Overall, Lewis tied Danny D'Souza of the Seychelles for 63rd place out of 80 people and did not advance to the second round, which took place on the same day.
University of Iowa student Kineke Alexander qualified for the 400 m sprint, an event in which she earned eight all-American honors during college competitions. Her participation in the Beijing Olympics marked her Olympic debut. At the Games Alexander competed in the first round of the event on 16 August. She was placed in Heat 6 and ranked fourth, completing the race in 52.87 seconds. She was 0.01  seconds faster than Grenada's Trish Bartholomew (5th place), 0.10  seconds slower than Sudan's Nawal El Jack (3rd place), and 1.35  seconds slower than heat leader Novelene Williams of Jamaica. Overall, in the first round, Alexander ranked 32 out of 50 competitors, finishing just ahead of Bartholomew and India's Mandeep Kaur and just behind Poland's Monika Bejnar. The overall round one leader, the United States' Sanya Richards, ran 2.33 seconds faster than Alexander. Alexander did not advance to the semifinal round, as she was neither in the top three places in her given heat nor in the top three fastest of those who did fall below third place in their heats.

Uni-Systems

Uni-Systems, LLC is a design, construction, and consultation engineering firm located in Minneapolis, Minnesota specializing in kinetic architecture, or movable, mechanized structures designed to adapt to individual structures’ needs. The firm has become particularly recognized for its design and installation of retractable roof systems on various sports stadiums across the United States; Uni-Systems has been involved in the construction of five of the seven sports stadiums incorporating retractable roofs in North America since 1999.
The company was founded in 1968 by Cyril Silberman, CEO, and began extensive work within the aerospace industry including the design and installation of hangar doors, landing gear elevator platforms, empennage stands, and the firm’s patented Uni-Dock. Clients of Uni-Systems in the aerospace industry include American Airlines, SkyVenture, Boeing, Canadian Air, the United States Air Force, and El Al Israel Airlines.
Retractable roofs.
Though it is not the only product Uni-Systems has delivered to clients, the company has become recognized as the "leader in retractable roofs." The firm's work with stadiums began with Minute Maid Park (formerly Enron Field), when they were contracted to work on the stadium's retractable roof with the architectural company Populous (then called HOK Sport). Along with the retractable roof, Uni-Systems also designed and installed the Squeeze Play feature, and the custom ornamental train that runs along an outfield wall at the stadium. Minute Maid Park gave credence to Uni-Systems as a successful provider of retractable roof mechanization systems, and the firm has become involved in numerous projects.
Along with the design and installation of retractable roofs, Uni-Systems helps develop custom control systems for operating mechanized components. In the case of Reliant Stadium, Uni-Systems worked with General Electric to control the bi-parting stadium roof using the GE Fanuc Series 90-70 Programmable Logic Controller, which provides a simple user-interface to control the roof, as well as detailed diagnostic resources designed to identify any problems in the mechanization system. Uni-Systems is also able to connect remotely to clients' systems to help run operations, perform maintenance, or identify problems in extreme cases.
The retractable skylight over the 470-ft-long retail concourse of Salt Lake City's City Creek Mall consists of two independent sections, one 230 ft and the other 240 ft long and each 58 ft wide. The retractable motion was achieved through three opposing glass-covered arched panels that cantilever across the 55.5-ft-wide concourse. Each panel has three plate box "ribs" with a 12.5-ft upturned back-span. The 80-ton skylight opens or closes in five minutes. City Creek Mall expects to have the roof open 70% of the time.

Pseudallescheria boydii

Pseudallescheria boydii is a species of fungus classified under Ascomycota. It is associated with some forms of eumycetoma and maduromycosis. The asexual form of this organism is named "Scedosporium apiospermum".
This fungus killed three athletes injured in the 1997 Maccabiah Games when at the opening ceremony a bridge collapsed into the Yarkon River.
Treatment of infections with "P. boydii" is complicated by resistance to many standard antifungal agents that are usually used for filamentous fungi.

The nation has participated in the Olympics since the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and has appeared at every Summer Olympics since then with the exception of the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, when it joined Jamaica and Barbados in a political union called the West Indies Federation. Overall, Trinidad and Tobago had participated in eighteen Olympic games (15 Summer Olympics and 3 Winter Olympics) between its 1948 debut and its appearance at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and its fifteenth Olympic game since its independence, which was in 1962.

Chad at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Chad sent a delegation of two athletes to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China: Moumi Sébergué, who competed in the men's 100 meters, and Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert, who competed in the women's 100 meters and also bore the Chadian flag during ceremonies. The appearance of this delegation marked the tenth appearance of Chad at the Summer Olympics at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and its seventh appearance since its Olympic hiatus between 1976 and 1980. Both Sébergué and Ndikert ranked seventh in their respective heats and did not advance past the qualification round. As of the end of the Beijing Olympics, there have been no medalists from Chad.
Background.
Chad is a landlocked country in Africa whose northern region lies within the eastern reaches of the Sahara Desert and whose southern region lies within the eastern portion of the Sahel. It borders Libya to the south, Niger to the east, Sudan to the west, and the Central African Republic to the north. Chad was originally part of French West Africa until 1960, when it declared independence. Some four years later, the former French colony made its début at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. For the next three decades, Chad became embroiled in civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and upheavals by Sudanese-backed rebels; the civil war ended in 1990, although rebel threats had persisted between then and 2008. During Chad's greatest era of instability, athletes from the country did not attend the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR, although delegations were sent to all other games between 1964 and 2008.
The largest Chadian delegation to reach the Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain; each time, Chad's National Olympic Committee sent six athletes. During the 1992 games, the NOC sent the nation's first female Olympian. Since then (and up to the Beijing games), at least one woman has been a part of the Chadian delegation. The smallest contingency of Chadian Olympians occurred during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when only Brahim Abdoulaye competed on the country's behalf. The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes—one man (30 year old Moumi Sébergué) and one woman (15 year old Hinikissa Albertine Ndikert), both participants in track events. Ndikert was Chad's flagbearer at the ceremonies, Up to and including the Beijing games, there has yet to have been a medalist from Chad.
Athletics.
Competitors in athletics events could qualify for the next round of competition in two ways. Qualifying by right was posting a high result in their own heat, and qualifying by result was posting a high result in overall standings. Ranks shown are thus those within each heat, not in overall standings.
Moumi Sébergué represented Chad at the Beijing Olympics in the men's 100 meters dash. Born in 1977, Sébergué first participated in the Olympics at age 22 when he raced in the men's 100 meters at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, placing seventh in his qualification heat and not progressing to later rounds. He did not attend the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, but returned to the Olympics at Beijing at the age of 30. During the course of the August 14 races in his event, when the qualification round took place, Sébergué competed in the tenth heat against seven other athletes. He finished the race in 11.14 seconds, placing seventh in the heat ahead of Tuvalu's Okinali Tinilau (11.48 seconds) and behind Gabon's Wilfried Bingangoye (10.87 seconds) in a heat led by the Netherlands Antilles' Churandy Martina (10.35 seconds) and Japan's Naoki Tsukahara (10.39 seconds). Of the 80 athletes who participated in the events, the Chadian sprinter ranked 70th. He did not advance to later rounds.
Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert competed on Chad's behalf as the national delegation's only female athlete at the Beijing games. She participated in the women's 100 meters dash, and was 15 years old at the time of the competition. Ndikert had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the qualification round of the event, which took place on August 15, Ndikert competed in the eighth heat against seven other athletes. She finished the race in 12.55 seconds, placing seventh; she defeated the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Franka Magali (12.57 seconds) and fell behind Papua New Guinea's Mae Koime (11.68 seconds) in a heat led by Nigeria's Damola Osayomi (11.13 seconds) and the Bahamas' Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie (11.17 seconds). Of the event's 64 competitors, Ndikert finished in 64th place. She did not advance to later rounds.
