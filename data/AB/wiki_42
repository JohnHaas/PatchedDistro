Abuko Nature Reserve

Abuko National Park is a nature reserve in the Gambia lying south of the town of Abuko. It is a popular tourist attraction and was the country's first designated wildlife reserve.
History.
The area was first accorded some measure of protection in 1916 when the Lamin Stream, which flows through the reserve, was fenced to form a water collection point. The enclosure of the stream saw an increase in the stock of wildlife and flora in the forest. 
In 1967 wildlife officer Eddie Brewer and his daughter Stella Marsden visited the area and realised the conservation importance of the forest and its wildlife. Brewer made a request to the government for the area to be protected. In 1968 the Department of Wildlife, now the Gambia Department of Parks and Wildlife Management was established at the reserve.
Flora.
The flora consists of a typical savanna and gallery forest landscape. Typical trees, up to thirty feet high, are: oil palm, mahogany, iroko and anthocleista procera.
Fauna.
There are a three primate species: vervet monkeys, red colobus monkeys and patas monkeys. Other mammals include antelope, squirrel, porcupine, African palm civets, mongooses, galagos, and several types of rodents, including cane rats.
Among the reptiles at the park are monitor lizard, Nile crocodile, dwarf crocodile, spitting cobra, black cobra, python, puff adder and green mamba. More than 270 bird species have been recorded in the forest. There are also numerous butterflies and moths. 
At one end of the site are several enclosures which serve as an orphanage for needy animals, including an enclosure in which a pack of hyenas is held.

Kiang West National Park

Kiang West National Park is one of the largest and most important wildlife reserves in the Gambia. It was declared a national park in 1987 and is managed by the Gambia Department of Parks and Wildlife Management.
Geography.
The park covers an area of 11,526 hectares, and is located on the south bank of the Gambia River, in the Lower River Division in the Kiang West District. The park is located about away from Tendaba village, from the Gambian capital city Banjul, and from the Gambian coastline. The Gambia River marks the park's northern boundary. Three "bolons" (creeks)—the Jarin, Jali, and Nganingkoi—divide the park's interior into three sections. The park is unpopulated, with villages located close outside its borders.
Most of the park is located on a plateau of low altitude, and is mostly Guinea savanna and dry deciduous woodland, and it also has tidal flats and mangrove creeks.
Flora.
Vegetation types in the park include Guinean savanna and dry deciduous woodland. The park's tree species include the baobab ("Adansonia digitata"), red acacia ("Acacia seyal"), "Pterocarpus erinaceus", "Ceiba pentandra", "Terminalia macroptera", "Prosopis africana", and Ficus species. Grasses in the park include "Andropogon".
Fauna.
The park is an important area for Gambian wildlife, as individuals of most of its remaining mammal species are found within it. These mammals include the African clawless otter ("Aonyx capensis"), Bushbuck ("Tragelaphus s. scriptus"), Caracal ("Caracal caracal"), Common duiker ("Sylvicapra grimmia"), Leopard ("Panthera pardus pardus"), Marsh Mongoose ("Atilax paludinosus"), Serval ("Leptailurus serval"), Sitatunga ("Tragelaphus spekii"), Spotted hyena ("Crocuta crocuta"), Warthogs ("Phacochoerus africanus"), and West African manatee ("Trichechus sengalensis"). West African manatees and Humpback Dolphins are sometimes observed in the Jarin "bolon".
The park's reptile species include the African python ("Python sebae"), Bell’s Hinged Tortoise ("Kinixys belliana nogueyi"), Nile crocodile ("Crocodylus niloticus"), Nile monitor ("Varanus niloticus"), Puff adder ("Bitis arietans"), Royal python ("Python regius"), and Spitting cobra ("Naja nigricollis").
The park has more than 300 bird species, more than half of all the bird species that have been recorded in the Gambia. Some of the park's bird species have a very local distribution and are rarely observed in other locations in the Gambia. There are 21 birds of prey, including eagle, falcon, harrier, hawk, and vulture species. There are quite a large number of birds of prey in the park during the dry season. Other bird species in the park include ten Kingfisher species, the Ground-hornbill, and the threatened Brown-necked Parrot ("Poicephalus robustus fuscicollis"), which breeds in the park's mangroves. Other bird species include White-fronted Black-chat ("Myrmecocichla albifrons"), Dorst's Cisticola ("Cisticola dorsti"), Burchell's Courser ("Cursorius rufus"), Brown-rumped Bunting ("Emberiza affinis") and Chestnut-crowned Sparrow-weaver ("Plocepasser superciliosus"), which have restricted distributions in the Gambia. The Bateleur ("Terathopius ecaudatus"), a short tailed eagle species, is the park's official symbol. The Bateleur hunts for sandgrouse and pigeons in the park, and is most often seen there from July to September.
Conservation and tourism.
Local people are permitted to gather a small amount of firewood and forest products, and to cultivate some rice within the park boundaries. Annual forest fires badly affect the park. In 2001, a large fire burned through the length of the park for two days.
The park receives few tourists. November to January are the best months to visit. The park's headquarters and tourist bungalows are located at Dumboto. Tendaba Camp in Tendaba village has been open since the 1970s and is the most established base for trips to the national park. Chalets in this camp provide accommodation for tourists. The park's road system is underdeveloped. Tubabkollon Point, located near a sandy beach beside the Gambia River in the northeast of the park, is a good place for visitors to watch wildlife. The park is becoming well known as a good place for birdwatching.

Niumi National Park

Niumi National Park is a National Park in The Gambia.
General information.
The Niumi National Park occupies the coastal strip of the Gambia north of the river. The park is approximately 4,940 ha (49.4 square km) in extent. Apart from being an important fish breeding ground, it constitutes one of the last untouched mangrove stands on the West African Coast north of the equator. The more terrestrial parts of the park contain an interesting cross section of threatened regional fauna and a wide diversity of habitat types. The international character of the Delta complex as one ecological entity with vital and incalculable environmental value to the region and its people, prompted the Gambia and Senegal to recognise the need to protect this area. The Gambia declared its portion of the Delta as a national park in 1986, comprising the southern part of the coastal wetlands and mangroves of the Saloum Delta. The park is contiguous with Senegal’s Delta du Saloum National Park and Biosphere Reserve.
Areas of Interest.
Niumi National Park encompasses the island of Jinack which is separated from the mainland by the narrow Niji Bolon. The island is mainly low-lying with extensive areas of coastal dune woodlands, salt water marsh dominated by Tamarisk and mangrove fringing the bolon. The mainland section of the park incorporates dry woodland and grassland savannah which is on a raised laterite plateau. This plateau is dissected by the Masarinko Bolon which is mangrove lined and backed by salt-pan to the escarpment edge. West African Manatee’s occur within the bolon and were previously hunted for meat. The African Clawless Otter (Aonyx Capensis) is also found in the Masarinko Bolon but as with the manatee it is shy and difficult to observe.
Habitat Type - Mangroves.
Mangroves can be defined as a tropical swamp forest growing in salt or brackish water. Mangroves are usually found in the tidal zone in sheltered places such as estuaries and coastal lagoons. In the Gambia mangroves border the river all the way up to Kaur - 150 km up river - which is about as far as the river is influenced by salt sea water. In the coastal area the mangroves are comparatively low, but upriver they usually consist of trees 15–20 km high.
Those species that make up the mangrove forests need special adaptations to be able to grow on an unstable soil that the tide threatens to wash away and to be able to survive the constant changes in water level and salinity. Common adaptations are seeds that germinate while the fruit is still attached to the mother plant (vivipary), leathery leaves to minimise evaporation, stilt or prop roots to give a better foothold and breathing roots and air channels to provide the underground parts with oxygen. Mangroves are extremely important in preventing erosion. They also have been utilised by certain nationally rare e.g. sitatunga, African Clawless Otter and West African Manatee.
Avi-Fauna.
Niumi National Park is home to a large diversity of resident bird species and also is an important site for European Migratory birds. A bird ringing programme has been in operation on Jinack Island since 1994 and has added numerous new species to the parks bird list. A large variety of warblers (17 species) have been found to use the island as a stop-over and feeding site both on the journey south and on their return north. The warblers are difficult to distinguish in the field due to their subtle plumage characteristics and generally skulking behaviour. The shallow offshore waters provide excellent feeding conditions for terns, gulls and other piscivorous species. which roost in large numbers off Buniadu Point. The mangrove and tidal flats are rich in waders, many of which are seasonal migrants but some, such as the white-fronted plover, nest on the dune fringe. Harriers are frequently encountered quartering the area during the European winter months.
Fauna.
Leopard,Spotted Hyena and a variety of smaller carnivores are found on the island which feed on oribi, bohor, reedbuck, primates and carrion. Hyenas often forage the shoreline looking for dead fish. Crocodiles occur in the seasonally flooded lagoons and swamps, retreating to semi-permanent waterholes as the dry season progresses and excavating burrows several metres long when these are also dry. Green turtles nest along the coastal strip, coming ashore on moonless nights to lay their eggs. In addition to supporting a complex of fauna and avifauna of great scientific interest, the area possesses one of the world’s rarer mammalian speceies - the West African Manatee and also an endangered member of the otter family - the African Clawless Otter. Humpback dolphin, Nile crocodile, Bush Duiker and Kob also occur in the area.

River Gambia National Park

River Gambia National Park is a national park in the Gambia.
Topography.
Established in 1978, River Gambia National Park is located in Niamina East district of Central River Division. It lies on the left bank of the Gambia River. The park includes the Baboon Islands archipelago, which consists of one large and four small islands. The national park is not open to the public.
River Gambia National Park is adjacent to Nyassang Forest Park. On some maps, the two parks are represented together as one area.
Flora.
The vegetation on the flat Baboon Islands is typical of a tropical rainforest in the form of a riparian forest.
Fauna.
Since 1979, River Gambia National Park is site of a chimpanzee-reintroduction project, conducted by the "Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project" (CRP) under the direction of Stella Marsden (daughter of Eddie Brewer). Chimpanzees confiscated from the illegal animal trade are reintroduced into the wild in the park. Marsden was awarded the Order of the British Empire for her work. Prior to 1979, the primates were raised in Abuko Nature Reserve. Today, several chimpanzee groups live unmolested by humans on the three largest river islands (435 ha, 77 ha und 53 ha). As of July 2006, there are 77 specimens. In the wild, chimpanzees became extinct in the Gambia in the early 20th century.
For the protection of the animals and visitors, entry onto the islands is not permitted, as chimpanzees can be highly aggressive towards humans. Exceptions are possible only with governmental approval. Even travel by boat around the islands was drastically reduced in 1998. In the past, some attempted to steal chimpanzees from the park.
Apart from the Common Chimpanzee ("Pan troglodytes verus"), River Gambia National Park is also home to the Guinea Baboon ("Papio papio"), Green Monkey ("Chlorocebus sabaeus"), Western Red Colobus ("Piliocolobus badius"), and marmosets ("Callithrix"). Other mammals include the prolific warthog ("Phacochoerus africanus") and some hippopotamuses ("Hippopotamus amphibius"), which have become rare in the Gambia. In addition, the park is home to the aardvark ("Orycteropus afer senegalensis"), Honey Badger ("Mellivora capensis"), Serval ("Leptailurus serval brachyura"), Haussa Genet ("Genetta thierryi"), African Clawless Otter ("Aonyx capensis"), and West African Manatee ("Trichechus senegalensis").
Of the antelopes, there is the Bushbuck ("Tragelaphus scriptus"), Maxwell's Duiker ("Cephalophus maxwellii"), and Common Duiker ("Sylvicapra grimmia"). Reptiles are likewise plentiful, and include the Nile Crocodile ("Crocodylus niloticus"), snakes, and lizards. The bird life is equally species-rich.

Midway is an unincorporated community rural community in Washington County, Oregon, United States. It is located on Oregon Route 219 about west of Scholls. The area is the halfway point between Hillsboro to the north and Sherwood to the southeast, so it became known as Midway. Midway has a large plant nursery business, a bar and grill and a rural fire station.
Midway's 1912 former one-room schoolhouse, closed in 1946, has been preserved as a private residence. Before being converted into a home, it served as a lodge for the Odd Fellows and Rebekahs. When the school closed, Midway School District merged with the Jacktown, Groner and Kinton school districts to form the Groner School District, which along with other small districts such as Farmington View later merged into the Hillsboro School District.

McIntyre Grove is a sequoia grove in southern California and is part of the Belknap complex along with Wheel Meadow Grove and the smaller, compact Carr Wilson, or Bear Creek Grove. 
This grove complex offers beautiful trails through old-growth sequoias along Bear Creek and the Tule River. It is easy to get to by car throughout the year by paved road. The grove is about .There are several trails through this grove, including Forest Trail 31E30 and 31E31. Forest Trail 31E30 goes through the heart of the grove along the river and can be started at Belknap or Quaking Aspen campgrounds. You can stop and fish the Tule River along this trail. 
The Patriarch Tree in the main grove area has been described as a monstrous umbrella, it is very short for a sequoia, but has a trunk almost as massive as the General Sherman tree yet it only ranks in as the 40th largest giant sequoia in the world. Two other large sequoias in this complex are the Gutless Goliath and the Near Gutless Tree.
Noteworthy trees.

Shapiro's lemma

In mathematics, especially in the areas of abstract algebra dealing with group cohomology or relative homological algebra, Shapiro's lemma, also known as the Eckmann–Shapiro lemma, relates extensions of modules over one ring to extensions over another, especially the group ring of a group and of a subgroup. It thus relates the group cohomology with respect to a group to the cohomology with respect to a subgroup. Shapiro's lemma is named after Arnold Shapiro, who proved it in 1961; however, Beno Eckmann had discovered it earlier, in 1953.
Statement for rings.
Let "R" → "S" be a ring homomorphism, so that "S" becomes a left and right "R"-module. Let "M" be a left "S"-module and "N" a left "R"-module. By restriction of scalars, "M" is also a left "R"-module.
See . The projectivity conditions can be weakened into conditions on the vanishing of certain Tor- or Ext-groups: see .
Statement for group rings.
When "H" is a subgroup of finite index in "G", then the group ring "R"["G"] is finitely generated projective as a left and right "R"["H"] module, so the previous applies in a simple way. Let "M" be a finite dimensional representation of "G" and "N" a finite dimensional representation of "H". In this case, the module "S" ⊗"R" "N" is called the induced representation of "N" from "H" to "G", and "R""M" is called the restricted representation of "M" from "G" to "H". One has that:
When "n" = 0, this is called Frobenius reciprocity for completely reducible modules, and Nakayama reciprocity in general. See , which also contains these higher versions of the Mackey decomposition.
Statement for group cohomology.
Specializing "M" to be the trivial module produces the familiar Shapiro's lemma. Let "H" be a subgroup of "G" and "N" a representation of "H". For "N""G" the induced representation of "N" from "H" to "G" using the tensor product, and for H* the group homology:
Similarly, for "N""G" the co-induced representation of "N" from "H" to "G" using the Hom functor, and for H* the group cohomology:
When "H" is finite index in "G", then the induced and coinduced representations coincide and the lemma is valid for both homology and cohomology.

The Cold Moon

The Cold Moon is a crime thriller novel written by Jeffery Deaver. It is the seventh book in the Lincoln Rhyme series, and also introduces CBI agent Kathryn Dance, who would get her own series of books.
It's the night of the full Cold Moon—the month of December according to the lunar calendar. A young man is found dead in lower Manhattan, the first in a series of victims of a man calling himself the Watchmaker. This killer's obsession with time drives him to plan the murders with the precision of fine timepieces, and the victims die prolonged deaths while an eerie clock ticks away their last minutes on earth. Lincoln Rhyme, Amelia Sachs and the rest of the crew are tapped to handle the case and stop the Watchmaker and his partner, Vincent Reynolds, a repulsive character with a special interest in the female victims of the killer. Amelia is not only Lincoln's eyes and ears at crime scenes on the Watchmaker case, but she's now running her own homicide investigation—her first case as lead detective. The policewoman's unwavering efforts in pursuing the killers of a businessman, who left behind a wife and son, sets into motion clockwork gears of its own, with consequences reaching to people and events that will endanger not only many lives but Lincoln's and Amelia's future together.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" reviewed the book saying "Deaver fans won't be surprised that the investigations overlap, or that the several apparent climaxes are building to something more, but even they will be hard-pressed to peel back all the layers of the cunning plot at work beneath the surface."
Joe Hartlaub of "BookReporter.com" reviewed the book saying "As always, Deaver educates as well as entertains, and within the novel's pages he drops small but fascinating nuggets regarding time and clocks. If you don't know why we say "speed up" or "slow down," you will after reading THE COLD MOON. You will also have the pleasure of reading what is not only Deaver's best work to date but also one of the best books of the year thus far"

Steamboats in Canada

Steamboats in Canada have a long history, both freshwater and ocean going.
The Canadian paddlewheeler PS Accommodation was the first successful steamboat built entirely in North America in 1808.
The PS Frontenac was the first on the Great Lakes. The Rideau Canal, St. Lawrence River, and large rivers of the west provided ample areas to work in.
Samuel Cunard of Nova Scotia developed the successful Atlantic Steam Liner service in the 1830s with the SS Royal William. While shipbuilding and huge fleets of lakers on the Great Lakes proliferated in the nineteenth century. Their success led to penetration deep into the central continent, with the Anson Northrup in 1859 which became first steamer to cross the U.S.-Canadian border on the Red River, via the US Mississippi River system. Steamboats would also be involved in major political events, as when Louis Riel seized the International at Fort Garry, or Gabriel Dumont was engaged by the vessel Northcote at Batoche.
On the Pacific Coast the SS Beaver was the first steamer in the Northwest waters; it worked for the Hudson's Bay Company from 1835. The Vancouver was a steamboat built and operated by the Hudson's Bay Company to serve on the route to and from London, England to Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island. It was built in 1845. Shipbuilding continued into the next century with the Imperial Munitions Board and the Victory Ship of later years.

He and his rowing partner, Hamza Hussein, qualified for the men's double sculls event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing through a Tripartite Commission invitation. They were last-minute qualifiers for the Beijing Games, obtaining a place when North Korea declined an invitation to send rowers, and the invitation was reallocated to Iraq. They are two of only four competitors on the 2008 Iraqi Olympic team. Nawzad and Hussein train on the Tigris river in central Baghdad. Nawzad was living in Sweden, but returned to Iraq to train for the Olympics.
Haider won Iraq's first medal of the 2010 Asian Games, finishing third in the men's single skulls. After this victory Adel Ali, Secretary General of Iraq's National Olympic Committee announced that his organisation was committed to providing better funding for sport in Iraq.
Before the Asian Games, Haider and other members of the Iraqi squad spent a month preparing in the United States training with members of the U.S rowing team and competing in the prestigious Head of the Charles regatta.

Harmonic scalpel

The Harmonic scalpel is a cutting instrument used during surgical procedures to simultaneously cut and coagulate tissue. 
The instrument is similar to a Bovie, but superior in that it can cut through thicker tissue, creates less toxic surgical smoke, and may offer greater precision. However, the harmonic scalpel is not as easily maneuverable as the Bovie, and takes longer to cut and coagulate tissue. Additionally, while a Bovie can be used to coagulate bleeding tissue at any time, the Harmonic scalpel only coagulates as it cuts. The 'Harmonic scalpel" causes less lateral thermal damage than the "Bovie". Whereas a Bovie performs its action via an electrical current (and production of heat), the Harmonic scalpel cuts via vibration. The scalpel surface itself cuts through tissue by vibrating in the range of 55,500 Hz. The high frequency vibration of tissue molecules generates stress and friction in tissue, which generates heat and causes protein denaturation. This technique causes minimal energy transfer to surrounding tissue, preventing collateral damage. 
The Harmonic brand is manufactured and distributed by Ethicon Endo-Surgery a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.

Tuhbenahneequay

Tuhbenahneequay (1780–1873) was a Mississauga Indian from the Burlington Heights area of Upper Canada. The daughter of chief Wahbanosay and Puhgashkish, she married Augustus Jones in a Mississauga ceremony sometime in the 1790s. Their first child, Thayendanegea was born in 1798. The same year, Jones married another woman, Sarah Tekarihogen, in a Christian ceremony. Polygamy was an acceptable practice among the Mississaugas, and Jones lived with Tekarihogen at his farm in Stoney Creek and with Tuhbenahneequay as his wife while surveying. Tuhbenahneequay was baptised "Sarah Henry" by an American Methodist circuit-rider in 1801. She was the first Mississauga woman baptised a Methodist. Despite her baptism, she refused to become a Christian. Her second child by Augustus Jones, Kahkewaquonaby, later known as the missionary Peter Jones, was born in 1802. The same year, Jones ended his relationship with Tuhbenahneequay as he wanted the respect of his white Christian neighbours and Tuhbenahneequay refused to convert. Both children were left with Tuhbenahneequay.
She later married Chief Mesquacosy, with whom she had 8 children, including Maungwudaus in 1811 and Wahbunoo in 1817. After the conversion of her son Kahkewaquonaby to Methodism in 1823, she was quickly converted, and moved to Davis' Hamlet where he was living in 1824. She followed him to the Credit Mission around 1826.
One hundred fifty trees at Toronto Carrying-Place Trail were named "Tuhbenahneequay Ancient Grove" in her honour.

Miller sold the house and of land in 1809 to Jeremiah Tarleton, a new settler from Maryland. William C. Graves bought the property from Tarleton's estate in 1833.
Architecture.
The John Andrew Miller House was constructed with strong materials to provide protection from attacks by Native Americans that occurred in the frontier areas of Virginia. The rugged doors were made of "6 panels on the outside and bias batten on the inside".

2008 Chick-fil-A College Kickoff

The 2008 Chick-fil-A College Kickoff took place on August 30, 2008, in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. This was the first game of the Chick-fil-A College Kickoff series. The game featured the No. 9 Clemson Tigers and the No. 24 Alabama Crimson Tide.
The Crimson Tide quickly took control of the game, scoring on their first three possessions en route to a 34–10 rout of the Tigers. Led by defensive MVP Terrence Cody, the Crimson Tide defense held Clemson's highly touted running game to zero total yards.
Background.
Alabama.
The Alabama Crimson Tide football team was led by second-year head coach Nick Saban. In his first season, the Crimson Tide went 7–6, losing their final four regular season games, as the team won the 2007 Independence Bowl over Colorado. During the offseason, rivals.com gave the Crimson Tide the #1 recruiting class, headlined by wide receiver Julio Jones.
Clemson.
The Clemson Tigers football team entered at 4.5 point favorites over the Crimson Tide. Clemson was led by head coach Tommy Bowden who was in tenth season as head coach of the team. In their 2007 season, the Tigers finished with a 9–4 record, which ended with a 23–20 overtime loss in the 2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl to, Alabama's rivals, Auburn. Clemson entered the game with running backs James Davis and C. J. Spiller, who were referred to as "Thunder" and "Lightning" respectively.
Game.
The Clemson Tigers, the preseason favorite to win the ACC, were favored going into the season opener at the Georgia Dome. Some believed that the Crimson Tide's youth and inexperience would prove a serious disadvantage against an experienced team like Clemson. However, Alabama quickly took control in what would eventually be a lopsided victory. By the end of the first quarter, Bama led 13–0, and they extended their lead to 23–3 by halftime. The only scare came when C.J. Spiller returned the second half kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. However, the Tigers failed to score again. James Davis and C.J. Spiller combined for only 20 yards on the ground, while the team's rushing total was 0. Clemson's redshirt senior quarterback, Cullen Harper, completed 20 of 34 passes but had no touchdowns and one interception. Alabama's John Parker Wilson completed 22 of 30 passes with no interceptions. He threw two touchdowns to Nick Walker and Julio Jones, and rushed for one himself. The Crimson Tide Tide went on to win by a score of 34–10.
Notes.
A. : Rankings reflect those of the AP Poll at the time of the game.

Ginga (middleware)

Ginga is the middleware specification for the Nipo-Brazilian Digital TV System (SBTVD, from the Portuguese "Sistema Brasileiro de TV Digital"). Ginga is also ITU-T Recommendation for IPTV Services. It is also considered in ITU-T recommendations for Cable Broadcast services (ITU-T J.200 Recommendation series: Rec. ITU-T J.200, Rec. ITU-T J.201 and Rec. ITU-T J.202) and for Terrestrial Broadcast services by ITU-R BT.1889, ITU-R BT.1699 and ITU-R BT.1722. Ginga was developed based on a set of standardized technologies but mainly on innovations developed by Brazilian researchers. Its current reference implementation was released under the GPL license.
Ginga is divided into two main integrated subsystems, which allow the development of applications following two different programming paradigms. Those subsystems are called Ginga-NCL (for declarative NCL applications) and Ginga-J (for imperative Java applications).
In the case of the Brazilian Terrestrial Digital TV System, and any other Digital TV Systems following the definitions in the ABNT standards for the Ginga Middleware ABNT 15606, Ginga-J is required to be supported in fixed receivers and it is optional in portable receivers. For IPTV services following the H.761 ITU-T Recommendation, only the Ginga-NCL subsystem is required, for any terminal type.
Development.
Ginga was developed by Telemídia Lab from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) and by LAViD from Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB).
Origin of the name.
Ginga is an almost indefinable, mystical quality of movement and attitude possessed by Brazilians and evident in everything they do. The way they walk, talk, dance and approach everything in their lives. The name Ginga was chosen for the middleware in recognition of the culture, art, and constant fight for freedom and equality of the Brazilian people. Ginga is the fundamental movement in capoeira, and pronounced jinga; literally: rocking back and forth; to swing.

Chase the Sun (Shannon Lawson album)

Chase the Sun is the debut album of American country music artist Shannon Lawson. It was released in 2002 (see 2002 in country music) on the MCA Nashville label, and it produced two singles: "Dream Your Way to Me" and "Goodbye on a Bad Day", which respectively reached #45 and #28 on the "Billboard" country charts, while the album peaked at #35 on the Top Country Albums charts.
History.
When Lason was signed to MCA Nashville in 2002, he caught the attention of record producer Mark Wright, who was impressed with the range of material that Lawson had shown on his demo tape. Wright, then, decided to give Lawson "the freedom to experiment" in the studio, and the resulting album featured experimental instrumentation, such as on "This Old Heart", where Chris Thile of Nickel Creek played mandolin. Thile's mandolin was recorded through an amplifier, giving what Wright described as a "real crunchy sound, very different". Other songs on the album were described as "instrumentally driven". Also included was a cover of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On", done here in a bluegrass style.
After the release of this album, Lawson was dropped from MCA Nashville. In 2004, he signed to Equity Music Group, a label owned by Clint Black. Although Lawson charted two singles on Equity, his second album was never released.
Personnel.
Strings performed by the Nashville String Machine, conducted and arranged by David Campbell.

EMG 89

The EMG-89 is an active humbucking pickup produced by EMG, Inc for use in electric guitars. It is customarily used in the neck position. It is essentially an 85 model humbucking pickup that can be electronically "split" to produce an output similar to that of the single-coil SA model.
Inside the EMG-89 pickup are both single and dual-coil pickups, each with its own output. The single-coil mode is an Alnico loaded stacked EMG-SA. The dual-coil mode consists of two Alnico loaded coils opposite one another creating a pickup similar to the EMG-85. A push/pull volume or tone enables you to switch from the clarity of a single-coil to the fatness of a humbucking. Virtually noiseless in both modes, it can also be used with several EMG accessories such as the SPC, EXG expander, or the PA2 preamp booster.
The EMG-89R is the same pickup except that the position of the single coil is on the side opposite that of the logo. This is so that when the pickup is placed in the neck position of an instrument the single coil has a warmer tone.

USS Buckthorn (AN-14)

USS "Buckthorn" (YN-9/AN-14) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. Originally ordered as USS "Dogwood" (YN-3), she was renamed and renumbered to "Buckthorn" (YN-9) before construction began in December 1940. She was launched in March 1941, and completed in September 1941. Placed in service at that time without being commissioned, she was commissioned in December 1942, and decommissioned in August 1947. She was placed in reserve in 1947 and scrapped in 1976.
Career.
The second ship to be so named by the Navy, "Buckthorn" (YN-9) was laid down on 5 December 1940 at Alameda, California, by the General Engineering & Drydock Co.; launched on 27 March 1941; sponsored by Mrs. Rosalie Benton Day; and placed in service at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 16 September 1941, Lt. Lewis Williams, USNR, in charge. That same day, the ship departed the Mare Island Navy Yard. She arrived at San Pedro, California, on the 20th and reported for duty as a unit of the net defenses and inshore patrol. She spent the next 21 months tending nets and conducting patrols at San Pedro. During that time, on 9 December 1942, "Buckthorn's" status was changed from in service to in commission. 
At the end of June 1943, the net tender received orders reassigning her to the 13th Naval District. She departed San Pedro on 14 July 1943 and arrived in Seattle, Washington, on the 21st. On the 22d, the ship entered the Winslow Ship Yards for an overhaul that lasted until 15 August. At that time, "Buckthorn" began tending nets at Manchester, Washington.
On 3 September 1943, she got underway from Manchester, bound for duty in Alaskan waters. The ship arrived at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on the 12th and began service with the net defenses there. At the end of the month, she moved to Adak and, by 5 October, had joined the net defenses at Attu. 
On 13 October, she participated in what appears to be the only combat action of her career when she fired one round of 3-inch and 120 rounds of 20-millimeter at attacking Japanese bombers. She continued her service at Attu until the spring of 1944. During that time, on 1 January 1944, she was reclassified an auxiliary net tender and redesignated "AN-14".
On 24 April 1944, she set sail to join the net defenses at Amchitka Island. Her tour of duty at Amchitka lasted from 25 April to 28 June. On 29 June, "Buckthorn" returned to Adak for almost three months of service. On 23 September, the net tender shaped a course back to Attu where she remained from 25 September to 24 January 1945. She next tended nets at Adak again between 29 January and 16 April. On the latter day, "Buckthorn" headed back to Amchitka where she served during the period 17 April to 5 June. On 5 and 6 June, she made the voyage between Amchitka and Adak, spending the following 10 weeks at the latter island.
On 18 August, "Buckthorn" departed Adak for Dutch Harbor. Between 20 August and 5 September, she underwent her first overhaul at Dutch Harbor. The ship returned to Adak on 7 September and resumed her duties with the net defenses there. "Buckthorn" continued to serve at various locations in the Aleutians until March 1946. 
On 14 March 1946, she arrived in Seattle, Washington, for her second overhaul. The ship entered the Todd Pacific Shipyard on 1 May and emerged again on 16 July. The net tender returned to Alaskan waters at Kodiak on 27 July. She resumed her former duties at the several familiar Aleutian locations until late April 1947. On 23 April, "Buckthorn" received orders heralding her inactivation.
After a leisurely voyage that included lengthy stops at Dutch Harbor, Kodiak, and Seattle, the net tender arrived in San Diego, California, at the end of the first week in August. 
On 20 August 1947, "Buckthorn" was decommissioned and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1963, and she was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration to be berthed with the Suisun Bay facility of its National Defense Reserve Fleet. She was scrapped in 1976.

Bob Geary (police officer)

Robert J. ("Bob") Geary is a former officer in the San Francisco Police Department who gained notoriety as the subject of a ballot initiative to allow him to take his ventriloquist's dummy, Brendan O'Smarty, on foot patrol.
Early life.
Geary holds an undergraduate degree in art, and a master's degree in education. He earned four Medals of Valor. He was a member of AFTRA and the Screen Actors' Guild, having worked as a hand model and starring opposite Don Johnson in a 1981 television movie, "The Two Lives of Carol Letner".
In the 1980s he became a favorite subject of columnist Herb Caen, after he wrote a letter to the editor of the "San Francisco Chronicle" defending the police department for issuing too many tickets to taxicabs. Officer Geary was found "not guilty" of writing too many tickets at a public event held in a North Beach theater that featured a stripper in the role of bailiff.
Ballot initiatives.
In 1988, San Francisco police attempted for budgetary reasons to end its historic horse patrol program for which his then-girlfriend served as a mounted police officer. Geary sponsored a ballot initiative to save the program, which passed with 86 percent of the local vote, the highest margin of any to date in the city.
In 1991 Geary was assigned to a community policing position in North Beach. The program encouraged officers to be "highly visible" and use "creative and ingenious methods" to earn the trust of local civilians. Geary decided to order an expensive wooden dummy out of a ventriloquist catalog. He bought an audiotape program to teach himself to use the dummy, practicing in front of a bathroom mirror. Geary chose the name "Smarty" as a pun on the word "Dummy," and the full name "Brendan O'Smarty" to add dignity to the doll. Geary took the dummy to entertain children while he was on patrol, dressing it in a police uniform with badge number 1/2 and a water pistol. Despite carrying the dummy, Geary was able to function as an officer, chasing and tackling at least one suspect with dummy in hand.
In 1992, San Francisco mayor Frank Jordan named a relatively unknown police officer, Anthony B. ("Tony") Ribera, to become chief of police. The previous chief, Richard Hongisto, was fired after only six weeks on the job for ordering his officers to destroy copies of the San Francisco Bay Times that had lampooned him over what the paper considered a heavy-handed police response to an outbreak of rioting following the Rodney King police brutality verdict. Whereas Hongisto had tolerated Brendan O'Smarty, Ribera ordered Geary to keep the dummy in his police car while he went out on patrol. Despite an internal appeal and some press coverage, the department refused to rescind the order. The board of supervisors passed resolution urging the mayor to override the police chief, but he refused.
In 1993 Geary formed the "Committee to Save Puppet Officer Brendan O'Smarty," which collected nearly 10,000 signatures in a self-financed campaign to bring the matter to a local referendum. The measure was designated and certified for the general election in November, 1993, the last of 28 ballot measures. The ballot's wording was:
Shall it be the policy of the people of San Francisco to allow Police Officer Bob Geary to decide when he may use his puppet Brendan O'Smarty while on duty?
Despite opposition from the police chief and others who considered the referendum an embarrassment, the measure passed by a narrow 51% to 49% margin. Geary continued to use the puppet throughout the 1990s and became, in addition to a local phenomenon, a celebrity at ventriloquist conventions nationwide, and appearing in the 2000 documentary, "Dummies!"
Tax lawsuit.
Soon after the election Geary attempted to take an $11,500 tax deduction over the funds he spent on the ballot measure, calling them an "advertising expense" to offset $10,000 paid him by Interscope Communications for work on developing a screenplay over the ballot affair. The Internal Revenue Service objected in 1995, and filed a notice of deficiency in 1997. The case drew nationwide attention, bringing appearances for Geary on "Prime Time Live" and Comedy Central. In its own public relations effort the IRS issued a number of humorous statements, saying among other things, "when it comes to taxes, Officer O'Smarty is a dummy."
In 2000 the United States Tax Court ruled against Geary, reversing the deduction and assessing back taxes and "accuracy" penalties, on the basis that expenditures spent on political causes such as ballot initiatives are disallowed under Internal Revenue Code section 162(e), even if they would otherwise be deductible under other sections of the code. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later upheld that decision but reversed the accuracy penalties because Geary had taken the deductions in good faith.
Retirement.
In 1998 the police department named a horse after Geary. In 2000 Geary sued an advertising agency for using his likeness to promote the Colorado Lottery.
Officer Geary and Brendan O'Smarty retired from the police force in 2000. Then-mayor Willie Brown declared the day "Officer Geary Day". For his last day Geary went on patrol in a Wells-Fargo stagecoach drawn by four horses.

Jack Little (American football)

Jack Harold Little (born December 31, 1931 in Corpus Christi, Texas) is a former American football player and assistant football coach. After playing college football for Texas A&M, he played two seasons for the Baltimore Colts from 1953–54. He later served as a college assistant coach before working in Texas' parole system and finally retiring.
Early years.
Little was born in Corpus Christi, Texas. At the age of 12, his father died. His mother remarried when Jack was a senior in high school and moved to Washington, D.C. Jack and his older brother, Gene, remained in Corpus Christi. His brother received a scholarship to play football at Rice University.
In high school, Little was a second-team All-District football player.
Playing career.
Although Little enrolled at the University of Houston as a freshman, he did not attend any classes or played football there. Intimidated by the three-a-day practices that Houston held, Little and a high school friend escaped to Texas A&M. Little tried out for the football team, only because head coach Harry Stiteler was impressed by his toughness, determination, and intelligence. 
Little lettered in football at Texas A&M from 1950–52. In 1950, he was part of an A&M squad that led the Southwest Conference (SWC) in total offense, and played in the Presidential Cup. Little made two All-America first teams during his college years, one as a junior in 1951 and another as a senior in 1952. He also named an All-SWC lineman the same years. He also made the distinguished students list during his senior year for his academic performance. He was ultimately inducted into the Texas A&M Athletic Hall of Fame in 1982. 
In the 1953 NFL Draft, Little was selected in the 5th round (50th overall) by the Baltimore Colts. He played two seasons for the Colts before a back injury ended his playing career.
Career after the NFL.
After his brief stint in the NFL, Little became an assistant football coach for Texas A&I (now Texas A&M–Kingsville). He was subsequently offered another assistant job by Baylor University head coach John Bridgers. Little accepted the position in 1963, and helped lead the Bears to an 8–3–0 record and a No. 20 finish in the national Coaches Poll. Little served as a coaching assistant at Baylor until 1968, when Bridgers was fired. Little remained for a brief period at Baylor, working in the school's outdoor education program.
Little later became an assistant for Sam Houston State University. He quit the coaching profession after another back injury. He then worked for Texas' parole system for 17 years before retiring in 1996.
Personal.
Little married his wife Nancy in 1950, which was at the end of his freshman year. They soon had the first of their two daughters by the time he left Texas A&M. His oldest daughter eventually received a doctorate degree from the school.

Kilnaleck or Kilnalec () is a small village in County Cavan, Ireland on the R154 regional road. Kilnaleck was once the centre of a mining boom when in 1879 some local businessmen and a school headmaster decided to develop the coal that existed nearby. However, the coal was very deep and hard to extract and the mine was forced to close.
Transport.
A number of Cavan Area Rural Transport (CART) routes serve Kilnaleck. Over the decades Kilnaleck was served by CIÉ and from 1987 by Bus Éireann. However in 2009 the remaining service, Bus Éireann route 179, was discontinued. Nowadays the nearest Bus Éireann routes may be accessed at Mountnugent (route 187) or Ballinagh (route 111), 7 km and 10 km distant respectively.

Elizabeth of Denmark, Electress of Brandenburg

Elizabeth of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (24 June 1485 – 10 June 1555) was a Scandinavian princess who became Electress of Brandenburg as the spouse of Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg. She was daughter of King Hans of Denmark, Norway and Sweden and his spouse, Christina of Saxony.
Biography.
As a child, Elizabeth had a close relation with her brother, the later King Christian II of Denmark. She was able to read and write in both Danish and German. On 10 April 1502 she married Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg, in a double wedding alongside her uncle, the future king Frederick I of Denmark, and her sister-in-law Anna of Brandenburg. Elizabeth and Joachim got along quite well during the first twenty years of their marriage and co-existed harmoniously. She received her mother in 1507, attended her brother Christian's wedding in 1515 and received Christian in 1523. 
Her spouse was a pugnacious adherent of Roman Catholic orthodoxy during the Reformation. In 1523, she visited a sermon of Martin Luther with her brother and her sister-in-law and became a convinced Protestant. In 1527, she received the Protestant communion in public: this meant a public break with the Catholic Church, and caused a conflict with her husband. In 1528, her husband asked a clerical council from the Catholic Church if he should divorce, execute or isolate her if she refused to renounce her new conviction. The church council replied that he should have her imprisoned. Elizabeth escaped to the court of her uncle, John, Elector of Saxony, and a public debate broke out: the Protestant monarchs and her brother supported her, Luther supported her freedom to leave her husband for her religion, and she declared that she would return only if she was allowed to keep her conviction and if her husband renounced his adultery and his interest in astrology. Otherwise, she suggested that they separate, referring to the separation of her own parents in 1504. She was given a residence near Wittenberg. Her husband refused to give her an allowance and forbade her sons to visit her. In 1532, her uncle died and her brother was imprisoned, and she thereby lost her supporters. In 1535, her husband died and her sons asked her to return to Brandenburg, but changed their minds when she made the demand that the parishes in her dowry lands be made Protestant. She finally returned in 1545 and stayed in Spandau. 
The marriage of her son Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg, to Hedwig Jagiellon did not satisfy Elizabeth. Catholic services were held for Hedwig in her private chapel, and the Dowager Electress was also unhappy because Hedwig could not speak German.
Issue.
Elizabeth's children were the following:

Corrosion engineering

Corrosion Engineering is the specialist discipline of applying scientific knowledge, natural laws and physical resources in order to design and implement materials, structures, devices, systems and procedures to manage the natural phenomenon known as corrosion. Generally related to Metallurgy, Corrosion Engineering also relates to non-metallics including ceramics. Corrosion Engineers often manage other not-strictly-corrosion processes including (but not restricted to) cracking, brittle fracture, crazing, fretting, erosion and more. 
Corrosion engineering groups have formed around the world in order to prevent, slow and manage the effects of corrosion. Examples of such groups are the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) and the European Federation of Corrosion (EFC), see Corrosion societies. The corrosion engineers main task is to economically and safely manage the effects of corrosion on materials. Corrosion Engineering Masters degree courses are available worldwide and are concerned with the control and understanding of corrosion.
Zaki Ahmad in his book "Principles of corrosion engineering and corrosion control"(10)states that "Corrosion engineering is the application of the principles evolved from corrosion science to minimize or prevent corrosion. Corrosion engineering involves designing of corrosion prevention schemes and implementation of speciﬁc codes and practices. Corrosion prevention measures, like cathodic protection, designing to prevent corrosion and coating of structures fall within the regime of corrosion engineering. However, corrosion science and engineering go hand-in-hand and they cannot be separated: it is a permanent marriage to produce new and better methods of protection from time to time". In the "Handbook of corrosion engineering" (4) the author Pierre R. Roberge states "Corrosion is the destructive attack of a material by reaction with its environment. The serious consequences of the corrosion process have become a problem of worldwide significance".
Curtin University offer a Postgraduate Certificate in Corrosion Engineering (9) in Corrosion Engineering and state; "Corrosion engineering offers exciting career opportunities for engineers, scientists and researchers. Corrosion to metals as an example of corrosion had cost the U.S. economy nearly $300 billion per year in 1995 . It is an issue particularly pertinent to the energy and resource industries where optimal corrosion management practices can have a positive impact on maximising efficient, safe production."

Psychopedagogy

Psychopedagogy is a combination of two main branches of study, Pedagogy and Psychology.
Some of the most influential authors in this field are Jean Piaget, Ausubel, Jerome Bruner and Lev Vygotsky. Important contributions have also been made by Mary Warnock in the field of special education and authors such as John D. Krumboltz (DECIDES program) in the academic and professional orientation. In Spain we can highlight the works of Rafael Bisquerra, Manuel Álvarez y Jesús Alonso Tapia amongst various others.
The Psychopedagogy Degree provides students with the tools needed to take part in the
different stages and all the areas of the teaching/learning process.
These professionals can act on the people who take part in this teaching/learning
process (children, teenagers, elderly people, families…) directly, or indirectly by
designing the support material needed to make this process easier.
This degree’s main objective is to enable students to elaborate and develop counselling
activities and programmes to help the education community to both improve and renew
educational processes and create the right conditions to carry them out.
To achieve this, the Psychopedagogy Degree aims at developing academic, personal and
labour skills to make educational psychologists’ tasks easier. These skills enable
professionals to know, inform and take part in the educational process and to solve
conflicts which may arise during its development.
The discourse of quality in education.
The reorientation of the official discourses about education has been prominent
recently. This reorientation practically affects all dimensions of the teaching system:
from the debate on State responsibility for educational provision to the definition of
teacher’s work. In addition, what is considered an adequate curriculum or the attention
to diversity in the classroom should also be taken into account (Bonal 1998: 188).
The greater emphasis on the quality of educational systems has entailed
a redefinition of the equality principle. Moreover, flexibility has also become an updated
topic.
The theory of human capital reflected the public (social) and private (individual)
confidence in the educational system in the Sixties as a factor of development and
progress. This theory insisted mainly on the “quantity” of education: the better
prepared the workers were, the higher work productivity and economic growth
would be. However, the over-education and the unemployment of graduates implied
the partial invalidation of the theory and a smaller increase of the public expenditure
on education (Bonal 1998: 172). Nevertheless, the recent resurgence of education
as a fundamental factor for economic growth and international competitiveness has
appeared. The recovery of the economic importance of education can be observed
in all educational reforms in all countries and in the reports of international agencies
(Bonal 1998: 172).
The main factor of change marked as responsible for this orientation is the
technological, economic, social and cultural change that is taking place and that
has originated the so-called “society of information”. The technological revolution
in information, due to its capacity for penetration into all fields of human activity, is
a starting point in the analysis of the complexity of the new training economy, society
and culture. However, this does not imply a new technological determinism (Castells
1999 vol. 1: 31). On the one hand, the technological revolution in information has
allowed a fundamental process in the reorganization of capitalism starting in the
Eighties. This has caused, among other things, new forms of work reorganization. On
the other hand, the transformations of the Information Society do not only affect the
economic and labour fields but also social and cultural relations and likewise power
relations among social groups. Probably one of the most debated phenomena of the
GRADUATES, LABOUR MARKET AND TEACHING QUALITY 17
new society is Globalization. Globalization affects all spheres and also all groups and
individuals, but not equally because it generates new forms of social exclusion. What
has really produced the new technological change is the rebirth of a political discourse
of human capital revalorisation, the debate over the impact of new technologies on
the quantity and quality of the employment generated or destroyed by them. What is
doubtless, though, is the impact that the new post-Ford regulatory forms have now and
will have in the future on educational systems. These are modifications that affect the
four message systems of educational knowledge: curriculum, pedagogy, evaluation,
and management and organization (Bonal 1998: 174–176).
Educational reforms in contemporary societies can be placed in this context and
likewise their discourse focused on quality and flexibility (Bonal 1998: 177).
Area of Work.
The areas in which a Psychopedagogy graduate can work are the following:
As regards labour insertion, there are three things to consider:
a) At present, the educational, psychopedagogical and professional guidance specialised
services (SEOEPP) IN THE Valencian Community are the secondary school guidance
departments, the school psychopedagogical services (SPE) and teams of experts.
b) They can also work in non-formal educational contexts.
c) Universities offer students and teachers assessment, counselling and continuous
education services.

Songs from the Southern Mountains

Songs from the Southern Mountains (subtitled The Doc Watson Family) is the title of a recording by American folk music artist Doc Watson and Family, released in 1994. The music is taken from recordings by Eugene Earle and D. K. Wilgus. It contains previously unreleased material from the early '60s as well as three tracks recorded in 1973. The liner notes are by Watson's daughter Nancy, recalling memories of grandpa Gaither Carlton, the first Watson Family recording session, and the April night that Merle Watson began playing guitar.
Reception.
Writing for Allmusic, music critic Jim Smith wrote the album "has a scattershot feeling about it that comes from the material being recorded at different times, but it digs up some good stuff along the way. Particularly nice are Watson's performances of Blind Boy Fuller's "My Little Woman, You're So Sweet" and "Just a Friend," in which he duets with mother Rosa Lee."

Radiator Springs

Radiator Springs is a cartoon village created as a composite of multiple real places on historic U.S. Route 66 from Kansas to Arizona. It appears in Pixar's 2006 "Cars (film)" and the associated franchise, as well as a section of the Disney California Adventure theme park.
Radiator Springs and vicinity.
The setting for the fictional town of Radiator Springs is situated between Gallup, New Mexico and the Sonoran Desert in California. However, the physical location of Radiator Springs in relation to I-40, as shown on a map during a flashback in the 2006 film, is similar to that of Peach Springs, Arizona.
Lasseter told film critic Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that much of the story is based on the recollections of barber Angel Delgadillo in the Route 66 town of Seligman, Arizona, where business withered soon after the opening of I-40.
Willy's Butte resembles the landmark of Mexican Hat, Utah, but also resembles a classic Pontiac hood ornament.
There is an "Ornament Valley" (a reference to Monument Valley).
The epilogue shows a map of the area of Arizona around Radiator Springs, including car-related place names such as "Carburetor County" and "Cadillac Range". The latter is a large north-to-south mountain range with many fin-backed jagged peaks, a reference to the famous Cadillac Ranch sculpture in Amarillo, Texas. Where the main road crosses the Cadillac Range is marked "Tailfin Pass 5942" (i.e. feet altitude, = 1.8111 kilometers).
Lizzie's Curio Shop in Radiator Springs resembles the Route 66 jumble of memorabilia and knick-knacks at Hackberry General Store in Hackberry, Arizona and the Sand Hills Curiosity Shop, aka the City Meat Market building in Erick, Oklahoma.
The bridge that McQueen sees Sally driving on resembles several bridges on Route 66, including the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge in Tulsa, the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena, California, and the now-closed bridge over Diablo Canyon at Two Guns, Arizona.
Flo's V8 café is designed to look like a V8 engine head on, with a circular air filter, tappet covers, spark plugs, pistons and connecting rods as the supports for the shelter. The blinking neon lights on the spark plugs blink in the firing order of a Ford flathead V8.
The rail grade crossing at which Lightning McQueen outruns a passenger train on his way to Radiator Springs is protected by a pair of antique "upper-quadrant" wigwag crossing signals which accurately depict those once made by the Magnetic Signal Company in both appearance and start-up. Few are left in actual operation in the United States, and many have been replaced with modern crossing gates, red lights and bells.
Continuity.
During the 2006 film's closing credits, the characters are at a drive-in watching clips of the Pixar films "Toy Car Story" ("Toy Story"), "Monster Trucks, Inc." ("Monsters, Inc.") and "A Bug's Life" ("Bug" as in Volkswagen Beetle), whose characters have been rendered as vehicles in the style of "Cars". Mack the red Mack Super-Liner comments that "they're just using the same actor over and over", an in-joke referring to John Ratzenberger, who voiced Mack and characters featured in the clips. The cinema itself is similar in design to an NRHP-listed 66 Drive-In in Carthage, Missouri, but without the later addition of widescreen and FM radio.
There are a few sights of the front page of a newspaper named "The Daily Exhaust", which serves primarily as a vehicle to explain the NASCAR history behind the Fabulous Hudson Hornet of the early 1950s.
Route 66.
Many characters and places in the film are directly inspired by real Route 66 places and people.
To quote the Pixar crew:
Among the many references to Route 66 landmarks and personalities:
Cameo.
The group of small birds from the 2000 Pixar short film "For the Birds" made a cameo appearance in Cars. As Mack is en route to California at 17:44 in the film, the group of small birds can briefly be seen (and heard) sitting on their familiar telephone wire. In addition, the Pizza Planet truck from "Toy Story" also makes a cameo outside of the race track, at the final race in the movie.
Other settings.
The track on which the opening race (Motor Speedway of the South) takes place is based on an enlarged version of Bristol Motor Speedway. The venue for the Piston Cup tiebreaker race (the Los Angeles International Speedway) is a conglomeration of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena where the Rose Bowl is located, as well as the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana. 
The sign "City of Emeryville – Closed for the race" is a nod to Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, California in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Kroa i bø

Kroa i Bø is a concert venue and a student house run mainly by volunteers made up of students of Telemark University College (TUC) (Norwegian: "Høgskolen i Telemark" - HiT) in Bø, Norway.
History.
Established in 1971 under the name Kro & Velferd as a student welfare association with the purpose to give the local students something fun to do in their spare time. The association changed name to Kro & Kultur and focused on parties and concerts with both Norwegian and international artists in different temporary locations around Bø. The name Kroa i Bø were loosely used about the association until 1985 when the students were given a former trailer garage and the house was named Kroa i Bø. The association who's running the house is still called "Kro & Kultur", but as a whole the name "Kroa i Bø" is almost always used.
Kroa i Bø is regarded as one of the best concert venues in Norway and are often named as one of the top 5. This was officially confirmed when the venue won the prize for ""Concert Promoter of the Year 2005"" (Norwegian: "Årets Konsertarrangør 2005"), a prize given by the organization for local promoters in Norway, Norsk Rockforbund. All the big artists in Norway has played at the venue and it is common knowledge that many artists prefer to start their tours at Kroa i Bø. Mainly because it's pretty close to Oslo, the promoters are professional and the audience is welcoming.
It is the official student house for the college students in Bø and has activities like a student paper, student radio, film club and many others.
It has only one steady employee, which is the daily administrator, but some 100-150 volunteers. Only open in the school semesters between August and December, and January through May.

Sir George Warrender, 7th Baronet

Vice-Admiral Sir George John Scott Warrender of Lochend, 7th Baronet, KCB, KCVO (31 July 1860 – 8 January 1917) was a senior officer in the Royal Navy during World War I.
Early career.
Warrender was the son of Sir George Warrender, 6th Baronet (1825–1901) and Helen Purves-Hume-Campbell, born at Bruntsfield House, Edinburgh. Warrender joined the navy as a cadet in 1873 at Dartmouth.

1914 Kiel Review.
In June 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War his squadron visited the German naval port of Kiel, during the annual regatta attended by Kaiser Wilhelm II and senior German admirals. The objective was to show off the modern British ships, and also inspect the German fleet. During the week long visit, news arrived of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Warrender's final message of farewell, in line with the spirit of the visit and the welcome which they had received, was "Friends in the past, friends forever".
During his tour, a German officer, Lieutenant George von Hase, was selected to accompany Warrender and act as his aid and translator. Hase was required to write a report about Warrender and other British officers he met, and later wrote a book describing the visit. He described Warrender as clean shaven and good looking, with an aristocratic face and fine blue eyes. He seemed around 50 with greying hair, but retained the vigour of a younger man. He appeared self-possessed and decided and was popular amongst his men because of his care for their concerns. Business was handled with short orders and short replies, so that despite an absence of military formalities everything was done professionally. Warrender was noticeably deaf: He could understand his staff without problem, but could sometimes have difficulty with other officers and strangers, particularly in a noisy environment such as a party. At dinner, seated with the Kaiser unfortunately on his deaf side, he had difficulty maintaining the conversation. He was reputed to be a good tennis player and splendid golfer.
The Admiral's wife accompanied him on the visit, staying on board the Hamburg-Amerika liner Viktoria Luise, which was customarily berthed in Kiel every year for Kiel week. This ship became the centre of high society for the occasion. There was a hectic round of social engagements, where the admiral had to be whisked between simultaneous events so as to be seen attending. Sporting competitions were arranged between English and German teams. Hase noted that the Germans won most of the events, except for football. He described the English sailors as noticeably small, while 70 men from "George V" were under 17 and he considered that there was a disproportionate number of older men.
Hase was instructed by Warrender to convey an invitation to Admiral von Ingenohl for any German officers who wished to visit and inspect the British ships. Ingenohl declined, on the grounds that he was forbidden to show visitors many parts of his ships. Warrender responded that, of course, some parts of British ships would also be off-limits and that he understood such restrictions, so visits were eventually arranged. British officers were only allowed to visit the older "Deutschland" class battleships, while important installations on British ships were covered. However, Hase reported that he was friendly with Commander Brownrigg, the gunnery officer, was happy to show him around almost all the ship, except for the 'firing director' which was regarded as strictly secret. Lord Brassey, who had arrived at Kiel on his own yacht, managed to become lost, and was found wandering in the secret submarine yard.
On the afternoon of 28 June news arrived of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, who had been a friend of the British ambassador to Germany, Edward Goschen, who was also staying on "George V". A discussion ensued at which Hase was present, where Warrender warned of the likelihood that many European countries would now be drawn into a war. Social engagements were cancelled, although the regatta events were completed.
Early the following morning the Kaiser departed for Vienna. The day continued on a somber note, with lunch on board "George V" for German admirals. Afterwards these were invited to tour the ship, but only Admiral Ingenohl and his officers accepted, and were given a demonstration of the main guns operating. Later Warrender attended a party given by British sailors for their German counterparts in return for the welcome they had received. Warrender was welcomed by a wave of thunderous stamping, and jumped onto a table to give a speech about friendship between the two nations. Three cheers were given for the German navy, before Rear Admiral Mauwe climbed on the table to respond and call three cheers for the English. The room once again resounded to stamping approval. In the evening Warrender attended the official Imperial Yacht club dinner, now presided over by Prince Henry, in the Kaiser's absence.
Hase commented on conversations with Warrender about the consequences of submarines on warfare. Although Warrender did not agree with views expressed by Admiral Percy Scott that submarines would bring an end to Britain's control of the seas, he did agree that in future close blockade would be impossible. He observed that the preparation of Scapa Flow as a long range naval base for the blockade of Germany, had been suggested by German officers.
World War I.
Shortly after the Kiel visit Warrender temporarily commanded the Grand Fleet ordered to move to Scapa Flow after annual exercises, when a declaration of war was considered imminent.
Warrender was considered a good admiral during peacetime, but his reputation suffered as the war proceeded. His squadron was regarded as one of the best trained in gunnery in the fleet. He was described by Commodore William Goodenough as having "an imperturbability that no circumstances could ruffle", although others ascribed this stolidity to simply a lack of initiative.
One of the battleships in his command, HMS "Audacious", sank after striking a mine when at sea for gunnery practice in October 1914. He commanded a British squadron of six battleships, four battlecruisers, cruisers and destroyers which attempted to intercept Admiral Hipper following Hipper's raid on Scarborough. Hipper escaped, some of his ships slipping past Warrender despite being spotted and coming within range of his superior force. First Sea Lord Fisher wanted Warrender replaced for his poor performance, but Warrender was a friend of Admiral John Jellicoe commanding the Grand Fleet, who kept him in his post because of his past experience handling large fleets. Warrender was also suffering from increasing deafness and was replaced in December 1915. He became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth in March 1916, but asked for retirement in December 1916 because of increasingly poor health. He died in January 1917, was cremated at Golders Green on 12 January and his ashes placed at the church of the Annunciation, Bryanston Street, London.
Family.
He married Lady Ethel Maud Ashley Cooper, daughter of the 8th earl of Shaftesbury, on 6 February 1894 at St. Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, London. He had three children, Sir Victor Alexander George Anthony Warrender 8th Bt., 1st Baron Bruntisfield (1942), Harold John Warrender and Violet Helen Marie Warrender.

Majdi Halabi

Majdi Halabi (, ; born 1985, died May 24, 2005), alternatively Majdy Halabi or Majdi Halaby, was an Israeli Druze soldier from the village of Daliyat al-Karmel, located on the slopes of Mount Carmel, who disappeared on duty near Haifa in May 2005.
Halabi's body was found in 2012 on Mount Carmel and he was buried in Isfiya with full military honors.
Background.
Halabi was born in 1985 to Nazmi Halabi, an employee at the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, and Fahmiya Halabi, in the Druze village of Daliyat al-Karmel, located on Mount Carmel. Halabi began his mandatory military service in the IDF in the Israeli Air Force at a Be'er sheva campus of the Israeli Air And Space technical college but had difficulties serving at the place and as a result he lowered his Medical Profile and was transferred to serve in a vehicle workshop of the Ordnance Corps, at a maintenance and rehabilitation (מרכז שיקום ואחזקה) base located near Haifa. When Halabi asked to raise his Medical Profile back in order to be transferred back to his old unit he was refused. During his military service Halabi became an absentee several times from the military bases in which he served.
The disappearance and search efforts.
Halabi disappeared on Tuesday, May 24, 2005, while he attempted to hitchhike from his village to his Ordnance Corps camp near Tirat Carmel, without carrying any weapons. At the time of his disappearance, he had served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for five months.
In his parents testimony given afterwards they claimed that he was last seen in civilian clothes and that he took with him a small bag, in which he presumably carried his IDF uniform. Nevertheless, additional witnesses claimed to have seen him in uniform. A witness from Halabi's village stated that he saw Halabi around 15:30 at the grocery store of the village, buying a beverage can, and further investigation revealed that he had pulled out 50 NIS from an ATM in his village before his disappearance. Various officers involved in the case claimed after the fact that there were a number of contradictions in the testimonies of his family members regarding his apparel, and the day and time he was last seen.
Two days after his disappearance, Halabi's commanding officers visited his home in order to inquire about his whereabouts. As a result, and a search was launched by Halabi's family, aided by Halabi's friends and the various residents of Daliyat al-Karmel. Searches were conducted in the village, on nearby beaches, in Haifa and in the Krayot and in the forests of Mount Carmel. The searches were even expanded later on to Tiberias and Eilat, after the family received information that someone similar to Halabi was seen in those cities. Throughout his first week of disappearance the IDF did not assist the family in their searches for Halabi. The local media reported in many occasions about the disappearance and the search efforts, but the matter got almost no exposure in the national media outlets. This fact was later on severely criticized by many officials, among them the head of the Druze community in Israel, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif.
On 30 May 2005, a week after his disappearance, the IDF officially declared Halabi as absent and as a result it initiated a full-scale search for him. Halabi's family was furious over the military's delay in announcing that he was his missing, as they requested that he would be declared as such already in the evening in which it was first discovered that had disappeared. As a result a massive search effort was initiated which involved the use of regular and reserve IDF troops, sniffer dogs from the Oketz Unit, and drones equipped with thermal imaging systems. The area where his body was eventually found was combed repeatedly, but was not found due to the thickness of the forest and mountainous terrain. More than one hundred volunteers participated in search efforts in the Mount Carmel area. Halabi was formally declared to be missing in action (MIA) on June 6. Throughout the following years, police established several teams to investigate his disappearance. Compared to Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Halabi's disappearance received relatively little coverage in the Israeli media.
According to a 2007 article in "Israel Today", his case was "all but forgotten" nationally and internationally.
As part of the effort to find any information that would eventually lead to solving the mystery of his absence, his family offered a reward for any information that would be given of his whereabouts, and the organization Born to Freedom Foundation, that aims to accelerate the release of IDF POWs and missing soldiers, began publishing the case widely in order to bring public awareness to Halabi's disappearance. Subsequently, the Born to Freedom Foundation offered a reward of USD10,000,000 for information leading to Halabi's location.
Later developments.
On May 24, 2007, the two-year anniversary of Halabi's disappearance, Halabi's family and residents of Carmel City held a gathering to raise awareness of Halabi's case and call for increased efforts to locate him. The event was attended by a large crowd, including many Druze military officers, the Defense Minister Amir Peretz, and Karnit Goldwasser (the wife of the kidnapped IDF soldier Ehud Goldwasser) whom spoke in the event, and Zvi Regev who is the father of the kidnapped soldier Eldad Regev. Defense Minister Amir Peretz stated in the event that he had been in contact with the family on a weekly basis in order to encourage the family. The families of the three IDF soldiers kidnapped in the 2000 Hezbollah cross-border raid, whom also attended the event, also expressed their support of Halabi's family.
In a 2007 interview with "The Jerusalem Post", Halabi's uncle, Samih Halabi, a retired IDF colonel and chairman of the Campaign to Find Missing Soldier Majdi Halabi, expressed the belief that Halabi had been abducted by an Islamic "terrorist organization" and was "being held in Syria, Lebanon or possibly even in Nablus or Jenin in the West Bank".
On July 2, 2008, Halabi's family received a telephone call from an inmate in Damon Prison who claimed that Halabi had been abducted and was being held in the vicinity of Nablus in the West Bank. Police officials maintained that the inmate had "no substantial information" regarding Halabi's disappearance, but the Halabi family disputed this claim.
In 2010, the killer of 18-year-old Danna Bennett, Yahya Adwan Farhan (יחיא עדואן פרחאן), stated in an interview with Ma'ariv that he knows what caused the disappearance of Majdi Halabi, but declined to provide further information.
In 2011, Halabi's brother, Adham Nazmi Halabi, 21, was killed in a traffic accident in Daliyat al-Karmel. He had been serving in the Israel Border Police at the time of his death.
In April 2012, it was reported that two prisoners serving sentences for murder and drug-related offenses were negotiating a plea bargain to supply the burial location of Halabi in return for being freed as well as a few hundred thousand shekels.
Discovery of body.
In the aftermath of the 2010 Carmel Fire, Halabi's family asked that the search be resumed, as the forest floor was more exposed. On 10 October 2012, his body was found in a forest near Isfiya. Halabi's childhood friend, Ibrahim Kozly of Daliyat al-Karmel, discovered his body while performing clearing work for the Jewish National Fund as part of the Carmel Forest's rehabilitation project. Halabi's body became visible after he removed tree debris from the area. A knife was discovered near the body. The body was transferred to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv, where DNA testing confirmed that it was Halabi's.
Halabi was buried in Isfiya's military cemetery with full military honors on October 12, 2012, in a funeral that saw over 2,000 people in attendance.

RAF Brenzett

RAF Brenzett was a Royal Air Force station close to the village of Brenzett near Romney Marsh in Kent during the Second World War. It was used as an airfield in 1944 for the Mustang Wing which comprised three squadrons including two Polish squadrons in exile and operated patrols against V-1 flying bombs.
History.
The site was chosen for an advanced landing ground in July 1942 and construction work on the site of flat marshland commenced in 1943, it was due to open on 1 March 1943 but was not ready for occupation until September and the airfield opened as RAF Brenzett as part of RAF Fighter Command on 14 September 1943 with two Sommerfeld Tracking runways. The locals referred to the airfield as Ivychurch after the nearest village. The airfield eventually had five blister hangars for the aircraft but most of the personnel were housed in a tented camp.
The first unit to use the airfield was 122 Sqn with Supermarine Spitfires in August 1943 who used it relieve pressure on their home airfield of RAF Kingsnorth five miles (8 km) to the north. The airfield was not used to support the D-Day landings but in July 1944 a Mustang Wing (No 133 Polish Fighter Wing) with three squadrons was based there, mainly on anti-flying bomb patrols.
The United States Army Air Corps designated the airfield Station Number 438. The main American unit was Battery C, 635 AAA (Anti-aircraft Artillery), Automatic Weapons Bn, IX Air Defence Command.
The Mustang wing left in October 1944 and the airfield was no longer needed, and closed on 13 December 1944, returning to agricultural use. In 1972 the Brenzett Aeronautical Museum, a military and aviation museum, was opened near the site in buildings formerly occupied by the Women's Land Army.

Serey Die

Sereso Geoffroy Gonzaroua Die (born 7 November 1984 in Abidjan), known as Serey Die, is an Ivorian football midfielder currently playing for FC Basel in the Swiss Super League.
Club career.
Early career.
Serey Die started his football for Centre Nationale des Sports de Haut Niveau in Abidjan. He played one year for Volcan Junior and one year for CO Korhogo before moving to top team Stade d'Abidjan in 2003. Three years later he moved to EO Goulette et Kram in Tunisia. But this was also to remain a short stay, he cancelled his contract himself after just half a year.
ES Sétif.
Then Serey Die was invited for a trial with ES Sétif and therefore moved to Algeria. This adventure nearly started and ended as a farce on the same day. As the club's president saw Serey Die he thought that the wrong player had been hired and sent him home. The coach asked Serey Die to stay for the training, which he did and in a test match he was able to convince the club's management to let him stay for a six month trial. During this trial period Serey Die played well and ES Sétif won the 2007–08 Arab Champions League. But Serey Die refused to sign the contact that he was subsequently offered.
Sion.
Between 2008 and 2012 Serey Die played for FC Sion, with whom he won the Swiss Cup twice. During March 2010, Serey Die came under suspicion of corruption in connection with betting manipulation. In May 2012, he was the subject of controversy after cameras filmed him slapping a thirteen year old ball-boy in the face. This was during the away game against FC Lausanne-Sport on 2 May. This assault resulted in an eight match suspension.
Basel.
On 13 December 2012, FC Basel announced that they had signed Serey Die on a three and a half year contract. Serey Die played his debut for Basel on 10 February 2013 in the 3–0 home win in St. Jakob-Park against his former club Sion. He scored his first goal for Basel, the first goal of the match, in the 4–0 away win against Luzern in the Swissporarena on 1 April 2013. At the end of the Swiss Super League seaon 2012–13, he won the Championship title and was Swiss Cup runner up with Basel.

Nathan Penlington

Nathan Penlington (born in Rhyl, North Wales), is a writer, poet, live literature producer and magician. His work has appeared on stage, in print and on the radio.
Career.
Nathan Penlington currently performs at venues and festivals across the UK, Europe and the US, and has shared stages with performers such as John Cooper Clarke, Ricky Gervais and Phill Jupitus. His performances fuse comedy, storytelling and magic with writing that led Robert Newman to describe him as "a natural performer, witty, inventive, stylish and original", and "Time Out" to comment that "Nathan Penlington's fusion of wit, storytelling and visuals are garnering critics’ plaudits and attention".
Penlington was co-organiser and resident host of London's weekly spoken word venue "Shortfuse", from April 2000 to September 2007. "Shortfuse" attained a reputation for presenting an eclectic fusion of stand-up poetry, performance comedy and music, and regularly presenting up-and-coming performers alongside established names such as John Hegley, Stewart Lee, Kevin Eldon and Simon Munnery, as well as forging working links with performers across the US, Canada and Europe. Shortfuse became renowned for creating new formats including "Bards in their Eyes", "Speed Cabaret", and "Poetry Idol". Poetry Idol's tongue in cheek competition format helped to bring wider attention to many up and coming poets and performers including Scroobius Pip, Stephen Howarth, Suzanne Andrade, Joshua Idehen and Musa Okwanga.
He has been employed to produce and host events for a wide variety of festivals including the Edinburgh International Film Festival, Brick Lane Festival, Stoke Newington Festival and Whitstable Arts Biennale. He was Festival Director for "Write to Ignite – Hackney Word Festival", which took place throughout September 2007.
In 2005, Penlington performed his début full length solo spoken word show "If My Life Hadn't Turned Out Differently" at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe at the Pleasance, after previewing the show at Chicago’s Drinking & Writing Festival, and in a variety of venues in New York including the renowned Bowery Poetry Club. In the following year, he made his 5th consecutive appearance at the festival, teaming up with two other spoken word artists, Rhian Edwards and Suzanne Andrade, to produce a show called "Invisible Ink" which fused magic, music, poetry and animation to critical acclaim.
Penlington’s next show – Uri & Me – an obsessive deconstruction of the spoon bending cultural icon Uri Geller was described as “a thoughtfully constructed, funny, yet litigation avoiding look at the life and work of a global celebrity phenomenon” by the Londonist. A combination of stand-up, magic and spoken word – the show premièred as a commission piece at the award-winning London Word Festival in March 2010. The show was also performed at the Camden Fringe, The Roundhouse, the Brighton Comedy Festival, the Oxford Literary Festival, Bristol Old Vic and Edinburgh Fringe 2011 at The Underbelly. The show gained good reviews along the way including a four star review in The Scotsman by Kate Copstick who said “The best shows are driven by a personal passion”. The show was even attended by Uri Geller, twice. 
In 2013 Penlington started work on "Choose Your Own Documentary" which is inspired by the Choose Your Own Adventure phenomenon of the 1980s combining film, stand-up, and storytelling the show allows the audience to interact with the performance by using wireless remote controls to decide what happens next. With over 1500 permutations each performance is unique. The show was co-commissioned by the Southbank Centre, and supported by Arts Council England. 
His work has been broadcast on BBC Radio 3's "The Verb", performing a work of 'predictive text poetry – a new creative form using the mobile phone'. He has also appeared on BBC Radio 4's 28 Acts in 28 Minutes, and he has hosted three series of the surreal spoken word show "Parlour Games" on Resonance FM.
Published works.
April 2008 saw the publication of "Almost Nearly", a full-length collection of graphic poems in a limited signed and numbered edition. It features some of the poems included in "Roadkill on the Digital Highway", which was short-listed for the Eric Gregory Award 2005, of which previous winners include Seamus Heaney and Andrew Motion.
Penlington’s written work has been featured in publications as diverse as Peaches Geldof’s magazine 'Disappear Here’, 'The Journal of Experimental Fiction', and it has also been translated into Serbian for 'Treci Trg'. He has recently been published in the Penned in the Margins anthology of experimental poetry ‘Adventures in Form’, as well as appearing in publications such as Rising, The Fix, Quiet Feather, Litmus, The Delinquent, Aesthetica magazine, The Rebel magazine, and X-Magazine. Penlington was Poetry Editor for The Fix Magazine – the UK's only monthly comedy magazine, which was distributed free at comedy venues across the country.

Vangueria infausta

Vangueria infausta, the medlar or African medlar, is a species of plant in the family Rubiaceae, which is native to the southern and eastern Afrotropics. The fruits are consumed by humans and have a pleasant apple like flavor. The specific name "infausta" alludes to the misfortune believed to result from its use as firewood. 
Description.
The trees are low-branching and mostly smallish but may reach 8 m in height. They have drooping branchlets and have pale greyish brown, flaky bark. The fairly large, dull leaves have entire margins and are somewhat variable in shape. They have an opposite arrangement and conspicuous net-veining below. Young leaves are boat-shaped and recurved along the central vein.
Dense clusters of robust green flowers develop from pointed buds in spring. Each velvety flower is about 4 mm long and 6 mm wide, and are carried on opposite and axillary cymes. The corolla is dropped early.
The initially green and glossy fruit appear in summer, and bear the remains of the calyx around their tips. They develop into unevenly-shaped, glossy, tan-coloured plums, that contain soft fleshy pulp and fairly large seeds.
Range.
This shrub or small tree occurs in abundance in woodlands, scrub, valleys, stony kopjies, or sandy dunes throughout much of Southern and East Africa, including Madagascar. In Africa it is native to Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. It may be found from 350 to 1,330 m above sea level.
Uses.
The African medlar is a traditional food plant in Africa. This little-known fruit has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable land care. The fruit are consumed raw or the pulp may be dried and stored for later use, while the seeds may be roasted. Goats and game browse on the leaves, while other animals may consume the fruit in the tree, or after they are shed on the ground. The roots and leaves are used by traditional healers. 
Thin twigs are prone to being populated by spittlebugs.

Dragon beard hook

The Chinese dragon beard hook (also known as the Longxu hook) is a thrown entangling/trapping concealable weapon. It features a two pronged steel hook about 33 cm long. An iron ring on a crescent-shaped body allows a rope to be attached. The hooks consist of two spearheads, 20 cm apart. The ends of the hooks are serrated. The rope is typically 10 metres long, and can be tied to the wrist of the user. This allowed the user to snag and reel in an adversary, which made the weapon very popular amongst constables in bygone days. 
Training to use the weapon is much like learning to use a rope dart. The weapon hails from Song Dynasty.

Hugh Quentin Alleyne Reeves (1909-25 October 1955) was a British inventor and engineer. He was one of the most productive and creative engineers attached to Station IX the SOE research station during World War II.
Reeves was born at Seaford Sussex. His first Prep School was West Downs School at Winchester but he transferred to St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne. He then went to Harrow and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.
During World War II Major Reeves was attached to Station IX, where he invented both the Welrod and the Sleevegun (similar to the Welrod, though single shot and intended to be concealed up a sleeve), as well as designing the Motorised Submersible Canoe. He was also, among others, behind the silencer for the Sten gun, fluorescent night sights, the Welbum gun and the Welbum. This was made clear in a document that was produced at the end of the war to ensure that the correct people were credited for their inventions. 
Reeves continued inventing after the war with patents for "Improvements in Diving Equipment" in 1950 and "Wheel holding chocks for Aircraft" in 1955.

Halifax Apartments, originally known as the Cross Arms Apartments, is a historic apartment building on Yucca Street in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Designed by Walker and Eisen, the building was completed in 1923. The building was originally owned by Leach Cross, who named it the "Cross Arms Apartments." At the time of its opening, it was considered "one of the largest and most beautiful apartment houses in Hollywood." In October 1924, the building sold for $750,000, and the new owner renamed the building the "Halifax Apartments." In its early years, the Halifax was a popular residence for entertainers, including silent film star Ned Sparks, and opera star Ernestine Schumann-Heink. It was also the site of important gatherings, including a 1937 reception hosted by Joseph Laemmle for Mayor Shaw which was also attended by the chief of police and district attorney. In 1981, the Halifax was converted to Section 8 housing for senior citizens. As of 2008, it was being operated as low income housing. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

Free Gaza Movement

The Free Gaza Movement is a coalition of human rights activists and pro-Palestinian groups formed to challenge the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip by sailing humanitarian aid ships to Gaza. The group has more than 70 endorsers, including Desmond Tutu and Noam Chomsky.
The organizations participating in the Free Gaza Movement include the International Solidarity Movement. The activists participating in the effort include Jeff Halper, Hedy Epstein, Lauren Booth, and members of various Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religious organizations. Israeli intelligence agencies say that it also includes Islamist organizations that pose a security threat to the Jewish state.
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Canada have all publicly opposed the 2011 flotilla.
August 2008 sailing.
The first sailing took place in early August 2008. It was organized by the Free Gaza Movement and the International Solidarity Movement. Many of the latter's members had been barred from entering Israel on security grounds. According to the Free Gaza Movement's Web site, the group intended for the boat to cross the Israeli-declared "special security zone" to deliver 100 hearing aids to a Palestinian charity as a form of humanitarian aid. A story in Israel-based "Haaretz" said the organizers were attempting to provoke a clash with the navy that would end with arrests. A spokesman for the group said, "We hope that the Israeli government will have some wisdom. To drag us in and arrest us and say somehow we are a danger is absurd."
They raised $300,000 from private donations and purchased two vessels. The group originally planned to depart from Piraeus on August 1, 2008, stopping at several Greek islands, and to then sail from Cyprus to Gaza on August 5. Organizers of Free Gaza told interviewers that they were not attempting to sail from Egypt or via Egyptian waters because they "did not want to make a political statement" hinting that Egypt disagreed with the plan. Cypriot officials expressed concern about the boat departing from their shores but said they could not prevent it.
On August 23 the ships arrived in Gaza. The Israeli Navy did not stop them but both boats had great difficulty with their communications, a problem they blamed on jamming by Israel in an attempt to prevent them from getting to Gaza.
Consequences.
Israeli citizen Jeff Halper did not return to Cyprus on the boats, but traveled into Israel via the Erez crossing. He was arrested and has been told he will be prosecuted for breaking the Israeli law forbidding its citizens from entering the Gaza Strip. A spokeswoman for the Free Gaza Movement believes that Israel’s foreign and interior ministries had given the boats permission to land in Gaza, and she believed that meant they were all in Gaza legally.
Lauren Booth, sister-in-law of Tony Blair, was refused permission to cross from Gaza into both Egypt and Israel after her arrival. Four weeks later, she was given permission to cross at the Rafah border terminal into Egypt.
October 2008 sailing.
The second sailing occurred in late October. The movement's 66-foot yacht, named "Dignity", arrived at a Gaza port on October 29. The ship carried 26 activists and medical supplies. Although Israeli officials initially announced that they would stop the ship, a last minute decision was reportedly made to allow the ship to enter Gaza. Among the passengers were 1976 Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Corrigan and Palestinian Legislative Council member Mustafa Barghouti. In July 2009, four citizens of the United Kingdom who had decided to stay in Gaza were turned away at both the Israeli and Egyptian border crossings over a period of several weeks when they attempted to leave.
December 2008 - February 2009 sailings.
The Free Gaza Movement attempted to reach Gaza twice during the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict.
On December 29, 2008, "Dignity" set sail from Cyprus, headed for Gaza, attempting to deliver of medical supplies to its residents. The boat, which was boarded by Caoimhe Butterly, Cynthia McKinney, journalists from Al Jazeera and CNN, three surgeons including Dr. Elena Theoharous, was forced to turn back after being intercepted by Israeli naval vessels off Gaza. According to The Free Gaza Movement, Israeli warships rammed their vessel then fired machine guns in the water. Israel states that the boat had failed to respond to Israeli naval radio contact and was attempting to outmaneuver the warships when the vessels collided. Not having enough fuel to return to Cyprus, the boat docked in Lebanon severely damaged.
The Cypriot foreign minister told public radio his country would lodge a formal protest over the incident. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman called the allegation of ramming the "Dignity" "absurd" while denying any intent. The Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast USA called McKinney "irresponsible", accusing her of a "provocation" that endangered many.
In January, the Free Gaza Movement again attempted to bring activists and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza under the Greek flagged decommissioned ferry called the "Arion". The 21 Free Gaza activists, among them several doctors, abandoned their journey after the ship encountered Israeli warships who warned them to leave the area. Greece had informed the Israeli government on its transfer of humanitarian aid days earlier, but also warned the leaders of the expedition about its dangers.
The "Dignity"'s final resting spot is in a Cyprian port after sinking during a storm.
On February 3, 2009 a ship was sent by the Free Gaza Movement and a Lebanese group, the Palestinian National Committee Against the Siege. The organizers said the Tali, a Togo-registered cargo vessel, was "carrying more than 60 tonnes of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip." On February 5, shots were fired and Israeli forces boarded the ship. "They are pointing guns against us; they are kicking us and beating us. They are threatening our lives," Al-Jazeera's Salam Khoder reported from aboard Tali. The ship was then taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod. According to Haaretz, "The IDF said that troops found about 150 bottles of mineral water and a few dozen kilograms of food and medicine on board... plus 10,000 units of human blood plasma which requires constant refrigeration. The IDF found no weapons aboard the ship.
June 2009 sailing.
The Free Gaza Movement returned to Cyprus in March 2009, to begin organizing for the summer sailings. The "Arion" was renamed "Spirit of Humanity" and sailed from the port of Larnaca on June 29. The 21 activists on board included former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney and the Nobel Laureate Mairead Maguire. Among the six journalists were two from Al Jazeera and documentary maker Adam Shapiro. They were heading toward Gaza with three tons of medical supplies and a symbolic load of construction materials.
On June 30, the Israeli Navy commandeered the vessel off the coast of Gaza. The Israeli military later issued a statement saying the boat had attempted to break a blockade of Gaza and was forced to sail to an Israeli port after ignoring a radio message to stay out of Gaza waters. The "Spirit of Humanity" was towed to Ashdod and the crew was detained pending deportation proceedings. After a security check of the humanitarian supplies, Israel officials promised to deliver them to Gaza by ground. Greta Berlin, a representative of the Free Gaza Movement in Cyprus, said: "We are outraged, they just stole our boat and kidnapped our people." Israeli officials blame the group for the controversy, saying they were looking for confrontation to attract publicity.
Two additional Israeli activists were released the next day. On July 3, five Bahraini activists were deported. A delegation from Bahrain visited Israel in an official capacity for the first time to accompany the deportees although officials said there was no other significance to the visit. McKinney and the others release was delayed after they refused to sign a document admitting they violated Israel’s blockade. From the Givon immigration detention center in Ramla, Maguire said that "deportation orders aren't appropriate for us, as we were taken to Israel against our will." The remaining activists were processed and released between July 5 and July 8.
May 2010 sailing.
The Free Gaza Movement and the Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) partnered to send multiple ships to the Gaza Strip in May 2010. Under the coordination of the Free Gaza Movement, numerous human rights organizations, including the Turkish Relief Foundation (IHH), the Perdana Global Peace Organization from Malaysia, the European Campaign to End the Siege of Gaza, and the Swedish and Greek Boat to Gaza initiatives sent three cargo ships loaded with reconstruction, medical and educational supplies. Multiple passenger boats with over 600 people on board accompanied the cargo ships. Passengers included members of Parliament from around the world, U.N., human rights and trade union activists, as well as journalists to document the largest coordinated effort to directly confront Israel’s blockade of Gaza and take in basic supplies. These include the MV "Rachel Corrie". In response to the plans, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said: "These people are not supporting the Palestinians and they are not even supporting humanitarian causes. They are engaged in only one thing, and that is to create provocations and to collaborate with Hamas propaganda."
The family of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit offered the organizers of the flotilla full support provided that "in addition to their demand that Israel lift its blockade they will urge Hamas to allow the soldier to receive letters and food packages from his family and allow international organizations to visit him". According to Attorney Nick Kaufman, who approached the Free Gaza Movement on behalf of the kidnapped soldier's family the offer was refused. The group strongly denied this, saying they had always called for the release of all prisoners, including Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and that they had accepted Mr. Kaufman's request but had not heard back from him since.
On May 27, 2010, "The Jerusalem Post" reported that participants included Mahmad Tzoalha and Sahar Albirawi, whom it called Hamas activists, although neither man was on any of the passenger manifests, as well as Sheikh Raed Salah, leader of the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel. Also some 700 pro-Palestinian activists were on the boats, including 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan Maguire of Northern Ireland, European legislators and Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein, 85.
The six-ship flotilla began the journey on May 30, 2010. Before dawn the following morning, the vessels came into contact with the Israeli navy in international waters off the coast of Gaza. The Aljazeera satellite channel reported by telephone from the Turkish ship leading the flotilla that Israeli navy forces fired at the "Blue Marmara Ship"(Mavi Marmara Gemisi) and boarded it. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says the soldiers were attacked with knives and clubs as they boarded. It says soldiers opened fire after a protester grabbed a weapon from one of the commandos and fired on one or more of the commandos. Organizers of the flotilla said the troops opened fire as soon as they stormed the ships. Reports are of up to 16 people being killed along with dozens of injuries.
In August, the Israeli military arrested several Israeli soldiers, accusing them of selling laptops that belonged to the passengers.
Controversy.
Free Gaza Movement founder, Greta Berlin has been accused of being antisemitic following a controversial tweet, originating from her Facebook account, and published under the account of the Free Gaza Movement. The tweet read “Zionists operated the concentration camps and helped murder millions of innocent Jews" and contained a link to a video of that name, a speech by conspiracy theorist Eustace Mullins asserting that Zionists are responsible for the Holocaust and are admirers of Hitler. The Free Gaza Movement later deleted the tweet. Berlin apologized once the post became known to a wider audience. She declared that she had "shared it without watching it," and she implied no endorsement of Mullins' antisemitic views. She wrote she intended to post the video and comment in a private Facebook group where she had been participating in a discussion of similar propaganda. Larry Derfner published a statement by sixteen people stating that "ours is a small and secret Facebook group, 37 members strong" and that the group had been discussing "the role of the Zionist movement during the Holocaust" when Berlin posted her remarks. In response the Jewish Voice for Peace group, which was co-organizing events with the Free Gaza Movement and Berlin, has distanced itself from Berlin and the Free Gaza Movement.
Reception.
Jeffrey Goldberg wrote that the Free Gaza Movement is "the leading edge of the international campaign to delegitimize Israel and bring about its end as the national home of the Jewish people," and that they are "a hypocritical organization" he argues since they protest Israel's part of the blockade but not the Egyptian blockade of Gaza.

<doc id="18666533" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18666533" title="Panemone windmill">
Panemone windmill

A panemone windmill is a type of vertical axis wind turbine. It has a rotating axis positioned vertically, while the wind-catching blades move parallel to the wind. By contrast, the shaft of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) points into the wind while its blades move at right-angles to the wind's thrust. That is, a panemone primarily uses drag whereas the blades of a HAWT use lift.
Historically the earliest known wind machine was made by the Persians and it was the panemone design, consisting of a wall, with slits, surrounding a vertical axle containing four to eight fabric sails. As the wind blew, the sails would turn the axle, which was in turn connected to grain grinders or some form of water transportation device (though little is known of the actual details of such methods).
History.
No one knows when people first built windmills to do work. The first instance may have been in China more than 2,000 years ago, but archaeologists have found no definite record of their use there before 1219 AD. The earliest recorded windmill design found was Persian in origin, and was invented around 500–900 AD. This design was the panemone, with vertical lightweight wooden sails attached by horizontal struts to a central vertical shaft. It was first built to pump water, and subsequently modified to grind grain as well.
Before becomming a slave to Calif Umar, Pīrūz Nahāvandi used to design and build wind mills. In the 9th. century AD., Pīrūz brought a complaint to Umar about the high tax charged from him by his master Mughirah. Umar wrote to Mughirah and inquired about the tax; Mughirah's reply was satisfactory, but Umar held that the tax charged from Abu Lulu was reasonable, owning the to his daily income. Umar then is reported to have asked Abu Lulu to design a windmill for him, in which Pīrūz replies, " By God, I will build this mill of which the World will talk".
Operation.
The vanes of a panemone are moved by the wind in a circle to turn the drive shaft. To accomplish this they must move with the wind only while on one side of the circle, and move against the wind on the other side. To prevent the vanes moving upwind from being blown back by the wind, one half of the panemone may be shielded, or else the vanes may be attached so that they can turn edge-on to the wind when the wheel is moving them upwind.
Efficiency.
Wind-harnessing devices which rely on drag reach their maximum efficiency if the collector is pushed away from the wind. Because the wind panels do no work while returning to the upwind side of the device, the rotor in the Persian panemone design can only take energy from wind striking half the collection area (see diagram).
The panemone is one of the least efficient types of wind turbine. Despite this it is also one of the most commonly re-invented and patented forms.

The men's points race at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on August 16 at the Laoshan Velodrome. 
This track cycling event consisted of a single race in which the cyclist with the most points at the end of the race won. This race was a 40 kilometre, 160 lap race. During the race, cyclists could score points in two ways; The first way to score points is to lap the group. Each time a cyclist gained a full lap on the peloton, he scored 20 points. If a cyclist lost a full lap to the peloton, however, he lost 20 points. The other method of scoring points was to place in the intermediate sprints occurring every 10 laps. The first four cyclists in each of the sprints scored points with the first finisher receiving 5 points, the second 3, the third 2, and the fourth 1 point.
Among the medal favorites were Joan Llaneras (Spain), Vasil Kiryienka (Belarus), and the defending Olympic champion Mikhail Ignatiev (Russia).

The pre-event favorite to win the gold medal was the defending Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins of Great Britain, who managed to retain the title, setting a new Olympic record in the preliminary round.
Qualification.
Eighteen cyclists qualified for this event. Bradley Wiggins (Great Britain), the defending Olympic champion, qualified for winning the individual pursuit at the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. Volodymyr Dyudya (Ukraine) qualified at the late 2007 UCI World Cup event in Sydney, winning the individual pursuit there. The qualifier by way of the UCI B World Championship was Alexandr Pliuschin (Moldova). Jenning Huizenga (Netherlands), Taylor Phinney (United States), Phillip Thuaux (Australia), Sergi Escobar Roure (Spain), Alexander Serov (Russia), and David O'Loughlin (Ireland) qualified based on UCI rankings. The rest of the field was formed by berths given to the ten nations that qualified in the team pursuit. This resulted in Great Britain, Australia, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine, and Russia each having two competitors in this event.
Competition format.
The eighteen cyclists were matched into nine two-man heats. The riders start on opposite sides of the track from one another, held in place by a starting gate until the race begins. While the objective is ostensibly to catch the other rider on the track, victory is most commonly determined by the faster time to cover 4,000 meters. The winners of each individual heat did not matter in the preliminaries - it was instead the overall eight fastest times which would advance to the match round.
In the match round, the top eight riders from the preliminaries were matched together, 1 vs. 8, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 6, and 4 vs. 5, for the semifinals. In the semifinals, the winner of each match advanced to race for a medal; the two fastest raced for gold and silver, while the two slower winners faced each other for the bronze.

The women's points race at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place on August 18 at the Laoshan Velodrome. 
This track cycling event consists of a single race. This race is a 25 kilometre, 100 lap race. During the race, cyclists can score points in two ways; the cyclist with the most points at the end of the race wins. The first way to score points is to lap the group. Each time a cyclist gained a full lap on the peloton, she scored 20 points. If a cyclist lost a full lap to the peloton, however, she would lose 20 points. The other method of scoring points was to place in the intermediate sprints, held every 10 laps. The first four cyclists in each of those sprints would score, with the first finisher getting 5 points, the second 3, the third 2, and the fourth 1 point.

Whistle tip

Whistle tips, also referred to as whistler tips, or whistlers, are modified vehicle exhaust pipes that generate a whistling sound during the operation of a motor vehicle that can often be heard up to a mile away.
The whistle tip is a small metal plate with a central hole that is welded into the inner tip of the exhaust pipe. As exhaust gases are forced through the exhaust system under pressure, they pass through the hole and generate a whistling sound similar to a steam locomotive whistle. This fad began in Oakland; the origin of the technique reportedly began with A-1 Muffler, Brake, and Radiators.
California.
In 2002, San Leandro, California redrafted its noise ordinance to ban the devices. The Oakland Police Department began cracking down on them by interpreting state laws as including tinkering with mufflers. The Berkeley City Council supported a measure by Assemblywoman Wilma Chan (D-Alameda) introduced a bill into the California State Assembly in 2003 which would effectively ban whistle tips in California. The bill was passed 22–15 by the state senate and then signed into law by Governor Gray Davis, going into effect on January 1, 2004. While violators will be subject to fines of $250 and businesses that install them can be fined up to $1,000, surcharges and enforcement fees will bring it up to $850 and $3,400, respectively. The ban has been outfitted by a California Department of Motor Vehicles prohibited listed as division 12, chapter 5, article 2, section 27150.3.
Internet culture.
Whistle tips were popularized by an Internet phenomenon; a KRON-TV interview in which an Oakland man nicknamed Bubb Rubb defended and demonstrated the use of whistle tips went viral and was the subject of derivative works on websites such as YTMND.

USS Buckeye (AN-13)

USS "Buckeye" (AN-13/YN-8) was an "Aloe"-class net laying ship which was assigned to serve the U.S. Navy during World War II with her protective anti-submarine nets.
Built in Portland, Oregon.
"Buckeye" (YN-8) was laid down on 17 March 1941 at Portland, Oregon, by the Commercial Iron Works; launched on 26 July 1941; sponsored by Miss Sara Ann Tefler; and placed in service on 5 September 1941, Lt. Elias Johnson, USNR, in charge.
World War II service.
North Pacific operations.
After fitting out at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, "Buckeye" began duty in the 13th Naval District. She tended nets there until the fall of 1942. At that time, the ship was transferred to the Alaska Sector based at Dutch Harbor. 
While stationed there, she was placed in full commission on 26 December 1942, Lt. Comdr. Elias Johnson, USNR, in command. She continued to tend nets and buoys in the Aleutian Islands, first at Dutch Harbor and, after May 1943, at recently captured Attu. On 1 January 1944, "Buckeye" was re-designated "AN 13". During the summer of 1944, the net layer received orders to Seattle, Washington, for an overhaul that she completed between 24 July and 11 September.
West Pacific operations.
Following a round-trip voyage from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii and back, "Buckeye" was stationed at the Naval Net Depot at Tiburon, California, near San Francisco, California, as ready duty ship and standby vessel for emergency repairs. That duty lasted until 27 January 1945 when she was transferred to Service Squadron (ServRon) 6 of the U.S. 7th Fleet. 
During February and March, the net layer stopped at Pearl Harbor, Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, Manus in the Admiralty Islands, and Hollandia on New Guinea before arriving in the Philippines in April. Initially, she served in Leyte Gulf but, later that summer moved to Luzon where she operated in Manila Bay and Subic Bay.
Post-war activity.
"Buckeye" spent the remainder of her active career at Luzon. On 17 July 1946, the ship went aground in Subic Bay. With the assistance of , she was refloated on 29 July and was towed to Alava Dock for repairs.
Post-war inactivation.
She was still undergoing repairs at the end of 1946 and, apparently, they were never completed. She went out of commission at Subic on 4 March 1947. Later transferred to the Pacific Reserve Fleet group berthed at San Diego, California, she remained there until 1963 when she was turned over to the U.S. Maritime Administration for lay up in Suisun Bay, California
Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1963. She remained at the Suisun Bay facility until 5 May 1976 at which time she was reacquired by the Navy for use as a salvage training hulk. Her status was unknown.

The individual dressage at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place between August 14 and 19, at the Hong Kong Sports Institute. 
The first round of the individual dressage competition is the same FEI Grand Prix Test used for the team dressage event. The Grand Prix Test consists of a battery of required movements that each rider and horse pair performs. Five judges evaluate the pair, giving marks between 0 and 10 for each element. The judges' scores were averaged to give a final score for the pair.
The top 25 individual competitors in that round advance to the individual-only competitions, though each nation was limited to three pairs advancing. This second round consisted of a Grand Prix Special Test, which used the same movements as the first round's Grand Prix Test but required the pair to complete them in a shorter time. The 15 best pairs in the Grand Prix Special Test advanced to the final round. In that round, the Grand Prix Freestyle Test, competitors designed their own choreography set to music. Judges in that round evaluated the artistic merit of the performance and music as well as the technical aspects of the dressage. Final scores were based on the average of the Freestyle and Special Test results.

Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Individual eventing

The individual eventing at the 2008 Summer Olympics took place between August 9 and 12 2008 at the Hong Kong Sports Institute. 
Individual eventing consisted of four phases: dressage, cross-country, and two phases of show-jumping. Scores from each phase were converted into penalty points, which were summed to give a score.
In the dressage portion, the pair performed in front of three judges. The judges gave marks of between 0 and 10 for each of ten required elements; the scores for the judges were averaged to give a score between 0 and 100. That score was then subtracted from 100 and multiplied by 1.5 to give the number of penalty points.
The cross-county portion consisted of a 4.56 kilometer course with 29 obstacles. The target time was eight minutes; pairs received .4 penalty points for every second above that time. They also received 20 penalty points for every obstacle not cleanly jumped.
The final phases were show-jumping; pairs had to negotiate a course of obstacles. The pair received 4 penalty points for each obstacle at which there was a refusal or a knockdown of the obstacle. One penalty point was also assessed for each second taken above the maximum time for the course. 
The top 25 pairs after the first jumping portion (limited to three pairs per nation) took part in a second phase of jumping; the scores from this jumping final were added to the scores of the first three phases to give a grand final.
The results of the individual phase were also used in the team eventing event, though that event did not use the second jumping phase.
Results.
The total score for each horse and rider was the sum of the total penalty points earned in the various phases of competitions. The pair with the lowest number of penalty points was victorious.
Dressage.
For the dressage portion of the competition, horse and rider pairs performed series of movements that were evaluated by judges. Judges gave marks of 0 to 10 for each movement, subtracting points for errors. The score for each judge was represented by a percentage of marks possible that were gained. Scores from the three judges were averaged for an overall percentage. This was then subtracted from 100 and multiplied by 1.5 to determine the number of penalty points awarded for the round.
Cross country.
The cross-county portion consisted of a 4.56 kilometer course with 29 obstacles. The target time was eight minutes; pairs received .4 penalty points for every second above that time. They also received 20 penalty points for every obstacle not cleanly jumped.

Langdon Hall

Langdon Hall is a building on the campus of Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama of the Greek revival style. Built in 1846 as the chapel for the Auburn Female College (today Auburn High School) and moved to the Auburn University campus in 1883, Langdon Hall is the oldest building in the city of Auburn, and today houses an auditorium and office space for Auburn University staff. Before the Civil War, Langdon Hall served as the location for a series of debates on the question of Southern secession, involving William Lowndes Yancey, Alexander Stephens, Benjamin Harvey Hill, and Robert Toombs. Langdon Hall is named for Charles Carter Langdon, a former mayor of Mobile, Alabama, Alabama Secretary of State, and a trustee of Auburn University from 1872–1889.
History.
Early history.
Langdon Hall was built as the chapel for the Auburn Female College (later the Auburn Masonic Female College and today Auburn High School) in 1846. Prior to the chapel's construction, public lectures were held in the Methodist church, then town's only public hall. Public feeling was that such lectures were inappropriate for a church, and members of the congregation contributed funds for the building's construction. The chapel was sited across from the Methodist church, on the current northeast corner of Gay Street and Magnolia Avenue (). Upon construction, the chapel held the largest auditorium in east Alabama, and as such served as the regional center for lectures and political debates. The lower level of the chapel held the Female College's chemistry laboratory, which was expanded in the 1850s by professor John M. Darby to produce the patent disinfectant "Darby's Prophylactic Fluid". When the East Alabama Male College (today Auburn University) opened in 1859, Darby taught joint chemistry classes in the chapel jointly with the Female College students.
Secession debates.
By the latter part of the 1850s, the chapel became commonly used for political debates over the question of whether the Southern states should secede from the United States. In May 1859, the chapel held the nominating convention of the Democratic Party for the 3rd Congressional District of Alabama, nominating David Clopton, a States' Rights Democrat, for Congress. In 1860, a major debate was held in the chapel involving Clopton, Seaborn Jones, Benjamin Harvey Hill, Alexander Stephens, Robert Toombs, William G. Brownlow, and William Lowndes Yancey. In that day-long debate, Clopton, Jones, and Hill debated in the morning session, with Stephens arguing against secession to open the afternoon. Toombs followed, supporting the states' rights position, but the anti-secession arguments of Brownlow seemed to win the debate for the pro-Union side. Yancey—ill in Montgomery—was not in attendance for most of the day, but as the anti-secessionists gained the upper hand as the day wore on, a special train was sent to bring him to Auburn. As the debate prepared to wrap up in the early evening, Yancey finally arrived, extemporaneously speaking for an hour and a half on the arguments for secession. Yancey's oratory proved sufficient to carry the day for the secessionists, and the country moved one step closer to Civil War.
Move and reconstruction.
The reconstructed Langdon Hall now had woodworking and mechanical engineering laboratories in the old chemistry lab; a dynamo built there allowed the auditorium above to be lit with electric lights in 1888. When the A&M college's main building burned in 1887, the Langdon auditorium was temporarily divided into four classrooms and an assembly room, and in 1892 the half-century-old tower was removed and the building was bricked.
20th century to today.
By the early twentieth century, Langdon Hall had become the social center of the campus. Langdon hosted classes, motion pictures, commencement exercises, music performances, and pep rallies. When the engineering department completely moved out of Langdon in 1921, the lower floor housed the Home Economics Department; in 1924, that same floor became a YMCA, and in 1933, the student center. The auditorium was remodeled in 1950, and later, the lower floor was converted to offices.

Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve

Bao Bolong (also "Baobolong", "Bao Bolon" or "Baobolon") Wetland Reserve is a national park in the Gambia. Established in 1996 it covers 220 square kilometres.
The Wetland Reserve is located on the north bank of the River Gambia, approximately 100 km (52 nautical miles) from the river mouth. The name is derived from the Bao Bolon tributary that rises in Senegal and enters the River Gambia. It extends from the River Gambia north to the Senegalese border along the Baobolon tributary.
History.
On 1 January 1993, an area of 35 km² was first declared as "Bao Bolong National Reserve". From 16 September 1996 on, with an extended area of 220 km² (200 km² according to other sources), it was the first reserve in the Gambia to be acknowledged as a wetland area worth of protection according to the Ramsar Convention: "Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve". Since 1975, this convention, whose draft had been iniated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), protects the habitat of water birds and Charadriiformes. For other nature reserves in the country, like Tanbi Wetland Complex or Niumi National Park (NNP), a Ramsar acknowledgement is also being aimed at by the Gambian authorities. As with NNP, it is intended to extend Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve across the border and to jointly administrate the area with Senegalese authorities.
Geography.
The reserve features a length of 22 kilometres and an approximate width of nine km. The western part is located in the "Central Baddibu" district while the eastern part adheres to "Upper Baddibu", both of which belonging to the North Bank Division.
Chiefly, the reserve is made up of the river Bao Bolong's estuary, one of the bigger tributaries of the river Gambia. It is located about 100 km away from the Gambia's mouth into Atlantic Ocean. The roughly 100 km long Bao Bolong river's spring is situated in Senegal. Furthermore, BBWR includes the rivers "Salokini Bolong", "Mandon Bolong", "Duntu Malang Bolong", "Tanku Bolong" and "Katchang Bolong".
The Gambia river thereby formes the southern boundayr of the protected area. Approximately two kilometres away on the opposite bank of the river, the roughly 115 km² large Kiang West National Park is located. A some two and a half kilometres wide zone of dense mangrove forest adjoines to the river. To the west lies the town of Salikenne (population about 4,000), which is also located near the Dobo Forest Park of 7.32 km². At the western border, the Jalabiro Forest Park of 0.59 km² can moreover be found.
The northern edge is bordered by the north bank road, Gambia's secondmost important highway. Along this road and the fork to Salikenne, several smaller towns like "Nja Kunda", "Minti Kunda", "Kekuta Kunda", "No Kunda", "Konti Kunda Sukoto", "Konti Kunda Nji" and "Illiassa" are situated. In the east, following a fork of nine km length from the north bank road, the town of "Katchang" of 1,700 residents can be reached. Farafenni, with a population of more than 30,000 being the division's largest city, lies roughly 18 km outside the outer limits of BBWR to the east. Summed up, there are 25 small towns which are situated at the wetland reserve's boundaries, one among them being inside the park limits proper. The inhabitants of these towns conduct fishery for personal requirements and their stock graze inside BBWR. Furthermore, they collect timber and fire wood there.
The terrain is flat, the highest elevation is cited with 12 metres above mean sea level.
Flora and fauna.
Ecosystems.
Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve includes a rich fauna and flora within multiple ecosystemss. Important, protected tree species are pointed out by the "Ramsar Information Sheet", such as "Pterocarpus erinaceus", "Parinari macrophylla", the ana tree, wild mango trees ("Cordyla africana") and Néré ("Parkia biglobosa").
Mangroves.
Only in the mangrove forest of Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve the mangrove trees of the Senegambia region reach a height of 20 metres. The species "Rhizophora racemosa", red mangrove ("Rhizophora mangle") and black mangrove ("Avicennia germinans") are widespread among them.
Salt marshes.
In the salt marshes, e.g. the succulent "Sesuvium portulacastrum" and grasses like"Sporobolus spicatus", "Paspalum vaginatum" as well as "Diplachne fusca" can be found. In the savanna, which at times is flooded, "Phragmites karka", "Echinochloa pyramidalis" and paper reed are very common.
Savannah.
In the Savannah, trees like "Daniellia oliveri", "Terminalia albida", "Bombax costatum and others are to be found. Among the shrubs one will encounter several species of figs, "Physostigma thonningii", "Terminalia avicennoides", "Anthostema senegalense" and "Nauclea latifolia". As of grasses, "Andropogon tectorum" and Gamba grass ("Andropogon gayanus"), "Beckeropsis uniseta" and "Pennisetum subangustum" are common.
Avifauna.
The Gambia is frequently visited by ornithologists as more than 540 species of birds have been described there in topic literature. Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve is one of the major targets for tourists and scientists who intend to explore the Gambia's manifold avifauna. Among the birds of BBWR, which include 268 species pf 62 families, the "Ramsar Information Sheet" exemplarily lists the following:
Typical for a wetland, BBWR is the habitat of many water birds, which also include geese. Among them Comb Duck ("Sarkidiornis melanotos", Spur-winged Goose ("Plectropterus gambensis"), White-faced Whistling Duck ("Dendrocygna viduata"), Garganey ("Anas querquedula"), Northern Pintail ("Anas acuta"), African Pygmy Goose ("Nettapus auritus") and the Northern Shoveler ("Anas clypeata").
The order of Ciconiiformes is represented by birds like Western Reef Heron ("Egretta gularis"), Little Egret ("Egretta garzetta"), Woolly-necked Stork ("Ciconia episcopus"), Hammerkop ("Scopus umbretta"), Squacco Heron ("Ardeola ralloides"), Little Bittern ("Ixobrychus minutus"), Goliath Heron ("Ardea goliath"), Geat Egret ("Egretta alba", Marabou ("Leptoptilos crumeniferus"), Night Heron ("Nycticorax nycticorax"), Grey Heron ("Ardea cinerea"), Cattle Egret ("Bubulcus ibis") and the Sacred Ibis ("Threskiornis aethiopicus"). With their long legs, this division of birds searches the river banks for food.
The brackish water areas feature Charadriidae. Spur-winged Lapwing ("Hoplopterus spinosus"), Little Stint ("Calidris minuta") and Common Sandpiper ("Actitis hypoleucos") can be found.
Among the colourful family of kingfishers, who preferably occur near open water, the Woodland Kingfisher, Pied Kingfisher ("Ceryle rudis"), Swallow-tailed Bee-eater ("Merops hirundineus"), Giant Kingfisher ("Ceryle maxima"), Malachite Kingfisher ("Alcedo cristata") and the Blue-breasted Kingfisher ("Halcyon malimbica") are notable.
Equally colourful are the west African examples of Starlings. Among them, the Violet-backed Starling ("Cinnyricinclus leucogaster") and the Long-tailed Glossy-starling ("Lamprotornis caudatus") can be found inside the Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve.
The Coraciiformes include the Abyssinian Ground-hornbill ("Bucorvus abyssinicus") and the European Roller ("Coracias garrulus").
Also species of parrots can be found in west Africa, among them are the Senegal Parrot ("Poicephalus senegalus") and the Rose-ringed Parakeet ("Psittacula krameri").

Souper Bowl of Caring

The Souper Bowl of Caring utilizes Super Bowl weekend in America to mobilize young people to fight hunger and poverty in their local communities. Its vision is to transform Super Bowl weekend (the weekend of the first Sunday in February) into America's largest youth-led weekend of giving and serving. Young people collect monetary and food donations during the week leading up to Super Bowl Sunday. 100% of the money and food is then given directly to local charities of the group's choice.
Started at Spring Valley Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina, the Souper Bowl of Caring has branched out to include schools, businesses and congregations of all faiths. Together, they have raised more than $50 million in monetary and food donations. In 2008 alone, more than 14,000 groups collected over $10 million.
The Souper Bowl of Caring has gained national attention, securing partnerships with nine different NFL Teams, in addition to finding National Advocates in former President and Mrs George H.W. Bush and former President and Mrs Jimmy Carter.
History.
The Souper Bowl of Caring began in 1990 with a simple prayer said by Reverend Brad Smith of Spring Valley Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina: 
22 churches raised $5,700 in the first year. The number of groups involved has steadily grown each year, and so has the amount raised and put back into the communities.
Service Blitz.
On the Saturday before the Super Bowl, Service Blitzes are held in many communities. This is a day of service in which young people from the area come together to volunteer at a local charity. This gives the participants exposure to the cause they are fighting: poverty, hunger, homelessness and injustice. Some communities sponsor local events to raise awareness, others get their youth group or club involved with a soup kitchen to have a hands-on experience.
National Youth Advisory Board.
Although the Souper Bowl of Caring is led by adults, the basis of the organization is its association with young people. Therefore, in 2007, a National Youth Advisory Board (NYAB) was created to bring youth ambassadors of the Souper Bowl to local communities around America. The board is composed of 15-20 high school students from around the country who serve as youth spokespersons to the media, lead and advise their respective communities, assist the Souper Bowl of Caring by providing ideas and suggestions and represent the Souper Bowl in a positive manner. Additionally, they attend two meetings to prepare for the upcoming event.

The DecoTurf surface rendered the event a hardcourt competition. Matches were in best-of-3 sets, except for the final which was in best-of-5 sets. No tiebreak was played in the final set.
Runner-up Fernando González of Chile became the first male tennis player to win a medal in the event in consecutive Olympiads since the reintroduction of the sport in 1988. The last Olympian to accomplish the feat was Charles Winslow, although his medals were 8 years apart, due to the cancellation of the 1916 Summer Olympics.

Dean C. Jessee

Dean Cornell Jessee (born 1929) is a historian of the early Latter Day Saint movement and leading expert on the writings of Joseph Smith, Jr.
Biography.
Jessee was one of the sons of Phillip Cornell Jessee and Minerva Boss. He was raised in Springville, Utah as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He served an LDS mission to Germany. 
In 1959, Jessee received his Master of Arts in LDS church history from the College of Religion at Brigham Young University (BYU), writing his thesis on the controversial topic of Mormon fundamentalism (D. Michael Quinn claims BYU restricted access to this paper for several years.) He then taught LDS Seminary for four years at West High School in Salt Lake City. 
In his career, Jesse was a respected archivist, editor and historian, as well as an authority on early Mormon handwriting. Davis Bitton called him one of the "historians who are deeply familiar with the sources on Mormon origins [yet still find it possible to remain in the fold." In addition to his mission, Jessee has served in his local Salt Lake City congregation as a home teacher and counselor of the high priest group, as well as a stake family history coordinator.
Jessee married Margaret June Wood and they had eight children and reside in Salt Lake City. Jessee's younger brother Donald served in the LDS Church as president of the Oregon Portland Mission and as a Regional Representative.
Church Historian's Office.
In 1964, Jessee was hired by the Church Historian's Office under Joseph Fielding Smith as an archivist in the church historical archives. 
While Leonard J. Arrington was researching a book on the Mormon development of western America, he met Jessee in the church archives during 1967. As a cataloguer of manuscripts, Jessee informed Arrington of many useful documents in the archive that historians had not yet studied. Arrington later recalled that at the time Jessee was "Intelligent, well-informed, hardworking, and modest," and that "he knew more about the documents of LDS history than any other person."
In the late 1960s, Jessee was invited by Truman G. Madsen, at BYU's Institute of Mormon Studies, to publish articles on Joseph Smith and early Mormon history in "BYU Studies". This began Jessee's research and publication in early Mormon manuscripts and historical documents. 
In 1972, Leonard J. Arrington became the official Church Historian. He requested the transfer of Jessee from the archives to the new History Division, a newly created, impressive team of historians for researching and writing of new Mormon histories. One such work, Jessee's 1974 "Letters of Brigham Young to his Sons", caused Apostle Boyd K. Packer to bring concerns to the First Presidency about the Historical Department's "orientation toward scholarly work," an early sign of the tension that would eventually lead to the History Division's disbandment. Jessee was also assigned by Arrington to locate, collect and transcribe all of Joseph Smith, Jr.'s writings, a work inspired by the "Thomas Jefferson Papers" of the 1950s and those of other Founding Fathers.
In the 1980s, Jessee was a major player in the Historical Department's examinations of important historical documents produced by Mark Hofmann, which were later found to be forgeries. Jessee was considered the preeminent expert on early Mormon handwriting, especially Joseph Smith's, and he authenticated and defended a number of Hofmann's forgeries, including the famous "Salamander Letter". Hofmann's extensive deception of document and forgery experts led him to be called "unquestionably the most skilled forger this country has ever seen".
Jessee served as a research historian in the church's Historical Department until 1981, when he was transferred to the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History at Brigham Young University (BYU). At BYU, he was also an associate professor of history and LDS Church history.
Joseph Smith Papers.
As a Senior Historical Associate then Senior Research Fellow, Jessee served for nineteen years in the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute. During this time he continued his earlier work to produce the papers of Joseph Smith. In 1984, he published most of Smith's own writings and many of his dictations in "The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith". This research continued to expand into two volumes of "The Papers of Joseph Smith", one in 1989 on Smith's autobiographical and historical writings, and the other in 1992 on Smith's journals. 
Jessee's efforts were eventually made an official joint effort of BYU and the LDS Church in 2001, called the Joseph Smith Papers Project. This is intended to be a large multi-volume series, including virtually everything written by Joseph Smith, by his office, or under his direction. That year, Larry H. Miller, a Salt Lake City businessman and philanthropist, began funding the venture. In 2005, Miller announced the goal of completing the project by 2015, "while Dean Jessee is still around", since Jessee was then in his 70s. Jessee is general manager of the project along with Richard Bushman and Ron Esplin.
Writings.
In the 1980s Jessee worked on editing some of Wilford Woodruff's journals, though he never published them.
Reviews.
The following are published reviews of Jessee's writings:
Letters of Brigham Young to His Sons
The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith
The Papers of Joseph Smith

1. History
The Newfoundland School Society was established, following a meeting on 30 June 1823, called by a Newfoundland fish merchant, Samuel Codner in a coffee house in Ludgate Hill to discuss the education of children of poor British settlers in the New World. By 1846 the society was responsible for 116 schools in Newfoundland and Canada.
William Wilberforce became a vice-president. William IV was the first royal patron. This honour has been continued by succeeding monarchs.
Another society was formed to support welfare and missionary work amongst settlers in Australia. With a million people emigrating from Britain between 1815 and 1840, it expanded quickly to other countries. In 1838 it adopted the name The Colonial Church Society.
The Newfoundland School Society and the Colonial Church Society merged in 1851 to form the Colonial Church and School Society. The title was changed in 1861 to the Colonial and Continental Church Society (Col and Con) due to increasing activity in Europe.
Subsequently the Society became involved in the training of theological students in Canada for service in the Arctic and the Far West, worked in Australia with the Bush Church Aid Society, and in many parts of Africa and Asia.
The name of the Society was changed in 1958 to the Commonwealth and Continental Church Society and to the Intercontinental Church Society in 1979 as virtually all the Society’s work was by then being carried on outside Commonwealth countries.
ICS, along with other mission agencies, including South American Mission Society (SAMS), Church Society and Crosslinks has worked in continental Europe for over 150 years. The Diocese in Europe was set up in 1981. ICS was involved in the development of Continental chaplaincies from 1839, beginning at Bagni di Lucca, near Pisa, in Italy. The Colonial and Continental Church Society nominated and financially supported the first Bishop of the Suffragan See of Fulham. Over the years grants were made to both the Bishop of Gibraltar and the Bishop of Fulham. The second Bishop of Fulham (W M Selwyn) was a sitting member of the Colonial and Continental Church Society committee at the time of his consecration.

Grenada–Soviet Union relations

Grenada-Soviet relations refers to the relations between Grenada, and the Soviet Union. Diplomatic relations between Grenada and the Soviet Union were severed in November 1983 by the Governor General of Grenada. Eventually in 2002, Grenada re-established diplomatic relations with the newly formed Russian Federation.
History of relations.
During the New Jewel Movement, the Soviet Union tried to make the island of Grenada to function as a Soviet base, and also by getting supplies from Cuba. On October 1983, during the U.S. invasion of Grenada, U.S. President Ronald Reagan maintained that US Marines arrived on the island of Grenada, which was considered a Soviet-Cuban ally that would export communist revolution throughout the Caribbean. In November, at a joint hearing of Congressional Subcommittee, it was told that Grenada could be used as a staging area for subversion of the nearby countries, for intersection of shipping lanes, and for the transit of troops and supplies from Cuba to Africa, and from Eastern Europe and Libya to Central America. In December, the State Department published a preliminary report on Grenada, in which was claimed as an "Island of Soviet Internationalism". When the US Marines landed on the island, they discovered a large amount of documents, which included agreements between the Soviet Government, and the New Jewel Movement, recorded minutes of the Committee meetings, and reports from the Grenadian embassy in Moscow.

Rhone–Rhine Canal

The Rhone–Rhine Canal is a significant waterway of France, that can be considered to connect the Rhine and the Rhone and thereby the North Sea and the Mediterranean.
There are a number of parts to the canal:
The canal was planned from 1784 onwards but finally originally opened in 1834, although the River Doubs which it incorporated has been significant since earliest times. Changes happened in 1960, with the opening of the enlarged Kembs-Niffer branch at the eastern end and the closure of part of the northern arm. A major project to substantially increase the size of the whole canal to accommodate Rhine-size commercial traffic was abandoned in 1997 and part of the allocated funds were used to modernise navigation on the canal.

Coed Darcy

Coed Darcy is a new village currently being developed adjacent to Llandarcy in Neath Port Talbot county borough, Wales.
Historical background.
The village is being built on brownfield land vacated by a former oil refinery, the Llandarcy Oil Refinery, owned by BP. The oil refinery was the first crude oil refinery in the UK, and was constructed between 1918 and 1922. The refinery produced diesel, kerosene and other products. During the post-war period, the refinery underwent large scale development as demand for products increased to 340,000 tonnes per year. Due to economic changes, it was announced in 1997 that the site would close.
Planned outputs.
The £1.2billion planned community development will comprise 4,000 homes, community facilities, employment space and open space covering . Four new schools (1 Welsh primary, 2 English primaries and 1 secondary) are planned. Part of the development proposals includes a new southern access road linking the village to the Fabian Way (A483) into Swansea.
The construction work is expected to create 3,000 to 4,000 jobs which includes jobs created directly in the construction industry and from related support services. The village is expected to become a home to some 10,000 people once development is complete.
Planning and construction.
The design specification was developed with input from The Prince's Foundation and the village will be developed as an urban village in a similar fashion the Poundbury development, which is hoped will encourage people live and work in the same community. The development is expected to take 20 years to complete.
The name of the village was suggested by members of Coedffranc Community Council. The village takes its name from the local parish of Coedffranc and the neighbouring village of Llandarcy.
On 8 May 2007, it was announced that St. Modwen Properties was appointed as the preferred developer of the site. St. Modwen will lead the redevelopment and reclamation of the brownfield site, which is planned to take seven years. The remediation work involves removing contaminated material from the land which was deposited when the site was used as a refinery. The reclamation work involves removing the remanining unrequired oil refinery infrastructure such as pipeworks, buildings and roads, including the draining of a large reservoir at the northern part of the site. The full completion of the regeneration project is anticipated by 2026-8.
Area one.
Work started on building the first 150 homes and 58 apartments, on of the site in June 2008 on a site at old refinery main entrance designated Area 1. The first properties, designed by Robert Adam, Director at ADAM Architecture were developed by Edward Ware Homes and Atlantic Properties Plc (Atlantic Ware Developments) with construction being carried out by Dawnus Construction. Area One is marketed as Heritage Gate.
Main site.
Construction work on the main site began in November 2012 where 302 houses will be built on what will be the first of three residential neighborhoods on the site.
Controversies.
The development of the village has not been devoid of controversy. The residents' association of the neighbouring village of Llandarcy are concerned that the new development does not swallow up Llandarcy. Concerns were expressed about some green belt land being used up in addition to the brownfield site by the village and the new access road to the Fabian Way. The Countryside Council for Wales is monitoring the development of the village.

The village has a population of 1,000.
History.
In the 6th-9th centuries this area has been inhabited by the Baltic tribe of Yotvingians. The first mention of the settlement comes from 1253 when it was recorded as "Weyze", which was most likely taken from the name of a nearby lake, which in turn was derived from the Lithuanian word "vėžės", or crawfish. In the 14th century there was an inn next to the road from Wyłkowyszki to Sejny. According to legend, in 1409 Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Władysław Jagiełło hunted aurochs here and hence called the place Stumbrinė.
In 1570 the place was granted town status, in 1606 it had 4 streets: Stara, Wierzbołowska, Siemiańska i Sejweńsk. Around 1800 the town was granted the coat of arms and right to build the town hall.

Bananagrams

Bananagrams is a word game invented by Abraham Nathanson of Narragansett, Rhode Island, wherein lettered tiles are used to spell words.
Nathanson conceived and developed the idea for the game with the help of his family. The name is derived from the founding family's claim that it's the "anagram game that will drive you bananas!" Beginning as a family innovation, Bananagrams was made available to the public in January 2006 at the London Toy Fair. The game is similar to the older Scrabble variant Take Two.
Game play involves arranging one's tiles into a grid of connected words faster than one's opponents. The object of the game is to be the first to complete a word grid after the pool of tiles has been exhausted. The tiles come in a fabric, banana-shaped package. Bananagrams is listed as a must-have and one of the top ten best travel games, and it has been listed as a best-seller among toy and gift retailers.
Game play.
If at any time during play, one has a letter or letters that she does not wish to fit into her word arrangement, she can announce "Dump!" and exchange any letter for three tiles from the "bunch".
Play continues with players announcing "Peel!" when they again fit all their tiles into their crossword-style word arrangements until there are not enough remaining tiles in the "bunch" for all players to take one; at this point, the first player to have placed all of his or her tiles into his or her word grid calls out "Bananas!" and is declared the winner if all of his or her words are valid upon inspection.
The letter distribution is as follows:
Comparison with other games.
Bananagrams uses elements of both Boggle and Scrabble. It is similar to Boggle in the sense that game play is simultaneous, yet players build interlocking puzzles similar to those in Scrabble.
Because Bananagrams can be played by players at any (English) reading level, the game is useful for children who are learning to spell, and has been touted as both educational and popular among consumers. An independent psychologist reviewed Bananagrams and expressed her recommendation of Bananagrams as a positive example of creativity stimulation because, perhaps unlike Scrabble, the goal is to play all of one's tiles, which generates a need to configure and reconfigure one's word grid to accept all of the letters.
Bananagrams is also similar to Syzygy, a letter-tile game released in 1997.
Awards.
Bananagrams has won numerous awards for its innovation, popularity among consumers, and educational value:
Online gameplay.
An online version of Bananagrams was developed by Large Animal Games, in partnership with Majesco Entertainment. It ran from 2008 until 2012.
The online version adhered to the same protocol as the tabletop edition, but certain game play adjustments and social features were also available. Players could play live games or send challenges to friends, and share completed games with one another. The game also included solitaire modes and "Banana Café", where the objective was to beat one’s own best time.
The online game version offered players the opportunity to customize the game with "Banana Chip" credits. Banana Chips were earned by playing games and by issuing and winning challenges. They could be spent in the virtual store to purchase new tiles and playing boards, and to buy in-game hints and bonuses to gain an advantage over other players. Multi-tier achievements were also awarded to players in recognition of outstanding skill, and a leaderboard contained information pertaining to other players.

Potje met vet

"Ik heb een potje met vet" ("I've got a jar of fat") is a traditional Dutch song. It was traditionally sung by soldiers but now is very popular for singing during long walks and bus journeys. It can be seen as the Dutch version of the similar English song "99 Bottles of Beer".

List of sequenced plastomes

A plastome is the genome of a plastid, a type of organelle found in plants and in a variety of protoctists. The number of known plastid genome sequences grew rapidly in the first decade of the 21st century. For example, 25 chloroplast genomes were sequenced for one molecular phylogenetic study.
The flowering plants are especially well represented in complete chloroplast genomes. As of March, 2010, all of their orders are represented except Petrosaviales, Pandanales, Liliales, Commelinales, Picramniales, Huerteales, Escalloniales, Bruniales, and Paracryphiales.
Meta-algae and Apicomplexans.
Meta-algae are organisms with photosynthetic organelles of secondary or tertiary endosymbiotic origin, and their close non-photosynthetic, plastid-bearing, relatives. Apicomplexans are a secondarily non-photosynthetic group of chromalveoates which retain a reduced plastid organelle.
photosynthetic Chromalveolates.
Dinoflagellate plastid genomes are not organised into a single circular DNA molecule like other plastid genomes, but into an array of mini-circles.
Nucleomorph Genomes.
In some photosynthetic organisms that ability was acquired via symbiosis with a unicellular green alga (chlorophyte) or red alga (rhodophyte). In some such cases not only does the chloroplast of the former unicellular alga retain its own genome, but a remnant of the alga is also retained. When this retains a nucleus and a nuclear genome it is termed a nucleomorph.
Cyanelle Genomes.
The unicellular eukaryote "Paulinella chromatophora" possesses an organelle (the cyanelle) which represents an independent case of the acquisition of photosynthesis by cyanobacterial endosymbiosis. (Note: the term cyanelle is also applied to the plastids of glaucophytes.)

Cicindela campestris

Cicindela campestris, commonly called the green tiger beetle is a widespread Eurasian species of tiger beetle.
Adult.
Adults are long. The elytra and thorax are green, varying in tone from light to dark, spotted with cream-coloured patches, and in bright sunlight are somewhat iridescent. The eyes are blackish; the legs are brown with whitish hairs. The antennae are long and straight, not clubbed.
Behaviour.
The adults are sun-loving. They live in places with dry soils (sandy or chalky), mostly between May and October at the latitude of Britain. Like other tiger beetles, they run fast on their long legs and are most often seen on bare ground, in Britain typically on heather moorland. They can fly fast, making a loud buzzing noise.
Larva.
The larvae are carnivorous. They dig burrows from where they ambush ground-living insects such as ants.
Distribution.
"Cicindela campestris" is distributed across Europe from Spain in the southwest to Finland in the northeast. Most records are from the UK, Germany, Austria and the south of Sweden. In Britain, records are mainly from dry sandy or heathy areas such as the heathlands of Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset, and the mountains and moorlands of the Scottish Highlands.
Subspecies.
The species is divided into several subspecies:
In culture and art.
A piece of modern classical music by Stephen Andrew Rawle for clarinet, violin and piano is entitled "Opus 43, Cicindela Campestris".
Ecology.
The mollicute bacterium species "Entomoplasma freundtii" (Entomoplasmatales, Entomoplasmataceae) can be isolated from the green tiger beetle.

Clarence Major

Clarence Major (born 1936) is an American poet, painter and novelist.
Biography.
Clarence Major was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1936 and grew up in Chicago. As a teenager he started drawing and painting, writing poetry and fiction.
In his early twenties he started publishing his own literary magazine, "Coercion Review", which featured poets and writers such as Henry Miller, Kenneth Patchen and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. As a teenager he was influenced by the monumental Van Gogh Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago, February 1 – April 16, 1950.
After a stint in the Air Force, two marriages, children, and two divorces, he left the Midwest and moved to New York in December, 1966. His first novel, "All Night Visitors", was published in 1969 and his first collection of poems, "Swallow the Lake" the following year. Major briefly worked as a research analyst for Simulmatics, under the direction of sociologist Dr. Sol Chaneles. Major analyzed news coverage of the 1960s riots. He also did field work on the riots, in Detroit and Milwaukee, before turning, in 1967, to teaching.
First, he taught in Harlem at the New Lincoln School, in a summer program. He later taught modern American literature courses and creative writing workshops in universities. Although he had shown a few paintings in group shows at Gales Gallery in Chicago during the 1960s, his first solo exhibition of paintings was at Sarah Lawrence College in the library in the early 1970s.
During this time he was also giving public readings of his poetry. He served on the editorial staff of several literary periodicals and wrote a regular column for "American Poetry Review". He was the first editor of "American Book Review". He read his poetry at the Guggenheim Museum, the Folger Theatre and in universities, theaters and cultural centers.
He joined the Fiction Collective in 1974. Major edited "High Plains Literary Review" for several years. On a State Department-sponsored trip in 1975 he was a participant at the International Poetry Festival in Struga, Yugoslavia, where he read his work with Leopold Sedar Senghor and other poets from around the world. In 1977, with John Ashbery and other poets from various countries, Major read at the Poetry International in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Although he had been painting all along, after moving to California in 1989 he showed his paintings more frequently in galleries.
In 1991 Major served as fiction judge for the National Book Awards. In 1987 he served twice on the National Endowment for the Arts Awards panels; and in 1997-98 he served as judge for the PEN/Faulkner Award. He has judged state-sponsored literary contests in Ohio, New York, Washington, Colorado and California.
Major is professor emeritus of 20th-Century American Literature at the University of California at Davis. His literary archives are in the Givens Collection of African American Literature, Anderson Library of Rare Books and Manuscripts, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. For what Professor Linda Furgerson Selzer calls a "groundbreaking study" of Clarence Major's art and work, see Keith E. Byerman's book, "The Art and Life of Clarence Major" (ISBN 978-8203-3055-6), Athens: University of Georgia Press (June 2012).
Teaching.
Major has taught literature and/or creative writing at Brooklyn College, Queens College, Sarah Lawrence College, University of Washington, Howard University, University of Maryland, University of Colorado, Temple University, the State University of New York at Binghamton, the University of California at Davis and on a Fulbright-Hays Exchange award he taught American culture at the University of Nice, in France, 1981-1983. He left the University of Colorado in 1989 and he taught at the University of California Davis for eighteen years before his retirement in 2007.
Recognition.
Major won a NationaL Council on the Arts Award for his poetry collection "Swallow the Lake" in 1970, and the following year was awarded a New York Cultural Foundation grant for poetry. "Reflexe et Ossature" (1982), the French translation of "Reflex and Bone Structure" (1975), was nominated for the Prix Maurice Coindreau (1982). "Such Was The Season" (1987) was a Literary Guild book club selection in 1988. The same year "The New York Times Book Review" recommended it on its annual "Summer Reading" list. "Painted Turtle: Woman With Guitar" (1988) was cited by "The New York Times Book Review" as a "Notable Book of The Year" 1988. Major won a Bronze Medal as a finalist for the National Book Award in 1999 for "Configurations: New and Selected Poems 1958-1998" (Copper Canyon Press). He won the Pushcart Prize for the short story "My Mother and Mitch", in 1989. In 2002 he won the Stephen Henderson Poetry Award for Outstanding Achievement. His novel "My Amputations" (1986) won the Western States Book Award and was republished in 2008 with an introduction by Lawrence Hogue. "Dirty Bird Blues" won the Sister Circle Book Award in 1999. Major was awarded the International Literary Hall of Fame award (Chicago State University) in 2001.

Procurator (Roman)

Procurator was the title of various officials of the Roman Empire, posts mostly filled by men of the equestrian order.
Fiscal officers.
A fiscal procurator ("procurator Augusti") was the chief financial officer of a province during the Principate (30 BC - 284 AD). A fiscal procurator worked alongside the "legatus Augusti pro praetore" (imperial governor) of his province but was not subordinate to him, reporting directly to the emperor. The governor headed the civil and judicial administration of the province and was the commander-in-chief of all military units deployed there. The procurator, with his own staff and agents, was in charge of the province's financial affairs. This included (1) the collection of taxes, especially the land tax ("tributum soli"), poll tax ("tributum capitis") and the "portorium", an imperial duty on the carriage of goods on public highways; (2) collection of rents on land belonging to imperial estates; (3) management of mines; and (4) the distribution of pay to public servants (mostly in the military).
The office of fiscal procurator was always held by an equestrian, unlike the office of governor that was reserved for members of the higher senatorial order. The reason for the dual administrative structure was to prevent excessive concentration of power in the hands of the governor, as well as to limit his opportunities for peculation. It was not unknown for friction to arise between governor and procurator over matters of jurisdiction and finance.
As governors.
A "procurator Augusti", however, might also be the governor of the smaller imperial provinces (i.e., those provinces whose governor was appointed by the emperor, rather than the Roman Senate). The same title was held by the fiscal procurators, who assisted governors of the senatorial provinces (known as a "legatus Augusti pro praetore", who were always senators). In addition, procurator was the title given to various other officials in Rome and Italy.

Meet the People

Meet the People (1944) is a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical film made during World War II, and starring Lucille Ball and Dick Powell and featuring Virginia O'Brien, Bert Lahr, Rags Ragland and June Allyson. The film takes its title from a successful Los Angeles stage revue, which ran on Broadway from December 25, 1940 to May 10, 1941. Vaughn Monroe and his orchestra, Spike Jones and his City Slickers, and Virginia O'Brien were also in the original stage cast. O'Brien sings the hit song "Say We're Sweethearts Again".
The phrase "Heavens to Murgatroyd!", later popularized by cartoon character Snagglepuss, was originally said by Bert Lahr in this movie.
Plot.
Welder William "Swanee" Swanson works at a shipyard in Morganville, Delaware. One day he sees the brightly shining Broadway star Julie Hampton speak in front of a crowd of worlers at the yard, and he instantly falls in love with her.
Luckily enough, Julie has promised to go on a date with the man who sells the most war bonds within a certain time limit. Swanee lies to Julie and tells her that he has $7,500 in pledges. He also tells the workers that Julie will kiss every worker who makes additional pledges to him. The crowd goes wild with excitement, and Swanee easily wins the prize.
Swanee drives Julie up to the romantic Inspiration Point in his old car, trying to impress her. He also tells her about the musical he has written together with his cousin John, a U.S.M.C. It is about working men, and he even performs the theme love song for her. He calls the musical "Meet The People". She is impressed enough to show the musical screenplay to a Broadway producer, Monte Rowland, and the producer agrees to stage the play on the condition that he can use old costumes from previous shows.
When the show is rehearsed, Swanee discovers that all the roles have glittery showbiz costumes, and don't look the least like working men. He is disappointed, and demands the costumes to be altered. Monte refuses and cancels the show, hoping that Swanee will surrender and give in.
But he doesn't. Instead he leaves New York in anger, denounces Julie and the showbiz industry, and goes back to Morganville. Julie follows him there, determined to make him change his mind. She starts working at the shipyard as a welder, and finds out that she enjoys the work very much. She also makes a lot of new friends among her colleagues, who are eager to get to know the beautiful star.
Julie continues dating Swanee, and she tells him about her motive for coming with him. She wants to change the show, and hire some out-of-work chorus friends of her to be on stage. Swanee likes the idea, and signs a new deal with Monte. But then he sees Julie posing for promotional photographs in her working outfit, and thinks she makes a mockery of him and his co-workers. He calls her egotistic and refuses to go through with the plans.
Julie doesn't give up. During a pep talk speech to her co-workers at the shipyard, she leaves the microphone on behind the stage, and gets Swanee to confess his feelings for her. Everyone at the shipyard hears his words, and he is laughed at and ridiculed by his colleagues. Swanee calls Julie a hypocrite and storms away.
Problem arises when John is on his way home from the service, because Swanee's uncle Felix has told John that the show he helped write is a hit on Broadway. Swanee has to produce the show somehow, and comes up with the idea to make it on the yard's 300th finished ship anniversary. But Julie refuses to take part, since she is determined on doing a show on her own, with the help of her friends from Broadway.
John is disappointed when he arrives and learns the truth about the fate of Meet The People. When Julie sees the disappointment in his eyes, she changes her mind and starts casting for the musical anyway. She and John stage and rehearse the musical while Swanee, unaware of their preparations, are away looking for funds to back up the musical. When he returns to find she musical is opening, he is delighted and impressed with Julie's work. Julie tells Swanee that she loves him, and they become a couple on stage in time for the musical's grand finale.
Box Office.
According to MGM records the movie earned $670,000 in the US and Canada and $290,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $717,000.
