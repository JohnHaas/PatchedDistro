An unknown saboteur sets a lion loose, terrifying an audience until Hank manages to tame it. Helen accuses him of staging the incident for publicity. She and Randy are infuriated by Hank's refusal to accept their help. Randy's attempt to save money by firing workers and replacing them with a machine that raises the big-top tent is also sabotaged, leading to a death and many suspicions and accusations.
With the bank about to foreclose, Hank goes to television star Steve Allen to seek needed publicity for the circus. A wire walk across Niagara Falls by Zach is also held, amidst fear of additional sabotage. By the time Jeannie finally gets a shot at flying on the trapeze, Hank realizes that Tommy is the culprit, having a history of mental illness and a grudge against the circus. Jeannie's life and the future of the circus is left hanging by a thread.
Production.
Famed circus performer Barbette served on the film as a consultant.

Lobbying controversy.
In December 2011 Lord was caught up in a "sting" by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Independent Newspaper, who posed as representatives of Uzbekistan in a meeting with lobbyist BTP. Lord suggested edits might be made to the country's Wikipedia page to improve its reputation. In footage of the meeting Lord described himself as having a "non-executive" role with BTP, but subsequently explained that he attended the meeting as a favour to BTP's managing director, fellow Liberal Democrat Mark Pursey, and that he had never worked for BTP.

W. Alton Jones

W. Alton Jones (1891 – March 1, 1962), who served as president of the oil and gas conglomerate Cities Service Company (now CITGO), was an influential industrialist, philanthropist, and close personal friend of United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
W. Alton “Pete” Jones was born into a poor Missouri farm family of seven in 1891. In 1920 he became an executive with the energy company Cities Service Company, serving as president from 1940 to 1953. He rose to become one of the highest paid CEOs in the United States.
During World War II, he was a hero of war production by building a secret dynamite production plant in Arkansas, an aviation fuel refinery in Louisiana, and over 3,000 miles of oil pipelines from Texas to the East Coast that were vital to the war effort.
As an important supporter of the Republican Party, he met and became a very close personal friend of President Eisenhower. Jones was killed in the crash of American Airlines Flight 1 in New York City on March 1, 1962, while on his way to join Eisenhower on a fishing trip.
In 1944 he founded the W. Alton Jones Foundation "to promote the well-being and general good of mankind the world". The foundation supported various causes, such as the arts, education, and environmental activism, but split into three separate funds in 2001.
Immediately after his death, Jones' heirs donated his private hunting and fishing retreat (which had hosted President Eisenhower and the King of Nepal) to the University of Rhode Island, creating the W. Alton Jones Campus.

Sunshine (Dragon album)

Sunshine is the third album by New Zealand / Australian rock band Dragon, it was their first album after they had relocated to Sydney in May 1975. "Sunshine" was released in 1977 by CBS Records and peaked at #24 on the Australian national albums charts. The single "This Time" had been released in late June 1976, which peaked at #26 on the Australian national singles charts. The second single "Get that Jive" was the best charting peaking at #13 and the third single "Sunshine" reached #36. The album had US and International releases in 1978 on Portrait Records, with "This Time" called "In the Right Direction" and an alternative cover used (see infobox).
Dragon had released two progressive rock albums in New Zealand but in Sydney they were moving to a rock / pop sound and sent for keyboardist Paul Hewson of rival kiwi group Mammal. Hewson joined Dragon with Marc Hunter on vocals and his older brother Todd Hunter on bass guitar, Neil Storey on drums and Robert M. Taylor on lead guitar. Storey died of heroin overdose in September 1976, aged 22. Their debut single "This Time" had begun charting, they considered disbanding but continued with ex-Mammal drummer Kerry Jacobson to complete the album. The album was dedicated to Neil Storey (1954–1976).
Background.
After Dragon relocated to Sydney in May 1975 they landed a contract with CBS Records when record producer Peter Dawkins caught one of their performances. Dragon co-founder Ray Goodwin left the group in 1975, so Dragon sent for keyboard player Paul Hewson who had a reputation, in New Zealand, as a pop songwriter. Hewson, ex-Mammal, had been scouted by Dragon when they were still in New Zealand but had declined to join. Often courting or creating controversy, the band was rocked by the heroin overdose death of drummer Neil Storey in September 1976, aged 22. By then, their debut single "This Time" had begun charting. After considering disbanding, Todd Hunter consulted with former manager Graeme Nesbitt (ex-Mammal) who advised him to continue and organised for Kerry Jacobson (ex-Mammal) to join on drums.

Wilhelm Molitor

Wilhelm Molitor (pseudonyms Ulric Riesler and Benno Bronner) (born at Zweibrücken in the Rhine Palatinate, 24 August 1819; died at Speyer, 11 January 1880) was a German poet, novelist, canon lawyer and publicist, and Roman Catholic priest. He was a chief promoter of the Catholic movement in the Palatinate.
Life.
After studying philosophy and jurisprudence in Munich and Heidelberg (1836–40), he held various juridical positions in the service of the State from 1843-9. Feeling himself called to the priesthood, he studied theology at Bonn (1849–51) and was ordained priest on 15 March 1851. 
In the same year he became secretary to Nicolaus von Weis, Bishop of Speyer; on 11 November 1857, he was elected canon of the cathedral chapter and, soon after, appointed custos of the cathedral, and professor of archæology and homiletics at the episcopal seminary. 
He took part in the consultations of the German bishops at Bamberg (1867), Würzburg (1868), and Fulda (1869). In 1868 Pope Pius IX summoned him to Rome as a consultor, ahead of the First Vatican Council. 
From 1875-7 he was a member of the Bavarian Landtag. His ultramontane principles made him unacceptable to the Bavarian Government, which in consequence repeatedly prevented his election to the See of Speyer. He founded the "Pfälzicher Pressverein", the daily paper "Rheinpfalz" and the "Katholische Vereinsdruckerei".
Works.

2008 Lhasa violence

The 2008 Lhasa violence was one of a number of violent protests that took place during the 2008 Tibetan unrest.
The Riot.
Tibetan rioters appeared to be targeting shops and vehicles owned by Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group in China, and Hui, who are a Muslim minority. According to the BBC and the "Wall Street Journal", rioters focused on setting fire to and looting businesses owned by them; the "Wall Street Journal" stated that first-hand accounts of their stories have been relatively rare in Western news reports, in part because it is difficult to reach people by phone in Lhasa." Tibetans face similar problems due to the strict controls on media reporting of events in Tibetan areas of China. James Miles, in an interview with CNN, made the following assessment, "What I saw was calculated targeted violence against an ethnic group, or I should say two ethnic groups, primarily ethnic Han Chinese living in Lhasa, but also members of the Muslim Hui minority in Lhasa."
Also according to "The Economist", "The mobs, ranging from small groups of youths (some armed with traditional Tibetan swords) to crowds of many dozens, including women and children, rampaged through the narrow alleys of the Tibetan quarter. They battered the shutters of shops, broke in and seized whatever they could, from hunks of meat to gas canisters and clothing. Some goods they carried away, while other goods were thrown into large fires lit on the street." Little children could also be seen looting a toy shop as well and mobs were attempting to ram the defenses of banks. The mobs also attacked any ethnic Chinese on the streets. James Miles reported seeing a Han Chinese teenage boy plead to a monk to help him hide because of the violence around the city.
"The Guardian" reported that according to a foreign eyewitness account, rioters attacked Han, Muslim Hui and other ethnic minorities. Foreigners were not attacked. With the exception of Tibetan-owned hotels, many other hotels were vandalized and smashed. The foreign eyewitness also reported seeing three rioters repeatedly stabbing an unconscious man. After the Monday deadline, Chinese police announced on loudspeakers that anyone who took part in the violence and gave themselves up would be treated with leniency.
According to the London-based Free Tibet Campaign, an eyewitness in Lhasa saw rioters set a mosque on fire late on Friday night and throw stones at people who appeared to be Hui.
Other Western tourists emerged from Tibet with graphic descriptions of the level of violence that had occurred. Some claimed that they had seen non-Tibetan Chinese, including the elderly, being beaten and stoned to death by groups of Tibetans, supported by the crowd.
Other Events.
An eyewitness stated that police cars, fire engines and other official vehicles were set on fire after anger erupted following the police's dispersal of a peaceful demonstration near a small temple in Lhasa. According to CNN, Police used gunfire and tear gas to break up the protest. "The monks are still protesting. Police and army cars were burned. There are people crying," she said. Tensions in Lhasa increased as the city's three biggest monasteries were sealed off by thousands of soldiers and armed police amid the largest protests in nearly two decades. Chinese authorities reportedly fired warning shots and used tear gas and electric prods to disperse hundreds of protesters, in addition to detaining up to 50 monks. US embassy officials in Beijing told the Associated Press that U.S. citizens had reportedly seen gunfire and rioting in Lhasa. Tibetan exiles quoted in the Times of London report that at least five people had been killed in police firing by March 15.
According to a Tibetan who fled Tibet after the demonstrations in Lhasa, knife-wielding Chinese troops attacked Tibetan demonstrators on March 14, and several demonstrators died from gunshot and knife wounds.
Aftermath.
In the aftermath of the riot, residents appeared to have mixed reactions to the violence. Some Tibetans celebrated by throwing toilet paper that resembled traditional Tibetan scarves over wires across the streets. However, "others appeared aghast at the violence."
Casualties.
The official Chinese media source Xinhua has reported that on March 14 in Lhasa "rioters injured 623 people including 241 police and armed police and killed 18 others. They also set fire to more than 300 locations, mostly private houses, stores and schools, smashed vehicles and damaged public facilities."
The official Chinese media has now published details including names and photographs of some of those they say were killed or injured during the rioting. According to Xinhua, local police have confirmed the identities of 14 out of the 18 "innocent civilians" killed in "Lhasa riots," including one eight-month-old infant and one ethnic Tibetan woman in a fire, set by arson.
Radio Free Asia and the International Campaign for Tibet reported that fresh protests broke out at the Ramoche Temple, situated in the northwest of Lhasa, March 29, 2008, as a 15-member group of diplomats from the United States, Japan and Europe returned to Beijing after a two-day visit to the Tibetan capital. However, independent verification of the protest could not be obtained.

2008 Sichuan riots

In Sichuan province, in an area incorporating the traditional Tibetan areas Kham and Amdo, Tibetan monks and police clashed in riots on 16 March in Ngawa county after the monks staged a protest. It formed part of the 2008 Tibetan unrest and was one of two major events to happen in Sichuan during 2008, the other being the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake in May 2008.
Events.
On 16 March, Tibetan monks staged a protest against its allegedly harsh treatment by the Chinese government. The word got out and the police became involved. The monks and police clashed, killing at least one policeman, and setting fire to three or four police vans. The India-based Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy claimed at least seven people were shot dead; however the claim could not be independently confirmed.
Unverified claims.
There are claims that police shot between 13 and 30 protesters after a police station was set on fire, however reports of deaths are impossible to verify because of the restrictions on journalists.
Crackdown on violence.
Authorities and security forces in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, have locked down a Tibetan neighborhood. The neighborhood is located near the Southwest University for Nationalities and the Wu Hou Temple. The crackdown comes amid unconfirmed reports of Tibetan protests in that section of Chengdu
and a stabbing attack on a Han Chinese man by a Tibetan earlier in the week. Cars and other vehicles are not allowed to drive through the neighborhood, which has a large police presence. The Foreign Correspondents Club of China has reported that Chinese authorities have hindered efforts to report from the bases in Chengdu about Tibetan areas of the province.
Arrests.
On 21, 27 March nuns of the Kirti Monastery in Ngawa county were arrested by Chinese police forces. The information was confirmed by the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung after phonecalls into the region with locals. Troops also blocked roads in nearby Sertar. The London-based Free Tibet Campaign reported that troops had been sent to the county after residents blew up a bridge near the village of Gudu. Arrests have also been reported from Sertar after security forces cracked down on protests.
Further clashes.
On 25 March, Chinese state media citing local authorities reported that one police officer was killed as fresh protests erupted in the Tibetan part of Sichuan. The Xinhua news agency said police were "forced to fire warning shots" and had "dispersed the lawless mobsters." The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy reported that one Tibetan protester had been shot dead by Chinese Police and another was critically injured.
The suicide by two monks in Amdo on 27 and 30 March has been reported by the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy as an act of freeing from oppression. Independent verification is however outstanding.
On 3 April new violence broke out in Sichuan as various sources report. According to Xinhua News Agency at least one government official has been seriously injured. An overseas Tibet activist group said eight people had been killed in the incident. It said police opened fire on hundreds of Buddhist monks and lay people who marched on local government offices to demand the release of two monks detained for possessing photographs of the Dalai Lama. Unidentified eyewitnesses told Radio Free Asia's Tibetan agency that 15 people had been killed in the incident.

Corder House and Sydenham House

Corder House and Sydenham House are two, adjacent, Grade II listed buildings on Fawcett Street, in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England. Designed by Frank Caws in the Neo-Moorish style, they were constructed in brick from 1889–1891 by David and John Rankin with terracotta features by J. C. Edwards of Ruabon.
Corder House.
Corder House was constructed for a local drapery company, Corder's, owned by Alexander Corder. It is four storeys high, including the attic. The building has a ground floor panelled fascia and a cusped arcaded frieze with roll-moulded coping. The projecting canted bays on the arcaded first floor are flanked by narrow lights with Gothic capitals to the pilasters and the elaborate heads over the central lights of the canted bays; all are with paired, mullioned cusped overlights and a dripstring. The second-floor central balustraded balcony has panels with Gothic letters; the curvilinear windows with paired arcaded top lights have shallow canted centres under the balustraded attic balconies. The elliptical-headed cusped attic arches to the recessed windows are flanked by scrolls and pilasters which rise to high shaped gables with terracotta patterns, central oval lights, and raised segmental pediments. The dates 1856 and 1890 are in the outer panels at the eaves level. The steeply pitched roof has a central lantern with Gothic lights and a high, conical roof.
Sydenham House.
Sydenham House is four storeys high, including the attic. It has a moulded ground floor fascia and frieze below a full-width balcony with a stone balustrade. The first floor windows, tripartite in the centre and paired in the outer bays, have upper glazing bars in curvilinear heads below the swags and the second floor balcony which projects in the centre over panelled pilasters defining the first floor central bay. The square-headed second floor lights have raised arches with pendants, the central bay is defined by plain pilasters with scrolled pediment heads under a panelled band and outer scrolled pediments.

2nd (West Africa) Infantry Brigade

The 2nd (West Africa) Infantry Brigade was a World War II unit of the British Army it was formed from battalions of the Royal West African Frontier Force in 1940. The Brigade served in the East African campaign in the early part of the war before seeing action against the Japanese in Burma in 1944–45.
History.
The brigade was originally formed as 4th (Gold Coast) Infantry Brigade but was re-designated 24th (Gold Coast) Infantry Brigade in October 1940. It was involved in the East African Campaign against the forces of the Italian Colonial Empire in Kenya under the command of Brigadier Collen Edward Melville Richards and was attached to the 2nd (African) Division. During the East African Campaign, the brigade was part of Andrew Cunningham's force which attacked from Kenya into Italian Somaliland and then advanced into Ethiopia. After the campaign, in December 1941, the brigade returned to West Africa and was reorganised as an independent brigade group (with attached engineer and artillery units) and designated 2nd (West African) Infantry Brigade.
In October 1942 command of the brigade passed to Brigadier Ernest Western who was to remain in this role until March 1945. In 1944, reorganised once more as an infantry brigade, the 2nd (West African) was attached to the 82nd (West Africa) Division and sailed for Ceylon, where the complete division was assembled on July 20. They then moved to Burma and took part in the third Arakan Campaign in December, 1944 as part of Philip Christison's XV Corps.
It first advanced south along the Kalapanzin valley, then crossed a steep and jungle-covered mountain range to converge with the British 81st (West Africa) Division on Myohaung at the mouth of the Kaladan River. This move forced the Japanese to evacuate the Mayu peninsula which they had held for almost four years, and retreat south along the coast. They continued to advance maintaining pressure, on the Japanese capturing the port of Gwa shortly before the Japanese abandoned Burma. Western was wounded in March 1945 and command of the brigade was given to Brigadier Adam Wilson-Brand.
Formation.
The 2nd (West Africa) Infantry Brigade was made up of the following units:

Villa Leopolda

Villa La Leopolda is a large villa in the French town of Villefranche-sur-Mer on the French Riviera.
History.
Villa La Leopolda in its current incarnation was designed and built from 1929 to 1931 by an American architect, Ogden Codman, Jr., on an estate once owned by King Leopold II of Belgium. Leopold had made the previous estate a present for his mistress Blanche Zélia Joséphine Delacroix, also known as Caroline Lacroix, and it derives its name from him. After Leopold's death, Blanche Delacroix was evicted, and his nephew, King Albert I, became its owner. During World War I it was used as a military hospital.
In 1919, Thérèse Vitali, comtesse de Beauchamp, acquired the property and commissioned modifications. The American architect Ogden Codman, Jr. purchased the dozen existing structures that made up the property including two peasant cottages, and began his architectural magnum opus in 1929. It was complete by 1931, however financial difficulties (and his lavish expenditures) precluded his being able to live in it, so he rented it out to various well-heeled tenants. One famous English couple tried to lease it, but insisted on making changes that were contrary to Codman's aesthetic objectives and strict list of protective clauses. Negotiations in a Paris Hotel room broke down over the many restrictions Codman imposed, and Ogden's response was: "I regret that the House of Codman is unable to do business with the House of Windsor." Codman's extensive designs and construction gave the estate, once a series of unrelated buildings, its current appearance. His neo-Palladian vision, coupled with his in-depth knowledge of historical precedent, resulted in the construction of a spectacular villa with extensive gardens and landscaping. Floor plans, letters, records, and stereo glass-plate views of the newly completed property still exist in the collections of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (aka "Historic New England") At Codman's death in 1951 the estate was sold to Izaak Walton Killam whose wife inherited the place after his death. In the later 1950s she sold it to Fiat president Gianni Agnelli (1921–2003) and Marella Agnelli. Their renovations to the property, obliterated such features as the varied-hued scagliola walls in the "Italian Salon" under buckets of white paint.
By 1988 "La Leopolda" had become one of the domiciles of the banker Edmond Safra. The Safras commissioned Renzo Mongiardino as interior designer, while the second-floor bedrooms were decorated by Mica Ertegun.
The villa appeared in the news in the summer of 2008 with reports of the Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov having purchased the home at a price of approximately €500 million ($736m / £397m). However, the price reported at the occasion of a lawsuit in February 2010 was € 370 million, which still would have made it probably the world's most expensive villa.
However, Prokhorov's spokesman denied that he was the purchaser, and said he refuses to do business in France until he receives an apology for being investigated in a prostitution probe.
In February 2010, a Nice court decided that Prokhorov could not demand back the €39 million down payment made to Mrs. Lily Safra in 2008 and had to pay an additional €1.5 million interest. Lily Safra announced that she would donate the entire sum to a number of institutions focused on medical research, patient care, education, and other important humanitarian causes around the world.
Historical monument.
"La Leopolda" invokes the style of the Belle Époque. It is registered as a French "monument historique".
In popular culture.
The villa was used as the location of Lermontov's villa in 1948 film "The Red Shoes". The heroine climbs the steps to the villa thinking that she's been invited to dinner. Instead she would be given the starring role in the new ballet.
Alfred Hitchcock used "La Leopolda" as a set in his 1955 movie "To Catch a Thief".

Lac de Sylans

Lac de Sylans is a lake at Le Poizat in the Ain department, France.
It is significant for the ruins of one of the 19th century's largest ice harvesting factories and the occasional outflow of water in two directions.
Geography.
The lac de Sylans fills part of the Nantua water gap, which was formed during the last glacial era. The formation of the lake itself is much more recent; it is the result of the collapse of the cliff on the Northern side of the valley a few centuries ago. This huge landslide partially blocked the valley between the ice factory and the source of the Doye, above les Neyrolles, blocking the river that was flowing along what is now the bed of the lake, causing the lake to form. Today the water percolates through the landslide debris to form the source of the Doye.
In dry summers the level of the lake can fall by 5m, whereas during wet periods, the level can rise to a point where the water also flows out towards Saint-Germain-de-Joux and Bellegarde-sur-Valserine, at the other end of the water gap, via the Combet stream, which flows into the Semine then the Valserine, which flows into the Rhône.
History.
Ice Harvesting Factory.
The ice factory was built in 1865 after Joachim Moinat had the idea to use the very pure ice that covered the lake every year in his café. This purity meant the ice could be used as is without purification. To store the ice, he built a wooden hut. In 1875, a second building was erected. This one was equipped with cavity walls in which the cavity was filled with sawdust for better thermal insulation.
In 1885, he sold the business to the "société des glacières de Paris". There followed, between 1890 and 19010, the construction of further buildings in wood then in stone. These building served as dwellings offices, a canteen, a stable and a repair workshop.
Later when the Haut-Bugey railway line was opened, 20 to 30 wagons loaded with 10 tonnes each departed every day of the summer for Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Toulon et even Alger. These loads were covered with a jute mat, straw and a tarpaulin for insulation. Losses were reasonable, as for 10 tonnes shipped, about 8 arrived in Paris.
By 1880, the factory was producing 300,000 tons per year on average. Machines able to make ice from water appeared around 1900. The warmer winters of 1911 to 1913 and the First World War saw an end to production in 1917.
Today, only a few traces remain of what was one of the largest ice factories of the 19th century. Some restoration has taken place, revealing how the warehouses might have been.
Transport Infrastructure.
Running on each side of the lake are two important transport arteries. On the south side the Haut-Bugey railway line, initially a regional line from Bourg en Bresse to Bellegarde, but rebuilt in 2010 to carry TGVs from Geneva to Paris
On the northern side the A40 autoroute connecting Switzerland and Northern Italy (via the Mont Blanc tunnel) to France.

This gave her the third seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Sigrid Romero in the first round, beating the archer from Colombia 108-98. In the second round Joo was too strong for Natalia Valeeva (110-108) and via Bérengère Schuh (109-104) in the third round she advanced to the quarter finals. There she faced 27th seed, but local Chinese favourite Zhang Juanjuan who won the confrontation with 106-101. Zhang went on to upset Joo's South Korean team mates Park and Yun Ok-Hee in the semi final and final to take the gold medal.
Together with Park Sung-Hyun and Yun Ok-Hee she also took part in the team event. With her 664 score from the ranking round combined with the 673 of Park and the 667 of Yun the South Korean team was in first position after the ranking round, which gave them a straight seed into the quarter finals. With 231-217 they were far too strong for the Italian team. The 231 also was a new World Record. In the semi final against France they scored 213 points with the French scoring 184, securing their final spot. Opponent China came with a strong 215 points performance, but South Korea won the gold with a 224 points score.

Touch Football – Australian Nationals

The Australian National Championships was a touch football competition between the Australian states which ran from 1980 to 1995. The finals of this competition were almost always played between Queensland and New South Wales, the two most dominant touch playing states, with the Australian Capital Territory also performing strongly. The 'one sided' nature of the competition was the major reason for its replacement by the National Touch League format from 1997.

Jacobus Capitein

Jacobus Elisa Johannes Capitein (born ca. 1717; died 1747) was a Dutch Christian minister of Ghanaian birth who was one of the first known sub-Saharan Africans to study at a European university and one of the first Africans to be ordained as a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. He is credited with spreading the use of the written word in his native Ghana.
Though a former slave, Capitein wrote a dissertation defending the right of Christians to keep slaves.
Early years.
Capitein, whose African name is unknown, was forcibly taken from his parents in present-day Ghana in 1725, at the age of 8, and sold as a slave to a Dutch captain, Arnold Steenhart. That same year, Steenhart gave him as a present to Jacobus van Goch, a trader of the Dutch West India Company.
At the age of 11, in 1728, Capitein was brought to Holland to live with van Goch in The Hague. Van Goch treated him as an adopted son and gave him the last name of Capitein (Dutch for "captain"). Jacobus was placed in school and found to excel in the study of painting, reading and writing, mathematics and the classical languages. Capitein, who was baptized by the Dutch Reformed Church in 1735, let it be known that he wished to return to Africa as a missionary. His adopted father therefore allowed him in 1737 to attend the venerable University of Leiden in order to study theology and become a minister.
Dissertation.
During his time at Leiden, Capitein did not challenge the general attitude towards slavery in the Dutch republic. In his dissertation "De servitude, libertati christianae non contraria" on March 10, 1742, he defended slavery as "niet strydig tegen de christelyke vryheid" ("not in conflict with Christian liberty"). He stressed that a slave who becomes a Christian does not need to be freed, and that slave owners therefore should allow their slaves to be baptized.
It is not clear whether Capitein actually received his doctorate with this dissertation, as he is not listed in the university's archives.
Missionary.
His defense of slavery made him popular with the Dutch East India Company, and he was appointed minister of the fort of Elmina, the hub of the Dutch slave trade along the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana). After a short tour of the Netherlands, where he was celebrated as the "black minister", he left for Elmina. However, his duties as minister and missionary proved difficult. The white slave traders did not like him because he was black and because he did not approve of the slave traders' extramarital affairs. Contact with the other Africans was difficult because Capitein had become too Dutch, and his efforts to baptize the local population proved fruitless. To improve his contact with the Africans, Capitein proposed a marriage with a local girl, but the church did not approve of a marriage to a "heathen" and instead found him a Dutch bride, Antonia Ginderdros, whom he wed in 1745 – the first wedding among the Europeans at Elmina.
Although he had little success as a missionary, Capitein did manage to set up a school and an orphanage at Elmina. His greatest success came in 1744 when Opoku Ware I, king of the Asantes, requested that Capitein educate his children. Capitein tried to send the children to the Netherlands to be educated, but this was not allowed. However, one of the King's sons', Gyakye, was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch republic, carrying a gift of ten elephants' teeth.
Legacy.
Jacobus Capitein's role in history has long been neglected or dismissed as a curiosity because, as a defender of slavery, he was an unlikely role model for black emancipation. However, Capitein's position on slavery should be viewed in the light of his time. Capitein's views fitted in the 18th century climate in which the church had adapted to the slave trade, which had become one of the pillars of the Dutch republic's powerful economy. A rejection of slavery on principle was not considered an option, although some did decry the excesses of the slave trade.
The primary goal of Capitein's thesis was to encourage baptism of Africans by arguing that Africans could be baptized yet remain slaves. Capitein thereby presented a counterargument to Godefridus Cornelisz Udemans, a Dutch minister who had argued that slaves should be freed seven years after they were baptized. This would have effectively rendered baptism a non-option, because slave owners were eager to keep their assets and would therefore not have allowed their slaves to be baptized.

Mount Gabriel

Mount Gabriel () is a mountain on the Mizen Peninsula situated immediately to the north of the town of Schull, in West Cork, Ireland.
Mt. Gabriel is 407m high and is the highest eminence in the coastal zone south and east of Bantry Bay. A roadway serving the radar installations on the summit is open to the public.
From the peak of Mt. Gabriel, there are spectacular views South over Schull Harbour and Long Island Bay. To the east and southeast, the views take in Roaring Water Bay and its many islands, popularly known as Carbery's Hundred Isles. North and West is a panoramic view of the mountains of the Beara Peninsula and South Kerry.
The Fastnet Rock is situated some 18 km to the South, clearly visible in fine weather..
Mining.
All over the southern and eastern slopes of the mountain is evidence of Bronze Age mining activity. The principal ore mined for was Copper. Some of the archaeological items found on the mountain are now found in the National Museum in Dublin.
Radar domes.
In the late 1970s, as part of the development of Eurocontrol (the European air traffic control system), two radar domes were built on the top of the mountain.
1982 the Irish National Liberation Army, an Irish republican paramilitary group blew up the radar domes, claiming that they were being used by NATO in violation of Irish neutrality.

The two Katla languages form a small language family in the Nuba Hills of Sudan. Part of an erstwhile Kordofanian proposal, they are of uncertain position within the Niger–Congo family. They do not share the characteristic morphology of Niger–Congo, such as the noun-class system. Thus Roger Blench classifies them as a divergent branch of Niger–Congo outside the Atlantic–Congo core. A similar situation holds for another Kordofanian family, Rashad; these are not closely related to Katla.

Rashad languages

The Rashad languages form a small language family in the Nuba Hills of Sudan. Part of an erstwhile Kordofanian proposal, they are of uncertain position within the Niger–Congo family. It was at first thought that they shared the characteristic morphology of Niger–Congo, such as the noun-class system. However, only the Tagoi branch has noun classes, and Blench remarks that it appears to have been borrowed. Thus he classifies Rashad as a divergent branch of Niger–Congo outside the Atlantic–Congo core. A similar situation holds for another Kordofanian family, Katla; these are not closely related to Rashad. 
The number of Rashad languages varies among descriptions, from two (Williamson & Blench 2000, reflected in the ISO codes) to seven (Blench "ms," shown here).

Endromis versicolora

The Kentish Glory (Endromis versicolora) is a moth of the family Endromidae. It is found in the Palaearctic region. 
The wingspan is 50–70 mm. The adults fly from March to May.
Females, are much larger and paler than the males, and fly only at night in order to lay eggs. Males, which fly both by night and day, can detect female pheromones from a distance up to 2 km.
Yellow at first, then purplish-brown eggs are laid in 2–3 "rows" around thin branch of birch. After 10–14 days little black caterpillars hatch.
The caterpillars primarily feed on birch ("Betula" sp.), but accepts lots of other trees and shrubs: "Alnus" sp., "Corylus" sp., "Tilia" sp., "Carpinus" sp. It is green with paler stripes, at first feeds in small groups of 15–30 larvae. Mature ones separate and feed only at night individually.
"Endromis versicolora" has a single generation a year; it overwinters as a chrysalis in thin, loose, but strong cocoon buried in the soil at a shallow depth.

Rayleigh Windmill

Rayleigh Windmill is a grade II listed Tower mill at Rayleigh, Essex, England which has been restored as a landmark and is used as a museum.
History.
"Rayleigh Windmill" was built in 1809 for Thomas Higgs, a timber merchant of Rayleigh. Higgs was bankrupt in 1815 and the mill was sold to William Hart of Woodham Mortimer in 1817. Hart sold the mill to George Britton in 1845 and the mill passed to his sons John and Samuel in 1869. £150 was spent putting the mill into repair. The Britton brothers left Rayleigh in 1884 and were bankrupt in 1886. Thomas James Brown was the next miller, and the last to work the mill by wind c1907. The cap and sails were removed c1909 and the mill was worked by a steam engine then an oil engine and latterly by electric motor until at least 1937.
The mill was taken over for use as a museum by Rayleigh and District Antiquarian and Natural History Society, formally opening on 16 May 1970. The capless mill stood for many years with a crenellated top but in 1972 Rayleigh Urban District Council launched an appeal to restore the mill as a landmark. By the autumn of 1974 a new cap and sails had been made and fitted by millwrights John Lawn and Philip Barrett-Lennard.
In 2005, restoration work costing £340,000 was funded by the Thames Gateway South Essex Partnership.
Description.
"Rayleigh Windmill" is a six storey tower mill with a Kentish cap winded by a six bladed fantail. The mill had two single Spring sails and two Common sails carried on a cast iron windshaft. The tower has no batter until second floor level, where the stage is. The tower is diameter at base level and internal diameter at the curb. The brickwork is thick at base level and at curb level it is thickened out to . The mill is high to the top of the cap. The mill drove three pairs of millstones.

Greubel Forsey

Greubel Forsey is a watchmaking company specializing in high-end timepieces. It was launched in 2004 by Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey and is based in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. 
Greubel Forsey specialize in inventing timepieces with multiple tourbillons and inclined balance wheels with the aim of improving timekeeping precision. Their approach was validated in 2011 when a Greubel Forsey Double Tourbillon Technique won the 2011 International Chronometry Competition held by the Le Locle Museum of Horology.
Corporate history.
Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey launched Greubel Forsey in 2004 at BaselWorld with the introduction of their "Double Tourbillon 30° (DT30)". Both men had been working together since 1992 at Renaud & Papi, where they developed complicated watch movements. 
The Richemont group acquired a 20% stake in Greubel Forsey’s share capital in 2006. 
In 2006 the company collaborated with American jeweller Harry Winston to make the "Opus 6" model.
The company has invented and presented a number of tourbillon-based watches including: the "Double Tourbillon 30° (DT30°)", the "Quadruple Tourbillon à Différentiel", the "Tourbillon 24 Secondes Incliné" and the "GMT". At the 2012 SIHH Greubel Forsey presented their first non-tourbillon model, the "Double Balancier 35°".
Timepieces.
Greubel Forsey specializes in designing and manufacturing high-end watches that are usually, but not exclusively, based on the Tourbillon escapement.
Double Tourbillon.
'"
Double Tourbillon 30° (DT30°) Vision/Secret"'
The DT30° was presented in 2004 and features one 30° inclined tourbillon cage rotating once per minute inside another tourbillon cage rotating in four minutes. The company claims rotating one inclined Tourbillon inside another averages out and minimizes gravitationally induced errors on the balance.
Quadruple Tourbillon.
The Quadruple Tourbillon uses two double-tourbillons - four tourbillon cages in total - working independently to average out and minimize gravitationally induced errors on the balance. A spherical differential connects the four rotating carriages, distributing torque between two wheels rotating at different speeds.
The Quadruple Tourbillon Secret, presented in 2012, houses a modified Quadruple Tourbillon ‘hidden’ under a full dial. The movement can be seen through the display back and the two double tourbillon systems – with four tourbillons in all - are configured head-to-tail and are coupled by a spherical differential.
GMT.
Presented in 2011, the GMT is the first Greubel Forsey timepiece to feature a complication other than a tourbillon. It displays second time zone at 10 o’clock and world by a rotating, three-dimensional globe at 8 o’clock. The position of the continents on the titanium globe are cross-referenced with the 24-hour chapter ring circling it for an approximate indication of time all over the world. Other indications include an hour-minute dial at 1 o’clock; a small seconds dial on top of that at 3 o’clock and at 4 o’clock a sectorial power reserve indicator. The movement was especially developed for this timepiece and features the 25° inclined Tourbillon 24 Secondes cage.
Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain.
The Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain, launched in 2012, has royal blue titanium plates and bridges with the movement architecture emphasising the technical aspects of the movement. A 24-second tourbillon is suspended by a transparent synthetic sapphire tourbillon. The T24 Second Contemporain is also notable for its round case, as opposed to the asymmetrical cases that Greubel Forsey are better known for.
Double Balancier 35°.
The Double Balancier 35° features two inclined fixed-oscillators coupled with a spherical differential, which provides the average of their rates to the gear train and time display. Between the two visible inclined balances, small seconds at 7 o’clock displays the running instantaneous average of the two regulators, while a 72-hour power reserve indicator at 2 o’clock keeps track of available power.
Art Piece 1.
Art Piece 1 is a collaboration between Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey with British micro-sculpture Willard Wigan. Art Piece 1 features integrated magnifying optics on the side of the case to enable the Willard Wigan micro sculpture to be viewed.
Invention Pieces.
Invention Pieces are designed to showcase the important invention/mechanism in the movement rather than simply indicating the time.
Invention Piece 1 (IP1) 2007
Invention Piece 1 features the Double Tourbillon 30° mechanism with a new movement architecture. Red and blue triangles indicate the time under a large polished tourbillon bridge, with a small seconds dial and a ‘power reserve indicator’ above.
Invention Piece 2 (IP2) 2011
The Quadruple Tourbillon mechanism is at the heart of Invention Piece 2. The two double tourbillon systems are configured head-to-tail and are coupled by a spherical differential. A sub-dial at 5 o’clock features a red triangle indicating hours while a concentrically-configured rotating disc indicates minutes. Small seconds are at 10 o'clock and there is a power reserve indicator at 11 o'clock.
Invention Piece 3 (IP3) 2009
The Tourbillon 24 Secondes is the mechanism highlighted by Invention Piece 3. A large 24-hour sub-dial dominates the dial side, with hours indicated by a red triangle. A smaller blue triangle indicates minutes. Small seconds are at 5 o’clock. Opposite the tourbillon at 8 o’clock lies a power reserve at 2 o’clock. Four gold dial plates on the dial are engraved with a message in French from Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey.
EWT.
The company presented in 2005 a proprietary development methodology called EWT (Experimental Watch Technology) to experiment, test and ratify their projects in-house. It's a proprietary research and development platform. It incorporates its own laboratory.
Two inventions current in EWT are the ‘"Binomial"’, a mono-material balance-and-spring wheel combination mechanism using isochronically stable materials, and the "Différentiel d’Egalité", a constant force device based in a spherical differential. This differential keeps providing the same constant force to all the four tourbillons, solving the typical problem where the main spring gives different amount of force depending on how much potential energy it retains.
Prizes and awards.
Greubel Forsey won the Gaïa Prize in 2009 for 'Entrepreneurship'; the Grand Prix de l’Aiguille d’Or at the Grand Prix de l’Horlogerie de Genève in 2010 for the Double Tourbillon 30° Édition Historique in 5N red gold; and the International Chronometry Competition in 2011 for the Double Tourbillon 30 Technique. 
Other awards include: Invention Piece 1 won the 2007 Revolution magazine prize for 'Grand Complication Watch'. Montres Passion magazine awarded the 2007 'Special Jury Prize – Watch of the Year' for the Tourbillon 24 Secondes.
Revolution magazine awarded the Quadruple Tourbillon the 2008 prize for best 'Technical Achievement' and in 2009 it also won the prize for best 'Complication Watch' from the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie Asia. The Double Tourbillon 30° Technique received the 2009 'Grand Complication Watch' prize at the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève. Invention Piece 2 was awarded the 2011 prize for “Limited Edition Watch of the Year” at the World Watch Awards in India and at the same ceremony, Stephen Forsey received an award for his “Contribution to Haute Horlogerie”. 
The Invention Piece 2 was later awarded the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève 2012 (GPHG) award for Best Complicated Watch.
Naissance d’une montre.
In 2012, Le Garde Temps, la Naissance d’une Montre (the timepiece, birth of a watch) non-profit initiative was launched by Robert at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) in Geneva.
“Le garde-temps, naissance d’une montre” is a project by Robert Greubel, Stephen Forsey and independent watchmaker Philippe Dufour. The aim of the project is to preserve and propagate traditional horological knowledge and experience by teaching and helping master watchmaker and watchmaking teacher, Michel Boulanger, to make a small series of timepieces by hand using traditional techniques and methods.
Founders.
Robert Greubel grew up in Alsace, France and began his horological career by working with his watchmaker father in the family shop, Greubel Horlogerie. In 1987 Greubel moved to Switzerland to join the International Watch Company (IWC), where he helped develop their Grand Complication. In 1990 he joined Renaud & Papi SA (now Audemars Piguet Renaud & Papi SA) as a prototypist for complicated movements and rose to become managing director and partner. 
Stephen Forsey grew up in St Albans, England, where he was inspired by his father's passion for mechanics and engineering. From 1987 to 1992 Forsey specialized in antique clock restoration and became head of Watch Restoration at Asprey’s in London. From 1988 to 1990 Forsey attended two five-month courses at the WOSTEP watchmaking school in Neuchâtel and in 1992 joined Robert Greubel's team at Renaud & Papi SA (now Audemars Piguet Renaud & Papi SA), developing complicated watch movements.
In 1999 both Greubel and Forsey began working independently, and in 2001 they founded together Complitime SA, a company specializing in created mechanisms with complicated movements for up-market watch brands.
At the world watch fair at BaselWorld in 2004, after many years in development, Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey launched their first watch, the Double Tourbillion 30° (DT30°), under their own brand ‘Greubel Forsey’.
Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey are founding members of the Time aeon Foundation

Gustav A. Hedlund

Gustav Arnold Hedlund (1904–1993), an American mathematician, was one of the founders of symbolic and topological dynamics.
Biography.
Hedlund was born May 7, 1904, in Somerville, Massachusetts. He did his undergraduate studies at Harvard University, earned a masters degree from Columbia University, and returned to Harvard for his doctoral studies. He was a student of Marston Morse, under whose supervision he received a Ph.D. in 1930 with thesis entitled "I. Geodesics on a Two-Dimensional Riemannian Manifold with Periodic Coefficients II. Poincare's Rotation Number and Morse's Type Number".
While still studying at Columbia, Hedlund taught at Hunter College, and after receiving his doctorate he took a position at Bryn Mawr College, where he remained for nine years. From 1939 to 1948 he taught at the University of Virginia, after which he moved to Yale University. At Yale, he became the Philip Schuyler Beebe Professor of Mathematics, and chaired the mathematics department for ten years. He was also a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, which he visited in 1933, 1938, and 1953. He retired from Yale in 1972, but afterwards held a visiting professorship at Wesleyan University.
Hedlund died in 1993. He has over 200 academic descendants, many of them through two of his students at Virginia, Walter Gottschalk and W. Roy Utz, Jr.
Research.
One of Hedlund's early results was an important theorem about the ergodicity of geodesic flows. He also made significant contributions to symbolic dynamics, whose origins as a field of modern mathematics can be traced to a 1944 paper of Hedlund, and to topological dynamics.
The Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata, is named after Hedlund. Hedlund first published this theorem in 1969, crediting Morton L. Curtis and Roger Lyndon as co-discoverers.
Hedlund was the co-author of the book "Topological Dynamics" (with Walter Gottschalk, American Mathematical Society, 1955).
Awards and honors.
Hedlund was elected to Sigma Xi in 1943.
In 1972, a conference on topological dynamics was held to honor Hedlund on the occasion of his retirement from Yale. The editor of the festschrift from the conference, Anatole Beck, wrote that it was "our token of respect to the man who did so much to foster and build this field".

Foundation.
Tila was founded in 1564 by Fray Pedro Lorenzo de la Nada. In 1677 was a parish, and the documents of that time express the abuses of a Catholic priest, Father Cuevas, "a man with racist frustrations" who physically punished the indigenous inhabitants. In 1712 there was organized in Tila an uprising against the Spanish Authorities because of tax policies. In July 1829 the governor Emeterio Pineda granted Tila the category of "Villa". The postal service was founded in 1833. In 1920 there were made formalities that lasted for 10 years in Mexico and in Tuxtla Gutierrez to create in Tila the category of "ejidos" or communal land. In 1930 Tila became an Ejido of Chiapas. Since then on there coexists in Tila two main authorities, represented by the Commissioner Ejidal and by the municipal president. In the year 2005 there was a conflict by representatives of both authorities that divided the Tila between "ejiditarios" (indigenous owners of communal lands) and "pobladores" (new mestizo people who bought plots of land from former indigenous owners).

Ogosta Reservoir

Ogosta () is a lake in the North West of Bulgaria. It is the second largest artificial lake in Bulgaria and The Balkan Peninsula and one of the biggest in Europe. 
It collects the waters of the rivers Ogosta, Burzia and Zlatitsa and is located about 600 meters to the south-west of the border of Montana city and 60 m. above the level of the city. The water collecting basin is with area of 948 km2 and the area of the lake itself is 24 hectares. The average water volume is 384 Mm3 and the overall volume 506Mm3.
The construction of the lake took 20 years and was completed in 1986. For its construction two villages were flooded (Jivovtsi and Kalimanitsa) and their inhabitants relocated to Berkovitsa and Montana.
This hydro-technical outfit was erected for the purpose of irrigation of large areas of agricultural land situated from Montana to Zlatia (near Lom), but until 1989 only half of the pipe infrastructure was developed and it was never completed. 
Nowadays the waters of the lake are not used for irrigation, but for electricity production in two hydro-electric power-stations: “Kosharnik” and “Ogosta” situated by the dam. 
In 1999 the lake was designated for commercial fishing. The diversity of fish is significant: carp, carassius, rudd, carp bream, European perch, common nase and barbus.

James Brown House (Manhattan)

The James Brown House is a historic building in the Hudson Square neighborhood of New York City. It was built in the early 19th century. Today, it is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a City Landmark. It is one of the few existing examples of Federal architecture in New York. Its ground level is the site of The Ear Inn, one of the oldest existing taverns in New York City.
History.
The two-and-a-half-story Flemish brick house which features a gambrel roof and dormers was built in 1817 and was originally the home of James Brown, an African-American Revolutionary War veteran, who was the proprietor of a tobacco store on the ground floor of the house. At the time of the building's construction, the house was only several feet from the shoreline of the Hudson River, although subsequent urban development has since filled in land that has increased the distance to the shore.
Brown sold the building to two apothecaries in the mid-19th century, and records show that a tavern occupied the shop from at least 1835; it was likely a bar even earlier than that, making it one of the oldest taverns in New York City. The house was purchased in 1890 by an Irish immigrant named Thomas Cloke, who ran a tavern and sold beer and spirits to sailors and longshoremen. The tavern had a brewery that was later turned into a restaurant. Cloke was reported to be a successful businessman and was well regarded in the community. 
Cloke sold the business in 1919 in anticipation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibited the sale of alcohol. During Prohibition, the restaurant became a speakeasy, while the upstairs floors were variously a boarding house, a headquarters for smugglers, and a brothel.
After Prohibition, the bar re-opened, but now existed as a business without a name. It was simply called "The Green Door", and catered to a clientele of waterfront workers, almost all of whom were hard-drinking regulars. The area declined sharply during the mid-20th century, as urban decay turned the once-bustling area into a nearly abandoned district.
In 1969, the building was one of the earliest designations of the city's Landmarks Commission.
In the mid 1970s, a group of struggling artists purchased the building, and in 1977, they re-opened the bar. Due to restrictions on changing signage on historic buildings, however, the new proprietors simply painted out part of the letter B in the "Bar" sign, turning it into the word "Ear", after "The Ear", a music magazine they published upstairs.
Today.
Today, the James Brown House remains largely unchanged from its past appearance, even as urban renewal has transformed the area around it. Indeed, as part of the permitting process, real-estate developers have paid for thousands of dollars in repairs and improvements to the building, including a backyard fire escape The Ear Inn still exists as a bar and restaurant, featuring memorabilia from its past.

Audio &amp; Design (Recording) Ltd

Audio & Design (Recording) Ltd are an English based company who specialised in the development and production of professional audio processors, in the form of limiters, compressors, expanders & equalisers. The company were one of the first to introduce Field-effect transistors into a commercially available limiter amplifier in 1966. Audio & Design (Recording) equipment has been widely used by professional studios, music artists and the broadcasting industry throughout the world. Recently the company has installed and serviced the BBC World Service's multi Terabyte archive installation using Storage area network technology (SAN).
Notable Products.
F760X-RS 'Compex' Limiter.
The F760X 'Compex' limiter was made up of three main parts; a compressor, limiter and a 'noise reducing' expander/gate. All of these parts could be used separately or together for well controlled sound limiting. This combination came about from client feedback. From the feedback ADR designed and built the first units, these were labelled as F760X-RS (RS meaning rackmount stereo). Later modifications were made and another version was released with a better, ergonomically designed, front panel. This later model was labelled as the 'Compex'.
The 'Compex' limiter provided peak limiting with a multi-ratio, variable threshold compressor. Ratio settings ranged from 1:1 to 20:1 and there were controls for threshold and release time. The inclusion of an expander/gate provided attenuation of the gain during pauses in the audio signal to reduce noise caused by compression; the expander/gate could also be used for special 'punchy' effects, favoured on drum and percussive sounds. Noise gates were often criticised at the time for 'hunting' around the threshold point. The 'Compex' used clever hysteresis around the gate, this was important to stop unpredictable opening and closing of the gate; the open threshold was higher than the close threshold.
The gain reduction controlled by the 'Compex' was monitored from two meters located to the right of the front panel. There were two light indicators; a red light lit when the signal level reached its peak, and when in expand mode a green light was lit. There were a set of lights for each channel, depending if the unit was the stereo or mono version.
There were some different models of the 'Compex' available; one of these included a smaller console module named the F760-N. This version was built without the expander/gate, it later had an expander/gate added and was then known as the F760X-N. 
There is also a rare version called F760X-RS/T. One of the visible differences are the VU-meters, which got the brand"Audio & Design Recording LTD." and if you look on the rear, there you can see the type.
The "T" stands for transformer, which are said to add harmonics to the sound.The "T" version was mainly used in broadcasting stations, mainly because of its SNR and headroom. ADR also built an F760 version for the Helios mixing consoles.
Scamp Rack.
Scamp stood for (Standardised Compatible Audio Modular Package). The system embodied the card-module concept within a standard racking frame. Although employing no specifically new techniques the design offered dramatic savings in packaging costs without degradation in performance standard. The rack was designed to be configured to different types of recording sessions using different types of modules. The rack could hold seventeen one inch modules all powered from the rack itself by use of an external power supply. A half-width rack with integrated power supply which could hold six modules was also available.
Below is a list of the modules that were available.

Movin' (album)

Movin' is the second album by American singer Jennifer Rush.
Overview.
Originally released in Germany in late 1985, just as Rush was experiencing worldwide success with "The Power of Love" from her previous album, "Movin"' became an instant hit there. The album reached No.1 for 14 weeks and went on to be the biggest selling album of 1986. Despite high sales for her previous album, Rush found it harder to follow up in the UK, where the album (released in 1986) only managed to reach No.32, mainly due to the lack of a hit single. The international first release was "Destiny", which charted highly in many countries, but only scraped the bottom of the top 100 in the UK. A second single "If You're Ever Gonna Lose My Love" also sold well in Europe. Other notable tracks included a decidedly electronic working of the Stevie Wonder song "Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday", and "Ave Maria" (an original track), which was released as a single much later in 1991.
US success still eluded Rush and so after this album she decided to relocate from Germany in order to secure a wider fanbase for her next album.
In some countries the Jennifer Rush debut album was a cross section of tracks from "Jennifer Rush" (1984) and "Movin' ", either titled "Jennifer Rush" (Canada, German Democratic Republic) or "Movin (Venezuela).

Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort

The Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort is a historic fort and temple complex built on an ancient rock. It is located in the city of Tiruchirapalli, which is in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is constructed on a 273-foot high rock. There are two Hindu temples inside the "Rockfort", the Uchchi Pillaiyar Koil and the Siva Temple. Geologically the 83 m high rock may date to over one billion years ago. Other local tourist attractions include the famous Pallava-era Ganesa temple and the Nayaka-era fort. The fort complex has witnessed fierce battles between Madurai Nayakas and Bijapur, Carnatic and Maratha forces. The fort played an important part during the Carnatic wars, helping lay the foundations of the British Empire in India.
History.
The name Rockfort comes from the fact that the place was used for military fortification, first by the Vijayanagar emperors and later by the British during the Carnatic wars. The oldest structure in the fort is a cave temple built by Pallavas in 580 AD. During the Cholas period, the nearby town of Woraiyur was their capital, but the Pallavas did not keep control of this strategic city and lost it to the Pandyas. The Cholas reasserted themselves in the 10th century. Trichy continued to be in their possession until the decline of the empire, after which it became a Vijayanagara stronghold.
In mid 14th century, the region was under the Delhi Sultanate, after Malik Kafur's raid on South India. They were ousted and the region came under the control of Vijayanagara Empire. During the early part of 16th century, the region came under the control of Madurai Nayaks, who were the earlier governors of Vijayanagara Empire. However, it was under the Nayaks of Madurai that Trichy prospered in its own right and grew to be the city that it is today. The Nayaks of Madurai constructed the Rock Fort Temple Lake along with major walls as foundations, establishing the town as a trading city and later, their capital.
The fort palace also witnessed the transfer of power from Queen Meenakshi to Chanda Sahib, as he ruled in conjunction with the French alliance. He lost this command when his uncle, the Nawab of Arcot along with the British, seized the fort after the Carnatic wars. This enabled the British to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu and later South India.
The fort, in modern times, is maintained and administered by the Chennai Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India. The fort is one of the prominent tourist destinations in Tamil Nadu.
Major Battles.
Nayak era.
As the Fort was the capital of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty, the fort has witnessed fierce battles. One of the largest was the Battle of Toppur for supremacy between the Aravidu Dynasty of Vijayanagara Emperor and the Madurai Nayaks. The former won, with support from the Mysore and Tanjore rulers in 16th century. Later, the Nayaks faced fierce attacks from Bijapur, Mysore and Marathas troops. The Fort complex formed the northwest territory to the Nayaks. During their two-century rule, they had occasional skirmishes with their neighbours, the Tanjore Nayaks, the Tanjore Marathas, and more often with the invading Bijapur, Mysore and Maratha armies.
Carnatic Nawab Era.
During the mid century, Chanda Sahib, aided by the French, made this fort his home base. He battled with the combined forces of the Carnatic Nawab and British. He was defeated in the Carnatic wars and was forced to cede his lands to the British.
British Era.
In the late 18th century, Hyder Ali was a major threat to the British, as were the French who were still fighting for their colonial supremacy in this region. By now, the town was firmly established as a Cantonment town and the fort's gate was known as main guard gate.Robert Clive lived near the tank when he was in Tiruchirappalli.
Architecture.
The rock is said to be one of the oldest formations in the world. It is 3.8 billion years old, making it as old as the rocks in Greenland and older than the Himalayas. Quartz, used in glass making, and feldspar, used in ceramics, are found in this rock formation.
As the name suggests, the Rock Fort Temple is situated on 83 metre-high outcrops. The Pallavas initially built this temple, but the Nayaks made use of its naturally fortified position and designed it again. It is a long climb up the 344 steps cut into the stone to the top.
The temple complex in the fort complex is a collection of three temples:
Rock-Cut Temple.
There are two rock cut temples in the fort, one in the lower part of the fort called Lower Cave temple and other in the complex outside the Thayumanswamny on the way up to Uchi Pillayar Kovil, called the Upper Cave temple. An archaeological study in 2010 revealed that the layout of the rock-cut caves in the temple is similar to that of other rock-cut temples such as the Pundarikakshan Perumal Temple at Thiruvellarai and Pechipalai cave temple. The unfinished caves in the temple, along with the lower cave temples in Thiruvellarari and Tiruparankunram, each have a shrine for Shiva in the east and Vishnu in the west, separated by a central bay between them. The study also revealed that the Lower Cave temple along with Kudumiyan Malai temple exhibited unique form of pillars, which are otherwise not seen in other temples in Tamil Nadu.
The rock-cut temple in the hill temple complex was built during the Pallava era and is named Lalitankura Pallaveswaram, with several inscriptions attributed to Mahendravarman I. The Cholas, the Vijayanagar rulers and the Nayaks of Madurai have made extensive contributions here. The two-storey-tall Taayumaanava temples are considered to be a masterpiece of construction.

It was in 1984 however that she found her first success with the hit "25 Lovers". This was followed by "Ring of Ice" and then with the song she would become famous the world over for - "The Power of Love". In 1985 the song became a massive success and reached No.1 in the UK for five weeks, selling well over a million copies.

TP-003

TP-003 is an anxiolytic drug with a novel chemical structure, which is used in scientific research. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. It is a subtype-selective partial agonist at GABAA receptors, binding to GABAA receptor complexes bearing either α2, α3 or α5 subunits, but only showing significant efficacy at α3. It has modest anticonvulsant activity although less than that of diazepam, and its main effect is likely to be selective anxiolytic action, as seen with other related α3-preferring agonists such as L-838,417.

Nathalie Gassel (born 19 June 1964) is a Belgian writer and photographer. Born in Brussels, she is also known as a Muay Thai sportsperson. She contributed to the 1999 work entitled "Picturing the Modern Amazon", which was translated by Pierre Samuel and published by New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City. She has made a number of public appearances through the years and her writings have been published by the University of Brussels Review. Nathalie Gassel's writing exposes her life as an athlete and details her muscular physique and is expressed in "Eros Androgyne" and "Musculatures". These two works celebrate the wonders of her strong body and the power she wields in this flesh of steel. Her recent and decisive writing in "The Years of Insignificance" probes the adversities of her torn and troubled childhood and continues to affirm her strength and radical persona. Gassel's photographic publication "Récit Plastique" confirms this singular and compelling universe through the eyes of a camera lens.
"In a readily traditional prose with quasi-nervous tension that vibrates constantly building intensity," describes the philosopher Frank Pierobon, ""Récit Plastique" recounts this through dialogue texts and photographs. This body with body, between writings and images, oscillates between instincts of life and death, leading to a marbled reflection of abstractions."

History.
The Fasl-ı Cedid was established by Santuri Hilmi Bey, a well-regarded musician in the Ottoman Imperial Court, with the endorsement of Sultan Mahmud II, as part of the reforms taking place in the Empire to westernize all government functions and institutions, including those relating to state-sponsored musical education.
Structure.
The ensemble was typically made up of neys, flutes, and mandolins, variously complemented by violins, violoncellos, lutes, guitars, trombones and castanets. More traditional saz elements such as ouds, neys, kanuns and zills generally accompanied these instruments.
The compositions performed featured makams closer to the melodic structures, keys and chords as defined by a western understanding of scale, i.e. major and minor, and generally were of peşrev, saz semâ'î, canzone, köçekçe and oyun havası performances.

Scythropia crataegella

__NOTOC__
The Hawthorn Moth (Scythropia crataegella) is a species of ermine moth (family Yponomeutidae) from western Eurasia. It is usually placed in a small subfamily Scythropiinae, which is sometimes included in the Yponomeutinae.
Described as "Phalaena crataegella" by Linnaeus in 1767, it was made the type species of "Scythropia", the only Scythropiinae genus currently recognized, by Jacob Hübner in the 1820s. Initially (in 1796), Hübner had misidentified the grass moth "Eudonia lacustrata" – much larger and only distantly related, but somewhat similar in color and pattern – as Linnaeus' "Phalaena crataegella". Similarly, a junior synonym of this species, "Tinea cornella", has frequently been misapplied – and sometimes still is even today – to the fairly closely related Apple Blossom Tineid ("Argyresthia curvella").
Description and ecology.
"S. crataegella" is a small moth is widespread almost all over Europe; it is absent from Great Britain north of Yorkshire, and has also not been recorded yet on Iceland and Ireland (where it is probably genuinely absent), in Portugal (where it may be absent), and in Slovenia (where it probably occurs but has not been found yet, as its range includes the surrounding countries). It is quite common throughout its range. The nocturnal adults are attracted to light sources; on Great Britain they are only commonly seen in July, but elsewhere they may be found from late May to September and have two generations per year.
The wingspan of adults is 11–15 mm. As usual for Yponomeutidae, the forewings have a bold black-and-white pattern: two thick but irregular black bands divide the white forewings into roughly equal inner, middle and outer parts, and the white between the bands has numerous small black spots. The hindwings are dusky greyish-brown and unadorned. The body is whitish. The caterpillar larvae feed in large groups from the safety of a silken web they produce together; young larvae are leaf miners. The mainstay food is leaves of "Crataegus" (hawthorn), hence the species' name. But they have also been recorded from other Amygdaloideae, e.g. Blackthorn ("Prunus spinosa") and other "Prunus" species, "Cotoneaster", as well as "Malus sylvestris" and "Pyrus" (pear).

Peugeot Sport

Peugeot Sport is the department of French carmaker Peugeot responsible for motorsport activities.
History.
Beginnings in rallying.
Peugeot Sport was formed in 1981 under the name of Peugeot Talbot Sport, after Jean Todt, a World Rally Championship co-driver for Talbot driver Guy Fréquelin, was asked by Peugeot to create a sporting department for the PSA Peugeot Citroën group. The rally team, established at Bois de Boulogne near Paris, debuted its Group B Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 in 1984, and took its first victory in Finland in the hands of Ari Vatanen. In 1985, Peugeot drivers Vatanen and Timo Salonen won seven out of the 12 rounds to give Peugeot the manufacturers' title and Salonen the drivers' title. Vatanen had been seriously injured in an accident in Argentina in 1985, so was replaced by Juha Kankkunen for 1986, who promptly delivered the team a second consecutive title. The FIA banned Group B cars for the 1987 season after the fatal accident of Henri Toivonen. This lead Peugeot to switch to rally raid, using the 205 to win the Dakar Rally for three consecutive years from 1987 to 1989, and then used the 405 to win in 1990. Peugeot Talbot Sport also participated three times at the Pike's Peak Hillclimb Race in 1987, 1988 and 1989, winning the last two years.
Move to sportscars.
In endurance racing Peugeot Talbot Sport established their sportscar team at Vélizy-Villacoublay, France and in 1988 launched the 905 project, to develop a sportscar to begin competing in the World Sportscar Championship in the 1991 season. The 905 was introduced in 1990, and finished second in the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season. In 1992, Peugeot Talbot Sport won the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with drivers Derek Warwick, Yannick Dalmas and Mark Blundell. They also won the World Sportscar Championship, thanks to Warwick, Dalmas, Philippe Alliot and Mauro Baldi. The championship did not run in 1993, but Peugeot were able to take a 1-2-3 finish at the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Eric Hélary, Christophe Bouchut and Geoff Brabham driving the winning car. Peugeot Talbot Sport subsequently pulled out of sportscar racing. Jean Todt, meanwhile, left Peugeot for Scuderia Ferrari.
Formula One.
Peugeot switched to Formula One for , using the same 3.5L V10 engine used in the 905. This was easily adapted to be used by McLaren in 1994. However, poor results led to the relationship ending at the end of 1994. This led to Peugeot supplying Jordan Grand Prix in and and , before supplying the new Prost Grand Prix team for the , and seasons. The Peugeot engines were bought by Asiatech at the end of 2000 and used for two further years.
Return to rallying.
In 1999, Peugeot Sport returned to the World Rally Championship with the Peugeot 206 WRC, under the guidance of director Corrado Provera. The car debuted at the Tour de Corse, with François Delecour driving one car and Gilles Panizzi and Marcus Grönholm sharing the second car over the remaining events. Grönholm finished fourth on the car’s third event, Rally Finland, before Panizzi finished second on Rallye Sanremo.
In 2000, Grönholm gave the car its first victory at Rally Sweden, and followed this up with wins in New Zealand, Finland and Australia on his way to the Drivers’ championship. Panizzi won in Corsica and Sanremo, giving Peugeot the Manufacturers’ championship.
In 2001, Didier Auriol joined the team, replacing Delecour as the main driver alongside Grönholm. Panizzi and Harri Rovanperä also drove additional cars for the team on selected events. Rovanperä won round two in Sweden, as Grönholm struggled with retirements during the first half of the year. Auriol won in Spain, Grönholm won in Finland, Australia and Great Britain, and Panizzi won in Italy. The team retained their manufacturers’ crown, even though Grönholm was the best placed driver in the drivers’ standings, in fourth place. Rovanperä was fifth, Auriol eighth and Panizzi ninth.
For 2002, the team signed Richard Burns, the 2001 champion, from Subaru, replacing Auriol in the team. Grönholm won round two in Sweden, before Panizzi took back-to-back wins in France and Spain. Grönholm won the next event in Cyprus, before he and Burns were disqualified for a technical infringement in Argentina. Grönholm won again in Finland, while Panizzi won his third event of the year in Italy. Grönholm completed back-to-back victories in New Zealand and Australia to take his second drivers’ title. Burns finished the season fifth, ahead of Panizzi and Rovanperä in sixth and seventh. Peugeot were able to take a third consecutive Manufacturers’ title.
The driver lineup remained the same for 2003, with Marlboro joining as title sponsor. Grönholm won in Sweden yet again, and took another two wins in New Zealand and Argentina. Panizzi picked up another win in Spain. Poised to rejoin Subaru in 2004, Burns was ruled out of action ahead of the final round of the season in Great Britain, having suffered a blackout while driving to the event. He was replaced for the event and the 2004 season by Belgian Freddy Loix. Burns finished the season fourth in the standings, ahead of Grönholm in sixth. Peugeot lost its manufacturers crown to Citroën.
Peugeot introduced a new car for the 2004 season, the 307 WRC, which was based upon the coupé cabriolets version of the 307 road car. Having originally not been part of the team at the start of the season, Rovanperä replaced Loix after two rounds in the team’s second car alongside Grönholm, who struggled with the new car initially. He took the team’s only victory of the season in Finland, and he finished fifth in the standings at the end of the season. Peugeot finished fourth in the manufacturers’ standings.
For 2005, Peugeot signed Markko Märtin from Ford to partner Grönholm. Once again, it took until Grönholm won Rally Finland yet again in August for the team to win. Two rallies later, in Great Britain, Märtin’s co-driver Michael Park was killed after the pair’s 307 WRC left the road. Märtin subsequently pulled out of the World Rally Championship. Daniel Carlsson and Nicolas Bernardi both filled in for him during the final four events. Grönholm took a second win of the season in Japan, on his way to third in the standings. Peugeot finished second in the manufacturers’ standings. At the end of 2005, PSA Peugeot Citroën withdrew its two teams from the WRC. Citroën took a year out to develop a new car and returned in 2007, but Peugeot did not return to the WRC.
Peugeot Sport created the Peugeot 207 S2000, a rally car built to Super 2000 regulations. Peugeot Sport enter the cars, run by Kronos Racing, in the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC). Peugeot drivers Enrique García-Ojeda, Nicolas Vouilloz and Kris Meeke won the IRC drivers' title in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively.
Return to sportscars.
Under the guidance of new director Michel Barge, Peugeot Sport returned to sportscar racing for 2007, taking on the dominant Audi with the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP. The car made its debut at the 2007 1000km of Monza, the opening round of the 2007 Le Mans Series season. The pairing of Marc Gené and Nicolas Minassian took the car to victory. At the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, Stéphane Sarrazin took pole position for the team ahead of the Audis. In the race, the #8 car of Sarrazin, Pedro Lamy and Sébastien Bourdais finished second behind the #1 Audi. After Le Mans, Sarrazin and Lamy took the Le Mans Series title for Peugeot.
At the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans, Peugeot and Sarrazin once again took pole position, locking out the first three places on the grid. In the race, the trio of cars finished in second, third and fifth. In the Le Mans Series, Peugeot lost out to Audi again, Minassian and Gené finishing in second place.
At the beginning of 2009, PSA Peugeot Citroën made Citroën Sport director Olivier Quesnel the director of Peugeot Sport too. At the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, Sarrazin set his third consecutive pole position for the team. In the race, the team delivered its first Le Mans victory since 1993, with the trio of David Brabham, Gené and Alexander Wurz winning ahead of the car driven by Franck Montagny, Bourdais and Sarrazin. The team’s third car finished the race in sixth position. The team only contested one round of the Le Mans Series season, at Spa as preparation for Le Mans itself.
Peugeot scored a 1-2 finish at the 2010 12 Hours of Sebring. However, reliability problems for the 908 at the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans meant that Audi finished 1-2-3 at the race.
At the 2011 12 Hours of Sebring, the older Peugeot 908 HDi FAP owned by Oreca Racing had a surprise win over the factory 908s and Audi R15++s. At the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans, Peugeot saw itself in a position to win after two of the Audi R18s crashed; only a strong effort from Audi kept Peugeot from winning the race. The winning Audi was only 13 seconds ahead of the 2nd-place Peugeot 908.
On January 18, 2012, Peugeot Sport announced its withdrawal from sportscar racing, citing lowering car sales and the economic downturn as reasons. A return, however, was not ruled out if funds can be procured for the future, but not likely before 2015.
Return to Pike's Peak Hillclimb Race.
After Ari Vatanen and Bobby Unser, in the late 1980s, won the Pike's Peak Hillclimb Race, Peugeot Sport and Sebastien Loeb decided to unite their respective strengths and go for it.
In April 2013, a 208 T16 was tested by Sébastien Loeb at Mont Ventoux. Loosely based on the shape and design of the production 208, the T16 is a lightweight vehicle that uses the rear wing from the Peugeot 908, and has a 3.2-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine, developing with the aim of competing at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. June 30, 2013 saw this car demolish the standing record on Pikes Peak by over a minute and a half, with an overall time of 8:13.878.

Park End Street

Park End Street is a street in central Oxford, England, to the west of the centre of the city, close to the railway station at its western end.
Location.
To the east, New Road links Park End Street to central Oxford. To the west, Frideswide Square links Park End Street with Botley Road, the main arterial road in and out of Oxford to and from the west. Parallel to the street to the north is Hythe Bridge Street. At the junction with New Road, Worcester Street leads north and Tidmarsh Lane leads south. At the junction with Frideswide Square, Rewley Road leads north and Hollybush Row leads south.
History.
Park End Street was built in 1769–70 as part of New Road, a new turnpike road between central Oxford and the west. It bypassed the earlier and narrower Hythe Bridge Street to the north and St. Thomas's High Street (now St Thomas' Street) to the south. Pacey's Bridge was built to carry the eastern part of Park End Street across Castle Mill Stream, which is part of the River Thames.
The street's name is derived from a wharf where coal from Parkend in the Forest of Dean was delivered by barge. From the 1840s, railways took an increasing share of coal traffic. Inland waterways' share of the traffic declined and in 1885 Park End Wharf was redeveloped for other purposes (see below).
Public house.
By the early part of the 19th century, a public house had been opened at 1 Park End Street on the north side of the street just east of the bridge. It was named the Queen's Arms, almost certainly after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen Consort of George III. The pub is currently called the Duke's Cut.
Breweries.
In 1885 Park End Wharf was redeveloped as the site of the Tower Brewery, which its owner F. Phillips then expanded in the 1890s and 1900s to designs by local architect H.J. Tollit.
Before the Tower Brewery was built, the Eagle Brewery was already on a site next to the wharf. Its owner William Miller renamed it the Eagle Steam Brewery to advertise its conversion to steam powered brewing, and then in 1869 sold it to J.N. Weaving. In 1871 Weaving demolished part of the brewery to build a granary and in 1872 he added a three-storey malthouse. Weaving's successor F. Phillips continued to expand the business, including the addition of a new tower brewhouse, chimney and other buildings in 1885 designed by H.J. Tollit. No buildings of either the Eagle or the Tower breweries now survive.
Railway station.
From 1851 Oxford Rewley Road railway station was on the corner of Park End Street and Rewley Road. British Railways closed the station in 1951 and its goods yard in 1984. The station was dismantled and moved to Buckinghamshire Railway Centre in 1999 to make way for the creation of Frideswide Square and building of Saïd Business School.
Warehouse.
Archer, Cowley & Co's Cantay Depositories furniture warehouse was designed by Tollit and built in 1901. Behind its decorative gabled red brick facade, Cantay Depositories has a steel frame and iron columns cast by William Lucy's Eagle Ironworks in Jericho, Oxford. As a warehouse the building had of storage space and was segregated into sections by armoured, fire-proof doors that would close automatically in the event of fire. Cantay House is now Oxford Conference Centre, a nightclub, and a retail store.
Marmalade factory.
From 1903 until after the Second World War Frank Cooper's Oxford Marmalade was made at a factory at 27 Park End Street (now part of Frideswide Square) next to Victoria Buildings. The former factory is now a listed building. It is now called "The Jam Factory" and houses an arts centre, restaurant, and bar. "The Jam Factory" also houses Guardian Award winning charity, "My Life My Choice" run by and for people with learning disabilities.
Motor trade.
From the end of the First World War a number of car and motorcycle traders had premises in Park End Street. They included King's Motors and Hartwell's, both of which were founded in Oxford in 1919, and R.K. Leighton, which was taken over by King's but remained a separate subsidiary. By 1930 Basil King had premises in Park End Street with showroom space for 100 motorcycles. In 1934 King's had larger premises built at 15 Park End Street with showroom space for 500 motorcycles. The 1934 showroom is a two-storey Art Deco building whose facade is of yellow Bath Stone ashlar to match the Royal Oxford Hotel next door. H.F. Temple was another motorcycle dealer in the 1940s/50s; their premises were situated at 46 Park End Street and also 69 High Street, St Thomas, Oxford. Temples was the main Oxford supplier for the BSA C11G and C12 and is listed in the 1956 BSA C12 Owners handbook as being the only BSA dealer in the city*. (*"Source from the 1956 BSA C12 Owners handbook, listing all addresses/suppliers in the UK at this time"). 
All but one of the motor traders have now moved to premises further from central Oxford. Hartwell's former premises are now a branch of Staples Inc. Only King's former premises remain in the motor trade: it is now a branch of Kwik-Fit.

The Town Crieris a group of Toronto-based community newspapers now published by Multimedia Nova Corporation[http://www.multimedianova.com/.
The newspapers are distributed in seven editions to nine communities throughout the city of Toronto. Started in 1979 by Harry Goldhar, a "Toronto Star" journalist, the "Town Crier" group has changed owners and titles over the years.
Dan Iannuzzi was the owner of the "Town Crier" from 2001 until his death in November 2004. Iannuzzi’s company bought the "Town Crier" newspapers in 2001 from Beaches resident Julie Morris, who had previously acquired them from Leaside residents Harry and Ruth Goldhar who had founded the papers with an East York-based edition in 1978. By the time of Iannuzzi's death the papers had expanded to nine editions that covered an area of over 287,000 homes and nearly a million residents in Toronto.
"Town Crier" published nine editions serving the Toronto neighbourhoods of Bayview Mills, Beach-South Riverdale, Riverdale-East York, Bloor West, Forest Hill, Leaside-Rosedale, North Toronto, North York and MidTown. A downtown edition, "Toronto Today" was also published.
The "Town Crier" website gave two different start dates for the newspaper in separate articles: 1978 and 1979.
The chain indefinitely suspended publication in May 2013, along with sister paper "Corriere Canadese" and "Vaughan Today" after parent company Multimedia Nova went into receivership.

Birkdale High School is an all-boys secondary school with academy status situated in Southport in North West England. Located close to neighbouring schools Christ the King and Greenbank High School (the equivalent girls' school), Birkdale was originally a co-educational school known as Birkdale Secondary Modern School. The school lacks a sixth form and only takes boys from ages 11–16. The uniform consists of a blue blazer, black trousers, a shirt and a tie. A navy blue jumper is also optional. The school also has good public transport links, located near Hillside Rail Station.
Ofsted.
Birkdale enjoyed a sustained period of positive Ofsted Reports, receiving 'Good with Outstanding Features' in 2005. The school led the league table in the Southport area for the highest number of A*-C Grades, but has since been overtaken by local mixed school Christ the King and Girls' School Greenbank. In 2011 however, the school failed its inspection and was placed into 'Special Measures' by the regulatory body. Ofsted returned in the coming months to find that progress had been made, but that there were still areas of wholly inadequate practice in the school.

1952 Severo-Kurilsk tsunami

1952 Severo-Kurilsk Tsunami was a major tsunami that hit Severo-Kurilsk, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Oblast, Russian SFSR, USSR, which occurred on 5 November 1952 at about 5 a.m. It led to the destruction of many settlements in Sakhalin Oblast and Kamchatka Oblast, while the main impact struck the town of Severo-Kurilsk.
The tsunami was generated by a major earthquake in the Pacific Ocean, from the shore of Kamchatka, with an estimated magnitude of 9.0. There were three waves about high. After the earthquake the majority of the Severo-Kurilsk citizens fled to the surrounding hills, where they escaped the first wave. However, most of them returned to the town and were killed by the second wave. The third wave was minor. According to the authorities, out of a population of 6,000 people, 2,336 died. The remaining survivors were evacuated to continental Russia. The settlement was then rebuilt in another location.

Phytoserm

PhytoSERM ("phyto" = plant, "SERM" = selective estrogen receptor modulator) are botanically derived substances that possess SERM qualities, similar to synthetically manufactured drugs of the same category.
Mechanism of action.
Similarly to SERMs, phyto-SERMs act on the estrogen receptor in a selective manner, either as agonists, or as antagonists, thereby granting the possibility to selectively stimulate or inhibit estrogen-like responses in different tissues. The molecular basis for this discrimination lies in the variability of transcription coregulators in different tissues which interact with the estrogen receptor. Furthermore many phytoestrogen (including phyto-SERMs) appear to be somewhat selective in binding for the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) compared to the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) paralog. These two forms of the estrogen receptor display somewhat different tissue distributions and regulate a partially overlapping set of genes.
PhytoSERMs' unique mechanism of action, being able to target specific tissues precisely while unaffecting others, may make them safer candidates for treatment of estrogen deficiencies. 
Indications.
PhytoSERMs are suitable for treating estrogen deficiencies that cause menopause symptoms, osteopenia and osteoporosis.

Iridoideae

Iridoideae subfamily is one of the two main subfamilies in the popular Iridaceae family. It contains the best-known genus - "Iris". The members of this subfamily are widely distributed all over the world. They grow in all continents except Antarctica.
They produce typical sword-shaped leaves and have mainly corms or rhizomes. There are some exceptions which have bulbs. These are two subgenera of "Iris" - "Xiphium" and "Hermodactyloides". 
The blooms, which are often scented, are arranged in often terminal inflorescences. Each flower has six petals. In most cases three of them are separated from the others and are specialized in different functions. However some are not, as in "Nemastylis". Nectar is produced in their base. In some of the species the stamens are partially fused with the petals. 
The 3-locular seed capsule contains the seeds which are often circular, flat in some cases drop-like grains coloured black or sometimes orange ("Iris pseudacorus"). 
The species in the subfamily are often used as ornamental plants such as "Iris" and "Tigridia". There are also species members which are at risk in their natural environment such as some subspecies of "Ferraria crispa" and "Moraea villosa".

Gloydius ussuriensis

Gloydius ussuriensis is a venomous pitviper species endemic to far east Russia, northeastern China and the Korean Peninsula. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Description.
The scalation usually includes 21 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, all of which are keeled (although the keels on the first scale rows are faint), 146-157 ventral scales, and 39-54 subcaudal scales. There are 7 supralabial scales, with the second being the smallest and the fourth usually the largest.
The color pattern consists of a light brownish gray to blackish ground color overlaid with a series of 24-33 relatively large and usually elliptical dorsolateral blotches. These blotches, which may oppose or alternate on either side of the middorsal line, are usually closed and have a pale interior with a dark smudge in the center that makes them look like a row of bull's-eyes on either side of the body. The bloches are separated laterally by one scale row, extend down to the first scale row, and may merge with blotches across the middorsal line. A dark postocular stripe is present that is bordered above by a narrow yellow or white line.
Geographic range.
Found in far east Russia (Primorskiy Kray), northeastern China, North Korea and South Korea, as well as on Quelpart Island. Chernov proposed that the type locality be restricted to "Suchan River (in Primorskiy Kray)."
Taxonomy.
This species has long been confused with "G. saxatilis" in Korea and "G. blomhoffii brevicaudus" in eastern parts of Liaoning in China, where it is sympatric with these forms. Its variable color pattern has not helped matters either.

Home and Colonial Stores

Home & Colonial Stores was once one of the United Kingdom's largest retail chains. Its formation of a vast chain of retail stores in the late 1920s is seen as the first step in the development of a UK food retail market dominated by a small number of food multiples.
History.
The business was founded by Julius Drewe who in 1883 went into partnership with John Musker selling groceries at a small shop in Edgware Road in London. He subsequently opened stores in Islington, Birmingham and Leeds. The shops mainly sold tea and by 1885 they were trading as the "Home & Colonial Tea Association".
William Slaughter took over the Chairmanship of the business on incorporation in 1888. By the turn of the century the Company had over 100 stores and by 1903 it had 500.
Between 1924 and 1931, several stores, including Liptons merged with Home & Colonial to form a company with over 3,000 branches. Within this period of rapid change, Home & Colonial formed Allied Suppliers to act as a buyer on behalf of the whole group.
From 1948 until 1964 the group Chairman and CEO was Sir Lancelot Royle KBE. He had joined the group in 1928. By 1955 the company was ranked 27th largest in UK.
By 1960, Home & Colonial Stores Ltd was still a major force in the UK food industry. With retail operations in the UK and abroad and factories in the UK, it was able to report a 10% rise in profits to £4,033,057.
By 1961, reflecting the end of the British Empire, the group had restyled itself under the name of the company it created in 1929, Allied Suppliers. Early in 1972, Allied was acquired by Cavenham Foods, formed six years previously by British entrepreneur James Goldsmith. Melia's Grocers and Tea Dealers, another popular grocery chain at the time, was forced to amalgamate with the Home and Colonial company due to competition from larger national supermarkets.
By 1981, Allied had a turnover of £800m. In the following year Allied was acquired by James Gulliver's Argyll Foods and five years later Argyll merged with Safeway UK.
In literature.
Home and Colonial was one of three stores immortalised in a verse in John Betjeman's poem "Myfanwy":
"Smooth down the Avenue glitters the bicycle,"<br>
"Black-stockinged legs under navy blue serge,"<br>
"Home and Colonial, Star, International",<br>
"Balancing bicycle leant on the verge."<br>
In Dorothy Sayers' "Busman's Honeymoon" (1935), the "Home and Colonial" network is mentioned as maintaining a branch also at the small Herefordshire village where the book's plot is set - indicating its wide reach at the time of writing. A local woman tells Lord Peter Wimsey and his servant Bunter that groceries sold at the "Home and Colonial" are "better and half a penny cheaper" than those provided by the village's unaffilated grocer.

County Antrim &amp; District F.A.

The County Antrim & District Football Association (also known as the North East Ulster Football Association but more commonly as the Co. Antrim FA) is the largest of the four regional football associations within Northern Ireland and affiliated to the Irish FA, the others being the Mid-Ulster FA, the North-West of Ireland FA and the Fermanagh & Western FA.
History.
The Co. Antrim FA held its inaugural meeting on 23 April 1888 at the Commercial Hotel, Donegall Street, Belfast. The founding seven member clubs were Belfast Athletics, Cliftonville, Clarence, Distillery, YMCA, Oldpark and Whiteabbey. These clubs were joined shortly thereafter by Ballyclare, Linfield Athletics, Mountcollyer and Beechmount. In the intervening years the membership has grown from these eleven clubs to in excess of 500.
Aided by a grant from the Irish FA, the Co. Antrim FA set about organising a competition for its members, the County Antrim Senior Challenge Shield, for which the first round draw was made in November 1888. Also organised were a fund raising match, held between Cliftonville and "The Rest", and a first representative fixture, lost 6-2 to a touring side from Canada. In the first few years of its existence Co. Antrim FA XIs also faced teams representing Co. Londonderry, Mid-Ulster and the Irish FA.
Continued expansion of football in the region permitted the Co. Antrim FA to found further competitions, the Steel & Sons Cup in 1895 and the County Antrim Junior Shield in 1900. Regular representative fixtures continued until the 1950s when financial losses incurred on trips to face the Sheffield and Hallamshire FA proved too much for the Association to bear.
In 1988, to celebrate the Co. Antrim FA's centenary a special competition was organised - The County Antrim FA Centenary Chalice. The specially produced crystal trophy was won by Glentoran who defeated Ballymena United 4-2 in the final at Windsor Park, Belfast. That same season a County Antrim Select lost 6-2 to a Combined Mid-Ulster/North-West Select in a commemorative match at Windsor Park.
Today.
The Co. Antrim FA now has over 500 member clubs, spread beyond the traditional boundaries of Co. Antrim into mid-, north and east County Down. Membership comes from all levels of football within Northern Ireland, from the senior, intermediate, junior and youth leagues and includes the reserve teams of many IFA Premiership clubs.

Copeville, Texas

Copeville is an unincorporated community in southeastern Collin County, Texas, United States, along State Highway 78 near the east shore of Lavon Lake.
History.
Copeville was named for John Miles Cope (5 Jan 1827 – 14 Jul 1902), one of the earliest settlers to arrive in the area. Along with his father and brother he organized the community in the 1850s. In 1886 it moved about a mile east from its original location to its current site after the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was built through the area.
Population.
The population of Copeville may have reached 300 in 1915. The population estimate had fallen to 240 in 1926. It remained at that number throughout the 1920s and 1930s due to the Great Depression, mechanization of farming, and job opportunities offered in the Dallas metropolitan area. In 1943 a further decline to 150 was reported. Until the early 1970s that estimate remained constant. The town had two churches, five businesses, and a school in 1947.

Western Australian state election, 1977

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 19 February 1977 to elect all 55 members to the Legislative Assembly and 17 members to the 32-seat Legislative Council. The Liberal-National Country coalition government, led by Premier Sir Charles Court, won a second term in office against the Labor Party, led by Opposition Leader Colin Jamieson. 
The election produced a decisive victory for the Coalition, attributed by some observers to its strong and organised campaign, the Premier's ability in dealing with the media and good economic times built on resource exports, as contrasted against the Labor Opposition's often unfocussed campaign dwelling on the government's perceived autocratic methods and those sections of the general population which were not benefitting from the good times.

Billy Savidan

 
 
John William Savidan (23 May 1902 – 8 November 1991) nicknamed "Billy", "Bill" or "Jack" was a New Zealand long distance runner from 1926. 
He was born in Auckland.
At the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Ontario he won the six mile race despite stopping over the finish line after what he thought was the last lap, and being told that there was a lap to go, as the official had inadvertently turned over two discs instead of one. He beat Ernie Harper from England. In the three mile race (equivalent to 5000 meters) he did not finish. 
At the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles he finished fourth in both the 5000 metre event and the 10000 metre competition. 
He did not compete in the national championships in 1935 and 1936 as he was working as a stonemason and could not spend the necessary time training, but competed against two Japanese runners who were visiting New Zealand in 1937. Like Malcolm Champion before him he was then for some years Custodian at Auckland’s Tepid Baths.

Career.
Early career – 2008.
Contreras started in weightlifting at the age of 14. As a 17 year-old she won the silver medal at the 53 kg category from the 2003 Pan American Games, held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. As 17 years old, she won the Bronze medal at the 2004 Pan American Championships, held in May in Cali, Colombia, lifting 82.5 kg in snatch, 105 kg in Clean & Jerk and 187 kg in total in the 58 kg category. The Ecuadorian Alexandra Escobar won the gold and Canadian Maryse Turcotte the bronze medal. In the same year, during the National championship, she set a new record lifting 185 in total, 80 in snatch and 104 in clean & jerk. For all those achievements, she was chosen in her country "Weightlifting athlete of the Year". She participated in the 2005 World Weightlifting Championships, winning the bronze medal in the 53 kg category, lifting 95 kg in snatch and 116 kg in clean and jerk: 211 kg in total. This made her the second weightlifter from Dominican Republic to win a medal at the World Weightlifting Championships—the first was Eridania Segura in the 1992 edition.
In 2006, Contreras was selected by the local Olympic Committee and Cervecería Nacional Dominicana as Athlete of the Year for 2005 and received an award of RD$100,000 (approximately US$3,125 in May 2006). She dedicated the award to her mother and her coaches. Later that year, she won the silver medal at the 2006 Junior World Weightlifting Championship in snatch with 89 kg and bronze in total with 200 kg. In the 2006 Dominican Republic National Games, she represented the "East" region and won three medals in the 58 kg category, setting new records in all lifting styles with 90 kg in snatch, 110 kg in clean and jerk; 200 kg in total. With this she imitated her Cousin Wanda Rijo, who won three gold medals in the 1997 National Games. The 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games held at the Colombian city of Cartagena saw Contreras win the gold medal in snatch with 95 kg, the silver in clean and jerk with a 111 kg, and the gold medal in total with 206 kg in the Lightweight (– 58 kg) division. 
Following her success in 2006, she was listed among the Dominican Republic newspaper "Diario Libre"s "Men and Women of the Year".
In recognition of her athletic success representing her country, the Dominican Republic Sports Ministry rebuilt Contreras' house, being re-inaugurated in February 2007 by the Minister Felipe Payano. She traveled to Matanzas, Cuba to take part at XXVI Manuel Suárez International Weightlifting Tournament winning the gold medal in the 58 kg division with a 92 kg mark in snatch, 117 kg in clean & jerk and 209 kg in total, all of them new records for the competition.

After that winning she was promoted from Sergeant to Sergeant major. At the 2007 World Championships held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, she failed her three attempts in snatch, two with 92 kg and the last with 93 kg. She marked 107 kg in clean & jerk ranking 12th and ended with no mark in total in the under 53 kg category because of her snatch failure.
In 2008, the Dominican Republic Youth Ministry awarded Contreras for her success in the sports field as a youth, and she was recognized once again in "Dario Libre"s "Men and Women of the Year", receiving a Silver Tray as one of the 10 finalist for the main award. The 2008 Dominican Republic Military Games saw Contreras win the 58 kg for the later crowned event champion, the National Army. In early March, she won three gold medals at the 2008 Pan American Championships, qualifying her for the next Olympic Games. For her 2007 year-round performance, the San Pedro de Macorís Guild of Sport Writers awarded Contreras in May, as her province "Athlete of the Year". Before the Olympics, she had a two-month training in Bulgaria, trying to recover her legs strength. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, she ranked 5th with a total of 204 kg in the 53 kg category, after being trained by the Bulgarian coach Konstantin Darov.
2009 controversy – 2011.
After competing at the Olympics, Contreras tested positive for a CERA enhancer drug, and faced a two-year suspension, but the backup B sample was negative. At the end of the case, five athletes were sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee, but Contreras case was dismissed concluding that she did not violated any doping rule. She celebrated her 23rd birthday winning the 58 kg at the Military Games, helping the Dominican Army to win the weightlifting competition. For all her honors since 2003 until 2009, the Dominican Republic newspaper "Hoy" awarded her "Athlete of the Decade" in weightlifting.
In April 2010, Contreras set a new national record in snatch with 98 kg, winning three gold medals during the 58 kg division at the weightlifting tournament of the Dominican Republic Military Games. One month later, she won the silver medal at the 2010 Pan American Weightlifting Championships, after losing the gold medal to the Ecuadorian Alexandra Escobar in the under 58 kg category.
Due to stress-related weight loss, Contreras began competing in the 53 kg category later in 2010, and she won three gold medals at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games held in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, setting new records in snatch with 96 kg, 117 kg in clean and jerk, and 213 kg total weight. She received the support from the telephone company Tricom to train in Bulgaria as part of the company's "Tricom Sport Project", and she and national athletes Gabriel Mercedes and Victor Estrella later received incentives for RD$100,000 after winning. That September, Contreras won the silver medal in snatch and bronze in total at the 53 kg category from the 2010 World Weightlifting Championships in Antalya, Turkey.
In February 2011, she was promoted by the Dominican Republic Army from sergeant major to second lieutenant, and later that year she won the gold medal in the 53 kg category at the 2011 Pan American Games, setting a new record in snatch for the regional games with 96 kg. Competing at the 2011 World Weightlifting Championships in Paris, France, she won the silver medal with a 95 kg snatch lift in the – 53 kg, after winning she gave the credit to her coaches Héctor Domínguez, Félix Ogando and Belarusian Liavontsi Hancharenka.

Fishing.
The river was once frequented by salmon but their numbers have since declined. Brown trout are rife in the river, larger specimens can be caught in the narrower parts where the water runs deeper. Several 1 lb fish have been caught along with a record 4 lb brown trout which can be seen stuffed and mounted in the Talbot Hotel. Recently a two and a half pound fish was caught in the river. Many eels can also be found.

Battles of Latrun (1948)

The Battles of Latrun were a series of military engagements between the Israel Defense Forces and the Jordanian Arab Legion on the outskirts of Latrun between 25 May and 18 July 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Latrun takes its name from the monastery close to the junction of two major highways: Jerusalem to Jaffa/Tel Aviv and Gaza to Ramallah. During the British Mandate it became a Palestine Police base with a Tegart fort. The United Nations Resolution 181 placed this area within the proposed Arab state. In May 1948, it was under the control of the Arab Legion. It commanded the only road linking the Yishuv-controlled area of Jerusalem to Israel, giving Latrun strategic importance in the battle for Jerusalem.
Despite assaulting Latrun on five separate occasions Israel was ultimately unable to capture Latrun, and it remained under Jordanian control until the Six-Day War. Regardless, during the Battle for Jerusalem, the Jewish population of Jerusalem could still be supplied by a new road, named the "Burma Road", that bypassed Latrun and was suitable for convoys. The Battle of Latrun left its imprint on the Israeli collective imagination and constitutes part of the "founding myth" of the Jewish State. The attacks cost the lives of 168 Israeli soldiers, but some accounts inflated this number to as many as 2,000. The combat at Latrun also carries a symbolic significance because of the participation of Holocaust survivors.
Today, the battleground site has an Israeli military museum dedicated to the Israeli Armored Corps and a memorial to the Israeli War of Independence.
Background.
1948 Arab–Israeli War.
After the adoption of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in November 1947, a civil war erupted in the British Mandate of Palestine. The Jews living in Jerusalem constituted one of the weak points of the Yishuv and a main cause for concern to its leaders. With nearly 100,000 inhabitants, a sixth of the total Jewish population in the Mandate, the city was isolated in the heart of territory under Arab control.
In January, in the context of the "War of the Roads", the Holy War Army of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni besieged the Jewish part of the city and stopped convoys passing between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. By the end of March, the tactic proved its worth and the city was cut off. The Haganah then launched "Operation Nachshon", 4–20 April, and managed to force through a number of large convoys. Following the death of Abd al-Qader al-Husayni at al-Qastal, the Arab League's military committee ordered the other Arab force in Palestine, the Arab Liberation Army, to move its forces from Samaria (the northern part of today's West Bank) to the road of Jerusalem and the areas of Latrun, Ramla, and Lydda.
In the middle of May, the situation for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants of the city and the 30,000–40,000 in the outlying neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control of the city and the local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army to come to their aid.
On 15 May, the situation in the newly declared State of Israel and the remnants of Palestine was chaotic with the British leaving. The Jewish forces gained advantage over the Arab forces, but they feared the intervention of the Arab armies that had been announced for that day.
Geography.
Latrun is located at the crossroads between the Tel Aviv–Ramla–Jerusalem and Ramallah–Isdud roads in the area allocated to the Arab state by the United Nations Partition Plan. At that point, the Jerusalem road enters the foothills of Judea at Bab al-Wad (Sha'ar HaGai). The fort dominated the Valley of Ayalon, and the force that occupied it commanded the road to Jerusalem.
In 1948, Latrun comprised a detention camp and a fortified police station occupied by the British, a Trappist monastery, and several Arab villages: Latrun, Imwas, Dayr Ayyub and Bayt Nuba. During the civil war, after the death of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, the forces of the Arab Liberation Army positioned themselves around the police fort and the surrounding villages, to the indifference of the British. They regularly attacked supply convoys heading for Jerusalem. At that time, neither the Israeli nor Jordanian military staffs had prepared for the strategic importance of the place.
Prelude.
Operation Maccabi (8–16 May).
On 8 May, Haganah launched Operation Maccabi against the Arab Liberation Army and the Palestinian irregulars who occupied several villages along the Jerusalem road and prevented the resupplying of Jerusalem's Jewish community. The Givati Brigade (on the west side) and Harel Brigade (on the east side) were engaged in fighting, notably in the Latrun area.
Between 9–11 May, a battalion of the Harel brigade attacked and took the village of Bayt Mahsir, used by Palestinians as a base for the control of Bab al-Wad. The "Sha'ar HaGai" battalion of the Harel brigade also took up a position on the hills north and south of the road. It had to withstand the fire of the Arab Liberation Army artillery and the "unusual" fire of British armoured vehicles, but succeeded in holding the position and entrenched there.
To the west, on 12 May, Givati brigade troops took the British detention camp on the road leading to Latrun, but abandoned it the next day. Between 14 and 15 May, its 52nd battalion took the villages of Abu Shusha, Al-Na'ani and al-Qubab north of Latrun, thus cutting off the zone from Ramla, the main Arab town in the area. Lapierre and Collins report also that a platoon of the Givati brigade fired on and then penetrated the fort without encountering any resistance on the morning of 15 May. Again to the east, on 15 May, the troops of the Harel brigade took Dayr Ayyub, which they abandoned the next day.
It is at this time that the Israeli officers in the field appreciated the strategic importance of Latrun. A report was sent from OC Harel brigade to OC Palmach that concluded that "The Latrun junction became the main point in the battle Jerusalem" words must be taken from the source, but "that appreciation was not shared by the staff one week previously". Meanwhile, because of the Egyptian Army's advance, the Givati brigade got an order to redeploy on a more southern front, and the Harel brigade to remain in the Jerusalem sector. This decision to leave the area, and the fact of not planning for its strategic importance, would later be a source of controversy between Haganah chief of operations Yigael Yadin and Yitzhak Rabin, commander of the Harel brigade.
The Arab Legion takes control.
During the confusion of the last days of the British Mandate and with the "entry in war" of the Arab armies, the position at Latrun changed hands without combat. Firstly, around 14–15 May, an order was given to Fawzi al-Qawuqji and his Arab Liberation Army to withdraw and to leave the place to the Arab Legion. According to Yoav Gelber, this departure occurred before the arrival of the Jordanian troops at Latrun and the position was held by just 200 irregulars. Benny Morris nevertheless points out that a platoon of legionnaires of the 11th Company along with irregulars was there and took over the fort.
Indeed, as auxiliary forces of the British in Mandatory Palestine, several elements of the Arab Legion served in Palestine during the Mandate. The British had promised that these units would be withdrawn before the end of April, but for "technical reasons", several companies didn't leave the country. John Bagot Glubb, the commander of the Arab Legion, formed them into one division with two brigades, each made up of two infantry battalions, in addition to several independent infantry companies. Each battalion was given an armored-car company, and the artillery was made into a separate battalion with three batteries. Another "dummy" brigade was formed to make the Israelis believe it was a reserve brigade, thus deterring them from counterattacking into Transjordan.
On 15 May, the Arab states entered the war, and Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and Egyptian contingents deployed in Palestine. Among these, the Jordanian expeditionary corps was mainly constituted by an elite mechanized force "encadrée" by British officers and named Arab Legion. It comprised:
Glubb first realized ("pris conscience") the strategical importance of Latrun in the Battle of Jerusalem. His objective was twofold: he wanted to prevent the Israelis from strengthening Jerusalem and from supplying the city, and he wanted to "make a diversion" to keep the strengths of the Haganah far from the city, warranting to the Arabs the control of East Jerusalem. In addition to the 11th Company already there, he sent to Latrun the whole 4th Regiment. During the night between 15 to 16 May, the first contingent of 40 legionnaires seconded by an undetermined number of Bedouins strengthened the position, and the remainder of the regiment reached the area on 17 May.
On 18 May, the strength of the Arab Legion deployed around Latrun and Bab al-Wad was sufficient, and the road was blocked again. The Israeli general staff needed several days to asses the actual disposition of the Jordanian forces around Latrun and Jerusalem because these latter were thought to be at several locations in the country.
Situation in Jerusalem.
At Jerusalem, after the successful offensives that enabled the Jewish forces to take control of the buildings and strongholds that had been abandoned by the British, Glubb Pasha sent the 3rd Regiment of the Arab Legion to strengthen the Arab irregulars and fight the Jewish forces. After "violent" fighting, the Jewish positions in the Old City of Jerusalem were threatened (this felt indeed on 28 May). "We have surrounded the town": on 22 and 23 May, the second Egyptian brigade, composed mainly of several battalions of irregulars and several units of the regular army, reached the southern outskirts of Jerusalem and continued to attack at Ramat Rachel.
Glubb nevertheless knew that the Israeli army would sooner or later be stronger than his and that he had to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.
On the Israeli side, several leaders of the Jewish city sent emergency telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate and that they could not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.
Battles.
Operation Bin Nun Alef (24–25 May).
The task to lead Operation Bin Nun ("lit." Nun's son, in reference to Joshua, Nun's son, conqueror of Canaan according to the Book of Joshua) was given to Shlomo Shamir, a former officer of the British army. His force consisted of 450 men of the Alexandroni Brigade and 1,650 men of the 7th Brigade. Of these, about 140 to 145 were immigrants who had just arrived in Israel, nearly 7% of the total. Their heavy weaponry was limited to two French mortars of 1906 (nicknamed "Napoleonchik"), one mortar with 15 rounds of ammunition, one "Davidka", ten mortars and twelve armored vehicles. Three hundred soldiers of the Harel Brigade were also in the area but were not aware of the operation, but assisted after finding out about it by intercepting a radio transmission.
The Jordanian forces were under the order of Lieutenant Colonel Habes al-Majali. He "disposed" of the 4th Regiment and 600 Jordanian volunteers seconded by 600 local volunteers. The 2nd Regiment of the brigade, commanded by Major Geoffrey Lockett, had just left Jerusalem and arrived at Latrun during the battle. The brigade totalled 2,300 men seconded by 800 auxiliaries. It had at its disposal 35 armoured vehicles with 17 Marmon-Herrington Armoured Cars each armed with an anti-tank 2 pounder gun. For artillery it had eight 25 pounder Howitzers/Field guns, eight 6 pounder anti-tank guns, ten 2 pounder anti-tank guns also sixteen 3-inch mortars.
Zero Hour (that is, the start of the attack) was first fixed for midnight 23 May. But it was delayed 24 hours because it had not been possible to gather troops and weapons in time. Because no reconnaissance patrol was made the Israelis didn't know the exact composition of enemy forces. Intelligence reports just talked about "local irregular forces". On 24 May at 19:30, Shlomo Shamir was warned that an enemy force of around 120 vehicles, comprising armoured vehicles and artillery, was probably moving towards Latrun, urged an attack. The attack was postponed by 2 hours and fixed at 22:00. The attack was planned on two axes:
During the night, something unexpected happened: a roadblock on the road that had to be used by the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.
In front of the total failure of the attack, Shlomo Shamir ordered the retreat at 11.30 am. But this occurred on open ground under a heavy sun and the soldiers had no water. Numerous men were killed or injured by Arab fire. It was only at 2 pm that the first injured men reached the transport they had left in the morning. However, the Arab Legion didn't take advantage of this victory while, according to Benny Morris, it could easily have performed a counter-attack up to the Israeli headquarters located at Hulda.
Jordanians and Arab irregulars had 5 deaths and 6 injured. The Israelis counted 72 deaths (52 from the 32nd Battalion and 20 from the 72nd Battalion), 6 prisoners and 140 injured. Ariel Sharon, the future Prime Minister of Israel, a lieutenant at the time, headed a platoon of the 32nd Battalion and suffered serious injury to his stomach during the battle.
Reorganisation of the central front.
At the end of May, David Ben-Gurion was convinced that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.
From a military point of view, the 10th Harel Brigade required reinforcements and Ben-Gurion dispatched a battalion of the 6th Etzioni Brigade. He considered it imperative that the 7th Brigade join the forces in Jerusalem as well as a contingent of 400 new recruits to reinforce the Harel Brigade. Weapons and spare parts that had arrived in Israel by air were also now ready for combat on the Jerusalem front. The commander of the 7th Brigade wished to neutralize the negative effects of the debacle on the morale of the troops and on his prestige. The central front was reorganized and its command given to an American volunteer fighting on the Israeli side, Colonel David Marcus, who was subsequently appointed "Aluf" (Major General). He took command of the Etzioni and 7th Brigades, and the 10th Palmach Harel Brigade.
Operation Bin Nun Bet.
Shlomor Shamir was once again given the command of the operation. He sent the 7th Brigade and the 52nd Battalion of the Givati Brigade that replaced the 32nd that had been decimated in the previous battle. The 73rd Battalion was an armored force of light infantry with flame-throwers and 22 "military cars" made locally.
The Israelis sent numerous reconnaissance patrols but they nevertheless had no clear idea of the adversary's forces. They expected to fight 600 men of the Legion and of the Arab Liberation Army, so a force was allocated that was not enough to hold the Latrun front. Jordanians still had in fact a full brigade and are supported by several hundreds of irregulars. Taking into account the mistakes of the previous attacks, the renewed assault was organised with precision, and the area from where the units had to launch their attack had been cleared on 28 May. In particular the two hamlets of Bayt Jiz and Bayt Susin, where a counter-attacks had been launched by the Arab militants during the first battle, and Hill 369. The attack was once more foreseen on two axes:
Around midnight, the men of the 72nd and the 52nd passed Bab al-Wad noiselessly and then separated towards their respective targets. One company took Deir Ayyub, which was empty, but then were discovered as they did so by enemies on a nearby hill. They suffered the joint fire of the Legion's artillery and machines guns. Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al-Wad. The 52nd Battalion was preparing to take the hill in front of Yalu, but received an order to retreat.
On the other front, the forces divided in two parts. The infantry of the 71st rapidly took the monastery and then fought for the control of the town. On the other side, the Israeli artillery succeeded in neutralizing the fort's weapons. The volunteers crossed the defence fence and their flame-throwers took the defenders by surprise. Nevertheless, the light coming from the fire they created lost their cover and they became easy targets for the mortars of the Jordanians. They were quickly knocked out and destroyed. The sappers succeeded nevertheless to make the door explode, but in the confusion were not followed by the infantrymen. Chaim Laskov, the chief of operations on that front, ordered company D of the 71st Battalion (that had been kept in reserve) to intervene, but one of the soldiers accidentally exploded a landmine, killing three men and injuring several others. They were then attacked by heavy fire from the Jordanian artillery and the men retreated towards the west in panic.
The battle was still not lost for the Israelis although the wake was coming, and Laskov considered that his men could not hold in front of a Legion's counter-attack and he preferred to order the retreat. It was also time for the Jordanians to regroup, their 4th Regiment was completely out of ammunition. 73rd Battalion suffered 50% losses and the whole of the engaged forces had counted 44 deaths and twice that number injured. According to the sources, the Legion suffered between 12 and 20 deaths, including the lieutenant commanding the fort. In contrast, the Jordanians reported 2 just deaths on their side, and 161 of the Israelis.
David Marcus later attributed the responsibility for the defeat to the infantry, stating: "the artillery cover was correct. The armoury were good. The infantry, very bad". Benny Morris considers that the mistake was rather to disperse the forces on several objectives instead of concentrating the full brigade on the main objective: the fort.
"Burma Road".
On 28 May, after they took Bayt Susin, the Israelis controlled a narrow corridor between the coastal plain and Jerusalem. But this corridor was not crossed by a road that could have let trucks supply the city. A foot patrol of the Palmach discovered some paths that linked several villages in the hills south of the main road controlled by the Arab Legion. In the night of 29–30 May, Jeeps sent into the hills confirmed there was a path suitable for vehicles. The decision was then taken to build a road in the zone. This was given the name of "Burma Road", referring to the supply road between Burma and China built by the British during World War II.
Engineers immediately started to build the road while convoys of jeeps, mules and camels were organised from Hulda to carry mortars to Jerusalem. Without knowing the goals of these works, the Jordanians realised a game was afoot in the hills. They performed artillery bombings, that would anyway have been rapidly stopped under the orders of the top British officer, and they sent patrols to stop the works, but without success.
Nevertheless, it was mainly food that the inhabitants of Jerusalem needed. Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that it let civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been cut by the Jordanians. In "O Jerusalem", Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic action, when during the night of 6–7 June, in fear of the critical situation of Jerusalem and to improve the morale of the population, 300 inhabitants of Tel Aviv were requisitioned to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed the inhabitants of Jerusalem one more day.
The first phase of these works was achieved for the 10 June truce and on 19 June a convoy of 140 trucks, each carrying three tons of merchandise as well as numerous weapons and ammunition, reached Jerusalem. The siege of the city was then definitively over. This Israeli success was punctuated by an incident that became marked in memory: the death of Aluf Mickey Marcus, accidentally killed by an Israeli sentry during the night of 10–11 June.
Operation Yoram (8–9 June 1948).
Between 30 May and 8 June the status between the Israeli and Arabic armies became a stand-off. They were used to fighting small, violent battles and taking heavy losses of people and arms, and the United Nations renewed its call for a truce on 11 June. It was in this context that David Ben-Gurion took the decision to withdraw from Galilee the elite 11th Yiftach Brigade under the orders of Yigal Allon to launch a third assault against Latrun. He had at his disposal an artillery support composed of four mortars and four guns that were part of the heavy weapons recently delivered to Israel by Operation Balak.
This time, the general staff decided on an attack concentrated on the centre of the Legion disposal, with several diversion attacks to the north to disrupt the Jordanians. While a battalion from the Yiftach Brigade was performed some diversions attacks on Salbit, Imwas and Bayt Nuba, a battalion from the Harel brigade was to take Hill 346, between the fourth and second Legion regiments and a battalion from the Yiftach Brigade was then to pass through it, take Hill 315 and Latrun village and the police fort by the East. The Israeli operation started with an artillery barrage on the fort, the village of Latrun and the positions around. Hills 315 and 346 occupied with a company from the Legion, were not targeted not to alert the Jordanians.
The men of the Harel brigade made leave on foot from Bab al-Oued but took a wrong way and mistakenly attacked Hill 315. Located by the Jordanian sentries, they launch the attack of the hill. The Legionnaires were outnumbered but counterattacked with violence, going as far as requiring an artillery bombing on their own position. The Israelis suffered some heavy losses. When the Yiftach arrived at the bottom of Hill 346, they are targeted by firearms, grenades and artillery. Thinking that Harel men were there, they called by radio to the headquarters to ceasefire, and laid down arms. They refused, not believing that account of the events and Harel soldiers stayed in place.
Confusion among Jordanians was as important as among Israelis with the attack on Hill 315 and those of diversion. With the incoming morning and unable to evaluate properly the situation, the Israeli HQ gave orders at 5.30 am for the soldiers to retreat to Bad al-Oued. The losses were also significant. Indeed the 400-strong Harel battalion numbered 16 dead and 79 injured, and the Yiftach an handful of dead and injured. The Legion numbered several dozen victims.
The following day, Jordan mounted two counter-attacks. The first was over Beit Susin. The Legionnaires took several Israeli guard posts but could not keep them more than a few hours. The fighting took lives and some 20 injuries on the Israeli side. The second was at Kibbutz Gezer from where the diversion attacks had been launched. A force the strength of a battalion, made up of Legionnaires and irregulars and supported by a dozen armoured vehicles, attacked the kibbutz in the morning. It was defended by 68 soldiers of the Haganah (including 13 women).
After the four-hour battle, the kibbutz fell. A dozen of the defenders escaped. Most others surrendered and one or two were executed. The Legionnaires protected the prisoners from irregulars and the next day freed the women. The toll was 39 dead on the Israeli side and 2 on the Legionnaires' side. The kibbutz was looted by the irregulars and the Legionnaires evacuated the area after the fights. In the evening the Yiftach Brigade retook the kibbutz.
Attacks organised during Operation Danny.
After the month of truce, during which Tsahal increased forces and re-equipped, the weakest point of the Israeli dispositions were on the central front and the corridor to Jerusalem. The High Command decided to launch "Operation Larlar" with the objective of taking Lydda, Ramle, Latrun and Ramallah and relieving the threat on Tel Aviv on a side and West Jerusalem on the other.
To achieve this objective Yigal Allon in entrusted 5 brigades: the Harel and Yiftach (now totalling five battalions), the 8th armoury brigade (newly constituted as the 82nd and 89th battalions), several infantry battalions from the Kiryati and Alexandroni brigades, and 30 pieces of artillery. The 7th brigade was sent to the northern front. In a first phase, between 9 and 13 July, the Israelis took Lydda and Ramle and reasserted the area around Latrun by taking Salbit, but the forces are exhausted and the High Command renounced to the objective of taking Ramallah. Two attacks was launched against Latrun.
On the east of the Jordanian positions (16 July).
On the night of 15–16 July, several companies of the Harel brigade laid on an assault against Latrun by the east, around the "artillery ridge" and the villages of Yalo and Bayt Nuba. They carried on to the hills by way of the villages of Bayt Thul and Nitaf transporting their armoury using pack mules. After several hours of fighting and counter-attacks by armoured vehicles of the Arab Legion, they were finally pushed back but could keep control of several hills. In total, the Israelis lost 23 dead and numerous injured.
Frontal assault against the police fort (18 July).
One hour before the truce, the High Command decided to try a frontal assault against the police fort. Intelligence indicated that, in effect, it was "more likely than not" that the Legion's forces in the sector were "substantial". In the morning, reconnaissance patrols had sized up the sector, but could not confirm or deny the information that had been gathered by the intelligence. At 6 pm two Cromwell tanks driven by British deserters, seconded by a mechanised battalion of the Yiftach and supported by artillery launched the attack of the police fort.
When the Israeli forces arrived from the fort, they were shelled by Jordanian artillery. Around 6:15 pm. one of the tanks was hit by a shell (or sustained a mechanical damage) and had to retreat to al-Qubab for repairs. The remaining forces waited for its return and the attack resumed around 7:30 pm, but was abandoned around 8 pm. The Israelis counted between 8 and 12 victims. At the same time, elements of the Harel brigade took about 10 villages to the south of Latrun to enlarge and secure the area of the Burma road. The majority of inhabitants had fled the fights in April but those who remained were systematically expelled.
The final assault ?
After the ten-day campaign, the Israelis were military superior to their enemies and the Cabinet subsequently considered where and when to attack next. 3 options were offered : attacking the Arabic enclave in Galilee held by the Arab Liberation Army ; moving eastward as far as possible in Samarian and Judean areas, taken by the Iraqis and Jordanians ; or attacking southern Negev taken by the Egyptians.
On 24 September, an incursion made by the Palestinian irregulars in the Latrun sector (killing 23 Israeli soldiers) precipitated the debate. On 26 September, David Ben-Gurion put his argument to the Cabinet to attack Latrun again and conquer the whole or a large part of West Bank.
The motion was rejected by 5 votes to 7 after discussions. According to Benny Morris, the arguments that were advanced not to launch the attack were: the negative international repercussions for Israel already accentuated by the recent assassination of Count Bernadotte; the consequences of an attack on an agreement with Abdallah; the fact that defeating the Arab Legion could provoke a British military intervention because of Britain and Jordan's common defense pact and lastly because conquering this area would add hundreds of thousands of Arab citizens to Israel.
Ben-Gurion judged the decision ("A cause for lamentation for generations") in considering that Israel could never renounce its claim in Judea, Samaria and over Old Jerusalem.
Aftermath.
At the operational level, the five assaults on Latrun were solved with Israeli defeats and Jordanian victories: the Jordanians repelled all assaults and kept control of the road between the coastal plain and Jerusalem, with Israel losing 168 killed and many more injured. Strategically, the outcome was more nuanced:
At the discussions of the Israeli-Jordano Armistice at Rhodes, the Israelis requested unsuccessfully the removal of the legion from Latrun. It subsequently remained under Jordanian control until the Six-Day War.
Historiography.
Israeli historiography and collective memory.
There is a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' and the image of the battle as retained in collective memory. This is certainly the case for the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.
The clear-sightedness of the Commander-in-Chief.
The first version of the battle of Latrun was contrived by David Ben-Gurion and his entourage.
Initially, the governing power within Israel remained silent. However, on May 27, the Israeli daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which spoke of a great victory by the Arab Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, the Israeli press stressed that the aim of the operation was not to take Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths for the Arab side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded on the Israeli side.
From 14 June, the press shifted its focus to the 'opening of the Burma route' and, in the context of a conflict between the military's senior command and Ben-Gurion, Yigael Yadin called the operation a 'great catastrophe' while the latter replied that, in his view, it had been "a great, although costly, victory".
The "official version" entered in the historiography in 1955 following the work of lieutenant colonel Israel Beer, whereas adviser and support of Yadin at the time of the events, who published 'The battles of Latrun'. This study, considered by the historian Anita Shapira as "the most clever ever written on the topic", puts the battles in their military and political context. It concludes that given the strategic and symbolic importance of Jerusalem, "the three tactical defeats that occurred at Latrun (...) permitted the supply the city and were a diversal manoeuvre (...) are the consequence of the strategic clear-sightedness of the Commander-in-Chief, able to identify the key points and subordinate to his general sight the tactical considerations, limited, of the military command.
Ber put the responsibility of the tactical defeats on the failures of the intelligence services and on the "absence de commandement séparé sur les différents fronts." He also points out the badly trained immigrants, the defective equipment, and the difficulty for a new army to succeed a first operation targeting to capture a defended area that was organised by advance. He gives the first estimates for the losses: 50 deaths in the 32nd battalion of the "Alexandroni" brigade and the 25 deaths in the 72nd battalion of the 7th brigade (composed mainly of immigrants).
Finally, Ber founded the myth and pictured the events of Latrun as "an heroic saga, as the ones that occurs at the birth of a nation or at the historical breakthrough of movements of national liberation".
Criminal negligence.
the First Battle of Latrun: "the Jordanians broke the attack by noon, with fewer than two thousand Israeli deaths."
Whereas many events in the war were more bloody for the Israelis, like the massacre at Kfar Etzion with 150 deaths or the one of the Mount Scopus with 78, the Battle of Latrun is the event of the war to provoke most rumours, narratives and controversies in Israel. The main reason is that Latrun had still been the mainstay for the road to Jerusalem until the Six-Day War, keeping the Israelis at the margins and having to go round and maintain the town, but struggling to bypass it, which played each day on their minds. According to Anita Shapira, the primary reason was nothing but people's grievous memories, of David Ben-Gurion and the veterans of the British Armies on one side and former Palmah and Haganah soldiers on the other. In this sphere of influence during the 1970s and in the controversies that continued until the 1980s, the "Strategic Necessity" was said, if it were not done, it would be "Criminal negligence", with a heavy toll on bring in immigrants to the battle, and forging a new founding myth.
On one side, the opponents of Ben-Gurion attacked his "moral authority". They said that the intrusion into Latrun by the "scum of the earth" immigrants who died had changed the situation for the worse. And the number of victims, and the proportion of immigrants, inflated in the narratives: from "several hundreds of dead" to "500 to 700 dead and even "1,000 to 2,000 dead". The proportion of immigrants making up this total of victims was up to 75%. His opponents accused Ben-Gurion of wanting to take out the myth of the "invincible Arab Legion" and to justify the abandonment of the city of David to Abdallah. (Anita Shapira considers this story to be at the origin of the theory of Avi Shlaim who brought forth what she considers as the myth of the collusion between Ben-Gurion and Abdallah.) On the other side, those supporting Ben-Gurion put everything to advance the case of the "historic sacrifice" by the immigrants, laying the failure to their poor training.
Many contemporary books about the 1948 War were published at this time: John and David Kimche, "The two sides of the hill" (1960) (the more reliable); Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, "O Jerusalem" (1972) (the best known internationally) and Dan Kurzman, "Genesis, 1948" (1970) (the only one that got reviews in the Israeli press). With this political writing, historical research on Latrun tends to concentrate on the 1980s with the work of Arié Itzhaki, "Latrun" (in 2 volumes). It gives the exact number of victims, but, at the contrary of Israel Beer (meanwhile caught as spying for USSR), it depicts the battle as "The hardest in the history of Tsahal", and it puts the responsibility of the defeat on Ben-Gurion, who panicked about Jerusalem, and tactical errors on the brigade commanders and not on the immigrants who received (from his point of view) a sufficient training.
The drama of alienation.
In the first years after its foundation, Israel met a problem with social integration of new immigrants who had arrived after the war, who had received much trauma from their exodus from Arab lands or from the death camps, and had suffered six years of war. Their integration was difficult with Sabra Israelis, born in the Palestinian Mandate, and taking the essential jobs and around who Israel had built an image of "Sabras, strong and courageous, fearless heroes, disdaining feebleness and trouble". The phenomenon rose up again with the Israeli victory of the Six-Day War.
All the while, these uncertainties and the reparations from the Yom Kippur War polished the sheen on the Shoah. The collective memory resurfaced and looked to reconcile its past history of difficulties, suffering and sacrifices. A new elite arose from the Sephardic Jews and the "can-do" of Menahem Begin. In this context, the "myth" of Latrun derived from the frustrations and the death of the new immigrants and was catalysed by their integration in a society where "the survivor of Shoah carried the new collective memory, immigrant refugees who had troubled pasts, and then were confronted with hostility and threat and still took their place with their blood and taking part in the war".
This myth was founded in the factual knowledge of the immigrants' participation in the battles, and the mythical knowledge because of the differences in the number of victims, the leaving of the injured on the fields of battle, and that the Latrun battle was the hardest and most important in the war. The influence on written history appeared primarily in books and commentary, where "the immigrants wanted only to make sure that their contribution at the battle was written in the collective memory with a plus sign". It didn't bring new documents but it expressed itself in memoirs, reminiscences and obituaries by or of those involved in the events. It was a view that was seldom heard in polemics giving two preceding versions of events but that had a life of its own, given to it by the immigrants.
Myth of guilt.
In the 1980s, a schism arose within the post-Zionism movement, and the history of the battle of Latrun came to represent the culpability of the Israeli state and a way of pointing out that it was born in the context of massacres and the exodus of the Palestinian population. It shouted "hypocrisy", "false truths", and "the blood of the escapees of Shoah who came to find a new life and yet found death".
This version was put into several poems by the celebrated provocative poet Gabi Daniel (pseudonym of Benjamin Harushovsky-Harshav) and entitled "Peter the Great". Themes in the poem include dehumanisation and how Ben-Gurion got Shoah into his pocket, by the work of the other "innocent young Jews of the Superior Race, who, without name or vision, found themselves the saviours of Israel".
Anita Shapira considers this "New myth" was necessary not to reject identity with the past and to be able to renounce their common memory. While Israel in the 1980s was under much criticism from myths about the state's founding, the reception of this idea was mitigated and "this version of Latrun that was destined to blow up the myth that the regathering was solely in the hands of a group of radicals in the middle of the intellectual community".
Qirbet Quriqur.
A battle fought in this zone and tragic for the Israelis was completely eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received the order to capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting the only way for the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres to the north of the place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.
Despite this bloodbath, Anita Shapira underlines that this battle didn't remain in the Israeli collective memory. "If success has numerous fathers, [...] defeat remains an orphan. [...] The deaths of Qurikur did not enter into the pantheon of the Israeli national memory. [...] there were numerous polemics about Latrun, that 45 soldiers perished [...] should have begged a question. But they died in a side of the arena that proved to be unimportant, given it was not to decide the outcome of the campaign.
Commemoration.
After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, the army came to arm the most important place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum was built on the old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.
Jordanian historiography.
According to Eugène Rogan, the Jordanian history of the war is essentially that of the recollections by Jordanian officers who took part in the fighting, or of nationalist historians. He states that these "non-critical" works are largely loyal to the Jordanian regime and quotes "My memoirs" by Habes al-Majali, commander of the 4th Regiment; "The battles of Bad al-Oued" by Mahmoud al-Ghussan, one of the High Command officers; "On the road to Jerusalem" by Ma'n Abu Nuwar, an officer of the Arab Legion, Jordanian soldier and "Soldier with the Arabs" with John Bagot Glubb. Jordanian historiography declares Latrun as a great success of the Arab Legion in the defense of Jerusalem, where a contingent of 1,200 men resisted an assault of 6,500 Israeli soldiers, and claiming Israeli casualties of between 400 and 800 killed. Glubb claimed 600 deaths on the first assault and 600 others for the two after.
Habes al-Majali is quoted as the only Arab commander to have defeated the Israelis in 1948 and who restored a little honour to the Arabs. By his version of events, he would even have catch Ariel Sharon in the course of the battle and it is Colonel Ashton (his British superior from 3rd Brigade) would have forbidden him to use the artillery against the Burma road, action by which he could have prevented its construction. After the war, he was appointed bodyguard of Abdallah and in 1957 Chief-of-Staff of the Jordanian army. He became Jordanian Minister of Defence in 1967.
Palestinian historiography and collective memory.
The Palestinian account of the battle is much the same as the Israeli one. It is, after, all, based on the Israeli one but gives no weight or symbolic character to it. In his work "All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948" Walid Khalidi refers to Operation Maccabi as the first assault. He reports that the resistance offered by the Arab Legion and the volunteer army were "inspired by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni" (who had been killed a month before).
Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and collective memory point out that during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened could be seen as ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, so as not to be used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.

Wall Arch

Wall Arch was a natural sandstone arch in the Arches National Park in the U.S. state of Utah. Before its collapse in 2008, it was ranked 12th in size among the park's over 2,000 arches. At its largest, the opening underneath the span was wide by high. It consisted of Entrada Sandstone, specifically the member known as Slick Rock. Wall Arch was first reported and named in 1948 by Lewis T. McKinney.
Wall Arch collapsed sometime between the night of August 4, 2008, and the morning of August 5, temporarily blocking Devil's Garden Trail. No one observed the fall. It was the first collapse of a major arch in the park since sections of Landscape Arch fell in 1991. Officials from the National Park Service and Utah Geological Survey visited the site of the collapsed sandstone arch on Thursday, August 7, and noted stress fractures in the remaining formation which may cause collapses in the future.

Accountable America

Accountable America is a left-wing political group created in the summer of 2008. Its goal is to reduce political donations to conservative 527 groups.
Founded by liberal political operative Tom Matzzie, the group's first activity was a letter sent to donors warning them that giving to conservative causes might lead to legal trouble or cause political activists to research their background and past activities for humiliating material that could be made public, techniques that founder Tom Mattzie described as “going for the jugular.”. 
The group has offered a $100,000 reward for information on a conservative independent group that can show criminal or civil illegality.
The group raised $200,000 in its first two weeks.
Judd Legum, research director in the presidential campaign or Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, is research director for the organization.

Nicholas Angell

Nicholas "Nick" Angell (born October 31, 1979) is an American professional ice hockey player currently playing for the Swedish club Karlskrona HK of the HockeyAllsvenskan.
Angell is a very offensive defenseman who likes to join the rush, acting as a fourth forward at times. Angell is a strong skater and plays a physical game. His slapshot is hard and accurate, making him a valuable player on the power play and a threat to goalies.
Early career.
Angell began his ice hockey career playing in the Duluth youth leagues where he honed his skills before playing at Duluth East High School. During his senior year, Angell led the Duluth East Greyhounds in winning the 1998 Minnesota High School Boys Hockey tournament, and was nominated for the Mr. Hockey award, which is given to Minnesota's most valuable high school hockey player. He was then recruited to play for the University of Minnesota in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, from 1998 to 2002, where he helped Minnesota win their fifth NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship in 2002.
Professional career.
Angell began his professional career in 2002–03, playing several games with the Milwaukee Admirals, the Nashville Predators' minor league affiliate in the AHL. He then spent the rest of the season with the Rockford Icehogs in the IHL, totaling 16 points in 73 games.
The next season (2003–04), Angell was signed by IFK Arboga, in the Swedish tier two league. During the 2004-05 season, he played for the Frisk Tigers in the Norwegian Elite League, before returning to the Swedish tier two league with Bofors IK, for the 2005-06 season. In 2006, Angell signed with the Swedish Elite League team Brynäs IF where he played for two seasons.
In 2007, Angell was selected to play for Team USA in the Deutschland Cup, where the United States finished in 2nd place after losing to Switzerland 3-2, in an overtime shootout. In 2008, he signed a one-year contract with the 2007–08 Swedish Elite League Champions HV71, after playing a few games for the Tampere Battle Axe, in Finland. Angell joined HV71 for the 2008–09 season, after briefly playing the beginning of the season with the Norwegian team Stavanger Oilers. After playing five seasons in Sweden, Angell moved to Germany for the 2009-10 season after signing with the Frankfurt Lions in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. 
In 2010, Angell played in the Kontinental Hockey League, after signing with Metallurg Novokuznetsk. With 18 points in 51 games, he ended up being the club's top-scoring defenceman, but as Metallurg lost all chances to make the playoffs, Nick was traded to Avangard Omsk just hours before the trade deadline on 31 January 2011. While playing for Metallurg in the KHL, Angell was the first American to be named captain of a Russian professional ice hockey team. Angell returned to the Deutsche Eishockey Liga for the 2011-12 season after signing with Eisbären Berlin.
After retiring for one year, Nicholas has returned to Sweden in the all-svenskan league for Karlskrona Hockey Klub. He was married on September 14 to an American woman. For the 2013-2014 season, he was appointed Captain of the team.
Awards.
In 2008, Angell received 4% of the votes in an internet survey for the World's Sportsman of the Year. The survey was conducted by a Finnish newspaper, Ilta-Sanomat. Angell finished fourth together with Argentine footballer Lionel Messi and just ahead of Alexander Ovechkin, of the Washington Capitals.

<doc id="18795947" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18795947" title="Disulfur">
Disulfur

Disulfur is the diatomic molecule with the formula S2. It is analogous to the dioxygen molecule but rarely occurs at room temperature. This violet gas is commonly generated by heating sulfur above 720 °C and comprises 99% of the vapor at low pressure (1 mm Hg) at 530 °C. S2 is one of the minor components of the atmosphere of Io, which is predominantly composed of SO2. Diatomic molecules are common containing C, O, N, and F, but for heavier elements they are often only stable at high temperatures.
Production.
Disulfur results when an atmosphere of COS is irradiated with UV light using a mercury photosensitizer or when CS2, H2S2, S2Cl2 or C2H4S are photolyzed. Singlet S2 is also formed when sulfur compounds such as H2S, PSF3 or COS are photolyzed. S2 can be generated by heating various organosulfur precursors.
Properties.
S2 exists in the triplet state (is a diradical, with two unpaired electrons) like O2 and SO. It has the S-S double bond length of 189 pm, much shorter than the S-S single bonds in S8, which are 206 pm long. In its Raman spectrum, the S-S vibrational band is observed at 715 cm−1. The corresponding vibrational band of O-O is found at 1122 cm−1. The S-S bond energy is 265 kJ/mol compared to 498 kJ/mol for O2. 
Sulfur has a large number of allotropes, perhaps as many as thirty. Their specific properties are distinguishable by various types of spectroscopy. The only stable form of sulfur at normal conditions is S8.

Carl Rungius

Carl Clemens Moritz Rungius (August 18, 1869 – October 21, 1959) was a leading American wildlife artist. He was born in Germany though he immigrated to the United States and he spent his career painting in the western United States and Canada. Active primarily in the first half of the 20th century, he earned a reputation as the most important big game painter and the first career wildlife artist in North America.
Early Life in Germany.
Rungius was born in Rixdorf, now a part of Berlin, Germany, to Pastor Heinrich Rungius (1833-1922) and Magdalene Fulda. Rungius spent most of his childhood in Britz, also part of Berlin. Rungius had seven sisters and one brother. His family had interests in art, nature, and taxidermy, and from an early age, Rungius enjoyed hunting and knew he wanted to be a wildlife painter. Upon reaching school age, Carl was sent away to live with his widowed grandmother in the village of Burg bei Magdeburg. He demonstrated a passion for hunting from a young age, and it’s this passion which would dominate his later life and be a tremendous influence on his artwork. From an early age, Rungius also showed ambition to be an artist. In his teenage years, an exhibition by Richard Friese, Germany’s foremost wildlife artist, reinforced Rungius’s ambition. He had several obstacles to overcome though before he would obtain his objective. Rungius had a tremendous dislike for school. Despite this, he completed his academic coursework and passed his examinations, qualifying for a mandatory year of military services. He served his one year of military service in 1891. His father also had strong oppositions to him becoming a painter. Eventually his father did relent, but only on the condition that Carl would start his profession in an acceptable fashion, by learning the trade of a house painter. For the next three summers, Rungius apprenticed as a wall and woodwork painter.
Rungius studied art at the Berlin Art Academy from 1888-1890. Rungius’s art education began with a course in ornamental design. He was not very interested in this however, and he increasingly spent his free time at the Berlin Zoo sketching and studying the animals there. Zoo animals were not subjects he could handle physically; he could not get under their skin and see for himself how muscle, bone, tendon and tissue melded together to form the living animal. In order to get a better look at the anatomy of animals, Rungius made frequent visits to the local glue factory to study animal anatomy in its most basic form. Rungius’s father often shot stray cats in his garden and would turn the carcass’s over to Carl. Although his work in the glue factory and with cats was unpleasant, Rungius felt it was critical to his artistic development.
Trip to the United States.
In 1894, Rungius's Uncle Clemens Fulda invited him to hunt moose in Maine. Shortly after, in 1895, he traveled to Wyoming, which for him was an exotic experience. Open skies, mountain scenes and big game abounded. He made extensive studies of his trophies, and stalked game, which allowed him to gain a better understanding of the animals he painted. His summer in Wyoming persuaded Rugius that the United States would be his new home; “I painted from the collected material and later in the spring of 1896, I went back to Germany...My decision to cut all ties with the Old World and to live in America got good was due in no small part to this first Wyoming trip. For my heart was in the West.”
In 1896, Rungius immigrated to the United States. After hunting and painting trips to New Brunswick in 1900-1909 and to the Yukon in 1904, Rugius’s fascination with the North American moose began. In 1907 Carl Rungius married his cousin Louise Fulda, who was 11 years his junior, in 1907. Louise was his Uncle Clemen’s daughter and Runguis had grown quite fond of Louise during the time he had spent living at his Uncle’s house in Maine. Louise and Carl knew they could never have children due to the fact that they were cousins, but neither of them seemed to express any regret about this decision.
Rungius found work, as hunters and naturalists commissioned wildlife illustrations for their magazines, books, and campaigns to protect endangered animals. Rungius’s arrival in the United States coincided with the recognition of the plight of the continent’s game animal and bird populations. Several concerned sportsmen had turned their energy to correcting the deteriorating situation, the most noteworthy being Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt was a leader in Conservation, fighting to end the waste of natural resources. Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act, under which he proclaimed 18 new United States National Monuments. He also established the first 51 Bird Reserves, four Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests, including Shoshone National Forest, the nation's first. Around 1909, Rungius gave up illustrating to pursue a career as a full-time easel painter. His illustrations, however, stayed in circulation long after, playing a large role in spreading information about ethical hunting. In early twentieth-century North America, there were few major zoos and photography was still in its infancy, so illustrations from books and periodicals were the public's main source of information concerning wildlife.
Trip to the Canadian Rockies.
In 1910, Banff tour guide Jimmy Simpson saw a reproduction of Rungius’s painting Wary Game, a painting of six Dall rams on a high spur of a wind-swept Yukon mountain ridge, in an issue of "The Bulletin" put out by the New York Zoological Society. Upon seeing the painting, Simpson declared “that fellow knows his animals and he knows his sheep.” Simpson wrote Rungius a letter in which he extended a generous invitation; if Rungius could get to Banff, Simpson would take him out on a sheep hunt at no cost. In 1910, Rungius accepted an offer to visit the Canadian Rockies, and would go on to paint a large number of his paintings there. He enjoyed the opportunities for hunting, exploration, and sport to such an extent that 1921, he built a studio in Banff, Alberta called "The Paintbox." Rungius said that “I could not think of any more suitable place than Banff in Alberta. A province which has practically every species within its borders. Easy to reach and a cosmopolitan, broad-minded town right in the wilderness, at the same time offering all the comforts of a big city. My wife who had been with me here a couple of times also liked Banff and approved the idea.” Rungius worked in his Banff studio from April to October every year until his death in 1959.
Art.
Rungius was an avid sportsman, and spent more time in the wilderness than other artists. By direct observation in nature, he was able to gain an exceptional insight into the animals and their environment. Rungius painted both landscapes and wildlife, often with both into a single picture. He situated animals in their natural environment, a practice that was new to painting in early twentieth century North America. His paintings are highly romanticized, and represent an Eden-like world without any signs of a human impact.
Among other places, his works are featured at the American National Museum of Wildlife Art (which has the largest public collection of Rungius work), the Dutch Rijksmuseum Twenthe, and Calgary's Glenbow Museum.
Associations and Clubs.
Rungius was made a member of The Camp Fire Club in 1896 (Runguis was in Germany when the club was founded but he was elected in absentina as one of the original twenty members). Rungius was also a member of the Boone and Crockett Club (member in 1927), The Salmagundi Club (1907), Outfitter for the annual climbing camps of the Alpine Club of Canada (1910), Associate Member of the National Academy of Design (1913, member and in 1920 he was elected as a full Academician), Honorary Scout with the Boy Scouts of America (1927), member of The Century Club, member of The Painters of the Far West, and a member Society of Animal Painters and Sculptors.
Scouting.
In 1927, the Boy Scouts of America created "Honorary Scouts" to distinguish "American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...". Rungius was one of eighteen who were awarded this distinction.
Death.
Rungius died October 21, 1959 in New York City. After his death, Eric Harvie, the founder of the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, bought the entire Rungius estate including paintings, sketches, photographs, personal belongings and mementos, and the entire contents of his Banff and New York studios. This huge collection of 1,404 items makes Glenbow Museum the premier research centre in the world for Rungius scholars.
Rungius had his ashes scattered on Tunnel Mountain in Banff, Alberta, loving the view overlooking the town and the Bow Valley.

<doc id="18796003" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18796003" title="Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963">
Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963

The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. At the time of its passage, the Act was intended to extend the protection of workplace health, safety and welfare under the Factories Act 1961 to other employees in Great Britain. Though some of it remains in force, it has largely been superseded by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and regulations made under it.
Breach of the residual provisions is still a crime punishable on summary conviction in the Magistrates' Court by a fine of up to £400 or, on indictment in the Crown Court, imprisonment for up to two years and an unlimited fine.
In the event of damage arising from a breach of the Act, there may be civil liability for breach of statutory duty. Though no such liability is stipulated by the Act itself, none is excluded and the facts could be such as to give rise to a cause of action in that tort. A breach not actionable in itself may be evidential towards a claim for common law negligence. In particular, a criminal conviction may be given in evidence.
Background.
The Act stemmed from the 1949 Gowers Report which had already led to the Mines and Quarries Act 1954, Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956 and Factories Act 1961. The 1963 Act extended protection to a further 8 million employees.
Health, safety and welfare of employees (general provisions).
Sections 4 to 16 defined general broad requirements for safe and healthy workplace working conditions:
These provisions were repealed and superseded, as far as they applied to "workplaces", by the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 with effect from 1 January 1993 for new workplaces and 1 January 1996 for established workplaces. There is still a potential residual scope of application to "offices, shops and railway premises" that are not "workplaces" as the definition of "workplace" is in some ways limited.
Section 17 made requirements for the safeguarding of machinery but was repealed and superseded by the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1992 between 1 January 1993 and 1 January 1997.
Section 18 prohibited persons under 18 from cleaning certain hazardous machinery but was repealed and superseded by the Health and Safety (Young Persons) Regulations 1997 on 3 March 1997.
Sections 20 to 22 gave the Secretary of State the power to make regulations under the Act but these powers were repealed with the coming into force of the 1974 Act.
Section 23 restricted manual lifting of weights that might cause injury but these requirements were repealed and superseded by the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 on 1 January 1993.

Nicolaus van Esch

Nicolaus van Esch (Eschius) (born in Oisterwijk near 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, in 1507; died 19 July 1578) was a Dutch Roman Catholic theologian and mystical writer.
Life.
After finishing his classical studies in the school of the Hieronymites, he studied philosophy, theology, and canon law at the Catholic University of Leuven, but refused to take his doctor's degree. In 1530 he was ordained priest, and then settled in Cologne in order to devote himself to higher studies and the practice of Christian perfection.
There he became the private tutor of a number of young men, mainly university students. Peter Canisius and Lawrence Surius are noted among his pupils. In Cologne, too, he made close friendships with several members of the Carthusian Order, among them Johann Landsberger, Gerhard Homontanus, and Theoderich and Bruno Loher. Though his health did not allow him to become a member of the order, he lived in the monastery, for a time at least, and followed its rule of life as closely as possible.
In 1538 Nicolaus was appointed pastor of the Béguinage at Diest; after a year he surrendered his charge for a time, but took it up again, with such success that after his death he was commonly spoken of as the saintly Father Eschius. He was also instrumental in founding several diocesan seminaries according to the rules laid down by the Council of Trent.

Bamford v Turnley (1860) 3 B & S 62; 122 ER 25, is an important English tort law case, concerning nuisance and what it means to be a reasonable user of land.
Facts.
The defendants burnt bricks in a kiln and this sent noxious fumes to the surrounding country, affecting various neighbours. It made them and their servants ill. They sued to prevent the nuisance.
At first instance it was held that the brick smoke was reasonable because the defendant had only been using the kiln in order to build a home.

Bramwell B held that the defendants had to pay compensation. Responding to the argument that if land is being reasonably used in itself, then there is a public interest that it should be carried on Bramwell B went on…

CISF conflict at Bokaro

A Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) Association conflict took place at Bokaro, India on 27 June, 1979.
The members of the GREAT CISF Unit at Bokaro had formed an all-India association in March 1979 and Sadanand Jha, was elected as its General Secretary. Thereafter, a country wide agitation was carried on for recognition of the said association. In June 1979 some of the members of the said association were called upon to meet the Home Minister at Delhi. A delegation of the said association went to Delhi. While there ; they staged a demonstration. Some of the demonstrators, including Sadanand Jha, were arrested,but subsequently released on bail. At Bokaro Steel Plant, the agitation which was going on and the situation aggravated from 27 May, 1979. 
Whereas a large group of members of CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Ltd, Bokaro took out processions and raised slogans such as "INQULAB ZINDABAD", "VARDI VARDI VARDI BHAI BHAI LARKE LENGE PAI PAI", "JO HAMSE TAKRAYEGE CHOOR CHOOR HO JAYEGA" and "PUNJAB KI JEET HAMARI HAI AAB CISF KI BARI HAI",participating in the gherao of Supervisory Officers, participating hunger strike and 'dharna' near the Quarter Guard and Administrative Building of CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Ltd. since 27 May 1979 in violation of the provisions of CISF Act,1968.
Out of 1900 persons belonging to CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro about 1000 persons participated in the processions and violent demonstrations.The said agitation and the violent activity reached a very serious proportion in the last week of June, 1979 with the result that Army had to be called by the State Authorities on 23.6.1979, so as to restore normalcy in the area. The State Government had also deployed 9 Magistrates to assist the Army authorities as also the CRPF for restoring the normal conditions at the Bokaro Steel Plant.
On 24.6.1979, on seeing the arrival of the Army, the agitators started making preparations for armed resistance by putting up sand bags, flood lights and barricades in the CISF Lines.They had gained the control of CISF Lines and the Officers were not allowed to have any access to the Lines or to other ranks of CISF.
On 25.6.1979, the Army along with 9 Magistrates took up positions round the CISF Lines in the early hours and called upon the agitators to give up charge of the Armory. In spite of giving repeated warnings by the authorities to give up charge of the Armory, the agitators did not give up arms, but, instead, resorted to violence. The agitators started firing at 0320 hours at the Army. The Army returned the fire. The said exchange of fire continued for 3 hours before the Army could spell out the violent retaliation of the agitators. The said violent exchange of fire resulted in the instant death of one Army Major and 2 more Army personnel were also killed as a result of firing by the CISF personnel.It may also be stated that there were 22/29 deaths in the course of the said pitched battle, which went on for three hours between the violent armed agitators and the Army.

USS Manhasset (AG-47)

USS "Manhasset" (AG-47/YAG-8) – later known as USCGC "Manhasset" (WIX-276) – was a commercial cargo ship leased by the U.S. Navy during World War II. She was armed with guns and depth charges and was used as a weather patrol ship, a convoy escort, and as a patrol craft. She experienced action in the dangerous North Atlantic Ocean, but returned home safely after war's end.
Constructed in Maryland.
"Manhasset" (AG 47) was built by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Sparrows Point, Maryland, in 1923 as merchantman "Wilton"; acquired by the U.S. Maritime Commission from her owner, Eastern Steamship Lines, Inc., in 1941; transferred under time charter to the Navy 2 January 1942; renamed "Manhasset" and reclassified from "YAG-8" to "AG-47" on 30 May 1942; converted for use as a weather patrol ship by Sullivan Drydock and Repair Corp., Brooklyn, New York; and loaned to the U.S. Coast Guard and commissioned 8 August 1942, Lt. Comdr. P. L. Stinson, USCG, in command.
World War II operations.
Equipped with specialized meteorological instruments, "Manhasset" joined the weather patrol in the North Atlantic Ocean to gather vital weather information used in compiling forecasts for Allied European operations against the Axis. She braved the dangers of stormy seas and the menace of German U-boats while operating her assigned and isolated patrol areas out of Argentia, Newfoundland, and Boston, Massachusetts. She averaged about one patrol a month, usually about three weeks long.
"Manhasset" also patrolled and searched for German submarines. While cruising midway between Flemish Cap and Cape Farewell, Greenland, she depth charged a suspected U-boat, with no positive results, 27 April 1943. The following week convoy ONI-5 steamed through her patrol station, and on 5 May she provided support during one of the most savage convoy battles of World War II.
The slow 43 ship convoy was attacked by U-boats between late 4 May and early 6 May. Although the convoy lost 13 ships during the hazardous passage from the United Kingdom to New York City, courageous escorts sank five submarines and repulsed the remainder. Never again did German submarines attack in such force.
As "Manhasset" patrolled near the British merchant ship "Dolius", torpedoed and abandoned earlier in the day but still afloat, she made sound contact with a submarine late in the afternoon. She made six vigorous depth charge attacks and sighted first a periscope wake followed by an oil slick. However, she sighted no wreckage and broke off attack to guard the torpedoed ship after more than 2 hours of searching.
Transferred to the Coast Guard.
"Manhasset" contained her weather station patrols during the rest of the war. The Navy transferred her to the U.S. Coast Guard 22 October 1943, and her name was struck from the Navy List 30 October 1943.
Post-war dispositioning.
On 15 October 1945 she was decommissioned by the Coast Guard, and, on 16 October 1946, she was sold. Her subsequent fate is not known.
My father, Edgar Warren Stevanus USN was one of four weathermen on the Manhasset the last 18 or so months of the war. He was the only Navy person on an otherwise all Coast Guard crew. The weathermen worked in 2's, 12 hours on and 12 hours off seven days a week. Edgar Stevanus is a retired Postmaster and lives in Sugarcreek, Ohio.

Donald Barkly Molteno

Donald Barkly Molteno (1908-1972), known as "Dilizintaba" ("He who removes mountains"), was a South African parliamentarian, constitutional lawyer, champion of civil rights and a prominent opponent of Apartheid.
Early life and legal career.
He was born on 13 February 1908 in Cape Town, in the then Cape Province of South Africa, into a family with a long tradition of political involvement and public service in the Cape (His grandfather, Sir John Molteno was its first Prime Minister).
He attended Diocesan College and Cambridge University, where he graduated in 1930 with Honours in Law and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple. After practising law for a time in London, he returned to South Africa in 1932 and was admitted as an advocate to the Bar of the Cape Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. He was made a Q.C. in 1952 and practised at the Cape Bar until 1964.
He was also President of the Cape Bar Council from 1961 to 1963.
Political career.
Molteno was involved in anti-Apartheid politics from a young age. In 1937 he was approached by the ANC, who asked him to represent them in the House of Assembly. He was elected a Member of Parliament at the age of 29, representing the Western Cape constituency for 11 years until 1948. 
During this time he was an exceptionally prominent and active MP in the opposition. He was a member of the Civil Rights League, Cafda and the Cape Joint Council of Europeans and Bantu. He was also the regional representative on the South African Institute of Race Relations in the Western Cape in 1936, and was its president from 1958 to 1960. 
It was partly due to his fight against the segregationalist policies of J. B. M. Hertzog that he acquired the nickname "Dilizintaba" ("Remover of mountains"). 
He went on to become the first chairman of the Liberal Party of South Africa's constitutional committee before he joined the Progressive Party (South Africa) and became chairman of its constitutional policy commission as well. He was also one of the Counsel engaged in the constitutional cases questioning the powers of the Union Parliament of South Africa after the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.
Academic career and later life.
Mr Molteno was a member of the University of Cape Town Council (from 1951 to 1960) as well as a part-time lecturer in Constitutional and Administrative Law at that institution. He lectured full-time at the "Department of Roman Dutch Law" from 1964, and in 1967 was appointed Professor of the newly created "Department of Public Law".
Molteno was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Law in 1970 - a position he held until his death in 1972. 
He left two children by his first wife Veronica Strömsöe and three by his second wife Mary Fleet Goldsmith.
He appears as a character in the novel 'Ah, but Your Land is Beautiful' by his colleague and contemporary Alan Paton.

Horus Heresy (novels)

The Horus Heresy is an  series of science fantasy books written by various authors. The series takes place during the Horus Heresy, a fictional galaxy-spanning civil war occurring 10,000 years prior to the far future setting of Games Workshop's "Warhammer 40,000" tabletop miniatures wargame. The war is described as a major contributing factor to the game's dystopian environment.
The books are published in several media by the Black Library, a Games Workshop division, with the first title released in April 2006; the work consisted of 25 published volumes, with more in the pipeline.
The series has developed into a distinct and successful product line for the Black Library; titles have often appeared in bestseller lists, and overall the work has received critical approval despite reservations. It is an established, definitive component of Game Workshop's "Horus Heresy" sub-brand, and authoritative source material for the entire Warhammer  shared universe and its continuing development.
Overview.
"The Horus Heresy" is a dark, far future military space opera that takes place during the Horus Heresy, a cornerstone event of the dystopian science fantasy "Warhammer 40,000" universe. The Horus Heresy is presented as a major chapter of conflict in the "Warhammer 40,000" lore: it is caused by a Chaos plot to foil the Emperor by fomenting rebellion and internecine warfare in the expanding Imperium of Man.
The shared universe was originally created in 1987 by Games Workshop, parent company of series publisher Black Library, as the campaign setting for the "Warhammer 40,000" tabletop miniatures wargame and in 2006 Black Library began publishing "The Horus Heresy" series. The series consists of full-length novels, and novel-length compilations of novellas or short stories, written by a number of authors. The series includes new characters as well as establishing the background of previously-established "Warhammer 40,000" characters who play an important role in the post-Heresy fictional universe.
The first three novels in "The Horus Heresy" are an opening book trilogy. This trilogy presents some of the background and causes of the Heresy, and describes the start of the conflict. The arc's focus is on Warmaster Horus, the principal antagonist, and covers about two years in the overall Heresy timeline; most of this period elapses before the rebellion begins. Following the trilogy, the narrative is not strictly sequential and is often presented in nonlinear fashion from book to book. Apart from the initial trilogy, the stories often concern events that happen earlier or later than their position in the series would suggest, or may include time periods already covered in other series titles.
The majority of stories in "The Horus Heresy" are set around the start of the fictional universe's 31st millennium, in contrast to most "Warhammer 40,000" material, which takes place in the 41st millennium. The stories in "The Horus Heresy" routinely cover the conflict's background, with some going back centuries before the war (and the 31st millennium) begins. In narrower scope, the entire conflict (including the Heresy proper and its proximate formative period), is depicted as having lasted less than a decade. With few exceptions, the sequence and dating of Heresy events is implied rather than stated in "The Horus Heresy" stories.

Synopsis.
Story setting.
Early in the Milky Way is in the throes of the . Originating from Terra (Earth), it is an interstellar crusade that claims the galaxy as the rightful domain of Humankind, and aims to reunite the multitude of scattered human space colonies under an "Imperium of Man". Organised in numerous , the Crusade fields huge fleets and vast armies; at its forefront, led by the Primarchs, are Legions of Space Marines transhuman super-warriors numbering in the millions. Over the course of two Terran centuries, the Crusade has reached star systems more than 50,000 light years away from its original staging point in the Sol (Solar) System, has assimilated millions of worlds into the Imperium, and has given Humankind a dominant position among the galaxy's species. Its grand mastermind is the "Emperor of Mankind", a mysterious superhuman of unknown origin who is said to be almost when the Crusade starts.
The Emperor, Founder and Head of the Imperium, is a being of literally towering charisma, prowess, conviction, and ability. He has declared an atheistic worldview the based on science, reason, and human primacy. However, he is also the most powerful human (or humanlike) , and overall, one of the most formidable psychics in the galaxy; the Imperial Truth is at best a misrepresentation. The Emperor knows that in the , the dark matter/dark energy-like parallel dimension that is the domain of thought, emotion, and consciousness, exist sentient vortices of concentrated, harmful energy. These malign immaterial entities forever seek to breach the material universe and subjugate or consume all life within it. They are the basis of many human and alien religions, and are known (by the few humans aware of their existence) collectively as Chaos (Warhammer), the , or the .
Humankind's continuing biological and psycho-spiritual evolution includes the gradual development of widespread Warp-related psychic abilities that will make the species far more susceptible to Chaotic influence; united under the Imperium of Man, shielded in the belief of Imperial Truth, and judiciously steered by the Emperor and his inner circle, the human race may yet avoid the Chaos-induced psychic corrosion and social entropy that would lead to its eventual annihilation. The transition of Humankind to a spiritually conscious species that is self-determining, and free of taint, may thus be accomplished. Chaos is aware of the Emperor's objectives; it has plans of its own to thwart them.
Book 1 to Book 10.
1. Horus Rising: the seeds of Heresy are sown
"Horus Rising", the series opener, starts its real time narrative in the early years of the 31st millennium, during of the Great Crusade. It describes the rise to power of Horus Lupercal, Primarch of the "Luna Wolves" Legion of Space Marines (the 16th Legion of 20 formed originally), and the most versatile and favoured "son" of the Emperor. The Emperor has recently appointed him Warmaster (overall commander of Imperial military forces) and has left him in charge of the Crusade; he then returns to Terra, where in relative isolation is undertaking a secret project that even Horus is not privy to. Much of the focus of this novel is on Garviel Loken, Captain of the Luna Wolves' 10th Company. He becomes a member of the (an informal advisory body to Horus), and participates in Crusade campaigns against anti-Imperials and aliens. The story also hints at tensions in the nascent Imperium, exacerbated by the Emperor's absence and actions these are common themes in following books.
2. False Gods: the Heresy takes root
"False Gods" picks up the tale a few weeks after the conclusion of Book 1 in the series timeline, and tells the story of Horus' fall. In a complicated conspiracy implemented by Chaos allies, Horus is mortally wounded during a Crusade mission by an alien, Chaos-tainted weapon. In a desperate (and contrary to Imperial doctrine) action by his lieutenants to ensure his survival, he is taken to a temple that has a reputation for healing. However the temple is actually in service to Chaos, and both Horus' wound and its supposed healing makes him susceptible to Chaos' influence. He ultimately turns against his "father", the Emperor, and sets in motion the entire Heresy. This novel further highlights the institutional and personal tensions that accompany the Imperium's maturity into the preeminent power of the galaxy; they include rifts among Primarchs and among (and within) Legions. The tensions, and characters' flaws, are repeatedly and successfully manipulated by Chaos in this and following volumes. A parallel storyline, also present in several other books, involves the growing influence within Crusade Expeditions and in the wider Imperium of a forbidden religious cult, whose members worship the Emperor as god.
3. Galaxy in Flames: the Heresy revealed
"Galaxy in Flames" continues the Heresy story, starting timewise shortly after the end of "False Gods". It outlines the corrupted Warmaster's descent into madness, which will soon engender a brutal galaxy-wide civil war that abruptly ends the Great Crusade and subverts its objectives and ideals. Horus continues his secret planning of the rebellion in earnest, seeking (and finding) allies among the Primarchs, their Legions, and the Imperium's other organisations and personalities. The novel details the first open move of the Heresy, the culling of remaining "Loyalists" from the ranks of "Traitor" Legions and other rebel forces. This mainly takes place in the (fictional) star system, specifically on and around the planet Isstvan III; Loyalist vessels come under treacherous rebel fire in the surrounding space, while on the planet's surface pro-Emperor elements of several rebel Space Marine Legions and Imperial Army units defiantly oppose the traitors.
4. The Flight of the Eisenstein: the Heresy unfolds
"The Flight of the Eisenstein" follows the "Eisenstein", a space frigate of the "Death Guard" or 14th Legion, commanded by Battle‑Captain Nathaniel Garro of the 7th Company one of the few Commanders in the Traitor Legions that remain loyal to the Emperor. The story describes "Eisenstein" escape from Isstvan III (see "Galaxy in Flames" above) and its perilous voyage across the galaxy as it attempts to reach Terra and raise the alarm over the developing rebellion. Garro and the others on board the vessel face suspicion and incredulity from Imperial authorities; apart from the inconceivable news of Horus' betrayal, the situation is complicated by the fact that many of the travellers on the "Eisenstein" now openly proclaim their heretical belief in the Emperor's divinity.
5. Fulgrim: visions of treachery
"Fulgrim" centers on the eponymous Primarch of the "Emperor's Children", as both the flamboyant, perfectionist Commander and his Space Marines become corrupted by Chaos around the time Horus meets the same fate (Book 2). As a result, a warning about Horus' imminent betrayal and the disaster that may follow delivered by the alien Eldar to Fulgrim and his staff goes unheeded. The Emperor's Children eventually become the "Chosen" of Slaanesh, a god of Chaos, while Fulgrim is slowly and unwittingly drawn into grotesque communion. Primarch Ferrus Manus and his "Iron Hands" Space Marines (the 10th Legion) also play a prominent role in the novel, and several other Primarchs and Legions make appearances. Described in passing is the pivotal Battle of Isstvan V (an Isstvan system planet), also known as the . The battle fully reveals the scale and ferocity of the rebellion.
6. Descent of Angels: loyalty and honour
"Descent of Angels" is a pre-Heresy story that concludes about 50 years before the start of that conflict. It introduces the "Dark Angels" Space Marines (the 1st Legion) and their Primarch, Lion El'Jonson. The story is mainly told from the point of view of Zahariel El'Zurias, a native of (a "Warhammer 40,000" planet). Caliban is an isolated, low-technology planet that resembles a medieval fantasy world; the narrative details the fantasy-like setting, uniquely diverging from the series norm. Zahariel is introduced in the story as an Aspirant of the Order, an organisation of techno-barbarian knights. The first half of the novel is set on Caliban and covers the final battles of the Order under the leadership of Jonson, the future Primarch. The book's second half describes Caliban's unification with the Imperium of Man as well as the actions of the Dark Angels during the early years of the Great Crusade. In this part of the story, Zahariel, selected as candidate Space Marine, is accepted as a Dark Angel wikt:neophyte#Noun. A future schism within the Legion is also intimated in this section of the book.
7. Legion: secrets and lies
"Legion" features the "Alpha" Legion of Space Marines, to be formed. It is the most secretive, subtle, and inscrutable of all Legions; its deepest secret is the binary nature of its Primarch, who comprises the twins Alpharius and Omegon. The book also highlights the Imperium's mainstream military force, the Imperial Army, featuring several male and female officers and their units. Another important factor in the novel is , a mysterious, ancient interspecies organisation opposed to Chaos one of the main characters is a human Cabal operative, John Grammaticus. The story takes place over roughly a 6‑month period, about two years before the Heresy starts; it describes the events that eventually lead Alpharius Omegon to support Horus.
8. Battle for the Abyss: my brother, my enemy
"Battle for the Abyss" is concerned with the lead‑up to the rebels' invasion of , the in‑universe remote home star system of the unshakably Loyalist 13th Legion, the "Ultramarines" (Book 19 and 24). Early in the Heresy, the Traitor Word Bearers Legion is tasked with organising and leading the invasion; they plan to use an immense, secretly commissioned warship, the , to spearhead the surprise attack. The vessel, commanded by Fleet Captain Zadkiel, launches from shipyards near Jupiter around the time of the events on Isstvan III (Book 3), and sets course for Macragge, Ultramar's capital world. Leading the cast of Loyalist protagonists is Cestus, Fleet Commander and Captain of the 7th Company of the Ultramarines. They become aware of the powerful capital ship's true purpose, and engage in long pursuit; they will seek to prevent the "Furious Abyss" from participating in the invasion and from reaching Macragge.
9. Mechanicum: war comes to Mars
"Mechanicum" is the first book in the series not to focus on Primarchs or Space Marines. Instead, it is about the civil war on Mars, which takes place around the time of the start of the wider Heresy conflict. The planet is the seat of the Mechanicum, a cultlike, Terra-allied technocracy responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of all Imperial military and civilian technology. Planning his imminent campaign against the Imperium, Horus obtains the secret allegiance of highly placed Mechanicum Adepts, including that of Kelbor-Hal, Fabricator General of Mars and the technocracy's leader. They plot, and eventually carry out, a coup d'état in order to eliminate those on Mars who are loyal to the alliance with Terra and the Emperor. The ensuing war will determine which side in the struggle will receive the Mechanicum's crucial support.
10. Tales of Heresy
"Tales of Heresy" is a collection of short stories that introduces or expands storyline perspectives and actors such as the (the Praetorian Guard-like Imperial Bodyguard) and the , a classified Imperial organisation of warrior‑nuns originally introduced in Book 4; most stories take place around the time of the Heresy. It includes two stories that take place on Terra, one of which is happening much earlier than the Heresy and adds to the background regarding the Imperial Truth; another entry in the compilation is a Primarch origin story, wherein Angron (one of the Emperor's "sons") takes command of the the "World Eaters". The book contains seven stories by various authors; several stories relate to full-length novels in the series.
Book 11 to Book 20.
11. Fallen Angels: deceit and betrayal
"Fallen Angels" continues the Dark Angels tale begun in Book 6, "Descent of Angels". The novel starts around the time of Book 6's conclusion, about 50 years before the Heresy, but forwards to just about the time of the Heresy's beginning in the opening chapters. It tells two stories: one concerns the effort of Primarch Lion El'Jonson and a small group of Dark Angels to deny a (a planet devoted to manufacturing, especially of weapons) to Horus' forces; the other is the story of Luther (Lion El'Jonson's second), Zahariel El'Zurias (by now a full Space Marine), and a Dark Angels contingent sent back to Caliban, the Dark Angels Legion home world. They get involved in the fight against a growing insurgency that seeks to free the planet from under the Imperium's thumb.
12. A Thousand Sons: all is dust...
"A Thousand Sons" is the story of Primarch Magnus and the "Thousand Sons" Space Marines, the 15th Legion; it mainly takes place before the Heresy begins. Following a reprimand by the Emperor for dabbling in sorcery, Magnus and his Legion secretly continue to study the forbidden subjects. Then, around the time of Horus' corruption (Book 2), Magnus learns through sorcery of his brother's impending betrayal. He tries again through sorcery to warn the Emperor, believing that the gravity of the news justifies his disobedience. However, he overreaches with his powers and damages the vital and secret project the Emperor is undertaking (Book 1), endangering the safety of Terra itself in the process. The Emperor is enraged and orders Leman Russ, Primarch of the 6th Legion (the "Space Wolves"), to , the Thousand Sons Legion's in‑series home world. The Space Wolves, accompanied by other Imperial forces, are to bring Magnus and his Legion to Terra to account for themselves.
13. Nemesis: war within the shadows
"Nemesis" is set about two years after the events on Isstvan V described in Book 5, "Fulgrim". It is a look at the war behind the war, the covert operations undertaken by the opposing sides in order to influence the visible conflict. Specifically, it deals with a plan by a secret Imperial organisation, the , to eliminate Horus; an "Execution Force" consisting of operatives from all of the Officio's disciplines, and led by top-rated sniper Eristede Kell, is tasked with the mission. There have been several previous unsuccessful attempts against Horus' life, and this gives a high-ranking officer of the Traitor Word Bearers Legion the idea to field a nemesis weapon of his own: a highly specialised assassin, who is to be used in an audacious scheme to kill the Emperor.
14. The First Heretic: fall to Chaos
"The First Heretic" details the fall to Chaos of Primarch Lorgar and the the "Word Bearers". Decades before the start of the rebellion they become heretics relative to the Imperial Truth by introducing religious worship. This results in public and humiliating censure of Lorgar and the entire assembled Legion, by the Emperor himself. The despairing Lorgar is subsequently swayed by two of his most trusted lieutenants, who are in secret allegiance with Chaos; eventually both Primarch and Legion covertly embrace (and promote) the Primordial Truth, many years before Horus' corruption. The story is largely told from the point of view of Argel Tal, a Captain of the Word Bearers, who becomes commander of a Chaos-possessed elite Legion unit. It spans several decades, starting 43 years before the events on Isstvan V (Book 5) and concluding around the time the Word Bearers are on their way to assault Calth (Book 19).
15. Prospero Burns: the Wolves unleashed
"Prospero Burns" is part of the story arc of Book 12, however it follows a different but related timeline. The story begins more than a century before the Space Wolves-led mission to Prospero, and the concurrent start of the Heresy. It is presented from the point of view of Kasper Hawser, formerly a noted Terran academic who becomes a Crusade Remembrancer, and then the Oral Historian or of the 3rd Company of the Space Wolves Legion. On the surface it is his story; the important understory concerns the long-term machinations of Chaos, whose aim is the destruction of both Space Wolves and Thousand Sons. Chaos attempts to exploit the weaknesses of the Primarchs and their Legions in order to pit them against each other the ultimate result is the confrontation on Prospero. While this confrontation is taking place, Horus' previously covert rebellion becomes visible (Book 3). The novel also adds background to Horus' fall and to the planning of the Heresy campaign by Chaos and its forces.
16. Age of Darkness
"Age of Darkness" is a compilation of nine short stories by various authors. They take place during the seven‑year period between the Dropsite Massacre on Isstvan V (Book 5), and the conclusion of Horus' campaign. The stories present various facets of the unfolding conflict, as suspicion, insecurity, and paranoia spread through the galaxy on the wake of the Warmaster's betrayal. Subjects include: a Primarch prepares for the end of the Imperium; a Traitor PSYOP topples an Imperial planet; an unusual diplomatic contest will decide which side will be chosen by a world on the fence; a non-combatant may be a rebel agent or a herald of unpalatable truths for the Imperium; a Loyalist Space Marine in a Traitor Legion holds his own against his erstwhile brothers. Several of the included stories are linked through continuity; some are also prequels or sequels to stories in other series books.
17. The Outcast Dead: the truth lies within
"The Outcast Dead" is the first novel-length story in the series to take place almost entirely on Terra. It covers a relatively short period, starting several months before Magnus' catastrophic psychic visit at the Imperial Palace (Book 12), and concluding several months after this event. The unauthorised visit is central to the story: apart from damaging the Emperor's top secret project (Book 1) and the planet's defense, it massively disrupts Terra's long-range communications infrastructure. The ensuing isolation and confusion cause indecision and delays for the Loyalist side. The story's main character is Kai Zulane, previously a gifted Imperial Psyker#apath attached to the Ultramarines Legion. He unwittingly becomes the keeper of a secret that could decide the victor in the developing galactic civil war. The secret has additional implications regarding the Heresy's conclusion and the future course of the Imperium of Man. "The Outcast Dead" are other protagonists: a small, disparate group of Space Marines suspected as traitors, with whom Zulane falls in during the second half of the book.
18. Deliverance Lost: ghosts of Terra
"Deliverance Lost" is mainly concerned with the actions of Primarch Corvus Corax and his Space Marine Command, or "Raven Guard", during the year following the Dropsite Massacre (Book 5). However, operatives and the Primarch of the Alpha Legion play a prominent role. The story starts about 3 months after the Dropsite Massacre, with the unexpected rescue of Corax and the remnants of his Legion (at less than 5% strength due to casualties in that battle). Arriving at Terra a few months after the events described in "The Outcast Dead" take place, Corax convinces the Emperor to impart to him the knowledge and material that may accelerate the rebuilding of his Legion. The second part of the novel describes the effort to reconstitute the Raven Guard, undertaken on (its home world in "Warhammer 40,000" fiction), and the pursuit of opposite objectives by the Alpha Legion. The novel features the reappearance of The Cabal (Book 7), and of other well-known characters; it also adds information about the developing strategies and subterfuge applied by the opposing sides, including reasons for Horus' timetable and for the Emperor's actions during the initial stages of the Heresy.
19. Know No Fear: the battle of Calth
"Know No Fear" documents the rebels' surprise assault on Calth, an ascendant Ultramar system world. It is planned and led by the Traitor Word Bearers Legion, now fully and openly committed to the spread of the Primordial Truth. The narrative starts close to where the timelines of Book 8 and Book 14 converge (in their respective conclusions), with the invasion force en route to, or near the planet. The rebel mission has aims beyond just delivering a crippling blow to the Ultramarines Legion and their home system; its objectives may affect the entire Heresy campaign. The story tracks the Calth assault from its opening covert phases, and the actions of several characters. Unaware of the developing rebellion and the Word Bearers' true role and allegiance, Primarch Roboute Guilliman and his Ultramarines are unprepared for the underhand invasion: it is total, bloody war, with ritualistic undertones, scorched earth tactics, decisive use of technology, and the considerable involvement of Chaos; the inconceivable treachery and its implications forever change the Loyalists' view of reality.
20. The Primarchs
"The Primarchs" is a compilation of four novellas by different authors, each story starring one of the "sons" of the Emperor. The novellas further develop these characters, who make multiple appearances in the series: following the Dropsite Massacre (Book 5), Fulgrim, perversely empowered by his own corruption, reveals his true nature and future plans to top officers of his compromised Legion; during a Great Crusade campaign against the enigmatic Eldar, Ferrus Manus, already beset by unsettling dreams, is subjected by alien sorcerers to stark, portentous visions and warnings about his future and role in the soon to be revealed Heresy; with Horus' rebellion in full swing after the events of Isstvan V, a suspicious and isolated Lion El'Jonson accepts the newly revealed realities of the Warp and decides on an independent course of action for the Dark Angels in the unfolding conflict; around the same time, and plotting a typically indecipherable course in the expanding war, the twinned Primarch of the Alpha Legion is involved in a unique counterintelligence operation that extends the Legion's customary deceptions inwards.
Book 21 and above.
21. Fear to Tread: the Angel falls
"Fear to Tread" describes an operation by the forces of Chaos that is supposed to turn Primarch Sanguinius and the the "Blood Angels", to their cause. To succeed, Chaos plans to take advantage of a genetic flaw in Sanguinius' and the Legion's DNA. As the Heresy is getting under way, the outwardly still loyal Warmaster orders the entire 9th Legion and their unsuspecting Primarch to a remote star system. There they find themselves isolated and ambushed, fighting a new kind of war against Chaos entities and daemons designed to trigger the Legion's flaw. The plan almost succeeds; yet conflicting agendas among anti-Imperial protagonists, as well as the fortitude and unorthodox tactics of quick-to-adapt Blood Angels, narrowly result in Loyalist victory. In the meantime Horus' rebellion erupts openly and the Loyalists suffer catastrophic losses in the Dropsite Massacre (Book 5). Sanguinius and his Legion, now fully aware of the great betrayal and the reality of Chaos, race to the defense of Terra and the Emperor while buffeted by unprecedented navigational difficulties; it is hinted that these are related to the action in the Ultramar system of Calth (Books 19 and 24).
22. Shadows of Treachery
"Shadows of Treachery" is a compilation that collects five short stories previously published in limited editions, art books, or other formats, and also contains two new novellas. Most of the stories involve the respectively the Loyalist "Imperial Fists" and Traitor "Night Lords", and their Primarchs Rogal Dorn and Konrad Curze. Other Legions and Primarchs are also featured, while one short story takes place on Mars and illuminates an aspect of the Traitor Mechanicum's conspiracy. One of the novellas is mainly about an all-out close-quarters space battle, between a Loyalist sent to punish Horus following the events of Isstvan III (Book 3) and the Traitor fleet that ambushes it; the other new novella deals with the aftermath of another naval engagement in space that cripples the Night Lords Legion. The narratives of all stories fill gaps in the series or add further details about the Heresy and its actors; they cover periods that range from several decades before the conflict to around the time frame of Book 18 (one short story is a prequel to that novel).
23. Angel Exterminatus: flesh and iron
"Angel Exterminatus" covers a Traitor operation in uncharted and dangerous galactic space, that may purportedly decide the war in favour of the rebels. The story provides further glimpses of disparate motivations and conflicting objectives among traitor factions as the Heresy campaign continues. It is taking place some time after the Dropsite Massacre (Book 5), shortly following the events described by two novellas (Books 20 and 22). Featured are the 4th Legion of Space Marines, the "Iron Warriors", renowned siege masters of the Great Crusade, and their Primarch Perturabo. However the core plot is set in motion by Fulgrim and the Emperor's Children, who share the spotlight. The embittered Iron Warriors have aligned with Horus out of frustration with the ignominious and unheralded role assigned them by the Imperium; before the story begins, they lash out in unforgivable genocide. In the story, they are invited to the freelance operation (which is unknown to the Warmaster) by Fulgrim and his Legion, who have their own agenda. The operation's true goal is kept secret from Perturabo and his Space Marines, who come to realise that not all fellow rebels can be trusted. A side thread involves Fabius Bile, the chief medical officer of the Emperor's Children, and the Traitors' top geneticist; he is on a no-holds-barred quest to exceed the Emperor's genetic achievements.
24. Betrayer: blood for the Blood God
"Betrayer" returns the series to the action in the Ultramar theatre; it starts around the time the events of Book 19 begin to unfold. Unlike that story, "Betrayer" is presented from the perspective of the rebels, in this case the World Eaters and Word Bearers Legions, and often through the particular viewpoint of Khârn, Captain of the 8th Company of the World Eaters and Equerry to Primarch Angron. In tenuous and fragile cooperation, the two very different Traitor Legions lay waste to worlds across Ultramar; it is a "Shadow Crusade" meticulously planned by Primarch Lorgar of the Word Bearers, who deploys "Abyss"-class spaceships. The campaign's strategic goal is the destruction or isolation of the powerful Ultramarines Legion, its home star system, and the system's considerable resources; removing Ultramar as a factor in the war is one of Horus' primary objectives. The scheming Primarch of the Word Bearers orchestrates genocide in unprecedented scale, as a way to summon the powers of Chaos. With their help, he hopes to generate the so-called , an immense interdimensional disturbance that will create an impenetrable veil around Ultramar. As the final piece of his plan, Lorgar engineers the "ascension" into daemonhood of the increasingly unstable Angron: the event is to act as the conduit for the unnatural storm.
25. Mark of Calth
"Mark of Calth" is the fifth compilation to appear in the series; it contains seven short stories and one novella, each by a different author. The stories further describe aspects of the rebels' Ultramar campaign, as close prequels or sequels of Books 19 and 24. "Premium" editions and the e‑audiobook version were released April 2013; text-based general release editions were expected mid-to-late 2013.
26. Vulkan Lives
In the wake of the Dropsite Massacre at Isstvan V, the survivors of the Salamanders Legion searched long and hard for their fallen primarch, but to no avail. Little did they know that while Vulkan might have wished himself dead, he lives still. As the war continues without him, all eyes turn to Ultramar and Guilliman's new empire there, and Vulkan's sons are drawn into an insidious plot to end the Heresy by the most underhand means imaginable.
27. The Unremembered Empire
The unthinkable has happened - Terra has fallen to the traitor forces of Warmaster Horus! Nothing else could explain the sudden disappearance of the Astronomican's guiding light at the heart of the Imperium, or so Roboute Guilliman would believe. Ever the pragmatist, he has drawn all his forces to Ultramar and begun construction of the new empire known as Imperium Secundus. Even with many of his primarch brothers at his side, he still faces war from without and intrigue from within - with the best of intentions, were the full truth to be known it would likely damn them all as traitors for all eternity.
28. Scars
Of all the Legiones Astartes, the White Scars of Jaghatai Khan remain the most enigmatic and elusive. Born of a civilisation that prizes honour, speed and fearsome loyalty, their allegiance has yet remained unclear even as the galaxy is torn apart by Horus’s treachery, and both sides have apparently counted them among their potential allies in the war to come. But when the Alpha Legion launch an unexplained and simultaneous attack against the White Scars and Space Wolves, the Khan must decide once and for all whether he will stand with the Emperor or the Warmaster... or neither.
Media and editions.
Series titles are released in multiple versions: in print as paperbacks and hardcovers (with paperback editions printed in mass-market and trade formats); as e-books; and as either abridged or unabridged audiobooks and e‑audiobooks (respectively, in compact disc and audio file formats the Black Library has partnered with specialist UK company Heavy Entertainment for audio production).
, print editions were generally though some mass market versions have rendered in more; total series length in first paperback edition was about (24 titles). Digital editions ranged in size from less than a megabyte (some e‑book releases) to over a gigabyte (some e‑audiobook releases); the totals run from a low of about 10 MB (for titles, in EPUB format) to a high of about 11 GB (for 13 unabridged titles, in MP3 format). Durations of audio versions spread from about 6 hours for the abridged editions to anywhere between for the unabridged editions; the total length of the unabridged edition was about 168 hours, divided among 13 titles. CD audiobooks were published in packages of 5 discs per abridged title; two unabridged titles were available on CD, with the longest packaged in 13 discs.
Outside the UK, series titles are published in several countries and languages by Black Library divisions or as co-editions with local associates. , other-language renditions lagged the English-language series in the number of released titles, and had followed distinct publication schedules and release sequences. Also , editions in other languages were published in paperback and e‑book formats.
Starting November 2010, new titles have often been released simultaneously in multiple media; occasionally since then, new titles' digital or audio releases have preceded the print versions, in reverse of previous practice (see table "Published" above). Stories in series compilations have also been published individually, as e‑books, and as MP3 or CD "audio shorts".
Series stories have appeared in whole or in part in other Black Library publications, sometimes before the corresponding series books have become generally available; prepublications have included stand-alone releases of compilation stories. "Prerelease" copies of series volumes have been regularly offered months before official publication, in Games Workshop- and Black Library‑sponsored events such as the various Games Days.
There have been a number of special editions and bundles published in a variety of media; bundles have included the "Horus Heresy Collections", which mix editions and media of the same or different titles. In concert with established industry practice, certain special editions are available in limited distribution months before the release of the corresponding regular, or wider-release, versions.
The books' cover art has been separately released, in poster and other formats. Series bundles and special offers have also contained the separate artwork releases of the included titles.
"Premium" editions.
English-language series releases include publishing of the titles in special "premium" editions: "Premium Hardback" (print) and "Enhanced Ebook" (digital). These versions contain additional material and artwork, and are published several months before their general-availability or regular edition counterparts. The first title to appear in "premium" editions, in October 2012, was "Angel Exterminatus" (Book 23). The earlier catalogue of the series is also republished in these editions, again beginning October 2012 with the series-opening novel trilogy.
Reception.
Several novels in "The Horus Heresy" series have appeared in UK and US science fiction charts, have occupied high positions in Nielsen BookScan genre lists, and since early 2010 have often charted in The New York Times Bestseller List for mass-market paperbacks.
Critical reception of individual titles has been mixed, yet the general tone of reviews has been mostly positive. Although the series overall has been viewed favourably, there have been complaints about its length, the multitude of characters and narrative threads, and the timeline jumps or repetitions caused by the nonlinear storytelling. The evolving series is said to have gradually acquired a backstory and terminology of its own; this has led reviewers to question the accessibility of individual stories to new or casual readers.
Early in its publishing history, the series became a sales success in its category. "Horus Rising" by Dan Abnett, the opening title, set the pace shortly after its release, topping "Locus" magazine's "Locus Bestsellers: Gaming-Related" list of August 2006; practically every title in the series had achieved the same or similar performance on this chart. "Horus Rising"s January 2011 CD audiobook release also appeared in ranked sales lists: the (abridged) edition was number 15 in a related chart published by "The Bookseller", covering 2011 UK sales up to September.
"Legion" by Abnett, and "Battle for the Abyss" by Ben Counter, were listed in Nielsen BookScan's list of top‑20 fictional works by small publishers for the year ending on 23 August 2008; the books appeared in eighth and sixteenth place respectively. The next published title, "Mechanicum" by Graham McNeill, entered "The Bookseller"s "Top 20 Fiction Heatseekers" chart of 5 December 2008, shortly after its release, at number 10; series titles have consistently appeared in this list.
"A Thousand Sons" by McNeill was released in February 2010 and arrived at number 22 on The New York Times Bestseller List, the first ever novel on the Black Library imprint to do so. "Nemesis" by James Swallow followed, reaching number 26 on the List in August 2010. "The First Heretic", by Aaron Dembski‑Bowden, reached number 28 in the weekly chart in November 2010 and stayed on the List for a second week, at number 33. Abnett's "Prospero Burns" was next, reaching number 16 in January 2011; this title also topped a science fiction and fantasy book chart published by "The Times" (London) in March of the same year.
The compilation "Age of Darkness", edited by Christian Dunn, also entered The New York Times Best Sellers List, in May 2011, at number 31. Book 19, "Know No Fear", again by Abnett, continued the trend: it appeared at number 21 in March 2012. It was followed on the List by the next series title, "The Primarchs", a compilation edited by Dunn, which occupied position 29 during the week of 17 June 2012; in addition, "The Primarchs" had placed first in "Publishers Weekly" science fiction bestsellers listing for the week of 28 May 2012. In September 2012 "Fear to Tread" by Swallow entered The New York Times Best Sellers List at number 13, at the time the highest entry on that chart for a series novel; the book remained on the List the week after (week of 23 September), at number 33.
Related works.
Between the late–1980s introduction of the Horus Heresy and the start of this series publication in 2006, Games Workshop and affiliates released -branded products that expanded the concept's standing as "Warhammer 40,000" background material. The release of such works, which include literature independent of this series, continued ; the works may relate to it as prequels, sequels, or expansions of its stories.
Pre-series Horus Heresy literature and other related works may have been superseded or rendered obsolete, while other similar material may no longer be authoritative even as it remains in Horus Heresy and "Warhammer 40,000" canons; still other non-series Horus Heresy material has been eventually incorporated into the work.
A significant development was the 2012 initial release of the "Horus Heresy" miniatures wargame expansion, which repositioned the concept as a foreground element within the "Warhammer 40,000" gaming system while highlighting the importance of the Horus Heresy to Games Workshop's product lineup and the related universe. The expansion is reputedly developed in coordination with the book series, and includes new material and information about the Horus Heresy and the fictional universe; it joins the series and other works as an authoritative source of Heresy material and "Warhammer 40,000" background.
The Black Library and Games Workshop have released novels, game rulebooks, and other products not branded or classified as "Horus Heresy", yet directly relating to story arcs or events described in the series. An example is listed in the section below.

Charlotte Burgess

Charlotte Burgess (born on 25 January 1987 in Salford) is a British archer. She is part of the Olympic Team GB Archery team. At the age of 17 she emerged as one of the UK's best junior archers and came close to selection for the 2004 Summer Olympics.
On 11 January 2008, Burgess and her boyfriend – fellow archer Roy Nash – were attacked by a gang of about 25 teenagers. At the time, Burgess and Nash were practising at an indoor Archery Range, located within a Municipal Park in Cheadle, near Stockport, Greater Manchester. Nash attempted to stop the gang damaging his car - they forced him to the ground and began kicking him. Hearing the noise of a bottle being smashed, and fearing that the gang would use this as a weapon to injure Nash further, Burgess came outside and became involved in the incident. She suffered a bruised face and Nash's face and head were also bruised. They were treated for their injuries in Stepping Hill hospital. Burgess qualified for the European Indoor Championships just days later, on 13 January 2008. Her father said "I'm proud that despite her injuries, she succeeded among the top five women in the country – she was in the top three archers by 1.5 points".
2008 Summer Olympics.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Burgess finished her ranking round with a total of 623 points. This gave her the 40th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced 25th seed Guo Dan in the first round, beating the archer from China with 106-104. In the second round she was eliminated by team mate Naomi Folkard, 110-96
Together with Alison Williamson and Folkard, Burgess also took part in the team event. With her 623 score from the ranking round combined with the 651s of Folkard and Williamson the British team was in second position after the ranking round, which gave them a straight seed into the quarter finals. With 201-196 they were too strong for the Japanese team. In the semi final against China they scored 202 points with the Chinese scoring 208, missing out on the final. They were unable to recover in the bronze medal match and lost against France 203-201 to miss out on the medals.

Mayall's Object

Mayall's Object (also classified under the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 148) is the result of two colliding galaxies located 500 million light years away within the constellation of Ursa Major. It was discovered by Nicholas U. Mayall of the Lick Observatory on 13 March 1940, using the Crossley reflector. When first discovered, Mayall's Object was described as a peculiar nebula, shaped like a question mark. Originally theorized to represent a galaxy reacting with the intergalactic medium, it is now thought to represent the collision of two galaxies, resulting in a new object consisting of a ring-shaped galaxy with a tail emerging from it. It is thought that the original collision between the two original galaxies created a shockwave that initially drew matter into the center which then formed the ring.

Tweedmouth railway station

Tweedmouth railway station was a railway station which served the town of Tweedmouth area of Berwick-on-Tweed in Northumberland, England. It was located on the East Coast Main Line. As well as a railway station for passengers, it was also the main service yard and goods yard between Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh. Also Tweedmouth station was the terminus for the Tweed Valley Railway line (opened in 1849), which connected the East Coast Main Line with the Waverley Line at Newtown St. Boswells. The station lies to the south of the Royal Border Bridge.
It was opened on 29 March 1847 and initially was the terminus on the East Coast Main Line as the Royal Border Bridge was not yet complete, so trains could not pass over the River Tweed. Once the Royal Border Bridge had been completed in 1850 and opened by Queen Victoria, trains had an unbroken run from London to Edinburgh. 
The station closed on 15 June 1964 (along with the Kelso branch), a victim of the Beeching Axe. The station buildings were subsequently demolished but the platforms still survive, along with a number of engineers' sidings and a power signal box that supervises the main line from the Scottish border southwards towards Alnmouth.

Marilyn Roman

Marilyn Roman (born March 1936) is an American educator and Democratic Party politician who served as Acting Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. As City Council President, she became Acting Mayor succeeding Gerald McCann after his removal from office. Roman was the first woman to hold the office of mayor in the history of Jersey City.
Roman attended New Jersey City University earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education and a master's degree in urban education. She worked as a teacher and supervisor for the Jersey City Board of Education. Roman became involved in politics as a member of the Everett Terrace Block Association where she served as a representative attending City Council Meetings. At the urging of McCann, she was elected to the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1984 and served two terms. Running on McCann's ticket, Roman was elected to the city council in 1989.
Roman was director of the Education-Business Alliance of the Jersey City Board of Education and president of the City Council when McCann was removed from office following his conviction on Federal fraud charges. Roman continued to fill the vacancy when the city council failed to elect another candidate after 30 days. Roman served as mayor for four months until the city council reorganized and selected a new Council President.
Following the announced retirement of Congressman Frank J. Guarini, Roman organized and supported a slate of candidates in the 1992 Democratic Primary. She claimed to organize the ticket to support candidates for the Democratic County Committee farther down the ballot. Roman's candidates were opposed by a slate headed by State Senator Robert Menendez and supported by Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski. Menendez defeated Robert P. Haney by a ratio of 2-1, and Roman's candidates for Democratic County Committee only won one-third of the seats.
The City Council of Jersey City reorganized on July 1, 1992 and selected Joseph Rakowski as the new president. Rakowski also became acting mayor and the third mayor in that year. Roman retained her seat on the city council and completed her term. She ran to fill the remainder of the unexpired term in the special election, but came in third out of a field of nineteen candidates.

Peter Kastner

Peter Kastner (1 October 1943 – 18 September 2008) was a Canadian-born actor who achieved prominence as a disaffected youth in movies of the 1960s.
Kastner's first leading role was in the 1964 Canadian film "Nobody Waved Goodbye", which was a semi-improvised, documentary-style look at middle-class teenagers. He played an alienated young man, the son of a prosperous automobile dealer, who drifts into petty thievery.
His breakthrough role was in the title role of the 1967 Francis Ford Coppola comedy "You're a Big Boy Now", also starring Rip Torn, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman. Kastner played an earnest young man who travels to New York City and meets eccentrics. He played a similar role as a young, earnest advertising man swept up in the era in "B.S. I Love You."
Kastner also starred in the 1968–1969 ABC sitcom "The Ugliest Girl in Town", where he played Timothy Blair, a man who dressed in drag as a favour to his photographer brother. It was following "Ugliest Girl" that Kastner's fortunes declined. Unable to gain leading roles, he took supporting roles in movies and television series. He did star though in the 1977 CBC Television sitcom "Custard Pie" as Leo Strauss, the manager of a musical group of that name, but the series was not popular or critically well received. His last film role was in "Unfinished Business" (1984), a sequel to "Nobody Waved Goodbye".
Kastner died from a heart attack in Toronto on 18 September 2008, two weeks before his 65th birthday. He was survived by his second wife, Jenny.

Beefsteak Raid

The Beefsteak Raid was a Confederate cavalry raid that took place in September 1864 as part of the Siege of Petersburg during the American Civil War. Confederate Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton led a force of 3,000 troopers on what was to become a ride to acquire cattle that were intended for the consumption of the Union Army (which was laying siege to Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia).
Background.
Always lacking in supplies, the Confederate forces that were defending the capital of Richmond were beginning to run out of food. A report by General Robert E. Lee on August 22, 1864, stated that corn to feed the Southern soldiers was exhausted. A scout, Sergeant George D. Shadburne, informed General Hampton on September 5, 1864, that there were 3,000 cattle behind Union lines, at Edmund Ruffin's plantation on Coggin's Point, five miles (8 km) away from Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's headquarters, which were lightly defended by only 120 Union soldiers and thirty civilians. Sensing an opportunity to increase the army's food stores, Hampton arranged for 3,000 troops to follow him. Some of these men included "several certified Texas cattle thieves".
Raid.
Hampton led his men to the south of the cities, behind Union lines, on September 14. He chose to cross where the Cook's Bridge over the Blackwater River once stood, knowing that an attack from there would be unexpected. He had some engineers reconstruct the bridge. At 5 a.m. on September 16, Hampton's force attacked with a three-prong strike, with the center directed toward the cattle. Hampton's force captured more than 2,000 cattle, along with 11 wagons and 304 prisoners, leading them back to the Confederate lines at 9 a.m. on September 17.
Aftermath.
The total losses for the Confederates, who saw some opposition, were 10 killed, 47 wounded, and 4 missing. The official count of cattle successfully reaching the Confederates for food was 2,468.
Despite the raid's success, its strategic impact was not as great as the large number of cattle taken might seem to indicate. For whereas the Union had the resources to replace its lost cattle, the Confederates lacked grain to spare for feed. They were therefore forced to slaughter the cattle almost as soon as they had secured them. The ensuing "feast" on the Confederate side might be better described as a rush to consume the beef before it spoiled.
For days afterwards, the southerners would taunt the northern sentries, thanking them for all the food and inviting them over for dinner. There was so much beef available that Confederate sentries would sometimes offer it in unauthorized trades with Union sentries for certain luxury items of which the Federal soldiers had a plentiful supply, but the Confederates lacked. After the beef was eaten or spoiled, the Confederates reverted to their previous, dire food situation.
Abraham Lincoln called the raid "the slickest piece of cattle-stealing" he ever heard of. General Lee's adjutant Walter H. Taylor said it made up for the loss of the Weldon Railroad, a claim most historians consider to be overstated.
A fictionalized depiction of the raid is featured in the 1966 film "Alvarez Kelly".
The Prince George County Historical Society holds an annual steak dinner on the anniversary of the Beefsteak raid to commemorate the event.

Tioda

Tioda was a prominent Asturian architect of the 9th century. He worked primarily in Oviedo, where he constructed the church of San Salvador which was later elevated to the rank of cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oviedo and the Royal Palace. 
His work was recognised and praised by the kings Alfonso II of Asturias and Ramiro I of Asturias and he was paid by the court to design further buildings. The reconstruction of the San Julián de los Prados was ordered by Alfonso II of Asturias around 830 by Tioda. It is considered one of the greatest works of Asturian art and Asturian architecture and was declared a Historical-Artistic Monument by the Spanish Ministry of Culture in June 1917 and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 2 December 1998.
He has been called Spains first "urbanist". Due to his unusual name, in the past it was suggested that he might have originated from Aachen.

Seliana

Seliana () also known as Phelloe () is a village in the municipal unit of Aigeira, in the eastern part of Achaea, north Peloponnese, Greece. The village is built at an altitude of ~750 m on the foothills of the fir forest of Sarantapikho and on the eastern slope of the valley of river Krios. The village had a population of 52 in 2011. Aigeira is 10 km to the north, and Kalavryta is 21 km to the west. Seliana is connected by a 19 km road that leads to the town of Aegeira and the Greek National Road 8A, Athens - Corinth - Aigeira - Patras.
History.
The village of Seliana coincides with ancient Phelloe a small town of ancient Greece described in Pausanias book "Description of Greece - Achaea". Excavations in the broader area of Seliana have been conducted by the Austrian Archaeological Institute, the Italian School of Archaeology at Athens, the University of Salerno and the Greek Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities. In the village there are few remnants of ancient Phelloe in different places but the most notable are those beside the old chapel of St. Basil where there is still an ongoing excavation. 
There is a strong relation between the village of Seliana and the village of Selianitika. According to historian A. Fotopoulos the inhabitants of Seliana descended from the mountains to the coastal region of "Kryovrysi" near Aigio (where the village of Selianitika lies today) during the Ottoman period. Initially the residents of Seliana were spending the winter in Selianitika and the summer in their village of Seliana but later they settled permanently. The residents of Seliana carried with them the parish of Saint Basil (the oldest of Seliana's churches) and today Saint Basil is the patron saint of the village of Selianitika.

Georgia Cayvan

Georgie Eva Cayvan (August 22, 1857 – November 19, 1906) was a popular stage actress in the United States in the later part of the nineteenth century.
Early life.
Georgia Cayvan was born at Bath, Maine. She attended and graduated from the Boston School of Oratory. She initially earned a living as a professional fortune teller. She had insight into how to play out stage drama and brought her characters to fruition with her humor and expressive eyes.
Career.
Cayvan in 1879 accepted her first job on stage as Hebe in H.M.S. Pinafore with the Boston Ideal Opera Company. She was a member of the Union Square Company. She appeared in "Hazel Kirke" at the Madison Square Theatre in New York City in 1881. She played the part of Dolly Dutton. In 1881 she played the heroine part in a road company in such comedies and dramas as "The Professor" (1881); "The White Slave" (1882); "Siberia" (1883); "May Blossom" (1884); "The Wife" (1887); "The Charity Ball" (1889); and "Squire Kate" (1892). She then appeared in "Oedipus Tyrannus" at the Boston Theater.
Cayvan also acted at Booth's Theatre in New York City. She performed at the Fourteenth Street Theatre in "The White Slave" and Laura in "The Romany Rye." She also played Marcelle in "A Parisian Romance" in the Union Square Company. Cayvan was successful in the leading part of David Belasco’s "La Belle Russe." She was also a short time with Dion Boucicault.
In 1893 Cayvan became the first person to wear a glass dress. The dress was too brittle to be practical however. It was exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition in The Chicago's World's Fair of 1893. An article in the New York Times of July 28, 1893, predicted that glass dresses would become a fashion "fad." It points out that the first dress was made for Cayvan for her performance in "American Abroad." It was made by the Libbey Glass Company. Author Amelia Ransome Neville in her book gave an account of seeing Cayvan wear the fiberglass dress made by Edward Drummond Libbey. She points out that Cayvan wore it in "The Charity Ball".
In 1886 Cayvan contracted with Daniel Frohman, becoming the star of the Lyceum Theater in New York. Cayvan toured with her own company (which included Lionel Barrymore) starting in 1896. She was involved in a difficult divorce case in 1896 as being the other woman. She was, however, totally exonerated after defending herself. Cayvan received much support from several women's groups.
Later life and death.
After an operation in 1892 her health began to fail. In 1900 her poor health forced her to retire to the Sandford Sanitarium in Flushing, New York. There she died in 1906, aged 49, after an illness. She is buried at Newton Cemetery, Newton Massachusetts.

Toronto propane explosion

The Toronto propane explosion (also known as the Sunrise Propane incident) was a series of explosions and ensuing fire that took place on the morning of August 10, 2008, in the Downsview community of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The explosions occurred at the Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases propane facility in the Keele Street and Wilson Avenue area of North York around 03:50 ET. The blasts caused thousands of people to be evacuated from their homes and cost C$1.8 million to clean up, half of which was paid by the province of Ontario. An employee of Sunrise died in the initial explosions and a firefighter died of cardiac arrest the next day while at the scene.
History.
Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases was a company that sold propane for commercial and home purposes, in addition to other gases like helium and acetylene. The company has operated under a number of names since at least 1999. In 2002, a company named Sunrise Petroleum was successfully sued by First Choice Petroleum Inc., an oil and lubricants supplier, that claimed the company owed them C$54,063.73 in products and that Sunrise forged a document to avoid settling their account. In that case, it was found that Sunrise had forged the signature of a First Choice employee named Thomas Tims in a 1999 document, which stated Sunrise Petroleum would be taken over by a new company called Sunrise Petroleum Lubricants, and that Sunrise Petroleum would thereby not be responsible for any outstanding, unpaid, or unsettled accounts. However, Tims would not have signed the document because he was listed on it as "Tim Toms", rather than Tom Tims. As a result of the case, Sunrise was forced to pay the account owed plus interest, totalling C$93,389.54, and an additional C$34,284.71 in legal fees. Court documents also revealed a third name, Sunrise Propane & Petroleum, that the company had previously used.
An Ontario corporate profile states the facility was incorporated in 2004, though a Sunrise corporate solicitor and spokesperson is uncertain how long the facility was in operation. The facility was built in a residential neighbourhood in the North York area of Toronto. Toronto mayor David Miller stated that the facility was allowed to be built in the neighbourhood under zoning that was in place for over a decade.
The facility had previously been warned by Ontario's Technical Standards and Safety Authority for its lack of safety by not stopping truck-to-truck transfers at the company's facilities. During the investigation following the explosions, investigators found that truck-to-truck transfers were common at the facility. Truck-to-truck transfers are prohibited in Ontario because they increase the risk of a gas leak or a fire.
Incident.
At approximately 03:50 ET on the morning of August 10, 2008, a large explosion occurred at Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases, located near Murray Road and Spalding Road. This was followed by a series of explosions which sent large fireballs and clouds of smoke billowing into the sky. Large pieces of metal from the exploding propane tanks were ejected onto nearby streets and properties. Many homes and offices were damaged, windows were shattered, and doors were ripped from their hinges. About 200 firefighters battled the five-alarm fire that resulted from the explosions.
The threat of further blasts and concerns about the air quality forced the police to conduct a voluntary evacuation of a large area in the surrounding community. Residents living within a radius were told to leave their homes in the early hours of the morning. Toronto Transit Commission buses were used to evacuate them to Downsview Park and then to York University.
The explosions rocked the area and also caused the closure of part of Highway 401, between highways 404 and 400, for over 12 hours. Emergency crews feared another major explosion as two rail tankers continued to burn more than five hours after the initial explosion. Regular commercial air traffic was allowed to continue in and out of Pearson International Airport while smaller, privately owned aircraft were restricted from flying over the area.
Six people were sent to the hospital, 18 people admitted themselves to emergency clinics, and Emergency Medical Services treated 40 people on the site. During the course of the emergency response to the scene, a Toronto firefighter was found lifeless by emergency crews. Paramedics and firefighters tried to revive him but were unsuccessful. He was then rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The firefighter was identified as Bob Leek, a 55-year-old district chief of emergency planning and a 25-year veteran. Leek, who was off duty that night, had stopped to observe the activities of his colleagues. He just happened to have had a heart attack at that time. Sunrise employee Parminder Saini was unaccounted for. On August 11, a body was found at the scene. On September 3, the body was confirmed to be that of Saini.
Cause and investigation.
The Ontario Fire Marshal's Office handled the investigation of the explosions. While the cause of the explosions has not yet been determined, on August 21, 2008, Ontario's independent safety regulator for fuels, the Technical Standards and Safety Authority, released a statement saying that just before the explosion, a truck driver was illegally transferring propane from one truck to another. The agency also reported that in November 2006, Sunrise Propane was warned about its lack of safety by not stopping the truck-to-truck transfers at the company's facilities, and that truck-to-truck transfers were a frequent and routine operating practice at the facility.
An investigator with the Ontario Fire Marshal's Office stated that it could take months before the cause of the explosions can be determined. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also said that the province is willing to provide financial aid to residents whose homes were damaged by the explosions.
As of October 2009, the cause has not yet been determined. The Ontario Fire Marshal's office is still investigating the explosions and has yet to issue a report.
On August 4, 2010, The Toronto Star reported that the massive Sunrise propane explosion in 2008 was caused by an illegal "tank-to-tank transfer" along with a gas hose leak. The report said that liquid propane was released from a hose after a "tank-to-tank transfer" was completed. The Star reports that Sunrise didn't have the right licence to perform those types of transfers, and it was previously barred from doing so by the Technical Standards and Safety Authority in November 2006.
The Environment Ministry has argued that Sunrise failed "to show that there was a proper preventative maintenance system in place." While Leo Adler, Sunrise's lawyer, argued that the event was an unforeseeable accident because Sunrise kept their equipment in good order and cannot be held responsible for a hose failure.
Aftermath.
Due to its proximity to the site, Highway 401 was shut down from Highway 404 to Highway 400, and the local Yorkdale Mall was closed for part of the day. Toronto Transit Commission routes and the York Region Transit Viva Orange route were affected as a result of evacuation zone. Bus routes were diverted and a section of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway line between Downsview Station and Lawrence West Station was shut down for part of the day. GO Transit services to Yorkdale Bus Terminal were also suspended.
About 15 hours after the first explosions, some residents were given the go-ahead to return to their homes. However, many people returning to their homes were stopped at police checkpoints and turned back, or not permitted to take their vehicles into the immediate area. Approximately 100 of the 12,000 evacuated homes were left uninhabitable. On August 11, almost all residents who had to be evacuated were allowed back, though about 35 families had to wait while tests by health officials were conducted over concerns about airborne asbestos.
As a result of the explosion, Toronto officials plan on reviewing all industrial areas that could pose a potential threat to residential neighbourhoods to prevent similar situations. As part of its investigation, TSSA officials and the Ontario Fire Marshal are reviewing past inspections of the facility to determine the cause of the explosions.
The explosion caused damage to one of Toronto's oldest Jewish cemeteries, the Mount Sinai Memorial Park. The cemetery is over 100 years old and has more than 11,000 graves, of which at least 20 were damaged.
Various residents were angry because the municipal government allowed Sunrise to build a propane facility in a residential area. Some residents claim that the community was not consulted or notified about the facility when it was being built. However, Shelley Carroll, Toronto's acting deputy mayor, suggested that the facility had been zoned before many of the homes were built.
The Technical Standards and Safety Authority, the agency that regulates fuel safety in Ontario, originally said that it had only inspected Sunrise once since it opened in 2005. They later contradicted this by stating that they had issued stop work orders in 2006 and 2007 over safety violations.
On August 19, nine days after the explosions, Sunrise issued a short news release, stating that the company regrets the loss of life and that they were co-operating with authorities' investigations. The news release also said that they would not be making any more public comments in the near future to prevent speculation and misinformation. On August 21 2008 the TSSA issued a notice that Sunrise Propane should immediately have its authorization revoked.
Six other propane facilities in the province have been shut down as a result of an audit prompted by the explosions. Facilities in Kitchener, Waterloo, Cornwall, Ottawa, and two in Toronto have been ordered to shut down after failing to show that their employees were properly trained at the facilities.
Parminder Saini's father was granted a visa to travel from Punjab to Canada to aid in the investigation, although Parminder's brother and mother were denied by the Canadian Consulate. This decision was later changed after the Department of Citizenship and Immigration was informed of the situation.
Felipe De Leon, an employee at Sunrise, stated that he had completed an illegal propane transfer when he noticed smoke at the north end of the facility. De Leon said he then went inside the facility's office to warn Saini to flee the building, but he refused. De Leon then fled from the facility while Parminder walked towards the smoke.
Cleaning up the result of the explosion cost the city of Toronto $CAD 1.8 million, half of which was paid by the province of Ontario. Additionally, the residents filed a $300 million lawsuit. On June 27, 2013, Sunrise Propane was found guilty of nine non-criminal charges, with sentencing yet to come.

Gurion Hyman

Gurion Joseph Hyman (January 9, 1925) – Canadian Jewish Anthropologist, Linguist, Pharmacist, Composer, Artist, and Translator. Primary contributions have been (a) liturgical compositions for the Passover Haggadah and Sabbath prayer service, (b) translations into English as well as the setting to music of several internationally acclaimed Yiddish poets, (c) an (ongoing) project to write an etymological dictionary of Yiddish, and (d) proprietor of the second branch of Hyman's Book and Art Shoppe.
Early life.
Gurion Joseph Hyman was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and lived above his parents’ bookstore on Spadina Avenue, Hyman's Book and Art Shoppe, until marrying Ruth Alice Warner in 1952. The son of prominent Jewish community activists, Ben Zion Hyman and Fannie Konstantynowski (a descendant of Rabbi Shabbatai ha-Kohen), Gurion Hyman graduated from the Pharmacy program at the University of Toronto in 1946. During his early years, Gurion Hyman was exposed to multiple languages and developed fluency or significant proficiency in English, Yiddish, Hebrew, Russian and Polish. At the same time, he received formal piano training.
Career highlights.
After graduating in Pharmacy, Hyman worked for a time as a dispensing pharmacist, most notably at Halpren Drugs on Spadina Avenue in Toronto. In 1952, Hyman, along with his wife, Ruth, opened a branch of the family bookstore business on Eglinton Avenue in the Cedarvale/Forest Hill area of Toronto.
In 1962, the couple sold the bookstore and Hyman returned to the University of Toronto to pursue a career in Linguistic Anthropology. His primary area of scholarship was the reconstruction of Proto-Semitic, with particular emphasis on demonstrating the relationship between Hebrew and Aramaic using Noam Chomsky's deep structures theory.
In 1973, Hyman resumed his career as a dispensing pharmacist, working until 1990 at The Sheppard Pharmacy (owner: Sidney Brown). Sheppard Pharmacy was located at Bathurst Street and Sheppard Avenue in Toronto's North York borough, and through most of the 1980s had the largest volume of senior citizen prescriptions in Canada. Hyman's role was to facilitate communication with the large and linguistically diverse client base of this pharmacy.
During this entire period, Hyman pursued an avocation as a composer, primarily of liturgical music, and by 1975 had completed his major work, a complete musical score for the Haggadah of Pesach (Passover), which was eventually published in 1999. A second major liturgical work based on the Sabbath prayer service is due for publication in 2009.
In the 1990s, Hyman began working on compositions (and in some cases translations) of the poetry of Yiddish and Hebrew writers. Prominent among those has been Peretz Miransky, Simche Simchovitch, Avraham Sutskever, and Natan Alterman. Two collections have been published to date (see below), and the music has been featured in a number of venues, primarily performed by the Toronto-based Klezmer/Yiddish band De Shpeelers. More recently, Hyman has begun working with Spanish poetry and translating Yiddish poetry to Spanish. He has also completed several translations of Sherlock Holmes into Yiddish.
Etymological Dictionary of Yiddish.
An ongoing project is to produce an Etymological Dictionary of the Yiddish Language using multiple resources to 'best estimate' origin of word (Germanic, Semitic, Slavic, other). An intensive study of the 'word' in the original language is made. After compiling 'all' information available, the material is separated into three sections (a) Dictionary Entry with evolutionary path (b) Cross-referenced to Dictionary of Indo-European Roots and cognates, where applicable (in planning is a similar section for Proto-Semitic roots) (c) A definitional section of Yiddish-English correspondence.
Presently completed are words starting with 'aleph-bais', also prelimina ry work on words starting with 'aleph-yod', as well as some with 'shin-aleph'.

Meseritz Synagogue

Meseritz Shul, also known as Edath Lei'Isroel Ansche Meseritz, is a 1910 Orthodox synagogue on New York city's Lower East Side. It was built by a congregation established in 1888 consisting of immigrants from Międzyrzec Podlaski (Mesritch, Poland). The synagogue is located at 415 East 6th Street. Pesach Ackerman served as Rabbi from 1969 until his death on June 14, 2013.
Architecture.
The synagogue is unusual in being a very small, urban congregation on a narrow lot that has an extremely beautiful neo-classical facade, and is the last operating "tenement synagogue" in New York City's East Village. Andrew Berman of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation called it "an intact historic gem."
Architectural historian and New York University professor Gerald R. Wolfe describes the synagogue's "most attractive interior... The unusually narrow building has balconies which extend almost to the middle of the sanctuary, and through the intervening space, broad rays of light from two overhead skylights seem to focus on the Ark and on a large stained glass panel above it. The soft-yellow-colored panes of the two-story-high window are crowned by an enormous Mogen David of David of red glass which seems to dominate the entire room."
Andrew Dolkart, a Columbia University professor of historic preservation, believes that the neo-classical building should be preserved because cities should preserve "architecture that not only reflects the lives and history of the rich, but also the incredibly history of common people in New York."
Development controversy.
The congregation is negotiating with Joshua Kushner, part of the family that owns the New York Observer newspaper. Kushner plans to tear down the present neo-classical synagogue and build six-story residential building, housing the synagogue in a modern space on the lowest two floors. According to historic preservationist Samuel D. Gruber, there is a feasible but more costly alternative, which would preserve the synagogue building and build apartments above it. and have asked the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to landmark the building.
The Kushners later pulled out of the development deal.
In October 2012, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission created the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District, which included in its boundaries the Meseritz Synagogue.

Argyresthia curvella

__NOTOC__
Argyresthia curvella is a species of ermine moth (family Yponomeutidae). It belongs to subfamily Argyresthiinae, which is sometimes elevated to full family rank in the superfamily Yponomeutoidea. It is commonly called Apple Blossom Tineid, reflecting the fact that it was originally believed to be a tineid moth (family Tinieidae).
This small moth is widespread in northwestern Eurasia. It is absent from Iberia and probably the entire Balkans, and generally ranges southwards only to the northern Mediterranean region; a possibly isolated population occurs in the Caucasus region. Where it occurs, it is usually not rare and may be abundant. The nocturnal adults are attracted to light sources; they are on the wing around June/July or somewhat later, depending on the location.
The wingspan of adults is 10–12 mm. As usual for Yponomeutidae, the forewings have a bold black-and-white pattern, which fades easily in museum specimens though. The pattern consists of a thick oblique black line running from the center of the forewings' dorsal margin to somewhat nearer the apex on the costal margin. From the apex, a thinner and often somewhat irregular black band extends to meet the first one. The remaining areas of the forewings are generously sprinkled with small black blotches. The hindwings are pale greyish, as is the body. The caterpillars feed on "Malus" (apple) trees, where they eat the blossoms; it has also been suspected that they eat rotting apple wood at least occasionally. They may become a pest in apple orchards, if they occur in abundance.
Synonyms.
Invalid scientific names (junior synonyms and others) of the Apple Blossom Tineid are:
The species has been confused with the somewhat similar and fairly closely related Hawthorn Moth ("Scythropia crataegella") – the actual species described as "Tinea cornella" by J.C. Fabricius in 1775 – even in recent times.

Teshkoto or Tezhkoto (in Bulgarian: "Тежкото" and in Macedonian: "Тешкото", for "The Hard One"), is a Macedonian folk dance.
Origins of this folk dance are from the western part of Macedonia and are related to whole Miak region. This traditional folk dance is the image of the hard life that people from Macedonia lived starting from the second half of the 19th century. It is traditionally performed by the close family of a person who goes abroad to earn money for his family.
This folk dance has inspired many artists and poets (for example Blaze Koneski's poem "Teškoto" - "The Hard One"). The famous Bulgarian singer Veselin Marinov has a song with the same name.

HMS "Rochester" was a 50-gun fourth rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, built at Deptford Dockyard and launched on 3 August 1749.
In contrast to standard practise at the time, "Rochester" was not built to the Establishment of dimensions in effect at the time (in this case, the 1741 proposals of the 1719 Establishment). "Rochester" and her sister-ship, , were longer than the Establishment specified, and were ordered as an experiment in building larger ships in response to the widening gulf between the sizes of British ships and their continental counterparts.
"Rochester" was eventually sold out of the navy in 1770.

Marxist–Leninist Groups

Marxist–Leninist Groups () were the central organization of Finnish Maoists. The MLR were active from 1973 until 1979 and they had supporters in few cities but they always remained a small current with fewer than 200 members. The MLR had close contacts with the Chinese Communist Party and other Nordic Maoist parties.
The MLR were founded early in 1973 to unite local Maoist groups that had been founded around Finland. The "Marxist-Leninist Society of Helsinki" (HMLS), the first such group, had been active since the late 1960s. The HMLS (like the whole MLR) was mainly active in the radical youth and student movement. The activities of the Maoists were closely followed by the Suojelupoliisi, the KGB and the Communist Party of Finland (SKP), which fiercely condemned the anti-Soviet movement. The MLR were founded after the SKP began expulsions of Maoist cadre from its ranks.
The organization published two papers, theoretical "Punakaarti" (1969–1977) and agitational "Lokakuu" (1972–1978). MLR had book shops named "Lokakuu" () in Helsinki, Turku and Rauma. In the series "Classics of Marxism" MLR published works by Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Enver Hoxha and Karl Marx.
Many of the members who disbanded the MLR in 1979, including its leader Matti Puolakka, went to form Alternative Movement Itu (), which soon began moving away from Marxism-Leninism.

Jonathan Holmes (theatre director)

Jonathan Holmes (born 28 October 1975 in South Yorkshire) is a UK theatre director and writer. He attended Wath Comprehensive School, The University of Birmingham (where he emerged with a first-class degree) and completed a Ph.D at The Shakespeare Institute. He is a cousin of army officer William Thomas Forshaw and film director Cy Endfield.
For six years he taught Drama at Royal Holloway, University of London, leaving as a Senior Lecturer in 2007. During his time there he wrote two books: "Merely Players" (about the rhetoric of classical acting) and "Refiguring Mimesis" (with Adrian Streete, about aesthetics). He also set up a new degree programme in Drama and English.
During this first career he became an expert in the work of John Donne, and organised the first live performance for four centuries of several of Donne’s songs at St. Paul’s Cathedral in 2005. Performers included Dame Emma Kirkby, Carolyn Sampson and The Sixteen. The event sold out, and the proceeds were donated to the charity Peace Direct. In 2011 he also wrote and directed "Into Thy Hands", a biographical play on Donne.
In 2007 he wrote, directed and produced the play "Fallujah", starring Harriet Walter, Imogen Stubbs and Irène Jacob. It ran in a specially tailored space on Brick Lane with a score by Nitin Sawhney and design by the conceptual artist Lucy Orta. At the time it was the only significant account of the sieges of Fallujah, and is composed entirely of verbatim testimony. In 2008 he collaborated with the choir and period instrument orchestra The Sixteen and actors Alan Howard and Virginia McKenna in a series of concerts at the South Bank Centre.
He has also written and directed two short films, starring Rebecca Lenkiewicz, Elliot Cowan and Julian Ovenden, and is nearing completion on a feature documentary, "Perpetual Peace". This last includes interviews with peacemakers around the world and features contributions by Harold Pinter, John Berger, Karen Armstrong, George Monbiot, Tony Benn and Noreena Hertz, among others.
In 2008 he set up The Jericho House, a movable performance venue specialising in cross-media collaborations around the theme of hospitality. The Jericho House is groundbreaking in its use of sound and music, leading Holmes to set up a partnership with The Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience examining the effect of sound on the brain.
In 2009 Jericho produced a critically acclaimed site-specific testimony play about the neglect of New Orleans after the hurricane. It was called simply 'Katrina’, and the run sold out completely. 
In 2010 Holmes began a campaign for continuing state support for the arts with an event called ‘What’s the point of art?’, attended by many influential people from the creative industries. The resulting public debate led to all three main parties committing to maintaining arts funding at 2009 levels at the next spending round.
He lives in North London.

Lionel Morgan (born 12 August 1938) is an Indigenous Australian former rugby league footballer, named amongst the nation's finest of the 20th century, and current coach. Morgan was the first Indigenous Australian to be selected to play in a recognised rugby league Test match. He primarily played on the wing.
A New South Wales' Schoolboy representative player, Morgan moved from Tweed Heads to play for Wynnum-Manly in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership. In 1960 he was selected for the second and third Tests of the French tour of Australia. He scored two tries on his international debut. At the end of the 1960 season, he played one match for Australia in the 1960 World Cup, again against France, at Wigan. Morgan's selection for the Tests made him the first Indigenous Australian to represent at an international level in any major national sporting team. In 1962 he was named Queensland's "Best Back".
A representative of Brisbane in the Bulimba Cup, Morgan scored 24 tries and 147 points in just 18 games between 1959 and 1963. In 1962, he scored 5 tries and 6 goals in a single match against Ipswich.
Morgan was subjected to racism throughout his career. He has described an incident in a match against Ipswich. "I was tackled over the sideline, and apparently the whole Ipswich team jumped on top of me," he said. "I woke up in hospital." In another incident he was hospitalised after being punched by a spectator. 
Morgan's four sons all spent time playing for Wynnum-Manly.
Morgan continues his association with rugby league as coach of the Queensland Rugby League's Indigenous Under-16 team.
In August, 2008, Morgan was named on the wing in the "Indigenous Team of the Century".

<doc id="18796632" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18796632" title="Costa Tropical">
Costa Tropical

Costa Tropical (, "Tropical Coast") is a comarca in southern Spain, corresponding to the Mediterranean coastline of the province of Granada, Andalusia. It is also but less frequently called the Costa de Granada or Costa Granadina. It is crossed by the N-340 coastal highway that runs southwest-northeast along Spain’s Mediterranean coast, to the border with France. Within the last 4 years the A7 has been extended from Nerja in the Malaga province to the Taramay district to the east of Almuñécar. Construction is ongoing to link the A7 motorway to the A44 motorway which heads north from Motril on the coast to the city of Granada. This connection should be complete before April 2012 according to the Spanish Ministry of Development. Originally the whole section of A7 motorway up to Carchuna was due to be completed by early 2011 but the motorway has been besieged by delays due to technical difficulties and the Torrecuevas bridge collapse on 7 November 2005, when six workers died.
Geography.
The Costa Tropical is made up mostly of agricultural zones and small resort towns and villages. What makes the Costa Tropical unique in comparison to the rest of the Spanish coast is that the mountains of the Sierra Nevada range fall to the very edge of the Mediterranean Sea on the rugged coastline. Except for "la vega de Motril", there are no flat areas for large urban sprawl, unlike the Costa del Sol in the Málaga province. 
Climate.
The area east of Málaga is less dry and more lush than the surrounding areas. This is because the Sierra Nevada mountain range that serves as a backdrop to the Costa Tropical catches more rain and thus supplies the area with abundant irrigation. This same mountain backdrop provides a shelter from northerlies and creates a pleasant microclimate of very mild winters and mild summers compared to the interior of Spain, with temperature differences of relative to the area on the other side of the mountains – so it could be on a summer day in the city of Granada and only on the Costa Tropical. In the winter, it can be snowing in Granada and on the Costa Tropical.
Principal towns.
The principal towns of the Costa Tropical are Motril and Almuñécar. Motril is principally a manufacturing and agricultural center (horticulture, vegetables, tropical fruits and some sugar cane, although the last is declining). Motril also possesses a small seaport. Almuñécar is primarily a resort town and agricultural center (tropical fruits), with the summer-time vacation population more than tripling the town’s population. Like the rest of the Spanish coast, it recently underwent a housing and construction boom with some environmental degradation. This housing boom was not as severe as on other parts of the Spanish coastline due to the townships of Almunecar and La Herradura being unable to agree the terms of their new Urban plan (PGOU) with the Junta de Andalucia since 2002.
Points of interest.
The Costa Tropical has many historical sights, including prehistoric cave paintings in nearby Nerja; many Roman ruins including roads, bridges, buildings, fish salting factories, and irrigation systems used to this day; and abundant remains of the many-centuries domination of the region by the Arab conquerors. In fact, Almuñécar served as the entry point to Iberia and establishment of a power base for Abd ar-Rahman I in 755, who came from Damascus and was the founder of an independent Muslim dynasty that ruled the greater part of Iberia for nearly three centuries thereafter.

In ancient times, the Heroopolite Gulf was the Gulf of Suez in the vicinity of Heroopolis; there is evidence indicating that the Red Sea and its Gulf of Suez extended as far northward as the Bitter Lakes of Egypt. 
Ptolemy II Philadelphus opened a west-east "Suez" canal in Heroopolis (circa 270-269 BC) and constructed a navigable lock, with sluices, between the Heroopolite Gulf and the Red Sea so as to allow the passage of vessels but prevent salt water from the Red Sea from mingling with the fresh water in the canal.
Ancient cities which were at one time situated along the coastline of the Heroopolite Gulf include Arsinoe, Heroopolis and Olbia.

Réti endgame study

The Réti endgame study is a chess endgame study by Richard Réti. It was published in 1921 in "Kagans Neueste Schachnachrichten". It demonstrates how a king can make multiple threats and how it can take more than one path to a given location, using the same number of moves. It is arguably the most famous endgame study and is covered in many books on the endgame (see chess endgame literature). The procedure is known as the "Réti Maneuver" or "Réti's Idea" , , . Endgame composer Abram Gurvich called the theme "The Hunt of Two Hares" and it appears in many other studies and games . It is also called "chasing two birds at once" .
The study.
White is to move and draw in this position. At first inspection, it appears that White has no hope in drawing. His king is well outside the "square" of the black pawn (see king and pawn versus king endgame) and the king is a long way from supporting his own pawn. However, White can draw by making king moves that have two purposes. One goal is getting in the square of the black pawn, so it can be intercepted and the other is getting to the "d6" square to support the promotion of his pawn.
The black king will have to spend two tempi to stop the white pawn from promoting, and this is the number of tempi the white king needs to gain in order to get into the square of the black pawn.
The second diagram shows the number of ways that the white king can get to various squares in the minimum number of moves. There are nine ways to get to "d6", but only one of them allows him to get into the square of the black pawn.
The solution is for the white king to follow the path on the diagonal marked by "1" and then follow the dots to intercept the black pawn (if necessary):
Another study with the same idea.
Réti used the same idea in another study. The solution is:
Examples from games.
Yates versus Marshall.
In this game between Frederick Yates and Frank Marshall, Black draws using the same idea:
Lasker versus Tarrasch.
In this 1914 game between World Champion Emanuel Lasker and Siegbert Tarrasch, Black exchanged down into this position because he thought it was a win, but White used the maneuver above to draw the game. 
The theme of this endgame was used later by Réti in the study .

Samuel D. Gruber

Samuel D. Gruber is an American art and architectural historian. He has written extensively on the architecture of the synagogue and is an expert and activist in the documentation, protection and preservation of historic Jewish sites and monuments. He was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania and lives in Syracuse, New York.
He is Director of Gruber Heritage Global which includes the Jewish Heritage Research Center (Syracuse, NY), a private consulting firm; and President of the not-for-profit educational International Survey of Jewish Monuments (ISJM). From 1989 until 1995 he served as founding director of the Jewish Heritage Council of the World Monuments Fund and from 1998 through 2008 as Research Director of the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad. In these roles Gruber has been, in the words of journalist Bill Gladstone, "in the vanguard of an international movement to restore endangered Jewish heritage sites around the world." 
In the decade and a half following the fall of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe (1990-2005), Gruber organized and supervised for the World Monuments Fund and the U.S. Commission more than a dozen countrywide surveys of cultural heritage sites of significance to religious and ethnic minorities. These identified, mostly for the first time, thousands of previously unrecognized and undocumented synagogues, churches, mosques, cemeteries and Holocaust-related sites, almost all of which were visited and by survey teams that described their condition. These projects included full or partial surveys of Jewish sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine; Roma sites in Poland; Old Believers sites in Lithuania; and Protestant Christian and Muslim sites in Bulgaria.
He is author or editor of numerous articles and survey reports about Jewish monuments, and is a frequent public lecturer in the United States and Europe.
In 1990, for the World Monuments Fund, Gruber organized and chaired the first international conference on the preservation of Jewish historic sites. He curated the accompanying exhibition "The Future of Jewish Monuments" at the Joseph Gallery of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Since then he has participated and helped organize many related conferences and seminars including ones in Paris (1999), Prague (2004), and Bratislava (2009).
Since 2001 he has been Lecturer in Judaic Studies at Syracuse University. where he teaches courses on Jewish art and architecture. He has also taught at Temple, Binghamton, Cornell and Colgate universities.
From 2010 through 2012 Gruber was curator of the Plastics Collection at the Special Collection Research Center (SCRC) at the Syracuse University Library.
Gruber was trained as a medievalist and architectural historian and is an expert on medieval urbanism, and especially Italian medieval towns and cities.
Education.
Gruber attended the American Overseas School of Rome from which he graduated in 1973. His father, anthropologist Jacob W. Gruber was director of Temple University's Rome campus, and it was there that he developed his love or architecture. While there he studied Art History with urban historian Allan Ceen. Gruber received his B.A. degree in Medieval Studies from Princeton University where he studied with Joseph Strayer, William Chester Jordan, Robert Bergman, David Coffin, Robert Hollander and other distinguished scholars. He received his M.A, M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in the History of Art and Archaeology, where he studied with Richard Brilliant, Alfred Frazer, Jerrilynn Dodds, Howard Hibbard, David Rosand, Joseph Connors, George Collins and other professors. His master's paper was a study of early medieval and Longobard masonry in Italy. His doctoral dissertation was study of the architecture and urbanism of medieval Todi (Italy).
Awards and honors.
Gruber is a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome. He is recipient of many grants individually, or for projects with which he is involved. Since 2006 he has received research grants from the James Marston Fitch Charitable Foundation, the AIA New York Chapter, and the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation.
Community service.
In addition to his work for the International Survey of Jewish Monuments, which he took over from Raina Fehl, Gruber serves on many charitable boards and advisory committees. He was Executive Director of the Preservation Association of Central New York in 1999-2000, and served as Board President of the organization from 2004 through 2009. Since 2009 he has written the blog "My Central New York" about historic preservation, history and architecture in Central New York. He has also served on the Facilities Community of Temple Society of Concord (Temple Concord) in Syracuse since 1998 for which he researched and wrote the National Register of Historic Places nomination in 2008 and co-chaired the Building Centennial Committee in 2010-11. Gruber has been active for many years in efforts to document, protect and preserve historic houses of worship in Central New York. He has provided historical and art commentary on South Presbyterian Church and Holy Trinity Church and serves on the Save 711 E. Fayette Committee formed to preserve the former AME Zion church.

Unitary method

The unitary method is a technique in elementary algebra for solving a class of problems in variation. It consists of altering one of the variables to a single unit, i.e. 1, and then performing the operation necessary to alter it to the desired value.
For example, to solve the problem. 'A man walks seven miles in two hours. What is his average speed?', we aim to calculate how far the man walks in one hour. We can safely assume that he would walk half the distance in half the time. In one hour (one half of two hours) he walks three and a half miles (one half of seven miles). His speed is therefore three and a half miles per hour.
We can apply the same method to the problem 'A man walks at four miles per hour. How long would it take him to cover five miles?' by asking first, how long does the man take to walk one mile. One is a quarter of four, so it takes him a quarter of an hour to walk one mile. To walk five miles it therefore takes him five quarter hours, or an hour and a quarter.

Chase v. Curtis

Chase v. Curtis, , was a suit brought under the provisions of §12 of the Act of the Legislature of New York of February 17, 1848, as amended June 7, 1875, where trustees of corporations formed for manufacturing, mining, mechanical, or chemical purposes are made liable for debts of the company on failure to file the reports of capital and of debts required by that section, is penal in its character, and must be construed with strictness as against those sought to be subjected to its liabilities. Suit was brought to recover from the trustees of such a corporation the amount of a judgment against the corporation, the judgment roll is not competent evidence to establish a debt due from the corporation to the plaintiff.
A claim in tort against a corporation formed under that act, as amended, is not a debt of the company for which the trustees may become liable jointly and severally under the provisions of the Act. In a proceeding to enforce a liability created by a state statute, the courts of the United States give to a judgment of a state court the same effect, either as evidence or as cause of action, which is given to it in like proceedings in the courts of the state whose laws are invoked in the enforcement.
The complaint in this action, after alleging that the plaintiff in error was a citizen of Pennsylvania, and the defendants citizens of New York, proceeded as follows:
"Wherefore the plaintiffs demand judgment against the above-named defendants in the sum of $40,828.97, with interest on $40,500.00 from the 30th day of July, 1874, and on $328.97 from the 3d day of October, 1874, besides the costs and disbursements of this action."
To this complaint the defendants severally demurred on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrer was sustained and judgment rendered in favor of the defendants dismissing the complaint, to reverse which this writ of error is prosecuted.
The statute on which the action is founded is as follows:
"SECTION 1. The twelfth section of the 'Act to authorize the formation of corporations for manufacturing, mining, mechanical, or chemical purposes,' passed February 17, 1848, as said section was amended by chapter 657 of the Laws of 1871, is hereby further amended, so that section 12 shall read as follows:"
It is finally insisted that a judgment against the corporation, although founded upon a tort, becomes ipso facto a debt by contract, being a contract of record or a specialty in the nature of a contract. But we have already seen that the settled course of decision in the New York Court of Appeals rejects the judgment against the corporation as either evidence or ground of liability against the trustees, and founds the latter upon the obligation of the corporation on which the judgment itself rests. And it was decided by this Court in the case of Louisiana v. New Orleans, 109 U. S. 285, that a liability for a tort, created by statute, although reduced to judgment by a recovery for the damages suffered, did not thereby become a debt by contract in the sense of the Constitution of the United States forbidding state legislation impairing its obligation, for the reason that the term 'contract' is used in the Constitution in its ordinary sense as signifying the agreement of two or more minds, for considerations proceeding from one to the other, to do or not to do certain acts. Mutual assent to its terms is of its very essence."
The same definition applies in the present instance, and excludes the liability of the defendants, as trustees of the corporation, for its torts, although reduced to judgment.
The court found no error in the judgment of the circuit court, and it was accordingly affirmed.

Emmanuel Ake

Emmanuel Ake Richard Muttendango (born 11 June 1980 in Mombasa) is a Kenyan footballer of Seychellois ancestry. Ake plays for the Danish Danmarksserien club FC Djursland. He has spent the past ten seasons playing for different clubs in Denmark.
False name and birth date.
Emannuel Ake entered Europe with a temporarily visa because of the fact he had to play a testmatch in the Netherlands. When this turned out wrong for him, he left the Netherlands all of a sudden to go to his father in Denmark without a regular Visa. When Ake first came to Denmark in 2000, he identified himself as "Ali Rajab Akida", or just "Ali Akida", born 20 December 1982. It was later discovered that the information was incorrect and that his real name was Emmanuel Ake Richard Muttendango, born 11 June 1980. Ake was subsequently fined 7,000 DKK by the Gladsaxe City Court. After a number of rulings and subsequent appeals from the involved parties, the Sports Confederation of Denmark (DIF) suspended Ake for three months.
Ake's club at the time, Akademisk Boldklub, was also awarded a 50,000 DKK fine, and all the points AB's first and reserve teams had collected in matches in which Ake had participated were lost.
Club career.
Early career.
Ake's mother is from Kenya, and his father from Seychelles. His parents divorced and his father moved to Denmark. He started his senior career with Black Panther in the Coast Provincial League (3rd level in Kenya). He then moved to Mombasa-based Coast Stars in the Kenyan Premier League. A Dutch tourist and his son met his mother in Kenya and found out about his football-skills. In Kenya he wouldn't be able to get a living out of playing football. The Dutchman tried to give him a future and arranged a temporarily visa for Ake and invited him over to the Netherlands, to stay with them and to play a test match with FC Oss (second division of Holland) (team formerly know as TOP Oss). After the unsuccessful trials he left the guest-family and travelled to his father in Denmark.
Denmark.
As a 20-year-old, Ake was signed by Akademisk Boldklub, where he spent four seasons from 2000 to 2004. He then moved to FC Nordsjælland for the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons.
Ake was loaned out by FC Nordsjælland for the second half of the 2005-06 season to Ølstykke FC. He was the club's top scorer with 14 goals. In the next seasons, Ake was loaned to second-division side Holbæk B&I, where he also emerged as the club's top scorer with 11 goals.
In the 2007-08 season, Ake was on loan once again, this time to First Division side Hellerup IK (HIK). He scored 13 league goals, tops on the club, but the team was still relegated to Division 2.
Ake then signed a three-year contract with Herfølge Boldklub. He joined the club after he was declared a free agent by FC Nordsjælland.
HB Køge.
Ake was a part of the new HB Køge team, founded in 2009 after a merger between Herfølge and Køge Boldklub. The new season started very well for Ake, who scored five goals in 13 league matches. However, he was severely injured in November 2009, rupturing his achilles tendon. Ake inspired a lot of people at HB Koge including the well known Will Holmes.
Lyngby BK.
In September 2010 he signed with Lyngby Boldklub.
Næstved BK.
In February 2011 he signed an amateur contract with Næstved Boldklub. He left the club in the summer of 2011.
Svebølle B&I.
On 1 February 2012 he agreed to play at Danish 2nd Division club Svebølle B&I, because the club was managed by his old team mate from Holbæk B&I, Erdogan Aslan.
FC Djursland.
In September 2012 he returned to Denmark to play for FC Djursland in Danmarksserien, the fourth tier of the Danish football system.
International career.
Ake was part of the Kenyan National team, the Harambee Stars, at the Tunisia 2004 African Cup of Nations. He made three appearances for the Harambee Stars. He scored the third goal against Burkina Faso, earning Kenya its first-ever win at the Nations Cup.

Yuanyuan Tan

Yuanyuan Tan (born in Shanghai in 1974, ; is a principal dancer with the San Francisco Ballet. She entered Shanghai Dance School at the age of 11. Initially her father opposed this, as he wanted her to become a medical doctor. Her mother, however, was very supportive. Her fate was settled by a coin toss - the coin landed on heads and Yuan Yuan Tan started her dancing career.
She won multiple international awards at an early age; including a gold medal and the Nijinsky Award at the 1st Japan International Ballet and Modern Dance Competition (1993) and a gold medal in the 5th International Ballet Competition in Paris (1992). At age 18, she became a soloist dancer with the San Francisco Ballet Company. Two years later, in 1997, at age 20, she was promoted to principal dancer, attaining the highest position for a ballet dancer, an unusually rapid upward path. She was at that time the youngest principal dancer ever in the history of the San Francisco Ballet company. Today, she is a marquee name for the company, while San Francisco Ballet Company itself is widely considered to be among the best in the world and in the words of choreographer Mark Morris, the "best company in North America". 
She has danced lead female roles in Helgi Tomasson's Giselle, Swan Lake, Romeo and Juliet, Nutcracker, Tomasson/Possokhov's Don Quixote, Morris' Sylvia, and Lubovitch's Othello. She created roles in Tomasson's The Fifth Season, Chi-Lin, Silver Ladders, and 7 for Eight, Possokhov's Magrittomania, Damned, and Study in Motion, Wheeldon's Continuum and Quaternary, and Welch's Tu Tu. Her repertory includes Ashton's Thaïs Pas de Deux, Balanchine's Symphony in C, Theme and Variations, Concerto Barocco, Prodigal Son, and Apollo, Duato's Without Words, Robbins' In the Night, Dances at a Gathering, and Dybbuk, and Makarova's Paquita. 
Her fame is much greater in China, as she is the most critically acclaimed Chinese ballet dancer ever, and the only Chinese ballet dancer to reach the rank of principal dancer at a major international ballet company. She has been featured in the Chinese versions of Vogue, Esquire, and Tatler. Currently she is also a brand ambassador for Van Cleef & Arpels and Rolex.

Tirumalarya could refer to two Kannada poets in the Wodeyar court.
In the court of Raja Wodeyar, Tirumala Iyengar or Tirumalarya the elder (1600) composed the "Karna Vrittanta Kathe" in Kannada in sangatya metre. According to tradition, Tirumalarya was a descendant of Kirangooru Anantaraya, an "acharya" (teacher) nominated by the 11th century philosopher Ramanujacharya.
Among well known scholars, Tirumalarya (son of the earlier Tirumalarya in the court of Raja Wodeyar), a native of Srirangapatna and a childhood friend of the king, was the court poet. He was also a minister in the court of the Queen of Madurai. Well known among his writings in Kannada are "Chikka Devaraja Saptapadi" (1698), a musical treatise and a eulogy for his patron king rendered in seven sections with fifty-two songs. In this work, the poet exalts the king to the level of "God on Earth". It is, along with "Geetha Gopala", considered one of the more important 17th century treatises on music. Tirumalarya's other well-known contributions in Kannada are "Apratimavira Charite", a eulogy for his patron king, "Chikkadevaraja Vijaya", an account of the king's conquests in sixteen chapters and "Chikkadevaraja Vamshavali", the earliest available Kannada prose historical writing, describing the king's ancestry. In addition, he composed in tripadi, sangatya, kirtanas and other devotional songs in Kannada and Telugu.

Anabela

Anabela Braz Pires (born September 22, 1976 in Almada) is a Portuguese singer and musical theatre actress, best known in Portugal by her first name, Anabela.
Her career in music has spanned over two decades, and she is well known for representing Portugal at the Eurovision Song Contest, her work as a solo recording artist, and her work in musical theatre collaborating with producer Filipe La Féria. In a 2006 interview with "Selecções do Reader's Digest", she joked that in the national consciousness, she went from being known as "the Eurovision girl" to "the La Féria girl."
Early life and career.
Anabela Braz Pires was born on September 22, 1976 in Almada, Portugal, a suburb of Lisbon situated across the Tagus River. She started singing professionally at the age of eight, participating in various children's festivals. In 1989, at age 12, she won the "Grande Noite do Fado". That year she represented Portugal at the UNICEF Song Festival in the Netherlands where she received second place and won the Danny Kaye Award for Best Interpreter. 
In 1991, she participated in the Sopot International Song Festival representing Portugal with the song "Brother." From there, she released albums in 1991 and 1992, "Anabela" and "Encanto" ("Charm"), released on the Ovação fado music label.
Music career.
1993: "Festival RTP da Canção" and Eurovision.
On January 10, 1993, when Anabela was 16, she entered the Festival RTP da Canção ("Rádio e Televisão de Portugal Song Festival"), where she competed in the first round's second heat and tied for joint first place with Grupo Até Jazz with their song "Pó de melhorar" ("Get well powder"). Both songs progressed to the final held on March 11, where they competed against six other winners from various first round heats. 
In the end, Anabela won, and on May 15, she went on to represent Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993 in Millstreet, Ireland, with the song she performed at the Festival RTP da Canção, "A cidade (até ser dia)" "(The city, until dawn)". She placed tenth with 60 points from various competing countries. It was Portugal's first top ten ranking in the Contest in two years, and only the second top ten placement since 1980. The song was the lead single on her third album, also called "A cidade, até ser dia."
1996–2002: Solo work and musical theater debut.
Her fourth album was released in 1996 and was called "Primeiras Águas" ("First Water"), which yielded the hit song "Avenidas" written by Clara Pinto Correia and Rui Veloso. That year she also participated in Filipe La Féria's children's musical "Jasmim ou o Sonho do Cinema" ("Jasmine: The Dream of Cinema"). In 1999, Anabela worked with La Féria again, starring in the musical "Koko". She released another album that same year, heralded by HMV Japan as "the new generation of fado," called "Origens" ("Sources").
In 2000, she recorded four tracks with the Galician musician Carlos Núñez for his album "Mayo Longo" ("Long May"), and participated in the promotional tour, which lasted two and a half years and took her around the world. Returning to Portugal in 2002, she continued her association with La Féria, playing protagonist Eliza Doolittle in the Lisbon production of "My Fair Lady".
2005: Experimental album.
In 2005, she released her first album in six years, which was an interpretation of poems called "Aether". With the help of Carlos Maria Trindade, she interpreted the poems of Portuguese writers Florbela Espanca, Fernando Pessoa, Manuel Alegre and José Carlos Ary dos Santos. She also released a Spanish version of her album on Resistencia Records. In March 2006, she performed three special concerts in Spain and two in the Azores, performing some of the works on the "Aether" album.
2006–present: "Música no Coração", "Jesus Cristo Superstar" and "Amor Sem Barreiras".
In 2006, Anabela and popular singer Lúcia Moniz took turns playing the part of Maria von Trapp in "Música no Coração" (roughly translated as "Music in the Heart"), the Portuguese production of "The Sound of Music" at the Teatro Politeama in Lisbon. This was a continuation of Anabela's working relationship with La Féria, as he directed the production. 
In December 2007 the show was taken on the road to Porto, where Anabela reprised her role at the Teatro Rivoli with Wanda Stuart. The musical celebrated its 500th show in Portugal, in April 2008, and finished its run on May 4, 2008.
Taking a break of less than a month, Anabela returned to the stage on May 30, 2008, at the Teatro Politeama, in Lisbon, working again with La Féria. She stepped into the role of Mary Magdalene in "Jesus Cristo Superstar", the Lisbon production of "Jesus Christ Superstar", taking over the part from Sara Lima. For the entire month of August 2008, Anabela and the entire company performed the musical in Portimão, in the Algarve.
As of November 28, 2008, she is participating in La Féria's newest musical production, "Amor Sem Barreiras", the Portuguese adaptation of "West Side Story", at Lisbon's Politeama. Anabela plays the role of Anita, the sensual and confident woman whose boyfriend is the leader of the Sharks, a gang composed by the first generation of Americans from Puerto Rico. Again, her part is performed in turns with Lúcia Moniz. Talking about her character, Anabela confessed it is her "career's greatest challenge. Completely different from what I have been doing so far." She further explains that "the attitude, poise and voice are very distinct from mine and clash with the roles of young innocent girl that I am used to performing."
Voiceover work.
In addition to being a recording artist and stage actress, Anabela is also known for her voiceover work as a singing voice. For Disney she was the singing voices for Ariel in "The Little Mermaid," the title character in "Mulan" and Rapunzel in "Tangled." In addition to her Disney voices, she was the singing voice for Kayley in "The Quest for Camelot" for Warner Bros. and the singing voice for Miriam in "The Prince of Egypt" for DreamWorks.

Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge

Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1988 to protect the Mississippi/Red River floodplain ecosystem. The refuge is located in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, east central Louisiana. The refuge is named for its most prominent water body, the Lake Ophelia that was at one time a channel of the nearby Red River.
Habitat.
The land surrounding Lake Ophelia was once part of a vast bottomland hardwood forest that stretched along the Mississippi River. Much of this forestland, including large areas of what would become Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge, was cleared for agriculture in the 1970s. Levees have changed the hydrology of the refuge, but the underlying ridge/swale topography supports a variety of habitat types. Bottomland hardwood forest, croplands, fallow fields, moist soil units, and cypress-tupelo brakes are intermixed with meandering bayous, pristine lakes, ponds, sloughs, and the Red River. This variety of vegetative communities in turn supports a diversity of wildlife. Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, the refuge is served by the Mississippi and Central Flyways.
Wildlife.
Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge supports a wide variety of wildlife species. Though established primarily for waterfowl, the refuge also is a place for all or part of the year for mammals, songbirds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Many of these animals are difficult to see. Hiding throughout the refuge are creatures great and small such as bobcats, alligators, red and grey fox and wild turkeys. River otter, beaver, raccoon, mink and nutria also make the refuge their home. Other animals that are more frequently seen include white-tailed deer, squirrels, little blue herons, night herons, and barred owls. Many songbirds and wading birds arrive in the spring, and the waters are full of game fish such as channel catfish, largemouth bass and crappie (white perch).
Due to its location in east-central Louisiana, this area is influenced by both the Mississippi and Central Flyways. These highways in the sky are the route for millions of duck and geese each spring and fall. Although mallards, gadwall and green-winged teal are the most abundant waterfowl species on the refuge; wood ducks, blue-winged teal, northern shovelers, northern pintails, and widgeon are also plentiful. Diving ducks such as scaup and ring-necked ducks use deeper refuge waters. Canada, snow and white-fronted geese can sometimes be observed feeding in harvested croplands. 
Although mallards, northern pintails, and wood ducks are the most numerous waterfowl species on the refuge, blue- and green-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall, and American Widgeon are also common. Primary diving ducks are scaup and ring-necked ducks. Canada, snow, and greater white-fronted geese are present, though less common. 
Several hundred native species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fishes, and insects are found on the refuge. Common, though often difficult to see, species include bobcats, alligators, red and grey foxes, turkeys, mink, and otter. More frequently encountered are white-tailed deer, raccoons, fox squirrels, beaver, marsh hawks, and wading birds. Many neotropical migratory songbirds use the refuge at various times. Refuge fisheries are composed largely of largemouth bass, gar, crappie, bowfin, bream species, buffalo, carp, and catfish.
Endangered species numbers are few and their presence is always marked with special interest. The arctic peregrine falcon is an occasional visitor, and thanks to the refuge's three-year bald eagle reintroduction project, bald eagle sightings are common. The threatened Louisiana black bear is rarely sighted moving through the area, but is expected to reestablish as the Tensas River bear population to the north and the Atchafalaya River population to the south increase. As young bears look for new homes, the refuge and surrounding woodlands can play an important role in its recovery. Not only will this area serve as a corridor linking these two existing bear populations, but also as habitat for additional bears. 
Two centuries ago the Lower Mississippi River Valley contained over of bottomland hardwood and swamp forests. Today, only of wetland forests remain, most as islands in a sea of agriculture. Gone from Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge are the Florida panther and red wolf, lost forever are the ivory-billed woodpecker and Backman’s warbler.
Management.
Lake Ophelia National Wildlife is actively managed to provide a diverse habitats for the myriad of animal species that abound here. Croplands, reforested uplands, bottomland hardwoods, cypress swamps and permanent waters are molded to benefit wildlife.
Refuge croplands are farmed on a share basis, leaving part of the crops in the fields for refuge wildlife. Moist soil areas are managed by lowering and raising water levels to promote natural vegetation favored by ducks and geese. During the fall and winter, croplands and naturally vegetated areas are flooded, thus “setting the table” for wintering waterfowl. In late summer, wetland pools are dried to create mudflats for migrating shorebirds. 
In efforts to restore large forested block and re-link fragmented forest, several Federal and State natural resource agencies are promoting reforestation of marginal privately owned land and replanting cleared forest on public land. Lake Ophelia National Wildlife Refuge is part of these efforts. Many agricultural fields on the refuge have been planted with hardwood trees that once dominated the land. These native oaks, cypress, ash, gum, and pecan trees will help restore the bottomland hardwood and swamp forests that supported such a large diversity of wildlife.
