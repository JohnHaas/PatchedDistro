Spongebath Records

Spongebath Records was an independent record label based in Murfreesboro, Tennessee during the mid-nineties. During its heyday, Spongebath was often viewed as the vibrant center of Murfreesboro/Nashville's (and the Southeast's) music scene with a robust artist roster of critically acclaimed bands, singers, and songwriters. 
From 1997-1999, Spongebath attracted national press and media attention for garnering co-label deals with DreamWorks Records (for Self's 1999 album "Breakfast with Girls") and with Elektra Records (for the Katies self-titled 1999 album.) Bands/artists on Spongebath at one time or another included: Self, Fluid Ounces, the Katies, The Features, Count Bass D, Fleshpaint, The C60's, The New System, The Roaries, Gumption, Call Florence Pow, Ruby Amanfu, and Knodel.
History.
The label began as the brainchild of three people: Self frontman Matt Mahaffey (who had just dropped out of MTSU), singer/songwriter Seth Timbs (of Fluid Ounces), and Mahaffey's manager Rick Williams. Timbs, in fact, was the one who came up with the name "Spongebath." 
In the mid-to-late '90s, there was a resurgence of interest in the Middle Tennessee rock scene, when Spongebath Records began to turn heads for signing promising, talented local bands like Self, Fluid Ounces, and The Features. Their office was located at 101 N. Maple in downtown Murfreesboro, and they were impossible to miss--the walls were painted in bright purple, yellow, and red colors, allowing it to stand out amidst a sleepy, rather drab and comfortably geriatric courthouse/downtown square. 
The label even got the attention of Billboard, which ran a cover story in August 1997 chronicling Murfreesboro's rise as "an emerging music mecca," while other writers half-jokingly began to refer to the scene as "little Seattle." In reality, the Murfreesboro music scene was much more in line with progressive college-towns like Athens, Georgia and Austin, Texas--towns that had a rich history of championing indie rock and quality bands.
Regionally, at least, the Spongebath brand itself became fairly synonymous with top quality music, ranging from the melodic indie pop of the Features, the Katies' radio-friendly brand of hard rock, or the genre-blurring hip-hop of Count Bass-D. All the Spongebath releases--largely recorded on minimal, scattershot budgets--tended to receive wonderful critical acclaim. Even the packaging for Spongebath releases was different: Brian Bottcher's artwork for albums like Self's "Breakfast with Girls", Fluid Ounces' "In the New Old-Fashioned Way", or Count Bass-D's "Art for Sale" all had an unmistakable, distinct, and sophisticated visual flair.
Self was the most successful of the label's artists, the band having modest success and developing a cult following with "Subliminal Plastic Motives" while getting spins for "So Low" and "Cannon" on MTV. 
Because of Spongebath's prime location (on the downtown Square and only a few doors down from Sebastian's, one of the most frequented clubs in Murfreesboro during that time) and casual, fun atmosphere, one would often find various labelmates/band members at the Spongebath offices answering phones, sending mail, making posters, folding t-shirts, or just hanging out. Spongebath encouraged fans of the label and of the bands to come by the office, and many did, either begging Williams to listen to their demo tape or simply asking how or where they could meet the label's most visible star, Matt Mahaffey. (One of the few if only bands that reportedly benefited from an unsolicited demo submission to the label was Call Florence Pow, two teenage fans of Mahaffey's. The strength of their demo got them a deal with Spongebath, with Mahaffey producing their first and only album for Spongebath, "These Are the Plans".) Other bands were rumored to have lived, jammed and recorded in the Spongebath basement. 
Spongebath succeeded as a breeding ground that fed hip new bands to major labels--however, it was unable to sustain itself, and was essentially finished by 2001.
At one point or another, Spongebath employees included: Rory Daigle (manager of the Features), Bingham Barnes (bassist for indie rock darlings Glossary), Andy McLenon (who went on to work at Sire Records), Andy Kotowicz (who went on to become the Vice President of Sales and Director of Marketing for Sub Pop), Matt Meeks (eventually co-managing The Features with Daigle), Justin Meyer (who went on to play drums for Fluid Ounces), Michael Eades (who created the company's website and online presence), Neill Dietz (whose brother, Jason, would later play bass for Fluid Ounces), Chris Moon, Chris Crawford, Harrison Rogers, Christian Rocco, Joli Hummel, and several others.

John Bussy

Sir John Bussy (died 29 July 1399) of Hougham in Lincolnshire was a Member of Parliament representing Lincolnshire or Rutland eleven times from 1383 to 1398 as a Knight of the Shire. He was also Speaker of the House of Commons at the three Parliaments between 1393 and 1398, during which he supported the policies of king Richard II. He was most famous for orchestrating the abdication of parliament's power to an eighteen-man subcommittee in order to concentrate power in the hands of the king's supporters.
Executed after the fall of Richard, in later centuries Bussy (sometimes spelled "Bushy") acquired an unsavoury reputation as one of the king's three corrupt councillors "Bushy, Bagot and Green". He appears in this role in William Shakespeare's play "Richard II", as "Bushy".
Early career.
He was the son of Sir William Bussy and Isabel Paynell, the daughter of John Paynell. He married twice; firstly in 1382 to Maud Neville, daughter of Sir Philip Neville and secondly in 1398 to Mary. He owned lands in Lincolnshire.
In 1378 secured a position with John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, as the Steward of all his lands north of the Trent. He worked for the Duke until 1397 but had by then (1391) entered the service of Richard II. He was High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1383, 1385 and 1390.
Consolidation of power.
He became a close confidant and advisor of Richard and together with Sir Henry Green and Sir William Bagot became a "continual councillor". The three continual councillors went on to acquire an unsavoury reputation. Bussy became notorious for his gross flattery of the king. He was elected speaker of Parliament three times, first in 1393, and later by the two parliaments convened in 1397. It was in the latter of the two that Bussy became most notorious. He forced the parliament to delegate all its authority to a committee of which he was a member. The committee comprised eighteen members (12 Lords, 6 Commons). Each was carefully chosen as a strong supporter of Richard. By this means Bussy secured a monopoly on power by the king's supporters.
Fall and death.
When Henry Bolingbroke (King Henry IV) returned in 1399 from exile to forcibly claim his inheritance, Bussy was captured on 28 July at Bristol Castle, together with William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire and Sir Henry Green, and the next day tried and beheaded for crimes of treason against the Kingdom.

<doc id="18790860" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18790860" title="Canton Railroad Company v. Rogan">
Canton Railroad Company v. Rogan

Canton Railroad Company v. Rogan, 340 U.S. 511 (1951), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state franchise tax upon the services performed by a railroad in handling imported and exported goods did not violate the Import-Export Clause of the United States Constitution.
Background.
The Canton Railroad is an industrial switching railroad operating in the port area of Baltimore, Maryland. The State of Maryland imposed a franchise tax on the gross receipts of the railroad, apportioned based upon the percentage of the railroad trackage located within the state. A substantial portion of the freight handled by the Canton Railroad involved goods that were either being imported or exported into the United States. Canton Railroad for the tax year of 1946 claimed that $705,957.21 of its total receipts of $1,588,744.48 should be exempt from taxation because they were derived from operations in foreign commerce. The State Tax Commission rejected the railroad's claim of exemption, and imposed a tax of $39,029.34.
Canton Railroad appealed the State Tax Commission to the Baltimore City Circuit Court and then to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. The Court of Appeals upheld the imposition of the tax with two judges dissenting.
Court's decision.
The majority opinion by Justice Douglas first noted that the Import-Export Clause of the Constitution of Article One, Section 10, Clause 2 provides that
No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection Laws ...
The opinion then noted that the franchise tax was not similar to those state taxes the Supreme Court had struck down in cases that had taxed goods being exported or imported, in that this tax was a general tax on revenues from the handling of the goods and not on the goods themselves. The opinion held that to import or export involve acts that begin and end at the water's edge (country's border), and that to use the railroad's argument that it was involved in exporting and importing would create a zone of tax immunity covering nearly every forest, mine, and factory in the country. For this reasoning, the Court held that the Maryland franchise tax did not violate the Import-Export Clause. Lastly, regarding a claim that the tax violated the Commerce Clause, the Court noted that prior cases had already held that a state franchise tax structured in this manner did not violate this clause.
The dissent by Justice Jackson, styled as an opinion reserving judgment on the case, discussed the history of the Import-Export Clause as one of the fundamental policies imbedded in the Constitution. The constitutional concern was that states with ports and their associated roads would exploit this advantage, causing inland states to pay tribute to the seaboard states for the privilege of exportation. The dissent considered this federal policy to go beyond simple direct taxation on goods, and that Maryland's franchise tax had the effect of directly increasing the cost of exports. However, the dissent noted that the effect of the federal policy on the validity of the state tax was not addressed before the state courts or by the railroad company's counsel before the Supreme Court, so the Justice did not wish to express a final view on this matter. This dissenting opinion was also to apply to the companion case decided on the same day, "Western Maryland R. Co. v. Rogan", 340 U.S. 520 (1951).
Chief Justice Vinson did not take part in the consideration or decision of the case.
Subsequent developments.
The holding of "Canton Railroad" was reaffirmed when it was cited in both the majority and dissenting opinions in "United States v. International Business Machines Corp.", 517 U.S. 843 (1996), a case involving a federal tax on the insurance coverage of goods to be exported.
The Maryland franchise tax has been recodified at Section 8-101 and 8-102 of the Tax-General Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.

George Yeager

George J. "Doc" Yeager (June 5, 1874 – July 5, 1940) was a professional baseball player. He played all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball, primarily as a catcher. He played for the Boston Beaneaters from 1896 to 1899, the Cleveland Blues in 1901, the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1901, the New York Giants in 1902, and the Baltimore Orioles in 1902. During his career, he was measured at and weighing 190 lbs.
Biography.
Yeager was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Henry Yeager and the former Anna Leister. In his youth, he played on amateur baseball teams in the Cincinnati area, and after receiving several minor league offers, he signed with New Haven in 1894. For most of the next three seasons, however, he played with the Pawtucket Phenoms of the New England League. In 1896, Yeager had a good season at Pawtucket, batting .345 with 24 home runs and 36 stolen bases. He made his major league debut with the Boston Beaneaters that September.
Yeager was a backup catcher to Marty Bergen in 1897 and 1898 but also played other positions in the field for Boston. He batted .242 and then .267. Led by several future Hall of Famers, the Beaneaters won the National League pennant both years. In 1899, Boston released Yeager, and he spent most of that season with the Eastern League's Worcester Farmers. In 1900, he signed with Connie Mack's Milwaukee Brewers of the American League, which was a minor league at the time. Yeager started off hot at the plate and hit .387 through 19 games, by far the highest batting average of his career. However, he then tore some ligaments in his knee and was sidelined for the rest of 1900.
Yeager began 1901 with the Cleveland Blues, hit poorly, was released, and then finished out the season with the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1902, Yeager played for both the New York Giants and Baltimore Orioles, but he did not stick with those clubs, either. He played his last major league game on August 5, 1902.
From 1903 to 1909, Yeager was a catcher in the minor leagues. With the American Association's Minneapolis Millers, he batted over .300 for the last time in 1903. He also played for the St. Paul Saints and Toledo Mud Hens. In 1907, he went to Des Moines of the Western League and batted .286. His batting average fell to .212 the following season, and he retired soon afterwards.
After his baseball career ended, Yeager became a switch tender for the Southern Rail Road Company. He was married to Tillie Stadtlander.
Yeager died in 1940 of a cerebral hemorrhage and was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery.

Harold Mackintosh, 1st Viscount Mackintosh of Halifax

Harold Vincent Mackintosh, 1st Viscount Mackintosh of Halifax (8 June 1891 – 27 December 1964) was a British businessman, public servant and benefactor.
Early life.
Mackintosh was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, the son of John and Violet Mackintosh who had a toffee factory on "Queens Road" in Halifax, then Albion Mills and also in the United States, Canada, Germany and Australia. He was educated at Halifax New School. Instead of going to university, he spent a few years in Krefeld in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany where he ran a Mackintosh toffee factory, and learnt the language. He was a member of the German international hockey team, prior to the First World War. During the First World War, he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.
Career.
Mackintosh was the owner of the confectionery business of John Mackintosh & Sons Ltd from 1920 when his father died of a heart attack. The company John Mackintosh & Sons Ltd was floated in March 1921. He was involved in the amalgamation of a group of Halifax building societies into the Halifax Building Society in 1928. In September 1931, he narrowly avoided merging the company with Rowntrees of York. Both companies already had a joint subsidiary in the Republic of Ireland. As a result of a lunchtime meeting at the Savoy Hotel, he bought the A. J. Caley confectionery company in Norwich from Unilever in 1932. The Caleys site is now the Chapelfield shopping centre. This takeover of Caleys helped the Mackintosh company to expand its range of products notably changing its reliance on toffee to products with chocolate toffee such as "Quality Street" in 1936 and "Rolo". To launch "Quality Street", he had a full page advertisement on the front of the "Daily Mail" on 2 May 1936. His brother Eric managed the Caleys factory. He was Chairman of the National Savings Committee from 1943, becoming President in 1958. In 1956, under his leadership, National Savings introduced Premium Bonds. He served as Chancellor of the University of East Anglia between 1962 and 1964.
Recognition.
Mackintosh was knighted in 1922, when only 31, one of the youngest ever people to be knighted, for his work with Sunday schools. He was made a baronet in 1935 and raised to the peerage as Baron Mackintosh of Halifax, of Hethersett in the County of Norfolk. In 1957 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Mackintosh of Halifax, of Hethersett in the County of Norfolk. In 1948, he was given an honorary LLD by the University of Leeds. On "Unthank Road" in Norwich is "Harold Mackintosh House".
Personal life.
Lord Mackintosh of Halifax married Constance Emily Stoneham in 1916. She was born on the same day as him, and they had three children: Harold, John (born 7 October 1921) and Mary. Mackintosh was a devout Methodist. He was a keen supporter of the Sunday School Movement, becoming President of the National Sunday School Union from 3 May 1924 until 1925, then World Sunday School Association. In December 1927 he became President of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society. In 1960 he became President of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association. From 1942-6, he was President of the Advertising Association. He also supported the British Empire Cancer Campaign. He had a large collection of Toby jugs, and had an extensive knowledge of Ralph Wood and Staffordshire pottery. His son John attended an American university as he felt no British university was prepared to the necessary standard in Business Administration. From 1934-42, he lived at Conynghan Hall near Harrogate. Then they lived at "Greystones" in Luddenden. In 1947, he moved to Thickthorn Hall, south-west of Norwich. He died, aged 73, in Norwich, leaving £218,404 in his will. His wife died in 1975.
His portrait, by the famous Scottish portrait artist Cowan Dobson is held at the University of East Anglia at Norwich.

Nara, Attock

Nara (ناڑہ) is a village and union council of Jand Tehsil, Attock District, Punjab Province, Pakistan.
Location.
Nara is located 117 kilometers from Islamabad. It is situated five kilometres from the Indus River (دریائے سندھ) on the border between the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces of Pakistan.
Administration.
Nara is a union council of five other surrounding villages: Pari, Dandi Jiswal, Kundrala, Jalwal and Mari. Some of the prominent mohallahs of the village include: Mohallah Tamman, Mohallah Ziarat, Mohallah Tairha Shirqi, Mohallah Ma’ian Sehna, Mohallah Bazar, Mohallah Lunger Khana, Mohallah Imam Bargah, and Mohallah Tappa.
Demographics.
Approximately forty thousand people live in Nara. The literacy rate among village inhabitants is around 70 percent. Internet usage in the village is less than one per cent. Teledensity ratio in the village is around 75 per cent, including 5-7 per cent landline telephone subscribers.
Ethnically, Nara's inhabitants of the village can be divided into three groups: local Indians (Jats, Bhati Rajputs, and Janjua Rajputs), Arabs (Awans, Khattar, and Fatimid Syeds), and Afghans (Khattak and some Bangash Pathans). Hindko is spoken in Nara, with some Pashto. Most of the village dwellers follow Sunni Hanafi Islam. Barelvi Sunnis, Deobandi Sunnis, and Shias also live here and there are more than twenty masjids (mosques) in the village.
History.
The name of the village comes from "Nar" (نڑ), a bamboo variety common to the region. According to the Punjab Districts’ Gazetteers, Awans claimed the area after driving Janjua Rajputs out of the Salt Range.
The area was once used as an avenue for military excursions in India by various Arab, Afghan, Iranian, and Central Asian martial races. Long before that time, the area was used as a gateway for mobility between Taxila and the Central Asian states by Buddhists. Hindu traders also settled here and their remains can be found in the center of the village in the form of multi-storey buildings and some ancient Hindu temples (Dharamsaala).
During the pre-partition era, the British government of India heavily recruited army men from Nara. According to the Punjab Districts’ Gazetteers, the then-Sikh emperor of Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh convinced local chiefs of Tehsil Jand, mainly Maliks and Khans, to send armed men to crush the Mujahideen Movement, led by Syed Ahmed Shaheed in Balakot. In return, the chiefs were awarded with thousands of kanals of land and other land revenue concessions. The Muhajir community settled in Nara after the partition of India in 1947. Nara became electrified in 1964. The construction of Nara-Jand Road is attributable to Abdul Maalik, who located Indian plane hijackers during the 1970s.
Geography and climate.
The area is mainly rain-fed, with fertile land. During the 1970s there was an abundance of water in the form of lakes, flowing streams, and ponds, but the level of underground water has since gone down. Jujube (بیر) fruit trees are very common in Nara. Persian water wheels (rehat), using cows and bulls, are still in use to irrigate crops and vegetables. Some of the land is also irrigated by tube wells.
Economy.
Nara's economy is mainly agri-based. Small-scale conventional fruit farming is common. Wheat, peanut (منگ پھلی), corn, maize, millet, and pulses are some of the main crops. Livestock is another important source of income and employment in the village. Despite advancement in agricultural machinery, around one per cent of the village farmers still plough their land with the help of bulls and cows. Natural resources (oil and gas) are being extracted from the nearby Maari and Jalwal oil fields, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Nara Union Council.
Culture.
Cultural events in Nara include bull racing and observing annual urs events in the local mosques. The "berballa" is a traditional folk dance similar to the Khattak dance, and is performed by men on dhols at weddings and other festive events. A specialty of Nara is "Makhadi Halwa" (مکھڈی حلوہ), a sweet dessert.
Transportation.
Several coaches and a Toyota Hiace service connect Nara with Rawalpindi/Islamabad via the Kohat-Fateh Jang Road. A local van (vagons) transport service connects Nara with Attock city via the Kala Chitta Range.
Places of interest.
Places of interest in India include the Mohallah Ma'ian Sehna, a ruined Hindu Dharamsaal. Lorry Adda is the main bus stop in Nara. There are more than 15 government schools in Nara. Other buildings include telecom towers, a rural hospital, a postoffice, and a bank.

Hamilton's Stores (Yellowstone National Park)

Hamilton's Stores were concessioners in Yellowstone National Park from 1915 to 2002. The stores were founded by Winnipeg native Charles Hamilton, who arrived in Yellowstone in 1905, aged 21, to work for the Yellowstone Park Association. The stores provided food, souvenirs and sundries to tourists at the major attractions along Yellowstone's Grand Loop Road. Several of the buildings constructed for Hamilton's are significant examples of the National Park Service Rustic style of architecture and have assumed prominence as attractions in their own right. Most or all are included as contributing structures in National Register of Historic Places historic districts.
Charles Hamilton.
Charles Ashworth Hamilton was born in Winnipeg on November 19, 1884. His parents were Alma Lizzie Ashworth Hamilton and Charles Edward Hamilton. Alma was from Ottawa, C.E., a lawyer, was an immigrant from Kent, England. At the time of their son's birth, C.E. was mayor of Winnipeg and attorney general of Manitoba. The family moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1884, where the elder Charles had been appointed British Vice-Consul for Minnesota. After attending high school in Saint Paul, the younger Charles enrolled in a business school. This training helped him obtain a summer job in 1905 as an assistant to the purchasing agent for the Yellowstone Park Association at Mammoth Hot Springs. Hamilton spent subsequent summers as secretary to Harry W. Child, president of the Yellowstone Park Company, which operated the hotels in the park. From 1907 Hamilton was assistant to T.E. Farrow, Superintendent of Hotels. During this time, Hamilton became friends with Huntley Child Sr., son of Harry Child. In 1915 the Klamer store at Old Faithful came on the market and was offered to Huntley, who turned it down, but who informed Hamilton of the opportunity. Hamilton bought the store for $20,000 with Huntley Child's backing. Hamilton established himself at the Klamer store, which eventually became known as "Hamilton's Lower Store", in a six-room apartment on the upper floor. His office, papered with $1,839,105.60 in checks, was called the "Million Dollar Room." After Army service during World War I, Charles Hamilton married Eva Victoria Spence in 1920.
Hamilton's sisters, Alma Sybil (Syb) Hamilton Parkes, Pauline (Pearl) Hamilton Samson and Eva (Eve) Kraebel de Greve, and cousin Laura Christine Marston d'Allemagne all worked in the stores.
Expansion.
In 1916 Hamilton agreed to a 50-50 share of the automotive service concession with the Childs and opened filling stations at Old Faithful and West Thumb. Hamilton offered cooked meals in the stores from 1927.
In 1953 Hamilton gained control of most park concessions with the purchase of stores at Mammoth Hot Springs and Canyon. Hamilton also operated bathhouses at Old Faithful from 1933, when he bought the geyser-fed pool from Henry Brothers until 1951, when they were demolished as inappropriate for a national park.
As a result of a 1998 change in National Park Service policy which eliminated preferences for established businesses in parks, Hamilton's Stores lost the concessions contract in Yellowstone to Delaware North in 2002, and ceased operations.

BAALC

BAALC ("Brain and Acute Leukemia, Cytoplasmic")is a gene that has been associated with acute myeloid leukemia. The gene is conserved among mammals and is not found in lower organisms. Tissues that express this gene develop from the neuroectoderm. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different proteins have been described for this gene; however, some of the transcript variants are found only in AML cell lines. Among patients with acute myeloid leukemia, those overexpressing BAALC show distinctly poor prognosis, pointing to a key role of the BAALC products in leukemia. Some sources suggest that BAALC is a gene implicated in both neuroectodermal and hematopoietic cell functions.

Fred Entertainment

Fred Entertainment (formerly Movie Poop Shoot and later Quick Stop Entertainment) is a pop-culture website. The site was founded as Movie Poop Shoot by director Kevin Smith to promote the 2001 movie "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back". The site served as the launching pad for SModcast, Smith's popular comedy podcast. In early 2010, Smith released control of the site over to editor Ken Esteban Plume, who re-branded the site as Fred Entertainment.
Quick Stop Entertainment became Fred Entertainment on January 1, 2010. It was taken over and is now owned by Ken Plume, former editor of Quick Stop Entertainment.
History.
Quick Stop Entertainment's original incarnation as "MoviePoopShoot.com" was set up as a parody of websites such as "Ain't It Cool News", and was featured in "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back".
The site began producing editorial content on June 17, 2002 under editor Chris Ryall. Ryall ran the website for four years until 2005, when he left for IDW Publishing. In May 2006, the site was named Quick Stop Entertainment after the hiring of new editor Ken Plume, one of the founding members of IGN FilmForce.
The site's staff also makes appearances at fan-conventions, and in 2008 hosted a panel at Dragon Con, in Atlanta, Georgia in 2008 which featured the members of Snydecast and Cabin Fever. Quick Stop also co-hosts the Gonzo Film Festival (founded by Ken Plume and Widgett Walls in 2003) with needcoffee.com on the Saturday of the event.
In 2008, Ken Plume created the online songwriting contest, "The Masters of Song Fu." The contest is described as a songwriting version of Iron Chef, the competitors are presented with a very specific songwriting challenge. They are given one week to complete their songs - however they see fit, within the parameters set forth - after which time the entries are voted on by the public. After three preliminary rounds, the challenger who has received the most votes goes head to head against one of the "Masters of Song Fu" in a single song battle. This song is also voted on by the public and the winner is crowned the "Master of Song Fu!" Masters of Song Fu is now a regular feature of ASiteCalledFRED.com.
The winners of Song Fu were:
One: Jonathan Coulton, Two: The RiffTones (from RiffTrax),
Three: Molly Lewis, Four: Berg & Jerry, Five: Joe Covenant Lamb, Six: Mike Lombardo. Some other notable former Song Fu competitors include; Paul and Storm, Garfunkel and Oates and Neil Innes who wrote what he subtitled 'Ron Nasty's Last Song for the competition. There were also two Song Fu 'Specials': The Holiday Special, for which Paul and Storm wrote an exclusive track, and the Red Nose Day Special.
In 2010, Bagged & Boarded became a live show at Kevin Smith's SModCastle.

Darius Cobb

Darius Cobb (August 6, 1834 – April 23, 1919) was a noted American painter. Cobb was considered to be one of America's best painters during his lifetime, as well as a painter of society portraits, landscape, religious themes and historical costumes. He was also noted as a musician, singer, poet, lecturer, lithographer, and art critic.
Biography.
Born in the old Ralph Waldo Emerson House in Malden, Massachusetts, Darius Cobb was a descendant of Henry Cobb of Kent, England, who came to Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1629 on the ship "Anne". Darius and his twin brother Cyrus were the sons of the Reverend Sylvanus and Eunice Hale (Waite) Cobb. The Cobb twins had an older brother, Sylvanus Cobb, Jr., who became a noted author in the late 19th century and wrote as a columnist for the "New York Ledger". Eunice Hale (Waite) Cobb, the mother of Darius and Cyrus, founded the first women's club in America, the Ladies Physiological Institute, which promoted health and fitness.
Darius Cobb first received his education through public schools, then, with his twin brother, Cyrus (1834–1903), he attended the Lyman School of East Boston. In the course of his later studies, he and his brother Cyrus studied classics under Professor I. N. Eyers, mathematics at the Norway Liberal Institute in Maine, and oratory under Wyzeman Marshall, while at the same time studying music, art and literature. Darius eventually graduated with high honors from Boston Latin School.
Family life.
On January l, 1866, the twin brothers were married by their father in a double wedding ceremony to sisters; Cyrus to Emma Lillie and Darius to Laura Marie Lillie. The two girls were lineal descendants of John Alden of Pilgrim fame. Darius and his wife had seven children, including four daughters: Lillie Alden, Cora Stanwood, Estelle Marcy and Edith Harriet; and three sons, Stanwood, Percival Bartlett and Frederick Walter. Of those children, Frederick resided in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts, and was shipping agent for the Pettee Machine Works. His home was on Rockland Place in the old John A. Gould House. Cyrus and his wife had five children, including three daughters, Grace, Elsie, and Florence, and two sons, Francis S. and Ernest. Ernest purchased the old Cunningham estate on Richardson Road in 1918 from which he and his wife, Bertha, successfully operated the Arlo Publishing Company which featured children's books.
For a time the brothers lived side by side, Cyrus at 1129 and Darius at 1134 Boylston Street. The fame of the two families led to Bolyston Street Hill being known as Cobb's Hill for many years. Later, Darius moved to 127A Tremont, the address he was listed at when his biography appeared in the 1918 Marquis Who's Who. In that same Who's Who volume, Cyrus is listed as having his art studio at the same address: 127A Tremont Street, Boston.
Eventually, Darius moved his family to Newton Upper Falls in the early 1880s, where he resided for the rest of his life.
A career in art.
Though Darius would become the more famous of the two brothers, Cyrus enjoyed national fame, too. Cyrus Cobb practiced law for six years but later devoted full-time to the arts of painting and sculpturing. Cyrus predominantly chose sculpture and Darius painting. Both Cobb brothers spent the greater part of their careers in Boston. In their art work their great instructor was Nature. They also received instruction from a relative and pupil of Washington Allston, who imparted to them in their youth many valuable ideas of that master. Cyrus' paintings were of a historical nature and included portraits of General U. S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln and a canvas entitled "Warren at the Old South" which is hung at the Old South Meeting House in Boston. He also delved into etchings. Cyrus Cobb's two best-known public sculptures are the Soldier's Monument (co-created with brother Darius) on the Cambridge Common and the full-length portrayal of Paul Revere at Boston. His design for the Soldier's Monument was selected from about 40 other entries. His sculptured pieces also included a head entitled "The Celtic Bard", a heroic bas-relief "Prospero and Miranda", a bust of General Butler, a bust of Phillips Brooks and one of local interest, that of Reverend Samuel Francis Smith, author of the patriotic hymn "America". This latter piece was placed in the State House. Cyrus Cobb also wrote and illustrated "Sonnets to the Masters of Art". He was a full member of the Boston Art Club.
In 1862 the brothers enlisted in the 44th Massachusetts Infantry, doing service in North Carolina for nine months. In 1870, the two brothers co-authored a book titled "The Veteran of the Grand Army", based on their war experiences. Their Civil War service gave them an edge in the design competition for the Cambridge Soldiers Monument, dedicated in 1870. The figure of a soldier at the top of the monument was their first life-size sculpture.
He had the soldier's hat, the worn knapsack, the dented canteen. But when Darius Cobb set out in the 1870s to make a still-life lithograph of Civil War artifacts, he was missing one important element - a tin cup. So, tacked onto the wall in the trompe-l'œil rendering is a scrap of paper with a sketched outline and the words "Dipper Missing". "Each painting has a story like this," said Susan Abele, curator of "Rediscovering Newton Artists, 1850-1950", at the Newton History Museum at the Jackson Homestead.
Darius was art editor/critic of the "Boston Traveler", 1872–79, and became prominent in musical and literary circles and on the lecture platform.
Later in life the Cobb brothers worked together on a series of paintings illustrating French history for Boston's Tuileries Apartment Hotel. While Cyrus eventually became an accomplished sculptor, Darius was best known for his landscapes and portraits. His portrait of Ralph Waldo Emerson hung in the Emerson School in Newton Upper Falls for many years. However, it was religious paintings for which Darius Cobb would become better known. His first significant religious work was entitled "Judas", followed by "Christ Before Pilate", "Abraham", and a magnificent head of Christ called "The Master". This painting was completed in 1917 when the artist was 83 years of age. He had worked on it for 34 years before considering it finished. Unfortunately, a few years after his death it was destroyed in a fire.
Around 1868 he painted the portrait of Henry Wilson, the U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, 1855–1873, who was then Vice President of the United States under Ulysses S. Grant. This work hangs in the Morse Institute Library in Natick, Massachusetts. In 1881, Cobb was hired to paint a series of pictures titled "Site of the Boston Medical Library in 1881". Today, this series of paintings are in the collection of the Harvard Medical Library. In 1877, Cobb produced an oil on canvas portrait of Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner. In 1890, Cobb painted a portrait of Civil War General Benjamin Butler at the State House in Concord, New Hampshire. That painting was reproduced as the frontispiece engraving in Butler's autobiography, "Butler's Book", which was published in 1892.
Among Darius' more noted pictures are portraits of Louis Agassiz (1875) and Rufus Choate (1876); "King Lear" (1877); "Judas in the Potter's Field" (1877); "Christ Before Pilate" (1878); "For Their Sakes" (1879); "Washington on Dorchester Heights" (1880); portraits of Gen. B. F. Butler (1889),and Rev. Phillips Brooks (1893); "Immortality" (1893); and portraits of John A. Andrew (1894) and Charles P. Clark (1897).
In 1897, assisted by his brother Cyrus, he decorated the walls of the banquet hall of the Tuileries, Boston, with panels illustrative of French history. Of the nine panels he painted six: "Jeanne d'Arc"; "An Intrigue in the Court of Louis XIII"; "Richelieu and the Mayor of Rochelle "; "A Troublesome Edict of Louis XIV"; "The Storming of the Tuileries"; and "The Downfall of the Second Empire."
In 1898 he painted two large pictures for the town hall at Revere, Massachusetts, the subjects being scenes in the ride of Paul Revere. Cobb's work managed to find life on a postcard, too. According to "The Town Crier" (Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts) for May 5, 1911, 10,000 postal cards printed with Cobb's painting of the "Last Comrade's Final Tribute" were circulated throughout the United States.
Legacy.
Though Cobb was considered to be one of America's better historical painters during his lifetime, his work has not received much attention since his death in 1919. Still, his legacy lives on, as many of his finest pieces are included among many important collections, with specific works on display at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio, and the State House in Concord, New Hampshire. Other works on display include "Washington at Dorchester Heights", which was hung in the Memorial Continental Hall in Washington; "The Old Drummer of the Revolution", which was placed in the Old State House in Boston; the "Boston Tea Party", which was hung in the hall of the Ancients and Honorables; and "The Death of Cuchullan", which is on display at Boston College. According to "The Autobiography of William Sanders Scarborough", Cobb's paintings also hung in art galleries in England and France.

Hurricane Hernan (2008)

Hurricane Hernan was the ninth tropical depression, eighth named storm, fifth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. Hernan developed out of a tropical wave that formed off the east coast of Africa on July 24. Over the next week, the wave traversed the Atlantic without development and entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2. The wave became better organized over the next several days and was declared Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 6. The depression quickly became Tropical Storm Hernan later that day. Hernan steadily intensified over the next two days and was upgraded to a hurricane on the morning of August 8. Hernan continued to intensify and became the first major hurricane—a storm with winds of 111 mph (178 km/h) or higher—of the season on August 9. After reaching major hurricane status, Hernan steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane. The weakening continued, and Hernan was further downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11. As Hernan moved over cold waters, the convection associated with the storm dissipated, leaving only a swirl of clouds. By the morning of August 12, almost all of the convection associated with Hernan had dissipated and the system was declared a remnant low-pressure area. The remnants of the hurricane caused light rain to Hawaii.
Origins.
On July 24, a tropical wave emerged from the east coast of Africa, near the Cape Verde Islands. The wave was disorganized and failed to develop convection as it traversed the Atlantic Ocean| over the next several days. The wave eventually entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2, and interacted with a broad area of cyclonic flow located a few hundred miles south of Mexico. The wave became better organized throughout the day, and an area of low pressure formed 660 mi (1060 km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico on August 5. Strong convection began to develop. That day, a banding feature formed On the morning of August 6, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued. Later in the day, the National Hurricane Center determined that the system had developed sufficient convection to be declared Tropical Depression Nine-E while located 775 mi (1230 km) to the south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur. However, the storm was operationally believed to have become a depression several hours later.
Tropical Depression Nine-E was influenced by a high pressure area located over Mexico, causing it to move 16 mph (26 km/h) to the north-west. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hernan overnight as the storm became more organized. Although Hernan was located over warm waters, moderate wind shear prevented the storm from intensifying quickly, and the storm slwoed. Hernan slowly became better organized throughout the night, but wind shear continued to impair Hernan through the morning; as a result, most of the tropical cyclone forecast models did not predict Hernan to become a hurricane.
Intensification and peak strength.
In the early afternoon, an eye feature began to form; subsequently, Hernan was nearing hurricane status. However, by the nighttime hours, a microwave satellite found that the center of Hernan was located to the west-southwest of the eye feature, and the intensification ceased for the rest of the day and into the morning of August 8. Later in the morning, the center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath the eye and was determined to have become a hurricane, the fifth of the season, during the afternoon of August 8. Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish. Despite a cloud-filled eye, meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a Category 2 hurricane overnight.
Early on August 9, Hernan was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). Convection around the eye continued become more symmetrical, though the National Hurricane Center had stated that Hernan had most likely reached its peak intensity or was very close to doing so. However, the eye suddenly became better defined. Based on this, Hernan was upgraded to a major hurricane. The intensity of Hernan was uncertain, as there was some difference between intensity estimates. Hernan maintained its appearance through the evening and it was stated that the peak intensity of the storm may have been 125 mph (205 km/h). Overnight, Hernan moved over cooler waters and started to weaken. Although the eye remained well defined, outflow to all the southwestern semicircle became poor.
Weakening and dissipation.
Hernan rapidly weakened overnight and was barely a Category 2 in the afternoon hours of August 10 as it moved over cooler waters. The erosion of the eyewall was later found to be caused by an eyewall replacement cycle that rapidly completed itself during the afternoon. Continuing to slowly weaken, Hernan was soon downgraded to a strong Category 1. The newly formed eye began to shrink and deteriorate through the early afternoon, but Hernan briefly stopped weakening. Initially, Hernan's strong circulation allowed it to maintain hurricane status over 24°C waters.
Early on August 11, Hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm. Deep convection diminished around the center of the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460 mi (740 km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.

Denver and Rio Grande Depot (Montrose, Colorado)

The Denver and Rio Grande Depot, also known as the Montrose Railroad Depot, is a historic railway station in Montrose, Colorado. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and currently houses a historical museum.
History.
The Denver and Rio Grande Railway first reached Montrose in 1882, and by 1885, it was described as the "most important station west of Gunnison City". The current depot was built sometime between 1908 and 1912, replacing a previous facility. The station served both passengers and freight. The railway branched south out of Montrose to Ouray and the Rio Grande Southern Railroad, and it branched east to Gunnison and Crested Butte.
The depot was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural and transportation significance; it was listed on June 3, 1982. Beginning circa 1980, the depot has housed the Montrose County Historical Museum. Part of the building has also been rented to the Continental Trailways bus system.
Architecture and setting.
The depot is located in downtown Montrose, and is described as an "architectural bright spot". It has a Mission Revival design, characterized by the arcades, terra cotta tile roof, and curvilinear parapets. It is a one-story structure, approximately rectangular, with main facades along the east (street side) and west (track side). Two chimneys protrude from the roof. The lower of the exterior is concrete with a wainscot appearance, above which is rough concrete stucco.
A spur track used to exist to the south of the station, since replaced by a parking lot.

Wheeler's October 1863 Raid

Wheeler's October 1863 Raid (October 1–9, 1863) was a large cavalry raid in southeastern Tennessee during the American Civil War. Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's Confederate cavalry scored a great initial success, but subsequently was roughed up by Union cavalry during its withdrawal south of the Tennessee River.
Background.
After being defeated in the Battle of Chickamauga, the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, withdrew into the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and was besieged by Gen. Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. The Federals held a railhead at Bridgeport, Alabama, but because Bragg's army occupied Lookout Mountain, they had to bring supplies into the beleaguered city by wagon. The routes along the Tennessee River were easily harassed by the Confederates, so Rosecrans had to bring most of his supplies into Chattanooga from Bridgeport along a 60-mile wagon route across Walden's Ridge. Bragg ordered Wheeler to take the bulk of his cavalry corps and disrupt Rosecrans's communications across Walden's Ridge.
Anderson's Cross Roads.
Wheeler set out on October 1 with the divisions of Brig. Gen. Frank Crawford Armstrong and Maj. Gen. William T. Martin, plus part of Maj. Gen. John A. Wharton's division. He quickly broke through the screen of Brig. Gen. George Crook's 2nd Cavalry Division near Decatur, Tennessee, and rode toward Walden's Ridge. On October 2 at Anderson's Cross Roads, Wheeler surprised a train of 800 mule-drawn wagons, plus sutler's wagons. The Southern horsemen easily overwhelmed the few guards and began to carry out their orders to "kill the mules and burn the wagons." Soon, whiskey was discovered in the sutler's wagons and Wheeler's men began pillaging the wagons for new clothing and other booty. The officers were either unwilling or unable to stop what became an eight hour orgy of plundering. 
Soon, Col. Edward M. McCook arrived with his brigade of Union cavalry. In a series of skirmishes, McCook lost 70 men while recapturing 800 mules and a few wagons and inflicting 270 losses on the tipsy Southerners. Wharton rode to McMinnville, Tennessee, which was captured with a loss of 388 Federals and 23 Confederates. Meanwhile, Crook was able to deflect Wheeler's main body away from the supply base at Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
Farmington.
By October 7, Brig. Gen. Robert Byington Mitchell concentrated McCook and Crook at Shelbyville, Tennessee. That day, Crook mauled Henry B. Davidson's brigade of Wharton near Farmington, losing 75 Federals while inflicting a loss of 310. The pursuit continued in foul weather as some elements of Union cavalry rode as many as 57 miles. Wheeler escaped across the Tennessee River on October 9 at Rogersville, Alabama, but not before another 95 of his horsemen were overwhelmed near Pulaski, Tennessee.
Aftermath.
Wheeler inflicted significant damage to the Army of the Cumberland's supply line. He destroyed 500 wagons by Rosecrans's estimate and claimed killing 1,000 mules. However, during the pursuit, his command was badly roughed up by the Union horsemen, "his once proud command all but wrecked." In the face of the aggressive Northern cavalry, Brig. Gen. Phillip Roddey cut short his follow up raid. Another planned cavalry raid by Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Lee was canceled after he found out that Wheeler's command was no longer in the field.

Passer Angelfish

The Passer Angelfish or King Angelfish ("Holacanthus passer") is a large marine angelfish of the family Pomacanthidae. Due to its large size and bright colors it is a popular aquarium fish, despite the fact that it can be difficult to keep.
Distribution.
The Passer Angelfish is a non-migratory tropical fish that inhabits reefs in the eastern Pacific ocean from the coast of Peru north to the California gulf, including offshore islands as far west as the Galapagos, generally at a depth of between . 
Physical description.
Passer Angelfish are sexually isomorphic, meaning males and females are visually identical on the outside. They do, however undergo significant changes in coloration and to a lesser degree shape as they mature.
Juvenile Passer Angelfish are primarily yellow, with iridescent-blue-rimmed fins and blue striping towards the posterior of their bodies, and an orange mask around the eye. Sexually mature Passer Angelfish, on the other hand, have mostly brown or blue bodies (depending on the light) with the same blue rimming around the fins and a yellow dorsal fin. 
Passer Angelfish generally grow to 35 or 35 cm long. They have between 18 to 20 rays in their dorsal fin and each of their pectoral fins, and 17 to 19 in their anal fin. They also have a strong spike under their lower cheek for defensive purposes.
Habitat and diet.
Passer Angelfish primarily inhabit the middle and bottom of the water column of rocky tropical reefs, including in the larger crevices between rocks, and juveniles can occasionally be found in tide pools. They are diurnal and feed on sponges, other sessile invertebrates, zooplankton, and certain species of benthic microalgae.
In aquaria.
Passer Angelfish are somewhat popular as aquarium fish, however their large size, specialized diet, and prohibitive cost make them comparatively poor captive pets. They have not bred in captivity and hence can be very difficult to find in most hobby shops, although they are slightly more available through mail order companies, for a price.
Passer Angelfish also have a well-deserved reputation for being difficult to keep, largely because they require sponges and tunicates as a food source and will often not accept even prepared foods with such things as ingredients. Besides their diet, they are not particularly picky about salinity or pH, so long as they are kept stable and the water quality high.
Angelfish in general are not generally good community inhabitants, Passer Angels being no exception. If introduced when young, a lucky aquarist may be able to keep two angels in one appropriately size aquarium, but such experiences tend to be the exception, not the norm. Passer Angelfish are quite dominant and can be abusive to smaller or more docile tankmates, or Angelfish that are lower on the social hierarchy for whatever reason.
Reproduction.
Passer Angelfish are monogamous within their pairs and, during their spawning cycle, will mate daily around sunset. During a spawning cycle a pair can produce upwards of ten million fertilized eggs, averaging about 25–75,000 daily. These eggs then drift in the water column for about 20 hours, at which point they hatch. After hatching, the fin-less fry live off their yolk sack until it is completely absorbed, at which point they begin to eat small zooplankton.

Caleb Baldwin

Caleb Ramsbottom (born April 22, 1769 in Westminster, England — died November 8, 1827), aka Caleb Baldwin, was a premiere lightweight boxer of the bare-knuckle era in England.
Professional career.
Baldwin's first recorded organized prize fight took place in 1786, when he bested a London porkpickler named Jim Gregory. Later that year, English boxing champion Tom Johnson saw Baldwin fighting another man and became his patron. Johnson funded Baldwin's next fight, against highly regarded Arthur "Gypsy" Smith, a bout Baldwin dominated.
During the years following the win against Smith, Baldwin, now known as "The Pride of Westminster," established himself as the leading small fighter in England and was regarded by many, unofficially, as the champion of the division. In 1792 he fought to a draw against Paddington Tom Jones. In 1804, Baldwin was matched with Dutch Sam, a future hall of famer who was also making a name for himself at the same time. Baldwin was the bigger man and used this to his advantage, but tired in the later rounds until the fight was stopped in Sam's favor after thirty-seven rounds. This was the only known loss of Baldwin's career.
Baldwin fought just twice more, both draws, over the next several years and retired in 1816 with a 13-1-1 record.
Death.
Baldwin died on November 8, 1827 at age 58 in London, England.
Honors.
Baldwin has been elected to the IBHOF.

The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) is a monthly report published by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) providing comprehensive forecast of supply and demand for major crops (global and United States) and livestock (U.S. only). The report provides an analysis of the fundamental condition of the agricultural commodity markets for the use of farmers, governments and other market participants. 
The WASDE report is compiled using information from a number of statistical reports produced by the USDA and other government agencies. It is widely considered to be the benchmark to which all other private and public agricultural forecasts are compared.
The recent releases of the WASDE report provide forecasts covering:
The WASDE report is generally released between the 8th and 12th of each month at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. It is available in electronic form (as a PDF or text file) and can be downloaded from the USDA website from the time of release. Subscription to the report can be made through the "Albert R. Mann Library" for delivery by e-mail shortly after release on the Internet. As a work of the United States government, the WASDE reports are released into the public domain in accordance with U.S. copyright law, .
History.
Predecessor publications date back to the 19th century. In 1893, the USDA Division of Statistics published "Production and distribution of the principal agricultural products of the world", a miscellaneous report representing several months of work in compiling the first overview of production of major crops around the world. Subsequent such reports appeared irregularly, and evolved by the 1960s into commodity-oriented circulars published at regular intervals by USDA agencies. 
The first direct predecessor of the WASDE report was released on September 17, 1973, as the "Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates". It was originally focused on supply, demand and trade in the United States. On October 14, 1980, the report was released for the first time as the "World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates" and it was the first report to provide categorized estimates for the world, U.S., total foreign, major importers and major exporters. Estimates for individual countries were first included in the report released on January 11, 1985.

Pedro Pizarro

Pedro Pizarro (c. 1515 – c. 1602) was a Spanish chronicler and conquistador. He took part in most events of the Spanish conquest of Peru and wrote an extensive chronicle of them under the title "Relación del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Perú" ("Relation of the discovery and conquest of the kingdoms of Peru"), which he finished in 1571.
Biography.
Pedro Pizarro was born around 1515 in the Spanish city of Toledo. Through his father he was first cousin of Francisco Pizarro and his half-brothers: Gonzalo Pizarro, Hernando Pizarro, Juan Pizarro and Martín de Alcántara. When Francisco left Spain for his third expedition to Peru he was joined by his brothers and his cousin Pedro. They sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda on February 1530 and arrived at Tumbes in what is now Peru on January 1531. Pedro initially served as page to his cousin Francisco but from about 1533 he was in active military service as a cavalryman. As such he took part in most of the chief events of the conquest of the Inca empire, mainly during the campaigns against Manco Inca.
Pedro Pizarro fought at the Battle of Las Salinas (April 26, 1538) against Diego de Almagro, rival and former partner of Francisco Pizarro. He then took part in the foundation of the city of Arequipa (August 15, 1540) where he established himself. The "almagristas" revolted again in 1541, murdering Francisco Pizarro, so Pedro Pizarro fought them at the Battle of Chupas (September 16, 1542) under the command of Cristóbal Vaca de Castro. When Gonzalo Pizarro revolted against the Spanish Crown, Pedro Pizarro refused his requests to join his rebellion. However, his loyalty was put in doubt for a letter he wrote to his cousin on December 18, 1546, which shows some vacillations in his loyalty probably prompted by material considerations. This letter fell into the hands of Pedro de la Gasca, an envoy sent by the Crown to pacify the country. La Gasca used the letter as an excuse to deny Pedro Pizarro the rewards he claimed after the Battle of Xaquixaguana (April 9, 1548) where Gonzalo Pizarro was defeated.
Despite this rebuff, Pedro Pizarro could be considered a rich and well-rewarded man. On November 28, 1538, he had received from Francisco Pizarro lands and native workers in Arequipa, Tacna and other regions; he received further grants from time to time by various authorities. When he was very young, he fathered a natural daughter, Isabel Pizarro; he later had numerous legitimate children. Pedro Pizarro married twice: his first wife was María Cornejo, but nothing is known about his second wife. The death date of Pedro Pizarro is not known. It happened after 1571 when he finished writing his chronicle and could have taken place as late as 1602 when viceroy Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas made a grant to a Pedro Pizarro, however, this Pedro may have been a son of the chronicler.
Pizarro's "Relación".
Based on his personal observation from 1531 to 1555, Pedro Pizarro wrote a chronicle of the Spanish conquest of Peru, which he completed in 1571 under the title "Relación del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Perú" ("Relation of the discovery and conquest of the kingdoms of Peru"). The manuscript of "Relación" that was at the National Library of Spain, however, been lost and the only remaining copy is located at The Huntington Library. The work remained in manuscript until its inclusion in the fifth volume of the "Colección de documentos inéditos para la historia de España", published in 1844 in Madrid. The first English translation was published by Philip A. Means in 1921 in New York; the standard modern edition in Spanish is that edited by Guillermo Lohmann Villena in 1978 in Lima.

Armenian Mirror-Spectator

The Armenian Mirror-Spectator is a newspaper published by the Baikar Association, in Watertown, Massachusetts.
"The Armenian Mirror.
The origins of the newspaper goes to 1931. The original raison d'être for the newspaper was to create a vehicle to bridge the growing generation gap between Armenian-Americans since the 1920s. Thus, the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party (ADL) also commonly known as the Ramgavar Party determined at its 1931 convention to establish an English-language Armenian weekly as an organ to the party and to be called The Armenian Mirror alongside the Armenian-language daily newspaper and official organ "Baikar" that was being published since 1922. 
The Boston-based "Armenian Mirror" published in Watertown, Massachusetts was launched on July 1, 1932, with Yeghishe B. Chakrian as the founding editor.
"The Spectator".
The Spectator was a New York-based English-language Armenian independent newspaper not affiliated with any Armenian political party. Founded in 1933, its editor in chief was John Tashjian.
"The Armenian Mirror-Spectator".
In 1939, with the onslaught of the World War II, New York's "The Spectator" merged into the Boston-based "Armenian Mirror" ceasing publishing from New York. 
The resulting merger formed Armenian Mirror-Spectator that continued as an organ of the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party (ADL).

Sherman, Texas bus accident

A bus chartered by Vietnamese pilgrims crashed in Texas on Friday 8 August 2008, killing at least 17 people and injuring dozens more, police said. The bus, carrying 55 people, drove off an overpass bridge of northbound U.S. 75 shortly after midnight and crashed near the town of Sherman, Texas, some 64 miles (103 kilometers) north of Dallas.
Sherman police said a blown tire on the bus may have caused the driver to lose control. Local media said that the group was from the Vietnamese Martyrs' Church, Our Lady of Lavang, and Our Lady of Lourdes of Houston, Texas. The bus was one of three buses carrying Vietnamese Catholics on their way to the annual Marian Days celebration in Carthage, Missouri in honor of the Virgin Mary. The bus tire was apparently recapped; the bus charter company had a history of safety violations, and the driver had a criminal record. The bus owner was identified as Iguala BusMex Inc.
Following the crash, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration temporarily stopped issuing new bus company licenses.
The bus did not have seat belts. Some people have called for mandatory seat belts and safety glass in highway coaches.

Crescencio Poot

Crescencio Poot (1820–1885) was a leading general in the Caste War of Yucatán.
Life as a rebel.
He began raids on white-owned haciendas in 1864. In the next several years his troops would raid, but rarely occupy, various villages. This meant generally avoiding government troops, but he did achieve a major victory in the Yucatán. At one point, Bernardino Cen, the commander of the rebel army, killed his two sons in a drunken rage and was temporarily replaced by Poot. Later he became one of the rebellions "three chiefs" and ultimately considered peace with the Mexicans. 
He married a woman named Maria D. Aldrete. He was captured during a raid in 1874. His wife, Maria, fearful that the government might use her and her children to coherce her husband, sent her three children away. It is believed her children took her maiden name and fled to Texas or deep into Mexico. In 1878, he was released and began raids again. In 1879, He married a woman he captured in a raid. A few years later, Poot would become the Chan Santa Cruz general in charge of making major decisions and organizing raids and skirmishes.
Negotiations in 1883 led to a treaty signed on January 11, 1884 in Belize City by a Chan Santa Cruz general and the vice-Governor of Yucatán recognizing Mexican sovereignty over Chan Santa Cruz in exchange for Mexican recognition of Chan Santa Cruz leader Crescencio Poot as Governor of the State of Chan Santa Cruz, but the following year there was a coup d'état in Chan Santa Cruz, and the treaty was declared cancelled. Poot was executed in early 1885.

The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington

The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington are two closely related Elizabethan-era stage plays on the Robin Hood legend, that were written by Anthony Munday (possibly with help from Henry Chettle) in 1598 and published in 1601. They are among the relatively few surviving examples of the popular drama acted by the Admiral's Men during the Shakespearean era.
Scholars and critics have studied the plays for their place in the evolution of the Robin Hood legend. Munday has been credited as the first person to identify Robin Hood with the Earl of Huntingdon.
Publication.
Both plays were entered into the Stationers' Register on 1 December 1600, and were printed in separate quartos in the next year by stationer William Leake. The 1601 quartos were the only editions in the era of English Renaissance theatre; the plays would not be reprinted until the nineteenth century.
Leake's 1601 quartos employ a blackletter or Gothic typeface for the speeches in the plays, with a Roman font used for stage directions and speech prefixes.
Authorship.
The plays were originally published anonymously; the 1601 quartos lack any attribution of authorship on their title pages. The account book of theatrical manager Philip Henslowe (known as Henslowe's Diary) records a payment, dated 15 February 1598, to "Antony Monday" for "a playe booke called the firste parte of Robyne Hoode." The Diary records subsequent payments to Munday on 20 and 28 February the same year for "the second pte of Roben Hoode." Given the plays' general resemblances with Munday's earlier drama "John a Kent and John a Cumber" (c. 1594), scholars have had no problem in accepting Munday's authorship.
Henslowe's Diary also records a payment, dated 25 February 1598, to Henry Chettle for "the second pte of Robart hoode." Chettle was later (25 November 1598) paid for "mending" a Robin Hood play for a Court performance. Based on these facts, many scholars have assigned "The Death" to Munday and Chettle as collaborators. Comparing "The Death" to Munday's "John a Kent" on one hand and to Chettle's "Hoffman" on the other, some critics have considered Munday the likely author of the Robin Hood material in "The Death", and Chettle the probable author of the story of King John's pursuit of Matilda Fitzwater.
Yet John C. Meagher, editor of the Malone Society reprints of the plays, argues that the case for Chettle's participation in the play's authorship is weak. In his judgement, "The Downfall" is the work of Munday alone, and "The Death" is also "either primarily or exclusively the work of Munday."
"Foul papers".
For both of the 1601 quartos, the texts were set into type from the author's working drafts or "foul papers" rather than from "fair copies" of the finished texts or from theatrical promptbooks. Both plays contain major discontinuities that would have been corrected in their final versions.
All of these difficulties would have to have been resolved in the plays' finished texts.
Genre.
This view of "The Downfall" and "The Death" as, to some significant degree, unfinished works in their existing texts, has a bearing on perceptions of the plays' artistic quality and their deficiencies. In Munday's Robin Hood plays, "Motivation is scanty, inner conflict is barely hinted at, and qualities are painted in with primary colors...not much attention is paid to cause and effect. Intrigues are begun and quickly forgotten, important episodes seem to be omitted completely, and diversions frequently have precedence over any logical sequence of events." 
Some of these problems could have been remedied or at least palliated in the final versions. Yet some of these traits are inherent in the dramatic form and genre in which Munday worked. The plays "have been strongly criticized as unsatisfactory mixtures of folk tale, melodrama, and farce," when they should be considered as "primarily romances" — "not chronicle plays nor pastoral comedy mixed with tragedy of blood..." As romances, comparable to the romances of Robert Greene and to Shakespeare's late plays, the Munday works show more sense and coherence.
To a substantial degree, the two works form a single whole, a "two-part play." Like other works of this type, Munday's double play employs a dichotomy of dramatic forms: the first part moves "in a comic direction," or "at least toward reconciliation," while the second bends "in a tragic direction."
Other plays.
The story of Robin Hood was integral to English folklore, and Munday was far from the first or only dramatist of his time to exploit it. The most prominent Robin Hood play of Munday's era was "George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield", registered in 1595 and printed in 1599. This anonymous work has often been attributed to Robert Greene. The anonymous "Look About You" (1599?; printed 1600) also features Robin Hood; one researcher has ascribed it to Munday, or Chettle, or both.
An early Robin Hood play, author unknown, was printed in 1560. An anonymous "Robin Hood and Little John" (1594) has not survived. William Haughton worked on a "Robin Hood's Pennyworths" around 1600, but apparently left it unfinished.
In turn, Robert Davenport based his later play "King John and Matilda" (published 1655) securely on "The Death." Some critics have called Davenport's play a mere rewriting of Munday's.
During the Restoration, a drama titled "Robin Hood and His Crew of Soldiers" was acted at Nottingham on the day of King Charles II's coronation.
Admiral's drama.
In Shakespeare's generation, the Admiral's Men were the primary competitors with Shakespeare's company, the Lord Chamberlain's/King's Men. In the years from 1594 to 1602, the two companies were the only ones allowed permanent residence in London. The Admiral's Men performed two early works by George Chapman, and Thomas Middleton's "The Roaring Girl"; most of their plays, though, were written by a coterie of house playwrights, regularly employed by manager Henslowe. These writers sometimes collaborated in teams of three, four, or even five per play. Henslowe's Diary preserves the titles of dozens of plays written by Chettle, Haughton, Thomas Dekker, John Day, Michael Drayton, Richard Hathwaye, and others. A huge body of this work has disappeared, lost to history; out of the thirty plays Henslowe ordered from his house dramatists in 1598, only Munday's Huntington plays survive. Along with a few other survivors, like "Sir John Oldcastle" or Haughton's "Englishmen for My Money", they illustrate what a whole style of drama was like.

Chris Taub

Christopher Michael "Chris" Taub, M.D., is a fictional character on the Fox medical drama "House". He is portrayed by Peter Jacobson. He becomes a member of House's new diagnostic team in the Season 4 episode titled "Games".
Professional life.
Taub is a plastic surgeon and was #39 during the "games" used by House to select his new team. House almost fired Taub (and the row he was sitting in) on the first day of the games, but Taub was saved when House changed his mind after noticing an attractive woman in the group. He also reveals himself as the most willing of the applicants to challenge House's authority, even telling a patient's father that he thinks House is wrong and can have him removed from the case ("Ugly"). Cuddy later favors Taub as one of her two choices for the team, arguing that his knowledge and combative nature would keep House focused (it is later revealed that she had chosen Taub and Kutner, the two male applicants, because she suspected that House would defy her suggestion and choose at least one female candidate.) In the sixth season Taub quit PPTH and returned to his plastic surgery practice during the brief period Foreman led the diagnostics team after House's departure in the episode "Epic Fail", saying he had only joined the team "to work with House." When House returned to PPTH in the episode "Teamwork", House brought Taub back into the team along with Thirteen, Chase and Foreman. In the episode "Lockdown," it is revealed that Taub has an outstanding educational and early professional profile. He also expressed frustration that he has not continued the same level of success in his current professional career and is now working with people of a younger age. Taub interviewed Masters for medical school.
Personal life.
Taub is married to Rachel, and although he genuinely loves his wife, he has been unfaithful to her. He had a successful career in cosmetic surgery, but that ended after having an affair with a partner's daughter or a nurse, based on different versions of his story. When asked why he gave up his chosen practice completely, he simply says, "I love my wife." His partners signed a non-disclosure agreement (with respect to his affair) and Taub signed a non-compete, meaning he could no longer practice cosmetic surgery.
In spite of this, he has shown indicators for future adultery, admitting to House, "Some people pop pills. I cheat. We all have our vices." (It has been confirmed in "Open and Shut", where Taub proceeds to cheat with the young nurse although the "affair circle" seems to have ended.) In the episode "Mirror Mirror", the patient with a rare type of Mirror syndrome (which causes him to take on the persona of someone in the room with him), sees that he is attracted to Amber Volakis' dominant personality, and the two share a flirtatiously combative dialogue. In the episode "Whatever It Takes", Taub reveals that he is Jewish, though it is revealed in "Don't Ever Change" that he describes himself as a non-practicing or a very Liberal or Reform one. This is supported by the fact that House often alludes to Taub's religion, e.g. giving him a "Gold Star of David" for identifying intracranial pressure in a patient.
In the episode "Adverse Events", Lucas, House's PI, finds out that Taub's wife Rachel opened a secret bank account. House tells Taub that she's put $83,000 in it. When Taub confronts her about it, she tells him she's been saving up to buy him the car he wanted as a surprise because she knew he'd never buy it himself. When she finally gives him the car he apparently decides to tell her he cheated on her, but the conversation isn't shown in the episode. In the "Birthmarks" episode, he claims to have told her, and indicates that she has not thrown him out, and that they are talking about how to handle their situation.
In the episode "The Itch", it is revealed that he had been sleeping on the couch, and by the end of the episode his wife had finally forgiven him. In the 100th episode, "The Greater Good", Taub mentions wanting to possibly have children, although his wife seems opposed to the idea.
In "Painless", he states his opinion that suicide is never a solution. Kutner questions him, convinced that anyone so thoroughly opposed to it must carry some sort of baggage associated with it. Taub later tells Kutner that a colleague of his once attempted suicide, and though he survived, his family and friends were deeply disturbed. When Kutner asks if it was in fact Taub who attempted suicide, Taub denies it; however, when House assumes the same thing in "Simple Explanation", he does not. After Kutner's suicide, Taub is angry and withdrawn, focusing intently on their current patient even when Chase confronts him about it, telling him to "go home and cry". He does not attend Kutner's funeral, but rather stays to watch over the team's patient. Later, however, he is seen weeping on a bench in the hallway. In "Bombshells", the insight with which he deduces a patient is suffering from a major depressive disorder leads the patient to suspect that Taub too suffered from depression, which he does not deny, and Taub admits to having "hurt" himself in that time of his life.
In "Larger than Life", Taub decides to divorce Rachel because she had turned to an online relationship for comfort and no longer loved him the way she used to. Taub consequently moves in with Foreman, following a stint living in a hotel room.
In "Here Kitty", Taub is revealed to have attended the Collegiate School for High School.
Taub begins a brief relationship with a CNA who works at the hospital after his failed marriage with Rachel, however it is revealed in "After Hours" that Taub is still seeing his wife for brief promiscuous encounters. Also in "After Hours" it is revealed that Taub's new tryst Ruby has become pregnant, and Taub breaks down and goes to a strip club with Foreman. Taub assumes he will be a horrible father, and after almost being shot by a dancer from the club he attended, (whom Taub unwittingly fondled and later was checking the dancer's mole if the same is malignant or not) he decided to confront Ruby about the matter of whether or not to keep their baby. Taub references a patient he had during his plastic surgery career who accepted death without fear due to having children, and tells Ruby he wants to keep the baby. In the final episode of season 7 "Moving On" Taub's (ex) wife Rachel confronts him at the hospital, and tells him that she is also pregnant. At the end of season 7 it is unclear whether or not either of the women who are pregnant with Taub's baby know, or will know, about the other. In the season 8 episode "The Confession", it is revealed that both of Taub's children are girls, one named Sophie and the other named Sophia. But in later episodes, the one named Sophia was nicknamed Sophie.

Victorian Railways B class

The mainline passenger locomotives later classified as B class ran on the Victorian Railways between 1862 and 1917. Utilising a 2-4-0 wheel arrangement to allow greater traction on the heavily graded new lines to Ballarat and Echuca rather than the 2-2-2 arrangement previously selected for VR's Geelong line, these highly successful passenger locomotives are regarded as the first mainline VR locomotives.
History.
The recently formed Victorian Railways, having purchased the struggling Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1856 and more recently the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company's line to Geelong in 1860, had begun the construction of two new mainlines to connect the booming gold-mining towns of Ballarat, Castlemaine and Sandhurst, as well as tap the lucrative Murray River trade at Echuca. These ambitious new railway projects, despite being engineered to very high (and very expensive) standards, traversed some difficult terrain and featured numerous gradients of up to 1 in 50. The 2-2-2 passenger locomotives VR had used to operate its relatively flat Geelong line proved to be unsuitable for heavy grades, and VR's fleet was already stretched to service the needs of its rapidly expanding network.
New locomotives were ordered in February 1861 from R and W Hawthorn in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, with a layout very similar to that of a successful 2-4-0 design previously been built for the Great Northern Railway, with modifications such as the fitting of cabs and steam domes.
Production.
The initial order of seven 2-4-0 locomotives was followed by another order of seven of the same type from Beyer, Peacock and Company in April 1862, followed by two further orders of six locomotives each in October and the following January. 
None of the locomotives had arrived in time for the opening of the Geelong to Ballarat line in April 1862, and passenger services on the line had to be worked by suburban saddle tank locomotives (later known as the L class) until the arrival of the first of the new mainline locomotives in July 1862. 
The success of the 2-4-0 mainline locomotives was such that despite ongoing advances in locomotive technology, the design continued to be built. A further order of six locomotives was placed with Beyer Peacock in 1871, and a further two were built by the Phoenix Foundry of Ballarat in 1880.
The locomotives, initially unclassed, went through an initial renumbering scheme in which odd numbers were used to denote goods locomotives and even numbers reserved for passenger locomotives, before being classed "B" in VR's 1889 renumbering. By this time, a new 4-4-0 express passenger locomotive had been introduced and took the "A class" designation.
Design features.
The B class locomotives were easily recognisable by their use of external frames and bearings, and coupling rods mounted outside the frames, earning them the nickname "overarmers".
The B class locomotives featured an unusual design of firebox with two separate chambers, each with its own firedoor, divided by a water space that effectively acted as a thermic syphon, and joined at the tubeplate. The two fireboxes were designed to be worked separately, with one fire being built while the other was burning, and was designed to extract the maximum heat from the wood fuels the VR used in its early years. However, the last two locomotives, built in the 1880s, had a conventional single firebox.
Service Life.
The B class' initial duties hauling passenger services on the new mainlines were to expand as the mainline network grew. B 88 had the honour of hauling the first VR train to Albury on 14 June 1883. 
B 50 was selected to haul the first Victorian Railways Royal Train in 1867, taking Prince Alfred Duke of Edinburgh to Ballarat, Bendigo and Castlemaine. The Royal Train was recorded running the between Melbourne and Geelong in as little as 52 minutes.
By 1894, the VR's Rolling Stock Branch Diagram Book noted their allocation around the state, with 2 at Stawell, 6 at Melbourne, 5 at Bendigo, 3 at Geelong, 6 at Ballarat, 4 at Benalla, and 3 at Seymour.
While the B class locomotives were highly successful on the expensively-engineered 1860s mainlines for which they were designed, they were less suited for the more cheaply built extensions to the VR system. Future VR express passenger locomotives were to use a four wheel leading bogie to steer the locomotive, and from 1884 a class of 4-4-0 locomotives (later classed 'Old A') began to supplement, and eventually supersede the B class. Despite the delivery of the Old A, and the later and increasingly larger 'New A' and AA class 4-4-0s of 1889 and 1900 respectively, the entire B class (other than a couple of accident write-offs) lasted into the Twentieth century, with their roles ranging from double heading on express passenger trains down to shunting duties.
Design improvements.
Given their long life and the considerable technological development of railways during that period, the B class locomotives saw a number of improvements. 
As delivered, the only means of braking the locomotive was by operating a handbrake on the tender wheels. B 50 and B 108 were used in comparative trials of the Woods hydraulic and Westinghouse air brake systems in January 1884, with the Westinghouse system being later adopted as the standard.
During the 1880s, their boiler pressure was increased from 130 to 140 psi, and their cylinder bore increased from 16 to 17 inches, with those rebuilt after 1896 being fitted with 17.5 inch cylinders. These changes led to considerably increased tractive effort.
Their large spark-arresting chimneys were replaced with a straight chimney, with a conical spark arrestor being located in the smokebox. 
The cab was also redesigned to provide greater amenity to the crew, with the original sheet metal structure, prone to vibration at speed, being replaced by one of wood, and a double roof was employed for greater comfort in Australian weather conditions.
Accidents.
B 82 and B 92 were wrecked beyond repair in a head-on collision on the Geelong line between Little River and Werribee on 2 April 1884. On 18 August of the same year, B 72's boiler exploded at Warrenheip, although this locomotive was repaired and returned to service. 
B 110 was involved in a spectacular mishap on 13 April 1904 when it pushed a rake of coal wagons off the end of the coal stage at Seymour and was left suspended by its tender and the wreckage of the wagons below.
Withdrawal and scrapping.
Other than accident write-offs, the entire class lasted until 1904, when ten were withdrawn, many of which were by this stage over forty years old. Over the next ten years, the remainder of the class was gradually retired as mechanical condition dictated to the point where just two locomotives, B 56 and B 76, remained on the register. 
These last two members of the class served out their final days shunting carriages at Spencer Street Station and North Melbourne yards, and were withdrawn for scrapping in May and June 1917. 
None were preserved.

The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)

The Wizard of Oz is a musical with a book by John Kane, music by Harold Arlen and lyrics by E.Y. Harburg. It has additional background music by Herbert Stothart. It is based on the novel "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" by L. Frank Baum and the 1939 film version written by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf.
Successful musicals based on the Baum novel were created in 1902 (for Broadway) and 1945 (for St. Louis Municipal Opera), the latter of which, using songs from the popular 1939 film, is still frequently revived. Seeking to more closely recreate the 1939 film on stage, the Royal Shakespeare Company adapted the film's screenplay, also using the songs from the film, and produced a new version at London's Barbican Centre in 1987. This was also a success and has been given many revivals in various formats. This musical has been touring the U.S. since 2008. It has become a popular musical for community theatres, schools and children's theatres in the United States and the United Kingdom.
History.
"The Wizard of Oz" was first turned into a musical extravaganza by L. Frank Baum himself. A loose adaptation of Baum's 1900 novel (there is no Wicked Witch or Toto, and there are some new characters), it first played in Chicago in 1902 and was a success on Broadway the following year. It then toured for seven years. The 1939 film adaptation bore a closer resemblance to the storyline of Baum's original novel than most previous versions. It was a strong success, won the Academy Awards for best song and best score, and has been frequently broadcast on television. This was followed, in 1945, by a musical theatre adaptation presented at the St. Louis Municipal Opera (MUNY). The script was adapted by Frank Gabrielson from the novel, but it is influenced in some respects by the motion picture script and uses most of the songs from the film. A new song was added for Dorothy to sing in the Emerald City, called "Evening Star", and the Wizard goes home in a rocket ship instead of a hot air balloon. The MUNY version continues to receive frequent revivals.
According to Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) director Ian Judge, the company's 1987 adaptation "came about when Terry Hands, artistic director of the company, asked for a show that could be performed annually over the Christmas season, as a revival of J. M. Barrie's play "Peter Pan" had been previously. ... Judge obtained the rights to the film. ... An additional verse has been put back into the Academy Award-winning song 'Over the Rainbow,' as well as an entire number, 'The Jitterbug,' that was cut from the movie. Every word of the screenplay has been left in. 'We've just fattened it out a little bit because you need a few more words in the theater than you need in the movies.'" In 1986, John Kane was asked by the company to write the book for the adaptation. This hews even more closely to the film's screenplay than the 1945 MUNY version and attempts to recreate the film's atmosphere and some of its special effects.
Synopsis.
A young girl, Dorothy Gale, lives on a farm in Kansas with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and little dog Toto. Feeling unappreciated, she dreams of a far away place ("Over the Rainbow"). Miss Gulch, their unpleasant neighbor, serves Dorothy with a summons to take Toto away. He escapes from her bicycle basket, and Dorothy runs away from home with him. On the road, they find a showman, Professor Marvel, who urges her to return to the farm. Dorothy arrives home, just as a tornado touches down. She and Toto are locked out of the storm cellar. In her house, she is accidentally hit on the head by a window.
The house is carried by the tornado to the Land of Oz. Dorothy meets the Munchkins and Glinda, the Good Witch of the North (who resembles Aunt Em). Her house has fallen upon, and killed, the Wicked Witch of the East. This frees the Munchkins from her power, and they treat Dorothy as their heroine ("Come Out, Come Out"; "Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead"). The Wicked Witch of the West (who resembles Miss Gulch) arrives to claim her sister's magic ruby slippers and vows to avenge her death. Glinda has already put the slippers on Dorothy's feet, further infuriating the witch. Dorothy wants to go home to Kansas. The Munchkins tell her that the Wizard of Oz will know what to do ("Follow the Yellow Brick Road"). She starts off towards the Emerald City. 
Dorothy and Toto meet three strange traveling companions, each of whom needs help: The Scarecrow's head is full of straw ("If I Only Had a Brain"). The rusty Tin Man's chest is empty ("If I Only Had a Heart") and the Cowardly Lion is afraid of his own tail ("If I Only Had the Nerve"). Dorothy invites them all to join her to see if the Wizard can help them ("We're Off to See the Wizard"). The Wicked Witch of the West threatens them along the way but fails to intimidate Dorothy into giving up the ruby slippers. She creates a beautiful field of poppies, but their scent is poisonous. Glinda rescues the travelers by covering the poppies with snowflakes ("Optimistic Voices"). They then finally reach the Emerald City. 
The Emerald City's Gatekeeper tries to discourage the travelers, but they are persistent and gain entry ("The Merry Old Land of Oz"). They are washed, combed, and buffed, but the Wizard refuses to meet them. The Wicked Witch makes another ominous appearance, and the Lion wishes more than ever for courage ("If I Were King of the Forest"). Finally taken to see the fearsome Wizard, the four friends are given a quest to prove themselves worthy of his assistance: they must bring him the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West, and the only way to do that would be to kill her.
The friends leave in fear and haste for the land of the Winkies (whom the Wicked Witch has enslaved and forced to serve in her army) and her castle ("March of the Winkies"). In a haunted forest, the jitterbugs make the travelers dance until they all collapse from exhaustion ("The Jitterbug"). The Wicked Witch's winged monkeys then attack, swooping away with Dorothy and Toto. But the witch still does not have the power to take the ruby slippers off of Dorothy's feet ("Over the Rainbow" - Reprise). Toto manages to escape and help the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion to find her. They disguise themselves in Winkie uniforms and sneak into the castle. They find her, but the Wicked Witch foils their escape. She attacks the Scarecrow with fire, and Dorothy throws a bucket of water at him, accidentally dousing the witch. She screams, steams, and melts into nothing ("Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead" - Reprise). The friends take her broom back to the Emerald City.
The Wizard is again reluctant to meet Dorothy and friends. Toto pulls aside the curtain behind which the Wizard is revealed as an ordinary man (who resembles Professor Marvel) using a microphone to make his voice impressive. Nevertheless, he is able to help the travelers. He conducts a graduation exercise, awarding the Scarecrow with a doctorate of Thinkology; appoints the Lion as a member of the Legion of Courage; and presents the Tin Man with a heart-shaped ticker – a watch. Finally, he reveals that he is from the prairies himself and offers to give Dorothy a ride back to Kansas in the hot-air balloon that brought him to Oz. It takes off while she is distracted, and she is afraid that she missed her chance to go home, but Glinda arrives. She says that Dorothy has the power to transport herself and Toto by clicking her heels together three times and repeating "There's no place like home".
Dorothy wakes up in Kansas with a bump on her head. The tornado has passed. Miss Gulch broke her leg when the storm blew down a telegraph pole – she won't be riding her bicycle any time soon. Dorothy is overjoyed to see her family and friends, whom she appreciates more than ever.
Productions.
1987 Original London production.
The RSC based its costumes on a combination of the book's original artwork and the style of the then-popular musical "The Wiz". The original cast featured Imelda Staunton as Dorothy Gale; Bille Brown (in drag) as Miss Gulch/the Wicked Witch of the West; Dilys Laye and later Joyce Grant as Aunt Em/Glinda, the Good Witch of the North; and Trevor Peacock as Zeke/the Cowardly Lion and Sebastian Shaw as Oz/Professor Marvel. When the same production was reproduced in 1988, Gillian Bevan played Dorothy. The production was an immediate success in London when it opened at London's Barbican Theatre. "The Times" reviewer wrote: "This is, to come out with it immediately, the most marvellous show."
The RSC revived the show the following season, again with Gillian Bevan as Dorothy, and recorded a cast album of the show. The staging has been repeated frequently by musical theatre companies in the United Kingdom.
1988 United States premiere.
The RSC version's first outing in the U.S. was in 1988 in a production starring Cathy Rigby as Dorothy (she had made her musical debut in the role in a 1981 MUNY revival) and Lara Teeter as the Scarecrow. This was presented by the Long Beach Civic Light Opera (Long Beach, California) from July 14 to July 31, 1988.
1989 The Wizard of Oz Live! Arena Show.
In 1989, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the film, the RSC script and score were adapted into an arena-style touring production in the U.S. According to "USA Today", the show was "Built to play about 70 stadiums across the country, the $5 million production opened Wednesday at Radio City Music Hall." The production, with many dramatic and, according to critics, ill-advised design features, was not well received and had a short run, closing quietly in 1990.
1990s productions.
In 1992, the Paper Mill Playhouse, Millburn, New Jersey, produced the Royal Shakespeare Company's version. Eddie Bracken was featured as a Guard and the Wizard. The "New York Times" review noted that "Robert Johanson and James Rocco, sharing credit for direction and choreography, are attempting to relive the movie with up-to-the-minute stage effects. Ergo. Comes the cyclone, the cow flies. The farmhouse zooms over the first rows and lands back on stage, in the manner of the "Phantom's" crashing chandelier. Dorothy is suspended, Peter Pan-like, on high wires. All manner of creeping, crawling creatures augment the ascending ones; monkeys levitate, spookily; everyone, it appears, sooner or later, ascends, over and over."
The RSC version was used in the first U.S. stage touring production based on the film, beginning in 1993. The "Boston Herald" reported that the show was "complete with all the beloved songs by Harold Arlen and E. Y. Harburg. It's well-acted and extremely well-sung by a cast that draws on the movie classic's indelible characterizations of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, etc."
This Kenneth Feld production toured from 1996 to 1999. The ice show followed "the familiar story largely intact from the 1939 MGM film" and was choreographed by Robin Cousins. It featured a pre-recorded soundtrack with the voices of Laurena Wilkerson as Dorothy and Bobby McFerrin as all of the other characters (including the female characters). The costumes and some staging concepts did not follow the MGM movie: The Witch "flew", while Glinda "skated" her initial arrivals and exits onstage. The production toured nationally and internationally.
A television adaptation of the production, featuring Oksana Baiul as Dorothy and Victor Petrenko as the Scarecrow, was telecast in 1996.
This version used the RSC version and was filmed for television by the TNT Network with an all star cast, including newcomer Jewel as Dorothy and Joel Grey as the Wizard. Jackson Browne, Roger Daltrey and Nathan Lane played the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion. Debra Winger was the Wicked Witch. A cast album was made that includes more of the music from the show than the 1989 RSC recording as well as some dialogue.
The Madison Square Garden, New York production opened in May 1997 for 48 performances. Co-produced by the Paper Mill Playhouse, it used a shorter version of the show, 90 minutes long, and score designed for younger audiences. Directed by Paper Mill artistic director Robert Johanson, the cast included Roseanne Barr as the Wicked Witch of the West and Ken Page, Lara Teeter and Michael Gruber as the Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow and Tin Man.
This production was repeated in May 1998 at Madison Square Garden. It featured Mickey Rooney as the Wizard and Eartha Kitt as the Wicked Witch of the West. She was later replaced by Jo Anne Worley. Most of the 1997 cast returned, and it was this cast that made the cast recording associated with this version. This engagement was part of a US tour that ended in 1999.
2008 U.S. Tour.
A touring production of the show uses the RSC version. With new technology for scenery and special effects, this production has proven to be a success, running in cities across the U.S. The production began in October 2008 and continued through January 2012.

Mimi Lozano

Mimi Lozano (born 1933) is an educator and activist for Hispanic rights who co-founded the Society of Hispanic Historical and Ancestral Research and is the editor and publisher of Somos Primos, an online monthly publication dedicated to Hispanic heritage. She was named the 2006 Woman of the Year by Costa Mesa, California Assemblyman Van Tran.
Early years.
Lozano (birth name: Nohemi Lozano) was born in San Antonio, Texas to Catalino Lozano and Aurora Chapa. Her family moved to Los Angeles, California when she was an infant where she received her primary education. She moved from Los Angeles after her parents divorced and in 1951, Lozano and her sister graduated from Manteca High School in the San Joaquin Valley.
Education.
Lozano attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and in 1955, earned her Bachelors of Science degree. That same year she married Win Holtzman whom she met while attending the UCLA graduate summer school. She continued her academic education in UCLA and earned her Masters in Public and Recreation Administration in 1957. During her undergraduate studies at UCLA she was involved in many youth related activities. As an interviewer of Los Angeles Playground Directors for the L.A. County Social Services, she began to see what little understanding existed among the playground directors of the Mexican culture. 
In 1970, she earned her K-12 Teaching Credential from the University of California State, Dominguez College and in 1975 her Teaching Credentials from the California State Community College. Lozano was a Puppetry and Marionette teacher from 1975 to 1980 at Golden West College, Huntington Beach, California. where she completed 3 media related Golden West College grants. In 1975, she had an opportunity of using her position as instructor of Puppetry at Golden West College to help educate the community to the broader Hispanic culture. Using puppetry as the media, she produced/directed/mounted Hispanic folktales puppet plays. These were performed in the little theater at Golden West College to a children's audience. In 1981, she earned her State Certificate of Competence, in Spanish, also special ESL and Bilingual training.
"SHAAR".
She became involved in promoting Hispanic heritage, locally and nationally and in 1986, Lozano, together with Tony Campos, Raul Guerra and Ophelia Marquez, co-founded the Society of Hispanic Historical and Ancestral Research (SHHAR) in Orange County, California. SHHAR is a non-profit, all-volunteer organization whose purpose is helping Hispanics and Latinos research their family history. The SHHAR booth at the Orange County Fair has won first place ribbons in Education and Quality and has taken ribbons at each of the four years, starting in 2000, in which SHHAR participated. Lozano currently serves as president of the organization which has grown to a national networking status.
"Somos Primos".
In 1990, Lozano founded and has served as the editor and publisher of Somos Primos. Somos Primos, originally printed as a quarterly newsletter, is an online monthly publication dedicated to Hispanic heritage. Somos Primos came about out of the necessity for a SHHAR member newsletter. Somos Primos was first distributed to members, as a quarterly newsletter. In 1995, a database was developed for networking purposes for Somos Primos with the assistance of her husband Win Holtzman. This service in turn helped the increasing number of out of state and out of the country readers and researchers to communicate with each other. That same year, Lozano was named to the US Senate Task Force on Hispanic Affairs . 
In 1995, she was involved with a Heritage Subcommittee which formed the nucleus of the Hispanic Heritage Committee of Orange County. The subcommittee's activity attempted to promote more awareness of Hispanic history and culture. In 1999, Board Lozano became a member of the Pepperdine University's Hispanic Council of Orange County. Lozano who was named to the US Senate Republican Conference Task Force on Hispanic Affair (1997–2003) has spoken as an invited guest by the U.S. Army at the Pentagon during the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month.
Honor.
Lozano, was named California’s 68th Assembly District’s 2006 Woman of the Year by Assemblyman Van Tran. The annual Woman of the Year celebration at the State Capitol was founded by Assembly members Bev Hansen (R) and Sally Turner (D) in 1987 in honor of Women’s History Month and is sponsored by the California Legislative Women’s Caucus. Lozano is credited with pressing the Archives and other federal agencies to acknowledge publicly the significant contributions of Hispanics nationwide. She is quoted in Weekly Report as saying:
"There are too many such stories long ignored, but there’s still time to add them to the nation’s historical record for future generations to integrate our historical contributions into the history and development of the U.S. We have been viewed as separate and apart, when in fact we provided a foundation. These events will reveal that truth of our continual presence and support" 
Lozano and her husband reside in California and have two children: a son Aury, a family physician, and a daughter Tawn, an attorney.

Malacca Zoo

Malacca Zoo is a zoological park located besides "Lebuh Ayer Keroh" (Federal Route ) in the town of Ayer Keroh in the state of Malacca, Malaysia. More than 1200 animals of 215 species can be found at the Malacca Zoo. It is the second-largest zoo in Malaysia behind the National Zoo of Malaysia (Zoo Negara). In 2007, along with the "Visit Malaysia" campaign, Malacca Zoo was visited by 619,194 visitors; the highest number ever recorded.
History.
The zoo was established in 1963, along with the National Zoo of Malaysia (Zoo Negara), but its management was later taken over by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks of Malaysia in 1979. This enhanced its operations and upgraded its services for the public’s benefit. It was used as a wildlife rescue base before it was opened to the public by the then Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohammad on August 13, 1987. Although it has long been opened to the public, its primary roles as a rescue base and an animal sanctuary remain unchanged. It now houses many birds, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, insects, and is the second largest zoo behind the National Zoo in Ulu Klang.
The zoo.
Malacca Zoo was the first zoo in Malaysia to exhibit the critically endangered Sumatran Rhinoceros. It also houses overseas as well as local beauties such as the White Rhinoceros, Asian Elephants, Red Panda, Malaysian Gaur, the Serow, the Squirrel Monkey, the Molurus Python, the Grey Wolf, the Mongolian Wild Horse, the Green Tree Python, the Giraffe, the Blue-and-yellow Macaw and also the Indochinese Tiger as well as the Malayan Tiger
Malacca Zoo is now a famous attraction in Malacca and are listed in many official tourism websites. Now, it is visited annually by 400,000 visitors; averaging 1093 visitors a day. Although, in 2007, the zoo was visited by 619,194 visitors with an average of 1619 visitors per day; the highest number since it was opened. In that year, the zoo collected as much as RM 3.99 million (USD 886,666); collecting a gain of RM 130,000. It also maintains a healthy, cool green background by planting exotic and rare plants while labeling them. This can potentially cool the zoo in very hot days and symbolically mimics the rainforest. It also has a tram facility to help its visitors get from one place to another with the ticket prices as low as RM 2.00. In addition to that, it also has eating facilities at the A&W restaurant and a cafeteria near the watch tower at the Mini Safari located near Marina Zenorai.
Breeding plans.
The zoo is planning some programmes to ensure the survival of some endangered species. Some of them are captive breeding. 
Since the Malayan Tiger ("Panthera Tigris Malayenis") was found as a tiger sub-species, the zoo had raised over 40 tiger cubs and sent them to various types of places such as the United States. Two of them was Mek Degong and its mate Awang Relak; Malayan Tigers that were sent to San Diego Zoo in 2004. Besides that, it is also been used as a captured animal sanctuary for a temporary time until it is sent locally or abroad.
Attractions.
Some other attractions at the zoo includes:
Location.
The Zoo is located in the town of Ayer Keroh besides the Lebuh Ayer Keroh at the entrance of Melaka; 13 Kilometres from Malacca Town. It neighbors with the Ayer Keroh Crocodile Farm, Melaka International Trade Center, Kolej Yayasan Saad, Melaka Manipal Medical College. From the highway, it has a noticeable gate in the Minangkabau design.

Gods of Football, part of Naked For A Cause initiative featured some of the sexiest Australian rules football players and Australian Rugby League players. The campaign was organized for producing an accompaying nude calendar to raise money for the McGrath Foundation, which supports breast cancer research and cancer awareness. The creative director and the photographer of the project was Pedro Virgil. 
The initiative was launched on the Footy Show on the 14 August 2008. A first selection players was profiled. Images of each weeks' selection of players were published in Australia's Sunday Telegraph newspaper as well. Forty of Australian rules footballers and Australian Rugby League footballers were invited to pose naked. The provocative fundraising campaign was highly successful transforming the young sporting athletes into international male calendar celebrities. Although there was some opposition for the explicit nudity, the campaign generated great goodwill as well.
Calendars were issued for 2008, 2009 (Rugby League Calendar / Australian Rules Calendar / International Calendar), 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Accompanying DVDs are sometimes prepared, e.g. "The Making of the 2009 Calendars", a film by Grant Carroll and released by "Naked For A Cause". Special country releases may have different covers.

<doc id="18792791" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18792791" title="Florida arrowroot">
Florida arrowroot

Florida arrowroot was the commercial name of an edible starch extracted from "Zamia integrifolia" (coontie), a small cycad native to North America.
Use.
Like other cycads, "Zamia integrifolia" is poisonous, producing a toxin that affects the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. The toxin can however be removed by careful leaching, and the roots and half-buried stems of this cycad were used by Native American people (notably the Tequesta and Mayaimi Indians, the Seminole Indians and the Maroons) to produce this starch. The root is typically prepared by grinding (macerating) it using a wooden mortar and pestle. The pulp is then saturated in water and drained. The drained fluid is allowed to dry and the resulting yellowish powder is used in the preparation of various foods. In commercial production, multiple macerations achieved a whiter color.
Commercial production of the starch (using roots gathered from wild plants) occurred in southern Florida from the 1830s until the 1920s. The starch was sold as Florida arrowroot until the Food and Drug Administration banned the practice in 1925. The last commercial "coontie starch" factory in Florida was destroyed by the 1926 Miami Hurricane.
Etymology.
The reference to arrowroot, a well known and high quality starch, was a marketing ploy. Because of this use, "Zamia integrifolia" is sometimes known as Florida arrowroot.

<doc id="18792854" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18792854" title="Chiradzulu Mountain">
Chiradzulu Mountain

Chiradzulu Mountain is located approximately 20 km to the north-east of Blantyre, Malawi's main commercial centre. The administrative district of Chiradzulu in southern Malawi was named after this mountain. Chiradzulu Mountain rises to a peak of 1,773m above seal level and is the third highest mountain peak in southern Malawi. It comes third after Mulanje Mountain, whose famous Sapitwa peak rises to 3,002m above sea level; and Zomba Mountain, which rises to 2,085m above sea level at its peak.
The origins of the name "Chiradzulu" are murky and can be traced back to an old myth supposedly derived from hunters who had forgotten to bring home the tail of a leopard they had killed on a hunting expedition. In ancient local folklore among some of the people who lived at the foot of the mountain, the tail of a leopard was considered to have magical powers and no hunter worth his name would kill a leopard and forget to bring the sought-after trophy home as an essential ingredient for a magical ritual which gave chiefs and notable tribesmen their mythical powers. On realising their foolish lapse of memory the morning after their hunting expedition, the band of hunters reorganised and retraced their steps to the place up in the mountain where they had had their kill. The foolish hunters never made it back home and no one ever heard of them after their disappearance that fateful morning. This was not unusual in those times, for, according to folklore, the mountain was full of ghosts which sometimes exacted vengeance on wayward humans who ventured too far off the beaten track into the thick of the then rich forest jungle by making them mysteriously disappear from the world of mortals, only to be reincarnated as ghosts themselves.
Folklore has it that it is the above episode which gave birth to the name "Chiradzulu", a corruption of two Nyanja words, "mchira" and "wadzulo". "Mchira" literally means "a tail", and "wadzulo" translates to "yesterday's". So "Chiradzulu" literally means "Yesterday's Tail", a reference to the fate of the men who vanished into the jungle to collect the leopard's tail they had forgotten to carry home with them after the previous day's hunting expedition.
Chiradzulu Mountain rises imperiously from the valley below its southern silhouette and can be viewed by Zomba-bound motorists along the Blantyre-Zomba Road, from as far away as Mapanga. Its massive form looms larger as motorists approach Njuli. It cuts a picturesque backdrop to the east of the Blantyre-Zomba Road as motorists cruise past Njuli, aiming to perhaps stop and catch their breath at Namadzi, an intriguing town by a river of the same name on the Zomba District border. From this vantage point, motorists can, on a clear day, look back to catch one last silhouetted view of Chiradzulu Mountain as it lumbers tantalisingly further to the south-east.
The form of the mountain takes on a curious appearance when viewed at a distance from its southern silhouette. It has the appearance of a huge, overweight man laughing, with its peak forming the head and the rest of its form below, forming the laboured shape of a legless, bloated man. This curious shape has earned the mountain the nickname of "Man Mountain" by tourists. Whilst there are no doubt mythological explanations among the surrounding tribal peoples as to how the mountain acquired its shape, geomorphology would suggest that this is the product of millennia of faulting activity coupled by the chiselling effects of wind erosion on the bare rock outcrops. One would also add that it is the tantalising effects of visual illusion from a distance which completes the picture.
The mountain is actually divided into two parts, each with its own peak. Lisawo - which is the peak motorists view as they drive along the Blantyre-Zomba Road - is a younger sister to the mightier peak described above, which is simply called Chiradzulu. A winding road, a sight-seer's boon, runs between these two peaks. This road joins the villages to the north of the mountain, an area generally referred to as Mpama, with the villages on the foot of the mountain to its south, an area referred to variously as Malika or Lisawo. Midway through the course of its descent up the mountain, the road cuts through a plateaux-like plain between the two peaks, on which the British colonial government established an administrative settlement housing offices, a tourist information centre, and staff accommodation. It is from here that the author used to procure his supplies of "gondolosi" and "kajaliasi" (two potent aphrodisiacs!) from one of the sons of the chief resident forest ranger, a Mr Likharu!
Chiradzulu Mountain was for a long time home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, hyenas, foxes, jackals, baboons, monkeys, antelope, wild pigs, and the fabled leopards. Due to overpopulation and poor wildlife conservation practices, some of these species, especially the big cats, have disappeared from the mountain or are at near-extinction levels. There is no doubt that even the potent "gondolosi" and "kajaliasi" herbs have now been over-consumed to extinction!

Natabhairavi

Natabhairavi (pronounced naṭabhairavi) is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 20th "melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system. It corresponds to the natural minor scale of western music system.
Natabhairavi corresponds to the "Asavari thaat" of Hindustani music. In the Muthuswami Dikshitar school this rāgam is called Nārīrītigowla. "Natabhairavi" is known to be a rāgam that incites feelings of grandeur and devotion in the listeners.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 2nd rāgam in the 4th "chakra Veda". The mnemonic name is "Veda-Sri". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ri gi ma pa dha ni". Its "" structure is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on the notations used):
It is a "sampoorna" rāgam - rāgam having all 7 "swarams". It is the "shuddha madhyamam" equivalent of "Shanmukhapriya", which is the 56th "melakarta".
Asampurna Melakarta.
Nārīrītigowla is the 20th "Melakarta" in the original list compiled by Venkatamakhin. The notes used in the scale are the same, but the scales have "vakra prayoga" (zig-zag usage of notes in the ascending and descending scale).
"Janya" rāgams.
"Natabhairavi" has a number of popular "janya" rāgams (derived scales) such as "Bhairavi", "Anandabhairavi", "Saramati", "Jaunpuri", "Hindolam" (sometimes "Hindolam" is also associated as a Janya of "Hanumatodi") and "Jayanthasree". See List of "janya" rāgams for a full list of "Natabhairavi's" janya rāgams.
Popular compositions.
"Sri Valli Devasena pathe" is a popular composition in "Natabhairavi", composed by Papanasam Sivan. "Parulaseva" by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar is another well known composition in this rāgam. "Upacaharamu jeseva", composed by Thyagaraja is also popular.
Muthuswami Dikshitar's composition "Sri Neelotpalanayike" is set to "Nārīrītigowla".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Natabhairavi's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 5 other major "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Kalyani", "Sankarabharanam",
"Hanumatodi", "Kharaharapriya" and "Harikambhoji". For further details and an illustration of Graha bhedam of this rāgam refer Graha bhedam on Sankarabharanam.
Even though Natabhairavi has quite evenly spaced "swara sthanas" (pitch positions, notes) like the other 5 in this group, it has not found as much importance in concerts. One is likely to find "Kalyani", "Todi", "Sankarabharanam" and "Karaharapriya" as the main ragam in concerts, more often than "Natabhairavi" by a big count.

Legacy of Hopelessness is the second EP by Canadian grindcore band Fuck the Facts. The drums and bass were recorded on November 12, 2004 at June Music Studio in Ottawa, ON. The remaining instruments and vocals were recorded in November and December 2004 at Fuck the Facts home studio (House of Fuck). The EP was mixed and mastered by Craig Boychuk at CB Audio in early 2005.
This was initially planned to be a solo release by Topon Das, however, it was migrated over to Fuck the Facts after the band realized that another full length album was not feasible at that time. As such, the EP tends to show more overt electronic influences than previous releases.
In the UK, this EP was released without the enhanced tracks as an untitled split with Narcosis, Midget Parage and Archer on Privileged to Fail Records. A digital version of the EP was released in January 2011 and included a bonus track "Legacy of Hopelessness".

Allen Morgan

Allen Morgan (Allen Hungerford Morgan) (August 12, 1925 – May 13, 1990) of Wayland, Massachusetts was a noted ornithologist, tireless environmental advocate, avid tennis player, and founder of Sudbury Valley Trustees.
Biography.
"Alan is a born and gifted field naturalist, is one of the best and most active of the younger observers of birds in the State of Massachusetts and furnishes monthly observations of interest for the Bird Bulletin of the New England Museum of Natural History in Boston and for my own Season Reports on New England Bird life in the National Audubon Magazine." (Griscom, 1942)
"He was a conservationist long before it was fashionable, and an inspiring public speaker who could galvanize his audience into action. His untiring spirit, unwavering beliefs, and powers of persuasion brought him success time and time again as he rescued thousands of acres of open space from the threat of development." (Atkins, 1990)
Ornithologist of note.
A protégé of Ludlow Griscom, Morgan's life list comprised more than 600 different birds. He saw the very first Black-backed Gull ever recorded in the Sudbury Valley. Morgan was also a member of a team of three birders who sighted North America's first Cattle Egret in April 1952. He started keeping bird journals on February 18, 1936 to record where he went, when he went, how many birds he saw, and what was interesting about each birding excursion, a practice that he kept religiously up until the late 1960s.
Education.
Morgan attended Wayland public schools, Mount Prospect School for Boys in Waltham, and Weston High School in Weston, Massachusetts. His interest in ornithology began in 1934 when an English and Latin teacher at Mount Prospect, David Lloyd Garrison, came to class all excited about an Orange-crowned Warbler that he had seen at Totten's Pond in back of the school, a very rare sighting for Waltham. Garrison was a close friend of the famed ornithologist Ludlow Griscom.
Morgan gave his first public lecture on birds and conservation to the Wayland Garden Club in 1938, and was elected the first non-Harvard student member of the Harvard Ornithological Club in 1939 at age 14.
Through Garrison, Morgan had the opportunity to meet Russell Mason, then director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society (Mass Audubon), and in 1940, he got to know Mason further during a summer job with the curator of the Boston Society of Natural History, cleaning and cataloging a collection of bird skins housed adjacent to the Mass Audubon headquarters in Boston. He joined Mass Audubon as a member in 1941 and during that year he gave another lecture to the Wayland Garden Club, using a bird-song record and color slides borrowed from Massachusetts Audubon. The club later established a wildlife sanctuary in the Wayland river marshes.
In early 1943, Morgan left high school halfway through his senior year at Weston High School to enter Bowdoin College. He joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve in February, and was employed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service during May and June, working on a gull control project along the Maine coast. He was called to duty by the Marine Corps in July 1943 and was assigned to officer training at Dartmouth College. He served in the Marine Corps in North and South Carolina, Virginia, and California from 1944-1946.
Following graduation from Bowdoin in 1947 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology, Morgan took a job as an insurance underwriter at Aetna Casualty & Surety Company in Hartford, Connecticut. He left Hartford in 1950 to partner with his father, a life insurance salesman in Boston, Massachusetts, but was recalled to the Marine Corps later in the year. He resigned his commission with the Marine Corps and returned to the life insurance business in 1951. He received his Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designation from The American College in 1957.
Shortly thereafter, a friend told Morgan that he had attended a local showing of films by Richard Borden, the famous Walt Disney Company wildlife film-maker and that a Cattle Egret apparently had been captured in the film that had been shot only five months earlier. The next day, Morgan met with Borden, viewed the film and confirmed the recording. Morgan wrote scripts for several of Borden's films, leading to his own interest in wildlife photography. He began to shoot his own 16 millimeter films and sold footage to the Disney Company. Morgan lectured extensively (logging in excess of 100 speaking engagements during some years). He called his presentation "Conservation is Common Sense."
Sudbury Valley Trustees.
Morgan began a campaign to preserve "open space" for people, and habitats for wildlife in 1953. During that year, working with six friends (B. Allen Benjamin, Dr. George K. Lewis, Henry Parker, Willis B. Ryder, Richard Stackpole, and Roger P. Stokey), he founded the Sudbury Valley Trustees, Inc. (SVT), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to conserve land and protect wildlife habitat in the Concord, Assabet, and Sudbury river watersheds in eastern Massachusetts for the benefit of present and future generations. The Marsh Wren on Cattail logo of SVT (shown below at the right) is part of the enduring legacy left by Morgan. That logo, prepared under the supervision of, and at the direction of, Allen Morgan, uniquely illustrates Morgan's vision for the organization at its inception.
Massachusetts Audubon Society.
In 1956 Richard Borden, the newly appointed president of Mass Audubon, asked Morgan to join its Board of Directors. Morgan was appointed Audubon's fifth Executive Vice President less than a year later in November, 1957.
Under Morgan's stewardship, Mass Audubon established its first scientific staff and oversaw its transition from a bird watching and educational group of 4,500 members and 65 permanent staff in 1957 to the largest and most influential conservation organization in the region with a permanent staff of 145 and nearly 28,000 members by the time he left in 1980. Morgan expanded educational programs, established numerous wildlife sanctuaries, and expanded Mass Audubon's nature centers. Morgan traveled widely on behalf of Mass Audubon and lobbied successfully for conservation legislation at both the state and federal level.
Mass Audubon established the Allen Morgan Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1990 as a tribute to Morgan. Mass Audubon awards this prestigious prize to "an individual who demonstrates the dedication, passion, and daring that Morgan exhibited in protecting the natural world."
Positions.
Morgan served on the Wayland Planning Board from 1958 to 1972. He founded the Wayland Conservation Commission in 1959, serving as its Chairman until 1972. He was a member of the Massachusetts Legislative Oversight Committee on Water Pollution in 1966. Morgan was Chairman of the Governor Francis W. Sargent's Committee for Reorganizing the Massachusetts Department of Natural Resources from 1969 to 1971. He served on or consulted with a number of environmental committees, boards, and government commissions, including the Sudbury Valley Trustees, The Environmental Policy Center (Washington, D.C.), the Center for Energy Policy, the New England Wildflower Preservation Society, the Wayland Conservation Commission, the Elbanobscot Foundation, Inc., the National Wildlife Federation, the national Rural Environment and Conservation Advisory Board—Department of Agriculture, the Massachusetts Conservation Council, and the Coastal Wetland Action Committee. In 1972, Morgan was one of three representatives of the United States at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.
SVT full time.
After Morgan's retirement from Mass Audubon in 1980, he was chosen a Fellow of Saybrook College at Yale University. In 1981, he turned his attention full-time to SVT as its first Executive Director. He expanded the SVT membership base, hired a staff, and supervised the acquisition of significant amounts of open space throughout the Sudbury River watershed while continuing his lecturing, consulting, and writing until his death.
Morgan died at the Lahey Clinic in 1990 from prostate cancer a few months prior to his planned retirement in August. He is buried at the Old North Cemetery in Wayland.
Morgan is remembered annually by SVT when it gives the Morgan Volunteer Award to a volunteer who has distinguished him or herself on behalf of SVT. The Marsh Wren on Cattail theme of the SVT logo finds further expression in this Award which is shown in the photograph on the right above the old SVT logo. The old SVT logo, shown here below the Morgan Volunteer Award, is no longer in general use at SVT but is one that Morgan would have known intimately. The logo uniquely illustrates, beyond the power of mere words, the essential vision that Morgan established for the organization he founded.

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1929–39)

This is a listing of all the animated shorts released by Warner Bros. under the "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" banners between 1930 and 1939, plus the 1929 pilot film which was used to sell the "Looney Tunes" series to Leon Schlesinger and Warner Bros.. A total of 271 shorts were released during the 1930s.
1929.
Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid, a 1929 live-action short film produced to sell a series of Bosko cartoons, was never released to theaters, and therefore not seen by a wide audience until 71 years later on Cartoon Network's television special "Toonheads: The Lost Cartoons" on March 12, 2000, although in an edited form. The film was produced in May 1929, directed by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising. In the film, a cartoonist (portrayed in live action by Rudolph Ising) draws Bosko, who comes to life. Bosko speaks, sings, dances and plays the piano before the cartoonist sucks him into his ink pen and pours him back into the inkwell. Bosko pops out of the bottle and promises to return.
The full cartoon is present on disc 4 of the "" as a special feature.
1930.
All cartoons are "Looney Tunes" starring Bosko and are all directed by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising. All cartoons are scored by Frank Marsales. None of the primary characters of Looney Tunes would appear until 1935, and would appear in Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons until 1968.
1931.
All cartoons are "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" starring Bosko, Foxy, Piggy, and other characters and are all directed by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising. All cartoons are scored by Frank Marsales. This year marks the debut of the "Merrie Melodies" series. All Merrie Melodies cartoons are directed by Rudolf Ising, and all Looney Tunes cartoons after "The Tree's Knees" are directed by Hugh Harman.
1932.
All cartoons are directed by Hugh Harman or Rudolf Ising. All cartoons are scored by Frank Marsales.
1933.
All cartoons up until "Buddy's Day Out", are scored by Frank Marsales.
1934.
This year marks the beginning of production of color "Merrie Melodies" cartoons. For this year, most would still be in black and white up until "Rhythm in the Bow". Also, starting with "Honeymoon Hotel", the "I Think You're Ducky" theme was shortened for somewhat reason.
1935.
All "Merrie Melodies" cartoons are in 2-strip Technicolor (except where noted).
1936.
All "Merrie Melodies" cartoons are in 3-strip Technicolor, except where noted.
This year, the "Merrie Melodies" series adopts "Merrily We Roll Along" as its theme (the first cartoon to use this theme is "Boulevardier from the Bronx"). The "Merrie Melodies" series also begins using "target" opening and closing titles this year (starting with "I Wanna Play House", minus the "zooming" WB shield).
1937.
Starting this year, all "Merrie Melodies" cartoons are in 3-strip Technicolor and the "Merrie Melodies" "target" title sequences change colors, with a different color (or color blend) each year. The first new ring colors are a yellow-orange blend, which is first seen on "The Woods Are Full Of Cuckoos". Also beginning this year, the "Looney Tunes" series adopts "The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down" as its theme (beginning with "Rover's Rival").
1938.
The opening rings in "Merrie Melodies" cartoons change colors yet again, changing to a yellow-green color blend that was first used in "The Night Watchman".
1939.
Starting with "Porky and Teabiscuit", the "Warner Bros. Present" opening title with "Warner Bros." on a yellow banner and in an Arial Bold font was used. Starting with "Naughty But Mice", the "Warner Bros. Present" title was used again, but "Warner Bros." was in a Times New Roman font. Starting with "Detouring America", the "Warner Bros. Present" title was used once again, but without a yellow banner on "Warner Bros.".

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1940–49)

This is a listing of all the animated shorts released by Warner Bros. under the "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" banners between 1940 and 1949.
A total of 307 shorts were released during the 1940s.
1942.
This year marks the beginning of production of color Looney Tunes. For this year and next, most would still be in black and white. Looney Tunes also adapts the "target" titles similar to Merrie Melodies, usually with thicker rings.
1943.
Blue Ribbon re-releases start this year, where from cartoons released in the 1935–1948 season have their original credits cut.
1944.
Leon Schlesinger sold his cartoon studio to Warner Bros. in 1944; Eddie Selzer took over as producer after "Buckaroo Bugs" was released.
Beginning this year, all cartoons are in color. Some cartoons would be produced in two-strip Cinecolor in the 1947–1949 season, to save money. All cartoons would be produced in three-strip Technicolor by 1950.
1945.
Every non-Bugs Bunny cartoon released this year except for "Draftee Daffy", "Behind the Meatball", "A Gruesome Twosome", "Wagon Heels", and "Nasty Quacks" were given Blue Ribbon reissues. Starting with "Ain't That Ducky" (which was later reissued), the opening version of The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down is shortened.
Starting from "Hare Trigger", the opening version of Merrily We Roll Along is also shortened.
However, Warner Bros. kept the long version of the Merrily We Roll Along for a.a.p. Blue Ribbon reissues until 1956.
1946.
The Looney Tunes series begins using "That's all Folks!" ending sequences, similar to Merrie Melodies (starting with "Kitty Kornered", on that cartoon the Merrie Melodies ending theme is heard).
1947.
Every non-Bugs Bunny cartoon released this year (as well as any cartoon in the 1946–1947 production season) except for "A Pest in the House", "Catch as Cats Can", and "Mexican Joyride", were given Blue Ribbon reissues. The reason for this is unknown.<br>All cartoons are in 3-strip Technicolor, except where noted.
1948.

A total of 278 shorts were released during the 1950s.
1951.
Most of the cartoons released this year can be given Blue Ribbon reissues. Just like the 1946-1947 production season (which feature a blue-red rings combo), Blue Ribbons seem to plague this year as well. Except for "Hare We Go", the original screen credits and title screens are kept.
1954.
This year, the designs of the "target" sequences are changed. 1954's released cartoons that were part of the 1953-1954 season still had the old designs of the ending sequences. The designs of the ending titles would change (starting with "By Word of Mouse").
1958.
Eddie Selzer sold his cartoon studio to Warner Bros. in 1958, and retired as producer, succeeded by John Burton, Sr. after Whoa, Be-Gone! was released.

<doc id="18792966" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18792966" title="Hindolam">
Hindolam

Hindōḷaṃ is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is an "audava" rāgam (or "owdava" rāgam, meaning pentatonic scale). It is a "janya" rāgam (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven "swaras" (musical notes). Hindolam is not the same as the Hindustani Hindol. The equivalent of "Hindolam" in Hindustani music is "Malkauns" (or Malkosh ).
It is known to be a rāgam that is generally beautiful and soothing to listen to. Being symmetrical in its ascending and descending scales, it lends itself very well to improvisation and is therefore popular at concerts.
Structure and Lakshana.
"Hindōḷaṃ" is a symmetric rāgam that does not contain "rishabham" and "panchamam". It is a pentatonic scale ("audava-audava" rāgam in Carnatic music classification - "audava" means 'of 5'). Since pentatonic scales can be found in other world music such as Chinese music, shades of "Mohanam" and "Hindōḷaṃ" can sometimes be traced in Chinese and east Asian music. Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
This rāgam uses the "swaras sadharana gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, shuddha dhaivatam" and "kaisiki nishadam". "Hindolam" is not a "melakarta" rāgam, since it does not contain all the seven "svaras".
Experts in Carnatic music hold differences of opinion on the "janaka" rāgams (rāgams of origin) that should be attributed to "Hindolam". It is widely accepted that 20th melakarta, "Natabhairavi" is the parent rāgam of "Hindolam", but some would like to associate it with 8th melakarta, "Hanumatodi". It can be derived from both, by dropping the "rishabham" and "panchamam".
Popular Compositions.
"Sāmajavara gamanā" by the maestro Tyagaraja is the most popular composition in "Hindolam". "Mamavatu śri Sarasvati" by Mysore Vasudevachar is another popular composition. Here are some more "kritis" composed in Hindolam.
Numerous "bhajans, stotras, kritis" and film music numbers also have been composed in the "Hindolam" rāgam.
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Hindolam's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 4 other major pentatonic rāgams, namely, "Mohanam", "Shuddha Saveri", "Udayaravichandrika" (also known as "Shuddha Dhanyasi") and "Madhyamavati". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For more details and illustration of this concept refer "Graha bhedam on Mohanam".

Tetrad test

The tetrad test is a series of behavioral paradigms in which rodents treated with cannabinoids such as THC show effects. It is widely used for screening drugs that induce cannabinoid receptor-mediated effects in rodents. The four behavioral components of the tetrad are spontaneous activity, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia. Common assays for these behavioral paradigms are as follows:
Direct CB1 agonists, such as THC (the psychoactive component of marijuana), or WIN 55,212-2, have effects in all components of the tetrad and induce hypomotility, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia in rodents. Accordingly, all true "tetrad effects" are not observed following treatment with antagonists of CB1 such as rimonabant.

Quasideterminant

In mathematics, the quasideterminant is a replacement for the determinant for matrices with noncommutative entries. Example 2 × 2 quasideterminants are as follows:
In general, there are "n"2 quasideterminants defined for an "n" × "n" matrix (one for each position in the matrix), but the presence of the inverted terms above should give the reader pause: they are not always defined, and even when they are defined, they do not reduce to determinants when the entries commute. Rather, 
where formula_3 means delete the "i"th row and "j"th column from "A".
The formula_4 examples above were introduced between 1926 and 1928 by Richardson
but they were marginalized at the time because they were not polynomials in the entries of formula_5. These examples were rediscovered and given new life in 1991 by I.M. Gelfand and V.S. Retakh.
There, they develop quasideterminantal versions of many familiar determinantal properties. For example, if formula_6 is built from formula_5 by rescaling its formula_8-th row (on the left) by formula_9, then formula_10. 
Similarly, if formula_6 is built from formula_5 by adding a (left) multiple of the formula_13-th row to another row, then formula_14. They even develop a quasideterminantal 
version of Cramer's rule.
Definition.
Let formula_5 be an formula_16 matrix over a (not necessarily commutative) 
ring formula_17 and fix formula_18. Let formula_19
denote the (formula_20)-entry of formula_5, let formula_22 denote the formula_8-th row of formula_5 with column formula_25 deleted, and let formula_26 denote the formula_25-th column of formula_5 with row formula_8 deleted. The (formula_20)-quasideterminant of formula_5 is defined if the submatrix formula_3 is invertible over formula_17. In this case, 
Recall the formula (for commutative rings) relating formula_35 to the determinant, namely formula_36. The above definition is a generalization in that (even for noncommutative rings) one has
whenever the two sides makes sense.
Identities.
One of the most important properties of the quasideterminant is what Gelfand and Retakh 
call the “heredity principle.” It allows one to take a quasideterminant in 
stages (and has no commutative counterpart). To illustrate, suppose
is a block matrix decomposition of an formula_16 matrix formula_5 with 
formula_41 a formula_42 matrix. If the (formula_20)-entry of formula_5 lies within formula_41, it says that 
That is, the quasideterminant of a quasideterminant is a quasideterminant! To put it less succinctly: UNLIKE determinants, quasideterminants treat matrices with block-matrix entries no differently than ordinary matrices (something determinants cannot do since block-matrices generally don't commute with one another). That is, while the precise form of the above identity is quite surprising, the existence of "some" such identity is less so. 
Other identities from the papers are (i) the so-called “homological relations,” stating that two quasideterminants in a common row or column are closely related to one another, and (ii) the Sylvester formula.
(i) Two quasideterminants sharing a common row or column satisfy
or
respectively, for all choices formula_49, formula_50 so that the 
quasideterminants involved are defined. 
(ii) Like the heredity principle, the Sylvester identity is a way to recursively 
compute a quasideterminant. To ease notation, we display a special case. Let 
formula_51 be the upper-left formula_42 submatrix of an 
formula_53 matrix formula_5 and fix a coordinate (formula_20) in 
formula_51. Let formula_57 be the formula_58 matrix, with formula_59 defined as the (formula_60)-quasideterminant of the formula_61 matrix formed by adjoining to formula_51 the first formula_13 columns of row formula_64, the first formula_13 rows of column formula_66, and the entry formula_67formula_68. Then one has
Many more identities have appeared since the first articles of Gelfand and Retakh on the subject, most of them being analogs of classical determinantal identities. An important source is Krob and Leclerc's 1995 article, 
formula_71. 
Well, it happens that quasideterminants satisfy
(expansion along column formula_25), and
(expansion along row formula_8).
Connections to other determinants.
The quasideterminant is certainly not the only existing determinant analog for noncommutative settings—perhaps the most famous examples are the Dieudonné determinant and quantum determinant. However, these are related to the quasideterminant in some way. For example,
with the factors on the right-hand side commuting with each other. Other famous examples, such as Berezinians, Moore and Study determinants, Capelli determinants, and Cartier-Foata-type determinants are also expressible in terms of quasideterminants. Gelfand has been known to define a (noncommutative) determinant as “good” if it may be expressed as products of quasiminors.
Applications.
Paraphrasing their 2005 survey article with S. Gelfand and R. Wilson 
Gelfand and Retakh advocate for the adoption of
quasideterminants as “a main organizing tool in noncommutative algebra, giving
them the same role determinants play in commutative algebra.” By now,
substantive use has been made of the quasideterminant in such fields of mathematics as
integrable systems,
representation theory,
algebraic combinatorics,
the theory of "noncommutative symmetric functions," 
the theory of "polynomials over division rings," 
and noncommutative geometry.
Several of the applications above make use of "quasi-Plücker coordinates," which parametrize noncommutative Grassmannians and flags in much the same way as Plücker coordinates do Grassmannians and flags over commutative fields. More information on these can be found in the survey article.

What They Play

What They Play was a video game-centric website aimed at helping parents learn about content in video games, helping them decide what games their children should play. It was the first of several websites to launch under "What They Like, Inc.", other sites featuring books, movies and music followed.
The site was launched in 2007 by two former Ziff Davis members Ira Becker, executive vice-president of the Game Group, and ex-1UP.com writer and Senior vice-president of the Game Group John Davison. Davison announced his departure from Ziff in August 2007, with Becker's announcement soon following. The two raised over $3 million to fund the creation and launch of the site. The site was launched in beta in on November 12, 2007.
On September 24, 2009 the site was acquired by News Corporation. As of September 2011, the site no longer appears operational, and all links redirect to IGN.com or its affiliates. The site's Twitter account has been inactive since February 2011, though no official word of closure exists; it is unclear when and why the website shut down.
Format.
The site contained a database of over 16,000 games divided by console, genre and ESRB rating. The site employed a small editorial staff of seven to play and review games based on their content, but also allowed parents to leave comments and reviews under each game describing their thoughts on the game's content and/or their child's reaction to the game. Parents could also submit an age-appropriateness rating, assigned on a scale from 1-17.

Stanegarth was built in 1910 as a steam powered tugboat by Lytham Ship Builders Company for service with the British Waterways Board. She was converted to diesel power in 1957. The tug used to tow three dredging hoppers, each crewed by two men, on the trip to and from Gloucester to Purton.
On 6 June 2000 she was scuttled at Stoney Cove to produce an artificial reef suitable for wreck diving. The wreck now sits in of fresh water and measures more than long with a beam of . A plaque attached to it reads "Stanegarth project by Stoney Cove and Diver Magazine June 2008".

Kanakangi

Kanakangi (pronounced kanakāngi, meaning "the golden bodied one") is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 1st "Melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Kanakāmbari in the Muthuswami Dikshitar school.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is 1st rāgam in the 1st "chakra Indu". The mnemonic name is "Indu-Pa". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra ga ma pa dha na". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) has all "shuddha swaras", as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
It is a "sampurna" rāgam – a rāgam that has all seven "swaras" (notes). It is the "shuddha madhyamam" equivalent of "Salagam", which is the 37th "melakarta".
Asampurna Melakarta.
Kanakāmbari is the 1st "Melakarta" in the original list compiled by Venkatamakhin. The notes used in the scale are the same, but the ascending scale is different. It is an "audava-sampurna" raga (5 notes in ascending scale, while full 7 are used in descending scale).
"Janya" rāgams.
"Kanakangi" has a few "janya" ragams associated with it, of which "Karnātaka shuddha sāveri" and "Lavangi" (a recent addition to Carnatic music by Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna) are a little popular. See List of "janya" rāgams for a full list of "Kanakangi's janyas".
Popular Compositions.
"Sri Gananatham Bhajamyaham" is one of the few compositions in this austere ragam, by Thyagaraja, one of the most important composers in the history of Indian music. Also, Koteeswara Iyer has composed a krithi in this raga, he having composed in every "melakarta" raga.
Another important composition is that of Muthuswamy Dikshitar – "kanakAmbari kAruNyAmRtalahari" in the rāgam KanakAmbari.
The popular Tamil movie Sindhu Bhairavi has a song "Moham ennum", in this ragam "Kanakangi".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Kanakangi's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields "Kamavardani". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For further details and an illustration refer "Graha bhedam on Kanakangi".

State-assisted suicide

State-assisted suicide is the use of government to commit suicide. It is usually performed by committing a capital crime and receiving a capital punishment.
State-assisted suicide was a popular method in Medieval and Enlightenment Era Scandinavia, where religion forbade suicide and suicidees were prohibited from religious burial. The usual method was to kill an infant - infanticide was a capital crime; and infants, once baptized, were considered to be pure and sinless and therefore certain to receive salvation. The death penalty, usually by beheading, gave the condemned a chance to atone his or her sins before death. This was also common in the German states of the same period; several states outlawed the practice, but to no avail.
Timothy McVeigh, who had contemplated suicide in the past, notably called his execution "state-assisted suicide." Zacarias Moussaoui also sought to kill himself through the justice system. A typical strategy for this purpose is to commit a capital offense and then refuse to plea bargain in the face of overwhelming evidence, all the while showing no remorse and making statements calculated to cause grave offense.
Amnesty International said "While "volunteer" executions are sometimes referred to as a form of state-assisted suicide, "prisoner-assisted homicide" would be a more accurate label."

Neston Park

Neston Park is an English country house and estate, 2 miles (3 km) south of Corsham, Wiltshire, in the village of Neston. The name of the village comes from the name of the house.
The house was built just after 1790.
Since the early 19th century, it has been the home of the Fuller family, known for their participation in the Fuller, Smith and Turner brewery in London, producer of "Fuller's London Pride" cask ale. 
In 1910, Neston Park proprietor John Fuller, a politician, was created a baronet on the recommendation of the Asquith government.
Baronetcies are hereditary, and James Fuller became the proprietor, estate manager and fourth Baronet in 1998.
The grounds of the house contain farmland: the estate extends from north of Neston village, southwards beyond Atworth, to South Wraxall, and includes the certified organic home farm with a herd of Jersey cattle and unusual Aberdeen Angus and Jersey cross-bred cattle.
Noted explorer of Africa, John Hanning Speke, a nephew of the Fuller family, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while hunting partridge at Neston Park in 1864.
In the late 1990s, the estate obtained a Countryside Stewardship Scheme agreement from the government, supporting a programme of hedge, wall and wild flower field margin restoration.
The estate's farm shop and coffee shop were established in Atworth in 2006.
The estate has been used as the filming location of a number of productions, including the outdoor sets for the 2008 BBC television adaptation of "Lark Rise to Candleford", and some scenes of the ITV series "Persuasion".
Unlike the neighbouring estate of Great Chalfield Manor, occupied by other members of the Fuller family, Neston Park is not open to the public, though several public paths cross the land. 
The route of the ancient Roman road from London to Bath crosses the home farm from east to west, about 200 metres (700 feet) south of the house.
The local portion of the road is sometimes known as the Wansdyke.
In 2011 the estate applied for planning permission to reopen a Bath Stone mine, called Park Lane quarry, on the estate.

Hands to Heaven

"Hands to Heaven" is the title of a popular song released in 1987 and peaking on the charts in 1988 (see 1988 in music) by the English pop group Breathe. The song was written by group members David Glasper (lead vocals), Karoushtopher Stark, and Marcus Lillington (guitar, keyboard).
Although it was released as the first single from the group's debut album "All That Jazz", "Hands to Heaven" was not Breathe's debut single; the group had recorded and released songs prior to signing an album deal with A&M Records. One of these songs, "Don't Tell Me Lies", reached #77 on the UK Singles Chart in 1986 before being included on Breathe's debut album and subsequently being reissued.
"Hands to Heaven" was, however, Breathe's breakthrough hit in both the UK as well as the United States. The ballad peaked at #4 on the UK Singles Chart in August 1988. In the US, it logged two weeks at #2 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart that same month (kept from the summit by "Roll with It" by Steve Winwood) and spent 16 weeks in the Top 40. "Hands to Heaven" also peaked at #2 on the "Billboard" adult contemporary chart.
The song reached #4 in Norway and #14 in Sweden.
This song was one of a number of singles, many by British and Australian bands, that helped to shape the smooth jazz radio format in the US in the mid to late 1980s. Other associated artists include Swing Out Sister, Johnny Hates Jazz, Icehouse and Sade.

North Columbia, California

North Columbia was a California Gold Rush town on the San Juan Ridge in Nevada County, California. Originally known as Columbia, Columbia Hill, or The Hill because of its proximity to Columbia Hill, it started as a gold miners' camp around 1851. When a Post Office was established on May 29, 1860, the word "North" was added in order to differentiate the settlement from Columbia, California, another gold rush town in Tuolumne County, California.
In 1878, when miners discovered that the Pliocene gravel bed upon which the town was built contained rich gold deposits, North Columbia was moved to its present location. But with the eventual curtailment of hydraulic mining, miners moved away. The post office closed in 1931.
Eventually, North Columbia became an unincorporated part of Nevada City, California.

Crime in Cincinnati

Crime in Cincinnati, Ohio has been a concern of residents since the 18th century.
Earliest years.
The first recorded crime in Cincinnati's history was a petty theft in 1789. Under the judgement of William McMillan, informally appointed justice of the peace, one Patrick Grimes was sentenced to twenty-nine lashes after being caught stealing cucumbers. This occurred during the first year of the settlement, then still named "Losantiville", at which time food and other resources were extremely scarce. Controversies over law enforcement quickly followed the establishment of government in the community: the military commander at Fort Washington deemed the region to be under his government, rejecting any authority set up by the settlers. When a second crime was reported to Judge McMillan, the accused fled to the fort for refuge, and the commander ordered Losantiville's court to renounce its jurisdiction. To this the judge replied with a message suggesting that the commander mind his own business, and blows ensued when a detachment of soldiers was sent to arrest the judge. However, permanent civilian law enforcement was established soon after the incident. In August 1788, the Northwest Territory legislature, meeting in Marietta, had enacted an enabling act creating a Court of Quarter Sessions for the region, and local residents quickly took advantage of the law's provisions; William McMillan was named one of the court's first judges.
Crime dynamics.
Before the riot of 2001, Cincinnati's overall crime rate was dropping dramatically and had reached its lowest point since 1992. After the riot violent crime increased. Reflecting national trends, crime rates in Cincinnati have dropped in all categories from 2006 to 2010.
In 2011, using FBI data, the CQ Press ranked Cincinnati the 16th most dangerous city in the United States. However, the FBI web site recommends against using its data for rankings, since there are many factors that influence crime rates. Also, the CQ Press did not include Chicago, Illinois in its ranking.
According to the Hamilton County Prosecutor, the vast majority of people being murdered are inside the city and African American. In 2009, 44 black men and 11 black women were murdered, but no whites. According to the Prosecutor, people almost always commit murders inside their racial classifications, and there is a subset in the underclass of Cincinnati which "commit a lot of violent crime and tend to be black."
Distribution by Neighborhood.
During the first half of 2008 approximately half of the most serious crimes (i.e. murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft) were concentrated in 10 of the 53 Cincinnati neighborhoods. 
The neighborhoods with the highest percentage of these crimes were East Westwood, Downtown, South Fairmount, North Fairmount, and English Woods. The neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of these crimes were Mount Adams, West End, O'Bryonville, Riverside, and College Hill.

MV Mississippi

The M/V "Mississippi" is a United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) towboat operating on the Mississippi River. It is the largest diesel towboat on the river.
Working boat.
The M/V "Mississippi" is a working towboat for the USACE Memphis District. Ninety percent of the time it is moving barges, equipment and supplies in support of mat sinking operations. It also serves as an inspection boat for the Mississippi River Commission (MRC) during a high- and low-water inspection trip each year. Commissioners hold meetings at river towns in the boat's hearing room, which can seat 115 people. Its dining room has a capacity of 85 people. The boat has 22 staterooms and can handle 150 passengers. The Corps also uses it as a "giant floating ambassador".
During the Hurricane Katrina crisis, the "Mississippi" was moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi and used as a floating command center.
Predecessors.
There have been five USACE vessels of this name.
"Mississippi".
Steamer "Mississippi" was built in St. Louis in 1882. It was used by the MRC for its spring and fall inspection trips from St. Louis to New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1919 it was renamed the "Piomingo" after being transferred to what is now the Memphis District, where it served as a towboat for many more years.
"Mississippi II".
Steamer "Leota" was built in 1899 as a dredge tender. Selected in 1920 as the new MRC inspection vessel, two years later it was rebuilt and re-designated "Mississippi".
"Mississippi III".
Steamer "Mississippi" was a sternwheel, steam driven boat that was based upon the "Mississippi II". After Mississippi II's hull and machinery were determined to no longer be serviceable in 1926, a new hull, boilers, and engines were built at Jeffersonville, Indiana. In 1927, the cabin from its predecessor was moved atop the new hull at Paducah, Kentucky. Used for inspecting and surveying along rivers, the boat continued in service until April 1961, when the USACE decommissioned it at Memphis, Tennessee. Converted to a museum and restaurant, it was in Saint Louis, Missouri until 1975. While in Missouri, it was renamed Becky Thatcher, after a character in Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer". It was then moved to Marietta, Ohio, where it was the Showboat Becky Thatcher restaurant and theater from 1975 until it was evicted from there and moved to Neville Island near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 17, 2009. The boat was of particular interest because it was the last of the Texas-deck sternwheelers. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 21, 1983. On the night of February 19, 2010, during severe winter weather conditions, the showboat "Becky Thatcher" sank at its mooring on Neville Island in the Ohio River. Demolition of the boat began on Monday, March 8, 2010. It was completely demolished and destroyed not long after that.
"Mississippi IV".
Motor Vessel "Mississippi" was a diesel-powered vessel with an all-steel superstructure. Powered by two 8-cylinder engines, each of 1860 horsepower, for extra maneuverability it used controllable pitch propellers which allowed it to generate a reverse thrust of over 70% in the forward direction. The four levels on the superstructure were the main deckhouse, second deckhouse, Texas deckhouse, and the pilothouse. It served as a towboat and inspection vessel until decommissioned in 1993. On September 26, 2007 it was moved to its permanent location on land at what will be the Lower Mississippi River Museum in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

<doc id="18793201" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18793201" title="Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad">
Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad

The Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad is a Mosque in Cairo, Egypt next to Bab Zuwayla built by the Mamluk sultan Al-Mu'ayyad Sayf ad-Din Shaykh from whom it takes its name. Construction began in 1415 and the mosque was completed in 1421. The complex included a Friday mosque and a madrasa for four madhhabs. It replaced a prison which originally stood next to Bab Zuwayla.
History.
Sultan al-Mu'ayyad.
In keeping with Mamluk custom, al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh was purchased by Sultan Al-Malik Az-Zahir Sayf ad-Din Barquq when he was ten or twelve years old. As an adult, he served for ten years as the governor of Tripoli under an appointment by Sultan An-Nasir Naseer ad-Din Faraj.
The historian Al-Maqrizi relates the future Sultan al-Mu'ayyad was imprisoned in the same prison which the mosque replaced as while an emir under Sultan Faraj. Shaykh suffered so terribly from fleas and lice during his imprisonment, he vowed that he would transform the prison into "a saintly place for the education of scholars" if he ever came to power. True to his word, when he became Sultan he commissioned the mosque.
In 1412, Shaykh assisted in overthrowing Sultan Faraj, and within six months, he seized power and became the new Sultan. He took the title al-Mu'ayyad and began to expand his empire through battles against neighboring territories. As sultan, al-Mu'ayyad led a number of successful campaigns to northern Syria, as well as fighting Turkoman neighbors in Anatolia. He advanced as far as Konya before having to return to Cairo. Sultan al-Mu'ayyad's reign was plagued by troubles: the Bubonic plague, currency devaluation, and rebellious bedouins all disturbed his reign. Despite this, the Sultan still managed to oversee the building of the mosque, which is recognized today as one of Cairo's signature landmarks.
Under the sultan's sponsorship, the madrasa within the mosque became one of the most prominent academic institutions Cairo in the fifteenth century. The lavish endowment left by the sultan upon his death allowed the madrasa to hire the most eminent scholars of the day as professors. The most famous Quranic specialist in Egypt, Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani, lectured in Shafi'i jurisprudence at the madrasa.
Sultan al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh died in 1421, eleven years after he took power. Throughout his reign, he gained a reputation as a humble man and as one of the great patrons of architecture in Cairo. On his death, the sultan left behind several religious and secular monuments, including a khanqah in Giza, palaces along the Khalij and the Nile, and the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad.
Construction.
Construction of the mosque began in May 1415. The project was an ambitious one, costing the sultan 40,000 dinars between commencement and completion. According to al-Maqrizi, thirty builders and one hundred workers labored on the structure over seven years.
The mosque required such a large quantity of marble that some of it was harvested from pre-existing structures. Besides marble, many other parts of the mosque were cannibalized from other buildings, including the mosque's columns and a beautiful bronze door and chandelier. The door and chandelier are particularly famous instances of this; both are said to have come from the Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan. Removing parts of current mosques was illegal while the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad was being built, so taking the door and chandelier were tanamount to stealing, despite donations the Sultan made to the old mosque. Although the new mosque was not officially completed until 1422, an inaugural celebration was held in November 1419 to celebrate the new building.
Even after the official conclusion of the mosque's construction, a number of structures in the original plans were never built. The dome of the second mausoleum attached to the mosque was never completed. A separate building for use as dormitories by Sufi students who studied at the madrasa were not immediately erected, despite an allocation of 20,000 dinars toward them. Later mosque records are unclear as to whether the Sufi dormitories were later completed as plans, though the students definitely were given space in which to live.
Purpose.
The mosque was intended as a funerary complex and for use in Friday prayers, but its greatest purpose was that of a madrasa for Sufi students, according to al-Maqrizi's story of its origins. The madrasa was devoted to the study of the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of Sharia law. According to the mosque's original documents, the madrasa was to house fifty Hanafis, forty Shafi'is, fifteen Malikis, and ten Hanbalis, and their respective teachers and imams. There were also two classes of twenty students each for students of tafsir and Hadith, and two others of ten each for students of the Quran recitation and legal studies, according to the Hanafi jurist al-Tahawi.
Architecture and Appearance.
Exterior.
The Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad was the last great hypostyle mosque built in Cairo. Originally it had four facades and entrances. Over time, the mosque fell into disrepair, and today only the eastern facade and the prayer hall are original to the mosque. Much of what can be seen today has been restored over the past two hundred years and is not necessarily how the mosque originally looked.
In order to build the mosque, a portion of the Fatimid wall which used to surround Cairo had to be demolished; however, an old section of the wall was recently discovered within the mosque's structure and can be seen today by visitors. Two towers from the original wall were saved from demolition and serve as the base of the mosque's two remaining minarets.
The main portal, or muqarnas is set in a pistaq, or rectangular frame, that rises above the mosque's facade. This was the last grand portal built in the Mamluk period; it is framed with to the mosque is decorated with finely carved marble bands and kufic calligraphic script. The marble was carved in a geometric pattern and decorated by polychromatic stones and colored stucco in high relief. The main door is a masterpiece of bronze work taken from the Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan, while the dome is a typical example of Mamluk stone masonry with a cylindrical base and carved zig-zag pattern. The original facades were particularly tall for the period, due to the extra height added by the Fatimid towers at the base of the minarets. The facades were decorated with two rows of windows, and shops beneath each wall of the mosque were added in the original plans and remain today. The shops attached to and around the mosque play an important role in the mosque's upkeep, as a percentage of their earnings go toward maintaining the building and its staff.
Originally, the mosque was intended to include a symmetrical pair of domed mausoleums flanking a prayer hall; this ambition was curbed when the dome of the second mausoleum was not completed. On either side of the prayer hall are funerary chambers, housing the Sultan and his son in one and female members of the Sultan's family in the other. The Sultan's chamber has a domed ceiling, as originally planned, while the women's chamber has a plain flat ceiling. This dome is a reduced copy of Faraj's twin domes; because of the large size of the mosque, the dome appears disproportionately small in its setting.
Interior.
The sanctuary of the mosque was one of the most richly decorated of its time; wall decoration was limited to the prayer hall, which was decorated with polychromatic marble high enough to include window and mihrab recesses. The marble columns are pre-Islamic and have diverse sizes and shapes, since they were drawn from structures across Cairo and the surrounding territories. Floors were paved with polychrome marble in the sanctuary and courtyard, although the minor riwaqs were paved with stone. Interestingly, the prayer hall includes two blind windows decorated either in the Andalusian or Moroccan style, one in a geometric pattern and the other in floral.
The mihrab and minbar are both decorated in a typical period style. The minbar is decorated with finely carved wooden doors and panels, and above the minbar is a large rosette of polychrome marble. This is particularly unique because this style is usually used on a floor, rather than upon a wall.
The funerary chambers are largely plain, although there are cenotaphs running along the wall and carved in marble. The largest of these cenotaphs is a quote from the Qur'an in Kufic script reading "Surely those who avoid evil will be among gardens and fountains: enter them in peace, secure" (Qur'an 15:45-46). Both funerary chambers have shallow mihrabs on their walls facing the lesser riwaqs. These mihrabs were likely used by people praying within each riwaq, especially in the case of overflow during peak prayer times.
Other rooms in the mosque included a library, which was itself known for its collection of books. The majority of books in the library came directly from the Citadel's royal collection. Five hundred others were donated by the sultan's private secretary, Muhammad al-Barizi. For this contribution, al-Barizi's son was appointed as the mosque's preacher and librarian. Donations similar to this were common among high-level bureaucrats in the hope that they might gain similar favor with the Sultan.
The mosque has a remarkably large pavilion compared to other mosques in the area with an ablutions fountain in the centre. The original fountain was said to have marble columns roofed with a gilded wooden dome above an awning, adding to the building's splendor. On the western side of the mosque, there are the ruins of a hammam.
Inside the minarets are carved cartouches signed and dated by the architect upon the completion of each. This is particularly rare; it is very uncommon for an architect to leave his mark on a building in this era. The eastern minaret reads that the "ma'dhana" (or minaret) was built by Muhammad Ibn al-Qazzaz and was finished in August 1419. The western minaret is slightly different, reading that the Sultan al-Mu'ayyad ordered the construction of two "manars" (minarets) and that they were executed by Muhammad Ibn al-Qazzaz and completed in August 1420. Scholars are unsure as to why two different words for minaret were used in each inscription, and it remains a small mystery of the building. There was also a third minaret at the West portal to the street, but it fell into disrepair and was never rebuilt.
Renovations.
Throughout its history, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad has undergone extensive renovations. Even early on, reconstruction was necessary. According to al-Maqrizi, the eastern minaret had to be pulled down and rebuilt as early as 1418 due to structural insecurity from its tower base. Another three-story minaret stood at the Western portal on a side street; it collapsed in 1427 during Sultan Barsbay's reign and was immediately rebuilt.
By the nineteenth century, the mosque had fallen into such disrepair that all that remained was one facade, the prayer hall, and the mausoleums. Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Muhammad 'Ali, oversaw restorations in the late 1830s and 1840s, including the installation of Turkish tiles in the qibla wall. In the late nineteenth century, the Comité de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe rebuilt the western facade and turned the courtyard into a garden.
In 2001, the mosque again underwent restorations, this time by the order of the Egyptian Ministry of Culture. These restorations removed the garden from the courtyard and rebuilt the majority of the mosque, including missing arcades around the courtyard. This project has restored the mosque and its results can be seen today; however, visitors should note that what they see is not necessarily what the mosque looked like in its original form.

<doc id="18793220" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18793220" title="Alun Davies (guitarist)">
Alun Davies (guitarist)

Alun Davies is a Welsh guitarist, studio musician, recording artist, and composer who rose to fame primarily with his supporting guitar work and backing vocals as accompanist for English musician Cat Stevens, from early 1970 to 1977.
Prior to his association with Stevens, Davies co-wrote, sang, and performed on two albums: in 1963, with Jon Mark, (known then as John Michael Burchell) and in 1968, as a part of a band with Mark and three others called Sweet Thursday, when folk-rock music was still in its infancy. When their label declared bankruptcy, Davies was invited to join Cat Stevens as a session musician, who was attempting to change his sound and advance in the music world.
Davies' experience, similar tastes in the emerging folk-rock genre, and capabilities with guitar and voice placed him in a pivotal role in Stevens' career, resulting in hit songs and a string of RIAA platinum certified breakthrough albums. Two such albums, "Tea for the Tillerman" and "Teaser and the Firecat", propelled Stevens to stardom and a stellar musical career, and solidified a friendship between the two men. Davies, who recorded a solo album after a few years of backing Stevens found comparatively little commercial success on his own, particularly after several years of sitting in Stevens' charismatic shadow. He continued to tour with him and recorded on all but one of his albums, until Stevens' conversion to Islam and retirement from the pop scene in 1977. Since that time, many "box sets", compilations, and "best hits" albums have been assembled for sale with Davies' guitar work and vocals on each album.
In late 2005, when Stevens (now known as Yusuf Islam) returned again to write and perform, he did so with the amicable support of his friend and long-time right hand man Davies, although nearly three decades had passed, and the two men had followed extremely different paths during the interim. Davies continues to perform with Yusuf to the present day, in addition to pursuing other musical projects.
Early musical career.
Alun Davies began his musical career playing skiffle music on a ukulele and then a "very cheap" acoustic guitar. Eventually he advanced, and met up with former schoolfriend Michael Burchell, who later assumed the stage name of Jon Mark. The two young men composed and performed songs together, and by 1963, just two years out of school, had been signed by Decca Records. They recorded their first album, "Relax Your Mind", in one day with American producer Shel Talmy, who had worked with bands that include the Who, Chad and Jeremy, the Kinks, Manfred Mann, and Ralph McTell. The two set about busking in Europe and located an agent who found them a position performing on a Cunard Line ship, sailing sixteen times across the Atlantic. After a time, the two had enough of sailing. Davies was content playing as a session musician for Fontana Records, touring with some musicians of note including Spencer Davis. Davies was additionally recruited as a record producer for a folk album from Jeremy Taylor, with whom Davies guested on two songs.
Sweet Thursday.
Davies and Mark reunited in 1968, forming a band with Nicky Hopkins as keyboardist, bass guitarist Harvey Burns, and drummer Brian Odgers, under the name Sweet Thursday. The eponymous album that resulted was released, but never had a chance with the public. Their American record label, Tetragrammaton Records, abruptly declared bankruptcy (by legend, the same day the album was released), and the musicians never had the opportunity to perform their new material on stage or promote the album. 
Davies returned to session work in the music industry. For a time, Davies played in folk clubs, one being the "hub" of folk music in London, the Cecil Sharp House. He also gave guitar lessons to support himself. "I began concentrating more on my guitar playing. I then found there was a lot of session work available for a fingerstyle acoustic player", he said to "Beat Instrumental Magazine". He continued to write new material of his own, with hopes of a solo album in the future.
With Cat Stevens.
Davies was first recruited to work with Cat Stevens in early 1970, by Stevens' producer, Paul Samwell-Smith. He was considered a perfect complement to Stevens' new, folk-rock based approach to music, and the combination clicked. Initially hired as a session musician on the album "Mona Bone Jakon", Davies' more experienced guitar "finger-work" and backing vocals assisted Stevens to achieve his new sound. He had a hit single from the album with the song "Lady D'Arbanville", a madrigal-sounding song written about Stevens' girlfriend at the time, which ultimately reached #8 on the pop charts in the United Kingdom, and is credited as the first Cat Stevens song to gain attention in the United States. The song and the album laid the groundwork for Stevens' most productive albums to come. Davies had developed a love for the emerging folk-rock sound, as had Stevens. After they completed "Mona Bone Jakon", within six weeks' time had already begun to work on "Tea for the Tillerman".
Wooing the American audience.
As his accompanist on Stevens' first tour of the United States, Davies said that the two experienced some stage fright, upon hearing that they'd be opening for Steve Winwood's band, Traffic, at the Fillmore East. However, the concert was a hit, and had three standing ovations, bolstering both the confidence of the band and the sales of Stevens' albums. Working alongside Stevens, Davies was a thoroughly essential partner in catapulting Stevens into world-fame. Within a short time, Davies was regarded by astute fans as a perfectionist, arriving before Stevens at each concert to personally check out both the sound and instruments after the sound checks, and practicing the material until he was satisfied that the audience would receive the best concert available. Such finishing touches kept him the most essential member of Stevens' artistic team.
"Tea for the Tillerman" and "Teaser and the Firecat" both were platinum albums in the United States, and each produced top charting singles. Lauded as Stevens' right-hand man, Davies put off his dreams of solo albums because he insisted that Stevens' work was more essential, and he remained loyal to him, saying he would eventually find time for his own project.
In 1972, Davies' at last found the time and opportunity to launch his own solo album. "Daydo" was released in 1972, containing songs written or co-written by Davies, and supported by Stevens on piano with other members of Cat Stevens' band, including drummer Gerry Conway. "Daydo" was Davies' nickname until age 18. The album was produced by Stevens and Paul Samwell-Smith. The solo effort received mixed reviews.
Reaction to Stevens' conversion.
After Cat Stevens left the pop music business, Davies confessed feeling quite sad. He stated that after being so fortunate to have attached himself to a "major talent" for so long that there was a period of time that he mourned, as did quite a few others. The musicians in Stevens' band were an unusually positive assemblage of dedicated professionals who became fast friends. Davies commented that he hadn't seen this major change in Stevens' life coming, since Stevens' search for spiritual fulfillment had led him to experiment with all kinds of religions, including Numerology, Buddhism, I-Ching, and more. Stevens' mother was a Swedish Baptist, and father, a Greek Cypriot who was Greek Orthodox, and Stevens himself had been schooled in a Catholic school. Thus, Davies said in an interview that covered Cat Stevens' career on the Vh1's series, "Behind the Music", that he thought he was merely going through another phase right up until the last month or so.
1977 to 2005.
Davies then moved on to session work again and soon was composing songs and performing with vocalist Ronnie Lane who was an old friend and former member of the English bands, The Faces and the Small Faces. Together, the two co-wrote and recorded the opening track for Lane's upcoming album, "See Me", as well as "One Step", and another tune, "She's Leaving", in 1979.
Current work.
With the re-emergence of Yusuf Islam back on stage, Davies has spent the majority of his time performing and recording with him, and does so to the present day.
Davies also currently performs with the group Good Men in the Jungle with his former bandmate from their Cat Stevens days, drummer Gerry Conway. Conway, also formerly of Jethro Tull, plays most often with Fairport Convention). Others in this band include Davies' daughter, Becky Moncurr.
Discography.
"Daydo".
Alun Davies' only solo album as of 2008 was "Daydo", released in 1972. Much of the material was written as early as 1970, but this was just prior to Davies' introduction, backup work, and devoted friendship with Cat Stevens. With the intention of releasing the material as soon as possible, Davies bemoaned the fact that he had so little time to debut his own work, but stated that he had no regrets. The LP at last was released in the summer of 1972. Liner notes for the LP were written by Jon Mark, of Sweet Thursday and the Mark-Almond Band.

Escunta

Escunta is the fifth album by Canadian grindcore band Fuck the Facts. It was created and recorded in January 2001 at Total Bastard Studio. This release is different from most of the other Fuck the Facts releases because it is more focused on an experimental noise sound. In that sense, it is following the type of sound found on "Vagina Dancer".
When this was recorded, Fuck the Facts was still a solo project by Topon Das. However, at the time of this release, a full lineup had been established and "Mullet Fever" had already been released. It is unknown why it took more than a year to be released, but the original Fuck the Facts website states as of January 2001 (the same time it was recorded) that it was to be released on tape by R.U. Produkt. It is unknown if that ever happened.

Battle of Meelick Island

The Battle of Meelick Island took place on the river Shannon, on the border between Connacht and Leinster, in Ireland in October 1650. It was fought between the armies of Confederate Ireland and the English Parliament during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The battle occurred when an English force under Colonel Daniel Axtell attacked the Connacht Irish army led by Clanricarde. The result was the rout of the Connacht army by Axtell's soldiers.
Background.
The Parliamentarian capture of the Castle at Tecroghan enabled the English to approach the borders of Connacht during the summer of 1650. Ulick Burke, then Earl of Clanricarde, was forced into action by the impending threat. Clanricarde was the leading Irish commander in the province and by August recognised as the de facto successor to Ormond as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Clanricarde was a better diplomat than a military man, but he had maintained peace in Connacht during the turmoil of the 1640s. As the English armies approached the borders of Connacht, Clanricarde organised an army of 3,000 men to support Lord Dillon's garrison at Athlone. When Ireton marched south from Athlone in late September and early October, Clanricarde launched a counter-attack across the River Shannon, with the intention of cutting English communications between Athlone and Limerick and denying them supplies from King's County.
Clanricarde's forces crossed the Shannon at fords around Shannonbridge (to the south of Athlone) in early October. The Connacht army quickly captured Ferbane Castle and Colonel Axtell, the English commander in the region, was forced over the River Brosna and then to Birr after some skirmishes between his regiment and the Irish army. Clanricarde's forces then seized some small English outposts. As Axtell's regiment retreated, Clanricarde was reinforced by James Preston, bringing the strength of his army to just over 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. However, English reinforcements under Colonels Cook and Abbot quickly marched up from Wexford and Kilkenny to join Axtell at Roscrea on 21 October. When Axtell advanced towards Birr to challenge the Irish army, Clanricarde decided to withdraw and to take up formidable defensive positions on Meelick Island, a Crannog on the River Shannon.
The battle.
Soldiers were posted to overlook the ford that the English would have to cross in order to attack the Irish entrenchments on Meelick Island. Axtell however launched an attack as the light was fading on the evening of 25 October. The fighting was initially fierce, with clubbed muskets being used in close quarter fighting, but soon the Irish were driven from the forward post guarding the ford and the Parliamentarians gained an entrance to the island. The Irish were thereafter routed. Several hundred Irish soldiers were killed in the battle, many drowning in the waters of the Shannon as they tried to escape. The English captured Clanricarde's baggage train, including weapons, tents and many horses, though Burke himself escaped. The castle and posts taken by the Irish on the eastern side of the Shannon were quickly recaptured by the victorious Parliamentarians.
The rout at Meelick Island was a major blow to the Connacht Irish army, comparable to the loss of the Leinster army at Rathmines or the defeat of the Ulster army at Scarrifholis a few months before. Clanricarde attempted to put an army back together in subsequent months, but after this defeat he had great difficulty. After the battle it was alleged that Axtell's soldiers had executed many of the Irish soldiers after promise of quarter. As a result, Axtell was court-martialled by Ireton and ordered to return to England.

Balcom and Vaughan

Balcom and Vaughan Pipe Organ, Inc. was a builder of pipe organs based in Seattle until the early 1980's. The company was originally started in 1921 by C.M. "Sandy" Balcom, and Leroy "Pop" Vaughan both previously working for the Sherman Clay company. At the end of the silent film era Balcom and Vaughan began to focus more on building or altering church instruments. Instruments bearing Sandy's design influence were often smaller unit organs, even those of three manuals. It would not be unusual for them to contain a certain quantity of old pipe work or components from other redundant or altered instruments. As changes in taste began to lean more towards European inspired designs, Eugene "Gene" Nye was influential in inclining Balcom & Vaughan instruments of the 1960's towards that end. Some even possessing Dutch nomenclature at the console.
The return of William J. Bunch to Balcom and Vaughan after a period of time working for the Aeolian Skinner firm (1956-1966) as the Vice-President of production marked a zenith for the company. He took over the company when Sandy retired in 1966. Instruments from this period noted a certain classical style and a particular basic design, often with a complete chorus on the great, and frequently a bright unit reed (Hautbois). Metal pipe work and reeds was frequently sourced from the Jacques Stinkens firm of Zeist, Holland, or when the exchange rate not as favorable to the U.S. Dollar, to Thomas Anderson, also a former worker in the pipe shop of Aeolian Skinner. Later instruments might even contain pipework by A.R. Schopps Sons of Alliance, OH.
Upon the retirement of Bill Bunch, the company changed hands to John K. Moir. The company eventually closed down its Seattle shop when the lease was not renewed and the building located in the Greenlake neighborhood returned to the small theater (Meridian Theater Bldg.) it had once been. Tooling was also sold off and many long time employees did not remain on staff or retired when the remnants of the operation were moved to the Everett home of Moir.

Plebs' League

The Plebs' League was a British educational and political organisation which originated around Marxist ideals.
Central to the formation of the League was Noah Ablett, a miner from the Rhondda who was at the core of a group at Ruskin College, Oxford who opposed the lecturers' opposition to Marxism. In the 1907 - 8 academic year, Ablett began leading unofficial classes in Marxist political economy which were attended by Ebby Edwards, among others. Ablett returned to South Wales in 1908, where he began promoting Marxist education through local branches of the Independent Labour Party.
A mixture of students and former students at Ruskin founded the Plebs' League in November 1908, also launching the "Plebs' Magazine". In the first issue of the "Plebs", dated February 1909, Ablett contributed an article on the need for independent working class education. The League ran classes teaching Marxist principles and later syndicalist ideas.
During 1909, student agitation for Marxism continued at Ruskin. The students were supported by the Principal, Dennis Hird, and when he was dismissed the students went on strike, refusing to attend classes. The rebels formed the Central Labour College, which worked closely with the Plebs' League.
By 1910, the Plebs' League was active in South Wales, Lancashire and Scotland. Activists included A. J. Cook, William Mainwaring, Mark Starr and John Maclean.
The League had sympathies with De Leonism, primarily represented in Britain by the Socialist Labour Party. It later had a relationship with the Communist Party of Great Britain.
The League was absorbed by the National Council of Labour Colleges the year after the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, although the "Plebs' Magazine" continued to appear for many years.

John Pitura

John Pitura (born 21 September 1950) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with the South Melbourne and Richmond Football Clubs in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1970s.
Pitura was born in Wagga Wagga to a Polish father and as a child played rugby league. He was just 16 when he was recruited to South Melbourne by coach Norm Smith and he eventually made his league debut in 1969, ironically against Richmond. A left footed half forward flanker and centreman, Pitura represented Victoria at interstate football in 1973.
At the conclusion of the 1973 season, due to a strained relationship with the board, Pitura came close to leaving the club but remained on their books for the following year. He didn't play again until late July in 1974, after season long negations with South Melbourne. Richmond attempted to trade Pitura to their club at the year's end but the South Melbourne committee refused to clear him. After Pitura threatened to challenge the league's clearance rules in court, South Melbourne relented and traded him to Richmond in 1975. 
The trade saw Graham Teasdale, Brian Roberts and Francis Jackson come to South Melbourne. All three of them made an impact at their new club, Teasdale won the 1977 Brownlow, Roberts finished equal sixth in the 1975 Brownlow before walking out on the club and Jackson played 100 games. Pitura however struggled at Richmond and managed just three seasons. His last game was in the 1977 finals campaign where Richmond lost to North Melbourne in the Semi Final, having defeated Pitura's old club South Melbourne a week earlier in the Elimination Final.
Pitura joined New South Wales club North Shore in 1978 as captain-coach and steered them to the premiership. He also spent some years playing in Queensland for both Kedron and Coorparoo. In 1981 he finished runner-up in the Grogan Medal.

Mal Cochrane

Mal Cochrane (born 3 April 1961 in Taree, New South Wales) is an Indigenous Australian former professional rugby league player for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership. Cochrane primarily played at hooker.
Playing career.
Junior career.
Cochrane played hockey and cricket as well as rugby league while at school and represented his state in all three sports at schoolboy level.
Cochrane captained the Australian Schoolboys tour of England and France in 1979, scoring twelve tries and seven goals. He was also rated the best forward of the tour after playing at hooker, lock and prop.
Senior career.
Although he originally discussed a career with Canterbury-Bankstown following the 1979 tour, he signed with Manly-Warringah, the club of his childhood hero, Bob Fulton, who in 1983 would also become the Sea Eagles coach.
Cochrane played in one grand final with Manly, the 1987 Grand Final against the Canberra Raiders in the final ever Grand Final to be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Manly won the match 18-8, but after receiving a knee to the head in the first half, Cochrane remembered nothing of the game. Following the grand final victory he traveled with Manly to England for the 1987 World Club Challenge against English champions, Wigan. In a try-less game, the home side shocked the Winfield Cup premiers 8-2 in front of 36,895 fans at Central Park.
Injuries in the last years of Cochrane's first-grade career reduced his appearances to only 28 games over the final three seasons. Cochrane retired from first-grade at the end of the 1990 season and spent a year playing for the Young Cherrypickers in the NSW Group 9 competition.
Post-playing career.
In 1996, Cochrane coached the Australian Aboriginal rugby league team on their tour of Great Britain.
A policeman for ten years, Cochrane now works for the Public Service Association of New South Wales, assisting Indigenous Australians in the workplace and is a member of the National Rugby League Judiciary.
Accolades.
Cochrane was the first hooker to win the Rothmans Medal (awarded from 1968 to 1996), in 1986, and was considered unlucky to miss a spot on the 1986 Kangaroo Tour. Subsequent medal winning hookers include Danny Buderus and Cameron Smith. He was also awarded the Dally M "Hooker of the Year" in 1986 and 1987.
In August, 2008, Cochrane was named at hooker in the "Indigenous Team of the Century".

Celtic coinage

Celtic coinage was minted by the Celts from the late 4th century BC to the late 1st century BC. Celtic coins were influenced by trade with and the supply of mercenaries to the Greeks, and initially copied Greek designs, especially Macedonian coins from the time of Philip II of Macedon and his son, Alexander the Great.
Gaulish coinage.
Greek coinage occurred in three Greek cities of Massalia, Emporiae and Rhoda, and was copied throughout southern Gaul.
Northern Gaulish coins were especially influenced by the coinage of Philip II of Macedon and his famous son Alexander the Great. Celtic coins often retained Greek subjects, such as the head of Apollo on the obverse and two-horse chariot on the reverse of the gold stater of Philip II, but developed their own style from that basis, allowing for the development of a Graeco-Celtic synthesis.
After this first period in which Celtic coins rather faithfully reproduced Greek types, designs started to become more symbolic, as exemplified by the coinage of the Parisii in the Belgic region of northern France.
The Armorican Celtic style in northwestern Gaul also developed from Celtic designs from the Rhine valley, themselves derived from earlier Greek prototypes such as the wine scroll and split palmette.
The Boii gave their name to Bohemia and Bologna; a Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint is displayed on Slovak 5 koruna coin, which was in use until Slovakia joined the euro zone on January 1, 2009.
The images found on Celtic coins include giants trailing severed heads on rope, horsemen charging into battle, gods and goddesses, skulls and chariot wheels, thunderbolts and lightning, the sun and the moon. They are miniature masterpieces of surreal art.
A tribe of Celts called Eburones minted gold coins with triple spirals (a Celtic good luck symbol) on the front, and horses on the back.
The coins were either 'struck' or 'cast'. Both methods required a substantial degree of knowledge. Striking a blank coin formed in a clay was one way. After forming the blank, it would have been flattened out before striking with a die made from iron or bronze. The tiny details engraved on dies were just a few millimeters in diameter. Casting a coin required a different technique. They were produced by pouring molten alloy into a set of molds which were broken apart when the metal had cooled.
With the Roman invasion of Gaul, Greek-inspired Celtic coinage started to incorporate Roman influence instead, until it disappeared to be completely replaced by Roman coinage.
British Celtic coinage.
Traditional historians have tended to overlook the role played by Celtic coinage in the early history of British money. 
Over 45,000 of the ancient British and Gaulish coins discovered in Britain have been recorded at the Oxford Celtic Coin Index.

Lakan

Lakan originally referred to a rank in the pre-Hispanic Filipino nobility in the island of Luzon, which means "paramount ruler." It has been suggested that this rank is equivalent to that of Rajah, and that different ethnic groups either used one term or the other, or used the two words interchangeably. In Visayas and Mindanao, the most common term used to refer to this rank is "Datu". "Sultan" was also used in the most developed and complex Islamized principalities of Mindanao.
Today, the term is still occasionally used to mean "nobleman", but has mostly been adapted to other uses. In Filipino Martial Arts, Lakan denotes an equivalent to the black belt rank. Also, beauty contests in the Philippines have taken to referring to the winner as "Lakambini", the female equivalent of Lakan. In such cases, the contestant's assigned escort can be referred to as a Lakan. More often, a male pageant winner is named a Lakan.
Usage.
The title Lakan can be spelled separately from a person's name (e.g. "Lakan Dula"), or can be incorporated into a singly spelled word (e.g. "Lakandula").
Gat and Lakan. "Lakan" and "Gat" are often used interchangeably, since Gat (from the word "Pamagat", meaning "Title") refers to a person as a member of the nobility in general. Thus, someone like Lakandula is also named Gatdula.
Rajah and Lakan. It is sometimes argued that since the words Rajah and Lakan mean more or less the same thing, the two should not be used together. Thus, popular reference to Rajah Lakan Dula are said to be the result of mistaking Lakan Dula to be the full proper name of the historic king.
Prominent Lakans.
Users of the title Lakan that figure in 16th and 17th century Spanish colonial accounts of Philippine History include:
In popular culture.
The name of Malacañan Palace, the official residence of the President of the Republic of the Philippines, is traditionally attributed to the phrase "may lakan diyan", or "where the king head resided".

Amedei Porcelana

Amedei Porcelana, a dark chocolate made by the Amedei chocolatier of Tuscany, Italy, is often called the world's most expensive chocolate. It has won various awards, including "Best bean to bar", "Best Dark Chocolate Bar", and the "Golden Bean award." Amedei is and was, at the time of these awards, a sponsor of the awarding body's parent organization.
Manufacture.
Amedei Porcelana is made from translucent, white cocoa beans of a variety now called "Porcelana" due to its porcelain-like color. This cocoa bean, a genetically pure strain of the highly prized Criollo, is native to Venezuela and may have been grown there in the Pre-Columbian era.
Porcelana cocoa was called "Maracaibo" in colonial times, since it was primarily exported from that Venezuelan port community. Along with a few other Mexican and Colombian cocoas beans, Maracaibo cocoa was classified as one of the world's highest quality cocoas until the 1920s.
Today, many of these Mexican and Colombian cocoas have disappeared and have been replaced by more disease resistant hybrids. Maracaibo, or Porcelana cocoa is grown on small plantations in Venezuela. Amedei produces about 20,000 bars a year from this cocoa bean.
Packaging.
Amedei Porcelana is sold in individually numbered packages that have been called "the reference standard for the industry on how to package a chocolate bar."
Price.
A 1.8 oz bar sells in the United States for between US$12.95 and $18.99. The often-quoted price of this chocolate is $90 a pound. While Amedei Porcelana has often been called the world's most expensive chocolate, sources such as a 2006 article by "Forbes" magazine give examples of chocolates that sell for as much or more, although these examples refer more to chocolate in praline form or with the addition of pure gold to the packaging, while the assertion about Amedei Porcelana should be interpreted more as the cost of a pure chocolate bar or that of original cocoa beans, without taking into consideration any special packaging or manufacturing extra cost.
Golden Opulence Sundae and Golden Phoenix Cupcake.
Porcelana is included in the Golden Opulence Sundae, a $1,000 dessert sold at the Serendipity 3 restaurant in New York City and mentioned in the "Guinness Book of World Records". Porcelana is also used in making the most expensive cupcake, the Golden Phoenix, which is made by Bloomsbury's, a boutique cafe in Dubai.

Saimir Strati

Saimir Strati (born April 11, 1966) is an Albanian mosaic artist.
Strati was born in Tirana, Albania. He began his career doing restorations in Albania to several mosaics at the archeological sites of Byllis, Amantia and Apollonia. He is a member of the British Association of Modern Mosaic.
Artworks.
Saimir Strati is primarily an artist who works in mosaics. He has used materials including nails, toothpicks, corks, sea glass, eggshells, compact discs, coffee beans, porcelain and mirror glass among other materials. He is also a painter. The diversity of the artist's subjects, material and technique distinguish Saimir Strati as being traditional and contemporary with his approach on reviving the old technique and professionalism in antiquity and the mingling of daily/ industrial material.
Strati is heavily inspired by music, and in the mosaic series 'The Four Seasons' based on the Vivaldi concerto, each season is represented by a different musical instrument. This series was created over the course of more than five years. Another work on oil depicts traditional Albanian Polyphonic singers. 'The King' is a portrait of Elvis Presley measuring nearly 2 metres in height and uses over 400 CD's.
His work 'Sea Girl' is based on a legend from Vlora, his hometown. The story is about a young woman separated from her lover. She prays to become a fish to cross the sea to reunite with him. The artwork itself is made from sea glass which took the artist several years to collect.
'Peace' is a quintessential work of the artist, where the mirror fragments used in the mosaic reflects the message of our relation to peace.
Guinness World Record.
2006 - Leonardo da Vinci.
In 2006, Saimir Strati began what has seemingly become an annual tradition of setting a Guinness World Record. Using industrial nails, the artist re-created the self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci using nearly of nails over a surface. The technique resembles digital photography, in that each nail represents a pixel. The record was confirmed in Tirana by Guinness World Records on September 4, 2006, as the World's Largest Nail Mosaic.
2007 - Reinless Spirit.
The following summer another record attempt took place. On July 26, 2007, the artist began affixing toothpicks, a total of 1.5 million over a 4x2m surface, to create the image of a horse. The work was dedicated to Antonio Gaudi, and was confirmed on September 4, 2007 as the World's Largest Toothpick Mosaic. The largest toothpick mosaic was 8m2 (86.11 sq. feet) by Saimir Strati (Albania) and displayed at the Arbnori International Centre of Culture, Tirana, Albania on 4 September 2007. The artist used 1.5 million toothpicks and worked 40 days to achieve this record.
2008 - Mediterraneana.
In June 2008, Strati contacted what is now Ekphrasis Studio to collaborate and help manage his third record attempt. After several weeks of intense correspondence with various organizations in Barcelona that yielded little interest, it was decided to do the event in Tirana. On July 20, Ekphrasis Studio arranged a deal with Sheraton Tirana and on August 8 the artist began his third record attempt. The mosaic had a Mediterranean theme, and consisted of 229,764 corks over a surface of 12.94m x7.10m, or 91.87m2. The event took place over the course of 27 days at the Sheraton and was accompanied by an exhibition of both previous World Records as well as seven other artworks.
2009 - King of Pop.
In November 2009, for the Guinness World Record Day Saimir strati finished The largest Paint Brush Mosaic;
The mosaic was made by the artist all over Albania in every city .
and he finish it in the center of Tirana the capital of Albania.
He decided to do this Art work and also a Paint brush mosaic with gigantic sizes for the honor of
Michael Jackson after his death.This was the fourth Guinness world Record For Him And Albania
2010 - Artists Banknote.
For the Guinness World Record Day in November, Saimir Strati finished The Largest Screw Mosaic of a banknote and
dedicated the piece to artists all over the world. He chose the subject of a banknote as he felt that artists 
are poor and yet, for true artists, they are blind to it as the money is not so important. 
The mosaic has over 350000 screws in the relief.
Saimir Strati, finished this Art Piece in 10 Days.
2011 - One World,One Family,One Coffee.
In 31 days Saimir Strati created The Largest Coffee bean Mosaic in the World And he got his 6 Guinness World Record.
In this mosaic were 5 Characters, which Represented each a Continent.
The world was united by The Albanian Artists.
He used over One Million of coffee beans in this mosaic.
While in Tirana for a friendly match on August 20, players from the Liechtenstein national football team visited the exhibition. On August 26, Iceland Prime Minister Geir Haarde visited the exhibition with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha. On September 1, for the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the Albanian Royal Family, Prince Leka visited the exhibition. Albanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Lulzim Basha visited the exhibition on several occasions.
The mosaic was completed on September 4, 2008 and confirmed as the World's largest by Guinness Adjudicator Carlos Martinez.
Following the completion of the mosaic, players from the Swedish National Football Team visited the exhibition on September 6, and players from the Malta National Football Team visited it on September 10, while in Tirana for FIFA World Cup qualification matches.
Live performances.
Every world record attempt Saimir Strati has attempted has been a live performance. He has also done a large scale artistic performance at Dubai's annual "One World, One Family, One Festival" (Dubai Shopping Festival).
The World's Largest Nail Mosaic and the World's Largest Toothpick Mosaic were created in the International Cultural Centre of Tirana. The World's Largest Cork Mosaic was created at Sheraton Tirana.
His audience has included Royalty, National leaders, politicians, business leaders, professional athletes and the general public from around the world.
Recognition.
In November 2009, Strati was decorated with the Honour of The Nation by the President of Albania.

Death of Caylee Anthony

Caylee Marie Anthony (August 9, 2005 – 2008) was a two-year-old American girl who lived in Orlando, Florida with her mother, Casey Marie Anthony, and her maternal grandparents, George and Cindy Anthony. On July 15, 2008, she was reported missing to by Cindy, who said she had not seen Caylee for 31 days and that Casey's car smelled like a dead body had been inside it. Cindy said Casey had given varied explanations as to Caylee's whereabouts before finally telling her that she had not seen Caylee for weeks. Casey told detectives several falsehoods, including that the child had been kidnapped by a nanny on June 9, and that she had been trying to find her, too frightened to alert the authorities. She was charged with first-degree murder in October 2008 and pleaded not guilty.
On December 11, 2008, Caylee's skeletal remains were found with a blanket inside a trash bag in a wooded area near the family home. Investigative reports and trial testimony alternated between duct tape being found near the front of the skull and on the mouth of the skull. The medical examiner mentioned duct tape as one reason she ruled the death a homicide, but officially listed it as "death by undetermined means".
The trial lasted six weeks, from May to July 2011. The prosecution sought the death penalty and alleged Casey murdered her daughter to free herself from parental responsibilities by administering chloroform and applying duct tape. The defense team, led by Jose Baez, countered that the child had drowned accidentally in the family's swimming pool on June 16, 2008, and that George Anthony disposed of the body. The defense contended that Casey lied about this and other issues because of a dysfunctional upbringing, which they said included sexual abuse by her father. The defense did not present evidence as to how Caylee died, nor evidence that Casey was sexually abused as a child, but challenged every piece of the prosecution's evidence, calling much of it "fantasy forensics". Casey did not testify. On July 5, 2011, the jury found Casey not guilty of first degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child, but guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. With credit for time served, she was released on July 17, 2011. A Florida appeals court overturned two of the misdemeanor convictions on January 25, 2013.
The not guilty murder verdict was greeted with public outrage, and was both attacked and defended by media and legal commentators. Some complained that the jury misunderstood the meaning of reasonable doubt, while others said the prosecution relied too heavily on the defendant's allegedly poor moral character because they had been unable to show conclusively how the victim had died. "Time" magazine described the case as "the social media trial of the century".
Disappearance.
According to Casey Anthony's father, George Anthony, Casey left the family's home on June 16, 2008, taking her daughter Caylee (who was almost three) with her and did not return for 31 days. Casey's mother Cindy asked repeatedly during the month to see Caylee, but Casey claimed that she was too busy with a work assignment in Tampa, Florida. At other times, she said Caylee was with a nanny, who Casey identified by the name of Zenaida "Zanny" Fernandez-Gonzalez, or at theme parks or the beach. It was eventually determined that a woman named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez did in fact exist, but that she had never met Casey Anthony, Caylee Anthony, any member of the Anthony family, or any of Casey's friends.
On July 13, 2008, while doing yard work, Cindy and George Anthony found a notice from the post office for a certified letter affixed on their front door. George Anthony picked up the certified letter from the post office on July 15, 2008, and found that his daughter's car was in a tow yard. When George picked up the car, both he and the tow yard attendant noted a strong smell coming from the trunk. Both later stated that they believed the odor to be that of a decomposing body. When the trunk was opened, it contained a bag of trash, but no human remains.
Cindy Anthony reported Caylee missing that day, July 15, to the Orange County Sheriff's Office. During the same telephone call, Casey Anthony confirmed to the 911 operator that Caylee had been missing for 31 days. Sounding distraught, Cindy said: "There is something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car."
Case.
Investigation.
When Detective Yuri Melich, with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, began investigating the disappearance of Caylee Anthony, he found discrepancies in Casey's signed statement. When questioned, Casey said Caylee had been kidnapped by Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, who she also identified as "Zanny", Caylee's nanny. Although Casey had talked about her, Zanny had never been seen by Casey's family or friends, and in fact there was no nanny. Casey also told police that she was working at Universal Studios, a lie she had been telling her parents for years. Investigators brought Casey to Universal Studios on July 16, 2008, the day after Caylee was reported missing, and asked her to show them her office. Casey led police around for a while before admitting that she had been fired years before.
Casey Anthony was first arrested on July 16, 2008, and was charged the following day with giving false statements to law enforcement, child neglect, and obstruction of a criminal investigation. The judge denied bail, saying Casey had shown "woeful disregard for the welfare of her child". On August 21, 2008, after one month of incarceration, she was released from the Orange County jail after her $500,000 bond was posted by the nephew of California bail bondsman Leonard Padilla in hopes that she would cooperate and Caylee would be found.
On August 11, 12, and 13, 2008, meter reader Roy Kronk called police about a suspicious object found in a forested area near the Anthony residence. In the first instance, he was directed by the sheriff's office to call the tip line, which he did, receiving no return call. On the second instance, he again called the sheriff's office, eventually was met by two police officers and reported to them that he had seen what appeared to be a skull near a gray bag. On that occasion, the officer conducted a short search and stated he did not see anything. On December 11, 2008, Kronk again called the police. They searched and found the remains of a child in a trash bag. Investigative teams recovered duct tape which was hanging from Caylee's hair and some tissue left on her skull. Over the next four days, more bones were found in the wooded area near the spot where the remains initially had been discovered. On December 19, 2008, medical examiner Dr. Jan Garavaglia confirmed that the remains found were those of Caylee Anthony. The death was ruled a homicide and the cause of death listed as undetermined.
Arrests and charges.
Casey Anthony was offered a limited immunity deal on July 29, 2008, by prosecutors related to "the false statements given to law enforcement about locating her child", which was renewed on August 25, to expire August 28. She did not take it.
On September 5, 2008, she was released again on bail on all pending charges after being fitted with an electronic tracking device. Her $500,000 bond was posted by her parents, Cindy and George Anthony, who signed a promissory note for the bond.
On October 14, 2008, Casey Anthony was indicted by a grand jury on charges of first degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and four counts of providing false information to police. She was later arrested. Judge John Jordan ordered that she be held without bond. On October 21, 2008, the charges of child neglect were dropped against Casey, according to the State Attorney's Office because "the evidence proved that the child was deceased, the State sought an indictment on the legally appropriate charges." On October 28, Anthony was arraigned and pled not guilty to all charges.
On April 13, 2009, prosecutors announced that they planned to seek the death penalty in the case.
Trial.
Evidence.
Four hundred pieces of evidence were presented. A strand of hair was recovered from the trunk of Casey's car which was microscopically similar to hair taken from Caylee Anthony's hairbrush. The strand showed "root-banding," in which hair roots form a dark band after death, which was consistent with hair from a dead body.
The discoverer of the remains repeated the same basic story that he had told police. On Friday, October 24, 2008, a forensic report by Dr. Arpad Vass of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory judged that results from an air sampling procedure (called LIBS) performed in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car showed chemical compounds "consistent with a decompositional event" based on the presence of five key chemical compounds out of over 400 possible chemical compounds that Dr. Vass' research group considers typical of decomposition. Investigators stated that the trunk smelled strongly of human decomposition, but human decomposition was not specified on the laboratory scale. The process has not been affirmed by a Daubert Test in the courts. Dr. Vass' group also stated there was chloroform in the car trunk.
In October 2009, officials released 700 pages of documents related to the Anthony investigation, including records of Google searches of the terms "neck breaking" and "how to make chloroform" on a computer accessible to Casey Anthony, presented by the prosecutors as evidence of a crime.
According to detectives, crime-scene evidence included residue of a heart-shaped sticker found on duct tape over the mouth of Caylee's skull. However, the laboratory was not able to capture a heart-shape photographically after some duct tape was subjected to dye testing. A blanket found at the crime scene matched Caylee's bedding at her grandparents' home.
Among photos entered into evidence was one from the computer of Ricardo Morales, an ex-boyfriend of Casey Anthony, depicting a poster with the caption "Win her over with Chloroform".
Witness John Dennis Bradley's software, developed for computer investigations, was used by the prosecution to indicate that Casey Anthony had conducted extensive computer searches on the word "chloroform" 84 times, suggesting that Anthony had planned to commit murder. He later discovered that a flaw in the software misread the forensic data and that the word "chloroform" had been searched for only one time and the website in question offered information on the use of chloroform in the 19th century (see below).
Attorneys and jury.
The lead prosecutor in the case was Assistant State Attorney Linda Drane Burdick. Assistant State Attorneys Frank George and Jeff Ashton completed the prosecution team. Lead counsel for the defense was Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney. Attorneys J. Cheney Mason, Dorothy Clay Sims, and Ann Finnell served as co-counsel. During the trial, attorney Mark Lippman represented George and Cindy Anthony.
Selection of the jury began on May 9, 2011, at the Pinellas County Criminal Justice Center in Clearwater, Florida, because the case had been so widely reported in the Orlando area. Jurors were brought from Pinellas County to Orlando. Jury selection took longer than expected and ended on May 20, 2011, with twelve jurors and five alternates being sworn in. The panel consisted of nine women and eight men. The trial took six weeks, during which time the jury was sequestered to avoid influence from information available outside the courtroom.
Opening statements and witness testimony.
The trial began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding. In the opening statements, lead prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick described the story of the disappearance of Caylee Anthony day-by-day. The prosecution alleged an intentional murder and sought the death penalty against Casey Anthony. Prosecutors stated that Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious before putting duct tape over her nose and mouth to suffocate her, and left Caylee's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. They characterized Anthony as a party girl who killed her daughter to free herself from parental responsibility and enjoy her personal life.
The defense, led by Jose Baez, claimed in opening statements that Caylee drowned accidentally in the family's pool on June 16, 2008, and was found by George Anthony, who told Casey she would spend the rest of her life in jail for child neglect and then proceeded to cover up Caylee's death. Baez argued this is why Casey Anthony went on with her life and failed to report the incident for 31 days. He alleged that it was the habit of a lifetime for Casey to hide her pain and pretend nothing was wrong because she had been sexually abused by George Anthony since she was eight years old and her brother Lee also had made advances toward her. He admitted that Casey had lied about there being a nanny named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzales. Baez also questioned whether Roy Kronk, the meter reader who found the bones, actually had removed them from another location. And he alleged the police department botched the investigation because of their desire to feed a media frenzy about a child's murder rather than a more mundane drowning.
Prosecutors called George Anthony as their first witness, and, in a response to their question, he denied having sexually abused his daughter Casey. Anthony testified he did not smell anything resembling human decomposition in Casey's car when she visited him on June 24, but he did smell something similar to human decomposition when he picked the car up on July 15. Cindy Anthony testified that her comment to that Casey's car smelled "like someone died" was just a "figure of speech".
Baez asked an FBI analyst about the paternity test the FBI conducted to see if Lee was Caylee's father. She told the jury the test had come back negative.
Regarding a photo on the computer of Ricardo Morales, an ex-boyfriend of Casey Anthony, depicting a poster with the caption "Win her over with Chloroform," Morales said that the photo was on his Myspace page and that he had never discussed chloroform with Anthony or searched for chloroform on her computer.
The prosecution called John Dennis Bradley, a former Canadian law enforcement officer who develops software for computer investigations, to analyze a data file from a desktop taken from the Anthony home. Bradley said he was able to use a program to recover deleted searches from March 17 and March 21, 2008, and that someone searched the website Sci-spot.com for "chloroform" 84 times. Bradley expressed his belief that "some of these items might have been bookmarked". Under cross-examination by the defense, Bradley agreed there were two individual accounts on the desktop and that there was no way to know who actually performed the searches.
K9 handler Jason Forgey testified that Gerus, a German Shepherd cadaver dog certified in 2005, indicated a high alert of human decomposition in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car, saying the police dog has had real-world searches numbering "over three thousand by now". During cross-examination, Baez argued that the dog's search records were "hearsay". Sgt. Kristin Brewer also testified that her K9 partner, Bones, signaled decomposition in the backyard during a search in July 2008. However, neither K9 partner was able to detect decomposition during a second visit to the Anthony home. Brewer explained that this was because whatever had been in the yard was either moved or the odor dissipated.
The prosecution called to the stand the chief medical examiner Dr. Jan Garavaglia, who testified that she determined Caylee's manner of death to be homicide, but listed it as "death by undetermined means". Garavaglia took into account the physical evidence present on the remains she examined, as well as all the available information on the way they were found and what she had been told by the authorities, before arriving at her determination. "We know by our observations that it's a red flag when a child has not been reported to authorities with injury, there's foul play," Garavaglia said. " ... There is no child that should have duct tape on lower part of its face when it dies." Additionally, Garavaglia addressed the chloroform evidence found by investigators inside the trunk of Casey Anthony's car, testifying that even a small amount of chloroform would be sufficient to cause the death of a child.
University of Florida professor and human identification laboratory director Michael Warren was brought on by the prosecution to present a computer animation of the way duct tape could have been used in the death of the child, which the defense objected to hearing. Judge Perry, after a short recess to review, ruled that the video could be shown to the jury. The animation featured a picture of Caylee Anthony taken alongside Casey Anthony, superimposed with an image of Caylee's decomposed skull, and another with a strip of duct tape that was recovered with her remains. The images were slowly brought together showing that the duct tape could have covered her nose and mouth. Baez stated, "This disgusting superimposition is nothing more than a fantasy ...They're throwing things against the wall and seeing if it sticks." Jurors were seen taking notes of the imagery, and Warren testified that it was his opinion that the duct tape found with Caylee's skull was placed there before her body began decomposing.
FBI latent-print examiner Elizabeth Fontaine testified that adhesive in the shape of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of Caylee's remains during ultraviolet testing. Fontaine examined three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Though Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, "When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination." During the defense's cross-examination, Fontaine explained that when she examined the sticker evidence a second time, after subjecting the tape to dye testing, "It was no longer visible." She said that other FBI agents had tested the duct tape in the interim.
The defense called two government witnesses who countered prosecution witness testimony about the duct tape. The chief investigator for the medical examiner stated that the original placement of the duct tape was unclear and it could have shifted positions as he collected the remains. Cindy Anthony testified that their family buried their pets in blankets and plastic bags, using duct tape to seal the opening. Additionally, an FBI forensic document examiner found no evidence of a sticker or sticker residue on the duct tape found near the child's remains.
The defense called forensic pathologist Dr. Werner Spitz, who performed a second autopsy on Caylee after Garavagli and challenged Garavaglia's autopsy report. He called her autopsy "shoddy," saying it was a failure that Caylee's skull was not opened during her examination. "You need to examine the whole body in an autopsy," he said. Spitz stated that he was not allowed to attend Garavaglia's initial autopsy on Caylee's remains, and that, from his own follow-up autopsy, he was not comfortable ruling the child's death a homicide. He said he could not determine what Caylee Anthony's manner of death was, but said that there was no indication to him that she was murdered. Additionally, Spitz testified that he believed the duct tape found on Caylee's skull was placed there after the body decomposed, opining that if tape was placed on the skin, there should have been DNA left on it, and suggested that someone may have staged some of the crime scene photos. "The person who took this picture, the person who prepared this, put the hair there," stated Spitz. When asked by Ashton during cross-examination, "So your testimony is the medical examiner's personnel took the hair that wasn't on the skull, placed it there?", Spitz answered, "It wouldn't be the first time, sir. I can tell you some horror stories about that."
On June 21, Bradley discovered that a flaw in his software misread the forensic data and that the word "chloroform" had been searched for only one time and the website in question offered information on the use of chloroform in the 19th century. On June 23, Baez called Cindy Anthony to the stand, who told jurors she had been the one who performed the "chloroform" search on the family computer in March 2008. The prosecution alleged that only Casey Anthony could have conducted this search and the others because she was the only one home at the time. When asked by prosecutors how she could have made the Internet searches when employment records show she was at work, Cindy Anthony said despite what her work time sheet indicates, she was at home during these time periods because she left from work early during the days in question. Bradley alerted prosecutor Linda Burdick and Sgt. Kevin Stenger of the Sheriff's Office the weekend of June 25 about the discrepancy in his software, and volunteered to fly to Orlando at his own expense to show them. On the same day, the judge temporarily halted proceedings when the defense filed a motion to determine if Anthony was competent to proceed with trial. The motion states the defense received a privileged communication from their client which caused them to believe "...Ms. Anthony is not competent to aid and assist in her own defense". The trial resumed on June 27 when the judge announced that the results of the psychological evaluations showed Anthony was competent to proceed. Later, in testimony about air samples, Dr. Ken Furton, a professor of chemistry at Florida International University, stated that there is no consensus in the field on what chemicals are typical of human decomposition. Judge Perry ruled that the jury would not get to smell air samples taken from the trunk.
The prosecution stated they discussed Bradley's software discrepancy with Baez on June 27, and he raised the issue in court testimony. Baez also asked Judge Perry to instruct the jury about this search information, but prosecutors disputed this and it was not done. Also on June 27, the defense called two private investigators who, in November 2008, had searched the area where the body was later found. The search was videotaped, but nothing was found. On June 28, the defense called a Texas EquuSearch team leader who did two searches of the area and found no body. The defense then called Roy Kronk, who recounted the same basic story he told police about his discovery of Caylee Anthony's remains in December 2008. He acknowledged receiving $5,000 after the remains were identified, but denied that he told his son that finding the body would make him rich and famous. The next day, his son testified he had made such statements.
On June 30, the defense called Krystal Holloway, a volunteer in the search for Caylee, who stated that she had an affair with George Anthony, he had been to her home and that he had texted her, "Just thinking about you. I need you in my life." She told the defense that George Anthony had told her that Caylee's death was "an accident that snowballed out of control." Under cross-examination by prosecutors, they pointed to her sworn police statement in which she says George Anthony believes it was an accident, rather than knowing that it was. In her initial report, Holloway reported George Anthony saying, "I really believe that it was an accident that just went wrong and (Casey Anthony) tried to cover it up." She said he had not told her he was present when the alleged accident occurred. During redirect examination, Baez asked Holloway if Anthony told her Caylee was dead while stating publicly she was missing, and she said yes.
In his earlier testimony, George Anthony denied the affair with Holloway and said he visited her only because she was ill. He said he sent the text message because he needed everyone who had helped in his life. After Holloway's testimony, Judge Perry told jurors that it could be used to impeach George Anthony's credibility, but that it was not proof of how Caylee died and/or evidence of Casey Anthony's guilt or innocence.
The prosecution rested its case on June 15, after calling 59 witnesses for 70 different testimonies. The defense rested its case on June 30, after calling 47 witnesses for 63 different testimonies. Casey Anthony did not testify.
On June 30 and July 1, the prosecutor presented rebuttal arguments, beginning by showing the jury photographs of Caylee's clothes and George's suicide note. It called two representatives of Cindy Anthony's former employer who explained why their computer login system shows Cindy was at work the afternoon she said she went home early and searched her computer for information about chloroform. A police computer analyst testified someone had purposely searched online for "neck + breaking." Another analyst testified she did not find evidence that Cindy Anthony had searched certain terms she claimed to have searched. Anthropology professor Dr. Michael Warren from the University of Florida was recalled to rebut a defense witness on the need to open a skull during an autopsy. The lead detective stated that there were no phone calls between Cindy and George Anthony during the week of June 16, 2008. However, he told the defense he did not know that George had a second cell phone.
Closing arguments.
Closing arguments were heard July 3 and July 4. Jeff Ashton, for the prosecution, told the jury, "When you have a child, that child becomes your life. This case is about the clash between that responsibility, and the expectations that go with it, and the life that Casey Anthony wanted to have." He outlined the state's case against Casey Anthony, touching on her many lies to her parents and others, the smell in her car's trunk—identified by several witnesses, including her own father, as the odor from human decomposition—and the items found with Caylee's skeletal remains in December 2008. He emphasized how Anthony "maintains her lies until they absolutely cannot be maintained any more" and then replaces with another lie, using "Zanny the Nanny" as an example. Anthony repeatedly told police that Caylee was with the nanny that she specifically identifies as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. Police, however, were never able to find the nanny. Authorities did find a woman named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, but she denied ever meeting the Anthonys.
Ashton reintroduced the items found with Caylee's remains, including a Winnie the Pooh blanket that matched the bedding at her grandparents' home, one of a set of laundry bags with the twin bag found at the Anthony home, and duct tape he said was a relatively rare brand. "That bag is Caylee's coffin", Ashton said, holding up a photograph of the laundry bag, as Casey Anthony reacted with emotion. He further criticized the defense's theory that Caylee drowned in the Anthony pool and that Casey and George Anthony panicked upon finding the child's body and covered up her death. He advised jurors to use their common sense when deciding on a verdict. "No one makes an accident look like murder", he said.
Before closing arguments, Judge Perry ruled that the defense could argue that a drowning occurred due to reasonable conclusions aided by witness testimony, but that arguing sexual abuse was not allowed since there was nothing to support the claim that George Anthony sexually abused Casey Anthony. Baez contended that there were holes in the prosecution's forensic evidence, saying it was based on a "fantasy". He told the jury that the prosecution wanted them to see stains and insects that did not really exist, that they had not proven that the stains in Anthony's car trunk were caused by Caylee's decomposing body, rather than from a trash bag found there. He added that the prosecutors tried to make his client look like a promiscuous liar because their evidence was weak. He said the drowning is "the only explanation that makes sense" and showed jurors a photograph of Caylee opening the home's sliding glass door by herself. He stressed that there were no child safety locks in the home and that both of Casey Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, testified that Caylee could get out of the house easily. Although Cindy Anthony testified that Caylee could not put the ladder on the side of the pool and climb up, Baez alleged that Cindy Anthony may have left the ladder up the night before. "She didn't admit to doing so in testimony", he said, "but how much guilt would she have knowing it was her that left the ladder up that day?"
Defense attorney Jose Baez told jurors his biggest fear was that they would base their verdict on emotions, not evidence. "The strategy behind that is, if you hate her, if you think she's a lying, no-good slut, then you'll start to look at this evidence in a different light", he said. "I told you at the very beginning of this case that this was an accident that snowballed out of control... What made it unique is not what happened, but who it happened to." He explained Casey Anthony's behavior as being the result of her dysfunctional family situation. At one point as Baez spoke, Ashton could be seen smiling or chuckling behind his hand. This prompted Baez to refer to him as "this laughing guy right here". The judge called a sidebar conference, then a recess. When court resumed, he chastised both sides, saying both Ashton and Baez had violated his order that neither side should make disparaging remarks about opposing counsel. After both attorneys apologized, the judge accepted the apologies but warned that a recurrence would have the offending attorney excluded from the courtroom.
Defense attorney Cheney Mason then followed with an additional closing argument. Addressing the jury to discuss the charges against Casey Anthony. "The burden rests on the shoulders of my colleagues at the state attorney's office", Mason said, referring to proving that Casey Anthony committed a crime. Mason said that the jurors are required, whether they like it or not, to find the defendant not guilty if the state did not adequately prove its case against Casey Anthony. Mason emphasized that the burden of proof is on the state, and that Casey Anthony's decision not to testify is not an implication of guilt.
Lead prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick in the prosecution rebuttal told the jurors that she and her colleagues backed up every claim they made in their opening statement six weeks ago, and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims. "My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all the rhetoric of the case," she said, insisting that she would never ask the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence. "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," she stated. "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a "decoy" put there to keep people from getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot. "Whose life was better without Caylee?" she asked, stressing how George and Cindy Anthony were wondering where their daughter and granddaughter were in June and July 2008, the same time Casey was staying at her boyfriend's apartment while Caylee's body was decomposing in the woods. "That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left on the side of the road dead." Burdick then showed the jury a split-screen with a photo of Casey partying at a night club on one side and a close-up of the "Bella Vita" (meaning "Beautiful Life") tattoo that she got weeks after Caylee died on the other.
The jury began deliberations on July 4. On July 5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, they were about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so. One legal analyst stated that if the jury had found Anthony guilty before receiving the exculpatory evidence, the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial.
Verdict and sentence.
On July 5, 2011, the jury found Casey Anthony not guilty of counts one through three regarding first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and aggravated child abuse, while finding her guilty on counts four through seven for providing false information to law enforcement:
On July 7, 2011, sentencing arguments were heard. The defense asked for the sentencing to be based on one count of lying on the grounds that the offenses occurred as part of a single interview with police dealing with the same matter, the disappearance of her daughter, as one continuous lie. The defense also argued for concurrent sentences, that is for all four counts to become one count and the sentence to run together as one. The judge disagreed with defense arguments, finding that Anthony's statements consisted of "four distinct, separate lies" ordered the sentences be served consecutively, noting that "Law enforcement expended a great deal of time, energy and manpower looking for Caylee Marie Anthony. This search went on from July through December, over several months, trying to find Caylee Marie Anthony." Judge Perry sentenced Anthony to one year in the county jail and $1,000 in fines for each of the four counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer, the maximum penalty prescribed by law. She received 1043 days credit for time served plus additional credit for good behavior, resulting in her release on July 17, 2011. Anthony filed a notice of appeal on July 15, 2011.
In September 2011, Perry, complying with a Florida statute requiring judges to assess investigative and prosecution costs if requested by a state agency, ruled that Casey Anthony must pay $217,000 to the state of Florida. He ruled she had to pay those costs directly related to lying to law enforcement about the death of Caylee, including search costs only up to September 30, 2008, when the Sheriff's Office stopped investigating a missing-child case. In earlier arguments Attorney Cheney Mason had called the prosecutors' attempts to exact the larger sum "sour grapes" because the prosecution lost its case. He told reporters that Anthony is indigent.
In January 2013, a Florida appeals court reduced her convictions from four to two counts. Her attorney had argued that her false statements constituted a single offense, however the appeals court noted she gave false information during two separate police interviews several hours apart.
Media coverage.
Initial coverage.
The case attracted a significant amount of national media attention, and was regularly the main topic of many TV talk shows, including those hosted by Greta Van Susteren, Nancy Grace, Geraldo Rivera, and others. It has been featured on Fox's "America's Most Wanted", NBC's "Dateline", and ABC's "20/20". Nancy Grace referred to Casey Anthony as the "tot mom" and urged the public to let "the professionals, the psychics and police" do their jobs.
Casey Anthony's parents, Cindy and George, appeared on "The Today Show" on October 22, 2008. They maintained their belief that Caylee was alive and would be found. Larry Garrison, president of SilverCreek Entertainment, was their spokesman until he resigned in November 2008, citing that he was leaving due to "the Anthony family's erratic behavior".
More than 6,000 pages of evidence released by the Orange County Sheriff's Department, including hundreds of instant messages between Casey and her ex-boyfriend Tony Rusciano, were the subject of increased scrutiny by the media for clues and possible motives in the homicide. 
Outside the Anthony home, WESH TV 2 reported that protesters repeatedly shouted "baby killer" and that George Anthony was physically attacked. George Anthony was reported missing on January 22, 2009, after he failed to show up for a meeting with his lawyer, Brad Conway. George was found in a Daytona Beach hotel the next day after sending messages to family members threatening suicide. He was taken to Halifax Hospital for psychiatric evaluation and later released.
Trial coverage.
The trial was commonly compared to the O. J. Simpson murder case, both for its widespread media attention and initial shock at the not-guilty verdict. At the start of the trial, dozens of people raced to the Orange County Courthouse, hoping to secure one of 50 seats open to the public at the murder trial. Because the case received such thorough media attention in Orlando, jurors were brought in from Pinellas County, Florida, and sequestered for the entire trial. The case became a "macabre tourist attraction", as people camped outside for seats in the courtroom, where scuffles also broke out among those wanting seats inside. The "New York Post" described the trial as going "from being a newsworthy case to one of the biggest ratings draws in recent memory", and "Time" magazine dubbed it "the social media trial of the century". Cable news channels and network news programs became intent upon covering the case as extensively as they could. Scot Safon, executive vice president of HLN, said it was "not about policy" but rather the "very, very strong human dimension" of the case that drove the network to cover it. The audience for HLN's "Nancy Grace" rose more than 150 percent, and other news channels deciding to focus on the trial saw their ratings double and triple. HLN achieved its most watched hour in network history (4.575 million) and peaked at 5.205 million when the verdict was read. According to "The Christian Post", the O. J. Simpson case had a 91 percent television viewing audience, with 142 million people listening by radio and watching television as the verdict was delivered. "The Simpson case was the longest trial ever held in California, costing more than $20 million to fight and defend, running up 50,000 pages of trial transcript in the process." The Casey Anthony trial was expected to "far exceed" these numbers.
Opinions varied on what made the public thoroughly invested in the trial. Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and "unremarkable" family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch. Frank Farley of CNN described the circumstantial evidence as "all over the map" and that combined with "the apparent lying, significant contradictions and flip-flops of testimony, and questionable or bizarre theories of human behavior, it is little wonder that this nation glued to the tube". He said it was a trial that was both a psychologist's dream and nightmare, and believes that much of the public's fascination [had to do with the uncertainty of a motive for the crime. Psychologist Dr. Karyl McBride discussed how some mothers stray away from "the saintly archetype" expected of mothers. "We want so badly to hang onto the belief system that mothers don't harm children," she stated. "It's fascinating that the defense in the Anthony case found a way to blame the father. While we don't know what is true and maybe never will, it is worth taking a look at the narcissistic family when maternal narcissism rules the roost. Casey Anthony is a beautiful white woman and the fact that the case includes such things as sex, lies, and videotapes makes it irresistible."
When the not-guilty verdict was rendered, there was significant outcry among the general public and media that the jury made the wrong decision. Outside the courthouse, many in the crowd of 500 reacted with anger, chanting their disapproval and waving protest signs. People took to Facebook and Twitter, as well as other social media outlets, to express their outrage. Traffic to news sites surged from about two million page views a minute to 3.3 million, with most of the visits coming from the United States. Mashable reported that between 2 pm and 3 pm, one million viewers were watching CNN.com/live, 30 times higher than the previous month's average. Twitter's trending topics in the United States were mostly about the subjects related to the case, and Newser reported that posts on Facebook were coming in "too fast for all Facebook to even count them, meaning at least 10 per second". Some people referred to the verdict as "O.J. Number 2", and various media personalities and celebrities expressed outrage via Twitter. News anchor Julie Chen became visibly upset while reading the not-guilty verdict on "The Talk" and had to be assisted by her fellow co-hosts, who also expressed their dismay.
Others, such as Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel, felt the verdict was fair because the prosecution did not have enough evidence to establish guilt or meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Hannity said that the verdict was legally correct, and that all of the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was either impeached or contradicted by the defense. John Cloud of "Time" magazine echoed these sentiments, saying the jury made the right call: "Anthony got off because the prosecution couldn't answer questions," Cloud stated. "Because the prosecutors had so little physical evidence, they built their case on Anthony's (nearly imperceptible) moral character. The prosecutors seemed to think that if jurors saw what a fantastic liar Anthony was, they would understand that she could also be a murderer."
Disagreement with the verdict was heavily debated by the media, lawyers and psychologists, who put forth several theories for public dissatisfaction with the decision, ranging from wanting justice for Caylee, to the circumstantial evidence having been strong enough, to some blaming the media. UCLA forensic psychiatrist Dr. Carole Lieberman, said, "The main reason that people are reacting so strongly is that the media convicted Casey before the jury decided on the verdict. The public has been whipped up into this frenzy wanting revenge for this poor little adorable child. And because of the desire for revenge, they've been whipped up into a lynch mob." She added, "Nobody likes a liar, and Anthony was a habitual liar. And nobody liked the fact that she was partying after Caylee's death. Casey obviously has a lot of psychological problems. Whether she murdered her daughter or not is another thing."
There was a gender gap in perceptions to the case. According to a "USA Today"/Gallup Poll of 1,010 respondents, about two-thirds of Americans (64 percent) believed Casey Anthony "definitely" or "probably" murdered her daughter; however, women were much more likely than men to believe the murder charges against Anthony and to be upset by the not-guilty verdict. The poll reported that women were more than twice as likely as men, 28 percent versus 11 percent, to think Anthony "definitely" committed murder. Twenty-seven percent of women said they were angry about the verdict, compared with nine percent of men. On the day Casey Anthony was sentenced for lying to investigators in the death of her daughter, supporters and protesters gathered outside the Orange County Courthouse, with one man who displayed a sign asking Anthony to marry him. Two men who drove overnight from West Virginia held signs that said, "We love and support you Casey Anthony," and "Nancy Grace, stop trying to ruin innocent lives. The jury has spoken. P.S. Our legal system still works!" The gender gap has partly been explained by "the maternal instinct". The idea of a mother murdering her own child is a threat to the ideal of motherhood. For example, the trial was compared to the 1960s Alice Crimmins trial, who was accused of murdering her two small children.
Explanations other than, or emphasizing, the prosecution's lack of forensic evidence were given for the jury's decision. A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Anthony to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented. The CSI effect was also extensively argued—that society now lives "in a 'CSI age' where everyone expects fingerprints and DNA, and we are sending a message that old-fashioned circumstantial evidence is not sufficient". Likewise, commentators such as O. J. Simpson case prosecutor Marcia Clark believe that the jury interpreted "reasonable doubt" too narrowly. Clark said instruction on reasonable doubt is "the hardest, most elusive" instruction of all. "And I think it's where even the most fair-minded jurors can get derailed," she said, opining the confusion between "reasonable doubt" and "a reason to doubt." "In Scotland, they have three verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and not proven. It's one way of showing that even if the jury didn't believe the evidence amounted to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it didn't find the defendant innocent either. There's a difference."
Aftermath.
Defense, prosecution, and jury.
Following the criminal trial, Cheney Mason, one of Casey Anthony's defense attorneys, blamed the media for the passionate hatred directed toward his client. He described it as a "media assassination" of Anthony before and during the trial, saying, "I hope that this is a lesson to those of you who have indulged in media assassination for three years, bias, and prejudice, and incompetent talking heads saying what would be and how to be." Mason added: "I can tell you that my colleagues from coast to coast and border to border have condemned this whole process of lawyers getting on television and talking about cases that they don't know a damn thing about, and don't have the experience to back up their words or the law to do it. Now you have learned a lesson."
Mason's response was viewed as especially critical of Nancy Grace, whose news program is cited as having "almost single-handedly inflated the Anthony case from a routine local murder into a national obsession". Grace said that she did not understand why Mason would care what pundits are saying, and that she imagines she has tried and covered as many cases as Mason. She criticized the defense attorneys for delivering media criticism before mentioning Caylee's name in their post-verdict news conference, and said she disagrees with the verdict. At a meeting of local professionals, named the Tiger Bay Club of Tampa, Mason told the media and those in attendance that he was surprised by the not-guilty verdict.
State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said, "We're disappointed in the verdict today because we know the facts and we've put in absolutely every piece of evidence that existed. This is a dry-bones case. Very, very difficult to prove. The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage." Jose Baez said, "While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case. Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force has been for the last three years has been always to make sure that there has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee. It's that simple." He added, "And today our system of justice has not dishonored her memory by a false conviction." Sharing Baez's sentiments, former Casey Anthony defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden said that the state was trying to "find Elvis on toast". She believes the jury reached the right verdict. "We should embrace their verdict", she stated.
On July 6, 2011, Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton gave his first interview about the case on "The View". Ashton said of the verdict, "Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted. But from the perspective of what we do, this was a fantastic case." He disagrees with those who state the prosecution overcharged the case, saying, "The facts that we had... this was first-degree murder. I think it all came down to the evidence. I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death." Ashton additionally explained that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, "then so be it". He said he accepts the jury's decision and that it has not taken away his faith in the justice system. "You can't believe in the rule of law and not accept that sometimes it doesn't go the way you think it should", stated Ashton, and explained that he understands why the case "struck such a nerve" with the public. "I think when people see someone that they believe has so gone away from mother's love for her child, it just outrages them." Ashton also made appearances on several other talk shows in the days following, and complimented Jose Baez on his cross-examinations and as having "the potential to be a great attorney".
After the trial ended, the twelve jurors did not initially want to discuss the verdict with the media. 51-year-old Russell Huekler, an alternate juror who stepped forward the day of the verdict, said, "The prosecution didn't provide the evidence that was there for any of the charges from first-degree murder down to second-degree murder to the child abuse to even the manslaughter . It just wasn't there."
The next day, juror number three—Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student—told ABC News, "I did not say she was innocent" and "I just said there was not enough evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot determine what the punishment should be." She added "I'm not saying that I believe the defense," but that "it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B" via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. She also believed George Anthony was "dishonest." She said the jury "was sick to our stomachs to get that verdict" and that the decision process overwhelmed them to the point where they did not want to talk to reporters afterwards. Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the "St. Petersburg Times" that "everybody agreed if we were going fully on feelings and emotions, was done". He stated that a lack of evidence was the reason for the not guilty verdict: "I just swear to God ... I wish we had more evidence to put her away. I truly do ... But it wasn't there." He also said that Anthony was "not a good person in my opinion". Juror number six, identified by WTSP as Brian Berling, told gossip website TMZ.com that he was willing to be interviewed "so long as the opportunities are paid".
In an anonymous interview, the jury foreman stated, "When I had to sign off on the verdict, the sheet that was given to me—there was just a feeling of disgust that came over me knowing that my signature and Anthony's signature were going to be on the same sheet," but that "there was a suspicion of Anthony" that played a part in their deliberations. The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony "had a very selective memory" which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. "That a mother would want to do something like that to her child just because she wanted to go out and party," he said. "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10-2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.
Perry announced at sentencing on July 7 that he would withhold the jurors' names for several months because of concern that "Some people would like to take something out on them." He released jurors' names on October 25, 2011. On May 6, 2013, he stated that he believed there was sufficient evidence to convict Casey Anthony, even though most of the evidence was circumstantial, and that he was shocked by the not-guilty verdict.
Anthony family.
Mark Lippman, the attorney for George and Cindy Anthony, told ABC News that the family received death threats after the "Not Guilty" verdict was rendered. In response to the verdict, a statement was released by Lippman on behalf of the Anthony family (George, Cindy and Lee Anthony):
While the family may never know what has happened to Caylee Marie Anthony, they now have closure for this chapter of their life. They will now begin the long process of rebuilding their lives. Despite the baseless defense chosen by Casey Anthony, the family believes that the Jury made a fair decision based on the evidence presented, the testimony presented, the scientific information presented and the rules that were given to them by the Honorable Judge Perry to guide them. The family hopes that they will be given the time by the media to reflect on this verdict and decide the best way to move forward privately.
It was alleged in press reports that Cindy Anthony had perjured herself when telling jurors she—not Casey Anthony—was the one who used her family computer to search the Internet for "chloroform". The state attorney's office said she would not be charged.
On July 6, 2011, Anthony's jailhouse letters were released to the general public. They were originally released (though not to public) in April 2010 by prosecutors preparing for the Anthony trial. In more than 250 handwritten pages, Anthony discusses her life in jail, what she misses, and her plans for the future if freed. On July 8, 2011, Cindy Anthony had scheduled a visit to meet with Casey at 7 pm, but the visit was denied. "This morning under policy, Casey was told of the visit and she has declined the visit so it will not occur", said jail spokesman Allen Moore. Moore also said that Cindy would be notified of her daughter's decision. Mark Lippman told Reuters during the trial that Casey had cut off communication with her parents. It was later announced that George and Cindy Anthony would be appearing on "Dr. Phil" in September 2011 to tell their story.
Casey Anthony left for an undisclosed location not long after the verdict. However, on August 12, she was ordered to return to Florida to serve a year's supervised probation for an unrelated check-fraud conviction. When she pleaded guilty to that charge in January 2010, the judge in that case intended for Anthony to serve her probation after proceedings in the murder case concluded, but an error in the sentencing documents allowed her to serve her probation while awaiting trial. Anthony returned to Florida on August 25 and is serving out her probation in an undisclosed location. Due to numerous threats against her life, the Department of Corrections did not enter her information into the state parolee database. In August 2011, George and Cindy Anthony issued a statement that Casey would not be living at their home when she returned to Florida to serve her probation. According to "Huffington Post", she is reportedly working with her probation officer to take online college classes in an unspecified field, while protected by her security, at an undisclosed educational institution.
In August 2011, the Florida Department of Children and Families released a report based on a three-year investigation into the disappearance and death of Caylee Anthony. An agency spokesperson stated "It is the conclusion of the that [Casey Anthony failed to protect her child from harm either through her actions or lack of actions, which tragically resulted in the child's untimely death."
Casey Anthony filed bankruptcy with the Middle District of Florida Bankruptcy Court on January 27, 2013. Her estimated liabilities were between $500,000 and $1 million.
Civil suits.
In September 2008, Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey Anthony for defamation. During the investigation, Anthony told investigators that she left 2½-year-old Caylee with a babysitter named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez—also known as "Zanny"—on June 16 at the stairs of a specific apartment in the Sawgrass apartment complex located in Orlando. Fernandez-Gonzalez, who was listed on apartment records as having visited apartments on that date, was questioned by police, but stated she did not know Casey or Caylee Anthony. Her defamation suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Casey willfully damaged her reputation. Fernandez-Gonzalez has told reporters that she lost her job, was evicted from her house, and received death threats against herself and her children as a result of Anthony's lies. Fernandez-Gonzalez' lawyer, John Morgan, said he wants to interrogate Anthony about Caylee's death because it is "the essence" of the defamation suit. On October 8, 2011, Morgan deposed Anthony via a video conference. As expected, Anthony exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and answered only a couple of factual questions. Morgan felt that was improper, but legal experts think that Anthony is well within her rights to plead the Fifth until her appeals of the convictions for lying to officers are exhausted. Fernandez-Gonzalez' defamation suit is expected to go to trial in January 2013. Fernandez-Gonzalez' attorneys sought and received permission to obtain Anthony's address (though it was kept sealed from the public) so they could subpoena her to testify, even if she only took the stand long enough to plead the Fifth. However, Fernandez-Gonzalez is willing to drop the suit if Anthony apologizes to her and compensates her for pain and suffering.
In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a non-profit group which assisted in the search for Caylee from July to December 2008 when she was believed to be missing, sued Anthony for fraud and unjust enrichment. TES estimates that it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead. TES founder and director Tim Miller estimates that the abortive search for Caylee expended 40% of the group's yearly resources which could have been spent looking for other missing children. It only learned that Anthony knew all along that Caylee was dead when the trial began.
"Caylee's Law".
Since the end of the trial, various movements have arisen for the creation of a new law, called "Caylee's Law", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child. One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained over 1.2 million electronic signatures. In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states—Florida, Oklahoma, New York, and West Virginia—have begun drafting versions of "Caylee's Law". The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of 12. The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger. The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being "reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive." One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours. Additionally innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police.
Memorials and tribute songs.
Different artists have written songs in Caylee's memory, often titled "Caylee's Song". Jon Whynock performed his own version at her memorial service in February 2009, and Sheffield songwriter Earl "Peanutt" Montgomery, an Alabama Music Hall of Fame member known for writing hits for country artist George Jones, penned a "Caylee's Song" soon after hearing the verdict. "Me and my wife talked about it, and I decided to do it", said Montgomery. He sent an MP3 of "Caylee" to CNN and the cable news show "Nancy Grace", as well as to various radio stations and Internet radio stations. Rascal Flatts' Gary LeVox collaborated with country comedian and radio host Cledus T. Judd and songwriter Jimmy Yeary to write a song titled "She's Going Places" in Caylee's memory, which would be performed by singer Shane Hines. On July 8, 2011, Grace played it for her audience.
Later information.
In November 2012, WKMG-TV television in Orlando reported that police never investigated Firefox browser evidence on Casey Anthony's computer the day of Caylee's death; they only looked at Internet Explorer evidence. The browser history showed that someone at the Anthony household used Firefox to do a Google search for "foolproof suffocation" and then clicked on an article about committing suicide by taking poison and putting a plastic bag over one's head. The browser then recorded activity on MySpace, a site used by Casey Anthony but not George Anthony. The station learned about this information from Casey Anthony's attorney Jose Baez who mentioned it in his book on the case, speculating that George had contemplated suicide after Caylee's death. He conceded to reporters that the records are open to interpretation.

She grew up in Melbourne's inner east in a cottage called 'Byron'. In 2006, she won the State Legacy Public Speaking Competition. She claims she "Kind of stumbled across writing". She says she was 13 years old and on school holidays when she decided to become a recluse and started writing her first book for young adults, entitled The Shadow Thief. She did some research into Australian publishing houses, making sure she followed all the submission guidelines exactly, and then sent her 45,000 word manuscript to HarperCollins. She has said that it took HarperCollins about twenty-four weeks to get back to her asking to publish her book. Since then, Alexandra has written five more novels and has been featured in Fairfax publications commenting about substance abuse and sexual interests.

Cross River languages

The Cross River or Delta–Cross languages are a branch of the Benue–Congo language family in south-easternmost Nigeria posited by Joseph Greenberg. It is one of the few of his branches of Niger–Congo that has withstood the test of time. 
The original name was "Cross River." The Bendi languages were soon seen to be aberrant, and the other branches united under the term "Delta–Cross." However, the inclusion of Bendi is doubtful, and it has been tentatively reassigned to the Southern Bantoid family, making the terms "Cross River" and "Delta–Cross" synonymous.

Location and features.
The suburbs of , , and are situated on its slopes.
Mount Rogers has several significant rocky outcrops around the area which are predominately made up of dacite, indicating the area's volcanic past. Small boulders are also common and the soil is generally rocky and thin. The area contain approximately 50 two hundred year old eucalypts. The stumps of even larger older trees indicate that, prior to European settlement, the landscape would have been an open grassy woodland. Many new trees and shrubs were planted in the early 1970s as the suburbs' houses were built around the rather treeless hill.
Mount Rogers has a popular walking track, approximately 2.5km in length, around its perimeter which offers beautiful views of Lake Ginninderra, the Brindabellas, and Hall. Regular walkers and other locals care about this 64 hectare (approx.) piece of land and its bird, reptile, plant and mammal species, and this interest has promoted community spirit and monthly working bees. The area has a Landcare group, Mt Rogers Landcare, which has a blog where the groups' coordinator's newsletters are posted periodically. 
Superb Parrots and Tawny Frogmouths have been regular (bird) visitors to Mt Rogers in recent years, as recorded on the blog and its pages.

Darkest Hour (The Mediator)

Darkest Hour is a young adult novel written by Meg Cabot. It is the fourth part of The Mediator series. The novel was first published in 2001 and was the last of the series to appear under the pseudonym Jenny Carroll. In the UK, it was published with the title Young Blood.
Synopsis.
Suze Simon is forced to work a summer job by her stepfather, Andy. She becomes a babysitter at the Pebble Beach Hotel and Golf Resort, where her usual charge is eight-year-old Jack Slater. Suze soon realizes that Jack is miserable because he can see dead people; he is also a mediator. She helps him realizes that ghosts do not mean to do any harm and just want help to go to the afterlife. Soon he becomes more like a typical eight-year-old boy. His older brother, Paul, is impressed by the changes in his brother and asks Suze to join them for dinner, but she refuses and avoids talking to Paul.
Suze's routine is interrupted when her stepfather and stepbrother dig up something in the backyard: letters from a person named Maria de Silva to her fiance, Hector de Silva. Suze realizes that these letters belonged to Jesse. Problems start as Suze is threatened by Maria's ghost, who does not want them to find the letters. Maria starts harassing Suze's family. Suze fears that if she finds Jesse's remains in the backyard, Jesse will move on to the next world.
Suze attempts to give the letters to the Historical Center, where the conservator, Dr. Clive Clemmings, thinks Jesse did not die from murder but ran away from his wedding. Suze notices Maria's picture and a portrait of Jesse in the museum. 
The following day, Suze is confronted by the police, who inform her that the conservator is dead and Hector de Silva's portrait is missing. Paul stops them from inquiring her further, saying that he can "attract more flies with honey rather than vinegar", and she finally agrees to go on a date with him.
As Suze returns home from the date, Brad and Andy unearth Jesse's remains in the backyard. Suze assures herself, when she can't find Jesse, that he is only away for a time. Jack then calls her to inform her of his successful exorcism of the "ghost who was bothering Suze" for a long time. 
Suze is horrified. She is attacked by Maria de Silva and Felix Diego, her late husband, who helped kill Jesse in the past. They try to kill her, but only give her a concussion by throwing her in the hole Andy and Brad had been working on. The next day, Suze orders Jack to exorcise her. She believes that if she ends up in the same place as Jesse, she can bring him back. Hhowever, Father Dominic prevents the process from occurring.
Father Dom agrees on doing a "proper exorcism" in the Mission. Suze has thirty minutes to find Jesse and come back, or she will die. Jack arrives with a rope to tie around her waist to help her get back.
Suze finds Jesse on the "other side". Jesse initially thinks that Suze exorcised him and then becomes concerned about her safety, attempting to lead her back to their world. However, they become lost because Maria cut Suze's rope. Paul (who is also a mediator) arrives and taunts them. Suze realizes that Paul has been working with Maria and Felix, distracting Suze from saving Jesse from being exorcised. Jesse, furious with Paul's selfish outlook on the mediator "gift", punches him. They barely make it back to the Mission, only to find Maria and Felix Diego attacking Father Dominic. Suze manages to exorcize Maria and Felix, and Jesse decides to stay in the living world.
The Slaters leave the hotel, leaving Suze a huge tip and some cryptic letters. As Suze goes up, she finds Jesse wanting to talk. She says she does not want to talk, for fear of confessing her feelings, but Jesse kisses her.

Ô ăn quan

Ô ăn quan (literally: Mandarin Square Capturing) is a traditional Vietnamese children's board game, primarily played by girls. This game is valuable for enhancing calculating ability.
History.
The game's origin is still a mystery to the Vietnamese people, as it has been played for many years. Many people say that Vietnamese ancestors were inspired by green rice fields to invent a game that could be played in those huge fields. At first, the game had become quite popular throughout the country. However, as time passed Vietnamese children no longer had the same passion for the game like those in the past. For this reason, the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology is exhibiting the game with fully explained instructions with the aim of keeping the game alive among children nowadays.
According to many researchers, Ô Ăn Quan belongs to Mancala.
Rules.
Setup.
Each player places one big stone or ten small stones (called the "Mandarin piece") in the Mandarin square as well as five small stones (called "citizen pieces") in each of the rice field squares.
Object.
The game ends when all the pieces are captured. 
If both Mandarin pieces are captured, the remaining citizen pieces belong to the player controlling the side that these pieces are on. There is a Vietnamese saying to express this situation: ""hết quan, tàn dân, thu quân, bán ruộng"" (literally: "Mandarin is gone, citizen dismisses, take back the army, selling the rice field") or ""hết quan, tàn dân, thu quân, kéo về"" (literally: "Mandarin is gone, citizen dismisses, take back the army, retreat") 
Whichever player has more pieces is the winner (a Mandarin piece is equal to ten or five citizen pieces).
Scattering.
Players play rock paper scissors to determine the first player.
The first player takes up all the pieces of any rice field square on his/her side of the board and distributes (Vietnamese: "rải": literally: scatter) one piece per square, starting at the next square in either direction. When all pieces are distributed, the player repeats by taking up the pieces of the following square and distributing them.
If his/her side of the board is empty, he/she must use five previously-won pieces to place one piece in each square on his/her side before repeating the distribution. (If he/she do not possess any pieces, he/she must borrow a piece from the other player and return it when counting the points at the end of the game.)
Capturing.
When the next square to be distributed is empty, the player wins all the pieces in the square after that. A square that contains a lot of pieces is the "nhà giàu" square (literally: rich square). 
When the next square is an empty Mandarin square, or the next two squares the are empty, it becomes the other player's turn. 
In some game variations, the Mandarin square can contain little citizen pieces called "quan non" (literally: quan: Madarin, non: young/unripen) which may not be captured.
Song.
The song (Vietnamese: "đồng dao") is used when playing this game:
Variant.
A variation of this game exists for three or four players.

Kangra Valley Railway

The Kangra Valley Railway lies in the sub-Himalayan region and covers a distance of from Pathankot, Punjab to Jogindernagar in Himachal Pradesh, India. The Kangra valley railway comes under the Firozpur division of Northern Railway. It is one of two mountain railways that run in Himachal Pradesh, the other being Kalka-Shimla Railway, which has been designated as world heritage site by UNESCO. Both of these currently run at a Two foot six inch gauge railways narrow gauge, although they do not connect to each other. The Kangra Valley Railway is among in the tentative list of UNESCO world heritage sites. Indian Railways has identified Pathankot-Jogindernagar route to be converted into and to extend it to Mandi, and eventually to Ladakh via a new Bilaspur-Mandi-Leh Railway.
Kangra is a hilly region in Himachal Pradesh which has an average elevation of .
History.
The railway line was planned in May 1926 and commissioned in 1929. The highest point on this line is at Ahju station at an elevation of . The terminus at Joginder Nagar is at an elevation of .
About.
The Kangra Valley is not one place in particular. It happens to be the name given to the entire region that lies between the Dhauladhar ranges of the Himalayas to the north and the last strangling foothills to the south. So, roughly speaking, this talk is about a narrow rectangular belt running 150 km in length and 50 km in breadth through the mountains. To the north, the peaks rear skyward; first a low chain of ridges followed by an extensive line averaging between 7,000 and 9,000 feet. Directly behind those are massifs rising from 13,000 to well over 16,000 feet. Then the snows.
Anything else would have ruined it. A different alignment, a different mode of taking the railway through the maze of hills and valleys would have spoilt its picture postcard perfectness. This unique line has just two tunnels, one of which is only 250 feet and the other 1,000 feet in length. The traveler must remember this is a total distance of 103 miles. Instead of boring his way through the mountains, the railway engineer has skillfully avoided running head first into the hillside. Instead of following dizzy curves, he has cleverly chosen to avoid the awkward corners and straighten his turning. For the Kangra Valley Railway presents to the traveler, a chance to gaze as long as he likes on the ever present panorama of snow-clad ranges and the gold green fields without being swung round every few minutes on a narrow arc before his eyes can greet the scenery.
Certainly the scenery through which the train passes is ample compensation for the extra distance covered as compared to getting there by road. The most picturesque parts of the valley are exposed to the view – the stretch of 18 miles from Mangwal to Kangra, for example, lies through country unsurpassed for its majestic grandeur with the majestic Ban Ganga gorge and the deep Kangra chasm as two piece de resistance. As one approaches Palampur, the ever present background of snowy chain peaks, 15,000 and 16,000 feet in height is barely ten miles away. From here onwards, the line runs parallel to the Dhauladhar range and much nearer to it than any other railways in India that ever comes so close to the eternal snows.
Services.
Currently all the services are passenger trains i.e. the trains stop at all stations of II-class and some trains also have FC-class of accommodation. Some specials are run during the holiday season. Chartered trains can also be booked.

Disaster Response Route

Disaster Response Route (DRR) is a network of pre-identified municipal and provincial roads in the Province of British Columbia, Canada that can best move emergency services and supplies to where they are needed in the event of a major disaster. These roads are part of the Coordinated Regional Emergency Transportation Strategy and are intended for emergency responders when a disaster strikes and are not evacuation routes for the public.
History.
DRR came upon to the Province after witnessing the traffic mayhem after disasters like the 1989 San Francisco, 1994 Los Angeles earthquakes, September 11 terrorist attack. It was decided that BC will require a system to control post-disaster traffic and BC became the first jurisdiction in the world to implement a disaster response road plan in 1995. In the original plan, only Vancouver roads were considered but eventually expanded to marine routes, railways and air transports.
DRR roads are capable of withstanding natural disasters and the roads all link to Abbotsford, more specifically to Abbotsford International Airport. While DRR consists mostly of roads, emergency plans also includes marine routes suitable for quick access for responders.
There were confusion since the launch of the program with the general public - the original sign did not include the third tab (Emergency Vehicles Only During a Disaster) which led many to believe these roads are for evacuation when disaster strikes. Since 2004, the Ministry of Transportation added the third tab and increased public awareness to promote the correct use of these roads during a disaster.
Operation.
Roads that are pre-marked as DRR are open to the general public unless a state of emergency was declared by the municipal or provincial government. Once a state of emergency is declared, DRR can be activated and the local police will be responsible for cordoning off the roads. As soon as possible, the public will be allowed back onto the Disaster Response Routes.
DRR is intended for those who have the following function to access the roads within 72 hours of a disaster strikes:
Specifically, 'DRR users' are categorized into 3 groups:
Once activated, only those who have been issued with DRR hangers (for automobiles) or DRR decals (on Driver's license, employee ID or government IDs) will be able to access the designated roads.

Hi Ho! Cherry-O is a children's put and take board game currently published by Milton Bradley in which two to four players spin a spinner in an attempt to collect cherries. The original edition, designed by Hermann Wernhard and first published in 1960 by Whitman Publishers , had players compete to collect 10 cherries. During an update in 2007, the rules were updated to include a cooperative play variant, where players cooperate to remove all fruit from the board before a bird puzzle is completed.

TP-13

TP-13 is an anxiolytic drug with a novel chemical structure, which is used in scientific research. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. It is a subtype-selective partial agonist at GABAA receptors, binding selectively to GABAA receptor complexes bearing α2 and α3 subunits. It has modest anticonvulsant activity although less than that of diazepam, and its main effect is likely to be selective anxiolytic action, as seen with other related α2/3-preferring agonists such as L-838,417.

Basil Brooke (Royal Navy admiral)

Vice-Admiral Basil Charles Barrington Brooke, CB, CBE, DL, JP (6 April 1895 – 20 January 1983) was an English admiral and cricketer, who also played for the Singapore national cricket team. He played twice for the Royal Navy Cricket Club in first-class cricket. A member of the Brooke family which ruled the Kingdom of Sarawak from 1841 to 1946, he commanded the battle cruiser HMS Renown during the Second World War.
Early life and family.
Brooke was born at Boddington House, Byfield in Northamptonshire, England, the eldest son of John Charles Evelyn Hope Brooke (13 November 1858 – 19 June 1934), who was the grand-nephew of Sir James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak and who had been born there, and of The Hon. Violet Mary Barrington (9 May 1872 – 10 December 1938), who was the second daughter of the ninth Viscount Barrington.
Brooke had nine other siblings: Anne Violet (1893–1950), Beryl Mary (1894–1969), Alaric (1897–1962), John (b. 1899), Rupert (b. 1900), Joan (b. 1902), Mollie Laura (b. 1903), Ruth (b. 1904) and Bruce (b. 1906)
Naval career.
Educated at Malvern College, Brooke joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1913, seeing service during the First World War. He received a promotion to Lieutenant in March 1918 and was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander in March 1926, after which he undertook the staff course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.
On 16 April 1925, he married Nora Evelyn Toppin (d. 1981); the couple had four children: Peter Barrington (1926–1998), Isabel Ann (1929–), Julian Hope (1930–) and Jennifer (1932–).
Brooke was promoted to Commander in 1931. From November 1933 until February 1936, he commanded the cruiser HMS Philomel, also serving as Naval Officer-in-Charge at Auckland. He then commanded the new cruiser HMS Orion on the America and West Indies station from August 1936 until June 1938, when he received a promotion to Captain.
Just prior to the outbreak of hostilities in September 1939, Brooke was assigned to the cruiser HMS Curlew, which he commanded until it was sunk by the "Luftwaffe" off Narvik on 26 May 1940. He then became the captain of the light cruiser HMS Southampton from August of that year until it was also sunk of Malta by the Luftwaffe on 11 January 1941. He was promoted to Commodore in February 1943, commanding Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation 1 until that October.
In November, Brooke was given command of the battle cruiser HMS Renown, and held this command until July 1945. After the war, he served as Commodore of the naval barracks at Chatham from January to April 1946. He was appointed a CBE in June 1946., retiring in November. He was promoted to Vice-Admiral on the retired list in December 1950.
Later life.
Brooke subsequently served as a Deputy Lieutenant and JP for East Lothian. He died at Saffron Walden, Essex, on 20 January 1983, aged 87.
Cricket career.
He made his first-class debut in 1919 against Cambridge University, taking the wicket of future England Test player George Wood. He played one more first-class match, also for the Royal Navy, against the British Army cricket team in 1926. In 1927, he played twice for Singapore against WAS Oldfield's XI.

Flame speed

The flame speed is the measured rate of expansion of the flame front in a combustion reaction. Whereas "flame speed" is generally used for a fuel, a related term is explosive velocity, which is the same relationship measured for an explosive. Combustion engineers differentiate between the laminar flame speed and turbulent flame speed. Flame speed is typically measured in m/s, cm/s, etc.
In engines.
In an internal combustion engine, the flame speed of a fuel is a property which determines its ability to undergo controlled combustion without detonation. Flame speed is used along with adiabatic flame temperature to help determine the engine's efficiency. According to one source,
"...high flame-speed combustion processes, which closely approximate constant-volume processes, should reflect in high efficiencies."
The flame speed for a gas engine is typically 16.5 m/s.

He becomes friendly with the family of his main suspect, resulting in emotional complications.
Plot.
Father Tomasino is stabbed to death. San Francisco traffic cop Joe Martini felt the priest was like an actual father to him. He asks to assist homicide Lieutenant Kilrain in his investigation, but after being rejected, Joe quits the force.
He has a hunch restaurant owner Sylvio Malatesta could be involved. Joe is warmly welcomed by Sylvio's family, however, and falls in love with a cousin, Anna. He hides his past identity as a cop from her.
Something is troubling Sylvio, but the family believes he still misses a sweetheart killed in Italy during the war. Sylvio also has a alibi for the night of the priest's murder, but Sergeant Gillen gets word to Joe that the alibi is a fake.
In a ploy to encourage Sylvio to confide in him, Joe pretends to be a murder suspect himself. Sylvio breaks down and admits to having killed his own sweetheart, then the priest as well after confiding to him about the murder in confession. Sylvio runs into the street and is struck by a moving vehicle. Dying, he begs for Joe's forgiveness.

Grassfields Bantu languages

The Grassfields or Grassfields Bantu languages, spoken in the Western grassfields of Cameroon, are a branch of Benue–Congo and a sister group to the Bantu languages. Better-known Grassfields languages include the Eastern Grassfields languages Bamun, Yamba, and Bamileke, and the Ring language Kom. 
The languages are closely related, sharing approximately half of their vocabulary. 
The Grassfields languages were previously known as "Grassfields Bantu" and "Semi-Bantu." They are sometimes classified on two levels, "Wide Grassfields," which includes all the languages, and "Narrow Grassfields," which excludes Menchum, Ambele, and sometimes the Southwestern Grassfields languages. These may form a group of their own, which Nurse (2003) calls Peripheral Grassfields but rejects. 
Blench (2010) notes there is little evidence for the traditional assumption that non-Western Momo belongs in Grassfields, and that it may actually be closer to the poorly established Tivoid group; Western Momo is therefore renamed Southwest Grassfields to avoid confusion, and only Menchum and Ambele are left out of Narrow Grassfields. The classification of Amebele is unclear, though it is clearly divergent, and Menchum may be closer to the Tivoid languages (Blench 2011). Blench (2012) suggests that Western Beboid may belong here.
Viti (Vötö) is unclassified Narrow Grasslands.
The Eastern Grassfields languages share nasal noun-class prefixes with the Bantu languages, which are not found in the other branches of Grassfields. However, they appear to be more closely related to the rest of Grassfields than they are to Bantu.

A Girl in Australia

A Girl in Australia () is a 1971 Italian comedy film directed by Luigi Zampa, with stars Alberto Sordi and Claudia Cardinale.
Plot.
At the end of World War II, the promise of jobs and a chance to start a new life induced tens of thousands of young Italians to join the post-war immigration to Australia. In 1971, having lived about twenty-five years Down Under, one of those immigrants, middle-aged Amedeo Battipaglia, a lineman in the remote New South Wales settlement bearing the (fictional) name of Bun Bun Ga, several kilometers from the outback city of Broken Hill, is about to meet Carmela, his prospective bride from Rome, with whom he has been corresponding. Each of them misrepresented facts to the other — Carmela, a very attractive woman in her early thirties, is a semiliterate prostitute seeking an opportunity to get away from her abusive pimp, with the letters to Amedeo ghostwritten by her friend Rosalba, while Amedeo, feeling inadequate about his ordinary appearance, sent Carmela a photograph, taken about twenty years earlier, of himself between two Italian immigrant friends, Giuseppe Bartoni and Bampo. The arrow in the photo, however, is over Giuseppe because, when Amedeo visited his tall, handsome friend for advice, Giuseppe erased the arrow over Amedeo's head and pencilled it over his own head. 
In Rome, getting a ride to the airport on the back of a friend's motorcycle, with her pimp in pursuit, Carmela arrives at the boarding gate, meets Rosalba who hands her the travel documents, has a final across-the-gate shouting match with her pimp, and takes a seat in Qantas first class next to a turbaned passenger perusing "LIFE" (issue of February 19, 1971). A stewardess points out that her ticket is for tourist class with special discount for immigrants. Meanwhile, Amedeo drives his substandard auto nearly 1600 kilometers to Brisbane Airport, where Carmela's flight, filled with other Italian mail-order brides (as well as those from neighboring Yugoslavia) will land. Sitting at the airport lounge with numerous Italian men awaiting their future wives, they pass around outdated photographs that the women had sent to their prospective mates and speculate whether their appearances had changed. Still uncertain of recognizing Carmela from the black-and-white photo of her as a young peasant girl, he examines and questions a few of the newly arrived women and then is hit with realization as she slowly comes into view on the down escalator. Becoming disconcerted by her beauty, he retreats to the airport's bar where, sharing a drink with a balding Italian who sent a photo of himself with a full head of hair, he expresses his own self-doubts. Convinced that she will reject him, he returns to the arrivals area, introduces himself as Giuseppe and hands her a note, purportedly written by Amedeo, explaining that he is ill with the flu and requesting that Giuseppe, a trusted friend, provide an escort to her new home. 
Unable to decide how to resolve this situation, Amedeo tells Carmela that driving to Giuseppe's home in Broken Hill would take three days, but as the trip starts, they are seen riding not southwest of Brisbane, but thousands of kilometers off-course in the city of Cairns, a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland's tropical far north. The brightly colored lush greenery provides a picturesque background for an eventful multi-day journey down the coast of eastern Australia, with one of the stops at Barrier Reef's Dunk Island, a popular tourist vacation spot, which provides the opportunity for the rental of a rowboat and, as Amedeo rows, Carmela strips to her underwear and dives into the warm water, revealing her skill as an expert swimmer, speedily maneuvering amidst brilliantly colored fish and corals, while Amedeo sits in the boat, peering downward with concern. As the long trip to Broken Hill continues, they become better acquainted and she learns of his hardships as an immigrant and also finds out, since it happens in front of her, that, due to a years-earlier bout of malaria, he is subject to occasional epileptic-like convulsions which leave him unable to function for a few hours. Further along, they stop for a visit to the nursing home where Bampo is a long-term patient, having become unresponsive as a result of malarial damage to his brain and nervous system.
As Amedeo's small auto, unable to withstand the long journey, breaks down, they push and pull into a town and try to sell it in an Italian-speaking neighborhood, but run into some hostile local Italians who force Carmela into their car and drive away with her while Amedeo hangs on to their door handle, as the car veers off into a ditch and flips on its side. Shaken but unhurt, they go off to board a train, but when he has another malarial attack during a station stop and she rushes off the train to get help, it pulls out, leaving her behind. Seeing no other recourse, she decides to briefly take up her former profession in order to earn enough for continuing the journey. Now on her own, she takes a later train and, as it stops at the small town of Menindee, she sees Amedeo waiting at the station. Reunited, they continue to Broken Hill, which is a little over a hundred kilometers further. Upon arrival, Carmela meets Giuseppe, whom Amedeo, still pretending to be Giuseppe, introduces as her betrothed, Amedeo. After a few pleasantries, Giuseppe who, as it turns out, is himself a pimp, leaves after driving Carmela to the back entrance of what he describes as her new apartment, but which quickly reveals itself as a prostitute's walk-up house situated in the city's red light district amidst numerous other such dwellings, each with its own resident "working girl" sitting on the porch. Amedeo finds out where Giuseppe has taken Carmela, goes to the red light neighborhood and approaches her porch, hoping to offer an explanation, but she goes inside to get her switchblade and attacks him, inflicting a stab wound in his shoulder. 
Eventually, Carmela and Amedeo, with his arm in a sling, are on a train, as he is still trying to convince her of his honorable intentions by offering to pay for her trip back to Italy but she begins to cry that she was a prostitute there and, upon returning, would be beaten by her pimp. Dismayed and outraged, he jumps up and exclaims (in Italian) to all the passengers that she has cheated and deceived him, but when she tells him that he was equally untruthful, he says that he forgives her and she slaps him, retorting that no one needs his forgiveness. At this point, the train is slowing to a stop and, upon spotting from the window the remoteness of the outback, she refuses to disembark at the tiny Bun Bun Ga railway shack "in the middle of the desert". As she is cajoled and then forcibly pulled off the train by Amedeo and two of his Italian friends who regularly travel this route, the spectacle is witnessed, several meters further, by the group of local English-speaking residents, brandishing a "WELCOME CARMELA" sign, who had come to meet the train. As Amedeo and Carmela approach, a little girl among the greeters slips a 45" record into a portable player which starts to emit Wagner's "Bridal Chorus", while one of the men takes out a sheet of paper and reads a speech, which Amedeo interprets for Carmela into Italian: "Dear Carmela, this is a historical day for Bun Bun Ga. Carmela, you come from the noble and ancient country that is Italy. The country of Julius Caesar, the country of Michelangelo, of Galileo, the country of Guglielmo Marconi, the country of Caruso, of Bartali, and Pope Giovanni. Carmela, you come to this corner of the desert to bring us a little breath of your old civilisation." As the train leaves the station, Amedeo can be seen through one of its windows carrying Carmela bridegroom-style into his/their house.
Production.
The film was shot in Australia in February and March 1971 and recorded in Italy.

Karabin maszynowy obserwatora wz.37

The karabin maszynowy obserwatora wz.37 (Polish for "observers machine gun") is a Polish version of the Browning wz.1928. It was a flexible machine gun used in the some Polish airplanes in the beginning of World War II.
History.
In mid-1930s Polish small arms designer Wawrzyniec Lewandowski was charged with developing a flexible gun based on Browning wz.1928. The changes included rising theoretical rate of fire to 1100 rds/min, eliminating buttstock, adding spade grip in the rear of receiver, moving the main spring under barrel and most importantly changing the feed system. Keeping the 20 rds box magazine was impossible in the gun firing so fast. The solution was found in developing feeding mechanism, which was added as a pack to standard receiver. It contained a spring-loaded lever, which pressed by the lock during locking would grab a round from 91 rds pan magazine located over receiver and force the round into feed line during unlocking.
The weapon is world's only specialised aerial flexible machine gun based closely on M1918.
The wz.37 was dubbed "Szczeniak" (Polish for pup) due to its lightness and compactness compared with previously used Vickers E and Vickers F machine guns. The wz.37 was used mostly in Polish PZL.37 Łoś bombers.

Palm Jumeirah Monorail

The Palm Jumeirah Monorail is a monorail line on the Palm Jumeirah island in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The monorail connects the Palm Jumeirah to the mainland, with a planned further extension to the Red Line of the Dubai Metro. The line opened on April 30, 2009. It is the first monorail in the Middle East.
The trains are driverless, with attendants for any emergency situations.
History.
Construction began on the monorail line in March 2006, under the supervision of Marubeni Corporation, with the monorail track completed in July 2008 and vehicle testing beginning in November 2008. Originally planned to open by December 2008, the opening was delayed to April 30, 2009. In 2010, day-to-day operations were taken over by the Middle-East branch of Serco.
The project budget is US$400 million, with an additional US$190M set aside for a future extension to the Dubai Metro. Another source speaks of a budget of US$1.1 billion. A journey on the monorail costs Dhs15 one-way, 25 return.
Technology.
The Palm Jumeirah Monorail uses Hitachi Monorail straddle-type technology. The line has a capacity of 40,000 passengers per day, with trains running every three minutes during peak hours and every 15 to 20 minutes during off-peak hours. However, actual ridership averaged around 600 passengers per day during the first week, and the monorail is running "virtually empty".
The electro-mechanical works are carried out by ETA-Dubai in joint venture with Hitachi-Japan.
Stations.
, only the Atlantis Aquaventure and Gateway stations are open.

Ali Kordan

Ali Kordan (23 October 1958 – 22 November 2009) was an Iranian conservative politician who served in the Revolutionary Guards, the judiciary and as deputy oil minister, before becoming interior minister of Iran in 2008 for just 90 days. He was impeached by the Iranian Parliament on 4 November 2008 after a doctorate he claimed to hold turned out to be fraudulent.
Career.
Kordan was a former revolutionary guard and a veteran of the Iraq war. He previously served as deputy labour minister, president of Iran's technical and vocational organization, deputy head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) for provincial and parliamentary affairs, deputy head of IRIB for administrative and financial affairs, and deputy minister for culture and Islamic guidance for administrative and financial affairs.
He also served in the Iranian judiciary. He was appointed deputy oil minister in October 2007, which he had turned down in 2006. 
In 2008, President Ahmadinejad nominated Kordan as the interior minister in a cabinet reshuffle. He was confirmed by the Parliament by 169 votes to 100 in August 2008. However, during his confirmation debate in the parliament, questions arose among MPs and in the media over his qualifications and over a doctorate he claimed to have received. Kordan replaced Mostafa Pour Mohammadi in the post.
Controversy.
During his tenure as the deputy head of IRIB in financial affairs, Ali Kordan was accused of a high-profile financial corruption (525 billion Tomans). However the judiciary system did not charge him after a long investigation. "Kayhan" published an article accusing Kordan of corruption in "The Crescent File".
Kordan claimed to have an honorary doctorate in law from the University of Oxford. When questioned about this, he released a document stating that such a degree had been conferred on him in June 2000 and under-signed by three Oxford University professors. A copy of the certificate was released. Alef, a website "associated with one of Ahmadinejad's critics", pointed to "typing errors, garbled English and misspellings". The document stated Kordan "has shown a great effort in preparing educational materials and his research in the domain of comparative law, that has opened a new chapter, not only in our university, but, to our knowledge, in this country".
Kordan was granted the degree "to be from scientific privileges"; "entitled" was spelt "intitled", and spaces were left out after commas. Responding to an inquiry by Alef news agency, on 11 August 2008, Oxford University denied it had awarded Kordan an honorary doctorate of law or any other degree. Four days later, the university published an official statement on its website that they had no record of Kordan having received any degree, honorary or otherwise. 
It noted that none of the professors whose alleged signatures were on the certificate were working in the field of law, and none of them would sign degree certificates. As a result, chairman of Iranian parliament Ali Larijani initiated an investigation into the validity of Kordan's degree. It was later revealed, according to news service MSNBC, that Kordan did not receive two other degrees he had claimed, a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Iran's Azad University.
Two days after the Oxford University response, IRNA reported that the Tehran prosecutor's office announced that investigating Alef news website had been "banned based on complaints by legal entities". It was reported that Alef had been blocked by the Iranian "authorities". As of 27 August 2008, the ministry of science, research and technology denied announcing any statement on Kordan's doctorate degree.
On 27 September 2008, in a letter to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Kordan admitted that the degree was fake, explaining that he had been deceived by a "person who claimed to represent Oxford University in Tehran". After holding the degree for eight years, he was astonished to learn that "the university did not confirm (the degree) when my representative went there". Kordan said his search for this fraudulent Oxford intermediary had proven fruitless but that he had filed a complaint against the person, whom he did not name, on 14 September. Kordan also accused the media of a smear campaign by portraying him as a "terrorist".
Impeachment.
On 4 November 2008, the Iranian parliament voted to impeach interior minister Ali Kordan for lying about his credentials and presenting a fake degree from Oxford University. Out of 247 MPs present, 188 voted to impeach Kordan, with 14 lawmakers against the motion and 45 abstentions.
Death.
Kordan died of multiple myeloma at Tehran's Masihe Daneshvari hospital on 22 November 2009 at the age of 51. He had also suffered from influenza and a brain hemorrhage.
