Charlie Chaplin (film)

Charlie Chaplin is a 2002 Tamil comedy film directed by Sakthi Chidambaram, starring Prabhu Ganesan and Prabhu Deva. The film's commercial success led to remakes into Telugu ("Pellam Oorelithe"), Hindi ("No Entry"), Malayalam ("Happy Husbands") and Kannada languages ("Kalla Malla Sulla"). Prabhu won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his performance in the film.
Plot.
Ramakrishnan (Prabhu Ganesan) has a suspicious-minded wife, Mythili (Abhirami), who thinks he is always having an affair with another woman, even though he is extremely faithful to her and wouldn't dream of betraying her in any way. Vishva (Livingston) has been married to a trusting Amudha (Vindhya) for several years. Seemingly unknown to Amudha, he has been having several affairs with numerous gorgeous women, but in the end she reveals that she knew all along and thought that he would change ("I want you to be my husband in all my births"). There is also Ramakrishnan's friend Thiru (Prabhu Deva) who falls accidentally in love with Susi (Gayatri Raguram). Ramakrishnan meets Tilotama (Monal) who is a call girl (She is set up by Vishva and he goes abroad). Mythili goes to her relatives house for two days, at which point Thilothama arrives to meet Ramakrishnan. Ramakrishnan considers sleeping with her but determines not to have the affair. But his wife, having forgotten something, comes back just in time to see her husband with Thilothama. Then some fun and twists come and they all get caught including Ramakrishnan. At the court Ramakrishnan's wife wants divorce. Ramakrishnan manages to convince his wife that he is true to her, and they live happily ever after. Thiru settles down as well, after Ramakrishnan discovers that his wife is pregnant.
Production.
Sakthi Chidambaram revealed that the story was based on a real life incident that had happened to his friend, but altered the happenings to present it in a comedy format. The initial choices for the two leading female roles had been Gayatri Jayaraman and Sanghavi, but the two were replaced due to date issues.
Soundtrack.
There are the 7 songs in this film composed by Bharani.

New Play Project

New Play Project is a non-profit organization founded in Provo, Utah, by four Brigham Young University students. NPP is dedicated to writing and producing new plays that reflect the standards of a Utah Valley audience. They also aim to give emerging Latter-day Saint writers a place to produce their work while maintaining their standards and values. It primarily produces short play festivals (several short plays bound together by one theme), but occasionally takes on larger projects (as in "Really Cool and Smart and Better Than You" and "Swallow the Sun"). It is the first such organization to flourish in the area (which is known for theater performance), and has produced more than 70 original plays (and workshopped more than 200) since its inception in 2006.
Origins.
New Play Project was founded April 2006 by Brigham Young University students James Goldberg, Arisael Rivera, Julie Saunders and Jennefer Franklin as an attempt to produce new play scripts they developed. Bianca Dillard almost immediately joined the group and developed the continuing workshop program.
In August 2006, sponsored by the BYU Experimental Theatre Group, it held its first production, a 10-minute play festival titled "Love Songs and Negotiations". In October 2006 it held another play festival titled "Palms," which featured plays revolving around religious themes. At the beginning of December 2006, it held its last play festival of the year titled "In Progress".
In 2007, New Play Project officially separated itself from BYU and was incorporated with the state of Utah as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. The next seven shows were performed in Provo City Library's Bullock Room. In December 2007, New Play Project moved to its current home at 105 N. 100 East: Provo Theatre Company's building.
Recognition.
The goal of New Play Project is to not only create positive, uplifting media for local audiences, but to create great writers who can make a difference in the mass media. In 2007, two NPP writers' works were chosen for Specific Gravity Ensemble's Elevator Plays. SGE is a Louisville, KY-based theater company.
Development.
Part of New Play Project's goal is education. They work to develop new writers, actors, and directors, and hone their skills. They do this both through play writing workshops and through their short play productions.
Writing is the most important aspect of New Play Project. The heart of NPP is new work. NPP welcomes submissions from anyone for their themed productions. If submitted early before deadlines, the directors are willing to give feedback, and even have a workshop program for playwrights trying to develop both their short and full-length scripts.
Because NPP generally produces short plays, actors sometimes only need to spend 2–5 hours per week in rehearsal and have a much lower memorization burden than in most plays. No previous acting experience is required, and directors work with actors to develop good acting skills.
As with acting, the ten-minute play format provides opportunities for many beginning and experienced directors without the time-consumption of managing and blocking a full-length production. Previous directing or acting experience is required for directors, and NPP generally gives preference to those who have worked on previous NPP production (in any capacity).
NPP also includes dramaturgs in its productions. In NPP, dramaturgs help find additional information and images that help the director and actors better understand the script in terms of its larger context. They also create written and visual aids to help audience members connect the script to issues in their own lives and the world around them. Dramaturgs also help during the script development process to give articulate feedback on scripts to improve them. They are heavily utilized in the play writing workshop program.
"Out of the Mount".
In 2010, Davey Morrison edited a collection of NPP's work, "Out of the Mount: 19 from New Play Project", published by Peculiar Pages. The book allowed NPP's work to travel outside of Utah and it "ably makes its claim as one of the most ambitious and vibrant going concerns in the world of LDS culture."

<doc id="18618784" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18618784" title="Calocybe carnea">
Calocybe carnea

Calocybe carnea is a small pink-capped mushroom with white gills that can be found in grassy meadows, fields, or on lawns from spring to autumn in Europe and North America. Its common names include pink fairhead and pink domecap.
Taxonomy.
Originally described as "Agaricus carneus" by the French mycologist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard in 1792, this small pink mushroom has been through many taxonomical name changes over many years, and as a result has had many binomial names. A few of these are listed in the Synonyms section in the box at right. Its current specific epithet, "carnea", is derived from the Latin for "flesh-coloured". The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek terms "kalos" "pretty", and "cubos" "head".
Description.
The cap is 1.5–4 cm (0.6–1.6 in) in diameter. It is usually pale pink, but can be darker, pinker, or redder. It usually fades with age. At first it is convex, but later flattens, and has a tendency to become wavy. It is smooth and dry. The stem is up to 4 cm (1.6 in) high and the same colour as the cap, and is smooth, or finely fibrillose; often narrowing towards the base, and often misshapen. The gills are adnexed to almost free; sometimes notched and are white, giving a spore print of the same colour. They are quite closely spaced initially. The flesh is white; with very little taste, or smell.
A similar species, "Calocybe persicolor" (Fr.) Singer, grows in tufts, has a liking for manured ground, and is sometimes recorded as a variety or variant of "C. carnea".
Distribution and habitat.
"Calocybe carnea" appears in spring, summer, and early autumn (usually after rain). It is frequent in Britain, Europe, Asia, and North America, growing in grassy meadows and fields and on lawns. It is very rarely found in woods, unless a grassy clearing is present. It seems to tolerate agricultural practices, because its fruiting bodies often appear on fertilized farmland.
Edibility.
This mushroom is edible, but is unsubstantial, as it is small and thin fleshed. It is also potentially confused with poisonous species.

Joseph McKeen

Joseph McKeen (October 15, 1757 – July 15, 1807) was the first president of Bowdoin College of Brunswick, Maine.
Life and career.
McKeen was born in Londonderry, New Hampshire, a town that his father and grandfather, John and James, who had come from the north of Ireland in 1718 to escape religious and political oppression, had helped to settle. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1774 when he was just seventeen years old. Except for a brief period when he fought under General John Sullivan in the American Revolution, he taught school in Londonderry until he became the Congregational minister of Beverly, Massachusetts in 1785.
He remained in that position as minister until 1802, when he became president of Bowdoin. At the time, Massachusetts Hall was the only building available for officers and pupils on campus. In his inaugural address, he famously said that "Literary institutions are founded and endowed for the common good, and not for the private advantage of those who resort to them for education." Bowdoin's annual Common Good Day for community service refers to this statement. He remained president until his death in 1807.
He received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Dartmouth in 1803. Most of McKeen's publications were papers in the"Transactions of the American Academy of Arts and Science" and some occasional sermons.
Legacy.
Bowdoin College inaugurated the "Joseph McKeen Center for the Common Good" in September 2008. The center provides programs for students, faculty, and staff to engage with the community through volunteerism, community-based teaching and research, and summer and post-graduate internships and fellowships. A large plaque that quotes a portion of McKeen's inaugural address is displayed in the center's hallway.

<doc id="18618903" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18618903" title="Mellor Hall">
Mellor Hall

Mellor Hall is a country hall in Mellor, Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It is located north of The Devonshire Arms in the western part of Mellor, off Longhurst Lane. 
The completion date of the present hall is uncertain but it is thought to be 1688. The hall and the adjoining farmhouse, dated to 1691 and originally a smithy, has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.
History.
Mellor Hall was historically the seat of the Mellor family from the 15th century, and afterwards belonged to the Radcliffes. In 1686, James Chetham purchased the Mellor and Botham Hall estates in Mellor from Susanna Radcliffe, daughter of William Radcliffe. It is believed that he ordered a rebuilding of the previous manor house; the year 1688 has been mentioned as the year of completion of the hall and 1691 as the year of completion of the farmhouse, which appears to have been used originally as a smithy. His great-grandson, Thomas Chetham of Highgate, Middlesex, sold the Bothams Hall estate in 1787 to local cotton magnate Samuel Oldknow, and the Mellor Hall estate to Ralph Bridge in about 1797. Bridge's son was using the hall as a farm house as of 1819. 
On 20 December 1967 the house became a Grade II* listed farmhouse. In 1978, Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council established the Mellor/Moorend Conservation Area on the border of Stockport and Derbyshire, which incorporates the hamlet of Moorend and outlying farms Longshaw Clough and Podnor, settlements at the end of Longhurst Lane, including Brook Bottom and Lower Hall and St Thomas’ Church and Mellor Hall. The conservation area was extended in 2007.
Architecture.
The main hall was completed in 1688 according to Nicholas Pevsner, and the adjoining farmhouse is dated "IC 1691". It is built of grey ashlar, with a graduated stone slate roof. The hall is a 2-storey building, with 7 bays on each floor, and a central door displaying a coat of arms and a steep broken swan-neck pediment. 6 of the ground floor windows are fitted with light ogee mullion and transom windows, with marginal glazing bars and keystones, and all of the 7 first floor windows are sash windows with marginal glazing bars, cyma-moulded surrounds and keystones. On the rear is a wing, with a hipped roof and quoins, mullion and transom windows; the 2 storey farmhouse extends from this wing, with 3 bays on each floor, and a central chimney stack. The interior is described as having a "massive hearth with segmental keystone arch."

Tyler Flowers

Cole Tyler Flowers (born January 24, 1986) is a professional baseball catcher and infielder for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball.
Playing career.
Atlanta Braves.
Flowers was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 33rd round of the 2005 MLB Draft.
In 2006 Flowers played 34 games played in his first professional season for the Rookie League Danville Braves. He hit .279 with 36 hits, 5 home runs and 16 RBIs playing 22 games at first and 8 as a catcher.
In 2007 he was the everyday first baseman/DH for the A-ball Rome Braves. He played in 106 games with a batting average of .298 with 116 hits (led the team), 12 homers (third most) 70 RBIs (tops on the club) and a .488 slugging percentage (third highest on the team). He started off slow in May (.238) and June (.257) before heating up in July (.352), August (.317) and September (.444)
In 2008 Flowers played for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of Advanced-A. He played 122 games, all at catcher. He had a .288 batting average, .427 on-base percentage, and .494 slugging percentage.
Chicago White Sox.
On December 4, 2008, Flowers and fellow Braves prospects Brent Lillibridge, Jonathan Gilmore and Santos Rodriguez were traded to the Chicago White Sox for Javier Vázquez and Boone Logan.
On September 1, 2009, Flowers was called up from AAA Charlotte Knights after hitting .297 with 15 home runs and 56 RBI between AA Birmingham Barons and AAA Charlotte Knights. He served as the Chicago White Sox third catcher. Flowers had his first major league hit on September 19, 2009 against the Kansas City Royals. In 10 games, Flowers finished the 2009 season batting .188 with no home runs and no RBIs.
Flowers started the 2010 season at AAA Charlotte. He hit .220 with 16 home runs and 53 RBI in 346 at-bats before getting another September call up. Flowers played in 8 games with the White Sox and only had 1 hit in 11 at-bats.
Flowers again started the 2011 season at AAA Charlotte. There he hit .261 with 15 home runs and 32 RBI in 222 at-bats. He was then called up in July to serve as the backup to A.J. Pierzynski after Ramón Castro went down with an injury. Flowers then became the stating catcher mid-August because of an injury to Pierzynski. Flowers hit his first Major League home run on August 13, 2011 against Luke Hochevar and the Kansas City Royals.
Flowers blasted his first Major League grand slam on August 28, 2011 against Jason Vargas and the Seattle Mariners.
With the departure of veteran catcher A.J. Pierzynski in the off season, Flowers became the starting catcher for the White Sox in 2013. Due to his poor play (apparently due to an injury sustained before the season began), Flowers was demoted to backup as the White Sox brought up one of their top rookie prospects, Josh Phegley. Flowers left in early September to have season-ending shoulder surgery. After the season, Flowers signed a one-year deal for $950,000 with Chicago, avoiding arbitration.

Peace Frogs

Peace Frogs is an American company founded by Catesby Jones in 1985. Based in Gloucester, Virginia, it is a branded apparel firm that offers a full line of clothing and accessories with distinguished frog designs. It specializes in youth, teenage and young adults clothing. The frog waving a peace sign is the official logo for the company.
Peace Frogs History.
The company started with the production of multi-colored shorts with international flags and Peace Frogs was the name chosen for this concept. The founder of Peace Frogs, Catesby Jones, claims that the frog is an American Indian symbol for peace and is recognized by some cultures as an icon for good luck. As the popularity of the frog itself increased, the focus shifted from the flag shorts to the production of items with designs of the appealing amphibian.
Products.
Peace Frogs products include a variety of t-shirts, sweatshirts, pajamas, hats, swimsuits, stickers and other items.
In 2007, the company introduced organic cotton T-shirts to its brand line. Peace Frogs claims that the cotton used in their shirts meets rigorous organic certification standards put forth by the USDA, that they are dyed and finished without the use of environmentally harmful chemicals, and that the products are cut and sewn in manufacturing facilities committed to socially responsible practices.
In 1998, the company introduced a mobile retail concept. Volkswagen vans and "Beetles", painted in bright colors, travel from one commercial location to another, selling Peace Frogs products. The company owns a fleet of 25 branded units that can be seen at different malls, shopping centers, concerts and theme parks around the country.
Frog Studies.
One of the concerns in the environmental world right now is the decline of amphibians. Recent studies revealed that in the last two decades there has been an alarming number extinctions and nearly one-third of the world’s amphibian species are threatened. The most important factor to amphibian population declines is habitat destruction. Peace Frogs supports various organizations that are strongly committed to this cause and other important environmental studies: Organization of Tropical Studies (OTS), Partners in Amphibian & Reptile Conservation (PARC), and others.

Each team will consist of 3 players and they don't have to participate in singles events (there are 22 additional athletes quota places for such players). Teams will be selected after all singles qualification events, and according a special May 2008 team ranking list. Qualification will be awarded first to the highest ranked teams with three players qualified for the singles event. If the quota hasn't been filled, selection will proceed to teams with two players qualified for the singles event, then to teams with only one singles qualifier.
If the field of 16 teams is filled without using all of the 22 athletes quota places, any unused places will be added to the Final World Qualification Tournament to select additional singles players. In order to select the Teams only the 64 qualified players will be taken into
consideration to establish the Special Olympic Computer Team Ranking (SOCTR). The SOCTR will be calculated in the same way as we calculate the current ITTF Computer Team Ranking now. The difference is that: Only the 64 players qualified will be considered to establish the SOCTR for the purpose of selecting the Teams.

Take This Waltz

"Take This Waltz" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, originally released as part the 1986 Federico García Lorca tribute album "Poets in New York (Poetas en Nueva York)" and as a single.
The song was later included in Cohen's 1988 studio album "I'm Your Man", in slightly re-arranged version (with addition of violin and Jennifer Warnes's duet vocals, both absent from the 1986 version). 
The song's lyrics are a loose translation, into English, of the poem "Pequeño vals vienés" by the Spanish poet F. G. Lorca (one of Cohen's favorite poets). The poem was first published in Lorca's seminal book "Poeta en Nueva York". 
The song reached number one in Spain in 1986.
Covers.
Actor/Singer Sven Wollter recorded a version of the song with lyrics translated into Swedish on his 1989 album "Nån sorts man".
Zorán Sztevanovity covered the song in 1991 with Cohen's original music but with different lyrics in Hungarian language written by his brother Dusán. The title of the song is "Volt egy tánc" ("There was a dance").
Enrique Morente and Lagartija Nick covered the song in 1996 with Cohen's music and Lorca's original verse on the album "Omega". Two years later, Spanish singer Ana Belén covered the song in Spanish for her album "Lorquiana". 
In 2009 Israel musician Shlomi Shaban covered the song in Hebrew for his tribute album "Tower of song" named after another song by Leonard Cohen covered there as well.
The film "Take This Waltz" directed by Sarah Polley takes its name from the song which was also featured prominently in the movie.

Echoes from a Ghost Minyan

Echoes From A Ghost Minyan is a 1998 documentary film about the once vibrant Jewish community of South Philadelphia. 
Plot summary.
On February 22, 1882, the "S.S. Illinois" docked at the foot of Federal Street on the Delaware River in South Philadelphia. Among the passengers on board were 225 European Jewish refugees, most of whom settled nearby. By the close of World War I, a little over 40 years later, South Philadelphia was home to over 100,000 Jewish immigrants, making it the second largest Jewish neighborhood in the United States. However, the thriving community didn't last long. Soon after World War II, the Jews began moving to other parts of the city and surrounding suburbs. By the beginning of the 21st century, the Jewish community of South Philadelphia had almost completely vanished. 
Using a mix of interviews, archival photographs, home movies and present day footage, "Echoes from a Ghost Minyan" documents a once thriving neighborhood by illuminating the lives and perceptions of those who once lived, worked and worshipped there, including the filmmakers themselves.
Filmmakers.
"Echoes From A Ghost Minyan" is the first film from writer/director/producer Joseph Van Blunk.

A. C. Frieden

A.C. Frieden, born André Frieden (1966, Dakar, Senegal) is a Swiss-Brazilian-American fiction author and attorney living in Chicago, Illinois. 
Biography.
Frieden, the son of a Swissair executive, spent most of his youth abroad. After leaving his birthplace in West Africa, he spent several years in Calcutta, India, then moved to Zurich and Geneva, Switzerland, and then to London, England, before emigrating with his parents to the southern United States in the early 1980s. In 1984, he returned to his native Switzerland to serve in the Swiss Army, where he trained as a marksman. He later came back to the U.S. to complete undergraduate and graduate studies in molecular biology in Texas, followed by his Juris Doctor in New Orleans, Louisiana. During that period he began his fiction writing, while continuing his legal education, including studies at Moscow State University law school in Russia and at the University of Vienna Juridicum in Austria. During law school he also worked as a legal analyst at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, and as a law clerk at Louisiana State University Medical Center. In 1997, Frieden moved to Chicago for an LL.M. in intellectual property law and to start his career as an associate attorney in a prominent law firm.
Since the mid-1980s, Frieden had visited dozens of countries, and what began as short stories, diaries and poems, many written during his travels, soon emerged as ingredients for future novels. Mysteries and thrillers soon became his passion. His first manuscript, "Canvas Sunsets Never Fade", a mystery based on nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, was written in 2000 and published in 2004. His second novel "Tranquility Denied" is set in post-Cold War Moscow, Stockholm and New Orleans, and is the first in a series featuring hotshot maritime lawyer Jonathan Brooks. The book was launched in Russia and in the U.S. in late 2006. His publisher recently announced the release of two more Jonathan Brooks thrillers by 2013.
Today, Frieden continues his fiction writing with several novels and short stories in the pipeline, while also serving as Assistant General Counsel for a global publishing and information services company. For his novels, Frieden has spent much of the last ten years researching the most challenging conflicts of the Cold War, including the Tito–Stalin split, the French Indochina War, the Korean War, the Fall of Saigon, the United States intervention in Chile, the Invasion of Panama, CIA activities in Bolivia, and the August Coup in the former Soviet Union. He’s also extensively researched key events in the changing post-Cold War era, such as the sinking of the K-141 Kursk, the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and the 2011 Libyan civil war. He has conducted extensive on-site research, including interviewing key political figures, in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Bulgaria, Poland, Serbia, Turkey, Uruguay, and Venezuela for background information for his upcoming political/espionage thrillers set in Latin America and Central Europe. His research also led him to witness the 2009 Honduran coup d'état firsthand and to interview former combatants in Nicaragua. Frieden also visited China and Vietnam for research on another political thriller and recently published a photography book capturing his journey through North Korea, including Pyongyang, Kaesong and the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In addition, his non-fiction works have appeared in numerous legal, technology and international business publications, including the National Law Journal, BNA International books and journals, and various CLE law books, though his literary passion continues to be mysteries and thrillers.

Narnia (band)

Narnia is a Christian neo-classical progressive power metal band founded by guitarist Carl Johan Grimmark and singer Christian Liljegren. The band formed in Sweden in 1996, disbanded in 2010, and reformed in 2014. Their album themes heavily reference "The Chronicles of Narnia" by C. S. Lewis.
History.
Liljegren and Grimmark met for the first time in 1993 in Jönköping, a town in the south of Sweden. At this time Liljegren and his band Modest Attraction were just about to release their first album, "The Truth in Your Face". Grimmark was a member of a band named Sentinel. They remained in contact over several years, during which both had trouble with their bands. Modest Attraction produced its second album "Divine Luxury" in 1996, at the same time as Grimmark decided to leave Sentinel. Liljegren phoned Grimmark and asked him whether he was interested in working together on a project. Liljegren had a passion for melodic hard rock, which he was not able to explore in the band Modest Attraction. Grimmark was instantly interested in a project along those lines.
A few months later Liljegren called Grimmark again and told him that Modest Attraction would go on tour to Germany and the guitar player Stephan Mohlin could not accompany them. Thus Grimmark replaced Stephan. Stephan soon left the band all together, and Grimmark was asked whether he would like to become a full-time band member. Grimmark accepted, thus giving Liljegren and Grimmark time to plan their project. They took a few old songs from other bands and altered them to their own preferences. In September 1996 they went into the Top Recording Studio. Grimmark played all of the instruments and Liljegren sang. The recordings took several months. They had several guests on the album, including Jakob Persson, who later played bass in Narnia. Janne Stark (Overdrive, Locomotive Breath, Baltimoore) was responsible for a guitar solos and Mart Hallek played the violin.
In January 1997, the recordings was finally finished. After hard work the album "Awakening" was mixed.
Thanks to their manager Magnus Söderkvist their album was taken up by ten Japanese labels. Nine of these labels wanted to take Narnia under contract, finally Narnia decided for Pony Canyon. In May, Liljegren and Grimmark went on their last tour with Modest Attraction. They met Matthias Mittelstädt, who possessed an enterprise named MCM Music. Mittelstädt, along with his brother, Rainer Matthias, loved the album and Mittelstädt became their manager.
With a demo in hand and new management, they began to search for talented new members and finally Narnia was born.
Subsequently the group signed with Nuclear Blast Records, and would release the albums "Long Live the King" (1999), "Desert Land" (2001), and "The Great Fall" (2003) on that label. They opened once for Stratovarius during this time.
A live-DVD and live album was released of their concert in Germany, both titled "At Short Notice... Live in Germany" (2006). The following album, "Enter the Gate" (2006), was released on MCM Music, as was the compilation album "Decade of Confession" (2007).
On April 9, 2008, Narnia began recording their latest album. On April 29, Liljegren announced his departure from the band. On August 29, the band announced on their official MySpace that the new vocalist is Germán Pascual. Germán grew up in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, but moved to Sweden in his teens. Previously he has worked with various bands and artists, such as Minds Eye and Mendez. Course of a Generation was released in Europe by Massacre Records on July 24, 2009.
On April 15, 2010 the band announced that they would be breaking up. On October 20, 2010 they announced that they would hold two final concerts - one in Germany, and one in Mexico. Original keyboardist Martin Claesson rejoined for the final two concerts.
Post-breakup and reunion.
Since their farewell shows in Mexico City, (at Revolution Metal), and Germany, (at Christmas Rocknight), there has not been a great deal of information about the members of Narnia. That changed on January 22, 2012, as former frontman Carl Johan Grimmark took to the band's official MySpace and revealed that he had been quite busy in the past year. 
According to Grimmark, he had joined the band Jerusalem during the summer of 2011, playing guitar and keyboard. He also stated that he was also involved with the band Full Force, composed of Mike Andersson, vocals (of Cloudscape), Anders Johansson (of Hammerfall, formerly of Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force) Stefan Elmgren (formerly of Hammerfall) and Tommy Larsson (formerly of Heed). He hinted at something big taking place in the future, but has since remained tight-lipped regarding the news.
On January 31, 2014, the band announced they were active again, celebrating the 15th anniversary of their "Long Live the King" album by playing live shows and re-releasing the album as a deluxe edition.

Lorenzo Álvarez Florentín

Lorenzo Álvarez Florentín (born August 10, 1926) is a Paraguayan composer and violinist.
He is known for compositions such as "Soul and Violin", "Night Whistle", "Go Albirroja Go" - the most popular song dedicated to the Paraguayan football team - and several symphonic poems. In addition to his musical career, he took a Bachelor's degree in journalism at the National University of Asunción. He has now been playing the violin professionally for about seventy years.
His parents were Turiano Álvarez and Ramona Florentín.
Childhood and Youth.
His musical bent was evident to his parents at an early stage, since at the age of 8 he had already made himself a violin and taught himself to play it.
The young Lorenzo soon decided that he wanted to become a musician, as music was a passion for him and he was aware of his talent for the violin. At the age of 11 he moved to the departmental capital, Encarnación, to begin his musical studies in a culturally important centre under teachers who would help him to improve himself.
It was the Molinas brothers who gave him the first impulse in the field of musical studies. He made his debut as a musician as a member of their band.
Career.
He stayed for more than a decade in the region where he was born, and then in 1950 he moved to Asunción to try for success there, offering his talent as a violinist in any band that needed his skills while he was completing his higher-level studies with the most recognized and renowned teachers.
In 1952, Leonardo Alarcón formed a big band that bore his name and invited Lorenzo to be one of its members. Alarcón was a musician and composer, trumpeter in the Band of Police Musicians of the capital, and a former pupil of Salvador Déntice. From then on the young Lorenzo Álvarez had the opportunity to work professionally with true musical artists.
After staying for a year in Alarcón's ensemble, Álvarez took an important step in his career when the renowned composer and conductor Florentín Giménez invited him to be first violin in his "Traditional and Modern" group, which in the mid-fifties had a reputation hard to match. Its 14 members included well-known figures such as Oscar Escobar, Carlos Centurion, Juan Carlos Miranda, and Jorge Alonso, and the group performed at the most important social events throughout Paraguay.
His priorities for continuing his musical education included improvements in his violin playing and studies of theory and sight-reading. He studied under Alfredo Kamprad at the Normal School of Music, where in 1955 he was appointed senior teacher of violin. He studied theory and sight-reading with Rodolfo Bagnati and harmony with Juan Carlos Moreno González, and a year later he completed his training studying composition with Florentín Giménez. In 1959 he won first prize in a composition contest organized by the Municipality of Asunción.
In the early 1960s Álvarez started the "International Rhythm Band", refreshing the Paraguayan dance repertoire with selections of polkas and foreign hits over more than a decade.
New directions.
For several decades he concentrated on violin performance, joining well-known bands and later directing bands of his own. Then in 1970 he reduced his professional playing in order to deepen his violin studies and expand his knowledge of harmony and composition. He remained as a performer in the Symphony Orchestra of the City of Asunción (OSCA), of which he had been a member since its beginning in 1957, and stayed on until his retirement in 1992.
His works.
Among his most famous works are: "Soul and Violin", a joyful piece whose interpretation requires great skill in violin performance, "Night Whistle", "Sweet Melody", "Cirilo R. Zayas”, and most of all the march "La Albirroja" composed with Ángel Peralta Arellano. Other works by him include "Madrecita Mía", "Che haitéma lo mitâ", "Purahéi", "Gustaví", "Mirtha Elizabeth", "Luisito", "Maria Victoria" and "Gladys Sunilda", all with Rudi Torga, dedicated to his children, in addition to the symphonic poems: "Jasy Retâ", "Sailor on the High Seas", "Malecón del Puerto", "Journey to the Horizon", among others.
At the age of 78 he was still very active musically: at that time he was conducting the José Asunción Flores folk orchestra at the National Conservatory of Music. In this institution he was teaching the violin, and also giving special performances, either with his son Luís, with Juan Cancio Barreto or with Berta Rojas.

Maddalena Allegranti

Maddalena Allegranti (1754 – 1829) was a pupil of Holtzbauer of Mannheim, and appeared for the first time at Venice in 1771. After singing at other theatres in Italy, she went in 1774 to Germany, where she continued to perform at Mannheim and Ratisbon till the year 1779, when she returned to Venice. She sang there at the theatre of San Samuele during the Carnival, and eventually came to England in 1781. Here she was enthusiastically admired in her first opera, "Viaggiatori felici" by Pasquale Anfossi.
Her voice, though thin, was extremely sweet, of extraordinary compass upwards, and so flexible as to lead her to indulge in a flowery style of singing which had then the merit of considerable novelty. She was also a good actress. But it was soon found that there was a great sameness in her manner and embellishments, and she became gradually so disregarded, by the end of her second season, that she went to Dresden,
where the Elector engaged her at a salary of a thousand ducats. She came a second time to London, many years later, and reappeared in Cimarosa's "Il matrimonio segreto". Never was a more pitiable attempt; she had scarcely a thread of voice remaining nor the power to sing
a note in tune: her figure and acting were equally altered for the worse, and after a few nights she was obliged to retire, and quit the stage for ever. She performed in oratorio in 1799.

Founder.
Edith Kinney Gaylord was born March 5, 1916 in Oklahoma City to parents Inez and E. K. Gaylord. Her father was editor and publisher of The Oklahoman and The Oklahoma City Times. Edith attended Colorado College in Colorado Springs before graduating from Wells College in Aurora, New York in spring of 1939 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.
Edith began her journalistic career reporting for her father’s newspaper and radio station in Oklahoma City. In the summer of 1942, she was hired by the Associated Press in New York and was transferred five months later to their Washington, D.C. bureau. She was the first female employee on the general news staff.
She filed stories from New York, Hollywood, San Francisco and Chicago while following Madam Chiang Kai-shek on her tour of America. When first lady Eleanor Roosevelt insisted the AP send a female reporter to cover her news conferences, Edith was assigned to the task.
In 1944, Edith was elected president of the National Women’s Press Club, and served as secretary of Mrs. Roosevelt’s press conference committee and media liaison between her and the press. She also covered other notable events, including the death of Franklin Roosevelt, the new first lady Bess Truman and the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London.
Edith returned to Oklahoma City and rejoined the family business in 1963, serving as a member of the board of directors and corporate secretary for The Oklahoma Publishing Company.
Edith quietly began her philanthropy efforts in the 1960s, often donating anonymously to those in need. In 1982 she founded both Inasmuch Foundation and Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation to carry out her giving. Robert J. Ross is the current President and CEO of the foundations. Edith became a charter trustee at Colorado College in Colorado Springs and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the college in 1992. The University of Oklahoma also presented Edith with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1997 for her contributions
Edith Kinney Gaylord died Jan. 28, 2001, at St. Anthony's Heart Hospital in Oklahoma City, the same hospital where she had been born 84 years earlier.

Nexopia

Nexopia.com is a Canadian social networking website created by Timo Ewalds. It was designed as a general interactive site for people aged 14 and up, but the age limit recently was lowered to 13. Users are able to create and design their own profiles, friends list, blogs, galleries, articles, and forums. Interaction is accomplished through an internal personal messaging system, and public user comments on profiles, blogs or through threads and posts on the forums. In November 2012, Nexopia was acquired by digital ad network Ideon Media.
History.
Nexopia evolved from the community site called Enternexus.com, a website built by Timo Ewalds. This initial beta site was limited to 70 members and eventually led to the current website, Nexopia.com. When Enternexus.com was relaunched as Nexopia.com, initial growth is reported as follows: 100 users joined within four days, and within 22 months the site grew to 225,000 users. For a brief period during that time, Nexopia.com maintained a level of growth of 10% or 3500 average new members per day. Other available statistics are for the month of January 2005, bandwidth was estimated at 8–10 terabytes.
In October 2010, the site had just under 1.5 million users and nearly 35 billion hits. As for January 2012, the site reports 1,636,990 users and 35,517,895,992 hits. That means a growth of roughly 140,000 users in just under 14 months, which is about half as many new users in half the amount of time as when the site started. In other words, the site is still growing by nearly the same amount of users per year as it was since its inception.
The website initially had problems using PayPal as a payment method for their premium service (Plus) reportedly due to their demographic and issues with stolen credit cards. It now uses Interac Online, a service that allows account holders at participating banks to make payments online through online banking.
The website has also been the target of hackers and has been targeted by Distributed Denial of Service or DDoS attacks at least twice in its early days.
Update.
Nexopia launched an update to its user profile pages, the largest revision since the site's launch in 2003. The redesign includes a streamlined layout, Ajax controls for messages, galleries, and profile editing, new profile skinning options, and image resizing. The update to the website has caused much controversy among users due to recent issues. Such as slow load times, profile pictures being deleted or not uploading, private messages not being sent, forms not working correctly, and people angry simply because the site design was different. Nexopia staff had recently set up a poll asking what users disliked most about the new Nexopia site design. After finding that the majority of users disliked the new profile picture slider the most, Nexopia staff decided to provide the option to switch between the classic profile picture viewer and the new improved profile picture slider.
Members.
Over 95% of its users are Canadian with over 1.4 million member accounts and over 500,000 active users and a hit count of over 33 billion. During peak hours the site sometimes reaches over 30,000 users and several thousand guests online.
No nudity, racism, violence or gore are allowed in any of the forums or profiles, although photos of drugs are accepted only to a certain degree, and that degree is only a small amount of marijuana and the use of pipes and bongs. Alcohol is also accepted. Any other controlled substance (heroin, cocaine, or any other classified "hard drug") is not allowed. All profile pictures are checked by specially appointed photo moderators before being allowed up on a user's page. Photos put on a user's profile are not checked, but there is a "report abuse" button where another user can report anything that is not to Nexopia code of conduct. Nexopia also takes a hard stance against copyright infringement, presumably in fear of litigation. Over the last few years Nexopia has come under fire from various hardline parent groups who blamed many of their children's problems on the website and tried to have it be shut down. This has resulted in a policy change and forced Nexopia to be more strict about what users post on the website.
In March 2007, four students from Sherwood Park, Alberta were expelled from school and twenty given suspensions in a case of cyberbullying. Students from the Elk Island school district used Nexopia to create profiles of their teachers in which classmates posted defamatory, silly, derogatory, and libellous information on the teachers' pages.
Criticism.
The website became a prime target for online predators. Since a user's profile can be completely open to the public, all the profile images and information are viewable. Users often post personal information like their address, mobile telephone number, family members, relationship status, and what school they attend.
Online spam has increased such as through "dummy" accounts which have created that send spam messages to users, linking them to websites containing pornographic materials or malicious information.
The Plus feature was recently introduced into the Mac's Convenience Stores. As convenient as it may seem, a lack of staff knowledge and availability has led to the Plus feature being pulled from Macs locations.
Users who do not follow the rules may get a simple ban from the website or have their account "frozen".
In March 2012, the website was found to be in violation of federal privacy laws, because it keeps personal information indefinitely. As of November 2012, Nexopia is working with the Privacy Commissioner to ensure regulatory compliance.
Forums.
The forums include many official Nexopia forums, some regarding the websites functionality, while others are themed towards topics such as music or transportation, and some, such as User Topics, Teens, and Attention Seekers are non-specific to topic.
Aside from official forums, Nexopia Plus users have the option of creating their own forums, which can be open to any user or be a private forum that only invited members can view.
The forums are watched by specially chosen Global Mods as well as the administrators of the website. They have the power to fully edit any forums that are created by plus users. They watch for posts containing nudity as well as any other post that is against Nexopia's terms of use.
Memberships.
Users with free accounts have access to standard features such as forum posting, private messaging, user profiles with comments, photo uploading, a user blog and an image gallery.
Users paying a subscription fee gain access to extra features such as advanced user search, forum creation, various customization options, increased photo uploads and image gallery capacity, online file storage, and the elimination of ads.

Buckingham railway station

Buckingham was a railway station which served Buckingham, the former county town of Buckinghamshire, England, between 1850 and 1966.
History.
Opening.
The first survey of the London and Birmingham Railway's main line to London plotted a course which ran through Buckingham where a large locomotive and carriage works would have been built. The route was however altered in the face of opposition from the Duke of Buckingham who feared for the future of the town, and the line took a new course through Wolverton, opening in 1838. It was to be a further twelve years before Buckingham was connected to the railway, this time on the initiative of the second Duke of Buckingham together with local landowner Sir Harry Verney who formed the Buckinghamshire Railway to construct a line between Banbury and Bletchley.
After three years of construction, the single track line opened to passengers on 1 May 1850. The line was initially worked by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) which laid on a service of four trains each way daily. At Buckingham, a temporary rudimentary wooden station fronting on to Lenborough Road was used which initially suffered from poor access, being situated almost in the middle of a field along a footpath. This was improved when, in 1853, the station was reached by Chandos Road. The Buckingham Corporation petitioned the railway company to construct a better station which it eventually did in 1861. Designed by J.W. Livock, the new station was constructed in a doric style with cornice moulding and pediment. A new road named "Station Road" was laid from Chandos Road to connect with Gawcott Road to allow passengers to reach the new booking office.
Early years.
A number of railway excursions were organised in the early years, taking passengers to destinations such as Crystal Palace via Euston. Initial regular services consisted of five daily trains each way on weekdays and one afternoon service on Sundays. Passengers could travel to London via Verney Junction and Bletchley in around 2.5 hours, the service then continuing on to Liverpool and Birmingham via Rugby. The completion of the new line south from Verney Junction to Aylesbury in 1868 opened up the possibility of further destinations.
In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died leaving no male issue meaning that the Dukedom of Buckingham and Chandos became extinct. The family seat at Stowe House was subsequently let to the Comte de Paris, the royalist pretender to the French throne. His residence at Stowe House led the railway company to install bilingual signage at the station as an aid to his staff. In 1898, W H Smith installed a book stall on the platform, this was subsequently replaced by a Wyman's stall when a change in contract resulted in Smith's moving their business to the town centre.
Milk trade was becoming an important source of railway income at the turn of the twentieth century, so much so that a creamery and milk processing factory was constructed opposite the station to handle the milk train traffic. The factory's owners changed names several times, being variously known as the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co., the Condensed and Peptonised Milk Co., Thew, Hook and Gilbey and then later as United Dairies.
In 1915, the LNWR made a number of economies to the line, one of which included the closure of the small signal box in the goods yard, 750 yards to the north of the station. The double-track section between the station and signal box - the only doubled section on the line - was severed at the station and a buffer stop installed on the down line. The up and down lines were then reconnected by slewing a section of track across.
Decline and closure.
Passenger traffic over the line was never particularly heavy, although it was a useful goods route. In the face of increased competition from buses and the private motor car in the 1920s and 1930s, passenger levels declined. By the late 1940s, Sunday passenger services were withdrawn and there were now only four services each way on weekdays. The line was also hit hard by the ASLEF strike of 1955 which saw much of the milk traffic lost to road. A form of reprieve came in 1956 when British Rail attempted to reduce losses by introducing lightweight single unit diesel cars (9 up and down daily) in 1956 between Banbury and Buckingham as part of the 1955 Modernisation Plan. Although this experiment was rewarded by an increase in traffic of over 400%, British Rail nevertheless claimed that the line was uneconomic. The section between Banbury and Buckingham closed on 2 January 1961, leaving Buckingham as the terminus for the branch passenger traffic.
Proposals to close the remainder of the line surfaced in September 1963 and a public hearing was held the following October. Passenger services were subsequently withdrawn as from 7 September 1964, leaving the line to Verney Junction open for freight. Woolworths opened a store in Buckingham in February 1964 and operated a policy of moving their goods by rail. The station's goods yard was soon full of vans carrying the company's merchandise. British Rail nonetheless announced the closure of the branch to Verney Junction as from 11 March 1966, with the line remaining open until 4 April for the purposes of a visit from the Queen. The station did eventually close in December 1966.
In its last full year of service, the line between Bletchley and Buckingham carried 6,600 passengers, with receipts of £4,000. This amount included 1,000 passengers travelling on Stowe School specials, who accounted for £1,250; the remaining 5,600 passengers brought in an income of £2,750, working out at two passengers per train. A Midland Red bus service provided a replacement service between local villages.
Present day.
The station buildings have been completely demolished, leaving only the platform edges which remain in a dilapidated state. The trackbed through Buckingham, infilled to platform level, has become a wooded walk.

François Delfau

François Delfau (born 1637 at Montel in Auvergne, France; died 13 October 1676, at Landevenec in Normandy) was a French Benedictine theologian, an authority on patristic theology.
Life.
He joined the Order of St. Benedict when he was seventeen years of age, and made his solemn profession at the Abbey of St. Allire, 2 May 1656. He was a student of the Fathers of the Church and the history of the councils. 
When the Congregation of St. Maur in 1670 determined to undertake a critical edition of the works of Augustine of Hippo, Delfau was commissioned by his superiors to prepare it. Together with six other members of the order, among them his intimate friend Dom Robert Guérard, he began the task. In 1671 he prepared an elaborate prospectus, setting forth the general scope and character of the new edition and the principles by which the editors were to be guided. 
Manuscripts came to the Maurists from various countries, and Pope Clement X sent them codices from the Vatican Library, together with all the materials that had been gathered there under Pope Clement VIII for a projected edition of the "Opera Augustini". When the first two volumes were about to be printed, the work was suddenly arrested, 18 Sept., 1675, by two lettres de cachet from Louis XIV, decreeing the banishment of both Delfau and Guérard from Paris. The occasion for this drastic measure seems to have been Delfau's book "L'abbé commendataire", published at Cologne, 1673, in which the young monk had commented on the abuses connected with the system of commendatory abbots as it was then in France. 
Delfau was obliged to withdraw to the monastery of Landevenec; he lived there but little more than a year when, at the early age of thirty-eight, he was drowned as he was crossing to the Carmelite convent at Brest, where he was to deliver a eulogy on the feast-day of St. Teresa.

Polly Shackleton

Polly Ehrlich Shackleton (c. 1910 – July 14, 1997) was a Democratic politician in Washington, D.C. She was elected as one of the original members of the Council of the District of Columbia in 1974 when D.C. gained home rule. She represented Ward 3 on the council from 1975 to 1987.
Early life and career.
Shackleton was born in Brookline, Massachusetts. Before moving to Washington, D.C. in 1939, she worked on Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidential campaign, giving her a first taste of politics. Her early career included being an editor for "Who's Who in American Art", as well as the "American Art Annual". During World War II, Shackleton worked as an information specialist and researcher for the Office of War Information. She also held a position at the American Institute of Architects from 1951 to 1962.
Political career.
Shackleton first participated in D.C. politics during the 1950s. When Adlai Stevenson ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1952, she was actively involved in his campaign. Once Stevenson received the nomination, she became a member of the Democratic Central Committee, as well as an alternate Democratic National Committeewoman. In 1956, her political involvement expanded when she became a delegate to the Democratic National Convention and served on the platform committee.
Eleven years later in 1967, President Johnson appointed Shackleton to the first D.C. City Council. When the District held its first elected Council in 1974, Shackleton received one of the seats. After being elected to additional terms in 1978 and 1982, she retired from public office in 1986. During her tenure on the Council, Shackleton served on various committees dedicated to health and welfare, citizen's rights, and childcare. She was well known for her social efforts for the poor, children, elderly, and infirm. Shackleton also advocated for District Home Rule and National Representation. When it came to issues surrounding transportation, she supported METRO legislation and the building of bicycle paths. In addition, she was an active supporter of Project Pride, a D.C. summer program involving youth who built community while beautifying various parts of the city. Her efforts in office aided in the passing of 60 pieces of legislation that later became D.C. law.

Bloody Mary (folklore)

Bloody Mary is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost or spirit conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is called multiple times. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. The Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation games.
Ritual.
Historically, the ritual encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards while holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see a skull (or the face of the Grim Reaper) instead, indicating that they were destined to die before they married.
In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups (usually teenagers) who ritualistically invoke her name, usually by repeatedly chanting her name in a mirror placed in a dimly lit room. The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, a witch or ghost; can be friendly or evil; and is sometimes "seen" covered in blood. The lore surrounding the ritual (if she is summoned properly) states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood, or scratching their eyes out.
A modern addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's tenuous connection to Queen Mary I, also known as "Bloody Mary", whose life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies.
Phenomenon explained.
Staring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room may eventually cause one to hallucinate. Facial features may appear to "melt" or disappear, and other hallucinations (such as faces) may appear. This phenomenon is believed to be a consequence of sensory deprivation—causing our brain's facial-recognition system to misfire. "Troxler's fading", self-hypnosis, and the "Caputo Effect" have been posited as explanations for the Bloody Mary phenomena.
In popular culture.
The legend of Bloody Mary has served as inspiration for a number of movies and television shows dealing with the supernatural.

Frontier Adventure Sports &amp; Training

Frontier Adventure Sports and Training (FAST) is the most establishedneeds citation Adventure Race organizer in Canada, in operation since 1997. Frontier Adventure Sports has established an international reputation for solid logistics and challenging racecourses. FAST hosts events under several banners: the Frontier Adventure Challenge, Raid the North and Raid the North Extreme. These non-stop races range in length from 8 hours to six days and require coed teams of three or four to hike, mountain bike, paddle and negotiate fixed ropes, while navigating an unmarked racecourse through the wilderness.
Adventure Racing.
Adventure Racing can be defined as a non-stop, multi-day, multi-discipline, team event. In many ways it can be likened to an expedition with a stopwatch. The goal of the competition is to be the first team to get all members across the finish line together. Adventure Racing requires teamwork, perseverance, and strong navigation and wilderness survival skills. The most common disciplines involved in an adventure race are mountain biking, hiking, paddling and rappelling. There are many different lengths and formats of events, ranging from off-road triathlons, to month long expeditions. The course should take competitors through remote wilderness where they must travel without outside assistance. Each team must use strategy to determine the best route, equipment, food and pace to maintain to win.
Raid the North.
Since 1997, Raid the North events have been designed to highlight the natural elements of the host region environment. The Raid the North Race Series consists of a national series of 36-hour races in various locations across Canada, during which teams will cover between 130 and 150 kilometers. A Raid the North Team is a co-ed group of four people with a variety of sport, outdoor and wilderness backgrounds. Unlike RTNX, Raid the North events are geared towards the prepared first time adventure racer.
Raid the North Extreme.
Raid the North Extreme (RTNX) is a 6-day expedition-style adventure race. It was held once per year from 1999 to 2004, and since then has been held every three years. Strong navigation skills and wilderness experience are required as the course covers roughly 500 kilometers of unmarked terrain. Each year the race travels to a different region in Canada that provides rugged wilderness challenges for competitors. 
Raid the North Extreme was one of the original founding members of the Adventure Racing World Series and a qualifier race for the AR World Championship. Raid the North Extreme was selected as the Adventure Racing World Championships in 2004. RTNX was included in the 2011 World Series. 
Raid the North Extreme is designed for experienced adventure racers, or those with significant wilderness experience, as there are significantly long sections of remote wilderness where rescue is difficult. Mixed gender teams of four have up to 6 days (non-stop) to cover 450 kilometres by trekking, mountain biking, paddling, and mountaineering. Competitors must navigate their own route through checkpoints throughout the racecourse. It is the only expedition-style event longer than 48 hrs in Canada.
Raid the North Extreme competitors come from across Canada and the United States and tend to have a broad multi-sport experience and/or extensive outdoor skills. International race competitors have come from Mexico, Argentina, Spain, France, Finland, New Zealand and Singapore.
Raid the North Extreme has previously been hosted by Elliot Lake, ON in 1999, Revelstoke, BC in 2000, Newfoundland & Labrador in 2001, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory in 2002, Atikokan, ON in 2003, Newfoundland & Labrador in 2004, Prince Rupert and Haida Gwaii, BC in 2007 and BC's West Kootenay in 2011.
Each race highlights the unique history, untouched wilderness and culture of the host region, including First Nations hunting and trading routes as well as other historic sites.
RTNX Locations & Top 5 Finishers.
2011: West Kootenay, BC
2007: Prince Rupert/Haida Gwaii, BC
2004: Corner Brook, NL (AR World Championships)
2003: Atikokan, ON
2002: Whitehorse, Yukon
2001: Corner Brook, NL
2000: Revelstoke, BC
1999: Elliot Lake, ON
Economic Impact.
Raid the North Extreme creates broad tourism promotion for each region it visits, via media coverage and word of mouth. Documentaries on the race have been aired on the Outdoor Life Network, TSN, the Global Television Network, and PBS. RTNX also has a significant economic impact on the host region, creating an estimated local boost of $2.3 million.
Camp Frontier.
Frontier Adventure Sports hosts an extensive adventure racing training curriculum focusing on the skills and knowledge required to compete in adventure racing. 
In partnership with Esprit Rafting, Frontier Adventure Sports offers the Jalcomulco AR Training Week as well as the Pico2Playa Expedition Training Week in Veracruz, Mexico.
The Pico2Playa Expedition Week consists of a staged expedition from Pico de Orizaba to the Gulf of Mexico.
History.
In 1997, Eco-Challenge competitor Dave Zietsma wanted to bring expedition racing to Canada, and introduced the 36 hour Raid the North race event. Originally known as Frontier Adventure Racing, the company grew to include the 6 day expedition race, Raid the North Extreme, and an 8 hour series, the Salomon Adventure Challenge. In 2002, Frontier was purchased by Geoff Langford, who introduced 14 hour Adventure Challenge events, restructured the company as Frontier Adventure Sports & Training, and created the Camp Frontier brand offering week-long training camps in Mexico and Costa Rica.
Since its inception, Frontier has hosted over 100 race events in Canada. Frontier is most recognized for its 2007 Raid the North Extreme event held in Haida Gwaii and Prince Rupert, BC, broadcast nationally on the Global Television Network in Canada and on PBS in the US.

Nikolay Zubov

Count Nikolay Alexandrovich Zubov (; 24 April 1763 - 9 August 1805) was the eldest of the Zubov brothers who, together with Count Pahlen, masterminded the conspiracy to assassinate Tsar Paul of Russia. 
In 1782 Zubov joined the Horse Guards regiment where he became known for his gigantic height, physical strength and fiery temper. When his younger brother Platon became Catherine II's lover, the "colossus" was made a count and general. He helped Alexander Suvorov fend off Prince Potemkin's intrigues, courted his only daughter, the "Suvorochka" (1775–1844), and eventually married her towards the end of 1794.
Although Catherine II's death spelled the end of his career, Nicholas mustered courage and rushed to the Gatchina Palace, where her son Paul was residing. He hoped to become the first to congratulate Paul on his prospective accession to the throne. On hearing the news of his arrival, Paul refused to see the courtier. He had heard the rumor that the Zubovs persuaded the Empress to sign a testament transferring the throne to her grandson Alexander and was afraid that Zubov had come to arrest him.
In short order, the Zubov brothers were exiled from court and little was heard about them until November 1800, when Nicholas was permitted to return to St. Petersburg. The connections of his sister Olga Zherebtsova and the funds provided by her lover Lord Whitworth allowed him and Count Pahlen to form a conspiracy. On the night of 11 March 1801 the plotters broke into Paul's bedroom in Saint Michael's Castle, and Zubov struck the emperor down with a heavy snuffbox, whereupon he was strangled by his accomplices. 
Zubov died four years after the regicide. Among his descendants was Count Valentin Platonovich Zubov (1884–1969) who founded the Gatchina museum and authored several books about Tsar Paul and his reign.

SMS language

SMS language or textese (also known as txt-speak, txtese, chatspeak, txt, txtspk, txtk, txto, texting language, txt lingo, SMSish, txtslang,or txt talk) is a term for the abbreviations and slang commonly used with mobile phone text messaging, but sometimes used with other Internet-based communication such as email and instant messaging.
Three features of early mobile phone messaging encouraged users to use abbreviations: (a) Text entry was difficult, requiring multiple key presses on a small keypad to generate each letter; (b) Messages were limited to 160 characters, and (c) it made texting faster.
Once it became popular it took on a life of its own and was often used outside of its original context. At its peak, it was the cause of vigorous debate about its potentially detrimental effect on literacy, but with the advent of alphabetic keyboards on smartphones its use, and the controversies surrounding it, have receded.
History.
SMS language is similar to that used by those sending telegraphs that charged by the word. It seeks to use the fewest number of letters to produce ultra-concise words and sentiments 
in dealing with space, time and cost constraints of text messaging. This follows from how early SMS permitted only 160 characters and some carriers charge messages by the number of characters sent.
It also shares some of these characteristics with Internet slang and Telex speak following from how its evolution is rather symbiotic to the evolution of use of shorthand in Internet chat rooms. Likewise, such a change sought to accommodate the small number of characters allowed per message, and to increase convenience for the time-consuming and often small keyboards on mobile phones. In addition, similarly elliptical styles of writing can be traced to the days of telegraphese 120 years back, where telegraph operators were reported to use abbreviations similar to those used in modern text when chatting amongst themselves in between sending of official messages.
Nevertheless, the invention of mobile phone messaging is considered to be the source for the invention of SMS language. In general, SMS language thus permits the sender to type less and communicate more quickly than one could without such shortcuts. One example is the use of "tomoz" instead of "tomorrow". Nevertheless, there are no standard rules for the creation and use of SMS languages. Any word may be shortened (for example, "text" to "txt"). Words can also be combined with numbers to make them shorter (for example, "later" to "l8r"), using the numeral "8" for its homophonic quality.
SMS language as a multilingual entity.
Some may view SMS language to be a nascent dialect of the English language, that is a dialect strongly if not completely derivative of the English language. This may not be so. Such generalization may have risen from the fact that mobile phones had only been able to support a limited number of default languages in the early stages of its conception and distribution.
A mobile operating system (OS) such as Symbian and language packs enable the linguistic localization of products that are equipped with such interfaces, where the current Symbian release (Symbian Belle) supports the scripts and orthographies of over 48 languages and dialects, though such provisions are by no means fully comprehensive as to the languages used by users all over the world. Researcher Mohammad Shirali-Shahreza (2007) further observes that mobile phone producers offer support "of local language of the country" within which their phone sets are to be distributed.
Nevertheless, various factors contribute as additional constraints to the use of non-English languages and scripts in SMS. This motivates the anglicization of such languages, especially those using non-Latin orthographies (i.e. not using Latin alphabets) following for instance, the even more limited message lengths involved when using for example, Cyrillic or Greek letters. On the flip side, researcher Gillian Perrett observes the de-anglicization of the English language following its use and incorporation into non-English linguistic contexts.
As such, on top of the measures taken to minimize space, time and cost constraints in SMS language, further constraints upon the varied nature and characteristics of languages worldwide add to the distinct properties and style of SMS language(s).
Linguistic properties and style.
The primary motivation for the creation and use of SMS language was to convey a comprehensible message using the fewest number of characters possible. This was due (i) to the way in which telecommunication companies limited the number of characters per SMS, and also charged the user per SMS sent. To keep costs down, users had to find a way of being concise while still getting their message across. Further (ii) typing on a phone is normally slower than with a keyboard, and capitalization is even slower. 
As a result, punctuation, grammar, and capitalization are largely ignored. In many countries, people now have access to unlimited text options in their monthly plan, although this varies widely from country to country, and operator to operator. However, screens are still small, which continues to motivate short messages and the input problem persists: SMS language is still widely used for brevity.
Observations and classifications as to the linguistic and stylistic properties of SMS language have been made and proposed by Crispin Thurlow, López Rúa and David Crystal among many others. Although they are by no means exhaustive, some of these marked properties involve the use of:
Initialisations (acronyms and abbreviations composed of initials).
There are many examples of words or phrases that share the same abbreviations (e.g., "lol" could mean "laugh out loud," "lots of love," or "little old lady," and "cryn" could mean "crayon" or "cryin(g)").
Reductions and shortenings, and omission of parts of speech.
For words that have no common abbreviation, users most commonly remove the vowels from a word, and the reader is required to interpret a string of consonants by re-adding the vowels (e.g. "dictionary" becomes "dctnry" and "keyboard" becomes "kybrd"). Omission of words, especially function words (e.g.: determiners like "a" and "the") are also employed as part of the effort to overcome time and space constraints.
The advent of predictive text input and smartphones featuring full QWERTY keyboards may contribute to a reduction in the use of shortenings in SMS language, although this has not yet been noted.
Pragmatics and context in interpretation of ambiguous shortenings.
Recipients may have to interpret the abbreviated words depending on the context in which they are being used. For instance, should someone use "ttyl, lol" they may probably mean "talk to you later, lots of love" as opposed to "talk to you later, laugh out loud". In another instance, if someone were to use "omg, lol" they may perhaps mean "oh my god, laugh out loud" as opposed to "oh my god, lots of love".
Therefore, co-textual references and context are crucial when interpreting textese, and it is precisely this shortfall that critics cite as a reason not to use it (although the English language in general, like many other languages, has many words that have different meanings in different contexts).
SMS language does not always obey or follow standard grammar, and additionally the words used are not usually found in standard dictionaries or recognized by language academies.
Reactive tokens.
The feature of 'reactive tokens' that is ubiquitous in Internet Relay Chat (IRC), is also commonly found in SMS language. Reactive tokens include phrases or words like ‘yeah I know’, which signifies a reaction to a previous message. In SMS language, however, the difference is that many words are shortened unlike in spoken speech.
Pictograms and logograms (rebus abbreviation).
Some tokens of the SMS language can be likened to a rebus, using pictures and single letters or numbers to represent whole words (e.g. "i <3 u which uses the pictogram of a heart for "love", and the letter "u" replaces "you").
The dialect has a few hieroglyphs (codes comprehensible to initiates) and a range of face symbols.
Paralinguistic and prosodic features.
Prosodic features in SMS language aim to provide added semantic and syntactic information and context from which recipients can use to deduce a more contextually relevant and accurate interpretation. These may aim to convey the textual equivalent of verbal prosodic features such as facial expression and tone of voice Indeed, even though SMS language exists in the format of written text, it closely resembles normal speech in that it does not have a complicated structure and that its meaning is greatly contextualised.
Capitalization.
In the case of capitalization in SMS language, there are three scenarios:
SMS messages with:
Most SMS messages have done away with capitalization. Use of capitalizations on the first word of a message may in fact, not be intentional, and may likely be due to the default capitalization setting of devices.
Capitalization too may encode prosodic elements, where copious use may signify the textual equivalent of raised voice to indicate heightened emotion.
Asterisk emoting and emoticons.
Just as body language and facial expressions can alter how speech is perceived, emoticons can alter the meaning of a text message, the difference being that the real tone of the SMS sender is less easily discerned merely by the emoticon. Using a smiling face can be perceived as being sarcastic rather than happy, thus the reader has to decide which it is by looking at the whole message.
Use of punctuation and capitalization to form emoticons distracts from the more traditional function of such features and symbols. Nevertheless, uses do differ across individuals and cultures. For example, overpunctuation may simply be used to communicate paralinguistic aspects of communication without the need to create an emotion from it like so: "Hello!!!!".
Punctuation, or lack thereof.
While vowels and punctuation of words in SMS language are generally omitted, David Crystal observes that apostrophes occur unusually frequently. He cites an American study of 544 messages, where occurrence of apostrophes in SMS language is approximately 35 percent. This is unexpected, seeing that it is a hassle to input an apostrophe in a text message with the multiple steps involved. Interestingly, the use of apostrophes cannot be totally attributed to users attempting to disambiguate words that might otherwise be misunderstood without it.
There are not that many cases in English where leaving out the apostrophe causes misunderstanding of the message. For example, "we’re" without the apostrophe could be misread as "were". Even so, these are mostly understood correctly despite being ambiguous, as readers can rely on other cues such as part of sentence and context where the word appears to decide what the word should be. For many other words like "Im" and "Shes", there is no ambiguity. Since it is not imperative that users use apostrophes to ensure that their message is understood accurately, this phenomenon may in part be attributed to texters wanting to maintain clarity so that the message can be more easily understood in a shorter amount of time.
Variations in spelling.
Users may also use spellings that reflect their illocutionary force and intention rather than using the standard spelling. For example, the use of "haha" to signify "standard" laughter, and "muahaha" to encode perhaps more raucous or evil sound of laughter.
In this, regional variations in spelling can also be observed. As such, SMS language, with its intergroup variations, serves also as an identity marker.
Conventionalised examples and vocabulary.
SMS dictionaries.
SMS language has yet to be accepted as a conventional and stable form, dialect and language. As a result (as much as it is also a consequence), notable lexicographical efforts and publications (e.g. dictionaries) dealing specifically with SMS language have yet to emerge. This is perhaps with the exception of the SMS dictionary that the service provider Vodacom, provides its clients with as a supplement to their cellphone purchase. However, as a result text message slang has aided many children's language. By constantly using this ungrammatical form of texting so frequently, it has become apart of their "normal language". 
A mini SMS dictionary/glossary by Vodacom
Vodacom also provides other lists of abbreviations and acronyms with their meanings in its website.
On the Internet, however, there has been effort to provide dictionaries of sorts for SMS language. Such websites usually have an alphabetical list of 'words' used in SMS language, together with their intended meanings. Text messages can also be 'translated' to standard language on certain websites as well, though the 'translations' are not always accurate.
Overall observations and criticisms.
Frequency of use.
In one American study, researchers found that less than 20% of messages used SMS language. Looking at his own texting history, the study's author, linguist David Crystal, noted just 10% of his messages used SMS language.
General effects on society.
In SMS language, the original letters in words are typically replaced by phonetically similar letters or numbers. The word "to" is commonly replaced by "2" and the word "see" by the letter "c". As the trend of SMS language evolves and seeps into the daily lives of individuals and some parents are even giving their babies alternative spellings for names in a bid to be unique.
Positive.
Effect on verbal language use and literacy.
According to research done by Dr. Nenagh Kemp of University of Tasmania, the evolution of "textese" is inherently coupled to a strong grasp of grammar and phonetics.
David Crystal has countered the claims that SMS has a deleterious effect on language with numerous scholarly studies. The findings are summarized in his book "".
In his book, Crystal argues that: 
He further observes that this is by no means a cause for bad spelling, where in fact, texting may lead to an improvement in the literacy of the user.
There are others who feel that the claims of SMS language being detrimental to English language proficiency are overrated. A study of the written work of 100 students by Freudenberg found that the actual amount of use of SMS language found in the written work was not very significant. Some features of SMS language such as the use of emoticons was not observed in any of the written work by the students. Of all the errors found, quite a substantial amount cannot be attributed to use of SMS language. These included errors that have already appeared even before the advent of SMS language.
There are also views that SMS language has little or no effect on grammar. Proponents of this view feel that that SMS language is merely another language, and since learning a new language does not affect students' proficiency in English grammar, it cannot be said that SMS language can affect their grammar. With proper instruction, students should be able to distinguish between slang, SMS language and correct English and use them in their appropriate contexts.
Efficiency and economy.
According to a study, though SMS language is faster to write, more time is needed to read it compared to conventional English.
Negative.
Effect on verbal language use and communication.
Although various other research supports the use of SMS language, the popular notion that text messaging is damaging to the linguistic development of young people persists and many view it as a corruption of the standard form of language.
Welsh journalist and television reporter John Humphrys has criticized SMS language as "wrecking our language". The author cites ambiguity as one problem posed, illustrating with examples such as "lol", which may either be interpreted to mean "laughing out loud", "lots of love", and "little old lady" depending on the context in which it is being used. However, it should be noted that ambiguous words and statements have always been present within languages. In English for example, the word "duck" can have more than one meaning. It could be referring to either the bird or the action, and such words are usually disambiguated by looking at the context in which it was written.
The proliferation of SMS language has been criticized for causing the deterioration of English language proficiency and its rich heritage. Opponents of SMS language feel that it undermines the properties of the English language that have lasted throughout its long history. Furthermore, words within the SMS language that are very similar to their English-language counterparts can be confused by young users as the actual English spelling and can therefore increase the prevalence of spelling mistakes.
Indolence vs. efficiency.
Humphrys describes emoticons and textese as "irritating" and essentially lazy behavior, and surmises that "sloppy" habits gained while using textese will result in students' growing ignorance of proper grammar and punctuation.
Use in school work, assignments and exams.
Use of SMS language in schools tended to be seen as negative effects. There have been some reports in the media of children using SMS language for essays in school. For example:
However, SMS language can potentially be a useful teaching tool as it could pique students' interest in certain topics. If the topic of the lesson was about mobile phones or forms of communication, teachers could talk about SMS language to help engage their students during class. There exist websites that provide interesting worksheets on SMS language, like http://busyteacher.org.
SMS language and identity.
According to Sean Ó Cadhain, abbreviations and acronyms elicits a sense of group identity as users must be familiar with the lingo of their group to be able to comprehend the SMS language used within the group. The ability to use and understand these language short forms that are unique to each group indicates that an individual is part of the group, forging a group identity that excludes outsiders. SMS language is thus thought to be the "secret code of the youth" by some. The fact that sometimes, shortened forms are used for reasons other than space constraints can be seen as interlocutors trying to establish solidarity with each other.
Differences between male and female use of SMS language.
According to Norwegian researcher Richard Ling, there are differences in the SMS language of females and males. The lexical, morphological and syntactic choices between males and females SMS users suggested to Ling that women are more "adroit" and more "literary" texters. 
Richard Ling observes:
Use in advertisements.
In recent years, advertisements have been increasingly influenced by SMS language. The longer the message in the advertisement, the less impression it will leave. Hence, short messages that are more catchy, cost and space saving are more commonly used. The visual effect elicited by SMS language also lends a feeling of novelty that helps to make the advertisement more memorable. For example, an advertisement of a book uses the SMS language: "EAT RIGHT 4 YOUR TYPE".
Companies focusing on the teen market have the tendency to make use of SMS language in their advertising to capture the attention of their target audience. Since teenagers tend to be the ones using SMS language, they are able to relate to advertisements that use SMS language. 
Unilever's advertisement for their novel range of deodorant for teenage girls uses the phrase "OMG! Moments." David Lang, president of the team who created the advertisement commented that they desired to bring across the impression that they identify with youth culture and discourse.
Many other companies like McDonald's have also attempted to pursue the teenage market by using SMS language abbreviations in their commercials. McDonald's in Korea has an online video commercial which concludes with: "r u ready?".

Chanh muối

Chanh muối is a salted, pickled lime in Vietnamese cuisine. Its name comes from the Vietnamese words "chanh" (meaning "lime" or "lemon") and "muối" (meaning "salt"). To make the "chanh muối", many limes (often key limes) are packed tightly in salt in a glass container and placed in the sun until they are pickled. During the process, juices are drawn off the limes, which dissolves the salt and produces a pickling liquid which immerses the finished "chanh muối".
Serving method.
"Chanh muối" are used to make a drink (with added sugar and water or carbonated water) that is also called "chanh muối" (or "soda chanh muối" if made with carbonated water), and which often appears on the menus of Vietnamese restaurants translated as "salty lemonade" or "salty limeade." To prepare the drink, a small piece of "chanh muối" (containing both rind and flesh) is cut, placed in a glass, and crushed slightly with a spoon or other utensil to release its juices, then the other ingredients are added.
Although the drink is typically served cold, with ice, as a refreshing summer drink, it may also be served hot, and is believed to be a remedy for the common cold. After finishing the drink, many Vietnamese people enjoy eating the piece of "chanh muối" left in the glass.
Outside Vietnam, lemons are sometimes used instead of limes to make "chanh muối".
The first commercial brand was created by Dan Vo, sold in bottles and bags through Southeast Asia.

Teachstreet

TeachStreet, Inc. was a web site providing information to students on local and online classes and teachers including pricing information, location, and teacher background and training. It also provided online business management tools for teachers and schools. The site was free to students and included student reviews and teacher recommendations.
History.
TeachStreet launched its web site in Seattle on April 20, 2008, Portland on August 4, 2008, the San Francisco Bay Area on November 19, 2008 and was launched in 8 US Metros, with new listings being added in cities nationwide on a daily basis.
TeachStreet founder Dave Schappell was previously a VP of Marketing at JibJab and a Director of Product Management at Amazon.com. The company received $2.25 million in early stage funding from Madrona Venture Group, Bezos Expeditions and various individual investors. Initially, the Teachstreet web site was free to both students and teachers. The site moved to a paying service for teachers' listings in April 2010, with various levels of pricing plans available. However, the site remained free for students. 
In February 2011, the launch of Google Panda (a change to Google's search results ranking algorithm) seriously affected traffic to the company's web site, and it never fully recovered. A year later, Teachstreet was bought by Amazon.com as a "talent acquisition" with its former employees transferring to AmazonLocal. Teachstreet.com closed down on 15 February 2012.

Verizon Communications

Verizon Communications (, ), branded as Verizon (pronounced ), is an American broadband and telecommunications company and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company is based in New York City at 1095 Avenue of the Americas.
What eventually became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the seven Baby Bells that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States. Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).
As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. In addition, Bell Atlantic moved their headquarters from Philadelphia into the old NYNEX headquarters and rebranded the entire company as Bell Atlantic. 
In 2000 Bell Atlantic merged with GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. The combined company elected to change its name to "Verizon", a portmanteau of "veritas" (Latin for "truth") and "horizon". The company's headquarters, while always having been located in New York City, were originally at 1095 Avenue of the Americas until the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger, when its headquarters were moved Verizon Building at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan before returning to the 1095 space in 2013.
History.
AT&T breakup and NYNEX acquisition.
Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic Corporation as one of the "Baby Bells" that were formed as a result of the anti-trust judgment against the American Telephone & Telegraph Company. Bell Atlantic then inherited seven of the Bell Operating Companies from AT&T (later known as AT&T Corporation) following its breakup. Bell Atlantic's original roster of operating companies included:
Bell Atlantic originally operated in the US states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as Washington, D.C.
In 1994, Bell Atlantic became the first Regional Bell Operating Company to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies. Operating company titles were simplified to "Bell Atlantic – "state name"".
In 1996, CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic's merger with NYNEX CEO Ivan G. Seidenberg. When it merged, it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City where CEO's Smith and Seidenberg shared Co-CEO duties. NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997.
Prior to its merger with GTE, Bell Atlantic traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the "BEL" symbol.
Verizon Wireless formation and GTE merger.
On September 21, 1999, Bell Atlantic and UK-based Vodafone AirTouch Plc (now Vodafone Group Plc) announced that they had agreed to create a new wireless business with a national footprint, a single brand and a common digital technology – composed of Bell Atlantic's and Vodafone's U.S. wireless assets (Bell Atlantic Mobile (which was previously called "Bell Atlantic-NYNEX Mobile" by 1997), AirTouch Cellular, PrimeCo Personal Communications, and AirTouch Paging). This wireless joint venture received regulatory approval in six months, and began operations as Verizon Wireless on April 4, 2000, kicking off the new "Verizon" brand name.
Bell Atlantic merged with GTE on June 30, 2000 and changed its name to Verizon Communications Inc. It was among the largest mergers in United States business history. It was the result of a definitive merger agreement, dated July 27, 1998, between Bell Atlantic, based in New York City since the merger with NYNEX in 1996, and GTE, which was in the process of moving its headquarters from Stamford, Connecticut, to Irving, Texas.
The Bell Atlantic–GTE merger, priced at more than $52 billion at the time of the announcement, closed nearly two years later, following analysis and approvals by Bell Atlantic and GTE shareowners, 27 state regulatory commissions and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and clearance from the United States Department of Justice and various international agencies.
The merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, to form Verizon Communications, became effective on June 30, 2000. Verizon began trading on the NYSE under its new "VZ" symbol on Monday, July 3, 2000. GTE's wireless operations became part of Verizon Wireless – creating what was initially the nation's largest wireless company before Cingular Wireless acquired AT&T Wireless in 2004 – when the Bell Atlantic–GTE merger closed nearly three months later. Verizon then became the majority owner (55%) of Verizon Wireless.
Bell Atlantic's CEO Ivan Seidenberg and GTE's Charles Lee were co-CEO's from 2000 to 2002 when Seidenberg became sole CEO, a position he held until July 2011 when he was succeeded by Lowell McAdam.
Verizon shares were made a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on April 8, 2004. In 2013 Verizon reported 21.8 million land lines in service. With the MCI merger, it has more than 250,000 employees. Verizon serves customers throughout much of the United States.
In late 2004, Verizon sold its 20.5% stake in Telus, a Canadian telecom. This was so that they could focus more on its own services. The stake came from GTE, which held stocks in BCTel, a Telus predecessor.
MCI acquisition.
On February 14, 2005, Verizon agreed to acquire MCI Inc., formerly WorldCom, after fellow "Baby Bell" SBC Communications agreed to acquire former parent AT&T Corporation just a few weeks earlier. (That combined company took the AT&T name.)
Media coverage has focused on several ways in which that acquisition, once completed, would benefit Verizon, including economies of scale derived from a potential productivity boost to be achieved via the elimination of thousands of jobs at the combined company, and access to the large base of business customers currently served by MCI. The real benefit to Verizon was the acquisition of long-haul lines. The bulk of Verizon's business is concentrated in the eastern United States. This not only renders the company, effectively, a regional phone company, but also forced it to pay usage fees to long-haul carriers, such as the former MCI and AT&T, to complete calls for its customers whenever those calls go outside the Verizon "footprint". That need is obviated by the MCI acquisition and was key in the long term market position strategy. By January 6, 2006, MCI was incorporated into Verizon with the name Verizon Business.
Verizon, with MCI, was the largest telecommunications company in the United States based on sales of $75.11 billion, profits of $7.4 billion and assets of $168.13 billion. After its acquisition of BellSouth, AT&T became the largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of assets and profits.
Alliances.
In July 2008 the major phone companies, including Verizon, formed Movearoo.com. The website is designed to help customers with the process of moving by finding the home service providers available in their area.
Divestitures.
Due to the rigorous climate and high costs, GTE Alaska was sold to Alaska Power and Telephone Company rather than be included in the Verizon merger.
In 2002, Verizon sold GTE's former telephone operations in 3 states: Missouri and Alabama operations were sold to CenturyTel, which acquired Embarq in 2009 and became CenturyLink, and Kentucky operations were sold to Alltel, which later spun off its landline operations as Windstream. In 2005, Verizon sold off GTE's former telephone operations in Hawaii to The Carlyle Group, this operation is now known as Hawaiian Telcom.
On April 3, 2006 Verizon agreed to sell its stakes in Verizon Dominicana (operating in the Dominican Republic), CANTV of Venezuela, and Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Inc. (PRT) in Puerto Rico to Telmex and América Móvil for $3.7 billion.
On January 16, 2007, Verizon New England operations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont were spun off, and merged with FairPoint Communications, a deal which was finalized on April 1, 2008.
On May 13, 2009, Verizon announced it was selling all of Verizon's wireline assets in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin as well as some assets in California to Frontier Communications. These assets include Contel of the South, Verizon North, Verizon Northwest, Verizon West Coast, Verizon West Virginia, and two new companies created for spinoff, New Communications of the Carolinas and New Communications of the Southwest. On July 1, 2010, the transfer of these assets to Frontier took place.
Directory operations.
The former Yellow Pages business of Verizon is known as SuperPages, and is a Texas-based sales, publishing and related service with 1,200 directory titles and a circulation of about 121 million copies in 41 states. The web site receives approximately 17 million visitors a month. It had an operating revenue of $3.6 billion in 2004 and employs 7,300 nationwide. In a move to leverage against higher traffic sites, SuperPages linked up with Google to provide search advertising services to its millions of listed businesses. SuperPages will offer its advertisers the ability to bid for Google search terms.
With an estimated $17 billion in assets, Verizon spun off the business unit to finance its expansion in wireless and high-speed Internet services. Verizon is not the first Baby Bell to rid itself of its directory publishing operations; Qwest sold off its QwestDex directory services to become Dex Media, and Illinois Bell, now known as AT&T, sold its directory operations to R.

Effects of changes in telephony.
The transition from land wire-based telephony to wireless communications has been a major change driver for all vendors in the telephony space, including Verizon. , the profitability of the company's "wireline" business had slipped substantially below that of its mobile division and continued to degrade, a situation reflected in and used to directly support downward revisions to "wireline" worker compensation, potentially impacting on the order of 45,000 workers in the United States.
Lines of Business.
Verizon Communications' operations are divided into three business units: wireless, residential and small business services, and enterprise services.
Wireless.
Verizon Wireless provides mobile phone, text message, and data services for phones, tablets, and computers, as well as wireless hotspot devices. As of September 2013, Verizon Wireless had 101.2 million wireless connections, and its 4G LTE network covered over 303 million people. In a September 2013 survey conducted by J.D. Power and Associates, Verizon Wireless was rated as having the highest network quality amongst national providers across all six geographic regions of the U.S., marking the first time any provider has come in first in all regions since the study switched to a regional format in 2004.
Also in September 2013, it was announced that Verizon would buy the remaining stake that Vodafone owned in Verizon Wireless, which had been a joint venture between the two companies, for $130 billion. Upon the closing of the deal in the first quarter of 2014, it will be the third largest corporate deal ever signed. Soon after the deal was announced, a shareholder sued Verizon, claiming that they overpaid for Vodafone's share of the venture.
Residential and small business.
Verizon provides wireline phone service, Internet access, and television to residences and small businesses, via either copper wire or fiber optic cable.
Verizon's FiOS service, launched in 2005, provides Internet, television, and phone service using fiber optic cable instead of copper wire. FiOS cable passes near 18 million homes, of which 14.6 million are completely ready for service; the other 3.4 million homes would require some additional wiring to support FiOS. As of September 2013, Verizon had a total of 5.9 million FiOS Internet subscribers and 5.2 million FiOS TV customers, with FiOS accounting for 75% of Verizon's revenues from fixed-line consumer retail. In September 2013, Verizon announced that FiOS TV subscribers would be able to watch some television channels live on their mobile devices.
In areas where Verizon has installed FiOS service, the copper wires, which are more expensive to maintain, are removed. This prevents a customer who has switched to FiOS from switching back to services provided by copper wires, such as DSL service.
Verizon operates landline services in 12 states (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, Texas, California) and Washington, D.C. through the following operating companies:
Enterprise.
Verizon Enterprise Solutions, known as Verizon Business from 2006 to 2011, provides services for wholesale, corporate, and government clients. Enterprise Solutions provides a cloud-based platform to deliver IT, security, mobility, and collaboration solutions to customers. It supports service in 75 countries, and has a global IP network that reaches more than 150 countries, with 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies using Verizon Enterprise Solutions.
In October 2013, Verizon announced Verizon Cloud, a platform as a service offering that allows for the fast deployment of virtual machines for customers, as well as control of the configuration of those virtual machines.
Verizon Partner Program.
On February 28, 2013, Verizon launched the Verizon Partner Program (VPP), which offers medium-sized preferred access to its businesses' cloud, mobility, communications, and networking solutions. There are four levels to VPP membership: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Member. Each offers a different level of benefits and requirements. VPP also offers three business models: Agent, Resale, and Sell With. Each represents a different relationship with Verizon. Some Partner Program companies include General Datatech, SOVA, and OEM Data Delivery.
Controversies.
Verizon Communications has been involved in several public controversies.
Tax dodging and lobbying.
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Verizon for spending $52.34 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $951 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $32.5 billion, having laid off 21,308 workers since 2008 and increasing executive pay by 167% to $20.3 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives. However, on February 24, 2012, in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC, Verizon reported having paid more than $11.1 billion in taxes (including income, employment and property taxes) in 2009–2011. In addition, the company reported in the 10-K that most of the drop in employment since 2008 was due to a voluntary retirement offer.
Political.
On December 22, 2004, mail servers at Verizon.net were configured not to accept connections from Europe, by default, in an attempt to reduce spam email. Individual domains would only be unblocked upon request.
On May 11, 2006, controversy arose when "USA Today" revealed that Verizon, along with AT&T Inc. and BellSouth, had turned over the call records of millions of U.S. citizens to the National Security Agency. Verizon flatly denied turning over records to the government, but did not comment on whether MCI, which it had acquired in January, had done so. But on October 12, 2007, the company admitted in a letter to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce that it had turned over customer information to the FBI and other federal agencies of the U.S. government approximately 94,000 times from January 2005 to September 2007, providing such information 720 times without being presented with a court order or warrant.
In September 2007, Verizon Wireless initially refused to make their mobile phone network available to NARAL Pro-Choice America for a program which allows people to sign up for pro-choice text messages, on the grounds that they had the right to block "controversial or unsavory" messages. They subsequently reversed the decision:
"It was an incorrect interpretation of a dusty internal policy, that ... was designed to ward against communications such as anonymous hate messaging and adult materials sent to children. ... has great respect for this free flow of ideas."
Internet.
On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. 4chan administrators found that only traffic on port 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected, leading them to believe that the block was intentional. On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan.org was "explicitly blocked" after Verizon's security and external experts detected sweep attacks coming from an IP address associated with the 4chan network. Traffic was restored several days later.
In August 2010, the chairmen of Verizon and Google agreed that Network Neutrality should be defined and limited.
In December 2010 Verizon continued censoring its network by blocking access to some IRC servers related to Wikileaks "Operation Payback".
E-911 Failures.
Verizon E-911 service in several northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. failed in the aftermath of the June 2012 derecho storm, with some problems lasting several days. The FCC conducted an investigation and in January 2013 released a report detailing the problems that led to the failure. Verizon reported that it had already addressed or was addressing a number of the issues related to the FCC report, including the causes of generator failures, conducting audits of backup systems, and making its monitoring systems less centralized, although the FCC indicated that Verizon still needed to make additional improvements.
FCC Ruling Appeal.
At the end of September 2011, Verizon Communication appealed the FCC’s ruling regarding net neutrality.
Copper-wire removal.
In areas where Verizon has installed FIOS service, the copper lines are disabled. A customer that has switched to FIOS no longer has the option to switch back to regular copper service. In addition, because the FCC does not require Verizon to allow competitors to use the fiber lines, a customer with FIOS service will have limited options with regards to switching service providers for voice and internet service.
NSA Collection of Phone Records.
On June 5, 2013, "The Guardian" reported that it had obtained an order by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and approved by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that required Verizon to provide the National Security Agency (NSA) with telephone metadata for all calls between the US and abroad, and all domestic calls. The order falls under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. The order was issued on April 15, 2013 and expires on July 19, 2013. There had previously been speculation that telecom providers were engaging in dragnet surveillance authorized by the PATRIOT Act. Government officials claim they are collecting "metadata" regarding phone serial numbers, times of calls, numbers called, and locations at which the calls were made—but not the content of the call itself. The officials claimed that such metadata would not require a warrant to collect.
In an interview with reporters on June 6, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is the chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senator Saxby Chambliss, who is the ranking member, have stated that the three month renewal has been the case for the past seven years.
On November 18, 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court denied without stating any reason a “writ of mandamus or prohibition” filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center seeking to vacate the FISC order requiring Verizon to turn over to the NSA telephone metadata for all calls between the US and abroad, and all domestic calls.
On January 23, 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon Communications Inc. received more than 1,000 requests for information about its subscribers on national security grounds last year which do not require approval from a judge or grand jury as long as the information is relevant to national security. In total Verizon received 321,545 requests from federal, state and local law enforcement for U.S. customer information.
On February 8, 2014 Fox News reported that Verizon and T-Mobile were not part of the bulk metadata collection of the NSA.

Symphony No. 1 (Schubert)

The Symphony No. 1 in D major, D. 82, was composed by Franz Schubert in 1813, when he was just 16 years old. Despite his youth, No. 1 is an impressive piece of orchestral music for both its time and size. The first movement opens with a stately Adagio introduction, reminiscent of the Haydn's 104 in its format. The short Adagio sets off a lively Allegro vivace.
The symphony is scored for 1 flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in D, 2 trumpets in D, timpani and strings. The orchestration, which is balanced between strings and winds, lends itself to small chamber orchestras, as well as larger ensembles. The trumpets are scored particularly high, as in many of Schubert's early works. Trumpet players will find, in general, the tessitura sitting between a concert D to Concert A for most of the 1st and 4th movements. In the 4th movement, Schubert pushes them up to a high D, in a repeated fashion. Some careful planning is needed to balance the multiple doublings between horns and trumpets. 
The standard four movement work runs about 26 minutes.

In Her Shoes (novel)

In Her Shoes (2002) is a work of Jewish American literature by Jennifer Weiner. It tells the story of two sisters and their estranged grandmother. The novel was a "New York Times" bestseller.
Plot summary.
Rose and Maggie Feller are two young sisters who share little in common except their shoe size. Rose is the eldest and has been watching after Maggie since they were young children and their mother Caroline died in a car accident. They were raised by their father Michael (perpetually in mourning for Caroline) and stepmother Sydelle (who resents them both). 
Rose is a thirty-year old single, successful lawyer who struggles with her weight, and who resents her younger sister's beauty and success with men. Maggie, a twenty-eight-year-old who uses her beauty and charming nature to hide the obstacles she faces due to dyslexia and related learning difficulties, resents Rose's academic success and consequent wealth. While close as children, standardized testing sets them on different paths in high school: Rose's success on the exams leads to Princeton University and University of Pennsylvania Law School; Maggie's failure on the exams leads to a future path of drifting through a string of clerical jobs until she ends up homeless and jobless on Rose's couch. Both nearing the age of their mother when she died, Rose and Maggie each feel as if there is a vacuum in their lives which they are unable to fill.
After wearing out her welcome with Rose (and being evicted from her father's home by her step mother), Maggie runs away, choosing to hide in Princeton University, which she had visited when Rose was a student. Finding shelter in a lower level of the library (with a fully equipped bathroom/shower), Maggie fills her free time doing something that she had avoided her entire life: reading. She also accepts a part-time position as a care-taker for a nearby elderly woman. Maggie is surprised to find that when reading in her own way at her own pace, she enjoys the activity and even begins to attend a poetry class. Eventually, however, a boy (whose wallet she had stolen) discovers her belongings in the library. Realizing her charade at Princeton is over, Maggie runs away. She travels to find her long-lost grandmother, whose old letters she had discovered previously in her father's desk. Rose, meanwhile, leaves her career in law in order to discover what life as a dog-walker would be like. She also begins to date Simon Stein.
Grandma Ella, who had previously tried to track the girls via the Internet (only finding information on Rose) is delighted to see Maggie and invites her to stay in her home. Gradually Maggie, Ella, and eventually Rose reconcile with each other, and in the process come to terms with both the life and death of Caroline.

18th Royal Garhwal Rifles

The 18th Royal Garhwal Rifles was an infantry regiment of the British Indian Army. It was formed in 1922, after the Indian government decided to reform the army moving away from single battalion regiments to multi battalion regiments. They were they only Indian Infantry regiment to remain intact without being amalgamated. They were renumbered 18th Royal Garhwal Rifles with three active battalions and the 4th battalion becoming the 10th training battalion. After the partition of India in 1947, it was allocated to the new Indian Army and renamed the The Garhwal Rifles.
World War II (1939–45).
During World War II, five more battalions of the Garhwal Rifles were raised. These were: the 4th (re-raised having been converted into a training battalion and designated 10th Battalion earlier), the 5th, 6th, 7th and 25th (Garrison) battalion. The Regiment saw active service in almost all of the theatres of the war, including: Burma, Malaya, Egypt, Iraq, Eritrea, Abyssinia.
The 2nd and 5th Battalions were captured in the fall of Singapore and remained in captivity until the end of the war. 
The Regiment's casualties during the war were high, with some 350 killed and approximately 1,400 wounded.
Following the war the 1st and 3rd Battalions served briefly in a garrison role in Sumatra and Italy before returning to India. The 4th Battalion was used to reconstitute the 2nd Battalion in May 1946. The 5th Battalion was not raised again and the 6th Battalion was disbanded at war's end.

<doc id="18619339" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18619339" title="Slug">
Slug

Slug is a common name for an apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word "slug" is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, has a very reduced shell, or has only a small internal shell (this is in contrast to the common name "snail", which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can retract its soft parts fully into it).
Slugs exist on land and in the sea, and there is even one genus of freshwater slugs, "Acochlidium". The unadorned word "slug" is however applied primarily to land slugs, whereas slugs from the sea or from freshwater are usually referred to as "sea slugs" or "freshwater slugs". Land gastropods with a shell that is not quite vestigial, but is too small to retract into (like many in the family Urocyclidae), are known as semislugs.
Various taxonomic families of slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages, which also include snails. Thus, for example, the various families of land slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category "slug" is emphatically a polyphyletic one.
Slugs, like all other gastropods, undergo torsion (a 180° twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation—but externally, the bodies of land slugs appear more or less symmetrical, except for the positioning of the pneumostome, which is on one side of the animal, normally the right-hand side. The soft, slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation, so land-living slugs are confined to moist environments and must retreat to damp hiding places when the weather is dry. The subsequent information in this article applies to land slugs.
Taxonomy.
Of the six orders of Pulmonata, two – the Onchidiacea and Soleolifera – solely comprise slugs. A third family, the Sigmurethra, contains various clades of snails, semi-slugs (i.e. snails whose shells are too small for them to retract fully into) and slugs. The taxonomy of this group is in the process of being revised in the light of DNA sequencing. It appears that pulmonates are paraphyletic and basal to the opisthobranchs, which are a terminal branch of the tree. The family Ellobiidae are also polyphyletic.
Description.
Like other pulmonate land gastropods, the majority of land slugs have two pairs of 'feelers' or "tentacles" on their head. The upper pair is light sensing and has eyespots at the ends, while the lower pair provides the sense of smell. Both pairs are retractable, and can be regrown if lost.
On top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped "mantle," and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a respiratory opening, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. This opening is known as the pneumostome. Within the tissue of the mantle in some species is a very small, rather flat shell, or in some other cases a collection of calcareous granules.
Like most gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of muscular contraction on the underside of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of mucus that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues. Around the edge of the foot is the 'foot fringe' or 'skirt'.
Most slugs retain a remnant of their shell, which is usually internalized. This organ generally serves as storage for calcium salts, often in conjunction with the digestive glands. An internal shell is present in the Limacidae and Parmacellidae.
Adult Philomycidae, Onchidiidae and Veronicellidae lack shells.
Physiology.
Slugs' bodies are made up mostly of water, and without a full-sized shell, their soft tissues are prone to desiccation. They must generate protective mucus to survive. Many species are most active just after rain because of the moist ground. In drier conditions, they hide in damp places such as under tree bark, fallen logs, rocks, and man-made structures, such as planters, to help retain body moisture.
Slugs produce two types of mucus: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. Both kinds are hygroscopic. The thin mucus spreads from the foot's centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats the whole body of the animal.
The mucus secreted by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from slipping down vertical surfaces. The "slime trail" a slug leaves behind has some secondary effects: other slugs coming across a slime trail can recognise the slime trail as produced by one of the same species, which is useful in finding a mate. Following a slime trail is also part of the hunting behaviour of some carnivorous slugs. Body mucus provides some protection against predators, as it can make the slug hard to pick up and hold by a bird's beak, for example, and the mucus itself can be distasteful. Some species of slug, such as "Limax maximus", secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation.
Reproduction.
Slugs are hermaphrodites, having both female and male reproductive organs. Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia. A few days later, the slugs lay around thirty eggs in a hole in the ground, or beneath the cover of an object such as a fallen log.
Apophallation is a commonly seen practice among many slugs. In apophallating species, the penis curls like a corkscrew and during mating, it often becomes entangled in the mate's genitalia. Apophallation allows the slugs to separate themselves by one or both of the slugs chewing off the other's penis. Once its penis has been removed, the slug is still able to mate using only the female parts of its reproductive system.
Ecology.
Slugs play an important role in the ecosystem by eating decaying plant material and fungi. Most carnivorous slugs on occasion also eat dead of their own kind.
Feeding habits.
Most species of slugs are generalists, feeding on a broad spectrum of organic materials, including leaves from living plants, lichens, mushrooms, and even carrion. Some slugs are predators and eat other slugs and snails, or earthworms.
Slugs can feed on a wide variety of vegetables and herbs, including flowers such as petunias, chrysanthemums, daisies, lobelia, lilies, daffodils, narcissus, gentians, primroses, tuberous begonias, hollyhocks, irises, and fruits such as strawberries. They also feed on carrots, peas, apples, and cabbage that are offered as a sole food source.
Slugs from different families are fungivores. It is the case in the Philomycidae (e. g. "Philomycus carolinianus" and "Phylomicus flexuolaris") and "Ariolimacidae" ("Ariolimax californianus"), which respectively feed on slime molds (myxomycetes) and mushrooms (basidiomycetes). Species of mushroom producing fungi used as food source by slugs include milk-caps, "Lactarius" spp., the oyster mushroom, "Pleurotus ostreatus" and the penny bun, "Boletus edulis". Other species pertaining to different genera, such as "Agaricus", "Pleurocybella" and "Russula", are also eaten by slugs. Slime molds used as food source by slugs include "Stemonitis axifera" and "Symphytocarpus flaccidus". Some slugs are selective towards certain parts or developmental stages of the fungi they eat, though this is very variable. Depending on the species and other factors, slugs eat only fungi at specific stages of development. Moreover, in other cases, whole mushrooms can be eaten, without any selection or bias towards ontogenetic stages.
Predators.
Slugs are preyed upon by a myriad of vertebrates and invertebrates. The predation of slugs has been the subject of studies for at least a century. Because some species of slugs are considered agricultural pests, research investments have been made to comprehend and investigate potential predators. This is a necessary knowledge to establish biological control strategies.
Vertebrates.
Slugs are preyed upon by virtually every major vertebrate group. With many examples among reptiles, birds, mammals, amphibians and fish, vertebrates can occasionally feed on, or be specialized predators of slugs. Fish that feed on slugs include the brown trout, ("Salmo trutta"), which occasionally feeds on "Arion circumscriptus", an "arionid" slug. Similarly, the shortjaw kokopu ("Galaxias postvectis") includes slugs in its diet. Amphibians such as frogs and toads have long been regarded as important predators of slugs. Among them are species in the genus "Bufo" (e. g. "Bufo marinus") and "Ceratophrys".
Reptiles that feed on slugs include mainly snakes and lizards. Some colubrid snakes are known predators of slugs. Coastal populations of the garter snake,"Thamnophis elegans", have a specialized diet consisting of slugs, such as "Ariolimax", while inland populations have a generalized diet. One of its congeners, the Northwestern garter snake ("Thamnophis ordinoides"), is not a specialized predator of slugs but occasionally feed on them. The redbelly snake ("Storeria occipitomaculata") and the brown snake ("Storeria dekayi") feed mainly but not solely on slugs, while some species in the genus "Dipsas", "Sibynomorphus" (e.g. "Sibynomorphus neuwiedi") and the common slug eater snake ("Duberria lutrix"), are exclusively slug eaters. Several lizards include slugs in their diet. This is the case in the slow worm ("Anguis fragilis"), the bobtail lizard ("Tiliqua rugosa"), the she-oak skink ("Cyclodomorphus casuarinae") and the common lizard ("Zootoca vivipara").
Birds that prey upon slugs include common blackbirds, starlings ("Sturnus vulgaris"), rooks ("Corvus frugilegus"), jackdaws ("Corvus monedula"), owls, vultures and ducks. Studies on slug predation also cite fieldfares (feeding on "Deroceras reticulatum"), redwings (feeding on "Limax" and "Arion"), thrushes (on "Limax" and "Arion ater"), red grouse (on "Deroceras" and "Arion hortensis"), game birds, wrynecks (on "Limax flavus"), rock doves and charadriiform birds as slug predators.
Mammals that eat slugs, include foxes, badgers and hedgehogs.
Invertebrates.
Beetles in the family Carabidae, such as "Carabus violaceus" and "Pterostichus melanarius", are known to feed on slugs.
Parasites and parasitoids.
Slugs are parasitised by several organisms, including acari and a wide variety of nematodes. The slug mite, "Riccardoella limacum", is known to parasitise several dozen species of mollusks, including many slugs, such as "Agriolimax agrestis", "Arianta arbustrum", "Arion ater", "Arion hortensis", "Limax maximus", "Milax budapestensis", "Milax gagates", and "Milax sowerbyi". "R. limacum" can often be seen swarming about their host's body, and live in its respiratory cavity.
Several species of nematodes are known to parasitise slugs. The nematode worms "Agfa flexilis" and "Angiostoma limacis" respectively live in the salivary glands and rectum of "Limax maximus". Species of widely known medical importance pertaining to the genus "Angiostrongylus" are also parasites of slugs. Both "Angiostrongylus costaricensis" and "Angiostrongylus cantonensis", a meningitis-causing nematode, have larval stages that can only live in mollusks, including slugs, such as "Limax maximus".
Insects such as dipterans are known parasitoids of mollusks. To complete their development, many dipterans use slugs as hosts during their ontogeny. Some species of blow-flies (Calliphoridae) in the genus "Melinda" are known parasitoids of Arionidae, Limacidae and Philomycidae. Flies in the family Phoridae, specially those in the genus "Megaselia", are parasitoids of Agriolimacidae, including many species of "Deroceras". House flies in the family Muscidae, mainly those in the genus "Sarcophaga", are facultative parasitoids of Arionidae.
Behavior.
When attacked, slugs can contract their body, making themselves harder and more compact. By doing this, they become firmly attached to the substrate. This, combined with the slippery mucus they produce, makes slugs more difficult for predators to grasp. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent. Some species present different response behaviors when attacked, such as the Kerry slug. In contrast to the general behavioral pattern, the Kerry slug retracts its head, lets go of the substrate, rolls up completely, and stays contracted in a ball-like shape. This is a unique feature among all the Arionidae, and among most other slugs. Some slugs can self-amputate (autotomy) a portion of their tail to help the slug escape from a predator. Some slug species hibernate underground during the winter in temperate climates, but in other species, the adults die in the autumn.
Intra and inter-specific agonistic behavior is documented, but varies greatly among slug species. Slugs often resort to aggression, attacking both conspecifics and individuals from other species when competing for resources. This aggressiveness is also influenced by seasonality, because the availability of resources such as shelter and food may be compromised due to climatic conditions. Slugs are prone to attack during the summer, when the availability of resources is reduced. During winter, the aggressive responses are substituted by a gregarious behavior.
Human relevance.
The great majority of slug species are harmless to humans and to their interests, but a small number of species are serious pests of agriculture and horticulture. They can destroy foliage faster than plants can grow, thus killing even fairly large plants. They also feed on fruits and vegetables prior to harvest, making holes in the crop, which can make individual items unsuitable to sell for aesthetic reasons, and can make the crop more vulnerable to rot and disease.
As control measures, baits are the norm in both agriculture and the garden. In recent years, iron phosphate baits have emerged and are preferred over the toxic metaldehyde, especially because domestic or wild animals may be exposed to the bait. The environmentally safer iron phosphate has been shown to be at least as effective as poisonous baits. Methiocarb baits are no longer widely used. Beneficial nematodes ("Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita") are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens. These include beer traps, diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds, and copper. It is of scientific interest that salt kills slugs by causing water to leave the body owing to osmosis (demonstration) but this is not used for agricultural control as soil salinity is detrimental to crops.
In a few rare cases, humans have contracted parasite-induced meningitis from eating raw slugs. Live slugs that are accidentally eaten with improperly cleaned vegetables (such as lettuce), or improperly cooked slugs (for use in recipes requiring larger slugs such as banana slugs), can act as a vector for a parasitic infection in humans.

2008–09 KHL season

The 2008–09 KHL season was the inaugural season of the Kontinental Hockey League. It started on September 2, 2008, and finished on April 12, 2009. 24 teams each played 56 games.
League business.
NHL player transfer.
KHL teams have signed several players from the NHL, including Jaromír Jágr, Alexander Radulov, Ray Emery, Sergei Brylin, Ladislav Nagy, Jozef Stumpel, Marcel Hossa, Ben Clymer, Alexei Zhitnik, Bryan Berard, and Chris Simon.
Dispute.
A dispute between the two leagues over some of these signings was supposed to have been resolved by an agreement signed on July 10, whereby each league would honor the contracts of the other, but the signing of Alexander Radulov was made public one day after the agreement (though it was actually signed two days prior to the agreement taking effect), leading to an investigation by the International Ice Hockey Federation.
Finances.
Ownership.
On a deal dated October 30, Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works bought 11.76% of the KHL.
Salary cap.
The league has implemented a salary cap.
Economic trouble.
Metallurg Novokuznetsk has so far experienced difficulty financing its operations, largely due to the global financial crisis of 2008. Team sponsor Evraz Group is rumored to be cutting funding. There is a possibility the team will cease operations by New Years.
HC MVD has experienced delays in paying players, while Khimik Voskresensk has run itself into debt. Metallurg Magnitogorsk has been forced to cut staff expenditures by 30%. Avangard Omsk owner Roman Abramovich has promised to continue financial support so long as the team maintains good results. Other teams experiencing financial limitations are Vityaz Chekhov, Atlant Moscow Oblast, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, HC CSKA Moscow.
As far as the league is concerned it has devised a "crisis package" for dealing with the economic turmoil. Cuts will be made to non-salary expenditures, such as pre-game activity, training camps, and elimination of pre-season tournaments. Mid-level player salaries may also be rolled back. Divisional re-alignment will also take place for the 2009-10 season to cut down on travel costs.
Inaugural All-Star Game.
The inaugural KHL All-Star Game took place on January 10, 2009. Each team consisted of ten forwards, five defensemen, and two goaltenders. The starting rosters were voted upon on the KHL.ru website and decided by December 22. The secondary lines and goaltenders were to be voted upon by the media, and announced December 26, with the following players and reserves announced by January 8. The game took place in Moscow's Red Square, with Team Jágr (International All-Stars) defeating Team Yashin (Russian All-Stars) 7–6.
Regular season.
Death of Alexei Cherepanov.
On October 13, 2008 during a match between Avangard Omsk and Vityaz Chekhov, forward Alexei Cherepanov died due to a heart condition.
On December 29, 2008, Russian investigators revealed that he suffered from myocarditis, a condition where not enough blood gets to the heart, and that he should not have been playing professional hockey. The federal Investigative Committee also announced that a chemical analysis of Cherepanov's blood and urine samples allowed experts to conclude "that for several months Alexei Cherepanov engaged in doping". Official sources have stated the banned substance taken was nikethamide, a stimulant, and that it had been taken 3 hours prior to the game in which he died.
Omsk club director Mikhail Denisov has since been fired, whereas the league Disciplinary Committee has since removed Omsk's doctors from that role with the club, and has suspended Avangard general manager Anatoly Bardin and team president Konstantin Potapov. The KHL Disciplinary Committee met on this matter on January 5, and also suspended Chekhov's team president.

Patrick Bell

Rev Patrick Bell (12 May 1799 – 22 April 1869) was a Church of Scotland minister and inventor.
Biography.
Born in the rural parish of Auchterhouse in Angus, Scotland, into a farming family, Bell chose to study divinity at the University of St Andrews. He was Carmyllie parish minister from 1843 until his death.
The Reaping Machine.
Bell invented the reaping machine while working on his father's farm. His interest in mechanics led him to work on a horse powered mechanical reaper for speeding up the harvest. In 1828 his machine was used with success on his father's farm and others in the district.
This reaping machine used a revolving 12 vane reel to pull the crop over the cutting knife, that was made from triangular reciprocating blades over fixed triangular blades. A canvas conveyor moved the grain and stalks to the side in a windrow. This machine was pushed by livestock and ran on 2 wheels.
Bell never sought a patent for his reaping machine. Being a man of God, he believed his invention should benefit all mankind. Therefore he never made any financial gain from its success throughout the world.
On May 3, 1831, a patent was issued in the United States to William Manning for the reaper of essentially the same design. On December 31, 1833, a similar cutter patent was issued to Obed Hussey. A vibrating cutter was patented by Cyrus McCormick on June 21, 1834. McCormick with his brothers mass-produced the machines and developed what became the International Harvester Company.

Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders

The Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders is an authorized volunteer pipe band associated with The Calgary Highlanders of the Canadian Forces. For many years, the band was a bona fide, and separate, military unit unto itself, with a separate Unit Identification Code within the CF. Today, the band has been reduced to volunteer status but officially maintains an establishment of eight paid military musicians on its rolls. The band has had mixed success in competitions, but under the direction of Pipe Major Michael Giles had become successful in the Grade Three circuit in Alberta in the years leading up to the regimental centennial in 2010. The band published a recording to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Regiment in 1990, titled "Eighty Years of Glory" and commemorated its centennial in 2010 by releasing a second CD entitled "Onward".
History.
The first pipe band was recruited for the regiment in the early 1920s, drawing on the musical talents in the Calgary area, including many civilian pipers playing with the Calgary Scottish Pipe Band. The band thrived through the donations of interested citizens and fund-raising; interested benefactors including Honorary Colonel R.B. Bennett who donated uniforms to the band in 1923, though the choice of tartan later proved controversial as noted below.
During the Second World War, two pipe bands were in existence, one for each battalion of the regiment. Members of the 1st Battalion Pipe Band were trained soldiers. At Hill 67, pipers were assigned to each of the four rifle companies and played the battalion into their first combat action in Normandy - the only time in the war they were permitted to do so.
In 1945, the Calgary Highlanders reverted to a one-battalion Militia unit again. The Pipes and Drums continued their role of support to regimental functions, recruiting, and after the reorganizations of Unification of the three services in 1968, became a separate unit of the Canadian Forces. 
The Pipes and Drums' membership declined in the 1970s, as military service became increasingly unpopular due to the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. The band was officially de-activated in 1975, after having been reduced to nil-strength in 1969. Under the direction of Pipe Major Don Maxwell, the band was rebuilt into a successful competition band, and Maxwell received admittance to the Order of Military Merit in the rank of Member in 1983 for reviving the Pipes and Drums.
The band went into another period of decline following Maxwell's departure to form his own band in the 1980s, concentrating its efforts on regimental functions and street parades and performing poorly in competition. All members were required to complete basic military training, attend military musical courses, and take part in other unit training as deemed fit by the commanding officer. Civilian volunteers were, however, still permitted to augment the band's membership. It was during this time that the band lost access to a dedicated practice space. Officially a lodger unit in the garrison at Mewata Armouries, the band was assigned offices and a large practice room on the second floor. In 1991, the band was relocated to a series of unfinished rooms in the armoury basement, with an abandoned coal storage room expected to serve as a pipe practice room. In the mid-1990s, official funding as a separate unit was cut to military pipe bands throughout Canada, as the end of the Cold War caused a major reassessment of defence spending in NATO countries. The Highlanders were reduced to just two paid positions, with the remaining vacancies being filled by civilian and military volunteers. Several experienced pipers and drummers left the band for other duties within the military.
After several changes of Pipe Major in the 1990s and into the 21st Century, Pipe Major Michael Giles has recently improved the Regimental Pipes and Drums' performance on the competition circuit as well as resumed its practice of earning the title of "best pipe band" in the Calgary Stampede Parade. As a military band, the Pipes and Drums have been recognized for their dress and deportment at civilian competitions as well.
Uniform.
The Pipes and Drums erroneously adopted the Royal Stewart tartan in 1923. The drummers switched to Government tartan 
in 1929 to reflect the regiment's alliance with The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In 1939, the regiment mobilized a battalion for overseas service in the Second World War; eventually two battalions of Calgary Highlanders came into existence, one in Europe and one in Canada, each with its own Pipe Band. The 1st Battalion band in the United Kingdom was told it was not permitted to wear the Royal Stewart tartan; the 2nd Battalion continued to wear the tartan in Calgary. After 1945, the overseas battalion was disbanded, and the one-battalion regiment reverted to having just one band, clad in Government tartan.
Dress regulations have generally followed that of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of the British Army in most respects; in 1992, tartan ribbons were added to the bagpipes to pay homage to both the appointment of Queen Elizabeth II as Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment (by wearing a Royal Stewart tartan on the front) and the contributions of the Calgary Scottish Pipe Band in the formative years of the band (by adopting Gordon tartan ribbons on the back).
In the 1990s, piper and kilt-maker David Hongisto provided the band with its first white doublets for use as summer full dress; patterned after similar jackets worn by the British Army, this style of uniform had not been employed previously in the band's history.
Less formal orders of dress have generally been a mix of standard military service dress (either battle dress, DEU or shirtsleeves) and Highland dress as appropriate.
Style.
The band is properly styled as The Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders. The word "The" is always capitalized when it prefixes "Calgary Highlanders" as it forms part of the proper name of the regiment. An accepted short form is "Pipes and Drums". While reference to "the Band" is usually clearly understood, use of same is officially discouraged because in military parlance, a "band" consists of brass/reed instruments, as distinct from a pipe and drum band. In the 1920s, The Calgary Highlanders in fact did have a brass/reed band in addition to a pipe band; this brass band disappeared before the Second World War.
Schedule.
The Pipes and Drums have maintained regular attendance at several key events in their annual schedule, including:
Not all observances are made directly on the dates indicated; as a reserve unit many regimental parades are scheduled for the Wednesday or weekend closest to the date in question instead.
Musical partnerships.
The Pipes and Drums have formed beneficial, if unofficial, musical partnerships over the years.
Legacy.
The history of the band is preserved in part by displays in The Calgary Highlanders regimental gallery at The Military Museums in Calgary, and archival material related to the band are held by the regimental archives, also at the same location.

Ground Zero Man is a science fiction novel by Bob Shaw, first published in 1971, and then revised as The Peace Machine in 1985.
The plot follows the main character, Lucas Hutchman, an "undistinguished mathematician", who invents a machine that may detonate virtually instantaneously every nuclear bomb in the world, by inducing a "self-propagating neutron resonance". Overcoming technical and personal difficulties, Hutchman manages to build the device and to warn Earth's governments of its existence, but is tracked down and prevented to use it. At the end, Hutchman realises that rather than to the elimination of nuclear weapons, his invention just led to further investments in them, to create new bombs impervious to neutron resonance.

Omar Koroma

Omar Alieu Koroma (born on 22 October 1989) is a Gambian footballer. He is the first ever Gambian to be signed by an English Premier League club. He plays as a striker and has previously represented Portsmouth, Norwich City and Forest Green Rovers.
Career.
Koroma trained with English side Watford in October 2007. He impressed, but was unable to secure a contract due to work permit issues. He also trained with Southampton but again, could not sign a professional contract with the club.
In July 2008 he was then offered a two-week trial with Premier League side Portsmouth, featuring in some of their pre-season friendlies and impressing enough to be offered a contract. He was eligible for a work permit after recently marrying a British partner.
On 4 August 2008 Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp confirmed that a two-year contract for Koroma had been completed from Banjul Hawks, and confirmed that the striker would be spending the 2008–09 season at then Championship side Norwich City on loan. He made his debut for Norwich on 9 August 2008 as a substitute in a 2–0 defeat at Coventry City.
In late December 2008, Koroma suffered a serious ankle injury, which necessitated surgery. This took place in January 2009, leaving him a likely recovery period of 10 to 12 weeks. He returned to Portsmouth at the end of January but was released the following summer.
He trialed in Denmark, trialing for Brondby IF. He impressed Brondby and Denmark striker Peter Madsen when on trial with the Danish Superliga club. 
He then went on trial with Conference Premier side Forest Green Rovers. He scored a brace in a 2–1 reserve team victory over Crawley Town on 23 April 2012. After a lengthy trial period with Forest Green, Koroma agreed to a three-year contract at the club in May 2012.
He made his Forest Green debut on 27 August 2012 although was sent off after 34 minutes in an away game against Kidderminster Harriers. After making 20 league appearances for the club, he left on 23 January 2014 by mutual consent.
International.
In September 2008, Koroma was called up to the Gambia senior squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Liberia and Senegal, making his international debut as a late substitute for Njogu Demba as the Gambian's ran out 3–0 victors.

Born in Newbury, Massachusetts, Woods attended Phillips Andover Academy before graduating from Union College in 1827 with Phi Beta Kappa honors and membership in The Kappa Alpha Society. After having graduated from Andover Theological Seminary, he made a translation of George Christian Knapp's "Christian Theology", which became long used as a textbook in American theological seminaries. 
When he became president of Bowdoin in 1839, he was only 32 years old. He held his position until 1866. During his tenure, the College built Appleton Hall, the Chapel, and Adams Hall, which housed the Medical School of Maine and the undergraduate laboratories. A recipient of advanced degrees from Colby College, Harvard University, and Bowdoin, Woods died in 1878 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Elaine Sterne Carrington

Elaine Sterne Carrington (June 14, 1891, New York, New York – May 4, 1958, New York, New York) was an American screenwriter, playwright, novelist and short story author who found her greatest success writing for radio. Carrington originated radio soap opera in 1932, and wrote more than 12,000 daily dramas during her long career. At one time she wrote three separate shows — "Pepper Young's Family", "When a Girl Marries" and "Rosemary" — that each ran five times a week. 
Biography.
Elaine Sterne was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Marie Louise Henriques and Theodore Sterne, an importer of tobacco. Sterne was educated at Columbia University. In 1920, she married attorney George Dart Carrington, whom she had met in grade school. He died in 1945. They had two children, Patricia and Robert.
She began writing films in 1913, and her scenario for "The Sins of the Mothers" (1914) won first prize in a contest sponsored by "The New York Evening Sun" and Vitagraph Studios. By 1930 she had 50 screenwriting credits — including one for "Alibi", the 1929 adaptation of her 1927 Broadway play, "Nightstick", which she wrote with J.C. Nugent, Elliot Nugent and John Wray. She also wrote several one-act vaudeville plays including "A Good Provider" (1928), "The Red Hat", "Five Minutes from the Station", and "Fear".
Elaine Sterne's first published story, "The King of the Christmas Feast," appeared in the December 1914 issue of "St. Nicholas Magazine". By the time she was in her 20s her fiction appeared in popular magazines including "Collier's", "Good Housekeeping", "Harper's Magazine", "Pictorial Review", "Redbook", "The Saturday Evening Post" and "Woman's Home Companion". She also wrote novels, including "The Road to Ambition" (1917) and "The Gypsy Star" (1936), and she collected some of her short fiction in the 1939 book, "All Things Considered".
Carrington's writing career was transformed in 1932, when a friend persuaded her to approach the National Broadcasting Company about trying a dramatic serial on radio. Starring Burgess Meredith, the 15-minute drama "Red Adams" ran three days a week (October 2, 1932–January 22, 1933). When it found a new sponsor it was renamed "Red Davis" (October 2, 1933–May 24, 1935).
"It was put on five days a week and became an enormous hit with housewives whose attentions could be diverted from the tedium of housekeeping," wrote "The New York Times" in 1958. "The program changed sponsors again — this time to a soap company — and it became the famous "Pepper Young's Family", for which Mrs. Carrington at her death was still writing five fifteen-minute programs a week." 
Carrington created a second serial drama, "When a Girl Marries" (1939–1957), and a third, "Rosemary" (1944–1955) — requiring her to produce about 38,000 words a week. In 1946 she was earning $200,000 a year.
In 1946 she created "The Carrington Playhouse", a radio show that produced original plays that won its weekly contest. She also wrote patriotic scripts for the U.S. government during World War II, and after the war wrote dramas for "Robert Montgomery Presents" and other television programs.
Carrington's full-length plays include "Remember Me?" (1953), "Maggie, Pack Your Bags" (1954), and "The Empress", a 1955 comedy that was presented in Westport, Connecticut, with Geraldine Page.
"Pepper Young's Family" continued for a year after Carrington's death on May 4, 1958. She died at New York Hospital at age 66, after a brief illness.
"No one ever came close to Mrs. Carrington's formidable output," reported "The New York Times", "and in the world of radio the plump, pleasant, mink-clad author was universally known as 'the Queen of the Soapers.'"

USS Redwood (AN-30)

USS "Redwood" (AN-30/YN-25) was an "Aloe"-class net laying ship which was assigned to serve the U.S. Navy during World War II with her protective anti-submarine nets.
Built in Cleveland, Ohio.
"Redwood" (YN-25) was laid down by the American Shipbuilding Company, Cleveland, Ohio, 18 October 1940; launched 22 February 1941; and commissioned 12 December 1942, Lt. Comdr. Max A. Morrison, USNR, in command.
World War II.
Following shakedown, "Redwood" steamed south to the British West Indies. Engaged in the installation of torpedo nets at Trinidad until March 1943, she shifted to Antigua in April, tending nets there through May. Net maintenance activities at Barbados, St. Thomas, and St. Lucia Islands followed and, in mid August, she commenced similar activities at Guantanamo Bay. For the remainder of World War II she tended nets there and at ports on Hispaniola.
Reclassified "AN-30", 20 January 1944, "Redwood" returned to Trinidad in August 1945 and through September assisted in disposal of nets at sea.
Post-war decommissioning.
She then sailed for the U.S. East Coast and, after availability at Charleston Navy Yard, she reported on 24 November to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she decommissioned 6 June 1947. In June 1961 she was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet.

The 2007 festival was notable for the extremely dusty conditions that prevailed on the later days of the event. The area had been under drought conditions for some time; this fact combined with the heavy, repeated foot traffic over the dry ground led to a permeating dust cloud that covered the ground and continued up into the air as high as . Many people were seen wearing bandannas as facemasks on Sunday of the festival, and the dust-covered cars served well as places to write various messages.

Business/SPEA Information Commons

The Business/SPEA Information Commons, formerly known as the Business/SPEA Library, serves the research and study needs of faculty and students of Indiana University's Kelley School of Business and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA).
The Commons is a part of the Indiana University Libraries system and modeled on the successful implementation of the commons
concept in library management both at IU and major
university libraries. The Business/SPEA
Information Commons provides a welcoming environment for research and
study not only for its core constituency of Business School and SPEA
students and faculty, but also to all students of the university and
the residents of the state.
The Business/SPEA Information Commons provides access to a wide variety of electronic databases and print resources in a setting that promotes collaborative research. The Business/SPEA Information Commons is centrally located between the Schools of Business and SPEA. In addition to the circulating print collection, there is a reference room which includes print materials and electronic databases such as Bloomberg, Valueline, and 
Datastream. The Business/SPEA Information
Commons includes a staff of three librarians, professional assistants,
support staff, and part-time student employees.
History.
The current combined library for the School of Business and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs dates back to 1935 when Herman B Wells, then Dean of the School of Business appointed a library committee to investigate the establishment of a departmental library.
There were several reasons in favor of establishing a library. The first was the distance of the School of Business (then located in the Social Science Building) from the University Library (then located in Franklin Hall). Instead of using the time between classes to study, students would do everything but study rather than walk two blocks to the University Library. Secondly, the University Library reading rooms were always crowded. Third, faculty members needed a convenient location to store the supplementary texts which they had placed on reserve for their students. Faculty members thought these texts should be located in close proximity to where students attended class. Fourth, business and economics students needed specialized help which the generalists at the University Library could not provide. Finally, faculty members believed that student study habits would be improved if they had a reading room near their classrooms.
Several steps were taken prior to the establishment of the Library. A supervised study hall was set up in 1936 to see whether students would use it. Proving successful, the Board of Trustees authorized a Business Administration Reading Room with an appropriation of $600 to furnish the room. The first books in the library were delivered by Harold Lusk, Chairman of the Library committee which established the Library delivered the Library's first books in his car! The reading room had 61 seats and was open from 7:45 a.m. to 9:50 p.m. Monday through Friday, 7:45 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday and 2 p.m. to 9:50 p.m. on Sunday. Library rules directed that overdue books were to be returned to the Dean's office and that fines should be paid there.
Located in the west corner of the second floor of the Social Science Building, the reading room was originally staffed by participants in the National Youth Administration, one of the New Deal agencies established by Franklin Roosevelt. A consensus soon developed that the Business School must hire a professionally trained librarian with experience in acquiring new materials, managing the reading room, and organizing the collection. When Geraldine Bariani was hired, her first move was to compile a card catalog for the Reading Room's materials. Perhaps the most important acquisition was a complete set of Listing Statements of the New York Stock Exchange from 1884-1930. Bariani believed that the Business Library was the only library except for the NYSE to own the complete set.
In 1940, a survey by the American Library Association of IU's branch libraries found that the Business and Economics Library was used more than any other branch. So it was propitious that when the Business School moved into a new building (now named Woodburn Hall) in 1940, of course the Library moved along with it and received several benefits, including more space for a larger collection. A new assistant librarian was hired in accordance with the faculty's wish that the reading room should be staffed at all hours that the Library was open.
While serving as Business School Librarian, Bariani wrote her master's thesis in which she outlined her objectives for the Business and Economics Library:
In 1942, IU's library system was reorganized and the Business and Economics Library's status changed from an independent library to a reserve library. The periodical collection was limited to current copies of business periodicals and the older bound copies of business journals were kept in the central library.
The Rawles Reading Room, named in honor of the first Dean of the School of Business was dedicated in May 1942 and planned as a browsing room for cultural reading. There were works by Shakespeare, Aristotle, Homer and Plato and more recent books such as Bellamy's Looking Backward and Pearl Buck's The Good Earth. It was Rawles' intention to "provide for the Students in his School cultural books which would broaden and enrich their background."
In 1966, the School of Business and its Library moved from Woodburn Hall to 10th Street across from the Main Library which was then under construction. 
In 1973, the School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA) was established in the Poplars Research Center. 
In 1982, a new complex of buildings was dedicated connecting the Schools of Business and of Public and Environmental Affairs. The School of Business' building was renovated and a new building was put up for the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, which was then housed in the Poplars Research and Conference Center. The two schools were linked by a spacious outdoor plaza and a new Business/SPEA Library with holdings of 120,000 volumes, including 2400 periodical volumes.
The library cost $16 million to build. The new library's design won a 1983 National Exhibit Award from the American Association of School Administrators, a 1983 Design Award from the National School Boards Association, and a 1984 Merit Award from the Minnesota Society of Landscape Architects. The design successfully expanded the Business School Library's space and created an entirely new facility for SPEA.

The D Case

The D Case (full English title: "The D. Case, Or The Truth About The Mystery Of Edwin Drood") (original Italian title: "La verità sul caso D.", 'The truth about the D. case') is a humorous literary critique of Charles Dickens' unfinished work "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", first published in Italy in 1989.
Written in the form of a novel, by Italian authors Carlo Fruttero and Franco Lucentini, the book explores the Dickens mystery from the perspective of many famous literary detectives, such as C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, and Hercule Poirot, all of whom come to their own conclusions regarding how the tale might possibly have ended. The novel presents the criticism in a postmodern style by alternating between chapters of the Fruttero and Lucentini work and the original unfinished story by Dickens. This is established under the setting of a convention that has been organized by affluent Japanese patrons to finish unfinished works of art. The chapters of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" are presented in the frame of this story as being read to those in attendance of this seminar. In the alternating chapters written by Fruttero and Lucentini, the aforementioned literary detectives discuss their theories and ask questions regarding the possible clues to the story's conclusion. The conclusion that the book ultimately comes to does not offer any serious answer to the story's possible ending; however, the preceding chapters offer criticism that examines the text in a way that is both accessible and academic.

Exodus Refugee Immigration

Exodus Refugee Immigration is a refugee resettlement agency located on 1125 Brookside Ave. Suite C Indianapolis, IN, 46202. Exodus Refugee Immigration is affiliated with two national VOLAGs, the Church World Service (CWS) and the Episcopal Migration Ministries (EMM). These VOLAGs are assigned cases by the Refugee Processing Center in Arlington, Virginia whereby government funds are provided for the resettlement of refugees. These funds are channeled through the VOLAGs into local resettlement agencies such as Exodus, who work with local communities and religious organizations to provide housing, employment services, ESL and financial services to the incoming refugees. 
Overview.
Exodus works with both the Church World Service and Episcopal Migration Ministires to resettle the refugees that are assigned to Indiana. Most of the refugees Exodus receives are from the Chin and Karen ethnic groups in Eastern Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Western Myanmar, respectively. The Myanmarese government, controlled by a military junta, has declared these two states as no-go zones. Anyone caught in these zones can be shot, forced in to labor, and exploited legally. As a result many Chin and Karen flee to neighboring Thailand and Malaysia where they may wait years in refugee camps until being resettled in the United States. Most Chin and Karen refugees are resettled into the Southport, Stop Ten, Stop Eleven area of Indianapolis.
Exodus Refugee Immigration has 11 people on staff, most of which are caseworkers. Of these 11 people, 5 were refugees themselves once, and are members of the Chin people and the Karen people. They work actively with the burgeoning Chin and Karen populations in southern Indianapolis, providing translation, transportation, medical, financial, and social services.
Mission Statement.
Exodus Refugee Immigration works with refugees -- worldwide victims of persecution, injustice and war -- to establish self-sufficient lives in freedom and sanctuary for themselves and their families in Indiana.

A Coy Decoy

A Coy Decoy is a 1941 Warner Bros. cartoon, directed by Bob Clampett and featuring Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. The film is set in a closed book store at night, when the many characters and elements featured within the books come to life. The idea would later be reworked five years later into "Book Revue", although only Daffy features in that.
Plot.
The film begins with Ludwig van Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" playing as the scene descends on a book store. The camera pans across an array of various books (including a gag in which "Uncle Tom's Cabin" now has a Federal Housing Administration sign in front).
Porky Pig, featured on the cover of "The Westerner", comes to life and sings "Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride." Across the way, Daffy Duck, featured on the cover of "The Ugly Duckling", comes to life and sings "Git Along, Little Dogies." Daffy finds his way to "Black Beauty" and comes out riding not a horse, but a big black woman, whom he rides to "The Lake".
A wolf emerges from the screenplay of "The Wolf of Wall Street", sneaks behind "The Green Bay Tree" and lures Daffy to him using a female duck decoy from the book "Toys". Daffy follows and grabs what he thinks is the decoy but is actually the wolf's nose. Once he realizes he is in danger, Daffy tells the wolf that he is not worth eating (he claims to have so many diseases that even the draft rejected him) and runs away.
Daffy uses the books to defeat the wolf. He opens a copy of "The Hurricane" to blow the wolf away, and lightning from the book "Lightning" strikes the wolf. The wolf surrenders, fittingly under Ernest Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls".
Daffy returns to the decoy. Porky enters the scene addresses the audience in derision of Daffy, saying that Daffy and the decoy could never "mean anything to each other." Daffy sticks up his nose and swims away with the decoy, followed by four tiny decoys that look like Daffy.

The Quadrilateral group or the Quad is an informal group which includes the trade ministers of the European Commission, the United States, Japan and Canada. It was first suggested during a private meeting during the 7th G7 summit in July 1981. Initially, a trilateral group was proposed (excluding Canada) because of tensions between the two North American countries at the time but eventually, the Canadian government successfully lobbied to be included. The European Commission has avoided formalizing the group because of resistance from certain European Union members, particularly France, who resent their lack of direct involvement.

He failed to break into the first team at Bramall Lane and after two years in the team youth and reserve sides he was transferred to Shropshire club Shrewsbury Town on his first of two spells at the club. The Englishman enjoyed three years at Gay Meadow making over 100 appearances, scoring twelve goals in all competitions and achieving a Third Division title win with the club during his first year.
In 1997, Walton was signed by Crewe Alexandra for £500,000, making him the most expensive player in the Railwaymen's history only for it to be broken a year later when Rodney Jack was signed for £650,000 from Torquay United. The defender spent six seasons at the club, the longest time he had spent at a club in his career, where he made over 150 league appearances for the south Cheshire club despite a number of injuries. In his last season at the club, Walton helped Crewe to the runners-up spot and promotion in Division Two after making 41 league appearances.
Manager Dario Gradi made his feelings clear that he wished to keep Walton at the club and offered him a new contract. The defender rejected and instead signed a two year deal with Derby County. However, an injury during pre–season left the Englishman out until October where he made his début in a 2-1 defeat at Norwich City. Walton failed to establish himself in George Burley's first team and was soon loaned out to Stockport County where he made seven league appearances.
After a year at Pride Park, the defender had his contract cancelled by mutual consent. He was soon picked up by his old club Shrewsbury. He added a further 38 league appearances and helped his side survive relegation from the football league. At the start of the 2005–06 season, he was given the role of club captain. Unfortunately, Walton's campaign of marred by injuries and in December 2005 he was forced to retire after sustaining a knee problem.

Music.
Estancia was once noted for its fine music program. From 1970 until 1981 the instrumental music program was under the direction of Peter P. Fournier. During that time the program grew from 40 musicians to over 100, and the school boasted a well rounded instrumental department that included an Intermediate Band, a Symphonic Wind Ensemble, a Jazz Ensemble, a String/Full Orchestra, and a Marching Band.
The marching band, at its peak, enjoyed many successes at SCSBOA Parade Band competitions in Southern California, including first place awards at the Colton and Santa Monica Band Reviews, as well as a well deserved appearance in the 1977 Rose Parade.
During Mr. Fournier's time at Estancia HS the concert groups enjoyed an unprecedented series of achievements in concert venues, including many unanimous superior rating ratings at both district and regional festivals for the wind ensemble, symphonic band and orchestra. The wind ensemble performed by invitation for the CMEA Western Region Convention in Tucson, AZ in 1972, the CMEA National Convention in Anaheim in 1974 where the brass ensemble opened the exhibition hall and the wind ensemble performed with composer Dr. Brett Heisinger. 
Since the departure of Mr. Fournier in 1981, EHS, like all schools in the NMUSD has undergone a steady decline in the department due to lack of district support for music. What used to be a vibrant and important program for the high school consisting of seven periods of instrumental performing ensembles (as well as a similarly outstanding and complete chorale program) has declined to a few students and one part time instructor.

The Nevada Policy Research Institute (NPRI) is a private non-profit, free-market and limited-government policy research organization based in Las Vegas, Nevada. NPRI seeks to promote private, rather than government solutions to issues facing Nevada and the western region of the United States.
Financial support & Resources.
NPRI receives support from private individuals and foundations and accepts no money from the government.
Issues.
NPRI currently researches education tax and fiscal policy [http://npri.org/publications/filter.20/policy_area.asp, and labor [http://npri.org/publications/filter.19/policy_area.asp] issues related to Nevada public policy.
Education.
NPRI opposes recent political decisions to halt the opening of new charter schools and favors expanding charter school options, tuition tax credits, school voucher programs, and merit pay for teachers.
NPRI has been highly critical of the Nevada System of Higher Education, specifically the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the University of Nevada, Reno for low graduation rates, despite spending above average per full-time student on education and education related higher education expenditures.
Tax and Fiscal Policy.
NPRI supports a balanced budget with controlled growth in government spending, such as a TABOR's or TASC amendment. NPRI claims Nevada's 2008-2009 budget deficit was the result of excessive growth in government spending.
NPRI has also argued that Nevada's history as a low-tax state has been slowly eroded by a growing number of fees on Nevada's residents.
NPRI opposes tax hikes on individual taxpayers and corporations within Nevada, including a tax hike on the gaming industry.
See also, the 2008 Nevada budget crisis.
Labor Issues.
NPRI supports protecting secret ballot boxes and paycheck protection and opposes defined benefit plans for union and government workers.
LVCVA.
On November 30, 2008 the "Las Vegas Review Journal" published an article regarding some investigative journalism conducted by the Nevada Policy Research Institute on the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. According to NPRI's investigation it appears the LVCVA has an inappropriate relationship with a private marketing firm, R&R, that has overbilled the LVCVA but the LVCVA has never attempted to "recoup these losses.
Through public records request NPRI found that the LVCVA not only knew about these irregularities but literally gave R&R the rubber stamp to approve expenditures above $5,000 without any oversight from the LVCVA.
According to NPRI, the LVCVA is funded by the room tax ($220 million in revenue), taking in more money than the Clark County School District, and is also a state agency subject to state laws regarding employees, benefits, and travel expenses.
The contract with R&R Partners is worth $87 million.
According to NPRI vice president, "In the days following the release of this project, multiple private investigators visited the institute's offices requesting our financial statements and claiming to be working for "the other side." Some of our board members have been approached with broad hints about retaliation if the institute's look into convention authority financing proceeds."

<doc id="18619810" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18619810" title="History of Blackburn Rovers F.C.">
History of Blackburn Rovers F.C.

Blackburn Rovers are an English football club formed in 1875.
The early years.
The club Blackburn Rovers was the idea of John Lewis and Arthur Constantine during a seventeen-man meeting at the Leger Hotel, Blackburn on 5 November 1875. The club's first secretary was Walter Duckworth, and Lewis was its first treasurer. Many of the initial members were wealthy and well-connected. Blackburn has had a particular strong history of football, Rovers weren't the town's only side in the 19th century; other rivals included Blackburn Olympic F.C. (1883 winners of the FA Cup) and Blackburn Park Road F.C., among others.
The first match played by Blackburn Rovers took place in Church, Lancashire on 11 December 1875.
During the 1876–77 season, Rovers finally gained a ground of its own by renting a piece of farmland at Oozehead, on the west side of town facing Preston New Road. The ground was little more than a meadow with a pool in the middle that had to be covered with planks and turf for matches. Occasional games were also played at Pleasington Cricket Ground.
Subsequently Blackburn Rovers rented Alexandra Meadows, the home of the East Lancashire Cricket Club, for their matches. The inaugural game at Alexandra Meadows was played against Partick Thistle.
On 28 September 1878, Blackburn Rovers became one of 23 clubs to form the Lancashire Football Association. On 1 November 1879 the club played in the FA Cup for the first time, beating the Tyne Association Football Club 5–1. Rovers were eventually put out of the competition in the third round after suffering a heavy 6–0 defeat by Nottingham Forest.
During the 1881–82 season, the club continued to rent the facilities at Alexandra Meadows, but began to look towards a move elsewhere. As the leading club in the area, it was felt that Rovers needed its own ground. A ground was leased at Leamington Street and £500 was spent on a new grandstand capable of seating 600–700 spectators. Boards were placed around the pitch to help prevent a repeat of the crowd troubles with Darwen, and a large ornate entrance arch was erected bearing the name of the club and ground.
On 25 March 1882, the club won through to the final of the FA Cup against the Old Etonians. Blackburn Rovers was the first provincial team to reach the final, but the result was a 1–0 defeat by the Old Etonians. There was no repeat of the previous season's success during the 1882–83 season, when Rovers suffered a bitter defeat 1–0 at the hands of Darwen in the second-round. Local rivals Blackburn Olympic went on to be the first provincial team to actually win the FA Cup.
Rovers finally won the FA Cup on 29 March 1884 — the year Thomas Mitchell joined as manager — at the Kennington Oval, with a 2–1 victory over the Scottish team Queen's Park F.C. Had it not been for this cup success the club would have folded leaving Blackburn Olympic the primary team in Blackburn. The same teams played the FA Cup final again the next season, with Blackburn Rovers again emerging victorious, with a 2–0 score. Rovers repeated this success yet again the next season, winning the final against West Bromwich Albion. For this three-in-a-row of FA Cup victories, the club was awarded a specially commissioned silver shield and given the unique privilege of displaying the club crest on its corner flags.
The Football League and Ewood Park.
On 2 March 1888, William McGregor, a Birmingham shopkeeper and a committee member of Aston Villa Football Club, sent a letter to five clubs — Blackburn Rovers among them — suggesting that twelve of the leading clubs should organise a series of home and away matches between themselves. With the introduction of professional players, it seemed natural that better organisation should be brought to the complex and chaotic system of friendly and competitive matches prevalent at the time. On 22 March 1888 John Birtwistle represented Blackburn Rovers at a meeting of a number of clubs at the Anderton Hotel in London. This meeting, and subsequent ones, led to the creation of the Football League, with Blackburn Rovers as part of it. Rovers finished the inaugural season of the league in fourth place, and unbeaten at home.
Blackburn Rovers again reached the FA Cup final on 29 March 1890 at the Kennington Oval. The club claimed the trophy, for the fourth time, by beating Sheffield Wednesday a hefty 6–1 — with left forward William Townley scoring three goals and becoming the first player to achieve a hat-trick in the FA Cup final. The summer of 1890 brought yet another significant event in the history of Blackburn Rovers with the decision to move again. The choice of new home was Ewood Park, and it remained the club's home for the next century or more.
Ewood Park was built in 1882, the idea of four local businessmen, and it had hosted a number of sporting events. In 1890 Blackburn Rovers purchased the ground and spent a further £1000 on refurbishments to bring it up to standard. The first match was played on 13 September 1890 against Accrington, with a 0–0 draw result.
The 1890–1891 season saw Blackburn Rovers win the FA Cup for fifth time against Notts County F.C. with a 3–1 victory — but this success marked beginning of a lengthy period without silverware at national level. With Mitchell still in the manager's seat, Rovers continued their solid league form — Rovers never finished worse than ninth in the top flight until after Mitchell's departure in 1896.
Early 20th century.
Blackburn Rovers continued to struggle during the early years of the 20th century, but the results began a gradual improvement. Major renovations were made to Ewood Park: in 1905 the Darwen End was covered at a cost of £1680 and the new Nuttall Stand was opened on New Year's Day 1907. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Blackburn Rovers were still considered a top side in the English league. They were league champions in 1912 and 1914, and FA Cup winners in 1928, but the FA Cup win was their last major trophy for nearly 70 years.
Mid 20th century.
Blackburn Rovers maintained a respectable mid-table position in the First Division until they were finally relegated (along with Aston Villa) from the top flight (for the first time since the foundation of the league) in the 1935–36 season. Their final match prior to relegation was a triumph. By the last game of the season, they were already certain to be relegated, but at Villa Park, they beat the home side, thus dragging the only other team of the original Football League who had never been relegated, Aston Villa, with them. They struggled in the second division for the next two seasons, until winning the Second Division title in the final season before the war.
When the league resumed after the war, Blackburn Rovers were relegated in their second season (1947–48) and remained in the second division for the following ten years. After promotion in 1958, they again returned to the mid-table position they had occupied in the earlier part of the century. During this time, they seldom made a serious challenge for a major trophy — although they did reach the 1960 FA Cup final when managed by Scot Dally Duncan. Rovers lost this game 3–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers after playing most of the game with only 10 men on the field. Full back Dave Whelan was lost during the game to a broken leg, the game being played in the days before substitutes were allowed. Despite losing, cup final man of the match was future Scotland manager Ally MacLeod (left winger MacLeod scored 47 goals in 193 appearances for Rovers). During the 1960s Blackburn Rovers had several players who made it into national teams. They were again relegated from the First Division in 1966 and began a 26-year exile from the top division.
1970s and 1980s: More frustration.
During the 1970s, Blackburn Rovers bounced between the Second and Third Divisions, winning the Third Division title in 1975, but never mounted a challenge for promotion to the First Division despite the efforts of successive managers to put the club back on track. They went up as runners up in the Third Division in 1980 and have remained in the upper two tiers of the English league ever since. In 1988–89 they mounted their first serious promotion challenge for many years, and reached the Second Division playoff final in its last-ever season of the home-away two-legged format — but lost to Crystal Palace. A defeat in the 1989–90 Second Division playoff semi-finals brought more frustration to Ewood Park, but the following season saw the club taken over by local steelworks owner and lifelong supporter Jack Walker (1929–2000).
1990s: The Jack Walker revolution.
Back at the top (1991–1994).
Jack Walker's takeover was too late to save Rovers from finishing 19th in the Second Division at the end of the 1990–91 season, but the new owner had made money available to spend on new players. Blackburn Rovers began the 1991–92 season with Don Mackay still manager, but he was soon sacked to make way for Kenny Dalglish. Dalglish made several substantial signings during the season. After his appointment Rovers climbed the league, but later lost six games in a row, causing them to fall out of the play-off places, but Rovers fought back and a 3–1 victory at Plymouth got Rovers to the final play off place. The club reached the play-off final at Wembley where they beat Leicester City 1–0 thanks to a Mike Newell penalty.
Rovers made headlines in the summer of 1992 by paying an English record fee of £3.5million for the 22-year-old Southampton and England centre forward Alan Shearer. Other expensive signings during the 1992–93 season included Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux, Middlesbrough winger Stuart Ripley and Coventry striker Kevin Gallacher. An impressive Blackburn side remained in the title challenge for most of the season before finishing fourth in the final table, that season not quite enough for UEFA Cup place. Leeds midfielder David Batty and Southampton goalkeeper Tim Flowers were two key signings who helped Blackburn progress in 1993–94 and finish Premiership runners-up to Manchester United. Rovers broke the English transfer fee record again a few weeks later when paying Norwich City £5million for 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton.
Premiership Champions (1994–1995).
Blackburn won the Premier League in 1994–95.
Ray Harford era (1995–1997).
Kenny Dalglish moved upstairs to the position of Director of Football at the end of the championship season, and handed over the reins to his assistant Ray Harford (1945–2003).
Blackburn Rovers made a poor start to the 1995–96 season, and found themselves in the bottom half for most of the first half of the season. Rovers also struggled in the Champions League and finished bottom of their group with just four points. A 7–0 victory over Nottingham Forest on the day of the official opening of the redeveloped Ewood Park and a 4–1 win over Rosenborg (including a nine-minute Mike Newell hat-trick, which is still the fastest hat-trick in Champions League history) were two highlights of an otherwise disappointing seasons. Alan Shearer was instrumental again, becoming the first striker to score more than 30 Premiership goals in three successive seasons. Blackburn Rovers improved as the season went on, finishing seventh in the Premiership and narrowly missing out on a UEFA Cup place.
Alan Shearer was top goalscorer at Euro 96 and was linked to domestic and international clubs. The main talk in the national media was of Shearer joining hated rivals Manchester United. Blackburn Rovers, Alan Shearer (many Rovers fans didn't forgive Shearer for several years due to his denials) and the Lancashire Evening Telegraph constantly slammed the rumours especially the links with Manchester United. Local journalist Peter White stated that the club should never be forgiven should Shearer be allowed to join Manchester United.
However Shearer was sold to hometown club Newcastle United for a then world record fee of £15million in the summer of 1996, and Rovers were unable to find a suitable replacement.
It was clear that while Shearer was allowed to join Newcastle that Jack Walker would never have allowed him to join Manchester United. The chairman of Manchester United, Martin Edwards admitted this.
A terrible start to the 1996–97 Premiership campaign saw Harford resign in late October with the club bottom of the division, having failed to win any of their first ten games. Relegation looked a real possibility, just two seasons after winning the league. The club immediately began the process of recruiting his replacement. Meanwhile caretaker manager Tony Parkes turned the club's fortunes around and they eventually finished in a secure 13th place in the final table.
On 16 December 1996 with Rovers hovering above the relegation zone, it was announced at an Ewood Park press conference that Sven-Göran Eriksson had signed an "unconditional contract" with Rovers to take over as manager at the end of the season on 1 July 1997 when his contract with Italian Serie A club U.C. Sampdoria expired.
It was hoped that the signing of Eriksson would usher in a new era of success after the continuing difficulties following Ray Harford's disappointing tenure as manager. "Not only do I want us to be a top club in this country, I want European football to be the norm for us", said club owner Jack Walker. "If we get support as high as we want it and the public back us in every way they can then we could even consider the Walkersteel Stand".
Renewed hope and downfall (1997–1999).
They were relegated in 1998-99.
The new millennium.
Fighting for a comeback.
They were promoted back to the Premier League in 2000–01.
Return and cup glory.
In 2001–02, the club marked their first season back in the Premiership with a tenth-place finish and their record signing, an £8m swoop for Manchester United's Andy Cole. More significantly, Blackburn Rovers won their first-ever League Cup by beating Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff — where Cole proved his worth by scoring the winning goal in the 69th minute after Matt Jansen had put Rovers in front. The Jansen and Cole partnership excited the Ewood Park faithful after the latter's arrival in January, and both were disappointed not to make the 2002 England World Cup squad. Before the season began, Turkish playmaker Tugay Kerimoğlu, Italian hotshot Corrado Grabbi and full back Lucas Neill were signed to strengthen an already solid squad. With David Dunn and Damien Duff both shining, the season was a memorable one.
2003–2004: Setback.
At the start of 2003–04 the sale of fan favourites Damien Duff and David Dunn meant that Rovers were always going to struggle to emulate the previous season's form, and there was anger from fans at their sales. In particular, Dunn, who had demanded a transfer after falling out with his manager.
2004–2008: Return of the Spark.
Souness left just after the start of 2004–05 to take charge at Newcastle. Rovers appointed Welsh national coach Mark Hughes as his successor, a key player in the club's promotion and League Cup successes a few seasons earlier. Hughes secured Rovers Premiership survival for the 2004–05 season as well as an FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, with Rovers finishing 15th once again, with Hughes's arrival coinciding with the team becoming one of the most solid teams in the league, thanks to astute signings such as Ryan Nelsen and Aaron Mokoena, and good motivational skills. He was able to strengthen the setup for 2005–06 with the £3.2 million transfer of much sought-after Wales international striker Craig Bellamy from Newcastle United. Following a 1–0 victory over league champions Chelsea F.C., Blackburn Rovers secured the 6th place in the league and a spot in the UEFA Cup for the 2006–07 season — their third European qualification in five years, and their sixth foray into Europe since 1994. Striker Craig Bellamy repaid the faith shown in him by Hughes, as he scored 17 goals, 13 in the league in only 22 starts, including vital goals in the 3–2 wins over Middlesbrough and the 2–2 draw at Portsmouth. Morten Gamst Pedersen, who was signed by Graeme Souness but nurtured by Hughes to become a star, shined and attracted interest from a number of big teams for his performances and set pieces, including his two goals that won the game in a historic 2–1 win over arch rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford.
After qualifying for Europe, Rovers signed South African striker Benni McCarthy from Porto as a replacement for the departed Craig Bellamy. Rovers finished top of their European group and were drawn against Bayer Leverkusen, losing 3–2 on aggregate. The club was busy during the January transfer window, signing David Dunn, Stephen Warnock, Christopher Samba and Bruno Berner. Leaving the squad were Dominic Matteo, Andy Taylor (loan), Joe Garner (loan), Lucas Neill and Jay McEveley. In cup competitions, Rovers were knocked out of the Carling Cup in the Third Round. They defeated Everton, Luton, Arsenal (after replay) and Manchester City in the FA Cup. Thereafter, they faced Chelsea for a place in the final, losing 2–1 when Michael Ballack scored Chelsea's winner in extra time. Rovers finished the season 10th in the league, with McCarthy netting 18 league goals. The club also qualified for the Intertoto Cup and drew Lithuanian side FK Vetra of Vilnius.
To prepare for the 2007–08 season Rovers bought Roque Santa Cruz, Maceo Rigters and Gunnar Nielsen. In the January 2008 transfer window, Robbie Savage left for Derby in a £1.5m (rising to £2m) transfer to seek first team football. Rovers were never at any stage during the season outside the top ten and made their best start to a campaign for 10 years and Santa Cruz brilliantly shone scoring 23 goals in all competitions.
Ince and Allardyce (since 2008).
After the 2007–08 season, Mark Hughes released three senior players who were out of contract — defenders Stéphane Henchoz and Bruno Berner and goalkeeper Peter Enckelman.
Paul Ince, who took Milton Keynes Dons to the League Two title in 2007–08, was also linked with the manager's job. On 19 June, BBC Sport revealed that Paul Ince was set to replace Hughes as Blackburn manager. In the final few days of the selection process it was also revealed that Michael Laudrup was interested in the job. On 22 June 2008, it was officially confirmed by the Blackburn Rovers Website/club, that Paul Ince had indeed been brought in to manage Rovers, signing a three-year deal at the club. Ince was presented to the media on Tuesday 24 June. Ince's first job though as the Blackburn Manager is to persuade some of the wantaway players to stay. On 4 July, Paul Ince signed experienced coach Archie Knox, who will be taking over as 1st team coach for the oncoming season.
Before the start of the 2008–09 season, regular goalkeeper Brad Friedel and England international winger David Bentley left the club. Goalkeeper Paul Robinson then became Ince's first signing on 25 July for a fee of £3.5 million.
Ince's reign as Blackburn Rovers manager got off to the perfect start, with a 3–2 away win against Everton FC in the first game to the 2008–09 season. Blackburn drew 1–1 at home to Hull City before two heavy defeats to West Ham and Arsenal. They bounced back well and recorded back-to-back wins against Fulham and Newcastle United, but faded drastically: three draws and seven defeats, including five defeats in a row to saw Blackburn slip to 19th in the table after 16 games. This led to Ince coming under increasing pressure: he enjoyed some success in the Carling Cup, with wins over Everton and Sunderland. Eventually Ince paid the price for poor results, and a 3–0 defeat away to Wigan saw him sacked a few days later. He was replaced by the former Bolton manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce secured Premier League survival, and despite a difficult start to the 2009–10 season Rovers recovered well in the second half of the campaign to secure a comfortable 10th place finish with 50 points — placing them 20 points clear of the relegation zone.
Club takeover.
In January 2008, the Dan Williams-led consortium interested in taking the club over withdrew interest. The club are prepared to sell and other groups are still interested.
On Sunday 20 April 2008, Blackburn Rovers were yet again linked with another consortium led bid. This time from new JJB Sports owner Chris Ronnie, and an Icelandic based consortium. Whether this will lead to a formal bid being presented to the Walker Trustees, is still yet to be seen.
On Sunday 8 June 2008, Blackburn Rovers were again linked to Chris Ronnie's consortium in the National Press. In which the Sunday People reported "Chris Ronnie is closing in on his takeover of Blackburn Rovers", the article also went on to say "Ronnie has had four (4) meetings with Rothschilds, the financiers selling the club for the Jack Walker Trustees, and there has been 'significant progress."
Whether or not any takeover of the club results from this will become very clear within the next 4 weeks from 8 June to 8 July.
On 6 July, it was revealed that Chris Ronnie had pulled out of a bid to buy the club, and that Chowdery had a bid of £30 million rejected.

Wolff Jakob Lauffensteiner

Wolff Jakob Lauffensteiner (1676–1754) was an eminent Austrian lutenist active in the Bavarian court where he spent much of his career in service to the Elector of Bavaria in Munich. Some of Lauffensteiner's compositions for lute have survived.
Lauffensteiner was born in Steyr. Only his baptism date is known - 28 April 1676. He died in Munich on 26 March 1754. His father, who bore the same name, was the towerkeeper in Steyr.
About 1709 he had obtained a position of a lutenist in Graz, and from 1712 he was in the service of the Bavarian court. In 1715 he entered the private service of the Duke Ferdinand. In 1739, on the duke's death, he was granted a pension. He was later appointed a chamber counsellor ("Hofkammerrat") by the Duke Clemens August, Archbishop of Cologne, for his services to the electoral House of Bavaria.
Lauffensteiner's extant works for both solo lute and chamber ensembles typically take the forms of suite or partita. His music is generally highly idiomatic for the lute, in the German style (i.e. uniting traditional French forms, textures and ornaments with Italianate cantabile melody over a basso continuo line. In total over 100 movements survive.
Lauffensteiner is seen as a stylistic precursor to Silvius Leopold Weiss, to whom his music is frequently misattributed in manuscript sources – illustrative of its high quality in the estimation of his contemporaries.

Lebanese migration to Paraguay

The arrival of immigrants of Lebanese origin to Paraguay consisted of a large number of people who have settled in this country, bringing their customs and way of life. 
Many were the reasons which prompted these people to leave their native Lebanon and migrate to several Latin American countries, with the aim to seek a better quality of life after the World War I and Second World War 
Background.
After the First World War it passed to the hands of the French, from which it gained its independence on October 22, 1943, even though it declared its independence, the actions of the Second World War did not allow that this were fully effective until 1946. 
The intervention of Lebanon in the Arab-Israeli War 1948, its moral support to the Arabs in the Arab-Israeli War of Six Days (1967) and the arrival in the country of many Palestinians, have meant a constant hostility with neighboring Israel, first in 1970 and then in 1982, triggering the latter occasion in a bout in Beirut, which did not cease until the departure from Lebanon of Palestinian guerrillas. This situation resulted from immigration of many Lebanese in the late nineteenth century and the beginning of the century in search of a better perspective of life. With effort they managed to succeed in a different society from their culture. 
The immigration of the Lebanese to Paraguay can be divided into two eras: ancient and modern. Among the reasons which prompted the uprooting are included both the political reason, and also the economic one. 
The political reason responds to the need to escape the troubled relations that have emerged during the Ottoman Empire in the region. 
The economic reason lies in the many disappointments and poverty, the consequences of World War I. 
In a second term after the Second World War, where thousands of people, mostly men, took the decision to leave the mother homeland because of the havoc that the war had caused. 
In this journey towards finding a better future, they had to undertake long voyages in boats, often without knowing where they embark and disembark where it was even worse. In these trips they had to deal with many troubles, diseases and nostalgia. They were forced to withstand natural disasters of all kinds in the middle of the sea.
Arrival to Paraguay.
The first destination where they got was the harbor in Buenos Aires Argentina to which they arrived without even speaking Spanish and without knowing its customs. But they did not take much to adapt and strive to rebuild a decent life, forming households and having children without forgetting their roots. 
They were organized in groups and communities, in order to find the best place to settle. Following trips by rivers or on trains until they came to Paraguay and then distributed in various places of the country where trade could be a prominent occupation.
They settle in Asuncion, the country's capital, and also in Concepcion, Puerto Rosario, Villarrica, Itacurubi del Rosario, Encarnacion, San Estanislao, Pedro Juan Caballero, Caraguatay and other cities. Mixing with Paraguayan society and after much effort and work they could open shops, factories or cultivate the land. 
They dedicated not only learn the Castilian but also the Guaraní, they fought in the Chaco War, participated with their civilization and helped building the country. Joined their lives in marriage to men and women of Paraguay, respected the cultural identity of the country that hosted them. They taught their children the values of love for the two cultures, which created clubs and associations which still preserve their traditions. 
The last major contingent of immigrants arrived in Paraguay in the late 60 and early 70.
The majority of Lebanese-Paraguayans are Christians who belong to the Maronite Church, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches. A scant number are Muslims.
In addition to being of Lebanese descent, there are Paraguayans of Syrian and Palestinian origin as well.
Surnames.
Many Arab surnames from Lebanon today stand out in Paraguayan society as political leaders and national authorities, businessmen, writers and people dedicated to the arts in general. 
Some of these surnames were modified to improve their pronunciation in Spanish, but many retain their original identity. 
The most common are; Aboud, Aid, Armel, Arar, Rossi, Atat, Ayala, Azar, Barchini, Buzarquis, Canan / Kanan, Nader, Cofure, Curi / Kuri / Juri, Daher, Damus, Diaz, Dibb, Elias, Esgaib / Zgaib, Esquef / Skef, Fadlala, Fadul, Farah, Garcia, Ghobril, Giral, Gosen, Haddad, Haitter / Haidar, Harare, Host, Ismael / Ysmail, Kalfat, Mohur, Maluff, Mancos, Mende, Musi, Ouchana, Rahi, Resck / Risk, Rosas, Sabag, Safua, Sardi, Seif din, Serrano, Yambay / Yampey, Yanho, Yauhari, Yore, Yunis.

Alien (band)

Alien is a Swedish rock band formed in Gothenburg in 1986 by guitarist Tony Borg and vocalist Jim Jidhed. They are best known today for their single "Only One Woman", a cover of a Marbles song, and "Brave New Love", which was featured in the 1988 remake of "The Blob".
History.
Early success (1986-88).
Borg and Jidhed's original lineup included Ken Sandin on bass guitar, Jimmy Wandroph on keyboards, and Toby Tarrach on drums. This group released the single "Only One Woman" in 1988, a cover of a song written by the Bee Gees and first recorded by The Marbles in 1968. The Alien cover reached #1 in Sweden and remained there for six weeks.
Later in 1988, Alien released their first, eponymous album, including "Only One Woman" as well as "Brave New Love" and "Tears Don't Put Out the Fire", which was released as a single later that year. In 1989, the band released a re-worked version of it for the US/international market, again titled "Alien". This album included eight out of the twelve tracks released in the 1988 album, 5 of which were remixed. Two new tracks were added, "Now Love" being one and a cover of "The Air That I Breathe" the other, both sung by new vocalist Peter "Pete" Sandberg.
Shiftin' Gear (1988-93).
In the fall of 1988, Jidhed left the band to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Peter Sandberg, formerly frontman for the bands Madison and Von Rosen. In 1990 the band also made other changes, such as replacing Wandroph and Tarrach with Bert Andersson on keyboards and Imre Duan on drums. This was the lineup for the band's release of its third album, ""Shiftin' Gear"". However, the album was not the success it was predicted to be and another major lineup change occurred. Andersson was replaced by Richard Andre on keyboards and Stefan Ridderstrale replaced Duan on drums. Former Madison bassist Conny Payne also joined Alien in 1993. Finally, lead singer Peter Sandberg departed the band and later pursued a solo career. To replace him, Alien recruited Daniel Zangger Borch.
Band Stability (1993-2005).
Alien returned to the studios to record their fourth album, again titled ""Alien"". Ridderstrale, although performing on tour, did not participate in the recording sessions and Michael Wilkman stood in as drummer. Production was weak and the band lost much of its following. This can also be attributed to the numerous band member changes between 1990 and 1993.
Ridderstrale officially left the band in 1995 and Staffan Scharrin became the drummer, thus completing the band's present lineup. This new formation released the band's fifth album, ""Crash"" in 1995. This album featured heavier metal songs than previously recorded by Alien.
Since then, Alien released three more albums, "Best and Rare" (1997, compilation), "Live in Stockholm 1990" (2001) and "Dark Eyes" (2005). Dark Eyes was the first album to feature all new recordings and marked the return of Jim Jidhed to the band now composed of him, Mats Sandborgh on keyboards, Berndt Ek on bass, Jan Lundberg on drums alongside Tony Borg.
Present days (2010-).
Alien has finally reunited with the complete original lineup. They are touring during 2010 and will be releasing a new single in October this year - 'Ready To Fly'. The band is about to release their long awaited new studio album in April 2014 through Germany based label AOR HEaven.

La Ghriba

La Ghriba is a picturesque documentary about the 2,500-year-old Jewish community on the Tunisian island of Jerba, where Jews and Muslims live side-by-side peacefully.
Summary.
According to local tradition, the first Jews settled on Jerba in the wake of the first Temple’s destruction in Jerusalem in 566 BCE. A community with true foundations in the Jewish life of the ancients, island tradition holds that its synagogue -– known as La Ghriba (“the miraculous”) — is built with a stone from the ruins of the First Temple, and houses the oldest known Sefer Torah in its sanctuary.
Waves of Jewish immigrants from around the Mediterranean flocked to it as a haven from persecution in the millennia that followed the original settlement. Upon arrival, they were greeted with a Jewish community that existed in surprising harmony with its local Muslim Berber neighbors.
Along their valued status as fully Tunisian, Jerba’s Jews maintain a strong pride in their Judaism, and they revel in showing it. The film captures a yearly festival held just outside La Ghriba, commemorating two famous rabbis. The occasion is one of music and dancing, and helps continue the tradition of drawing Jews from around the world to Jerba –- if only for a visit. Such visitors have the reputation of leaving the island with a future husband or wife in town.
And yet, the Jewish community is so utterly suffused with its Tunisian culture, that it is outwardly almost indistinguishable. Repeated shots of the wide variety of Jerba’s residents reveal just how much both Jew and non-Jew in this millennia-old community share similarities in both physical appearance and their shared Arabic and French language.
But they retain individualizing brands of orthodoxy when it comes to their respective religions. Even though both communities share a love for couscous, vegetable dumplings and potato soup, because many of Jerba’s Jews keep strictly kosher, they rarely share meals with Muslim neighbors.

Richard Lyons (Dean of Haas School of Business)

Richard Kent Lyons is the 14th Dean of the Haas School of Business, U.C. Berkeley. Prior to becoming Dean in July 2008, he served as the Chief Learning Officer at Goldman Sachs in New York, a position he had held since 2006.
Biography.
Lyons was born on February 10, 1961 in Palo Alto, CA, USA. Lyons earned his BS in Business with highest honors from U.C. Berkeley in 1982. In 1987 he received his PhD in Economics from MIT. Before working at Goldman Sachs, Lyons served as Acting Dean of the Haas School from 2004 to 2005 and as Executive Associate Dean and Sylvan Coleman Professor of Finance from 2005 to 2006. Before coming to Haas, Lyons also spent six years on the faculty at Columbia Business School. His teaching expertise is in international finance. Lyons is fluent in French and is also an accomplished musician, owning several musical copyrights. He and his wife, Jennifer, have two children.
Research.
Lyons’ early research focuses on currency markets, a focus reflected in his recent book “The Microstructure Approach to Exchange Rates” (MIT Press). This novel approach to exchange rates examines the market from a trading-room perspective, e.g., the flow of buy and sell orders and why those orders subsequently affect prices, rather than from the traditional perspective of macroeconomics. This line of work focuses on how dispersed information gets reflected in prices via trading. He has published numerous articles on these and other related topics. Recently, his research has taken a quite different tack, namely, exploring the links between leadership and innovation in organizations.
Teaching.
Lyons is also a highly respected educator and a popular professor: in 1998 he received U.C. Berkeley’s highest teaching honor, the Distinguished Teaching Award, and has won the Haas School’s Teacher of the Year (Cheit) award six times.
Other Professional Activities.
Lyons' past consulting relationships include the Federal Reserve Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and Citibank. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, an Associate Editor of the "California Management Review", and, prior to joining Goldman Sachs, served as Chair of the Board of Directors of Matthews Asia Funds, and a member of the Board of Directors of iShares (Barclays Global Investors). Lyons continues to serve as Faculty Director for U.C. Berkeley’s Blum Center for Developing Economies.

<doc id="18620088" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18620088" title="Hydrogen safety">
Hydrogen safety

Hydrogen safety covers the safe production, handling and use of hydrogen. Hydrogen poses unique challenges due to its ease of leaking, low-energy ignition, wide range of combustible fuel-air mixtures, buoyancy, and its ability to embrittle metals that must be accounted for to ensure safe operation. Liquid hydrogen poses additional challenges due to its increased density and the extremely low temperatures needed to keep it in liquid form.
Hydrogen is used as a feedstock in industrial processes including production of ammonia and methanol, and cooling electric generators in power stations.
Summary.
Although hydrogen has many useful properties, some have serious safety implications:
On the other hand, in the context of safety, hydrogen's considerable buoyancy and lack of toxicity other than as an asphyxiant work in its favor.
Hydrogen codes and standards.
Hydrogen codes and standards are codes and standards (RCS) for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, stationary fuel cell applications and portable fuel cell applications.
Additional to the codes and standards for hydrogen technology products, there are codes and standards for hydrogen safety, for the safe handling of hydrogen and the storage of hydrogen.
Guidelines.
The current ANSI/AIAA standard for hydrogen safety guidelines is AIAA G-095-2004, Guide to Safety of Hydrogen and Hydrogen Systems. As NASA has been one of the world's largest users of hydrogen, this evolved from NASA's earlier guidelines, NSS 1740.16 (8719.16). These documents cover both the risks posed by hydrogen in its different forms and how to ameliorate them.
Liquid hydrogen.
Liquid Hydrogen requires complex storage technology such as the special thermally insulated containers and requires special handling common to all cryogenic substances. This is similar to, but more severe than liquid oxygen. Even with thermally insulated containers it is difficult to keep such a low temperature, and the hydrogen will gradually leak away. (Typically it will evaporate at a rate of 1% per day.)
Prevention.
Hydrogen collects under roofs and overhangs, where it forms an explosion hazard; any building that contains a potential source of hydrogen should have good ventilation, strong ignition suppression systems for all electric devices, and preferably be designed to have a roof that can be safely blown away from the rest of the structure in an explosion. It also enters pipes and can follow them to their destinations. Hydrogen pipes should be located above other pipes to prevent this occurrence. Hydrogen sensors allow for rapid detection of hydrogen leaks to ensure that the hydrogen can be vented and the source of the leak tracked down. As in natural gas, an odorant can be added to hydrogen sources to enable leaks to be detected by smell. While hydrogen flames can be hard to see with the naked eye, they show up readily on UV/IR flame detectors.
Accidents.
Hydrogen has been portrayed in the popular press as a relatively more dangerous fuel, and hydrogen in fact has the widest explosive/ignition mix range with air of all gases except acetylene. However this is mitigated by the fact that hydrogen rapidly rises and disperses before ignition, and unless the escape is in an enclosed, unventilated area, it is unlikely to be serious.
Demonstrations have shown that a fuel fire in a hydrogen-powered vehicle can burn out completely with little damage to the vehicle, in stark contrast to the expected result in a gasoline-fueled vehicle.
In a more recent event, an explosion of compressed hydrogen during delivery at the Muskingum River Coal Plant (owned and operated by AEP) caused significant damage and killed one person.
For more information on incidents involving hydrogen, visit the US DOE's Hydrogen Incident Reporting and Lessons Learned page.
During the 2011 Fukushima nuclear emergency, four reactor buildings were damaged by hydrogen explosions. Exposed Zircaloy cladded fuel rods became very hot and react with steam, releasing hydrogen. Safety devices that normally burn the generated hydrogen failed due to loss of electric power. To prevent further explosions, vent holes were opened in the top of the remaining reactor buildings.

Circumcise Me

Circumcise Me is a 2008 film about the American-born Israeli comedian Yisrael Campbell.
It was produced by Matthew Kalman, foreign news correspondent in Jerusalem for "USA Today", Canada's "Globe & Mail" and other newspapers, and David Blumenfeld, an Israel-based photographer who has photographed for "Time", "Newsweek" and other publications.
The film, originally screened under the title "It's Not in Heaven: The Comedy of Yisrael Campbell", is about a Catholic convert to Judaism who has become a stand-up comedy star in Israel. Campbell's routine riffs on the fact that he converted to Judaism three times, once Reform, once Conservative and once Orthodox.
"The Economist" calls the film "hilarious and moving".
The film has been screened in Toronto and Jerusalem, and is scheduled to be released in the United States autumn 2008.

Augustus Frederick Sherman

Augustus Frederick Sherman worked as a clerk at Ellis Island in the years 1892-1925. He was an untrained, yet highly gifted photographer who created hundreds of images documenting the new arrivals to America. Fascinated by the diverse origins and cultural backgrounds of his subjects, Sherman created a riveting series of portraits, offering viewers a compelling perspective on this dynamic period in American history.
Very little is known about Sherman. Born on July 9, 1865, in Lynn, Pennsylvania, he was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Hired by the Bureau of Immigration to work as a clerk at Ellis Island in 1892, eight years after having moved to New York, he rose through the clerical ranks. Considering the state of the art of photography in that era, with long exposures and huge box cameras, the fact he was able to capture so many images during his working life is amazing.
For many, Ellis Island is the ultimate symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience. On July 4, 2008, the Minnesota History Center opened a new exhibit celebrating the human story of the more than twelve million immigrants who entered the United States through the federal immigration station.
The exhibit features 75 framed black-and-white photographs reflecting the cultural and ethnic diversity of people arriving at the beginning of the 20th century. Sherman took photographs of families, groups, and individuals who were being detained either for medical reasons or for further interrogation. In many cases, the subjects were fleeing poverty, natural disaster, and political and religious persecution. And sometimes, after being detained, the immigrant was deported. Over the course of his career at Ellis Island, Sherman took more than 200 pictures, often encouraging his subjects to open their suitcases and put on their elaborate national costumes or folk dress. He captured images of Romanian shepherds, German stowaways, circus performers and women from Guadeloupe.

The Henpecked Duck

The Henpecked Duck is a Warner Bros. cartoon released in theatres in 1941, directed by Bob Clampett and featuring Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. The film is set in a court room, where Daffy tries to save his marriage after losing his wife's egg.
Plot.
Porky Pig presides as judge over divorce proceedings at the "Court of Inhuman Relations." He calls the case of "Duck vs. Duck." Daffy and Mrs. Duck approach the judge's stand. Mrs. Duck shouts over and over: "I want a divorce!"
Porky asks her to relate to the court what happened. She explains that she had left Daffy in charge of keeping their egg warm while she visited her mother. Daffy grew bored, so he took the egg and performed a magic trick, causing the egg to disappear and then reappear. Impressed with himself, he tried the trick a second time but was unable to make the egg reappear. Despite countless frantic attempts with his trick, the egg never reappeared. When Mrs. Duck returned home, Daffy had replaced the egg with a door knob, hoping to fool her. She discovers this, and ends her story by shouting "I want a divorce!" once more, but this time, not in a blind rage, but extremely close to tears.
Porky then sternly asks Daffy what he has to say for himself. Daffy pleads for one more chance, and Porky grants his request. In tears, he tries the trick again and the egg reappears, much to the court's shock. The egg immediately hatches and the Ducks reconcile their differences. Junior, seated on the judge's podium with his glasses and Porky's gavel, then says, "Case dismissed, step down!", hitting the gavel twice at the end of the cartoon.

Achille-Louis Foville

Achille-Louis Foville (1799 – June 22, 1878) was a French neurologist and psychiatrist. He produced the first description of the terminal stria.
Life.
Foville was born in Pontoise, France and received his medical doctorate in 1824, after studying medicine under Léon Louis Rostan and Jean Étienne Dominique Esquirol at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. His medical thesis argued mental illness may be curable, discussing some treatments of the day and their apparent effectiveness. The next year, he was made the medical superintendent of the Saint-Yon asylum in Rouen. During his time there he published several papers on disorders of the nervous system which were well received. His son Achille-Louis-François Foville was born in 1831. He remained at the asylum until 1833, when ill health forced his resignation.
Foville spent time travelling abroad, to Africa and America. He returned to France, settling in Paris. After the death of his former teacher Esquirol in 1840, Foville was made a professor at Charenton. Until the appointment Thomas Hodgkin had been attempting to open a facility for the treatment of mental illnesses to compete with the York Retreat. With Foville's appointment to Charenton, he was no longer willing to relocate to England, and Hodgkin dropped the project, feeling no other doctors were suitable to run the facility. 
The French Revolution of 1848 cost him his job at Charenton, and Foville took up private practice in Paris. He practised medicine in Paris, treating mental disorders, until 1868, when he retired. He moved to Toulouse after his retirement, where he died in 1878.
Works.
In 1844 Foville published "Traité complet de l'anatomie, de la physiologie et de la pathologie du système nerveux cérébro-spinal" on the anatomy of the nervous system of the spinal cord, regarded as one of the best works on the subject prior to the invention of the microscope.

Sainsbury family

The Sainsbury family (also Lord Sainsbury and family and incorrectly the Sainsbury's family) founded Sainsbury's, the UK's second-largest supermarket chain. Today, the family has many interests, including business, politics, philanthropy, arts, and sciences.
Principal members of the Sainsbury family.
Principal members of the founding family of the UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's are:
Family involvement in Sainsbury’s.
No family member now works for the company, although John Davan Sainsbury is the Life President of the firm.
The last family member to work for the company was Tim Sainsbury who retired as a non-executive director in 1999. The last family chairman was David Sainsbury who retired as chairman of the company in 1998. This brought to an end 129 years of management of the group by the Sainsbury family. As a government minister since 1998, his shares were held in a blind trust until 2007.
Family shareholding in Sainsbury’s.
The equity interest in Sainsbury’s held by the family as of May 2011 is just 15%. The family sold down their stake from 35% in 2005. The largest family shareholders are Lord Sainsbury of Turville with 4.99% and Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, who controls just under 3% of the company, and benefits from 1.6% of the equity included in the above. The Sunday Times reported in September 2006 that "The Sainsbury family continues to shares in the £6.2 billion retailer... and for the first time their combined holding has fallen below 20%.”
The largest shareholder is now the Qatar Investment Authority (the investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family of the Gulf Kingdom) who as of May 2011 holds 25.999% of the company.
Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover's decision to split his 3.89% holding in Sainsbury's between other members of his family in December 2006 suggests that the family may not have sold as many shares as previously thought. The other theory could be that the most senior members of the family, with previous stakes of over 3% (the reportable stock exchange shareholding threshold), could have simply transferred some of their shares to their children (who previously held few shares), rather than having sold shares onto the open market. However, some shares which have been sold were definitely sold to the open market (according to Miss Judith Portrait, the trustee for many Sainsbury family settlements).
This fall from around 35% increases the possibility of any takeover attempt succeeding. However, the Sainsbury family have managed to use their remaining stake to block takeover bids in the past, as demonstrated by the two failed takeover bids in 2007. A hostile bid for the company may encounter difficulties, without the full support of the Sainsbury family. The halving of the generous dividend yield in recent years may have been a significant factor regarding the family's decision to reduce their shareholdings.
Buildings set up by the Sainsbury family.
The Sainsbury family has also set up a number of buildings, to house their various interests. These are:
The Sainsbury family charitable interests.
Eighteen of the grant-making trusts set up by members of the Sainsbury family, are known collectively as the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts. Institutions whose creation they fostered include the following:
Annabel Sainsbury (married name Annabel Kanabus) set up, with her husband, the international AIDS charity AVERT, and the charity GHE. Adrian Kanabus has set up Adrians Charity.
Celia Sainsbury (married name Celia Blakey) set up the Celia Blakey Charitable Trust which makes grants to various other charities.
The Sainsbury family are also major benefactors to English Heritage and the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.
Sainsbury family interests in politics.
The Sainsbury family also has varying political interests.

Home of Lotta Crabtree

The Home of Lotta Crabtree is located in downtown Grass Valley, California at 238 Mill Street.
History.
Lotta's father, John Crabtree, arrived to Grass Valley in the early 1850s as part of the California Gold Rush. Lotta and her mother joined him in 1853. The Crabtrees, British immigrants, ran their home as a boarding house for the miners, many of whom were Cornish. Lotta, then age six, caught the attention of her neighbor, the internationally acclaimed singer and dancer Lola Montez, whose home (later, a historical landmark) was on the same street. Lotta moved away in 1856, later becoming a wealthy and beloved American entertainer of the late 19th century.
Landmark.
This Nevada County building is honored as California Historical Landmark No. 293, registered in 15 August 1938. The plaque's inscription states:
Home of Lotta Crabtree
Lotta Crabtree was born in New York in 1847. In 1852-3 the gold fever brought her family to California. Several months after arriving in San Francisco, Mrs. Crabtree and Lotta went to Grass Valley and with Mr. Crabtree started a boarding house for miners. It was here that Lotta met Lola Montez, who taught her to sing and dance. In Scales, Plumas County, Lotta made her first public appearance, which led to a successful career on stage here and abroad.
The house is also listed in a database of women's history sites created by the Women's Progress Commemorative Commission.

<doc id="18620293" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18620293" title="Cherrypal">
Cherrypal

Cherrypal is a California, USA-based marketer of Chinese-manufactured consumer-oriented computers. It markets a range of models with a diversity of CPU-types, structures, features, and operating systems. Commentators have observed that Cherrypal arguably beat the heralded and much-better financed OLPC project to its goal of a $100 "laptop" (such units are physically small: a Cherrypal unit for general purchase at $99 plus shipping has a 7" screen, an OLPC provided to a child in developing world at $199 has a 7.5").
The company's business practices have generated controversy and antipathy from some vocally dissatisfied customers, while others are marginally satisfied. Its practices pertaining to merchandise returns and communication have been repeatedly faulted. The USA's Better Business Bureau rating for Cherrypal is presently an "F", indicating that the BBB strongly questions the company’s reliability.
Cherrypal claims a commitment to environmental concerns and the needs of impoverished countries and in particular key sponsorship of a learning center in Ghana. It supports a "One Laptop per Teacher" pilot program in Nigeria.
In order, the company has marketed the "C114" PPC-processor-based nettop, the "Cherrypal Bing" x86-based netbook, the "Cherrypal Africa" XBurst-CPU-based netbook, the "Cherrypal Asia" ARM-processor-based netbooks, and the "CherryPad America" ARM-processor-based tablet computer.
C114.
The Cherrypal C114 is a small, light nettop computer using a PowerPC-processor, the Freescale 5121e system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrated main-board, and Xubuntu as its operating system. The device launches Firefox Minefield web-browser, AbiWord word-processor, and other apps via icon double-click. An article in The Register noted that Cherrypal's producers asserted that the computer will consume only 2 watts of power. Independent, informal testing has shown a wattage consumption of still low 6.9 watts while booting.
The CherryPal C114 was a rebadged version of the LimePC D1 mini-desktop computer developed as part of a broader Freescale PowerPC chip-based product line by THTF's Shenzhen R&D center and shown to the public at the 2008 CES in Las Vegas in January 2008.
Bing.
The "Cherrypal Bing" is a slim x86-based netbook that ships with Windows XP.
Africa.
Cherrypal's $99 netbook, the Africa, is aimed primarily at the developing world but also available for sale to consumers. According to a blog post by Max Seybold, the device's specs in Cherrypal's web store are kept intentionally vague, because the Africa is not built to a set design. Instead, Cherrypal either purchases pre-made netbook systems or buys odd lots of whatever inexpensive components are available and builds netbooks out of these. It then rebrands these netbooks as Africas. The $99 computer was named "Africa" in honor of PAAJAF, a humanitarian services group based in Ghana, West-Africa.
Seybold states that the resulting device will at a minimum "meet" the specs listed on the website, but could also "exceed" them. It could also end up having an ARM, MIPS, "or" x86-based CPU architecture depending on what chips are available.
In an interview, Seybold stated that the Africa is not meant to be sold as a "computer" in the traditional sense, but as an "appliance" to provide Internet access to people who could not afford to buy a traditional computer. He said that with the number of government services (such as unemployment or disability) that are encouraging access by Internet, lack of such access is becoming more and more of a disability. The only thing Cherrypal promises for $99 is the ability to access the Internet.
Asia.
The "Cherrypal Asia" is a low cost ARM-based netbook that uses Android OS version 1.7.
America.
The "Cherrypal America" also known as Cherrypad is an Android tablet based upon Telechips TCC89xx ARM11 processors. Cherrypal initially sold the tablet with the promise of an upgrade to Android 2.2 by November and support for Android market. The market support has been officially removed because the tablet does not conform to the market requirements by Google. Also the Android 2.2 upgrade has been canceled, instead Cherrypal now promises an update to Android 2.3.
The hardware of the Cherrypal America as listed by Cherrypal comprises a 800 MHz ARM11 CPU by Telechips, 256 MB DDR2 RAM, 2 GB Flash Memory and a 800x480 resistive touchscreen. However there is a user report arguing some less powerful specifications according to the boot-log dumped via dmesg.
According to various Android news magazines Cherrypal has announced a successor for their current Cherrypad.
History.
Cherrypal was founded by Max Seybold based in Palo Alto. The C114 (and following C120) desktop computers were originally developed by Tsinghua Tongfang (THTF) in its Shenzhen R&D center by an engineering team led by American electronics industry veterans Jack Campbell and Ryan Quinn. An extended line of handheld, desktop, and TV-based PCs using the Freescale MPC5121e PowerPC microprocessor was shown at CES 2008 by THTF, with the desktop product picked up thereafter as an OEM purchase by CherryPal.
Cloud computing plans.
Cherrypal's marketers planned to use Firefox not only as its web-browser but also as its user interface to launch other applications such as OpenOffice.org. They planned that the Cherrypal would make use of cloud computing in which applications and storage would be wholly or in part Internet-based. These plans have not yet been implemented. The company's president asserted the cloud (Green Maraschino) would be launched in February 2010, however it is not known to have occurred.

Geomodeling Technology Corporation

Geomodeling Technology Corp. produces geoscience software for the oil and gas industry. Founded in 1996, Geomodeling has international offices and resource centers in Canada, China, Mexico, Norway, United Kingdom and USA.
History.
In 1987, Dr. Renjun Wen, Founder and Chief Technology Architect moved to Norway to pursue research interests in geostatistics and petroleum geology. As part of a post-doctorate project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in the early 1990s, Wen developed Geomodeling's core technology, SBED. Based on his research, he was contracted by Statoil Research Centre in 1996. He worked with fault analysis from seismic attributes and provided small-scale models for remaining reserves projects. The foundation of VisualVoxAt was created during this period.
At Statoil Renjun participated in an integrated reservoir characterization study called the Remaining Reserves project. The aim of the project was to explore solutions for improving oil recovery in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea fields. The reservoir asset teams knew that part of the solution was to include the effects of small-scale heterogeneity in full-field-scale reservoir models. However, available reservoir technology was unable to model the complex interlayering in the sandstone fields.
In two months, Wen developed software that could model the cross bedding and parallel bedding structures observed in the deposits. These detailed models were used to calculate the kv/kh for the reservoir units and helped to define strategies for optimal recover.
After completing his contract in the Remaining Reserves project, Wen immigrated to Canada with his wife and two children. In Calgary, Alberta, Wen saw opportunities for taking his research to the business units of major petroleum companies. With the advent of the software and an idea, Geomodeling was born.
Software.
The company offers three software products. These products have contributed to project sanction, well planning and improved drainage strategies in major petroleum companies.
SBED.
SBED technology generates geological models at centimeter- to meter-scale resolution and enables more accurate calculation of hydrocarbon reserves. SBED enables the user to model the small-scale bedding structures that impact fluid distribution. With the software's built-in upscaling function, users can integrate these small-scale effects into large-scale reservoir models and decrease the uncertainty in reservoir predictions.
SBED is software for small-scale (centimeter- to meter-scale) geological heterogeneity modeling and upscaling.
ReservoirStudio.
ReservoirStudio (formerly SBEDStudio) enables users to build scenarios by modeling the multi-scale structures and lithologies that impact fluid flow. By simulating multiple geological scenarios in SBEDStudio, users can rank the scenarios and evaluate reservoir performance with a realistic range of uncertainty. Users can refine scenarios by distributing the effective property relationships generated from SBED within SBEDStudio's property grids.
ReservoirStudio reservoir modeling software integrates well log, seismic, stratigraphic, lithofacies and petrophysical data to build realistic models for predicting reservoir production profiles and managing reservoir risk.
AttributeStudio.
AttributeStudio is Windows-based software for seismic attribute generation, visualization, calibration, classification and interpretation. AttributeStudio allows users to see beyond broadband seismic resolution and aids in extracting the right attributes.
AttributeStudio enables users to visualize data at multiple seismic resolutions and to identify the attributes that impact hydrocarbon distribution. 
Plug-ins.
Geomodeling is in the process of developing SBED and Reservoir Studio as a direct Plug-In to Schlumberger's Petrel seismic simulation software. Geomodeling’s software works with the Petrel workflow and data structure. SBED For Petrel can be used to estimate effective properties upscaled from lamina-scale models. ReservoirStudio for Petrel provides process-oriented stratigraphic layering and facies distribution.

Red Steel 2

Red Steel 2 is a first-person shooter developed by Ubisoft Paris for the Wii video game console. It is a stand-alone sequel to "Red Steel". The game was released on March 23, 2010 in North America and in Europe on March 26, 2010.
Plot.
The game begins as an unnamed Hero, the last member of the Kusagari Clan, is being dragged across the desert, tied to the back of a motorcycle. He manages to break free, but Payne, the leader of the Jackals - a vast gang of thugs, murderers and thieves - steals the Hero's katana. While running from the Jackals, the Hero rescues his old swordsmaster Jian who was to soon be executed by the Jackals. After the rescue, Jian allows the Hero to borrow his sword until the Hero can recover his own from Payne.
The Hero meets up with Tamiko, a member of his clan's research division, as well as Caldera's sheriff and Tamiko's father, Judd. They provide information for the Hero to help him track down Payne, while sabotaging the Jackals' operations in the Upper City, as well as meeting a fight club-operating businessman named Songan. The Hero eventually locates and defeats Payne in the Jackals' hideout, Rojo House, recovering his katana during the battle. He interrogates Payne and, before killing him by throwing him off a ledge, learns that his entire clan had been annihilated by a man named Shinjiro.
The Hero travels to the Lower City, encountering another rival clan called the Katakara. He finds Shinjiro in the Kusagari Temple and the two swordsmen fight. After a fierce battle, the Hero breaks Shinjiro's katana and pushes him to the edge of the Temple's roof. However, before the Hero can strike his foe down, a mysterious ninja saves Shinjiro. Jian then tells the Hero that the katanas of the Kusagari, called Sora Katanas, have great unpredictable power and that the method to make these is known only to them, and Shinjiro, who trained with the Kusagari as a child, plans to make more of them.
Following a tip from Judd, the Hero discovers Shinjiro trying to escape the city on a train and manages to board it before it leaves. After the Hero fights his way through the train, which is full of ninjas and Katakara, he finds Shinjiro atop the front car; however, the "escape attempt" is revealed to be a trap, as Shinjiro detaches the rest of the train (with the Hero on it) from his own car. Surrounded by explosives, Shinjiro then throws a grenade to destroy it. The Hero survives, but is forced to walk through the desert for three days before finding a deserted town. While exploring the town, however, the Hero discovers Songan, who explains that the ghost town is a Jackal ammo dump. The Hero drives off the Jackals and survives an attack by a Katakara force, led by the lieutenant Calhoun.
After reestablishing communications with Tamiko, Judd, and Jian, the Hero learns that the trio have tracked Shinjiro to the isolated mining community of Rattlesnake Canyon. The Hero then takes Songan's advice and uses an old locomotive in the town's deserted train depot to travel there. While exploring the Canyon, the Hero is attacked by the leader of the Katakara, Okaji, but manages to defeat him, only for him to return from the dead, ready for the Hero to fight at a later time. Following Tamiko's plan, the Hero then uses explosives stolen from the mining quarry to destroy the gate protecting Shinjiro's hideout, the Tiger's Nest. However, Songan then betrays the hero and his allies, Tamiko, Judd, and Jian, are captured. Shinjiro demands the Hero's katana in exchange for his friends. As the Hero is about to give it to him, the two engage in a gun duel, where Tamiko is shot. The Hero pursues and confronts Shinjiro who now has created a new katana. After a fierce battle, Shinjiro is defeated. As he is weakened, Shinjiro tells the hero that other clans will fight him for that katana. The Hero then thrusts his katana through Shinjiro's chest and breaks it in half, killing Shinjiro in the process. The game ends as the hero throws the other half of the katana off a cliff and looks out into the distance with Shinjiro's dead body behind him.
Characters.
The Hero: The unnamed primary protagonist of the game and referred to as "The Swordsman" and "the last Kusagari". The Hero was exiled a number of years before the game began. His master left him with a Sora katana before he was exiled. That particular katana in time turns out to be the most treasured katana of the Kusagari clan.
Jian: The swordsmaster of the Kusagari clan, he helps the main character learn new moves as the game progresses. The Hero can also gain additional techniques and upgrade his sword in the dojos where Jian takes refuge throughout the game.
Steve Judd: The town sheriff 42 years running. Having a wide collection of firearms, The Hero can purchase firearm upgrades from Judd's safehouses at certain points throughout the game.
Tamiko: A member of the Kusagari research division.
Payne: The leader of the Jackals.
Okaji: Commander of the Katakara clan warrior caste. A ruthless and cruel psychopath, Okaji can also be considered a monster for having the ability to "return from the dead". Feared by many governments, Judd remarks that Okaji has a bounty on his head in 38 different territories.
Shinjiro: The main antagonist. In the years before the game's beginning, Shinjiro was a trusted server of the Kusagari clan. He has killed every Kusagari clan member in an attempt to find the secret to making Kusagari Sora katanas which are said to contain mystical powers within each blade.
Gameplay.
"Red Steel 2" is played in a first-person perspective where players can alternate between shooting and sword fighting. Players are able to fight up to six enemies on-screen, though enemy packs can go up to twenty, and can deflect opponents' bullets with their swords. As the player progresses through the main missions (which progress the storyline), new techniques, armor and weapons become available for purchase or earning,(these can also be upgraded later, also by spending) while additional side missions are available to play, earning the player a monetary reward for their completion.
Red Steel 2 is the very first game (besides Wii Sports Resorts) to use the Wii Motion Plus Accessory. The game features an expansive amount of movement with the Wii Motion Plus allowing it to be quite an interactive game.
Development.
Development of "Red Steel 2" began in the summer of 2008. On July 28 of the same year, "Red Steel 2" was announced by Ubisoft executive director, Alain Corre. It was also confirmed to use Nintendo's new accessory, Wii MotionPlus and will be included in a bundle.
"Red Steel 2" features stylized, cel-shaded graphics, in contrast to its predecessor's more realistic aesthetic. The visual style is similar to Ubisoft Paris' own "XIII", released in 2003. The game does not include gore or excess amount of bloodshed, which resulted with "Red Steel 2" getting a rating of T. Enemies disappear in a cloud of dust as they die. Players will have at their disposal both a gun and a katana, which they can switch between at any time.
Commenting on the mix of East and West in the game creative director Jason Vandenberghe explained: "What doesn't work is to take those Western and Eastern elements, and sort of mix them into one thing. What does work is to say: here's Joe's bar and grill and here is Ming Pow's sushi's place. It's not a Western-looking cowboy katana; it's a katana, and a revolver, and they're clearly in their own place."
In April 2009, Ubisoft announced that "Red Steel 2" would not feature a multiplayer mode. Creative director Jason Vandenberghe later explained that they did explore the possibilities of a multiplayer mode, but that it would never fit in the development time window, and that they preferred to deliver a great single player experience over a mediocre multiplayer game.
Reception.
"Red Steel 2" was met with very positive reviews. It currently holds a score of 80% on Metacritic based on 73 reviews, representing favorable reviews. IGN awarded "Red Steel 2" a score of 8.6/10 along with an editor's choice award, praising the "awesome style and energetic gameplay" calling it "one of the top titles on Wii." "Official Nintendo Magazine" gave "Red Steel 2" an 86% score, praising the MotionPlus controls, visuals and audio, but criticised the mission design, referring to it as being "average." Eurogamer gave the game a score of 7/10, praising the "thrilling set pieces" but calling the game's character "flawed, certainly, but entirely honorable with it." 1up.com were considerably less impressed, giving "Red Steel 2" a C+, stating that while "occasionally exhilarating" the game was "mostly unremarkable." Gametrailers.com gave "Red Steel 2" 8.6 out of 10. GamesRadar gave the title 9 out of 10, praising the controls and "the engaging, intuitive combat." GamesRadar also noted that the game was drastically superior to "Red Steel", noting that there was "no comparison between the two." Classic Game Room received the game well. Bussler claimed that this was the best motion controlled first person shooter that "I ever played".
Ubisoft originally expected to sell 1 million copies of "Red Steel 2", but after poor sales of their game "Avatar", they slashed their sales predictions in half. According to Jason VendenBerghe at his keynote speech at the 2010 European game developers conference, Red Steel 2 has sold approximately 270,000 copies worldwide.
Sequel.
In April 2010, a French website spread a rumor that according to Nintendo magazine, "Red Steel 3" was in development.
Jason VandenBerghe feels enthusiastic about making a sequel, but in his opinion the current state of the motion control market does not yet justify making a sequel. It was reported by rumors that it would likely be a Wii-exclusive making use of the Wii Vitality Sensor.
However, since the launch of the Wii U, no further news of Red Steel 3 has surfaced. This likely indicates that this game won't come into production.

Hebrew spelling

Hebrew spelling ( , "Hebrew spelling") refers to way words are spelled in the Hebrew language. The Hebrew alphabet contains 22 letters, all of which are primarily consonants. This is because the Hebrew script is an abjad, that is, its letters indicate consonants, not vowels or syllables. An early system to overcome this, still used today, is matres lectionis, where four of these letters, Alef, He, Vav and Yud also serve as vowel letters. Later, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called niqqud, was developed.
History.
Throughout history, there have been two main systems of Hebrew spelling. One is vocalized spelling, the other is unvocalized spelling.
In vocalized spelling ("ktiv menukad"), all of the vowels are indicated by vowel points (called niqqud). In unvocalized spelling ("ktiv male"), the vowel points are omitted, but some of them are substituted by additional vowel letters (Vav and Yud). This system is the spelling system commonly used in Israel today. 
Vowel points are always optional in Hebrew. They can be used fully, partially or not used at all. The recommended approach endorsed today by the Hebrew Language Academy and other Israeli educational institutions is to use the 'plene' spelling when not adding vowel dots (which is the usual case), and place a vocalization sign on a letter only when ambiguity cannot be resolved otherwise. The 'defective' spelling is recommended for fully vocalized text, hence its use is becoming rare. Texts older than 50–60 years may be written in an unvocalized 'defective' spelling (for example, the word "ħamiším" "fifty", was written חמשים on banknotes issued by the British Mandate for Palestine or the Bank of Israel in its early days. Today, the common spelling is חמישים). A vocalized 'plene' spelling system is common in children books, when it is better to accustom the children to the more popular 'plene' spelling, while still letting them benefit from the vowel dots as a reading aid in early learning stages.
A third system that was endorsed in the past by the Hebrew Language Academy as an optimal system, but abandoned due to low popularity, calls for the use of "ħolám" (וֹ), "šurúq" (וּ), "dagéš" in "Bet", "Kaf" and "Pe" (בּ, כּ, פּ vs. ב, כ, פ), "Šin Smalít" (שׂ) and "mappíq" (הּ), while abandoning all other vowel dots (in everyday writing). According to this system, matres lectionis are still introduced to mark vowels, but the letter "Vav" is used only as a consonant, while its variants "ħolám" and "šurúq" serve as vowel letters. This system also makes clear distinction between final "He" used as a vowel marker (e.g. ילדה "a girl" ) and as a consonant (e.g. ילדהּ "her child"). This system was never extensively used, and the Hebrew Academy Language finally abandoned it in 1992, when new rules were published not assuming any use of vowel dots. 
Rules for unvocalized spelling were first issued by the Hebrew Language Committee in 1890 (which became the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 1953) and formally standardised in 1996. Even though the rules are established, some of the rules and specific spellings are disputed by writers and publishers, who often create their own in-house spelling system. Also, because having two spelling systems within the same language is confusing, some would like to reform it. In 2004, Mordechai Mishor, one of the academy's linguists, proposed in a session of the Academy of the Hebrew Language a modest reform.
Usage today.
Today, there are three systems of spelling used in Hebrew.
Usage of multiple systems.
In practice, many times two or more spelling systems are used in one text. The most common example of this is a word may be vowelized (using niqqud, the "dots") partially, for instance with אוֹמץ, where only the vav () is vowelized. This clarifies that the vowel is an "o" () and not "u" (). In addition, 3 letters (historically 6), can take a different sound depending on if there is a dot (called a dagesh) in the middle of the letter (a bet, kaf, and pei). In full spelling, the dot is not included, regardless if it is making one sound or the other. An example when a mixture of systems would be used is to clarify when the letter is taking a dagesh. An example of this, is in the picture to the right, where for the word kosher (Hebrew: כָּשֵׁר (with niqqud), כשר (full spelling), ) may be written as כּשר (a mixture of the two systems) to be unambiguous that it is the letter כּ and not כ . Words may be written in "ktiv haser" ("missing spelling") if it is unambiguous and clear enough (ex. חנכה instead of the "full" form חנוכה). In this case, the reader deciphers the word mostly by its context.
Also, some words are almost always written in the "missing" form ("ktiv haser") in everyday life: לא (, no), אמא (, mother), אם (, if), and כנרת (, Kinneret).

Whatever You Like (T.I. song)

"Whatever You Like" is a song by American recording artist T.I., released as the lead single (second overall) from his sixth studio album, "Paper Trail" (2008). The song was written by T.I., James Scheffer and David Siegel and produced by Jim Jonsin. "Whatever You Like" served as the third single from "Paper Trail" in the UK with a release date of 1 June 2009. It was named the 16th most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the "Billboard" Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. It scored T.I. his Second US No. 1.
This song is T.I.'s most successful single to date, having been on top of the charts for seven nonconsecutive weeks, and in the top 3 of the charts for over 3 total months (12 weeks). It has also been certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA.
Composition.
"Whatever You Like" was written by T.I., James Scheffer and David Siegel. The song was produced by Jim Jonsin, who produced Lil Wayne's single, "Lollipop". The production team worked on the track when T.I. was in the studio recording his album. The instrumentals for "Whatever You Like" are based on a beat of lead synthesizers and drum pattern. The song runs for 4:09 and speaks about a man who can buy a woman whatever she asks for, as well encourages the woman to ask for anything she wants. It is a slow R&B/Pop song and the chorus contains breathy soft, singing vocals. The song also contains a sample from "Redemption", the opening and closing theme song from the film "Rocky II". "Whatever You Like" is set in common time with a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute, and is written in the key of D minor with a chord progression sequence of Dm-Bb-F-C.
A second version of "Whatever You Like" was released in order to be suitable for radio stations. The original version of the track features T.I. saying "Late night sex so wet, it's so tight", while the radio version replaces these lyrics with the line "Baby I can treat you so special, so nice" in the hook and replacing the line "Thing gets so wet/ it hits so right" with "Girl, you smell so fresh, and look so nice" in the breakdown. The music video also uses the edited lyrics. Other changes include replacing the line "Tell 'em other broke niggas be quiet" with "Tell 'em other broke brothers be quiet" or "Tell 'em other broke jokers be quiet" in the pre-hook. The 2nd verse also mutes the word "brain" in the line "Brain so good/ could've sworn you went to college" due to a slang definition of the word referring to oral sex.
Critical reception.
Reviews for "Whatever You Like" were generally favorable. Jared W. Dillon of Sputnikmusic called the song a "more sophisticated take" on Lil Wayne's "Lollipop". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media noted that the song contained virtually no rapping while praising the synth-driven beat. "Blender" magazine ranked the song number 14 their Top 144 Songs of 2008 and number 18 on MTV's Commercially Released Hip-Hop Singles.
Chart performance.
"Whatever You Like" debuted at number 99 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. In its third week, it achieved the third biggest leap to number one in "Billboard" Hot 100 chart history when it jumped 70 positions, from number 71 to the top of the chart, breaking the record previously held by Maroon 5's "Makes Me Wonder", which jumped 64 to number one. It became T.I.'s first solo Hot 100 number one of his career and his second overall following the Justin Timberlake song "My Love" where T.I. was a featured artist. The song's jump can be largely attributed to huge first week digital sales of 205,000, debuting at number one on "Billboard"'s Hot Digital Songs chart. The song held the number one position on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, before being replaced by Pink's "So What." The following week the song knocked off "So What" to return to number one on the Hot 100, marking its fourth week overall at the top of the chart. It remained there for another week, marking its 5th week overall. The next week T.I. replaced himself at number one with the follow-up single "Live Your Life" which hasn't been done since Usher in 2004 with the first and second singles off his album (Yeah! and Burn). After spending two weeks at number two on the Hot 100, "Whatever You Like" again topped the chart by knocking off "Womanizer" by Britney Spears, marking its 6th non-consecutive week at number one on the Hot 100. This was the first time a song returned to number one on the chart after the artist's follow up single had already spent time at number one ("Live Your Life" having already spent a week at number one). It is also only the third song to ever have three separate runs at number one on the Hot 100, following Chic's "Le Freak" in 1979 and Leona Lewis' "Bleeding Love" earlier in 2008. The song retained the number one position the following week, bringing its total to seven non-consecutive weeks at number one. As of August 2013 it has sold 4,347,000 digital copies in the United States.
On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, "Whatever You Like" has peaked at number one, giving T.I. his thirteenth top ten on the chart, and second number one song. It has also reached number three on the Pop 100, giving T.I. his biggest solo pop hit. The song has become T.I.'s biggest radio hit as well, reaching number one on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, and number four so far on Mainstream Top 40. Overall it has topped over nine different "Billboard" charts.
Internationally, "Whatever You Like" debuted at number twenty-two on the Canadian Hot 100 and has thus far risen to number twelve. It made a strong debut on the Irish Singles Chart at number nineteen. In Australia, on the ARIA Singles Chart, it has so far peaked at number 15 and on the digital track chart at number 15. In New Zealand, the song made a massive jump from number 32 to number eight on the official RIANZ Chart. The following week it became his first number one in New Zealand and are certified by Platinum in that country. It also debuted at number sixty on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number forty-seven due to strong download sales. It will be re-released as a full CD single release on 1 June 2009 and has been added to the B-list at BBC Radio 1.
Music video.
The music video was filmed in Malibu, Los Angeles, California, and was directed by Dave Meyers. Reagan Gomez-Preston plays T.I.'s love interest. Cameos include Jackie Long, Lil Duval, Jim Jonsin, and T.I.'s girlfriend Tameka Cottle. The video starts with a girl working at a fast food restaurant. When T.I. comes into the restaurant, after ordering hot wings, he hands the girl a folded up paper with his number on it. She then calls him and T.I. invites her to his house. The video then shows her living the high life, with T.I. treating her to private jet rides, fancy dinners, and buying her many expensive gifts, such as a new car. The video also show clips of her living her normal life with her boyfriend. Right before the end of the video, it shows the release date of T.I.'s new album "Paper Trail" while T.I. is on the red carpet with his girl. At the end it is revealed it is all merely a fantasy sequence the girl was having, and T.I. had only handed the girl a hundred dollar bill, not his number. The concept of the video is similar to the one for Jay-Z's single "Excuse Me Miss".

Charles Fazzino

Charles Fazzino is an American pop artist. An innovator in the 3D pop art style, his work is exhibited in hundreds of fine art galleries worldwide.
Background.
Born in 1955, Charles Fazzino is the son of a Finnish sculptor (Irene) and an Italian mode shoe designer (Salvatore). He took his first formal art class as a 7th grader in 1967 and had his first solo art exhibition at Pelham High School in 1968. He often accompanied his mother to the arts and crafts shows in which she exhibited and in 1971, he put up his own display at the Bedford Hills Outdoor Arts Show, the first time he exhibited for the general public.
He attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and graduated with his bachelor of arts in 1977. Today, his unique, three-dimensional fine art prints and originals are sold and exhibited in hundreds of galleries and museums in more than twenty different countries around the world. He has been commissioned to create artwork for high profile events such as The Super Bowl, The GRAMMY Awards, The Pori Jazz Festival, Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Daytime Emmy Awards, and more. 
Sometimes referred to as a pop culture historian, Fazzino has stated on numerous occasions and in many ways that his intent as an artist is to create a body of work that reflects the highlights of popular culture back to his audience, reminding them of who they are, where they come from, and what moves them as human beings. He once wrote "...all of my art is a labor of love for all of you who have enjoyed my work for so long. When we're all gone and many years have passed, I hope that our descendants will look at one of my paintings and say 'that's a Fazzino. He was that artist who painted those zany pictures of what life was really like back then'" 
Artistic Technique.
Charles Fazzino is most well-known for the three-dimensionality of his limited edition silkscreen serigraphs.
In 1980, while exhibiting in the juried arts fairs in Florida, Charles Fazzino attended a 3-D paper tole class in an arts supply store. He experimented with the technique and showed his first three-dimensional print at the Greenwich Village Art Show in New York City in May, 1980.
Fazzino entered the gallery circuit when he sold his first 3-D offset lithographs to a gallery in Michigan. He began using the silkscreen printing process in 1986.
The 3-D Process.
1. Charles Fazzino sends his original line art to the silkscreen printer who then traces the line art onto a piece of mylar to create the black line screen. The printer pushes black ink through the screen to print the outline of the image onto paper.
2. The printer returns the outline to Charles Fazzino for adjustment and color indication.
3. Chromists interpret Charles Fazzino's original color scheme onto a series of screens and the color mixer matches the colors to Fazzino's original painting.
4. Each screen is placed on the printing press during which time the appropriate color ink is pushed through to the paper. The final image appears as each color is laid down on the paper. The order in which the colors are laid down determines the blends and effects that result in the final print.
5. The original image is printed both on 100% rag 2-ply or 4-ply museum board and on 100% rag 1-ply sheets. The elements of the image are cut out of the 1-ply sheets by hand using an exacto knife. The cutouts are carefully layered on top of the boards using a silicone material and resulting in a multi-layered image. The final stage involves the embellishment of each image with acrylic paint glitter and sometimes crystals.

Monk Dubiel

Walter John "Monk" Dubiel (February 12, 1918 – October 23, 1969) was an American professional baseball player, a right-handed pitcher in the Major Leagues for the New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs. The native and lifelong resident of Hartford, Connecticut, stood tall and weighed .
Dubiel pitched for 14 seasons (1941–1954) in professional ball and spent five full seasons and part of two others in the Majors between 1944 and 1952. His best season was his rookie campaign for Yankees. He spilt 26 decisions, but logged 19 complete games, three shutouts and 232 innings pitched, with an earned run average of 3.38. Sent to the minors for the first two seasons immediately after the end of World War II, he resurfaced in the National League in as a "swing man" — working as a starting pitcher and a reliever — for the Phillies. After the 1948 campaign, Dubiel was traded to the Cubs in a four-player swap that brought first baseman Eddie Waitkus to the Phils. Although Waitkus would miss much of the season after being shot by an obsessed fan, he would play a key role on the 1950 "Whiz Kids".
Dubiel pitched in 187 MLB games, 97 as a starter, and allowed 854 hits and 349 bases on balls in 879⅓ innings pitched. He struck out 289 and recorded 11 career saves.

Top-hat transform

In mathematical morphology and digital image processing, top-hat transform is an operation that extracts small elements and details from given images. There exist two types of top-hat transform: The "white top-hat transform" is defined as the difference between the input image and its opening by some structuring element; The "black top-hat transform" is defined dually as the difference between the closing and the input image. Top-hat transforms are used for various image processing tasks, such as feature extraction, background equalization, image enhancement, and others.
Mathematical definitions.
Let formula_1 be a grayscale image, mapping points from an Euclidean space or discrete grid "E" (such as "R"2 or "Z"2) into the real line. Let formula_2 be a grayscale structuring element. 
Then, the white top-hat transform of "f" is given by:
where formula_4 denotes the opening operation.
The black top-hat transform of "f" (sometimes called the "bottom-hat" transform
) is given by:
where formula_6 is the closing operation.
Properties.
The white top-hat transform returns an image, containing those "objects" or "elements" of an input image that:
The black top-hat returns an image, containing the "objects" or "elements" that:
The size, or width, of the elements that are extracted by the top-hat transforms can be controlled by the choice of the structuring element formula_7. The bigger the latter, the larger the elements extracted.
Both top-hat transforms are images that contain only non-negative values at all pixels.

They Came for Good: A History of the Jew in the US is a 1997 documentary by Oscar nominated director Amram Nowak that explores the challenges and contributions of Jews during America's founding history. The film brings to life a series of personalities, including Asher Levy, Louis Moses Gomez, Rebecca Gratz, Uriah Phillips Levy, Levi Strauss, Isaac Leeser, Isaac Mayer Wise, Judah Benjamin, the Warburgs, the Schiffs, and Emma Lazarus.
Summary.
"They Came for Good" is a two part documentary series of critical acclaim.
Part I focuses on the contributions of Sephardic Jews in early America and their hard-fought struggle for equality that eventually brought them presidential respect. Unlike any national leader before his time President George Washington, made history by embracing the Jewish community upon his election and asserting their equality. The pioneering Jews of early America came to the New World to practice their religion openly, and once they arrived they began to shape the budding nation.
Part II examines the people and personalities who shaped the critical time of the mid-18th century, from the creators of the Orthodox and Reform movements to the Ashkenazi entrepreneurs who crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Midwestern prairie to create new American identities.
In 1820, most took a subdued approach to demonstrating their Jewishness. They were a shadow of a population, numbering less than 3,000 nationwide — a minority in a nation of minorities. In the years that followed, however, a massive influx of immigrant Ashkenazi Jewry from Europe arrived to cause a spiritual and economic sea change. The film covers American Jew's entrepreneurial spirit from the mostly-Jewish peddlers selling goods on the back roads of the South to those who run the general stores that will one day grow into nationwide chains like Macy’s, Sears, Gimbels, Sterns and Filene's, Jews were major purveyors of commercial good in this country and, thus, major contributors to popular culture.
Filmmaker.
Director Amram Nowak was nominated for an Oscar for his film Isaac in America. He has also worked as a writer and producer.

Northern Pacific Railway locomotives

Steam Locomotive Classes.
Below is a table of information for the Northern Pacific Railway’s steam roster with a symbol, Whyte notation, common name and notes. (The notes were compiled by Richard Boyland and Wes Barris and first posted May 30, 1991, to the electronic newsgroup "rec.railroad".) Included is a breakdown of the Northern Pacific classes, along with the date of their first construction (when known), builder, and road numbers.
2-10-0.
On the NP the Decapods were used at either end of a very short train over the temporary switchback line across Stampede Pass while Stampede Tunnel was being constructed between 1887 and 1888. They featured blind drivers (no flanges on the wheels) for operation on sharp curves. They were later relegated to use as yard switchers.
Mallet and Simple Articulated Locomotives.
Both of the Northern Pacific's 2-6-6-2 classes were copies of GN designs, including their Belpaire fireboxes, a rarity on NP steam locomotives. NP 3015, last of the Class Z's, had a troubled existence, suffering a crown sheet failure at Kennedy, Washington, on Stampede Pass circa 1916, then later derailing on the Wallace Branch in Idaho in 1933. In both instances the engine crew members were killed or injured.
The Z-2 2-8-8-2s wound up in helper service on Bozeman Pass. The Z-3s, purchased in successive batches, became the main line road and helper power on the route across Stampede Pass until the arrival of EMD's FTs in April, 1944. They were also used as helpers on the steep ascent of the NP's Prairie Line out of Tacoma, Washington, as well as in hauling wartime munitions trains over Stimson Hill between Elma, Washington and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, circa 1944–1945.
The Z-5 "Yellostone"s were two locomotives under one boiler, these were the largest locomotives in the world when delivered in 1928. They eliminated the use of two locomotives on the head-end of freight trains on the Yellowstone Division in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. The 2-8-8-4 was first built for the Northern Pacific Railway in 1928.
The 4-6-6-4 locomotives were so large that in many places in Montana the Northern Pacific had to widen the centers of its double track on the Rocky Mountain Division. As a rule they did not work west of Easton, Washington, due to the confines of Stampede Tunnel under the summit of Stampede Pass. Despite the inaccuracy, these classes were generally referred to by NP engine crews as "Mallets".
Diesel Locomotives.
American Locomotive Company.
Northern Pacific Railway’s Alcos were mostly confine to the east end of the road, on the Lake Superior and St. Paul Divisions.

Next Left Notes

Next Left Notes (NLN) is an independent radical publication and weblog connected to the 2006 re-incarnation of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). "NLN" began producing print versions in March 2008 - to mark its 4th anniversary.
Founding and new SDS.
"Next Left Notes" was founded in March, 2004, by Thomas Good, its current editor.
Good and other "NLN" contributors were one source of the refoundation statement of SDS in January 2006.
"Next Left Notes" differs from "New Left Notes", the publication of SDS in the 1960s from which it takes its name, in that it is not officially connected with SDS - although Good and other members of the "NLN" "collective" are members of Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), the non-student entity that emerged from SDS at the National Convention in Chicago, IL in 2006.
Contributors have included 1960s SDS veterans
(Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Paul Buhle, Mark Rudd) and
young people who are involved in the new SDS (Allison Van Doren, Brendan Dunn, Brian Kelly, Pat Korte) and members of pacifist (Frida Berrigan, David McReynolds) and labor activist groups (Penny Rosemont of Charles H. Kerr, various members of the Industrial Workers of the World).
Publication and ideology.
According to "Next Left Notes", their role in the movement is to cover the New Left actions, conferences and other aspects of the struggle. They provide news articles on left wing events in the United States, as well as commentary and photographic galleries.
Like the 1960s magazine "New Left Notes", the publication's contributors and readers are largely New Left and anti-authoritarian. The articles written for "NLN" support participatory democracy and direct action. The original "New Left Notes" motto, "Let the People Decide", appears on the "NLN" masthead.
Criticism.
Some writers outside the new SDS have criticized Good and "NLN" as "militant", "sectarian" and too close to former members of the Weather Underground.Christopher Phelps. The New SDS, The Nation, 2 April 2007.</ref>
Format.
"NLN" has published as both a web based news site and, since March 2008, as a print publication. Its content, along with an increasing amount of video and photographic work, is largely released under the GNU General Public License.

Scream (Chris Cornell album)

Scream is the third solo studio album by American musician Chris Cornell. Released on March 10, 2009 through Suretone Records and Mosley Music Group, it marked a shift from Cornell's previous musical efforts with the exclusion of some guitar and rock elements that were replaced with producer Timbaland's electronic pop soundscapes. The album was promoted with the release of five digital singles and three music videos, and was met with mostly negative reviews. The album debuted in the U.S at number 10 on the "Billboard" 200 with 26,000 copies sold.
Production.
Recording history.
With the idea of remixing songs from his previous album "Carry On" (2007), Cornell first came into contact with Timbaland. However, the collaboration evolved into the duo writing and recording an entire album in just six weeks, notably with the conceptual direction of "tying it all together musically", which Cornell describes as " back to albums that I listened to when I was a kid, where the music never stops" and that it "begs to be listened to on headphones all the way through".
Musical style.
Billboard reported that "Scream" shows Cornell moving "in a much more R&B-oriented direction, with busy drum machine beats, buffed-up chorus vocals and string samples filling the nooks and crannies", comparing it to Gnarls Barkley and less that of "the guitar-driven music of Cornell's past with Soundgarden and Audioslave". Despite the controversy caused by teaming up with Timbaland, Cornell insisted that he still played an integral part of the album's creation and didn't do what "Timbaland told me to do", further noting that they "didn't really have that relationship" and "it wasn't that type of a process. It was more, he would bring in a beat, an idea, I would write to it and sing it, and we would move on kind of to the next thing."
Describing the album as a whole, Cornell compared it to Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" and Queen's "A Night at the Opera", citing the psychedelic elements that Timbaland brought into the production.
However, while a majority of the album is an R&B styled album, the hidden track "Two Drink Minimum" sees Cornell playing a blues-influenced rock song, with an acoustic guitar, organ, drums, and harmonica.
Reception.
In the U.S, the album debuted at number 10 on the "Billboard" 200 and thus became Cornell's first top 10 solo album. The next week it dropped 55 places to number 65, which was the largest second-week drop for a top 10-debuting album in two and a half years. It was also a commercial disappointment, spending only 10 weeks on the "Billboard" 200.
Initial critical response towards the release was mixed to negative. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 42, based on 19 reviews. "Scream" received positive reviews from "Entertainment Weekly" and "Hot Press" who felt that the collaboration between producer Timbaland and Chris Cornell worked. The mixed reviews were more prevalent, with "Spin" stating the album was "strangely appealing in its elaborately empty efficiency." while "Billboard" noted that "Sometimes it's good bizarre. Other times it's bad bizarre." "Rolling Stone" wrote that "Scream" "veers between drab–sleek and rock–dude soulful; Cornell's yowl never sounds at home". Among the negative reviews, Allmusic wrote that ""Scream" is one of those rare big-budget disasters, an exercise in misguided ambition that makes no sense outside of pure theory."
Nine Inch Nails creator Trent Reznor attacked the album, condemning it as "embarrassing" on Twitter.
Track listing.
All songs written by Chris Cornell, Timothy Mosley and Jerome Harmon, additional writing credits below.
Rock Versions.
There are currently two "Scream" tracks that have had "Rock Versions" of them released. The first being an alternate version of "Long Gone", produced by Howard Benson, which was accompanied by an official music video directed by DJ Skee's Skee.tv.
The second track to come to light was a "Rock Version" of "Never Far Away". This version was not a remix, but a completely new recording, produced by Jordon Zadorozny. It has yet to be released for purchase, but has been, with permission from Cornell himself, made available for streaming by Alan Cross. In October 2009, it was reported that Cornell was working with Jordan Zadorozny and Michael Friedman to rework the entire "Scream" album but this remains unconfirmed. This now seems unlikely as Cornell has now rejoined Soundgarden.

The Impatient Patient

The Impatient Patient is a Warner Bros. "Looney Tunes" cartoon released in theatres in 1942, directed by Norman McCabe and features Daffy Duck as a telegram deliverer. The film is set in a mad scientist's laboratory.
This cartoon was colorized in 1968 (just after Seven Arts Productions, successor to Guild Films, to whom the black-and-white cartoon library had been sold some time before, acquired Warner Bros.) by having every other frame traced over onto a cel. Each redrawn cel was painted in color and then photographed over a colored reproduction of each original background. The animation quality dropped considerably from the original version with this method. The cartoon was colorized again in 1992, this time with a computer adding color to a new print of the original black and white cartoon. This preserved the quality of the original animation (the end result also resembled the actual color cartoons released around the same time).
Plot summary.
While traipsing through the Ookaboochie Swamps, Daffy Duck seeks to deliver a telegram to "Chloe." He finds the home of "Dr. Jerkyl" and hopes that the physician can cure his hiccups. Daffy's hiccups are so severe that they cause him to damage or destroy everything around him.
Dr. Jerkyl captures Daffy and restrains him to a doctor's chair. Hoping to scare Daffy in order to cure his hiccups, Dr. Jerkyl drinks a potion that turns him into an ogre. Terrified, Daffy asks him who he is, and he responds: "I'm Chloe." Daffy then reads him the telegram, which is a cheerful Happy Birthday message from apparently Frankenstein.
Chloe chases Daffy around the laboratory until the radio is accidentally switched on, prompting him to dance. Once the music ends, the chase resumes. Daffy scrambles to the lab table and mixes a potion, which turns Chloe into an infant. Off camera, Daffy hits the infant with a hammer, but only from self-defense and perhaps to teach him a lesson since the infant Chloe intended to hit him with a hammer ("He don't know "me" very well, do he?").

Highlands and Islands Medical Service

The Highlands and Islands Medical Service (HIMS) provided state funded healthcare to a population covering half of Scotland's landmass from its launch in 1913 until the creation of Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. Though treatment was not free, unlike NHS Scotland which succeeded it, fees were set at minimal levels and people could still get treated even if they were unable to pay.
Foundation.
The service came into being as a direct result of the publication of the Report of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service Committee or "Dewar Report" in 1912. This report exposed inadequate medical and nursing services across large parts of the crofting counties and recommended a new way of delivering state funded medical services. Doctors would be guaranteed a minimum salary and cost of travel would be reimbursed. In return they would be expected to visit all those requesting help, be involved in public health and school work, attend midwifery cases and provide themselves with adequate transport. The service also planned an expansion of nursing services with associated nursing accommodation, provide state support to the hospitals and specialists and purchase ambulances. The service was administered by a Board of between 5 & 9 with the first Chair being Sir John Dewar. After an initial survey they predicted an increase in doctors from 170 to 185 and an additional 100 new houses. They requested and were granted an annual treasury grant of £42,000.
Early years.
The service had an uncertain start. An early achievement was the posting of a nurse to St Kilda but the First World War held back developments and was used merly to support the doctors salaries and provide travel expenses. In 1919 administration moved to the Scottish Board of Health and in due course it was seen to be having the desired effect of providing adequate medical services to the population and supporting doctors to live and work in the area. Eventually other aspects of the service were developed including support for specialist surgeons and physicians, a laboratory in Inverness and even the first air ambulance service to the outer isles in 1936.
The Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky, United States, was built on the HIMS model.

Olav Ulleren

Olav Ulleren (born 7 October 1954) is a Norwegian organizational leader, civil servant and former politician for the Centre Party. A veterinary by education, he was a mayor and State Secretary during his political career, and has since made his mark as general director of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities. He is a veterinarian by education. He is currently CEO of The Norwegian Heart and Lung Patient Organization's clinics
Career.
Early career.
Ulleren was born in Tinn, and finished his secondary education in 1973. He took the cand.med.vet. degree at the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science in 1978, was a research assistant in 1979 and acting municipal veterinary in Tinn in 1980. He then held two substitute jobs before doing his compulsory military service. From 1983 to 1991 he worked as the municipal veterinary in Tinn. He later took a master's degree in Knowledge Management from the Norwegian School of Management.
Political career.
Ulleren was a member of Tinn municipal council from 1983 to 1987, was not re-elected in 1987 but then returned in 1991. In 1991 he was elected deputy mayor, and in 1994 he became mayor of Tinn municipality. Representing the Centre Party, he became the first non-Labour mayor of Tinn since 1945. With Ulleren at the helm, the Centre Party almost reached 45% in polls. Ulleren was re-elected in 1995 for a second four-year term, but on 10 May 1999, some months before the 1999 election, he was appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development as a part of the first cabinet Bondevik. Subsequently, the Centre Party in Tinn plummeted with 27.3 percentage points. Ulleren lost his State Secretary position when the first cabinet Bondevik lost a vote of no confidence on 17 March 2000.
During his time in politics, Ulleren was a member of the central committee of the Centre Party for ten years, and also chaired the county chapter in Telemark for six years. He ran as a candidate for the position as vice party leader on multiple occasions, but was never chosen.
Among his non-political assignments during this period was the contribution to the Norwegian Official Report 1998: 11. He was also chairman of the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Tinn Sparebank and a board member of Telemark University College during the 1990s.
Leaving politics.
When his tenure as State Secretary ended, Ulleren did not return to local politics. Instead, he was hired as director in Bioparken. He also served as chair of Akvaforsk, and later as a member of the board of the Southern Norway Regional Health Authority and of Blefjell Hospital Trust. He was also a member of the Norwegian Council for Quality Improvement and Priority Setting in Health Care. Ulleren stopped paying the membership fee for the Centre Party in 2001, and in 2006 he described himself as "without a political attachment".
In 2002 Ulleren was hired as general director of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS). In addition to the usual task of negotiating wages with the trade unions of employees in the municipal sector, Ulleren marked himself as more politically involved than several of his predecessors. Notably, in 2006 Ulleren proposed that a Norwegian municipal reform be considered. In light of the recent reform in Denmark, it has been suggested that the number of municipalities of Norway be reduced, through mergers, from the current tally at around 430. Ulleren stated while a direct import of the Danish model was undesirable, something should be done in the way of merging some municipalities. Ulleren has also supported a regional reform. In 2003 he predicted the future abolishment of the county municipality and the county council, though at the end of his term in 2009, both still existed.
Civil servant.
In late 2008, it was announced that Ulleren would become the new permanent under-secretary of State in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food in 2009, succeeding Per Harald Grue who was due to retire. The permanent under-secretary of State is the highest-ranking position in a Ministry, except for the partisan positions of Minister and State Secretary. Among the tasks in the Ministry of Agriculture is to represent the state party in the annual general price settlement on agricultural produce.
The decision to appoint Ulleren was criticized by Hans Frode Asmyhr of the Progress Party for being a perceived consolidation of the Centre Party. First, the Minister who was responsible for the appointment, Lars Peder Brekk, represents the Centre Party. Second, Asmyhr insinuated that the other parties in the agricultural settlement also represented the Centre Party. While both leaders of the main farmers' interest organizations, Pål Haugstad of the Norwegian Agrarian Association and Ole-Anton Teigen of the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union, did support the appointment, Teigen is an active politician for the Socialist Left Party. Lars Peder Brekk deemed Asmyhr's allegations to be "clear-cut piffle", citing that Ulleren had the necessary qualifications for the position. In addition, other politicians from opposition parties, including Leif Helge Kongshaug (Liberal) and Torbjørn Hansen (Conservative), defended the appointment of Ulleren.
Personal life.
After leaving Tinn in 1999, Ulleren has lived in Bærum and Oslo. He still owns 20,000 decares of land in Tinn, which includes fields, forest and freshwater. Although he owns two dozen sheep, and sells licenses for fishing and "Lagopus" hunting on his estate, he uses the land mainly for recreation. Ulleren's hobbies include telemark skiing.

Equitation science

Equitation science is defined as "the application of scientific methods to assess objectively the welfare of horses undergoing training." It promotes an evidence-based understanding of horse-rider interactions. The goal is to apply valid, quantitative scientific methods to identify what training techniques are ineffective or painful, and to improve the horse-rider relationship by explaining horse training from a learning theory perspective that removes anthropomorphism and emotiveness. It can aid the training process by clarifying the roles of positive versus negative reinforcement, punishment, and by identifying stimuli that provoke unwanted responses or pain in horses. Equitation science uses psychological principles such as learning theory as well as equine ethology and biomechanics. It uses objective measures to score performance during training and competitions and identifies techniques that may result in equine suffering.
Recent technological advances have now made it possible to measure the strength of a rider’s signals. Thus, riding concepts such as ‘contact’ and ‘lightness’ can now be evaluated with calibrated rein tension gauges, or via spurs and riding boots made from pressure-sensitive material. Radiographic studies can give insights into the horse’s mouth – the position of different bit types and positional changes in response to rein tension. Measuring pressures beneath the saddle on the horse’s back is valuable for assessing saddle fit and to circumvent back problems caused by ill-fitting saddles. Equitation science uses physiological measurements such as heart rate, blood, urine and saliva analyses to evaluate the comfort and stress level of the horse. It also evaluates behavioural indicators of ineffective horse-rider communication and conflict such as teeth grinding, tail swishing, rearing or bucking.
Using a multidisciplinary scientific approach that involves veterinarians, animal and behavioural scientists, psychologists, engineers, and professional riders and trainers, equitation science encourages the use of appropriate training techniques that result in fewer injuries and behavioural problems, enhance the horses’ lifespan and the safety of both horse and rider.
International Society for Equitation Science (ISES).
The International Society for Equitation Science (ISES) unites academics and practitioners. Its mission is to promote and encourage the application of objective research and advanced practice which will ultimately improve the welfare of horses in their associations with humans. During discussions following the Havemeyer Foundation Workshop on Horse Behavior and Welfare in Iceland in 2002, the idea of establishing a society devoted to equitation science was first raised. In 2007, the ISES was founded by individuals with expertise in various equine fields of knowledge from around the world.

Colorado State Highway 21

State Highway 21 is an expressway in El Paso County, in eastern Colorado Springs. The highway serves as an eastern bypass for the city of Colorado Springs. Officially, the routing is from I-25 at Northgate Blvd in the north to Drennan Rd in the south.
Route description.
For most of its routing the highway is a four to six-lane, limited access highway. In the north, it begins as a semi-freeway with a 60 mph speed limit, and becomes a six lane expressway with a 55 mph speed limit in the city of Colorado Springs after Union Boulevard and remains so throughout the entire route. The northern section, from Research Parkway to Interquest Parkway/SH 83 is constructed to interstate highway standards with sufficient right-of-way to construct planned overpasses and on/off-ramps. CDOT completed interchanges and bridges at Union Boulevard and Briargate Parkway in 2013. Future interchanges at Research Parkway, Old Ranch Road, SH 83 and a future freeway to freeway interchange planned for the SH 21/I-25/Northgate Blvd interchange will be constructed based on the availability of funding and need. The whole routing from I-25 to Proby Parkway is planned as a controlled-access freeway. The southern portion (from Research Parkway) is a limited-access highway with interchanges constructed at Woodmen Road and Platte Ave/US 24. It ends at Mesa Ridge Parkway in Security-Widefield.
History.
The route was established on October 1, 2007. When defined, its routing included the entire length of Powers Boulevard.
Junction list.
The entire route is in El Paso County.

Argentine Revolution

Revolución Argentina ("Argentine Revolution") was the name given by its leaders to a military coup which overthrew the government of Argentina in June 1966, and to a period of military dictatorship by a military junta from then until 1973.
The "Revolución Argentina" and the "authoritarian-bureaucratic state".
The June 1966 coup established General Juan Carlos Onganía as de facto president, supported by several leaders of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), including the general secretary Augusto Vandor. This was followed by a series of military-appointed presidents and the implementation of neo-liberal economic policies, supported by multinational companies, employers' federations, part of the more-or-less corrupt workers' movement, and the press.
While preceding military coups were aimed at establishing temporary, transitional "juntas", the "Revolución Argentina" headed by Onganía aimed at establishing a new political and social order, opposed both to liberal democracy and to Communism, which would give the Armed Forces of Argentina a leading political and economic role. Political scientist Guillermo O'Donnell named this type of regime "authoritarian-bureaucratic state", in reference to the "Revolución Argentina", the 1964–1985 Brazilian military regime, Augusto Pinochet's regime (starting in 1973) and Juan María Bordaberry's regime in Uruguay.
Onganía's rule (1966–70).
Onganía implemented corporatist policies, experimenting in particular in Cordoba under the governance of Carlos Caballero. The new Minister of Economy, Adalbert Krieger Vasena, decreed a wage freeze and a 40% devaluation, which strongly affected the state of the Argentinian economy - in particular the agricultural sector - and favored foreign capital. Vasena suspended collective labour conventions, reformed the "hydrocarbons law" which had established a partial monopoly of the "Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales" (YPF) state firm, and passed a law facilitating the eviction of tenants over their non-payment of domestic rent. Finally, the right to strike was suspended (Law 16,936) and several other laws passed reversing previous progressive labor legislation (reducing retirement age, etc.).
The workers' movement divided itself between Vandoristas, who supported a "Peronism without Perón" line (Augusto Vandor, leader of the General Confederation of Labour, declared that "to save Perón, one has to be against Perón") and advocated negotiation with the junta, alongside "Participationists" headed by José Alonso, and Peronists, who formed the "CGT de los Argentinos" (or "CGTA") in 1968 and were opposed to any kind of participation with the military junta. Perón himself, from his exile in Franquist Spain, maintained a cautious and ambiguous line of opposition to the regime, rejecting both endorsement and open confrontation.
Cultural and education policies.
Onganía's rule signified an end to university autonomy, which had been achieved by the University Reform of 1918. 
He was responsible for the July 1966 "La Noche de los Bastones Largos" ("The Night of the Long Truncheons"), where university autonomy was violated, in which he ordered police to invade the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires. They beat up and arrested students and professors. The university repression led to the exile of 301 university professors, among whom were Manuel Sadosky, Tulio Halperín Donghi, Sergio Bagú and Risieri Frondizi.
Onganía also ordered repression on all forms of "immoralism", proscribing miniskirts, long hair for young men, and all avant-garde artistic movements. This moral campaign alienated the middle classes, who were massively present in universities.
Change of direction of the Armed Forces.
Towards the end of May 1968, General Julio Alsogaray dissented from Onganía, and rumors spread about a possible coup d'état, with Algosaray leading the opposition to Onganía. At the end of the month Onganía dismissed the leaders of the Armed Forces: Alejandro Lanusse replaced Julio Alsogaray, Pedro Gnavi replaced Benigno Varela, and Jorge Martínez Zuviría replaced Adolfo Alvarez.
Increasing protests.
On 19 September 1968, two important events affected Revolutionary Peronism. John William Cooke, former personal delegate of Perón, an ideologist of the Peronist Left and friend of Fidel Castro, died from natural causes. On the same day a group of 13 men and one woman who aimed at establishing a "foco" in Tucuman Province, in order to head the resistance against the junta, was captured; among them was Envar El Kadre, then a leader of the Peronist Youth.
In 1969, the "CGT de los Argentinos" (led by Raimundo Ongaro) headed protest movements, in particular the Cordobazo, as well as other movements in Tucuman, Santa Fe and Rosario ("Rosariazo"). While Perón managed a reconciliation with Augusto Vandor, he followed, in particular through the voice of his delegate Jorge Paladino, a cautious line of opposition to the military junta, criticizing with moderation the neoliberal policies of the junta but waiting for discontent inside the government (""hay que desensillar hasta que aclare"", said Perón, advocating patience). Thus, Onganía had an interview with 46 CGT delegates, among them Vandor, who agreed on "participationism" with the military junta, thus uniting themselves with the "Nueva Corriente de Opinión" headed by José Alonso and Rogelio Coria.
In December 1969, more than 20 priests, members of the "Movimiento de Sacerdotes para el Tercer Mundo" (MSTM, Movement of Priests for the Third World), marched on the Casa Rosada to present to Onganía a petition pleading him to abandon the eradication plan of "villas miserias" (shanty towns).
The same year, the Movement of Priests for the Third World issued a declaration supporting Socialist revolutionary movements, which lead the Catholic hierarchy, by the voice of Juan Carlos Aramburu, coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires, to proscribe priests from making political or social declarations.
Various armed actions, headed by the "Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación" (FAL), composed by former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, occurred in April 1969, leading to several arrests among FAL members. These were the first left-wing urban guerrilla actions in Argentina. Beside these isolated actions, the Cordobazo uprising of 1969, called forth by the CGT de los Argentinos, and its Cordobese leader, Agustín Tosco, prompted demonstrations in the entire country. The same year, the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) was formed as the military branch of the Trotskyist Workers' Revolutionary Party, leading an armed struggle against the dictatorship.
Levingston's rule (1970–71).
Faced with increasing opposition, in particular following the "Cordobazo", General Onganía was forced to resign by the military junta, composed of the chiefs of the Army, the Navy and the Air Forces. He was replaced by General Roberto Marcelo Levingston, who, far from calling free elections, decided to deepen the "Revolución Argentina". Levingston expressed the nationalist-developmentist sector of the Armed Forces, and was supported by the most intransigent military elements. He named the radical economist Aldo Ferrer as Minister of Economy.
A coalition of political parties issued the statement known as "La Hora del Pueblo", calling for free and democratic elections which would include the Justicialist Party. Under this pressure, Levingston was ousted by an internal coup headed by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and strongman of the "Revolución Argentina", General Alejandro Agustín Lanusse.
Lanusse's rule (1971–73).
The last of the military presidents "de facto" of this period, Alejandro Lanusse, was appointed in March 1971. He was as unpopular as his predecessors. His administration started building infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, etc.) necessary for the development of the country, without responding to popular demands concerning social and economic policies.
General Lanusse tried to respond to the "Hora del Pueblo" declaration by calling elections but excluding Peronists from them, in the so-called "Gran Acuerdo Nacional" (Great National Agreement). He nominated Arturo Mor Roig (Radical Civic Union) as Minister of Interior, who enjoyed the support of the "Hora del pueblo" coalition of parties, to supervise the coming elections.
There had been no elections since 1966, and armed struggle groups came into existence, such as the "Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo" (ERP, the armed wing of the Workers' Revolutionary Party, PRT), the Catholic nationalist Peronists Montoneros, or the "Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias" (FAR). 
In August 1972, an attempt by several revolutionary members to escape from prison, headed by Mario Roberto Santucho (PRT), was followed by what became known as the massacre of Trelew. Fernando Vaca Narvaja, Roberto Quieto, Enrique Gorriarán Merlo and Domingo Menna managed to complete their escape, but 19 others were re-captured. 16 of them, members of the Montoneros, the FAR, and the ERP, were killed, and 3 managed to survive. On the same night of August 22, 1972, the junta approved law 19,797, which proscribed any information concerning guerrilla organizations. The massacre led to demonstrations in various cities.
Finally, Lanusse lifted the proscription of the Justicialist Party, although he maintained it concerning Juan Perón by increasing the number of years of residency required of presidential candidates, thus excluding "de facto" Perón from the elections since he had been in exile since the 1955 "Revolución Libertadora". 
Henceforth, Perón decided to appoint as his candidate his personal secretary Héctor José Cámpora, a leftist Peronist, as representative of the FreJuLi ("Frente Justicialista de Liberación", Justicialist Liberation Front), composed of the Justicialist Party and minor, allied parties. The FreJuLi's electoral slogan was "Cámpora in Government, Perón in power" ("Cámpora al Gobierno, Perón al poder").

Gardner color scale

Gardner Color Scale is a one-dimensional scale to measure the shade of the color yellow.
History.
Colors of transparent liquids have been studied visually since the early 19th century. Changes in color can indicate contamination or impurities in the raw materials, process variations, or degradation of products over time.
One dimensional scales for yellowness were created, e.g., Gardner Color Scale. The yellowness of the transparent liquid is determined by pouring the sample into a tube and comparing it to a pre determined and known standard. The standard that the sample falls closest to then becomes the value for the liquid. This procedure isn't extremely accurate due to variations of observers, illumination and to some extent the standards themselves.

Okinawa Prefectural Museum

The is a museum in the most southern prefecture of Japan. The museum complex in the Omoro-machi area of Naha, the capital city of Okinawa Prefecture. It opened in November 2007, and includes art, history, and natural history museums focusing specifically on Okinawan topics.
The museum building, constructed largely of local Okinawan limestone, was designed with the imagery of Okinawa's "gusuku" (castles) in mind. It contains roughly 24,000 square meters of floor space on its four above-ground levels and one basement level. The art museum and history/natural history museum are located on opposite sides of a common lobby, and visitors can buy admission to one or the other, or a combination ticket.
History.
The Okinawa Prefectural Museum was originally established in May 1972, as a matter of course following the end of the US Occupation of Okinawa and its return to Japan, being primarily a renaming and reorganization of the Ryukyu Governmental Museum (琉球政府立博物館) established in 1946. It was based in the Ōnaka-chō neighborhood of Shuri, near Shuri Castle, and was closed in 2007, moving to the new site. The museum in its former incarnation focused upon Okinawan history, natural history, folk life, and related topics. The art museum included on the new site is the first prefectural art museum in Okinawa.
Sections.
The gardens in front of the museum include reproductions of two traditional-style Okinawan buildings - a thatch-roofed storehouse, and a traditional-style tile-roofed home - along with a number of "shisa" statues and other items representing Okinawa's tradition of pottery and ceramics. A sculpture garden located behind the museum features large contemporary artworks, and opens onto a large public park, Shintoshin Park.
The Natural History section of the museum is entered via a glass-floored walkway designed to look as though one is walking over coral, approaching an island. A large wrap-around screen shows short films about the geological origins of the Ryukyu Islands and about its natural environment, flora, and fauna. Several rooms cover a variety of aspects of the islands' natural environment, including numerous specimens of the islands' flora and fauna, a discussion of the dangers facing coral reefs and endangered species, and Minatogawa man, the oldest "Homo sapiens" specimen found in East Asia.
The History section is organized around a large map of the Ryukyu archipelago projected onto the floor and connected into a number of computer terminals allowing visitors to explore aspects of individual islands, including satellite photographs of famous sites, native flora and fauna, and local culture. The several rooms of the history section of the museum cover the entire history of the Ryukyus, from early Jōmon period culture through the return to Japanese sovereignty following the US Occupation. Numerous artifacts, art objects, and reproductions thereof are employed to illustrate the historical topics.
The Art Museum includes spaces for special temporary exhibits along with galleries displaying objects from the museum's collection. The exhibitions focus on early modern and contemporary artworks by Okinawan artists, those relating to or associated with Okinawa in some way, and a number of other works by Japanese, other Asian, and American artists. The permanent exhibits are rotated three to four times a year.
In addition to the main exhibit halls, cafe, museum shop, and auditorium, the museum includes an extensive library, and a where visitors can explore aspects of Okinawa's natural environment and folk culture in a hands-on manner, including traditional clothing, musical instruments such as the sanshin, and a variety of puzzles and games. The museum also hosts a variety of events, including live performances, lectures, and films.

The second USS "Hazel" (AN-29/YN-24) was an "Aloe"-class net laying ship which was assigned to serve the U.S. Navy during World War II with her protective anti-submarine nets.
Built in Lorain, Ohio.
"Hazel" (YN-24), originally "Poplar" but renamed soon after keel-laying, was launched 15 February 1941 by American Shipbuilding Company, Lorain, Ohio, and was placed in service 27 October 1941. She commissioned 17 December 1942 at Newport, Rhode Island, Lt. (j.g.) A. W. Brown commanding.
World War II service.
After being placed in service, "Hazel" steamed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Boston, Massachusetts, where her outfitting was completed. She performed net laying duties at Portland, Maine, and had returned to Boston by the fateful morning of America's entry into the war, 7 December 1941. 
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the net tender was assigned to Newport, where she performed patrol duties in addition to installing and maintaining the anti-submarine net. "Hazel" commissioned in December 1942, and remained in the Narragansett Bay area, based at the Naval Net Depot, Melville, Rhode Island. She occasionally performed patrol and fire fighting duties in addition to net tending and installation.
"Hazel" was redesignated "AN-29", 20 January 1944 and after spending October-November 1944 at Portland, Maine, returned to Newport to train officers and men in net defenses and do experimental work for the net depot. She arrived Boston, Massachusetts, 21 February 1945 to work on the Boston harbor nets, and in the spring was assigned to the Panama Canal Zone. "Hazel" departed Boston 20 April and arrived Cristobal 2 May 1945.
Tending nets in the Panama Canal Zone defense system until the end of the war, "Hazel" then took on the large task of removing the intricate defenses from the Canal and its approaches. This was completed 14 October 1945 and the ship returned to its base at Coco Solo. She remained in the 15th Naval District performing miscellaneous duties at Coco Solo, Balboa, and other installations until 2 December 1957, when she departed for Florida. 
Post-war decommissioning.
"Hazel" arrived Mayport, Florida, 9 December and decommissioned 11 February 1958. She was placed in reserve at Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she remained until struck from the Navy List 1 September 1962.

Occult theories about Francis Bacon

A number of writers, some of whom were connected with Theosophy, have claimed that Francis Bacon (22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626), the English philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist and author, was a member of secret societies; a smaller number claim that he would have attained the Ascension and became the Ascended Master Saint Germain.
Secret societies.
Francis Bacon often gathered with the men at Gray's Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing. Bacon's alleged connection to the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books. However others, including Daphne du Maurier (in her biography of Bacon), have argued there is no substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians. Historian Dame Frances Yates does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's "The New Atlantis" portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.
In 1618 Francis Bacon decided to secure a lease for York House. This had been his boyhood home in London next to the Queen's York Place before the Bacon family had moved to Gorhambury in the countryside. After Lord Egerton (Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England) died, it became available for Bacon to lease. During the next four years this mansion on the Strand (so large that it had 40 fireplaces) served as the home for Francis and Alice Bacon. Over the next four years Bacon would host banquets at York House that were attended by the leading men of the time, including poets, scholars, authors, scientists, lawyers, diplomats, and foreign dignitaries. Within the banquet hall, Francis gathered the greatest leaders in literature, art, law, education, and social reform. On 22 January 1621 in honour of Sir Francis Bacon's sixtieth birthday, a select group of men assembled in the large banquet hall in York House without fanfare for what has been described as a Masonic banquet. This banquet was to pay tribute to Sir Francis Bacon. Only those of the Rosicrosse (Rosicrucians) and the Masons who were already aware of Bacon's leadership role were invited. The tables were T-tables with gleaming white drapery, silver, and decorations of flowers. The poet Ben Jonson, a long-time friend of Bacon, gave a Masonic ode to Bacon that day. 
There was a depth of love by a large body of men toward Bacon, similar to some degree in the manner that disciples love a Master. This is especially true when taking into account his membership (and some say leadership) of secret societies such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons. In the inner esoteric membership, which included Francis Bacon, vows of celibacy for spiritual reasons were encouraged.
Faked death theory.
Various authors have written that there were indications that Francis Bacon had gone into debt while secretly funding the publishing of materials for the Freemasons, Rosicrucians, "Spear-Shakers", "Knights of the Helmet", as well as publishing, with the assistance of Ben Jonson, a selection of the plays that they believe he had written under the pen name of "Shake-Speare" in a "First Folio" in 1623. Furthermore, they allege that Bacon faked his own death, crossed the English Channel, and secretly traveled in disguise after 1626 through France, Germany, Poland, Hungary, and other areas utilizing the secret network of Freemasons and Rosicrucians that he was associated with. It is alleged that he continued to write under pseudonyms, as he had done before 1626, continuing to write as late as 1670 (using the pseudonym "Comte De Gabalis"). Elinor Von Le Coq, wife of Professor Von Le Coq in Berlin, stated that she had found evidence in the German Archives that Francis Bacon stayed after 1626 with the family of Johannes Valentinus Andreae in Germany.
Basil Montagu, a biographer of Bacon, states in his "Essays and Selections":
Of his funeral no account can be found, nor is there any trace of the scite of the house where he died. 
Beginning early in the 20th century in the United States, a number of Ascended Master Teachings organizations began making the claim that Francis Bacon had never died. They believed that soon after completing the "Shake-Speare" plays, he had feigned his own death on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1626 - doing so in Easter Sunday as a symbolism - and then traveled extensively outside of England, eventually attaining his physical Ascension to another plane on May 1, 1684 in a castle in Transylvania owned by the Rakoczi family. Their belief is that Bacon took on the name "Saint Germain" on that date, May 1, 1684, and became an Ascended Master.

Gruž

Gruž () ("also called St. Croce") is a modern-day neighborhood in the greater city of Dubrovnik, Croatia. The main port for Dubrovnik is in Gruž as well as its largest market and the main bus station "Libertas". Around 15,000 people currently live in Gruž. While historically a manufacturing and industrial base for Dubrovnik, these days, the primarily residential neighborhood is about 2 km northwest of the more famous Old City.
From the 13th century and greatly through the 16th, Gruž was a far more separate town from Dubrovnik that provided a summer retreat for the inhabitants of the Republic of Ragusa. The shores, like those of Ombla, are populated with a great many stone homes and former summer palaces that are surrounded by cultivated grounds.
Starting in December, 1920, Gruž was the terminus point for the now defunct Dubrovnik tram that ceased running in 1970 following a deadly accident where the tram slipped off its rails and landed in the park in front of Pile Gate. The line has since been replaced by bus routes.
Located in a naturally protected bay, the port is able to accommodate large passenger cruise ships. Ferries run from the port to the Elaphiti Islands and Mljet regularly. There is also a customs building for ferries that are international arrivals, specifically from Bari.
Gruž sits right at the entrance to Port Ombla. It is directly across the water from Cantafigo point, which lacks anchorage points due to the shores and the bottom of the inlet being immersed by banks of mud, deposited during heavy rains. Vessels belonging to Dubrovnik spend their winters at Gruž. Violent squalls descend from the highlands bring the cold, northerly bora, but the waters in the bay of Gruž remain calm.

Robert Guérard

Robert Guérard (1641 – 2 January 1715) was a French Benedictine scholar of the Congregation of St. Maur.
Life.
Guérard was born at Rouen. For some time he collaborated at Saint-Denys in the Maurist edition of the works of Augustine of Hippo. In 1675, however, he had to leave Saint-Denys by order of Louis XIV, who wrongly suspected him of having had a hand in the publication of "L'Abbé commendataire", a work which severely criticized the practice of holding and bestowing abbeys, etc., "in commendam. 
His superior sent him to the monastery of Notre Dame at Ambronay, in the Diocese of Belley. While in exile, he discovered at the Carthusian monastery of Portes a manuscript of Augustine's "Opus imperfectum" against Julian of Eclanum, which was afterwards used in the Maurist edition of Augustine's works. 
After a year of exile he was recalled, and spent the rest of his life successively at Fécamp Abbey and at the monastery of Saint-Ouen, where he died.

Bokura no Machi de

"Bokura no Machi de" (僕らの街で in Japanese text, translates to ""In Our Town"") is the third overall single by the Japanese boy band KAT-TUN, and the second from their second studio album, "Cartoon KAT-TUN II You". The first ballad to be released as a single, it is also the first commercially released song to not feature Jin Akanishi who took a sabbatical from the group in October 2006 to study in Los Angeles. The single was released in three editions; a regular edition with instrumental versions of the title track and a b-side, a first press limited edition with a bonus track and its instrumental version and a limited edition with the single's music video.
It was released on December 7, 2006 and became KAT-TUN's third consecutive number 1 on the Oricon singles charts.
Single information.
"Bokura no Machi de" was written entirely by folk singer-songwriter Kazumasa Oda for KAT-TUN. He was an active participant in the recording studio attending each member's recording session from start to finish while providing advice for each of them. The song was featured as the ending theme song to Kazuya Kamenashi and Koki Tanaka's romance drama, "Tatta Hitotsu no Koi", and as such, the lyrics correspond with the troubled relationship Kamenashi's character and his love interest (portrayed by Haruka Ayase) once shared.
Promotion.
KAT-TUN debuted the song on television on "Utawara" on December 3, 2006 and were guests on their "senpai" Masahiro Nakai's talk show "Utaban" on the day the single was released. The group performed on "Music Station" the day after and were invited to perform on "Music Station"'s special end-of-year show, Super Live, on December 22 where they also performed their debut hit single, "Real Face". The group rounded off the year by performing with other Johnny's Entertainment groups on the special end-of-year countdown concert at Tokyo Dome.
On March 18, 2007, co-lead vocalist Kazuya Kamenashi was a guest on "Shounen Club Premium" where he collaborated with Tokio vocalist and keyboardist Tomoya Nagase and Kokubun Taichi for a one-off performance of the single. KAT-TUN also performed with Every Little Thing on their talk show "Cartoon KAT-TUN" on February 27, 2008, singing the title track and ELT's single, "Shapes of Love".
Chart performance.
In its first week of its release, the single knocked off KinKi Kids' "Harmony of December" from the top spot on the Oricon singles chart. It reportedly sold 410,103 copies and was certified as the 13th best-selling song of 2006 with those numbers alone. By the end of its chart run in early 2007, the song had reportedly sold over 558,491 copies and was later certified Double Platinum by RIAJ denoting over 500,000 shipments. 
The single was honored at the 21st Japan Gold Disc Awards when it placed on the "Best 10 Singles (Domestic)" list along with "Real Face" and "Signal".

Care Continuum Alliance

The Care Continuum Alliance (formerly DMAA: The Care Continuum Alliance) is an industry trade group of corporations and individuals that "promotes the role of population health improvement in raising the quality of care, improving health outcomes and reducing preventable health care costs for individuals with chronic conditions and those at risk for developing chronic conditions". It supports "care continuum services" such as "health and wellness promotion, disease management, and care coordination" by means of "advocacy, research and the promotion of best practices in care management".
Current structure.
The Care Continuum Alliance "represents more than 200 corporate and individual stakeholders". Membership categories include:
The Care Continuum Alliance is governed by a Board of Directors and a structure of committees, subcommittees and work groups. The organization maintains a professional staff in Washington, D.C., to perform day-to-day administration. In 2008, the Care Continuum Alliance reported that it paid $80,000 in lobbying expenses to Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal.
History.
The organization was formed in March 1999 as the Disease Management Association of America (DMAA). Its stated purpose was "educating the health care industry, government, employers and the general public about the important role that disease management programs play in improving health care quality and outcomes for people with chronic conditions". The organization's first President was Al Lewis, who described an "irreversible trend toward more disease management" but with some barriers such as state privacy laws.
In early 2003, the Care Continuum Alliance hired Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz to advocate for its interests in the U.S. executive and legislative branches. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act passed later that year was described as a "major victory" for the Care Continuum Alliance and the firm, in that the law "authorizpayment for services provided by its [i.e., the Alliance's members to people with chronic illnesses".
In December 2006, the title of the top position of the Board of Directors changed from "President" to "Chairman," and the chief staff officer's title changed from "Executive Director" to "President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)". Tracey Moorhead, the current President and CEO, has been quoted in the newsmedia concerning not only the Care Continuum Alliance but also chronic conditions in general.
As part of a three-year rebranding to its current name, the organization announced a transitional name change ("DMAA: The Care Continuum Alliance") and new mission in September 2007 to reflect the expansion among its membership to services and products along the entire care continuum—from workplace wellness and prevention to disease management and more complex interventions.
Also in 2007, the Care Continuum Alliance redefined this expanded care focus as "population health improvement" and published its "population health improvement model" to document the change.
Major publications.
Among the Care Continuum Alliance's notable publications are:
"Outcomes Guidelines Report" (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010).
In recent years, Care Continuum Alliance research activities have focused heavily on measuring outcomes in population-based interventions, such as wellness and care management. These activities were conducted at least partly in response to a 2004 Congressional Budget Office analysis that concluded that published studies "do not provide a firm basis for concluding that such programs generally reduce total costs".
In 2006, the group initiated a project to build industry consensus on measuring clinical and financial outcomes in wellness and population health management and published the first volume of its oft-cited "Outcomes Guidelines Report" in December of that year. The usefulness of the first volume was questioned because the guidelines were voluntary in nature and "equivocateon a number of key issues, preventing true standardization even if they were adopted industrywide". In September 2007, the Care Continuum Alliance produced a second volume, with a greater emphasis on clinical outcomes (the first had focused mainly on financial measures). The organization released third and fourth volumes of its guidelines in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Volume 3 continued a "collaboration with NCQA and other contributors to expand and refine measures in all areas—in particular, methods and measures that allow meaningful comparisons across programs". The Care Continuum Alliance released a fifth volume of the guidelines Oct. 14, 2010, at its 2010 annual meeting, in Washington, D.C.
"Population Health Improvement: A Market Survey Report" (2010).
This market analysis collected responses from 135 purchasers and providers of health and wellness services and explored a variety of metrics, such as intervention types, use of incentives and measures of success. The analysis also examines market trends, including purchasing expectations, insourcing versus outsourcing of services and use of integrated data platforms. The survey found that 73 percent of purchasers planned to offer population health improvement programs within the 12 months following the survey's release and that 76 percent planned to do so by the end of 2011. Of those already purchasing programs, 84 percent expected additional purchases.
"Disease Management and Wellness: Results of a Market Research Survey" (2008).
Among other findings, this survey of health plans, employers, and disease management and wellness program providers determined that "84% of health plans and employers offer one or more wellness programs" and that "diabetes, coronary artery disease and asthma represent the top three conditions for disease management program enrollment".
"Participant Satisfaction Survey" (2006).
Developed with support from J. D. Power and Associates, this tool consists of four modules on "access to care, coordination of care, improvements to quality of life and ability to self-manage chronic conditions". A report prepared for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality cites the survey tool as a potential measure for patient self-management support programs.
"Dictionary of Disease Management Terminology" (2004, 2006).
The first (2004) edition of this book defined 126 terms related to disease management. The second edition appeared in 2006.

<doc id="18621039" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18621039" title="Kenneth L. Davis">
Kenneth L. Davis

Kenneth L. Davis is an American author and medical researcher who developed the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, the most widely used tool to test the efficacy of treatments for Alzheimer's Disease designed specifically to evaluate the severity of cognitive and noncognitive behavioral dysfunctions characteristic to persons with Alzheimer's disease.
His paper, "Dopamine in schizophrenia—a review and reconceptualization" (American Journal of Psychiatry, 148 1474-86, November 1991) is the third most-cited paper on schizophrenia research in its decade.
He is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.
Alzheimer's research.
Davis participated in breakthrough proof-of-concept studies and clinical trials of cholinesterase inhibitors. These trials (the first multicenter ones for cholinesterase inhibitors) established efficacy and ultimately led the first four of the five FDA-approved compounds for treating the symptoms of Alzheimer's: tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil and memantine
In 1978, Davis, together with Richard Mohs, conducted the first well-controlled study of a drug that was shown able to improve the storage and retrieval functions of long-term memory in humans.
In 1987, Davis participated in the first study providing strong evidence that Alzheimer’s risk is inherited.
While at Mount Sinai Hospital, Davis and his associates have been at the forefront in the delineation of the role of amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease, and were among the first to report the cloning and chromosomal location of the amyloid precursor protein, regarded as one of the most important discoveries in Alzheimer’s research in the previous 15 years.
Schizophrenia research.
Davis's work on schizophrenia has shown that oligodendroglia cells and myelin play roles in the disease's pathophysiology and that dopamine – long thought to be merely hyperactive in a schizophrenic brain – is actually "hypoactive" in different regions. 
While studies have shown that individuals born in winter months are disproportionately likely to develop schizophrenia, Davis participated in a 2006 study that demonstrated that this disproportionality also exists in tropical regions, ruling out cold weather as the cause.
Biography.
Davis graduated magna cum laude from Yale College and later valedictorian of Mount Sinai School of Medicine's second graduating class where he received the Harold Elster Memorial Award for highest academic achievement. Graduate medical education was completed at Stanford University.
In 1979, Davis was made Chief of Psychiatry at Bronx Veteran's Affairs Medical Center, where he became the first director of its Schizophrenia Biological Research Center. From 1987 until 2003, he was Chairman of Psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
In 2003, Davis was appointed Dean of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and held that position until 2007, when he was succeeded by Dennis S. Charney, M.D. Davis was also appointed as the President and C.E.O. of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in 2003 – positions he holds today. He is the director of the Mount Sinai Silvio Conte Neuroscience Center, Trustee of the New York Academy of Medicine, and Chair of the New York Academy of Medicine Deans Council. In addition, he has served as Chairman of the Board of Governors for the Greater New York Hospital Association.

Robert Pittman (media executive)

Robert Warren "Bob" Pittman (born December 28, 1953), is an American businessman and the founder of MTV. Pittman joined Clear Channel in November 2010 as an investor and the company’s Chairman of Media and Entertainment Platforms, was named CEO of Clear Channel Communications in 2012 and was named Chairman in 2013. Pittman has also been the CEO of MTV Networks, AOL, Six Flags Theme Parks, Quantum Media, Century 21 Real Estate and Time Warner Enterprises, and COO of America Online, Inc. and AOL Time Warner. 
He has also been a radio and TV programmer, marketer, investor and media entrepreneur who has had multiple careers in a number of consumer-focused industries. According to Sean Parker, Pittman is the only media mogul who’s genuinely an entrepreneur. In giving him its first-ever 'Media Visionary" award, advertising publication Adweek referred to him as a "jack of all media" and former MTV executive Tom Freston referred to him as "the wonder boy of branding."
Biography.
Early life.
Son of a Methodist minister, Pittman was born in Jackson, Mississippi, but raised in Brookhaven and became a radio announcer at the age of 15 to earn money for flying lessons. He was an announcer in a number of cities and then successfully programmed radio stations in Pittsburgh, Chicago and finally at the NBC flagship station, WNBC, in New York when he was 23 years old. He also produced and co-hosted a music video and news show in 1978 that ran on NBC's O&O television stations. He did learn to fly, and has been a pilot for almost 40 years: He now has over 6,000 flight hours; currently holds an Airline Transport Pilot's license for airplanes; and is rated for helicopters and 3 types of jets.
MTV Years.
At MTV, he oversaw the creation and growth of MTV and the transition of Nickelodeon from a network geared to preschoolers to one aimed at older kids as well as overseeing the launches of VH-1 and Nick at Nite, and led the initial public offering for MTV Networks and its expansion into international markets. Under Pittman's leadership, MTV became the first profitable cable network; then-Time Warner Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ross also noted that MTV became the most profitable basic cable network during Pittman's tenure there. For his development of the MTV brand, Advertising Age selected Pittman in 2010 as one of the ten most influential marketers who transformed American Culture.
Quantum Media and Time Warner.
After MTV, Pittman founded Quantum Media with MCA (one of the company's ventures was the Morton Downey Jr. show, an early television shock talk show), and in 1989, he bought out MCA, sold the assets to Warner Communications and became senior advisor to Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross just as Warner was merging with Time Inc. to create Time Warner. In 1990, Pittman was appointed President and CEO of Time Warner Enterprises, the new business group of Time Warner, and in 1991 became Chairman and CEO of Six Flags Theme Parks where his team oversaw the revitalization of the Six Flags brand, taking attendance from 17 million to 25 million using a “classic second-place strategy” with their “Bigger than Disneyland, closer to home” positioning of the brand.
Century 21 Real Estate.
After Pittman led a process that led to Time Warner selling a controlling interest in Six Flags to Boston Ventures in 1995, he left to join Century 21 Real Estate as CEO. Pittman and his team grew Century 21 Real Estate through a strategy which included brand-building and national marketing, a new franchise sales organization, and the early adoption of the Internet as a lead-generating tool.
America Online and AOL Time Warner.
While at Century 21, Pittman met Steve Case and joined the board of directors of America Online, Inc.; he joined the company as president of AOL Networks in 1996 and later became President and COO of America Online Inc. While at AOL, Pittman led the operating team that moved AOL from 6 million members to over 30 million; took the company profitable; introduced mass market advertising as a revenue source; and continued the mission of making the Internet as easy for consumers to use as the telephone or television. The company’s most memorable ad of that time had the tagline “America Online: So Easy To Use, No Wonder It’s Number One”. After AOL merged with Time Warner in 2001, Pittman became the Co-COO (and eventually COO) of the combined AOL Time Warner before leaving the company in 2002.
Pilot Group.
Pittman joined a number of his longtime operating team colleagues when he co-founded Pilot Group LLC, a private investment firm based New York in 2003. Pilot and its members have controlling investments in Thrillist, North American Membership Group, Tasting Table, Tequila Casa Dragones, and Pure Wow, and also has stakes in companies including Rapleaf and TrialPay.
Pilot Group previously sold investments that include social gaming company Zynga, in which it was an early investor; David's Bridal; Stereogum; and IdealBite, which was sold to the Walt Disney Company. In August 2008, Pilot Group sold DailyCandy, its initial investment, to Comcast for a reported $125 million. In January 2010, International market-research firm Ipsos acquired OTX Research from Pilot. The company also sold Barrington Broadcasting to Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2013 for $370 million and Double O Radio to companies including Oaktree Capital Management, Powell Broadcasting and Hometown Columbia.
Clear Channel Media Holdings, Inc..
In November 2010, Pittman took on the role of Chairman of Media and Entertainment Platforms for Clear Channel and made a personal equity investment in the Company. In this role, Pittman worked to leverage the Company's media assets and spearhead the further development of a digital strategy for Clear Channel Radio, particularly with regard to its New iHeartRadio digital radio product. Pittman also played a pivotal role in developing the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the biggest live concert festival in radio history, the first of which took place in Las Vegas on September 23–24, 2011.
Bob Pittman is Chairman and CEO of Clear Channel Media Holdings and Executive Chairman of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, and originally served as Chairman of Clear Channel Media and Entertainment Platforms from November 2010 – October 2011. In this role, Pittman oversees all of the company's global media properties including broadcast, digital and mobile, syndication, media representation and Outdoor.
In conjunction with this position, Pittman also maintains his role as Founding Member of Pilot Group and continues his activities as a venture investor; in an indication of his continued interest in emerging technologies and businesses, he also serves on the board of live social video company Airtime. With his return to radio, Huffington Post’s media business expert Charles Warner dubbed him “best radio programmer ever” and in 2011 he was ranked by Radio Ink magazine as the "Most Powerful Man in Radio." "Never before has anyone taken the number one slot on the list in their inaugural year," stated Radio Ink Publisher/CEO B. Eric Rhoads. Pittman retained that designation in 2012.
Recent years.
Pittman is a philanthropist, building community and philanthropic projects into businesses he managed from Live Aid at MTV to educational efforts using the Internet at AOL. He is former chairman of the non-profit Robin Hood Foundation, which fights poverty in New York City, and still serves on the board; and is former chairman of the New York Public Theater.

Uniform 2 k1 polytope

In geometry, 2k1 polytope is a uniform polytope in "n" dimensions ("n" = "k"+4) constructed from the En Coxeter group. The family was named by Coxeter as 2k1 by its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, with a single ring on the end of the 2-node sequence. It can be named by an expoential Schläfli symbol {32,k,1}.
Family members.
The family starts uniquely as 6-polytopes, but can be extended backwards to include the 5-orthoplex (pentacross) in 5-dimensions, and the 4-simplex (5-cell) in 4-dimensions.
Each polytope is constructed from (n-1)-simplex and 2k-1,1 (n-1)-polytope facets, each has a vertex figure as an (n-1)-demicube, "{31,n-2,1}".
The sequence ends with k=6 (n=10), as an infinite hyperbolic tessellation of 9-space.

Thyrocopa

Thyrocopa is a genus of oecophorid moth endemic to Hawaii. The taxon has approximately forty species, including some flightless species.
Adults.
Although some "Agrotis" species occur at very high altitudes in Hawaii and female "Agrotis" from New Zealand are sometimes brachypterous, brachyptery in both sexes of Lepidoptera species is rare and is usually limited to wind-battered habitats, often southern oceanic islands and sparsely vegetated areas where the moths locomote by jumping. "Thyrocopa" includes the only species of flightless alpine moth in the Hawaiian Islands.
Having studied males and females of two different species ("Thyrocopa apatela" and "Thyrocopa kikaelekea"), researchers at University of California, Berkeley concluded that they had not evolved from a flightless common ancestor nor had they dispersed to new habitats after becoming flightless. Rather, each was descended from a flying ancestor but had separately undergone wing reduction and evolved flightlessness in a case of parallel evolution occurring in less than 1 million years. The adaptation is thought to be a response to specific environmental pressures such as scattered food resources, lack of predation, high winds, and low temperatures that elicit loss of flight. Their hypothesis is supported by both molecular and morphological evidence.
Larvae.
An entomologist at the University of Bristol described most larvae of this genus as generalist feeders that eat decaying leaf tissue and generally hide in webby frass structures they make themselves. The larva of an undescribed species has a slightly different appearance from the generalist species and seems to be a specialist borer in "Broussaisia arguta", a perennial native-Hawaiian relative of the Hydrangea.
At 20°C in the laboratory, specimens stayed larvae for 2–20 weeks and remained in pupa form for 2-8, a range in development time indicative of a number of species being kept together in the study.
The larvae have been collected on a wide variety of host plants (most of them endemic to Hawaii) including maile ("Alyxia oliviformis"), painiu ("Astelia argyrocoma"), ākōlea ("Athyrium microphyllum"), "Carex spp.", lapalapa ("Cheirodendron platyphyllum"), pilo ("Coprosma elliptica"), koi ("Coprosma kauensis"), ukiuki ("Dianella sandwicensis"), uluhe ("Dicranopteris linearis"), "Dryopteris spp.", naenae ula ("Dubautia raillardioides"), "Elaphoglossum" spp., manono ("Hedyotis terminalis"), kakaemoa ("Melicope clusiifolia"), ōhia lehua ("Metrosideros polymorpha"), kōlea ("Myrsine punctata"), kōpiko ("Psychotria spp."), sawtooth blackberry ("Rubus argutus"), hoi kuahiwi ("Smilax melastomifolia"), pūkiawe ("Styphelia tameiameiae"), and ohelo kau laau ("Vaccinium calycinum").

Thyrocopa kikaelekea

Thyrocopa kikaelekea, a species of flightless moth from Hawaii in genus "Thyrocopa", was recently discovered by entomologists at University of California, Berkeley and described in a 2008 paper.
The forewing length is 8–11 mm. Adults are active during the day. However, these species may not be strictly diurnal, because they have been reported to be attracted to, and walking or jumping toward, lights at night. Adults are on wing at least from May to September.
The larva makes a silken tunnel under a rock and at the end of it a blind sack in which it pupates. The larvae possibly feed on windblown
debris of "Sophora chrysophylla" or grass such as "Deschampsia".

Pink Plasma

Pink Plasma is the 78th cartoon produced in the "Pink Panther" series. A total of 124 6-minute cartoons were produced between 1964 and 1980.
Plot.
The Pink Panther is backpacking through Transylvania and stops to spend a night at a castle, believing it to be a lodge. It is in fact a vampire's castle also occupied by a hairy, knife-throwing hand, a Yeti-like phantom in squeaky shoes, and a shark in the moat. Thinking the vampire's coffin to be that of a dead man, the Pink Panther buries it. Dusk arrives, the coffin rumbles to surface, and the vampire emerges. The Pink Panther repeatedly tries to repel the vampire. This invariably causes the vampire to go out the window and fall into a moat, where he is preyed on by the shark. By the end, sunrise causes the vampire, shark, phantom, and castle to all disappear.

Springfield Terminal railroad bridge, Deerfield

The Springfield Terminal railroad bridge in Deerfield, Massachusetts is a three-span deck-truss bridge which crosses the Connecticut River.
History.
The railroad crossing at this location dates to 1850 when a branch of the Fitchburg Railroad opened from Grout's Corner west to Greenfield. This line would later connect to the Hoosac Tunnel, which opened to rail traffic in 1875.
Currently, the bridge carries rail traffic in and out of the former Boston & Maine Railroad yard at East Deerfield, MA, which is now owned by Pan Am Railways. It is located at the east end of the yard.

Kampfgeschwader 54

Kampfgeschwader 54 "Totenkopf"() (KG 54) was a Luftwaffe bomber wing during World War II .
Its units participated on all of the fronts in the European Theatre until it was disbanded in May 1945. It operated two of the major German bomber types; the Heinkel He 111 and the Junkers Ju 88. Its unit insignia, sometimes displayed on a shield-like device, but more often depicted over a normal camouflage pattern, bore a strikingly close graphic resemblance to that of the 3rd SS Panzer Division, known by the same name.
History.
"Kampfgeschwader 54" was formed on 1 May 1939 at Fritzlar, Germany with "Stab"./KG 54, II "Gruppe" and III "Gruppe". I "Gruppe" were not formed until December 1939 near Hoya.
Wartime service.
Poland.
Only "2 Staffel" of "I Gruppe" participated in the invasion. The rest of the unit did not participate during the campaign. Instead it was put on standby in western Germany, in case of Allied attack. Among the targets were troop concentrations against Praha on 10 September, and Brest-Litovsk on 15 September. The "Staffel" was withdrawn on 20 September.
Denmark and Norway.
Only II./KG 54 participated, and was put under the command of "X. Fliegerkorps". The "Gruppe" targeted rail links at Dombås-Åndalsnes-Vaalebru, Norway, on 23 April. The "Gruppe" also attacked Dombås railway station on 26 May, and retreating British forces at Namos.
France and the Low Countries.
KG 54 began the campaign in the west with a strength of 106 He 111s and Ju 88s, with 80 serviceable. KG 54 lost 46 bombers, 130 personnel killed, 10 missing, 60 wounded and 188 as POW (some were later released). KG 54 dropped 409 tons of bombs in 1,200 sorties. KG 54 carried out the bombing operation against Rotterdam on 14 May 1940. The city centre was destroyed. Bombs struck vegetable oil storage tanks causing uncontrollable fires. Some 800 Dutch civilians were killed and 78,000 made homeless.
Battle of Britain.
On 11 July IV.(Erg)/KG 54 was created at Lechfeld using some personnel from III./KG 54. Equipped with Ju 88As and He 111Ps the "Staffel" was renamed 10.(Erg)/54.
The unit lost 265 killed, 121 missing, 63 as POWs and 65 wounded as well as 62 aircraft during the operation. I./KG 54 flew 1,189 missions, and lost 27 aircraft and another 27 damaged in July 1940 – May 1941. III./KG 54 lost 9 aircraft, 12 personnel killed, and one wounded (POW figures unknown). It took part in the climax of the air campaign on 15 September 1940, which has become known as the Battle of Britain Day. The day witnessed a series of running, but intense, air battles over London.
KG 54 flew thousands of sorties during The Blitz, hitting targets all over the United Kingdom, including targets as far away as Glasgow, Scotland and Belfast, Northern Ireland in April and May 1941, near the Blitz's conclusion.
Western Front, Channel Front and Atlantic Duties, 1941.
During its time in France, II./KG 54 also attempted to support the German battleship Bismarck during her Atlantic operation during 26–28 May 1941. However, the unit was unable to intervene before she sank.
Operation Barbarossa.
The KG 54 committed 70 aircraft to the initial attack, with 64 serviceable.
On 22 June it attacked airfields at Ovruch and Korosten, in support of Army Group South. The unit also struck Soviet tank concentrations at Lubysza and Rawa Ruzka on 23 June, and Tarnopol on 30 June. Throughout July KG 54 supported the advance toward Kiev. Rail tragets at Zhitomir-Kiev, Kazatin-Fastov, Fastov-Kiev, Korosten-Novograd and Korsun between 8 and 13 July. II./KG 54 lost 12 aircraft during July, during the same period I./KG 54 lost 19.
II./KG 54 lost 24 bombers and 20 damaged. It lost 39 crew members killed, 37 missing, 2 as POWs and 28 wounded.
1942.
II./KG 54, the only unit of the "Geschwader" to operate on the front after "Barbarossa", participated in the Battle of Kharkov (the unit had participated in two of the three battles for the city during the war, in 1941 and 1942) and the Battle of Stalingrad. It reported 32 aircraft losses and 20 damaged, suffered 31 killed, 57 missing and 29 wounded. No personnel were recorded as captured.
The "Geschwader" was withdrawn from Russia on 8 October 1942.
Western Front, Channel Front: 1942.
II./KG 54 briefly returned to British skies in 1942. Between 29 July and 14 August 1942 it lost 6 bombers on missions against Bedford, Birmingham, Norwich, Southend, Hastings and Luton.
It returned to the Eastern Front on 17 August 1942.
Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres.
I./KG 54 supported the "Afrika Korps" from December 1941 - February 1943. The unit flew missions in North Africa and from bases in Sicily against Malta, and later Allied supply convoys. In December 1942 the "Gruppe" was down to just 50 percent of its authorised strength. After refitting in Germany, the "Gruppe" returned to Italy. I./KG 54 then attacked ports along the Allied held coast of North Africa until December.
II./KG also operated in North Africa from October 1942 - May 1943. The "Gruppe" lost 30 machines before its withdrawal.
II./KG 54 then continued operating throughout the Italian Campaign, making all out efforts against Allied shipping, with LT 350 torpedoes in the Gulf of Naples. The "Gruppe" lost 18 Ju 88s during these operations.
The Western front, Normandy Campaign and Operation Steinbock.
I./KG 54 lost 15 aircraft in February–March alone during "Steinbock". Operating from bases in northern Germany (Wittmund, Jever, Marx), the "Gruppe" was rushed to Juvincourt on 6 June 1944, due to the Normandy landings. I./KG 54 operated against the British beachheads, but suffered heavy losses. After just five days, I./KG 54 had lost 13 machines, and II./KG 54 lost a further 10. All "Gruppen" were withdrawn from the Western Front in September 1944. The "Geschwader" began to convert to the Messerschmitt Me 262, as KG(J) 54, during this period.

Bennett's Meadow Bridge

The Route 10 bridge, also known as Bennett's Meadow Bridge is a steel stringer bridge crossing the Connecticut River in the town of Northfield, Massachusetts. The bridge carries state highway Route 10 and was built in 1969.
History.
The town of Northfield first authorized a bridge at or near the site of the current bridge in 1810. The bridge was built by a private corporation with the town holding stock. The new bridge was destroyed in a flood after only a few years. A horse boat ferry, known as Bennett's Meadow Ferry, replaced the river crossing. In 1897, the state legislature authorized Franklin County to construct a second bridge at or near the site of the ferry at a cost not to exceed $35,000. The new bridge was designed by Edward Shaw of Boston and was opened to traffic in 1899. The bridge was one of the first bridges erected by a then novel method without the use of false works that has since become standard procedure. The 1899 bridge was later demolished and a third bridge (the current bridge) was constructed just south of the former bridge, resulting also in the slight realignment of the highway.

Thyrocopa apatela

Thyrocopa apatela, (common names: Grasshopper Moth, and Haleakala flightless moth), is a species of brachypterous (flightless) moth from Maui. Hawaii.
This species appears to be undergoing severe range reduction. Although it was found as low as 1,524 meters in the 1970s, recent collecting indicates it is now restricted to areas above 2,900 meters. This may be the result of the range expansion of introduced ants on Haleakala.
The length of the forewings is 8–11 mm. Adults are on wing from May to August. It is largely diurnal, though they occasionally come to light. Adults are mostly collected while hopping between sunny rocks. 
The larva is likely a generalist, feeding on "Dubautia" and other plant species found in the alpine scrub of Haleakala’s high elevation areas. Larvae have also been found feeding on wind-blown debris under small rocks.

List of locks and dams of the Ohio River

This is a list of locks and dams of the Ohio River, which begins at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at the Point in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and ends at the confluence of the Ohio River and the Mississippi River near Cairo, Illinois.
Evolution of navigation on the Ohio River.
In the early days of steamboat navigation on the Ohio River the major physical hurdle that delayed travel was the Falls of the Ohio near Louisville, Kentucky. Steamboats could only maneuver over the falls during times of high water, which were not consistent. It was more practical for the steamboats to drop off passengers and freight on one end of the falls and transport them over land to the opposite end of the falls to another steamboat. This resulted in Louisville becoming a customary last stop for vessels on both legs of the Ohio. If a steamboat desired to travel unimpeded though the falls without waiting for high water, a canal and lock system was needed in order to circumvent the falls.
In 1825, construction began on that canal, and by 1830 the privately financed Louisville and Portland Canal was finished. The canal was constructed by hand tools with the help of animal-drawn scrappers and carts. The completed canal was two miles long with three locking chambers that created a total lift of 26 feet.
Canalization.
The amount of coal transported down river from Pittsburgh jumped greatly following the Civil War. The size of the tows also grew with the amount of coal hauled. Due to the escalating coal trade the US Army Corps of Engineers began studying for methods to produce a reliable navigation depth on the Ohio. The Corps launched an international study to analyze other navigation projects worldwide. They determined that building a system of locks and dams to form pools was best solution to their problem.
Following the opening of the lock and dam at Davis Island in 1885, the venture proved to be worthy. In 1910, the Rivers and Harbors Act was authorized by Congress. The Act allowed the production of a system of locks and dams along the Ohio. In 1929, the canalization project on the Ohio River was finished. The project produced 51 wooden wicket dams and 600 foot by 110 foot lock chambers along the length of the river.
During the 1940s, a shift from steam propelled to diesel powered towboats allowed for tows longer than the 600 foot locks on the river. This meant barges had to be locked in two phases. This operation was dangerous and time consuming. It backed up river traffic and increased expenses for the towing industry. The Corps initiated the Ohio River Navigation Modernization Program in the 1950s. The programs purpose was to replace the system of outdated wicket dams and small locks. The new dams were non-navigable and made of concrete and steel. Each dam has two adjoining locks, one 600 foot by 110 foot chamber, and a 1200 foot by 110 foot chamber to accommodate fifteen barges that can lock through in one maneuver.

Rockies Express Pipeline

The Rockies Express Pipeline is a long high-speed natural gas pipeline system from the Rocky Mountains, Colorado to eastern Ohio. The pipeline system consists of three sections running through eight states. It is the largest natural gas pipeline built in the United States in more than 20 years, and one of the largest natural gas pipelines ever built in North America. 
Technical description.
The diameter of long pipeline system varies between . The capacity of the pipeline is 16.5 billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas per year. The whole pipeline costs around US$5 billion. The final section of the pipeline was completed on 12 November 2009.
REX — Entrega.
REX — Entrega is the long former Entrega Pipeline between the Meeker Hub in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, and the Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, Colorado. Construction of this pipeline was authorized in August 2005. The pipeline project was acquired by Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC in February 2006. The long segment from the Meeker Hub to the Wamsutter Hub in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, is of pipeline, which is in service since February 2006. The long segment from the Wamsutter Hub to the Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, Colorado, is of pipeline, which is in service since February 2007. 
REX — West.
REX — West is a long pipeline from Weld County, Colorado, to Audrain County, Missouri. It has a long branch connecting pipeline with the Williams Energy owned Echo Springs Processing Plant.
On 31 May 2006, the Rockies Express Pipeline filed an application to construct and operate this section. The construction approval was issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on 20 April 2007. The first long segment of this pipeline was commissioned on 27 December 2007, and the second long segment was commissioned on 16 May 2008. It is in full service since 16 May 2008.
REX — East.
REX — East is a long pipeline from Audrain County, Missouri, to Clarington in Monroe County, Ohio. The Rockies Express Pipeline filed an application to construct and operate this section on 30 April 2007 and the FERC issued approval on 30 May 2008.
Further interconnections.
Several expansion projects have been proposed to transport gas further to northeast. The long Northeast Express project would run from Clarington and Lebanon, Ohio, to Princeton, New Jersey. Other extension project foresees connection of the Rockies Express Pipeline with the Spectra Energy owned Texas Eastern Transmission pipeline. Spectra Energy made a contract with ConocoPhillips, according to which it will expand the Texas Eastern Transmission pipeline by 4 bcm per year to transport Rocky Mountains gas further to Pennsylvania. This expansion, known as TIME III Project, is expected to be commissioned by November 2010. Another Spectra Energy’s project, known as Northern Bridge, will increase the capacity of a pipeline from Clarington, Ohio, to Oakford, Pennsylvania, up to 5 bcm per year by late 2009. El Paso Corporation and Equitable Resources plan to build an long expansion, known as the Northeast Passage Project, from Clarington to Pleasant Valley, New York. Williams Companies is planning the long Rockies Connector Pipeline, which would connect the Rockies Express Pipeline in Clarington with its owned Transcontinental Pipeline in York County, Pennsylvania.
Partnership.
The pipeline is operated by Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC, a partnership between Tallgrass Energy Partners, Phillips 66 and Sempra Energy. In February 2006, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Sempra Energy acquired Entrega Gas Pipeline Inc., from EnCana Corporation. In June 2006, ConocoPhillips acquired 24% of the project. ConocoPhillips spun off the downstream part of its business in May 2012.
Environmental concerns.
The pipeline project has raised some environmental concerns. Ohio officials have asked to avoid crossing the Big Darby Creek in Pickaway County and the Little Miami River in Warren County within Caesar Creek State Park because of the risk of harming fish and other wildlife posed by drilling the pipeline beneath the rivers.
A Lawsuit by American Energy Corporation was filed against REX over the disruption of coal mine owned by AEC beneath REX. In light of past pipeline accidents, where subsiding abandoned mines have caused pipelines to fail, the wisdom of the location of that part of the REX pipeline is of concern to pipeline industry critics.

The Lands of Lochridge

The Lochridge estate was in the old feudal Baillerie of Cunninghame, near Stewarton in what is now East Ayrshire, Scotland.
The history of Lochridge.
Nether Lochridge or Lochrig as it was originally known, belonged to the Arnots for nearly 400 years. Mathew Arnot Stewart, the last direct representative of the family, sold the estate to David Provan, a surgeon, in 1830. Robertson (1820) shows an Upper Lochridge as well as Lochridge. This property seems to be at the site of what is now called Draffen House. Colonel Barns owned Upper Lochrig, part of Auchenharvie and Kirkland in 1820. A Hugh Wyllie who died on 22 December 1823, aged 51, is recorded on his tombstone in the Laigh Kirk churchyard in Stewarton as having lived at Over Lochridge.
In 1691 the Hearth Tax records show that the mansion house had seven hearths and that seven other dwellings were associated with the estate.
Mr. J. Proven of Lochridge attended the famous 1839 Eglinton Tournament in what is now Eglinton Country Park and he was alloted a seat in the Grand Stand.
It is stated locally that a Lochridge Halt existed on the railway at one time, but no evidence has yet been found to support this. The new junction on the doubled track from Stewarton to Lugton is officially known as 'Lochridge Junction'.
Wardhead, next to Lochridge, was farmed by Alexander Cameron and his spouse Janet Ingrwm in the early 18th. century. Alexander died on 5 April 1761 and Janet died on 20 May 1736, aged 50. They were both buried at the Laigh Kirk in Stewarton.
This was a dower house or factor's residence on the Lochridge Estate and was built around 1860. The older farmhouse building may be incorporated at the back. An old walled garden was later used as a car park. It is now the site of Provan Engineering that manufactures wind turbines.
The Micro history of Lochridge.
The term 'Lochridge' or 'Lockridge' is used as a rare surname, appearing 319 in 88.7 million of the 1997 US population.
The estate stands on a pronounced ridge and the 'Loch' may refer to Lambroughton Loch which may have reached this site.
Robert Burness, the poet's uncle, lived at Titwood near Kilmaurs for several years and worked in the lime quarries at Lochridge until he was crippled with arthritis or rheumatism and moved to Stewarton.
In 1820 only six people were qualified to vote as freeholders in Stewarton Parish, being proprietors of Lochridge (Stewart), Robertland (Hunter Blair), Kirkhill (Col.J.S.Barns), Kennox (McAlester), Lainshaw (Cunninghame), and Corsehill (Montgomery Cunninghame). Dunlop had only two people qualified to vote by right as freeholders.
The Draffen Stone used to be located in a field near the house of the same name. Due to a housing development it has been moved to a site in front of Draffen House. It is not known whether this stone is merely a 'rubbing stone' for cattle or a menhir. It is not recorded by Historic Scotland.
The Stewarton Cricket Club had its grounds located between Lochridge and Ward Park.
The road from Stewarton to Kilmaurs did not run via Lochridge until the 18th century when the Toll Road was built. The old driveway from Lochridge to Stewarton came out near Peter's Brae planting; the original entrance is still present today (2008). The course of the drive was altered when the railway was built in the 1840.
In February 2009 the Lochrig or Lochridge Burn was severely polluted with diesel oil spilled from a train derailed at the railway bridge near Peacockbank farm. Mitigation measures were put in place, however pollution eventually reached the River Irvine.

La Proveedora

La Proveedora is an archeological site located some 15 kilometers west of the city of Caborca, Sonora, México, on the “La Proveedora” and “San José” hills within the “Rancho Puerto Blanco” Ejido, where most of these petroglyphs are located.
It is considered the area with a large petroglyphs concentration. The art is embodied in many hills of the area known as the “Proveedora”, an old copper mine. It remains impossible to establish their age, origin, meaning and all needed to know. Assumptions and deductions can be made, but there are no scientifically proven conclusions. For now these can only be admiring and imagining.
The Trincheras culture site is located between two mountain massifs west of Caborca. It is the most spectacular sites with pre-Hispanic, as engravings practically cover the slopes of two hills.
The number of petroglyphs is not known, there are thousands. There are a variety of motifs: animal groups, geometric designs, suns and moons astronomical representations of, bows, arrows, hunting scenes, etc. There is also an interesting diversity headdresses and head ornaments.
Archeology in Sonora.
The Sonora archaeological heritage has a huge time depth, as demonstrated by evidence left by groups that 13,000 years ago populated this region. Towards northern Sinaloa and the coastal plains of the Fuerte, Mayo and Yaqui rivers, to the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental, developed the Huatabampo tradition, formed by communities that farmed cotton, corn, beans and pumpkin, by taking advantage of a large variety of coastal resources.
Towards the east is the “Serrana Tradición”, on which after 1,000 A.D., changes in housing types are seen, these are built on surface, with walls resting on stone foundations. The best known site of this tradition is in Baviácora, in the municipality with the same name.
Towards the northeastern end of the state, in the river Bavispe, Bacerac, Huachinera and Sahuaripa basins, are communities very similar to prehispanic sites as Casas Grandes, although it seems to constitute a different tradition which might be termed Carretas. These little hierarchical settlement societies combined occupation of villages on river terraces with adobe houses in caves, possibly for winter use.
Towards the Northwest of Sonora in the basins of the rivers Magdalena, Concepción, Imuris, altar and Cucurpe, there are trinchera culture communities, whose villages with hole houses became more numerous after 700 AD.
Sonora has numerous sites with engraved or painted rock designs, the best known are “La Proveedora” in the trinchera tradition region and “La Pintada”, in the Central Coast area.
The Site.
There are many animal shapes, mainly Pronghorn and bighorn sheep (typical of the region), almost always in herds and sometimes depicting pregnant bellies. There is a coyote figure, a bird of prey (eagle) type face and turtles. There are solitary human figures and family groups with man, woman and children clearly distinguished. The human silhouette is made with lines, round heads and elongated necks. Also are many geometric figures representing circular spirals or square, tribal and Suns figures. A very interesting figure representing a sea shell necklace, an ornamental element widely used by civilizations inhabiting the Gulf of California coast and also coincides with the commercial and cultural trade in the Trincheras culture.
There are several scientific studies that some anthropologists and higher education institutions have made of the evidence of these ancient civilizations. Nonetheless, there are some contradictions and disagreements among some of the data -such as the age and meaning of these carvings- that do not allow us to make a reliable judgment about them. At a local level, however, those of us who live here and have very close and constant contact and personal experience with these drawings find it more comfortable, logical, and acceptable to give a simple and basic interpretation of the drawings, such as: goats, turtles, hunts, dances, moons, suns, directions, dates, and also artistic expression.
Professor Manuel Jorge González Montesinos from the University of Sonora has published a short easy to understand essay about the carvings. This work helps us sustain the following thesis: the region was inhabited by the Mogollon culture civilizations from the year 600 BC to 1400 AD.; by the Anasazi Culture from the year 100 BC., to 1450 AD.; by the Hohokam Culture from 300 BC., to 1400 AD., and also from 800 to 1200 AD.
Settlers were hunter-gatherer desert people with agricultural knowledge; established important irrigation systems for maize cultivation; developed the ability to design and use solar calendars engraved in stone, which indicated the beginning of the seasons of the year. These three cultures established a large communications network and roads that allowed them to develop a far-reaching commercial, cultural and social trade agreements among them. Trade products were baskets and woven objects, ceramics, corn, ritual ornaments, turquoise, seashells, salt, and even knowhow and production technical.
The Trincheras civilization is located in the village of Trincheras, Sonora, actually owes its name to the peculiar type of constructions, placed at different levels on the hill that is close to the village. It seems to be a center for gathering and trade used often by these ancient settlers; which is why it was inhabited almost permanently. The constructions in the shape of trenches, in addition to being the place of dwelling for the settlers -because of the security the height afforded and their design geared for defense- were also places for observation and the celebration of ritual ceremonies.
Abundance of water during springtime due to the fact that the river was very near, made it a wise choice for long stays, as can be seen by plenty of indigenous tombs, remains of ceramic and stone artifacts that are found in the village's surrounding area.
Studies made for dating these settlements have been made -among other methods- by the tree-ring dating method on tree trunks. It has been concluded that Trincheras, Sonora as well as Snaketown, Arizona (south of Phoenix) are contemporary, dating back to 800 and 1200A.D. It is probable that the site was a commercial trade center among the dwellers of the north and those from the south, this is evidenced by the discovery of quetzal feathers in native tombs of those days. This type of bird could only be found in places like Oaxaca hundreds of miles away on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico. These feathers were highly priced by the Anasazi as well as by the Hohokam.
The Hohokam from southwest Arizona and northwest Sonora, constantly traveled to the sea to gather seashells and salt. The sites near Caborca which show traces of their passage and very probably flourished from the center of Trincheras, and it is almost certain that these sites were used only on temporary stays during those journeys to the sea. A great quantity of pieces of broken pots painted in the characteristic colors of those civilizations: red, ocher, purple, and brown can be easily found; seashells, grinding stones (Metate), axes, and other stone tools are not as easily found.
Rock Art.
The figures carved on the rocks were made by direct percussion -very similar to chiseling- and they represent animals, human figures, frets, mazes, geometric shapes, heavenly bodies, and probably waves of the sea or aquatic symbols. The possible interpretations of these artistic manifestations made by the Hohokam could be any of the following: ritual scenes or ceremonies, retelling of a hunt, desert plants and animals, names of groups or tribes, calendars or dates, indicators of routes, changes in seasons or weather, or just plain art for its own sake.
The Hohokam civilization probably declined because of illnesses or prolonged droughts that greatly reduced the tribal groups. But they definitely are the ancestors of the current inhabitants of the Tohono O'odham nation (people of the desert) more commonly known as pápagos. Although it is well known that they do not like being given that name.

Uniform 1 k2 polytope

In geometry, 1k2 polytope is a uniform polytope in n-dimensions (n = k+4) constructed from the En Coxeter group. The family was named by Coxeter as 1k2 by its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, with a single ring on the end of the 1-node sequence. It can be named by an exponential Schläfli symbol {31,k,2}.
Family members.
The family starts uniquely as 6-polytopes, but can be extended backwards to include the 5-demicube (demipenteract) in 5-dimensions, and the 4-simplex (5-cell) in 4-dimensions.
Each polytope is constructed from 1k-1,2 and (n-1)-demicube facets. Each has a vertex figure of a "{31,n-2,2}" polytope is a birectified n-simplex, "t2{3n}".
The sequence ends with k=6 (n=10), as an infinite tessellation of 9 dimensional hyperbolic space.

List of Oklahoma City Thunder head coaches

The Oklahoma City Thunder is an American professional basketball franchise based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It plays in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). It was known as the Seattle SuperSonics from 1967 to 2008. The team plays its home games at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. As of October 2008, the Thunder is currently owned by Professional Basketball Club LLC and coached by Scott Brooks, with Sam Presti as its general manager. The team was formed in 1967. After spending 41 years in Seattle, Washington, the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City. Owner Clay Bennett, who purchased the team in 2006, sought to get public funding for a new arena in Seattle, or a major renovation of the KeyArena in 2007. After failing to do so, he decided to move the team to Oklahoma City. Seattle sued Bennett's group to enforce the lease that required the team to stay until 2010. The two sides reached a $45 million settlement to pay off the team's lease with KeyArena in July 2008.
There have been 16 head coaches for the Thunder franchise. The franchise won its only NBA championship in the 1979 NBA Finals while coached by Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens. Wilkens is the only member of the franchise to have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach. He is also the franchise's all-time leader in regular-season games coached, regular-season games won, playoff games coached, and playoff games won. Wilkens, Nate McMillan and Bob Weiss formerly played for the team in Seattle. Current head coach Scott Brooks is the only coach to have won the NBA Coach of the Year Award with the franchise.

Earthquake resistant structures

Earthquake-resistant structures are structures designed to withstand earthquakes. While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of earthquake-resistant construction is to erect structures that fare better during seismic activity than their conventional counterparts.
According to building codes, earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of functionality should be limited for more frequent ones.
To combat earthquake destruction, the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last, often by making them excessively stiff and strong, like the El Castillo pyramid at Chichen Itza. 
Currently, there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be strong and ductile enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage, to equipping it with base isolation or using structural vibration control technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and the Acropolis Museum.
Trends, projects.
Some of the new state-of-the-art trends and/or projects in the field of earthquake engineering structures are presented below.
Proofed earthquake building material.
A German composite construction company developed a proofed earthquake-safe supported core material - based on internal beam/frame constructions. The same principle allows construction of hurricane-safe houses.
Earthquake shelter.
One Japanese construction company has developed a six-foot cubical shelter, presented as an alternative to earthquake-proofing an entire building.
Concurrent shake-table testing.
Concurrent shake-table testing of two or more building models is a vivid, persuasive and effective way to validate earthquake engineering solutions experimentally.
Thus, two wooden houses built before adoption of the 1981 Japanese Building Code were moved to E-Defense for testing (see both pictures aside). The left house was reinforced to enhance its seismic resistance, while the other one was not. These two models were set on E-Defense platform and tested simultaneously [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc652Zp5qWk&feature=PlayList&p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&index=182.
Combined vibration control solution.
Designed by architect Merrill W. Baird of Glendale, working in collaboration with A. C. Martin Architects of Los Angeles, the Municipal Services Building at 633 East Broadway, Glendale was completed in 1966 [http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/planning/MSB%20EIR/AppendixB.pdf]. Prominently sited at the corner of East Broadway and Glendale Avenue, this civic building serves as a heraldic element of Glendale’s civic center.
In October 2004 Architectural Resources Group (ARG) was contracted by Nabih Youssef & Associates, Structural Engineers, to provide services regarding a historic resource assessment of the building due to a proposed seismic retrofit.
In 2008, the Municipal Services Building of the City of Glendale, California was seismically retrofitted using an innovative combined vibration control solution: the existing elevated building foundation of the building was put on high damping rubber bearings.
Steel plate shear walls system.
A steel plate shear wall (SPSW) consists of steel infill plates bounded by a column-beam system. When such infill plates occupy each level within a framed bay of a structure, they constitute a SPSW system. Whereas most earthquake resistant construction methods are adapted from older systems, SPSW was invented entirely to withstand seismic activity.
SPSW behavior is analogous to a vertical plate girder cantilevered from its base. Similar to plate girders, the SPSW system optimizes component performance by taking advantage of the post-buckling behavior of the steel infill panels.
The Ritz-Carlton/JW Marriott hotel building, a part of the LA Live development in Los Angeles, California, is the first building in Los Angeles that uses an advanced steel plate shear wall system to resist the lateral loads of strong earthquakes and winds.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant is partially upgraded.
The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear generating station in the world by net electrical power rating, happened to be near the epicenter of the strongest Mw 6.6 July 2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake. This initiated an extended shutdown for structural inspection which indicated that a greater earthquake-proofing was needed before operation could be resumed.
On May 9, 2009, one unit (Unit 7) was restarted, after the seismic upgrades. The test run had to continue for 50 days. The plant had been completely shut down for almost 22 months following the earthquake.
Seismic Test of Seven-Story Building.
A destructive earthquake struck a lone, wooden condominium in Japan The experiment was webcast live on July 14, 2009 to yield insight on how to make wooden structures stronger and better able to withstand major earthquakes [http://www.nsf.gov/news/newsmedia/neeswood.
The Miki shake at the Hyogo Earthquake Engineering Research Center is the capstone experiment of the four-year NEESWood project, which receives its primary support from the U.S. National Science Foundation Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Program.
“NEESWood aims to develop a new seismic design philosophy that will provide the necessary mechanisms to safely increase the height of wood-frame structures in active seismic zones of the United States, as well as mitigate earthquake damage to low-rise wood-frame structures,” said Rosowsky, Department of Civil Engineering at Texas A&M University. This philosophy is based on the application of seismic damping systems for wooden buildings. The systems, which can be installed inside the walls of most wooden buildings, include strong metal frame, bracing and dampers filled with viscous fluid.

Helsinki harbour rail

The Helsinki harbour rail () was a side rail track in Helsinki, Finland, built in the 1890s, and dismantled in 2009. Originally it led from the Helsinki Central railway station, via the city's coastline, to Katajanokka. Its original length was , but in its final stage, its length was only about . The track had two level crossings and a rail yard in the harbour. Near the start of the track were the former VR warehouses. It was used only by trains going to the harbour, but special request trains have also travelled the track.
History.
The construction of the harbour rail began in 1891, although the first plans for the track had been made in 1870. The first train to Eteläsatama ran in December 1893 and the track was inaugurated in the next spring, on 8 April 1894, when it reached the old sales hall. The extension of the track to Katajanokka was completed in September 1895. The length of the new track was and it included of side tracks. The track also included Finland's first, 74 metres long, railway tunnel to Kaivopuisto, and the present underpass of the track under Mannerheimintie was Finland's first concrete bridge.
Originally, the track continued from Ruoholahti via Hietalahti to Merisatama in the middle of Telakkakatu and from there onwards along the edge of Kaivopuisto to the tip of Katajanokka. It was then around 7 km long. The track had a tunnel south of the Olympiaterminaali, and at the Market Square there were two turning bridges at the Cholera basin and at the Katajanokka canal, and one in Hietalahti. Even in the middle 1970s one could see the supervisor engine of the harbour in the middle of the Market Square going to fetch cargo cars from Katajanokka, or pushing a long line of cars over the Market Square turning bridge in either direction.
After Eteläsatama was put solely to passenger traffic, the harbour cranes and the track were dismantled in 1972. When the "Finnjet" was built, there was a public presentation of a plan to put the harbour rail to passenger use in a similar way as in Turku, where passenger trains go to the harbour. These plans were not realised, but the track was begun to be dismantled in front of the Finnjet terminal in Katajanokka in 1977. The cargo traffic to Katajanokka finally stopped on 1 May 1980. After this, only one Dm9 request train ever visited the Market Square. The harbour rail was closed with a stop disc at the eastern end of Merisatama, but the track leading to Eteläsatama remained in place, disused, for several years. The track to Katajanokka was dismantled by 1985, and in 1989 the turning bridge crossing the Katajanokka canal was replaced by a light traffic bridge. At the same time, the part of the track on the edge of Kaivopuisto was dismantled.
The part of the track leading from Ruoholahti to the Merisatama track yard, and the side track from there to the Aker Yards dock, were in use until 2005. The dismantling of this track was started in July 2008.
In 1925, there was also a side track from Ruoholahti to Salmisaari. It was used for cargo traffic for the Alko factories and the Nokia cable factory. These side tracks were dismantled from 1990 to 1993. Also the harbour tracks on the eastern edge of Jätkäsaari were dismantled in the 1990s.
In the 1950s, it was possible that some week's last train, carrying a heavy load of coal cargo, was pulled from Jätkäsaari to Pasila by two Vr3 engines, causing even the windows of Eduskuntatalo to shake and the chasm between the two parallel Rautatienkatu (Railway Street) streets to fill with black coal smoke.
The track did not have official stations or stops, because its main use was cargo traffic, passenger traffic was agreed separately each time, including a separate train sender; most of the time the place of agreement was in Katajanokka.
The last passenger train to visit Katajanokka was a Dm9 unit, travelling on request. Despite the dismantling of the track from Merisatama onwards, rails have survived in the Market Square.
The surviving part of the track was dismantled in May 2009, after the harbour facilities were moved from Länsisatama to the Vuosaari harbour. The chasm between Pohjoinen Rautatienkatu and Eteläinen Rautatienkatu (Northern Railway Street and Southern Railway Street) is planned to be filled with a light traffic line and a light rail line.
Commemorating the track is a water supply crane in Katajanokka, adored with a memorial plaque.
