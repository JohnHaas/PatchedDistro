Bajazet (play)

Bajazet is a tragedy by Jean Racine in five acts (composed of 4, 5, 8, 7, and 12 scenes, respectively), in Alexandrian verse, first played at the Hotel de Bourgogne, on January 5, 1672, after "Berenice", and before "Mithridate". Like Aeschylus in "The Persians", Racine took his subject from contemporary history, taking care to choose a far off location, the Ottoman Empire. In 1635, the sultan Murad IV (Amurat, in the work of Racine) had his brothers and potential rivals Bajazet and Orcan executed. Racine was inspired by this deed, and centered his play on Bajazet. Racine also develops several romantic subplots in the seraglio. The action is particularly complex, and can only be resolved by a series of deaths and suicides.
The initial success of the play was not prolonged. Today, it is one Racine's least played pieces. The character of Bajazet in the opera of the same name by Antonio Vivaldi is not the same as the protagonist of Racine. The play was translated into English by Alan Hollinghurst. This translation was published by Chatto & Windus in 1991. In 2011 Pennsylvania State University Press published an English translation of the play by Geoffrey Alan Argent in iambic pentameter couplets.

El Punt

El Punt (, meaning in English "The Point") is a Catalan daily newspaper based in Girona, Catalonia (Spain). The newspaper was renamed in 1990 from the original Punt Diari ('Daily Point').
History.
The newspaper was founded on 24 February 1979. In the beginning the paper was only circulated in the province of Girona, but from 11 September 2004 it became available in the province of Barcelona. By 2008 it had seven editions: Barcelona, Girona, Barcelonès nord, Maresme, Camp de Tarragona-Terres de l'Ebre, Penedès, and Vallès Occidental.
The Catalan government subsidises with important amounts those Catalan newspapers with at least one Catalan language edition. In 2008, El Punt was the most subsidised of them all in terms of circulation/funds granted, having received almost 2 million euros, which amounts to 72 euros a year per newspaper sold per day, or almost 20 Euro cent per newspaper actually sold.
"El Punt" is currently the most widely sold newspaper with only a Catalan language edition, after having beat (and eventually bought) its peer "Avui". In 2013 it published a controversial cartoon which depicted "Marca España", a government initiative created to improve Spain's image abroad, on a railway line destined to crash. It was published just days after the Santiago train derailment. The newspaper claimed the cartoon was published erroneously, but in the following days the newspaper's building in Barcelona was vandalised with graffiti which stated: "No one laughs at the solidarity and blood of the Spanish people."

8th Military Police Brigade (United States)

The 8th Military Police Brigade is a military police brigade of the United States Army based at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. It is responsible for military police units in the Pacific Ocean region.
Activated during the Vietnam War, the 8th Military Police Brigade was specifically organized to provide planning, direction and supervision for the criminal investigation work required by the US Army in Vietnam. It took over from a provisional Military Police Group (Criminal Investigation) that had been formed on 3 November 1966 in charge of all criminal investigative work in Vietnam, except for the metropolitan Saigon area.
In July 1972, it became the basis for the US Army Criminal Investigation Center, Vietnam Field Office
It served in the region for several years and earning ten campaign streamers before being deactivated during the US forces pullout from the region. The brigade was reactivated in Korea in the 1980s to provide command and control for all US Pacific military police forces, and has since been moved to Hawaii, where much of US Army Pacific is located. The brigade is currently deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Organization.
The Brigade is a subordinate unit of US Army Pacific and the Eighth United States Army. It falls under the direct command of the 8th Theater Sustainment Command.
Currently, the 8th Military Police Brigade consists of one battalion: 728th Military Police Battalion, which contains the 57th, 58th, 552nd, 558th Military Police companies and the 39th and 13th Military Police detachments.
History.
Vietnam War.
The 8th Military Police Group was originally constituted on 8 April 1967 in the regular army and activated on 26 July at Fort Riley, Kansas. After seeing only five months of duty, the group was again deactivated on 18 December of that year. 
On 24 August 1968 the group was again activated, this time in Vietnam. Its activation was part of a larger activation of several military police groups in the region to provide greater command and control for Military Police operating throughout the region. As such, the headquarters element took command of military police units already operating in the country. The Brigade provided policing duties, based in Long Binh along with the 89th Military Police Group. During that time it was a subordinate unit of the 18th Military Police Brigade. It received its distinctive unit insignia on 12 November 1969. The group operated in Vietnam until the pullout of US forces from the nation, receiving ten campaign streamers for its role in the conflict.
Reactivation in Korea.
The 8th Military Police Brigade (Provisional) was constituted in Korea in September 1984 in response to the need for cohesive command and control element in the event of war, for the numerous non-divisional Military Police units on the peninsula. At the time it consisted of the 94th Military Police Battalion in Yongsan (Seoul) and the 728th Military Police Battalion in Taegu (Camp Walker). However, the brigade would remain provisional and would not be officially activated for another ten years while it operated in this capacity.
In 1995, the concept plan was approved for the activation of a military police brigade headquarters in Korea. The 8th MP Brigade was officially activated on 16 April 1996 to provide command and control for the 728th Military Police Battalion and the 94th Military Police Battalion in armistice and to serve as the theater military police brigade during hostilities. The same day, it received its shoulder sleeve insignia. 
In July 2006, the 8th MP Brigade Headquarters and the 728th MP Battalion were reassigned to US Army Pacific and moved from Korea to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. It was placed under the command of the newly created 8th Theater Sustainment Command. The command is responsible for preparing the 25th Infantry Division and other 8th Army units for worldwide deployment.
War on Terrorism.
Subordinate units of the brigade's 728th MP Battalion deployed to Iraq in October 2004 to provide military police duties while the Army formed a clear rotational schedule for MP units coming and going from the country during Operation Iraqi Freedom. In October 2007, the Brigade again deployed elements of the 728th MP Battalion to Iraq for 15 months in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The units suffered several casualties, including soldiers killed in ambushes and vehicle accidents.
Brigade headquarters are scheduled to deploy to Iraq in fall 2008 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In July 2008, the 8th MP Brigade began its move into Iraq with a pre-deployment site survey to support the upcoming deployment into the country. The brigade headquarters was set to replace the 18th Military Police Brigade, which ended its deployment in fall of 2008. The 8th MP brigade will continue the training and expansion of the national Iraqi Police force in the Baghdad area. On 2 December, the brigade officially took control from the 18th MP brigade and began its deployment.

Bhairavi (Carnatic)

Bhairavi is a "janya" rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). Though it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (scale having all 7 notes), it has two different "dhaivathams" in its scale making it a Bhashanga Ragam, and hence is not classified as a "melakarta" rāgam (parent scale).
This is one of the ancient rāgams, said to have been prevalent about 1500 years ago. There are numerous compositions in this rāgam.
Though a Raga called Bhairavi also exists in Hindusthani music, it is very different from the Carnatic version. Hindusthani's Bhairavi, in terms of its aroha and avaroha alone, corresponds to Carnatic music's Thodi.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is considered a "janya" of the 20th "melakarta Natabhairavi". Its "" structure is as follows (see "swaras" of Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
The other set of ārohaṇa and avarohaṇa used is:
The notes used are "chathusruthi rishabham, sadharana gandharam, shuddha madhyamam,
chathusruthi dhaivatham & shuddha dhaivatham" and "kaishika nishadham". Note the use of both "dhaivathams", "chathusruthi" (D2) in ' and "shuddha" (D1) in '.
While a janya of Natabhairavi melam, Bhairavi takes the anya swaram D2 in the ascent in the phrase P D2 N2 S. In descent as well as in the phrase P D N D P the D1 of the parent scale is used. Only R2 and M1 can be prolonged without gamakam. In the ascent G2 is held in conjunction with R2 with short or wide range of oscillation-the later as S G R G M. The gamakam on G ends in R. In descent the phrase M P G R is also used and G2 slides from M1 and oscillates. The phrase S G R G in the ascent and the ending of gamakam on G at R help to avoid flavour of Kharaharapriya which does not use S G R G and in which gamakam on G can end in G itself. Bhairavi is distinguished from Mukhaari by the use of the phrases P D2 N2 S and S G2 R2 G2 M1. The deft use of gamakams in handling G2 N2 D2 and D1 gives the raagam its flavour.
Elaboration and related ragas.
Bhairavi is one of the most popular ragas on the concert stage, due to its very wide scope for improvisation. This raga can be elaborated to beautiful effect in all three sthayis, but shines particularly well in the upper madhya and thara sthayis. The nishada, an important jeeva swara, can be rendered with varying degrees of gamaka, depending on which daivatha is used. The weight of this raga and the lack of vakra sancharas make brighas and slower phrases equally appealing. This characteristic also means that the raga is well-suited to thanam, kanakku, and sarvalaghu swaras. Bhairavi is also one of the most common ragas in which ragam-thanam-pallavi is rendered, due to the scope for elaboration. There is a near-infinite number of compositions in this raga, which can be sung at any time of day. 
Ragas which have similar murchanas and/or anya swara patterns to Bhairavi include Manji, Mukhari, and Huseni. 
Popular Compositions.
"Bhairavi" has been decorated with numerous compositions by almost all composers. "Viriboni" "varnam" in "ata talam" by Pacchimiriam Adiyappa is commonly sung at the beginning of a concert and is very popular. Given below are a few very popular compositions among the 100s in this ragam.

Catriona Sturton

Catriona Sturton (born June 8, 1976) is an Ottawa, Ontario–based singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. She has had a prolific career, performing in bands such as Plumtree and collaborating with artists like Joel Plaskett, Al Tuck, the late Dutchy Mason, the Mighty Popo and members of Sloan and Blue Rodeo. She is currently working on a solo project.
Early musical development.
Sturton got her start at an early age when her parents put her into classical violin lessons for eight years. In her teens, while shopping for some fiddle music, she saw a harmonica and bought it. This led to a passion for the Blues, and she quickly acquired proficiency with the instrument. Her adolescence was spent under the tutelage of local Ottawa harp legend Larry "The Bird" Mootham and performing in and around Ottawa at various blues bars such as The Whipping Post, The Rainbow and Tucson's.
Past projects.
When Sturton left Ottawa to study History at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, she took up the bass guitar and joined the indie all-girl band Plumtree. With the band, she released and recorded two albums, won a YTV Yaa! Achievement Award and toured extensively around Canada with others, like Thrush Hermit and the Weakerthans. Plumtree also inspired the comic series entitled "Scott Pilgrim," named after their hit song. She claims that she used the experience to cut her teeth on the rigours of songwriting, traveling, marketing and other aspects of being a touring musician. In 2000, she moved to Japan to teach English and met Sonnet Bingham from Arizona. Together with two locals they started The Secret, a bilingual J-Pop influenced Garage band and toured Japan and Canada. This was the first instance where she sang lead vocals in a band setting, previously being nervous about her abilities. Her newfound role also was a major push towards perfecting her song writing.
Current musical projects.
Currently, Sturton works for a non-profit literary foundation, a job that grew out of her past musical experience. Her work allows her to travel across Canada to help promote literacy in small communities. She has been focusing on her solo career as a performing song writer and is in the process of preparing material for upcoming collaborations. She performs regularly with Ottawa blues singer/guitarist John Carroll.
Multi-instrumentalist.
The first instrument Sturton studied seriously was the harmonica. During her teen years, she wanted to be a professional blues harp player and since then, has studied with Larry "The Bird" Mootham and Cuban-Canadian harmonica virtuoso Carlos Del Junco. She frequently gives harmonica workshops and has backed many artists such as Al tuck and Neko Case. During her time at Dalhousie University, she learned the bass and took over that duty with Plumtree and The Secret. In Japan, she enrolled in an intensive apprenticeship to learn a zen form of Shamisen, a traditional Japanese instrument with healing properties. She has performed in and around Hiroshima. Sturton also plays the guitar and uses the instrument for her solo performances. She started singing at a very late age after being nervous about her voice but the time she spent in Japan taught her that there was an appreciation for her vocal style. Currently, she is studying the accordion after having desired to do so her entire life.
Musical style.
Sturton's solo work finds its sonic roots within all the styles in which she has worked. Many of her songs constitute of overdubbed tracks, with her playing every single instrument. Her voice has an innocent, sometimes hyper active, quality to it which makes it very distinguishable and a great addition to her overall sound signature. It was developed during her time in Japan where her vocal style was appreciated and encouraged.

C'mon and Love Me

"C'mon and Love Me" is a 1975 single by the American rock band Kiss. It was originally featured on the group's third album "Dressed to Kill".
Background.
Written by Paul Stanley in under an hour, a live version of the track exists on "Alive!". Stanley was inspired by the Moody Blues song "Question" when composing the tune.
The lyrics are a playful narrative portraying a Don Juan who takes the unique tack of offering himself up to his romantic prey: "Baby, baby don't you hesitate/'Cause I just can't wait/Lady, won't you take me down to my knees/You can do what you please/C'mon and Love Me."
"C'mon and Love Me" became a favorite in concert and a regular part of Kiss' 1970s performances. It has retained a cult following among the ensemble's fans and was later covered by Skid Row (this rendition can be found on "B-Side Ourselves").
Reception.
"C'mon and Love Me" underperformed on the singles listings and did not chart.
Appearances.

USS Nicollet (AG-93)

USS "Nicollet" (AK-199/AG-93/AVS-6) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship acquired by the U.S. Navy shortly before the end of World War II. She was configured to carry aviation parts and spares, and to issue them to the Pacific fleet and activities as needed.
Career.
"Nicollet" (AK-199) was laid down 9 February 1944 for the U.S. Maritime Commission as M.C. hull 2153 by Globe Shipbuilding Corporation; named "Nicollet" 25 February 1944; launched 31 July 1944 as "AK-199"; sponsored by Mrs. F. C. Hanson; converted for Navy use by Samuelson Shipyard, Beaumont, Texas, and Brown Shipyard, Houston, Texas; redesignated "AG–93" on 12 March 1945; and commissioned 27 April Lt. F. M. Bible in command.
After shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico "Nicollet" was reclassified "AVS–6" effective 25 May 1945. Steaming to the Pacific Ocean, she arrived in the forward area and was assigned to Commander, Air Forces, Subordinate Command Forward, Pacific Fleet. She operated out of Apra Harbor, Guam.
"Nicollet" followed closely behind the invasion forces to supply newly acquired airstrips and aviation activities with spare parts and other needs. She salvaged goods, returned materials for repair and eventual re-use, and supplied aircraft carriers at sea.
At the end of hostilities she continued to support naval and marine air groups, both carrier and land-based. In April 1946 she returned to the U.S. West Coast via Pearl Harbor. Following a cruise to the Gulf of Mexico, she sailed again to the western Pacific Ocean.
Returning to San Francisco, California, she decommissioned and was returned to the War Shipping Administration 17 June. She was struck from the Navy Register 3 July and sold to France on 24 July.

Torque effect

The torque effect experienced in helicopters and single propeller-powered aircraft is a result of Isaac Newton's third law of motion that "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"
In helicopters, the result of the torque effect is a tendency of the main rotor to want to turn the fuselage in the opposite direction from the rotor. 
In a single-propeller plane, the result of the torque effect is a tendency of the plane to want to turn upwards and left in response to the propeller wanting to turn (bank) the plane in the opposite direction of the propeller spin.

She (Kiss song)

"She" is a song by American hard rock group Kiss. It was released on the band's third studio album "Dressed to Kill" in 1975. The song was written by Gene Simmons and Stephen Coronel while Simmons was in a band called "Bullfrog Bheer". Although released in 1975, Kiss performed "She" on previous tours, but removed from the setlist during the 1980s and the 1990s.
Background.
The originator of the song is Stephen Coronel with Gene Simmons contributing the words and lyrics at an evenings rehearsal with Wicked Lester. The song was originally called "She Walks By Moonlight" because of a line in a movie Hondo where, as Simmons said:
"'I want your daughter.' chief said: 'You may not have my daughter.' cowboy said: 'Why not?' chief said: 'She walks by moonlight.' And that's the first line of the song. I didn't even know what it meant, I just loved the sound of it."
The line "she's no good" was changed to "she's so good". The Wicked Lester's version of the song length is 3:07, while the "Dressed to Kill" version is 4:08 long. Also, Kiss version lacks the congas and flute. Congas were played by session musician Jimmy Maelen.
Ace Frehley's solo in the song is based on Robby Krieger's solo in The Doors' song "Five to One", it starts in the same key and tempo; and is self-admittedly "copied" by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam on their song "Alive".
"She" is one of only three Kiss songs taken from Wicked Lester existence, with others being the "Hotter Than Hell" "Goin' Blind" and the other one "Dressed to Kill" "Love Her All I Can". "She" and "Love Her All I Can" were intended to be on "Hotter Than Hell" album, but the band already had enough material for the album.
Live performances.
Although not released officially until 1975, Kiss played "She" on previous tours. Wicked Lester also performed the song since the band originally recorded the song. The song would not be performed during the 1980s and the 1990s. The band did play the song on Halloween night in 1998 at Dodger Stadium. The band would return the song to the setlist for the Rock the Nation Tour, which was the first time since the 1975 Alive! Tour. It was performed again in the Alive 35 world tour.

Green Island (Ohio)

Green Island is a small island of the U.S. state of Ohio, in Lake Erie. It is located approximately three miles southwest of Put-in-Bay. It is part of Put-in-Bay Township, in Ottawa County.
History.
The U.S. Government bought Green Island in December 1851. A lighthouse was later constructed on the island in 1855. The most famous keeper of the lighthouse was Colonel Charles F. Drake, who lived on the island with his family until the lighthouse burned down on New Year's Eve in 1863. A new, two-story lighthouse was constructed on the island in 1864. It remained active until 1939, when the Coast Guard replaced it with a skeletal tower with an automated light on top. Green Island is currently a wildlife refuge, managed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, and is no longer open to the public.

Soo River

The Soo River is a tributary of the Green River in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in British Columbia, Canada, joining that river just north of the Resort Municipality of Whistler. Approximately 35km in length, its origin is on the south flank of the Pemberton Icefield and its course is generally eastward from there to the Green River valley, although upon reaching that valley it runs north for ~3.5km roughly parallel to the Green before joining it. For much of its course, known as the Soo Valley, it forms a serpentine marshland until reaching a short canyon before entering the valley of the Green River.
Heavily logged over the years, the valley is accessible by rough dirt road. It is a popular cross-country skiing area in winter, partly because its middle reaches are accessible via trails from the Emerald Estates neighbourhood of Whistler. The uppermost part of the Soo Valley features various volcanic formations.
The name "Soo Valley" was used for the skier/hippie group squat at an old lumbering camp-cum-ghost town on Green Lake, famous for a 1970s-vintage group nude photo of its inhabitants, many members of Whistler's established business community today.

Erlebacher's was a high-fashion ladies specialty store that operated in Washington, D.C. The location at 1222 F. Street, NW, opened on October 14, 1907, as G. Erlebacher. The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Gustav Erlbacher were buyers for the Hecht Company in Baltimore before opening the store in Washington. It was described as follows:
Opening - Tomorrow G. Erlebacher throws open the door of his handsome new store. We enter our bid for your favor, giving every assurance that it will be fully earned and eminently appreciated. Our stock consists of exclusive models in women's suits and gowns for afternoon and evening, dainty waists, smart tailor-made skirts, and fine furs. While the styles and goods are exclusive and of the highest class, we have made our prices well within reason, and offer you garments of distinct merit at figures that will be thoroughly appreciated.
In 1914, the store moved to 1210 F. Street, NW. Gustav Erlbacher died in 1924 and Mrs. Erlbacher remarried in 1934 to David Frank. In 1938, the Franks sold the store to Jules Winkelman. In 1949, Erlebacher's opened its store at 1133 Connecticut Avenue, NW, at the corner of Desales Street. The F Street location closed in 1953. The store changed hands in 1970, when Jacob Epstein Katz purchased it from Jules Winkelman. In 1971, Erlebacher's moved to a new location at 5512 Wisconsin Avenue in Friendship Heights, Maryland. Its former location was occupied by Raleigh's. The Friendship Heights location was innovative in that its were occupied by a number of boutique specialty stores including Jandel Furs, Pampillonia Jewelers, and I. Miller shoes. The location was also known as the Holiday Inn Plaza shopping mall.
The store became nationally famous when Jacqueline Bouvier bought much of her trousseau there prior to her marriage to John Fitzgerald Kennedy. In the early 1970s the store garnered widespread publicity by being featured in TIME Magazine for its innovative display, in the front store windows, of the TIME Magazine portraits of famous First Ladies and American women who had previously graced the pages of that magazine. This was the inspired brainstorm of then store owner Jacob E. (Buddy) Katz.

Michigan Nature Association

The Michigan Nature Association is an association in the U.S. state of Michigan which was established in 1952. It is a nonprofit conservation organization dedicated to protecting Michigan's exceptional natural habitats and extraordinary and endangered plants and animals. It has preserved 172 nature sanctuaries in 58 counties throughout Michigan.
History.
It all started with bird watching. Bertha Daubendiek and a few of her friends started an organization for the birds.
In 1951, a bird study group in Macomb County was formed to protect wildlife, hoping to keep Michigan in a natural state. Their first project was protesting the destruction of a tern colony at Metropolitan Beach. This is also when the first name change came about to the St. Clair Metropolitan Beach Sanctuary Association. They started weekend nature exhibits, guided tours, and published a study course. In 1955, the Junior Nature Patrol (JNP), a branch of the St. Clair Metropolitan Beach Sanctuary Association, was formed. In two years, the membership of JNP reached 5,000. But even with all of the educational efforts, the group realized that no wild land was being saved. This is when the organization began its preservation of nature, as we know it today.
The first purchase, made in 1960, was Red Wing Acres in St. Clair County. Soon after, three more properties were purchased. During this time of land acquisitions, the St. Clair Metropolitan Beach Sanctuary Association did not stop in their efforts to protect wildlife. They led a fight for pollution abatement in Mill Creek near Yale and protested drilling in the Port Huron State Game Area, keeping their plates full of environmental issues from every angle. In 1965, they once again changed their name to the Eastern Michigan Nature Association. More properties were purchased, and a gift was given resulting in eight sanctuaries in Northern Michigan, thus leading to the last name change in 1970 to the Michigan Nature Association (MNA). In the same year, MNA started a project in the Keweenaw Peninsula, which is one of MNA's prize sanctuaries known as The Estivant Pines.
By 1971, MNA had grown so large that Bertha Daubendiek, founder of the group in 1951 and executive secretary since 1952, changed her part-time volunteer status to full-time. MNA continued to protect Michigan's wildlife, and in 1974 Bertha received an award as one of Michigan's top ten volunteers by Governor Milliken.
MNA started to see they were on the right track. Endangered species lists for Michigan and the rest of the country were published, revealing that a significant percentage of the species on the list (endangered, threatened, and rare) were already protected in MNA preserves and sanctuaries. 1978 brought about the first show of support by another conservation organization in Michigan, The Detroit Audubon Society, which purchased next to an MNA project in St. Clair County. They later purchased two additional parcels, protecting a total of in this joint effort." Also around this same time, Charles Eshbach published, "From Sawmill to Sanctuary, The Estivant Pines Story," dedicated to MNA's effort to save the pines.
By 1979, MNA had achieved a goal of 50 wholly owned sanctuary-preserves. Also in this year, Bertha Daubendiek was recognized for her work again by the Detroit News as Michiganian of the Year.
The early 80's were abundant in land purchases. MNA added 16 sanctuaries and preserves in just two years. The Michigan Nature Association also experienced a tragedy in this same time period. The Leaning Giant, Michigan's State Champion White Pine and runner up for the National Champion White Pine, in the Estivant Pines was damaged by fire. Later because of this fire damage and gale force winds, the Leaning Giant fell to the ground.
After just five years from the previous goal of 50 sanctuaries, MNA reached another mile marker. The American chestnut project achieved its goal of having every Michigan native tree species on MNA preserves. This was also the 99th project for MNA. These were two great achievements by a small organization.
Over the next few years MNA continued to purchase more land and take more steps against developing the natural habitat. MNA had convinced the Oakland County Road Commission to re-route a road that was proposed to run through one of MNA's Sanctuaries. They had also accumulated more properties now; the count was up to 110 preserves and sanctuaries. Another publication was also underway; Bertha Daubendiek and Edna S. Newnan had been extremely busy over the last year assembling "In Retrospect" a book highlighting the past 28 years of preserving Michigan's wild and rare natural lands. The publication also served as a guide to 26 of MNA's easiest to visit sanctuaries and consists of 221 full-color nature photos taken on MNA lands by 41 Michigan photographers. The proceeds from the sales go to the MNA Endowment fund.
In 1989 another book was printed entitled "Walking Paths in Keweenaw" by Charles Eshbach. Mr. Eshbach reported that during the first two weeks of October there was an average of 1,000 visitors per day at the Estivant Pines.
1990 was a busy time for fundraising around MNA headquarters. MNA received a total of $286,000 for the Estivant Pines. A Memorial Grove was established with contributors who gave $5,000 per acre. The sanctuary was increased to . MNA also ended its four-year search for a spruce grouse sanctuary. MNA was still purchasing other properties in the Keweenaw Peninsula; in 1992, four more sanctuaries were purchased in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
1994 was yet another busy year for MNA. In addition to the preservation and education activities, they published the 7th Edition MNA Nature Sanctuary Guidebook.
The Dauner Martin Nature Sanctuary was added in 1997. This is one of MNA's larger properties consisting of . Other sanctuaries and preserves that were added this same year include: White Cedar Swamps, Baraga Old Growth Forest, Scapaticci, Bullar Lake Fen, Riley Shurte, Sand Creek Prairie, and an addition to Gratiot Lake bringing the count for MNA to nearly 150.
In 2001, Bertha Daubendiek announced her retirement as Executive Secretary. In December of that same year, Jeremy Emmi began work as MNA's new Executive Director.
In 2002, MNA relocated to the city of Williamston, to be more centrally located in the state and be closer to a major university system (MSU).
In 2003, MNA began to develop a strategic vision for the organization, focusing on expanding our acquisition program while adequately maintaining our existing nature sanctuaries and plant preserves around the state. In spring of 2004, we started our new stewardship program with the hiring of Statewide Stewardship Director Sherri Laier. Our stewardship program then encompassed over 150 nature sanctuaries and plant preserves relyaing on the maintenance by our staff and hundreds of volunteer stewards who look after these natural areas with guidance from MNA.
In August 2004, MNA kicked off its Statewide Land Protection Campaign, which was a three-year, three million dollar campaign to protect ten properties in the Lower and Upper Peninsulas. Through 2007, MNA continued to grow, gaining new members and building a top-notch stewardship program.

<doc id="18827986" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18827986" title="Circle of antisimilitude">
Circle of antisimilitude

In geometry, the circle of antisimilitude (also known as mid-circle) of two circles, "α" and "β", is a circle for which "α" and "β" are inverses of each other. If "α" and "β" are non-intersecting or tangent, there exists one circle of antisimilitude; if "α" and "β" intersect at two points, there exist two circles of antisimilitude. When "α" and "β" are congruent, the circle of antisimilitude is degenerate; it becomes a line of symmetry, in which "α" and "β" are reflections of each other.
Properties.
If the two circles "α" and "β" cross each other, another two circles "γ" and "δ" are each tangent to both "α" and "β", and in addition "γ" and "δ" are tangent to each other, then the point of tangency between "γ" and "δ" necessarily lies on one of the two circles of antisimilitude. If "α" and "β" are disjoint and non-concentric, then the locus of points of tangency of "γ" and "δ" again forms two circles, but only one of these is the (unique) circle of antisimilitude. If "α" and "β" are tangent or concentric, then the locus of points of tangency degenerates to a single circle, which again is the circle of antisimilitude.
If the two circles "α" and "β" cross each other, then their two circles of antisimilitude each pass through both crossing points, and bisect the angles formed by the arcs of "α" and "β" as they cross.
If a circle "γ" crosses circles "α" and "β" at equal angles, then "γ" is crossed orthogonally by one of the circles of antisimilitude of "α" and "β"; if "γ" crosses "α" and "β" in supplementary angles, it is crossed orthogonally by the other circle of antisimilitude, and if "γ" is orthogonal to both "α" and "β" then it is also orthogonal to both circles of antisimilitude.
For three circles.
Suppose that, for three circles "α", "β", and "γ", there is a circle of antisimilitude for the pair ("α","β") that crosses a second circle of antisimilitude for the pair ("β","γ"). Then there is a third circle of antisimiltude for the third pair ("α","γ") such that the three circles of antisimilitude cross each other in two triple intersection points. Altogether, at most eight triple crossing points may be generated in this way, for there are two ways of choosing each of the first two circles and two points where the two chosen circles cross. These eight or fewer triple crossing points are the centers of inversions that take all three circles "α", "β", and "γ" to become equal circles. For three circles that are mutually externally tangent, the (unique) circles of antisimilitude for each pair again cross each other at 120° angles in two triple intersection points that are the isodynamic points of the triangle formed by the three points of tangency.

Meager Creek

Meager Creek is a creek in the southern Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in British Columbia, Canada. It flows northeast into the Lillooet River.
It is noted for a large set of surface hot springs, known as the Meager Creek Hot Springs, related to volcanism of the Mount Meager massif on its north side. Public access reopened in the summer of 2008 several years after vandalism of the site and flooding damage to the access road and bridge had seen the site closed. On September 19, 2009, the Capricorn Creek Bridge was once again destroyed by a debris slide. The springs are once again closed to public access. The site (when open) is serviced by Creekside Resources and there is a fee to use the pools. 
Avalanche hazards relating to the combined volcanic and glacial character of the surrounding geography are real and ongoing. The valley of Meager Creek is one of the most active and hazardous in the Canadian Cordillera. Debris flows, mainly from the Mount Meager massif, have filled the valley to a depth of . 
Meager Creek is approximately 95 km (60 mi) northwest of the village of Pemberton.

Pemberton Icefield

The Pemberton Icefield or Pemberton Icecap, is the southernmost of the series of very large icefields studding the Pacific Ranges of the southern Coast Mountains in British Columbia, Canada.
Physical Details.
Approximately in area, the icefield's shape is roughly triangular, with an apex on its northern side, where a short gap separates the ice-mass from that of the smaller Overseer Icefield. Some reckonings include the icemasses of the Overseer massif, in which case the Pemberton Icefield's area may be considered to be ~ larger in area. Overseer Mountain is the highest summit in the region lying in the triangle between the basins of the Lillooet, Squamish-Elaho and Cheakamus-Green valleys, although the highest named summit in the Pemberton Icefield proper is Longspur Peak, on the main icefield's northwest flank above the Ryan River, although a higher, unnamed summit lies in between them, at the northernmost edge of the icefield. Just east of Longspur are Kwtamts Peak and Sisqa Peak (names from St'at'imcets language of Lil'wat people, whose traditional territory includes the eastern reaches and related valleys of the icefield). The southernmost summit of the icefield is Exodus Peak, which lies in the angle between the uppermost reaches of the Squamish River and the valley of the Elaho River, a tributary of the Squamish.
Streams.
Streams having their origin in the icecap include the Squamish River and Soo River on its southern edge, Rutherford Creek of its eastern point, the Ryan River off its northeast side, and tributary streams to the Elaho River, a tributary of the Squamish, on the west, and the south fork of Meager Creek, on its north side, another tributary of the Lillooet. Other smaller icefields nearby are the Ipsoot Glacier (also known as the Ipsoot Icefield) to the east, on the north side of Rutherford Creek, and the Powder Mountain Icefield to the south, beyond the divide separating the headwaters of the Squamish and Soo Rivers.
Popular Use.
Nearby the Resort Municipality of Whistler, the icefield is popular with back-country skiers heli-skiing operations, summer heli-hiking, and onscreen entertainment. Pemberton stands in for Antarctica or the Arctic in films and TV, including the "X-Files" movie and ', "Solitudes" episode, and ' long-running "Stargate" set of series.

The Head Cat

The Head Cat is an American rockabilly supergroup formed by vocalist Lemmy (of Motörhead), drummer Slim Jim Phantom (of The Stray Cats) and guitarist Danny B. Harvey (of Lonesome Spurs and The Rockats).
History.
Head Cat was formed after recording the Elvis Presley tribute album "Swing Cats, A Special Tribute to Elvis" in 2000 to which the future band-mates all contributed. After recordings were finished they stayed at the studio and Lemmy picked up an acoustic guitar and started playing some of his old favorite songs by Johnny Cash, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran. The rest of the guys knew them all and joined in. The name of the band was created by combining the names Motörhead, The Stray Cats and 13 Cats, which resulted in The Head Cat, similar to what Lemmy did in 1980 with Headgirl, a collaboration between Motörhead and Girlschool.
In 2006, the band released their first studio album, "Fool's Paradise", which was a re-release of an earlier album titled "Lemmy, Slim Jim & Danny B". It included cover songs from artists such as Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, Jimmy Reed, T-Bone Walker, Lloyd Price, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. On the recordings Lemmy played acoustic guitar, but on live performances Lemmy uses his signature Rickenbacker bass saying "I'm just not that good on guitar". A year later, a DVD of a live performance was released which was filmed at the Phantom's Cat Club on Los Angeles Sunset Strip and which included 13 live songs and interviews with the band.
The band's second studio album, "Walk the Walk...Talk the Talk", was released by the Niji Entertainment Group in June 2011. This was the first new material by the band in eleven years, following up from the "Lemmy, Slim Jim & Danny B" album in 2000 when the group finalised their official name.

De jure, it is the administrative center of Kalbajar Rayon of Azerbaijan; but the city along with the associated rayon is under the control of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic after it was captured by Armenian forces during the Battle of Kalbajar, near the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War.
Nagorno-Karabakh War.
Armenian and Karabakh forces conquered Kalbajar the Nagorno-Karabakh War, due to its strategic location between the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and Armenia. Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kelbajar offensive Armenian forces "committed several violations of the rules of war, including forced displacement of the civilian population, indiscriminate fire, and the taking of hostages." This capture was condemned by the UN Security Council.
Lakes, rivers, mountains and zones.
There are 13 lakes in local plains and mountains. 
Kalbajar’s longest river is the Tartarchay. Its tributaries are the Tutk­hun, Lev, Zaylik, Alolar, Garaarkhaj (Sar­kar) rivers. 
There are also 20 well-known water springs. 
70-80 per cent of the dist­rict is made up of mountains and each of them has a name. Since motor traffic in mountains is limited, local people have divided the district in different zones:

Purdue Memorial Union

The Purdue Memorial Union (PMU) is a student union building located on the Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA. It opened in 1924 as a memorial to the Purdue students who had fought in World War I. The building includes several restaurants, lounges, and student organization offices, as well as a bowling alley and a hotel.
History.
In the early 1900s, Purdue was in need of a place for students, staff, and visitors to gather in the Purdue community. The Class of 1912 began collecting funds to build a union for Purdue. Funds were collected until the start of World War I. Many men and women from Purdue fought in the war and some died. It was decided that the union should be a memorial dedicated to those men and women. From then on, funds were collected to begin building the PMU.
Building.
The PMU was opened in 1924 before it was completely finished in 1929. In the basement, a bowling alley was built in 1936. The ground floor contains most of the Union’s restaurants and coffee shops. On the main floor of the Union, there are student services as well as some lounges. There are two ballrooms where large groups can gather for special events. Located on this floor as well is the Great Hall of the Union. This is the memorial for Purdue men and women that have fought in the wars. A scale model of Purdue is located in the Great Hall of the Union. The second floor of the PMU contains many lounges and private offices.
Union Club Hotel.
The first part of the Union Club Hotel was built in 1929. Since then, it has grown into a full service hotel providing a place to stay for campus visitors. The hotel is located inside the PMU, and it is next to the Stewart Center which also provides services for visitors. The union’s lost and found is open 24 hours and is located in the Union Club Hotel at the front desk.
All of the hotel rooms have air conditioning, private bathrooms, color televisions, internet and phone access, and various other amenities. There is parking conveniently located across the street in the Grant Street Parking garage. Complimentary shuttle service to the Purdue University Airport and to Indianapolis airport are provided. The hotel also provides handicap accessible accommodations if necessary.
Union Rack & Roll.
The Union Rack & Roll is the bowling alley located in the basement of the PMU. Its hours of operation are Sunday- Thursday from 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 a.m. and Friday- Saturday from 10:00 a.m. – 1:00 a.m. The Union Rack & Roll has music, laser lights, as well as glow in the dark bowling. Besides bowling, there is also an arcade and a pool hall located in the Union Rack and Roll. Reservations are available for birthday parties or other private events.
Services.
The PMU offers a variety of services to students, staff, and visitors as well. There are financial offices, student services, as well as many restaurants.
ATMs are located on the main floor of the union just outside the Cashier Office. The Cashier Office allows students and faculty to cash checks of up to $50. The PEFCU (Purdue Employees Federal Credit Union) is located on the main floor as well. 
The Boiler Copy Maker is a copy center available for students and staff to make copies as well as to buy software. The Card Services office is where students and staff may go to have their Purdue ID card printed. BoilerExpress accounts for Purdue ID cards may also be set up through this office. (BoilerExpress accounts are for students to easily pay for laundry or other items at campus minimarts. Money is loaded onto the student’s Purdue ID.) There is a UPS Store located in the PMU that offers full service packaging and receiving, and various other mail services. The Purdue Shop in the union is one of the many places on campus to purchase Purdue apparel.
The PMU offers many dining options. There are cafés to grab a quick lunch, restaurants to have a full meal in, and places to get a hot or cold drink. Flatbreads and Oasis Café offer deli sandwiches. Urban Market is a convenience store with lots of organic foods as well as a cereal bar. Lemongrass offers soups and other Thai and Vietnamese foods. The Sagamore Room is a more fancy restaurant that has breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus. Villa Fresh Italian Kitchen has a variety of pizzas and salads as well as other Italian foods. Pappy’s Sweet Shop offers hamburgers, hotdogs, and many types of ice cream for dessert. Zia Juice has fresh squeezed juices as well as smoothies. Starbucks has a variety of hot or cold drinks as well as baked treats.
Purdue Student Union Board.
The Purdue Student Union Board (PSUB) is a student organization that provides programs and services for students, staff, and the community of West Lafayette. PSUB was an organization before the union was built and it helped fund the building. In 1920 when the organization started it had only a few members, but it now has over a hundred. Students may join PSUB at no cost and there are different positions students can choose to be involved in. Students in this organization plan fun events and activities for the Purdue community.

Western Australian state election, 1974

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 30 March 1974 to elect all 51 members to the Legislative Assembly and 15 members to the 30-seat Legislative Council. The one-term Labor government, led by Premier John Tonkin, was defeated by the Liberal Party, led by Opposition Leader Charles Court.
Overview.
The Liberal Party won the election after a campaign focused mostly on inflation, industrial unrest, states' rights and education. The outgoing Tonkin government had had a turbulent ride in its three years of office, having only a one-seat majority in the Assembly and being outnumbered two-to-one in the Council.
The 15-month-old Whitlam Labor federal government had proven unpopular in Western Australia which saw it as taking a centralist view towards federal-state affairs, and Whitlam himself was hit by a soft drink can and a tomato whilst addressing voters at Forrest Place during the campaign. The Country Party had tentatively merged with the Democratic Labor Party in the period preceding the election, going to the voters as the National Alliance which put forward a centrist platform—however, they lost both votes and seats as compared to the 1971 election in doing so. Arthur Bickerton, the member for Pilbara, became the first Minister to be defeated at an election since 1939.
In order to form a parliamentary majority, the National Country Party under its new leader, Ray McPharlin, agreed to form a coalition with the Liberals after the election, and negotiated three seats in the Ministry.
Results.
Legislative Assembly.

10.5 cm Cannon Model 1927

The 10.5 cm Cannon Model 1927 was a heavy field gun used by the Netherlands and Hungary during World War II. Dutch guns were known as the 10-veld. Hungary purchased a license and built them as the 31 M. Captured weapons were designated by the Wehrmacht as the schwere 10.5 cm Kanone 335(h). Four were bought by the Swedish coastal artillery as the 10.5 cm kanon m/27. They were later upgraded to m/34 standard as the m/27-34. They were transferred to the field artillery in 1942. The Dutch appear to have bought guns with both 40 and 42 caliber barrel lengths.
The gun was designed for motor traction with spoked steel wheels with rubber rims. The spades were removed and placed onto the trail legs for transport.

Roman Catholic Diocese of Daet

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Daet () is a diocese located in the city of Daet in the Ecclesiastical province of Caceres in the Philippines.
Diocese of Daet.
The Diocese of Daet, with jurisdiction over the Province of Camarines Norte and suffragan to the Archdiocese of Caceres, was created on May 27, 1974 by Pope Paul VI. Most Rev. Celestino R. Enverga, D.D. as the first bishop of the Diocese. The current and 3rd Bishop of Daet is Most Rev. Gilbert A. Garcera, D.D.
History.
On September 1, 1974, the Diocese of Daet was formally established along with the installation of its first bishop, Most Rev. Celestino Rojo Enverga, a native of Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte. The Diocese of Daet was entrusted to the care of St. Joseph the Worker. 
Through the Apostolic Constitution “Requirit Maximopere,” Pope Paul VI separated Daet from the Archdiocese of Caceres, thereby creating Daet as a new Diocese which became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Caceres.
Since the Augustinian missionaries Frays Diego de Espinar and Francisco Merino had established Christian communities in Paracale in 1571, it took 393 years for Camarines Norte, the land of gold and pineapple, to be erected as a diocese.
Ordained in 1706, Don Gregorio Cabalquinto from the town of Paracale was the first Bicolano priest.
The history of the diocese could be divided into three periods. The first period spans from 1974-1984.
According to Bishop Celestino Enverga, two years after the canonical erection in 1974, there was a diocesan house complex, a charity clinic, and a haven for homeless people discharged from hospitals. After four years the Most Holy trinity Cathedral was set up. There was a public library; a diocesan museum, a printing press, and statues,
The first decade of the diocese had given birth to three parishes: the Parish of St. Roch, Batobalani in May 31, 1976; the Parish of San Lorenzo Ruiz in July 2, 1983; and the Parish of St. Nicholas of Tolentino, Colasi in July 23, 1983.
The first decade was characterized by construction of structures: the first phase of the Diocesan House was completed in 1977 and the Holy Trinity Cathedral was ready for its dedication by September 1, 1984.
The second period runs from 1985-1994, starting with the foundation by Bishop Enverga of the Religious Order of Kolbean Sisters.
On October 16, 1990, the Diocese of Daet became a vacant see (sede vacante) because of death of Bishop Enverga. Bishop Almoneda, then the Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Daet, became the Diocesan Administrator, and on July 6, 1991 he became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Daet.
Bishop Celestino Enverga died in 1990 and Bishop Benjamin J. Almoneda was appointed as the second bishop of Daet in 1991
The nine barangays from the Diocese of Gumaca were annexed to the Parish of Sta. Elena; the Parish of the Most Holy Trinity was established in 1991, the Vision-Mission Statement of the diocese was formulated in 1991; the Holy Trinity Preparatory Seminary, the first seminary in the diocese, was opened in 1992, the first Diocesan Pastoral Assembly was held in 1992; the Bishop Enverga and the Carillon Halls were inaugurated in 1993; and the Second General Pastoral Assembly was convened in 1994.
Bishop Almoneda prioritized catechesis among his pastoral program. Three years after he took office, the Mater Vitae Catechetical Center was inaugurated in 1994.
In the second decade of the diocese the focus shifted from structures to evangelization, reaching its apex in the First Diocesan Synod of Daet.
In the decade from 1995 to 2004 the First Diocesan Synod of Daet was held.
New parishes were set up: the Parishes of St. James the Great of Calabaca, Capalonga, Our Lady of Good Voyage of Calaguas, St. Philip of San Felipe of Basud, Holy Family of Talobatib, Our Lady of All Nations of Tabugon, the Chaplaincy of St. Roch of Tabas, the Quasi Parish of the Divine Mercy and the Parish of San Lorenzo, the Deacon. SPACFI was inaugurated in this period.
To accommodate the increasing number of priestly vocations, in 1997 Bishop Benjamin Almoneda started the Holy Trinity College Seminary project; construction of the seminary compound started in 1999, and took about six years.
Bishop Nestor Carino was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Daet in 2003.
After parish consultations from 2001-2002, the Synodal sessions were held from 2002-2003. The decrees of the synod were promulgated in January 2004, a common pastoral direction of the diocese was defined, and the pastoral program for the next five years defined.
From fourteen parishes and three vicariates in 1974 the diocese grew to 24 canonically erected parishes, 5 quasi-parishes plus one chaplaincy and five vicariates, with concomitant personnel increases.
On December 2004 the Pearl Jubille Celebration started by launching the MSK in Labo; on April 11, 2005, on the occasion of the 75th Birth Anniversary of Bishop Almoneda, the Our Lady of Gudalupe Chapel was dedicated; in May 2005 the diocesan catechetical Day was celebrated; on May 28, the Pearl Jubilee Santacruzan was held.
Vision statement.

Lancaster Green Ayre railway station

Lancaster Green Ayre railway station was the Midland Railway's station in the city of Lancaster in England. The line between Green Ayre and Morecambe was used for pioneering experimental electrification via overhead wires.
The station closed to passengers in 1966 and there are no remains.
History.
Lancaster's first two stations were the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway's at "Greaves" in 1840, and the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway's "Lancaster Castle" which superseded it in 1846.
The third station was opened by the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company (MH&R) on 12 June 1848. The station building was designed by Edmund Sharpe. Originally called "Lancaster", it was soon renamed "Lancaster Green Ayre", although timetables incorrectly listed its name as Lancaster Green Area until 1870. The line originally ran from Lancaster to . The MH&R soon amalgamated with the "little" North Western Railway, which continued the line eastward from 17 November 1849, reaching in 1850. A connecting curve between Green Ayre and Castle opened on 18 December 1849.
The station was on the southern bank of the River Lune, adjacent to Skerton Bridge and immediately to the north of the city centre. Immediately west of the station was the junction between the connecting curve to Castle and Green Ayre's engine shed and the main line, which then crossed the river via "Greyhound Bridge" and continued along the north bank of the river, passing under the Lancaster and Carlisle's "Carlisle Bridge" over the river. East of Green Ayre the line followed the south bank of the river.
Take-over by the Midland Railway.
The "little" North Western Railway was taken over in 1874 by the Midland Railway, which had previously operated, then leased the line, and became a significant route for that company, giving access from its Yorkshire lines to the Lancashire coast in an area dominated by its major rival, the London and North Western Railway.
The Lancaster–Morecambe line was electrified in 1908. This was the first high-voltage overhead electrification in the United Kingdom and was at 6,600 volts AC 25Hz; it was the pioneer for such systems. It was intended to be a test bed for further mainline electrification by the Midland Railway. In 1952 the original rolling stock was life expired and was withdrawn. Steam traction took over for a short while and then the power supply was upgraded to 50Hz and some new stock provided; this was to act as a test-bed for further main-line electrification in the UK. This section of line became particularly busy.
Run down.
The line between and Morecambe via Green Ayre fell victim to the Beeching Axe. It closed to passengers on 2 January 1966, although the line through the station continued to be used for freight until 16 March 1976. The station was demolished that year.
The Greyhound Bridge was converted for use by the A589 road from 1972. The site of Green Ayre station is now a public park. Nothing remains of the station, but a goods crane from goods shed has been erected in the park near the site. The site of the adjacent locomotive shed is now occupied by a supermarket.

Wyna River

The Wyna River is a river located mostly in Canton Aargau, but also Canton Lucerne, Switzerland. It is a tributary of the Suhre River. The Wynental is the Wyna River valley.
River.
The Wyna River is 32 km long. It begins north of Neudorf, just west of the small hamlet of Underdorf. At this point, the "Lochbach" (or Gap Creek, which starts in the Chegelwald, west of Neudorf) is joined by various intermittent streams arising all around Neudorf. The Wyna runs north between Beromünster and Menziken before connecting with the Suhre River just north of Suhr. Tributaries that feed the Wyna include the Moosbach (left, north of Beromünster), Schwarzenbach (right, at south Menziken), Rickenbach (left, at south Menziken), and Dorfbach (left, at Zetzwil). The Wyna River is also referred to as the Wina or Wyne River.
Valley.
The valley is fairly narrow, with an average width of about 500 meters. Steep hills rise on both sides, carved by tributary valleys. Municipalities found in the Wynental from beginning to end of the Wyna are: Neudorf, Beromünster, Burg/Menziken, Pfeffikon, Reinach, Leimbach, Zetzwil, Gontenschwil, Oberkulm/Unterkulm, Teufenthal, Gränichen, and Suhr. The Wynental is also referred to as the Wynetal or Wynatal. The general region is also referred to as "Stumpenland" due to the cigar industry that once centered in Menziken.
Glacial genesis.
The upper portions of the valley was carved by the Reuss glacier. Large moraine deposits remain at Zetzwil and Gontenschwil. The surrounding hills are largely molasse.
Transportation.
Connecting road 23 runs along the Wyna for the majority of the valley's length from Beromünster to Suhr. This road is referred to variously as Aargauerstrasse, Hauptstrasse, Aarauerstrasse, Wynentalstrasse, and numerous names north of Teufenthal and is a popular cycling route. The WSB (Wynental und Suhrental Bahn), a narrow gauge railroad, serves the Wynental. The Wynental branch of the WSB runs from Aarau to Menziken.

Christine Girard

Christine Girard (born January 3, 1985 in Elliot Lake, Ontario) is a Canadian weightlifter from White Rock, British Columbia. She competes in the 63 kg division. Girard was the first Canadian female to win a medal in weightlifting when she won bronze at the 2012 London Olympics. She is also the reigning Commonwealth Games and Pan American Games champion in her weight class and has won multiple medals in each of those competitions. She holds the Commonwealth games record and the Pan-American Games record in the Clean and Jerk.
Career.
Weightlifting became a passion for Girard and her three sisters when they moved to Quebec. She began training early and entered her first provincial competition when she was 12. Girard became a member of the national team in 2001 at the age of 16 when she competed in Greece. In 2002, she won a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games which she improved upon in 2006 with a silver. At the 2006 University World Championships she won the bronze medal. She next won a silver at the 2007 Pan American Games. Girard then finished 8th at the 2007 World Weightlifting Championships with a total of 221 kg. Girard then entered the 2008 Summer Olympics, she improved upon this by finishing fourth, with a total of 228 kg and 3 kg away from a medal. 
Girard built upon these achievements by finally winning a crown as champion when she won the gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and completed her Commonwealth Games medal collection. En route to winning her gold Girard set a Commonwealth Games record in the snatch at 105 kg, in the clean and jerk she added an additional 130 kg for a total of 235 kg which were also Commonwealth records. Girard next conquered the 2011 Pan American Games when she won the gold in her weight class in Gaudalajara.
At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Girard participated in the women's 63 kg. She finished fourth in the snatch portion, then second in the clean and jerk, lifting 133 kg. Her total of 236 kg won her the bronze medal.
She is the first Canadian woman, and third Canadian overall, to win a medal in weightlifting. Girard said that winning the Olympic medal was one of her top two best moments in life, "It is very hard to describe how I feel. Four years ago in Beijing I came fourth, and since then I have spent the past four years training through injuries and various changes in my life to get to this moment. All I have been thinking about is getting on the podium. Now I have reached it. It feels good. I should say my wedding comes close, but this is completely different.’’
Coaching.
Girard began coaching other athletes in Weightlifting after her move to BC while she was preparing for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Upon her return from the Olympic Games, Girard began coaching in a greater capacity. She started her own weightlifting club - the Kilophile Weightlifting Club - and offers coaching services to other fitness centres notably in Crossfit Gyms.
Personal.
Girard was born in Elliot Lake, Ontario but moved with her family to Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec in 1992 when she was 7. She then moved to British Columbia in January 2010. Weightlifting was a family affair for Girard and her family continues to hold provincial and local roles for the sport in Quebec.

Fred Swearingen

Fred Swearingen, of Athens, Ohio, where for many years he owned and operated Swearingen's Sporting Goods, is a former official in the National Football League, serving as both a referee and field judge from 1960 through 1980. He wore number 21 for the major part of his career. He is best remembered for two particular calls during Pittsburgh Steelers games.
The Immaculate Reception.
On December 23, 1972, Swearingen was the Referee for an AFC Divisional Playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium. Following a scoreless first half, Roy Gerela kicked two field goals for a 6–0 Steeler lead. But late in the 4th quarter, Raider backup quarterback Ken Stabler (replacing a flu-ridden, ineffective Daryle Lamonica) scampered 30 yards for a touchdown to give Oakland a 7–6 lead with time running out.
Then with 22 seconds remaining, Pittsburgh was on its 40-yard line on 4th and 10. Terry Bradshaw scrambled under Raider pressure, looking for receiver Barry Pearson before spotting John "Frenchy" Fuqua. But at the Raider 35-yard line, safety Jack Tatum collided with Fuqua, sending the ball wobbling backward where rookie running back Franco Harris scooped up the ball, running untouched into the end zone. Under the rules of that time, there could not be a legal catch if the ball touched two offensive players in succession. If the ball either bounced off both Tatum and Fuqua, or hit only Tatum, the catch would be legal. Swearingen consulted with umpire Pat Harder and field judge Adrian Burk, but then went to a sideline phone to consult with NFL supervisor of officials Art McNally, who was in the press box. Swearingen emerged and made his ruling that the play was a touchdown, in the process angering the Raiders. The Steelers won 13–7, and the win led to the beginning of that team's great success of the 1970s.
Super Bowl XIII.
In Super Bowl XIII between the Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys on January 21, 1979 at the Orange Bowl, Swearingen (by now a field judge) found himself in the middle of another controversial call. Midway through the 4th quarter, the Steelers held to a slim 21–17 lead when Bradshaw dropped back to pass from their 44 yard line. He launched a deep pass to wideout Lynn Swann, who was closely covered by cornerback Benny Barnes. The two stumbled over each other, and another official, back judge Pat Knight ruled it an incompletion. Swearingen overruled the official and ruled pass interference on Barnes. Several Cowboys argued that the call should have been either interference on Swann or incidental contact (which would mean no penalty should have been called). The call stood, and later in the drive Franco Harris ran 22 yards for a touchdown (a play on which Cowboys safety Charlie Waters was in position to make the tackle before he collided with umpire Art Demmas) and a 28–17 lead. A late Cowboy rally resulted in the final score being a 35–31 Steeler win. Later, the NFL ruled Swearingen was in error with his interference call.

Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 20 February 1971 to elect all 51 members to the Legislative Assembly and 15 members to the 30-seat Legislative Council. The four-term Liberal-Country Party coalition government, led by Premier David Brand, was defeated by the Labor Party, led by Opposition Leader John Tonkin.
This was the first election in which no seats were uncontested since the introduction of responsible government in 1890. This was partly due to the Democratic Labor Party deciding to contest every seat up for election in both Houses.

List of Bryan Adams backing band members

The backing band, also referred to as The Dudes of Leisure or simply the Bryan Adams' backing band, is the informal name given to the group of musicians who accompany Canadian rock musician Bryan Adams both in the studio and at live shows. Unlike many solo musicians, Adams does not use a rotation of session musicians, preferring to use the same musicians for all his studio and live work.
History.
Although Adams' solo career started in 1979, a constant backing band did not materialise immediately. It was not until work began on Adams' second album, "You Want It You Got It" that the band began to crystallize. Working alongside Adams on many of the tracks for this album were Hall & Oates drummer Mickey Curry and keyboardist Tommy Mandel, both of whom would go on to become regular members of the group.
Adams' 1983 album, "Cuts Like A Knife" saw the addition of bassist Dave Taylor and guitarist Keith Scott, who had worked with Adams in the past. With Taylor and Scott added to the line-up, the band had now assumed the form that it would keep for the next 15 years. Drummer Pat Steward also performed some drumming duties with the band, most notably on Adams' hit "Summer of '69" and at Live Aid in 1985. However, Steward did not stay with the band beyond the mid 1980s.
In 1998, Mandel and Taylor left the band and Adams, Scott and Curry toured as a three piece band with Adams playing bass and Scott performing both the rhythm and lead guitar parts. This arrangement continued until 2002, when Adams decided to revert to the five piece format and enlisted the services of bassist Norm Fisher and keyboardist Gary Breit. This is the line-up the band retains to this day.

Meaghan Benfeito

Meaghan Benfeito (born March 2, 1989) is a Canadian diver. She competes in the 10m synchronized event with Roseline Filion. Benfeito and Filion won a bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London in the 10 m platform synchro event. She has also won three other bronze medals over her career with one each in synchro events at the world championships, Commonwealth Games, and Pan American Games.
Career.
She began diving for Canada in 2005 and credits Emilie Heymans and Alexander Despatie for inspiring her to take up the sport. She won a bronze medal at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in her hometown of Montreal, but she and Filion have been unable to return to the medal podium at the Worlds since. In 2006, they won a bronze at the Commonwealth Games. Benfeito won a bronze medal at the 2007 Pan American Games in the 3m Synchronized event with Kelly MacDonald.
Benfeito and Filion qualified for the Beijing Olympics after they beat teammates Heymans and Marie-Eve Marleau which was considered a dramatic upset, particularly at defeating Canadian diving legend Heymans. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, the diving partners finished in 7th place. She did not compete in the 2010 Commonwealth Games due to a lingering shoulder injury that had not healed in time.
Both the ladies failed to medal at any events leading into the 2012 London Olympics. At the 2012 edition the two Canadians managed to hold third place through nearly the whole competition in the 10 m platform synchro event. After the medal clinching dive she said that "We gave it all we had and we came away with a bronze medal. We're pretty happy with that." A Quebec politician from a provincially sovereigntist party, the Parti Québécois, commented on the medals won by Benfeito and others as the first four medals won were from Quebec athletes. Pauline Marois said that "“This means, among other things, that it’s another example of how Quebec could shine among the brightest ... as an independent country. We could continue to win our medals, I’m sure of that." Benfeito responded to a similar question from Canadian media when asked if she was as proud of the day as all the day's medalists were from Quebec athletes by saying that "No, we are one big happy gang. We are equally as proud of our home in Quebec as we are of our home in Canada."
Personal.
Together with her diving partner of seven years in Filion, they consider each other lifelong friends. Filion said of their relationship that "We've known one another for our entire lives, so we have a really good relationship. It's more of a sisterhood relationship now. We could probably go to a restaurant and order for each other."

Proposals for the redevelopment of the rest of the former Queens Hall site have been ongoing since the 1990s with failed proposals including those from 1995 for an office building designed by Norman Foster for Royal London Insurance and a latter proposal in 2004 for two skyscrapers to be named Criterion Place designed by Ian Simpson Architects to be developed by Simons Estates. Neither of these proposals went to fruition but there are plans to complete the redevelopment of the former Queens Hall site in the near future. The Leeds Arena due for opening in 2013 will become the new main concert venue in Leeds.

National Occupational Research Agenda

The National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) is a partnership program developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The program was founded in 1996 to provide a framework for research collaborations among universities, large and small businesses, professional societies, government agencies, and worker organizations. Together these parties identify issues in the field of workplace safety and health that require immediate attention based on the number of workers affected, the seriousness of the hazard, and the likelihood that new safety information and approaches can effect a change.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is a U.S. federal government agency with a mandate to study workplace safety and health. NIOSH and its partners develop and integrate research to prevent occupational injuries and illnesses for over 150 million U.S. workers.
Developing the first research agenda.
Dr. Linda Rosenstock was appointed director of NIOSH in 1994. At that time many saw the Institute as an agency that yielded strong scientific research, but needed stronger connections to the real-world workforce. To remedy this, Rosenstock sought to develop stronger relationships with other organizations and agencies. NIOSH moved its headquarters from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., where the Institute could enjoy closer contact with labor and industry representatives. NIOSH's effort to build partnerships inside and outside of the government culminated in the development of the National Occupational Research Agenda. 
To form the agenda, NIOSH leaders petitioned stakeholders in industry, labor, and health care for input. Organizations including General Motors, IBM, Mobil, the United Auto Workers, and the American Public Health Association joined NIOSH in developing the agenda. NIOSH sought additional aid through a series of public town meetings held in Chicago, Seattle, and Boston. In total, nearly 500 organizations and individuals provided the input that resulted in the research agenda.
NORA in practice.
NIOSH announced NORA's 21 priority research areas in 1996. On the strength of industry support and bipartisan backing, Congress increased funding for NIOSH and investment in NORA grew from $15.4 million in 1996 to $72.3 million in 1999. Following Rosenstock's resignation in 2000, Dr. John Howard continued to press and expand the NORA approach as NIOSH's new director. Since 1996, NORA's projects have covered topics such as slip, trip, and fall (STF) injuries; green tobacco sickness; extended work hours; latex allergies; vehicle and mobile equipment-related injury; silica, lung cancer, and respiratory disease; and biomechanical stress in drywall installation.
Since 2006, the program has been organized by industrial sector as defined in the North American Industry Classification System. NORA sector councils, which head the research for the sectors, help to implement the national research agenda. 
The current NORA sectors are as follows:
NORA priorities.
To aid with goal-setting, NORA uses specific guidelines to determine which research needs are priorities. These guidelines are as follows:
NORA symposiums.
To ensure a continued focus on the practical application of the research, NIOSH cosponsored NORA Symposiums in 1999, 2003, 2006, and 2008. The 2008 NORA Symposium—"Public Market for Ideas and Partnerships"—was the first not held in the Washington, D.C., area. Instead it was hosted in Denver, reflecting NIOSH's desire to expand occupational research collaborations in the Western United States.

<doc id="18828784" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18828784" title="Life of Samuel Johnson (1787)">
Life of Samuel Johnson (1787)

The Life of Samuel Johnson or "Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D." was written by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full biography of Samuel Johnson with Thomas Tyers's "A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson" being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins was a friend of Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did not like him. After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his works. His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's "Life of Samuel Johnson" came under swift attack from critics, from friends of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances.
Background.
Sir John Hawkins, according to Bertram Davis, is "the author of the first full-length biograph of Samuel Johnson" but that "many remember him as the man Johnson once described as 'unclubable'." Although "unclubable" reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: "As we were returning from the meadows that day, I remember we met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson seemed much rejoiced to see; and no wonder, for I have often heard him speak of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship" Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with "The Gentleman's Magazine". Later, Hawkins was, in 1749, a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.
After joining the Ivy Lane club, he married Sidney Storer, heir to a 20,000 pound fortune with Hawkins receiving an addition 10,000 pound dowry, in 1753 and his career started to quickly pick up: he bought a home on the Thames at Twickenham near Horace Walpole; he published Izaak Walton's "The Compleat Angler" in 1760; he was appointed as a magistrate in 1761; in 1765 became Chairman of the Quarter Sessions for the County of Middlesex; and wrote a "A General History of the Science and Practice of Music"in 1776. He was knighted in 1772, and served as Chairman of the Quarter Session.
Even with all the success, or because of it, he was resented among some of Johnson's circle. Hawkins, member of Johnson's second club, the Literary Club established 1764, resigned over a dispute with others of Johnson's circle. The relationship between Hawkins and the rest of Johnson's friends became so tense that many criticized Johnson for choosing Hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will. However, within hours of Johnson's death, Thomas Cadell and William Strahan asked Hawkins to write a biography and an edition of Johnson's literary works.
On 16 December 1784, "St. James's Chronicle" stated Hawkins and Boswell were both writing biographies. However, Thomas Tyers published before them when his "A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson", the first postmortem biographical work on Johnson but not a full length biography, ran in the December 1784 issue of the "The Gentleman's Magazine". This did not deter Hawkins and by 21 December 1784, he began advertising his "authentick" life of Johnson. This provoked an anonymous articles in "St. James's Chronicle" started attacking Hawkins: "It is evident from the Conduct of the late Dr. Johnson, that he designed Mr. Boswell for the sole Writer of his Life. Why else did he furnish him with such Materials for it as were withheld from every other Friend ... Little indeed did he suppose that a Person whom he had made one of his Executors would have instantly claimed the Office of his Biographer. Still less could he have imagined that this Self-Appointment would have been precipitately confirmed by the Booksellers." 
The source of the attack was George Steevens, who worked with Johnson on an edition of Shakespeare's plays and was a constant critic of Hawkins. He, along with others, began to spread rumors about Hawkins: some claimed that he stole Johnson's belongings after his death, and others claimed that Hawkins wanted to slander Johnson in his biography. Hawkins house burned down on 23 February 1785, and he was barely able to preserve his notes and Johnson's diaries, which were the foundations for his "Life". The work was published in March 1787. St. James's Chronicle and London Chronicle published excerpts for "several weeks" with the "Universal Magazine" and the "Political Magazine" following later. A second edition was published mid-April 1787.
Biography.
The biography is a standard biography describing incidents of Johnson's life. One of the unique features that made Hawkins's "Life" special was its ability to provide information on Johnson's contributions to "The Gentleman's Magazine". The biography revealed details about the events surrounding the early years of the magazine and events that happened between employees, which provided insights into the literary magazine not published before.
Boswell was unable to publish his "Life" until 1791, but when he did he introduced his work with a summary of what he felt Hawkins's biography contained:
Since my work was announced, several Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnson have been published, the most voluminous of which is one compiled for the booksellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. Johnson, I never saw in his company, I think but once, and I am sure not above twice. Johnson might have esteemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary history; but from the rigid formalities of his manners, it is evident that they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson's character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left; of which, before delivering them up to the residuary legatee, whose property they were, he endeavoured to extract the substance. In this he has not been very successful, as I have found upon a perusal of those papers, which have been since transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I must acknowledge, exhibit a "farrago", of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossipping; but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works, (even one of several leaves from Osborne's Harleian Catalogue, and those not compiled by Johnson, but by Oldys,) a very small part of it relates to the person who is the subject of the book; and, in that, there is such an inaccuracy in the statement of facts, as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable, and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory. But what is still worse, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast, by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend; who, I trust, will, be a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious misrepresentation of this authour, and from the slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him."
Hawkins and Hester Thrale, in Boswell's mind, were rivals to "what he considered his domain". That is not to say that he was wrong about Hawkins's "Life" because it does contain many digressions, such as a discussion of sixteenth century breakfast habits written in Latin and a discussion on the history of taverns among others. Hawkins also included long extracts from Johnson's works.
Critical response.
The "Monthly Review", the "Critical Review", the "English Review", and the "European Magazine" contained reviews that, in the words of Bertram Davis, characterized the biography as "a malevolent and spiteful account of Johnson's life, grossly inaccurate, and rendered utterly ridiculous by its pompous legalisms and its digressions on every conceivable subject. The book, if they were to be believed, was less a biography than a polemic, less a work of art than a collection of senile gossip." In particular, the "Critical Review" said, "we often lose Dr. Johnson... The knight sinks under the weight of his subject, and is glad to escape to scenes more congenial to his disposition, and more suitable to his talents, the garrulity of a literary old man." 
Arthur Murphy anonymously wrote in the "Monthly Review": "Sir John most probably acquired his notions of language at his master's desk: he admired the phraseology of deeds and parchments, whereof, to speak in his own manner, he read so much, that in consequence thereof, he has been chiefly conversant therein and by the help of the parchments aforesaid, missed the elegance above mentioned, and uses works, that in them we sometimes meet with, and being bred and attorney, he caught the language of the said trade, whereof he retains so much, that he is now rendered an incompetent critic thereby, and in consequence thereof." Steevens, under the name "Philo Johnson" claimed in the "European Magazine": "the great solid principle that secures its condemnation, is the spirit of malevolence to the dead, which breathes all through it. Sir John Hawkins, with all the humanity and very little of the dexterity of a Clare-Market butcher, has raised his blunt axe to deface the image of his friend."
A later review in the "St Jame's Chronicle" joked: "it was false 'that Mrs. Hobart had an intention of reading Sir John Hawkins' book. The late hours at which people of rank go to bed, renders it wholly unnecessary to force a sleep in public places." This followed with a joke in a later journal: a "gentleman, lately arrived in town, has been for several days past afflicted with a lethargy, owing to the perusal of three chapters in Hawkins's Life of Johnson." A third stated: the branches of willow trees planted in Lichfield "should be lopped off, and tied in bundles, ... and properly applied to the naked backs of his various biographers, taking care, that the largest bundle be appropriated unto the use and behoof of Sir John Hawkins, Knight."

Lawrence Lewis (1767–1839)

Lawrence Lewis (April 4, 1767 – November 20, 1839) was a nephew of George Washington who married Nelly Custis, a granddaughter of Martha Washington.
Life.
He was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia in 1767 to Fielding Lewis and Betty Washington Lewis, the sister of George Washington. He volunteered for service in 1794 to help suppress the Whiskey Rebellion and served as aide-de-camp to General Daniel Morgan, achieving the rank of major.
Washington, after finishing his tenure as president, called on several of his nephews to assist him at his Mount Vernon plantation. On August 4, 1797, he wrote to Lewis inviting him to serve as his personal secretary.
While at Mount Vernon, Lewis came to know Eleanor "Nelly" Parke Custis, the granddaughter of Martha Dandridge Custis Washington and Daniel Parke Custis. She and her brother, George Washington Parke Custis, had been informally adopted by George and Martha Washington after the 1781 death of their father, John Parke Custis. At Mount Vernon she acted as the social director, entertaining the many visitors to the former president.
Woodlawn.
Lewis and Nelly Custis were married at Mount Vernon on February 22, 1799,
and resided there for the first several years of their marriage. Their first child, Frances Parke Lewis, was born there on November 27, 1799. 
After George Washington's death on December 14, 1799, Lewis served as the primary executor of his will. As a wedding gift from the Washingtons, the couple had received of the Mount Vernon plantation. From 1800 to 1805, Lewis oversaw the construction of the Woodlawn Plantation, designed by the physician-architect William Thornton.
Lewis and his wife lived at Woodlawn until about 1830, when they settled at the new Audley estate in what is now Clarke County, Virginia. Lewis had purchased the tract of from George Washington's extensive real estate holdings. He died in 1839 in Arlington, Virginia and was buried in the vault at Mount Vernon, close to the sarcophagi of George and Martha Washington.
Family.
The Lewises had eight children, four of whom lived past infancy:

Henry Kulky

Henry Kulky (August 11, 1911 – February 12, 1965) was an American actor and former professional wrestler from Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, probably best remembered as Chief Petty Officer Curly Jones from season 1 of "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea".
Career.
Born Henry Kulkovich, Kulky began boxing in his teenage years. After six bouts, he stopped boxing when he was offered a position training wrestlers at St. Matthew's Lyceum in his native Hastings-on Hudson.
Stanislaus Zbyszko convinced Kulky to compete professionally in 1939. Moving to Argentina, Kulky competed throughout South America under the ring name Bomber Kulkavich. The number of matches in which he competed is uncertain; one claim states that he won 172 of 175 matches. Kulky, however, claims that he won nearly all of 7,000 matches. While in South America, he is also said to have won the continent's judo crown.
Like most wrestlers who turned to acting in the 1950s he owed his big break to Mike Mazurki. The two appeared in several parts in the 1940s and 1950s, with Mazurki's agent getting him a part in "Call Northside 777".
Because of his rather tough guy image, Kulky became typecast as military men, thugs, gangsters, bartenders, wrestlers and other "strong guys" who were at times quite friendly and lovable characters contrasting strongly with the tough guy image. In 1949, he began playing Otto Schmindlap in the television series, "The Life of Riley". In the series, Kulky portrayed a co-worker of series character Chester Riley, a wing riveter at an aircraft plant. From 1959 to 1962, Kulky was cast in the recurring role as Chief Max Bronsky in forty-six episodes of Jackie Cooper's CBS military sitcom/drama television series, "Hennesey". The role was close to Kulky's heart because during World War II, he was a Boatswain's mate in the United States Navy.
Death.
Kulky's last role was as Curley Jones in the television series "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea". He died in Oceanside, California, of a heart attack in 1965 while he was studying a script.

Seamus Lynch

Seamus Lynch (born 1945) is a former Irish republican and socialist politician.
Born in North Belfast, Lynch became a republican activist around the start of The Troubles, and sided with the Official wing of Sinn Féin in the split of 1970. He was imprisoned from October 1971 until the following year. He was a strong supporter of the Official IRA's ceasefire in 1972 and Official Sinn Féin's vocal socialism. As a result, he became active in the Republican Clubs movement, and stood for the organisation in Belfast North at the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973. He received only 1.7% of the first preference votes cast and was not elected. He stood again for the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention, but his vote dropped to just 1.3%. He was elected to Belfast City Council in 1977, representing the G district, but lost his seat in 1981.
Lynch next stood in the Westminster seat of Belfast North at the 1979 general election, increasing his vote to 4.5%, the best result for Republican Clubs in Northern Ireland, and at the Northern Ireland Assembly election, 1982, he increased his share to 7.1%.
Workers' Party.
In 1982, Republican Clubs was renamed the Workers' Party of Ireland and Lynch became its Northern Chairman and national Vice-President He then stood in the 1983 general election, receiving 5.7% of the vote, but did less well in the Northern Ireland-wide European Parliament election in 1984, taking only 1.3% and seventh position of eight candidates. He was re-elected to Belfast City Council in 1985, representing Oldpark, and held his seat in 1989.
Lynch's best result in a Westminster election came when he took 11.8% of the vote in a three-way contest in the Belfast North by-election, 1986. At the following year's general election, he dropped back to 8.3%. He also stood in the 1989 European election, placing eighth out of ten candidates.
Democratic Left.
In 1992, Lynch sided with the split from the Workers' Party which produced Democratic Left, and he became the new group's main figure in Northern Ireland. Standing for the new organisation, at the 1992 UK general election his vote fell to 3.7% and he lost his council seat the following year. His last contest for the party was heading its North Belfast list for the Northern Ireland Assembly election in 1996, but the list took only 123 votes. Democratic Left dissolved in 1998, its members invited to join the Labour Party but not permitted to organise in Northern Ireland.
In 2003, Lynch was elected Chairman of the North Belfast sub-group of the Belfast District Policing Partnership. He is a Public Affairs Officer with Age NI.

Kotjebi

Kotjebi, kotchebi, or ggotjebi () is a Korean term denoting North Korean homeless children. The term literally means "flowering (꽃) swallows (제비)", given because of the kotjebi's constant search for food and shelter. The kotjebi are not officially recognized in North Korea, with any mention of the term being prohibited in state publications and documents.
Origins and status.
The orphaned kotjebi first appeared "en masse" in the mid-1990s in the wake of the North Korean famine, which collapsed the food distribution system. In an effort to "stabilize the livelihood of vagrants throughout the country", the North Korean government established special "Children's Detention Camps" in 1995, which were effectively rundown apartments. Because of poor conditions in the detention camps children have died of malnutrition.
Livelihood.
The kotjebi are constantly forced to seek food and thus gather in groups to beg and pickpocket. Most of the kotjebi eat only once a day. The diet of the kotjebi, along with the food they obtain from begging, consists mainly of grass soup, wild vegetable porridge, and grass roots.

Kya Rosa, University of Pretoria

Kya Rosa is a beautifully decorated late-Victorian house at the main entrance to the University of Pretoria.
The original building was constructed in Skinner Street in 1895 and belonged to Leo Weinthal, owner of The Press (forerunner of Pretoria News). It was named after his wife, Rosa. The word ‘Kya’ is the Zulu word for ‘house’. Kya Rosa later became the first home of the then Transvaal University College (TUC) – the predecessor of the University of Pretoria – but by 1915 it was no longer in use. In 1980, the University commissioned the construction of a replica of the house where it stands today – at the Roper Street entrance to the University. Work began in 1983, under the guidance of architect Albrecht Holm, an alumnus of the University of Pretoria. Precise measurements were taken from the original building and old photographs were used as reference to ensure that the reconstructed building closely resembles the original house. Many of the original Victorian fittings were used in the reconstruction. Today Kya Rosa houses the Office for Alumni Relations and incorporates a small conference and entertainment centre. The house was officially opened by Dr Anton Rupert on 25 October 1985.

USS PC-568

USS "PC-568" was a built for the United States Navy during World War II. The ship was later named USS "Altus" (PC-568) in honor of Altus, Oklahoma, but never saw any active service under that name. After she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1963, she was transferred to the United States Air Force.
Career.
"PC-568" was laid down by Brown Shipbuilding Company in Houston, Texas on 15 September 1941, launched on 25 April 1942, and commissioned on 13 July 1942 with Lt. David A. Smith in command.
Following a brief period of shakedown training, the submarine chaser reported to Commander, Caribbean Sea Frontier, for duty. The vessel carried out convoy and antisubmarine patrols from Key West and Miami, Florida to various ports in the Caribbean. Among her ports of call were Guantanamo Bay and Havana, Cuba, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Bridgetown, Barbados, Trinidad, Aruba, and Curaçao. In April 1943, "PC-568" reported to Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier, and began a series of convoy and antisubmarine patrols from New York City to Guantanamo Bay.
On 25 March 1944, the submarine chaser departed New York City and proceeded to the United Kingdom. Upon her arrival the ship reported to Commander, United States Naval Forces Europe, and became a member of the 12th Fleet. "PC-568" then became involved in preparations for the Allied invasion of France. When the assault troops first went ashore on the beaches of Normandy, on 6 June, the submarine chaser assumed convoy duty in the English Channel and also carried out patrol duty along the French coast.
"PC-568" operated in the English Channel through June 1945. In that month, she began providing services to American occupation forces in Germany. The ship remained in this role through 4 October, when she set sail from Bremerhaven, Germany, bound for the United States. She visited Plymouth, England, Ponta del Gada, Azores, and Bermuda before arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 October.
Preparations for deactivation of the vessel were then begun at Norfolk. She got underway again on 8 January 1946 to sail to Mayport, Florida. PC-568 was decommissioned on 30 April 1946 and was laid up in the St. Johns River, Green Cove Springs, Florida. In February 1956, the ship was named "Altus". Her name was struck from the Navy list on 15 March 1963, and the ship was transferred permanently to the custody of the United States Air Force.

Thomas Williams (general)

Thomas R. Williams (January 16, 1815 – August 5, 1862) was an antebellum United States Army officer and a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was killed as he commanded the Union troops at the Battle of Baton Rouge.
Birth and early years.
Williams was born in 1815 in Albany, New York. His father was General John R. Williams, a five-term Mayor of Detroit and prominent military figure in Michigan. His mother was Mary Mott Williams of one of Albany's leading families.
Military career.
He began his military service in 1832 as a private in an infantry company during the Black Hawk War, serving as a trumpeter under his father's command. 
The following year, Williams received an appointment to attend the United States Military Academy, then graduated in the Class of 1837 and he also taught mathematics at West Point in 1844. He was breveted as a second lieutenant of the 4th U. S. Artillery. He later served in the Seminole Wars as a first Lieutenant and Assistant Commissary of Substance. Williams served in the Mexican War and was brevetted as a captain on August 20, 1847. He was brevetted as a major on September 13, 1847, for "meritorious service" in the war. 
Following the Mexican War, Williams was promoted to full captain and posted to Mackinac Island, Michigan, where he met and married Mary Neosho Bailey, daughter of a prominent physician. He was later assigned to posts in Florida and the Utah Territory. By the late 1850s, he was serving as an instructor at the Artillery School at Fort Monroe in Virginia.
Civil War and death.
Shortly after the Civil War began, Williams was promoted to major in the 5th U. S. Artillery on May 14, 1861. On September 28, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln promoted Williams to Brigadier General of U. S. Volunteers, to rank from that date and on February 3, 1862, the U.S. Senate confirmed his nomination. He was posted to the command of a brigade on the Potomac River, and was later posted to Fort Hatteras, North Carolina. He then was assigned to Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's command in the land operations against New Orleans, Louisiana. Williams and his brigade were assigned the task of occupying Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On May 29, General Williams arrived in the city with six regiments of infantry, two artillery batteries, and a troop of cavalry.
During the early summer, Williams' 3,000-man infantry brigade began work on what later became known as Grant's Canal, cutting a new channel across the base of De Soto Point on the west side of the Mississippi River across from Vicksburg, Mississippi. The purpose of the canal was to develop a channel for navigation that would enable gunboats and transports to bypass the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg.
In August 1862, Confederate forces under the command of Gen. John C. Breckinridge attacked the Union defenses of Baton Rouge in an effort to retake the state's capital. Thomas Williams was killed by a gunshot wound to his chest while leading what proved to be the successful defense of the city.
He was buried in the family plot in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit, Michigan.
Relations.
One of his sons, Gershom Mott Williams, the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Marquette, later published General Williams' personal papers.

<doc id="18829015" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18829015" title="AMX-30E">
AMX-30E

The AMX-30E ("E" stands for "España", Spanish for Spain) was a main battle tank, based on the French AMX-30. Although originally the Spanish government sought to procure the German Leopard 1, the AMX-30 was ultimately awarded the contract due to its lower price and the ability to manufacture it in Spain. It was manufactured by Santa Bárbara Sistemas for the Spanish Army, between 1974 and 1983.
First acquired in 1970, the tank was to supplement Spain's fleet of M47 and M48 Patton United States tanks and to reduce Spain's reliance on American equipment in its army. The first 19 AMX-30 tanks were acquired from France in 1970, while another 180 were assembled in Spain. It was Spain's first mass-produced tank and developed the country's industry to the point where the government felt it could produce a tank on its own, leading to the development of the Lince tank project in 1985. It also offered Santa Bárbara Sistemas the experience which led to the production of the Leopard 2E in late 2003. Although final assembly was carried out by Santa Bárbara Sistemas, the production of the AMX-30E also included other companies in the country. Total production within Spain amounted to as much as 65% of the tank.
Spain's AMX-30E fleet went through two separate modifications in the late 1980s, a modernization program and a reconstruction program. The former, named the AMX-30EM2 (150 tanks), sought to modernize and improve the vehicle's automotive characteristics, while the latter, or the AMX-30EM1 (149 tanks), resulted in a more austere improvement of the tank's power plant by maintaining the existing engine and replacing the transmission. Both programs extended the vehicle's lifetime. Spain's fleet of AMX-30EM1s was replaced in the late 1990s by the German Leopard 2A4, and the AMX-30EM2s were replaced by Centauro wheeled anti-tank vehicles in the early 21st century.
Although 19 AMX-30Es were deployed to the Spanish Sahara in 1970, the tank never saw combat. In 1985 Indonesia expressed interest in the AMX-30E, while in 2004 the Spanish and Colombian governments discussed the possible sale of around 40 AMX-30EM2s. Both trade deals fell through.
Background.
In 1960, Spain's tank fleet was composed mainly of American M47 Patton tanks, with some newer M48 Patton tanks. The M47s had been acquired by the Spanish army in the mid-1950s, replacing the previous fleet of Panzer I, T-26 and Panzer IV tanks. The United States' ban on the usage of American ordnance supplied as military aid to Spain during the Ifni War pushed Spain to look for alternative equipment which could be freely employed in the Spanish Sahara.
In the early 1960s, Spain looked towards its European neighbors for a new tank. The Spanish government first approached Krauss-Maffei, the German manufacturer of the Leopard 1, and the company applied for an export license from the German Economics Ministry. Spain's status as a non-NATO country meant that the decision to grant the export license had to be reviewed by the "Bundessicherheitsrat" (Federal Security Council), or the BSR, which was responsible for the coordination of the national defense policy. Ultimately, the council ruled that Krauss-Maffei could sign an export contract with Spain. The deal was, however, stalled by pressure from United Kingdom's Labour Party on the basis that the Leopard's 105-millimeter (4.13 in) L7 tank gun was British technology. Meanwhile, Spain tested the French AMX-30 between 2 and 10 June 1964.
The Leopard 1 and the AMX-30 originated from a joint tank development program known as the Europanzer. For a tank, the AMX-30 had a low silhouette; the height of the tank was 2.28 meters (7.48 ft), compared to the Leopard's 2.6 meters (8.53 ft). In terms of lethality, the AMX-30's "Obus G" high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round was one of the most advanced projectiles at the time. Because HEAT warheads become less efficient during spin stabilization induced by the rifling of a tank-gun barrel, the "Obus G" was designed so that the shaped charge warhead was mounted on ball bearings within an outer casing, allowing the round to be spin stabilized through the rifling of the gun without affecting the warhead inside. The "Obus G" was designed to penetrate up to 400 millimeters (15.75 in.) of steel armor. On the other hand, the Leopard was armed with the L7A3 tank gun, capable of penetrating the frontal armor of most contemporary tanks. Although the Leopard boasted greater armor than the AMX-30—partially accounting for the weight difference between the two tanks—the latter was sold at a cheaper price.
In May 1970, the Spanish government decided to sign a contract with the French company GIAT to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not the advantages of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.
Production.
On 22 June 1970, the Spanish Ministry of Defense signed an agreement of military cooperation with France, which outlined plans for the future acquisition of around 200 tanks for the Spanish Army. Of these, 180 were to be manufactured under license in Spain and 20 were to be manufactured by France. Ultimately, GIAT was contracted to manufacture 19 tanks. These were delivered to the Spanish Legion's "Bakali" company, deployed in the Spanish Sahara. The first six AMX-30s were delivered by rail to the Spanish border city of Irún, in the Basque Country, and then transferred to Bilbao. Finally, they were shipped by the Spanish Navy, on the transport "Almirante Lobo", to El Aaiún in the Spanish Sahara. This unit existed until 1975, when it was disbanded and its tanks transferred to the "Uad-Ras" Mechanized Infantry Regiment.
This agreement laid the foundations for the upcoming tank plant at the industrial polygon of "Las Canteras", near the town of Alcalá de Guadaíra. Several parts of the tank were subcontracted to other Spanish companies, including "Astilleros Españoles" (turret), "Boetticher", "Duro Felguera" and E.N. Bazán. The grade of local production varied per batch. The first 20 tanks were to have 18% of each vehicle manufactured in Spain; the next 40 would have 40% of the vehicle manufactured in Spain. The other 120 had 65% of the tank manufactured in the country. Production began in 1974, at a rate of five tanks per month, and ended on 25 June 1979. The first five tanks were delivered to the "Uad Ras" Mechanized Infantry Regiment on 30 October 1974. This batch also replaced the M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks and M48 Patton tanks in the Armored Cavalry Regiment "Villaviciosa" and the Armored Infantry Regiment "Alcázar de Toledo", receiving 23 and 44 tanks, respectively.
On 27 March 1979, prior to the end of production of the first batch, the Spanish Army and Santa Bárbara Sistemas signed a contract for the production and delivery of a second batch of 100 AMX-30Es. In 1980, after the 200th AMX-30E was delivered to the Spanish Army, the tank's patent was awarded to Spain. This allowed minor modifications to be done to the vehicle without having to consult GIAT. It also meant that the degree of local construction of each vehicle augmented considerably. Production of the second batch lasted between 1979 and 1983. By the time production ended, the Spanish Army fielded 299 AMX-30Es (280 produced between 1974 and 1983, and 19 delivered from France in 1970) and 4 training vehicles delivered in 1975. Santa Bárbara Sistemas also manufactured 18 "Roland España" (denominated AMX-30RE) anti-air vehicles and 10 AMX-30D armored recovery vehicles. The average cost per tank, in the first batch, was 45 million pesetas (642,800 dollars). Cost per tank increased during the second batch to 62 million pesetas (885,700 dollars).
Although brand new, the AMX-30E entered service with automotive issues, including problems with the antiquated 5SD-200D transmission. Consequently, as the first production batch began to end, the Spanish Army and Santa Bárbara Sistemas began to study possible upgrades. The main objectives were to increase the power and the reliability of the power pack, an improvement to the tank's firepower and accuracy, as well as to increase the vehicle's ballistic protection and overall survivability. A number of modernization packages were proposed, including a suggestion to mount the AMX-30E's turret on a Leopard 1's chassis. Other options included swapping the existing power pack for a new American diesel engine and transmission or exchanging the power pack for a new German diesel engine and transmission. More austere versions of these same options were offered, pairing the existing HS-110 engine with the already mentioned transmissions. Another prototype was produced using the Leopard's more modern tracks, and another similar prototype mounted a new 12.7-millimeter (0.5 in.) machine gun for the loader's position. France's GIAT also offered to modernize Spain's AMX-30Es to AMX-30B2 standards, a modernization being applied to French AMX-30s.
Modernization.
Ultimately, a mixed solution named "Tecnología Santa Bárbara-Bazán" (Santa Bárbara-Bazán Technology) (or TSB) was chosen. The improvement of the tank's mobility entailed replacing the HS-110 diesel engine with an MTU 833 Ka-501 diesel engine, producing 850 metric horsepower (625.17 kW), and the transmission with a German ZF LSG-3000, compatible with engines of up to 1,500 metric horsepower (1103.25 kW). The first 30 engines were to have 50% of the engine manufactured in Spain; the rest, 73% were to be produced indigenously. This new engine gave the modernized tank a power ratio of 23 metric horsepower per tonne (21.13 hp/S/T). The new engine was coupled with the AMX-30B2's improved torsion-bar suspension, which used larger diameter torsion-bars and new shocks.
To improve the tank's firepower, the gun mount around the loader's turret hatch was modified to allow the installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5 in.) machine gun, while the main gun's firepower was augmented through the introduction of the new CETME437A armor piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS). The gun's accuracy was improved through the installation of the new Mark 9 modification A/D fire control system, designed by Hughes Aircraft Company. The new system allowed firing during the day and during night operations, and increased the likelihood of a first round impact (meaning, the chances of the first projectile fired by the gun hitting its target). The fire control system was also modernized through the exchange of the old M282 gunner's periscope with a new periscope and a new laser rangefinder. A new ballistic computer, the NSC-800, was issued, as well as a new digital panel for the gunner, designed and manufactured by the Spanish company INISEL. The tank commander also received a control unit that allowed the choice of ammunition for the gun and provided information on the ballistics of the round and the target to be engaged. As a result, the loader received a presentation unit to display information on which round to load into the gun's breech and to communicate ballistic data received, including angular velocity, wind velocity, gun elevation and vehicle inclination. The fire control system also allowed for the future upgrade to a more sophisticated stabilization system for the tank's main gun. Survivability improvements included the addition of new steel side-skirts, a new smoke generating system linked to the engine and a new fire suppression system.
One hundred fifty AMX-30Es received this modernization package and were designated AMX-30EM2s. The program began in 1989 and ended in 1993. Ultimately, Spain's AMX-30EM2s were replaced by brand-new Centauro anti-tank vehicles, which were partially manufactured in Spain, in the early 21st century.
Reconstruction.
The other 149 AMX-30Es were reconstructed to improve their mobility. The reconstruction consisted of the replacement of the original French transmission with the American Allison CD-850-6A. Furthermore, several parts of the tank, such as the brakes, were renovated in order to bring them up to their original standards. The CD-850-6A was an automatic transmission, with a triple differential providing two forward velocities and one reverse velocity. However, the new transmission resulted in a new problem. The excessive heat produced by the transmission reduced the vehicle's range. The reconstruction of the 149 AMX-30Es began in 1988, and these were designated AMX-30EM1s. In the early 1990s Spain received a large amount of M60 Patton tanks, replacing its fleet of M47s and M48s, as well as its AMX-30EM1s.
Export.
In the mid-1980s Indonesia approached Spain in an attempt to procure armaments for the modernization of its armed forces. Of the possible armaments for sale, Indonesia expressed interest in the procurement of the AMX-30. Although this deal fell through, in 2004 the Spanish and Colombian governments agreed on the sale of between 33 and 46 second-hand AMX-30EM2s, which had recently been replaced in the Spanish Army. However, the deal was canceled after José María Aznar was replaced by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero as prime minister of Spain—the new Spanish government declared that Spain didn't even have enough AMX-30EM2s in working condition to sell to Colombia.

Homecoming (Masters of Horror)

Homecoming is the sixth episode of the first season of "Masters of Horror". It originally aired in North America on December 2, 2005. It is loosely based on the 2002 short story "Death & Suffrage" by Dale Bailey.
Plot.
An unnamed president (whose appearance is modeled after Bill Clinton and whose voice is modeled after George W. Bush) is running for reelection during a divisive war, and one of his speech writers, David Murch (Jon Tenney ("The Stepfather", "Legion")), goes on TV to speak with talk show host Marty Clark (Terry David Mulligan) and strident right-wing sexpot (and Ann Coulter-like) Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill). Another guest is Janet Hofstader (Beverly Breuer), the Cindy Sheehan-like mother of a dead soldier, who demands to know what her son died for. Murch gets a bit teary-eyed and explains that he lost his older brother Philip (Ryan McDonnell) in Vietnam. 
"Believe me," he tells the grieving mom, "if I had one wish, I would wish for your son to come back, because I know he would tell us how important this struggle is." Cleaver is so impressed with Murch's handling of the situation that she takes him out for a drink later, picks his brain, and eventually seduces him. The Karl Rove-like Kurt Rand (Dante regular Robert Picardo) interrupts their tryst, calling to let Murch know that the president plans to make his line part of his stump speech. 
Soon, the soldiers killed in Iraq do start returning from the dead, and it doesn't go the way Murch predicted. They are not back to feast on the living, but unhappily for the president and his supporters, they just want a chance to vote in the upcoming election. "We'll vote for anyone who ends this war," one explains. The spin machine goes into overdrive, but the dead are determined to make their voice heard even going as far as one soldier killing Kurt Rand by acting out the zombie stereotype (gouging his eye and slamming his head into the table) when Rand tried to force him to sign an unwanted document by threatening the soldier's mother.
While voting results are being counted during the election, people within the current administration decide to skew the results so the current administration remains in power. After the election results are broadcast, more soldiers begin to return from the dead - but not just ones from Iraq: Soldiers begin to return from World War I and II, the Vietnam War, the Civil War, and etc. Eventually all of the people who died during war time to protect the United States of America have returned from the dead.
The progress of the movie also reveals a shadowy mistake from Murch's past. He believed that his brother Philip was murdered in the Vietnam War only to discover that it was he who unintentionally killed him long ago with a gun in a game of "friend or foe". After Cleaver attacks the soldiers with her shotgun, Murch kills her, but fails to kill himself. Murch is countered by a soldier that asks him to join them, saying "We're looking for a few good men." Philip is among those returning from the grave, saying he forgives Murch for killing him, and then snaps Murch's neck. 
Now one of the zombies, Murch announces that he will show anyone who sends their brothers and sisters to die for a lie the true face of hell.
DVD and Blu-ray.
The DVD was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment on July 18, 2006. The episode was the sixth episode and the seventh to be released on DVD. The episode appears on the fourth volume of the Blu-ray compilation of the series.
References to popular culture.
During the scene where the dead rise from their graves the gravestones are marked with the names of Jacques Tourneur, George A. Romero, Jean Yarbrough and Delbert Tenney, which are other zombie film directors.
Reception.
The episode received generally favorably reviews. "Village Voice" described the film as "easily one of the most important political films of the Bush II era." a sentiment echoed by "The New Yorker", who said that it was "best political film of 2005."

Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes

Louis Auguste de Bourbon, Prince of Dombes (Palace of Versailles, 4 March 1700 - Palace of Fontainebleau, 1 October 1755) was a grandson of Louis XIV of France and of his "maîtresse-en-titre" Françoise-Athénaïs de Montespan. He was a member of the legitimised House of Bourbon-Maine.
Biography.
Born at the Palace of Versailles on 4 March 1700, Louis-Auguste was the fourth child of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, "duc du Maine" and of his wife, Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon. 
Given the title of "prince de Dombes" at his birth, he was the second child of his parents to hold the title. 
Unlike his father, the prince de Dombes was of high military skill. Louis-Auguste served under the renowned military commander Prince Eugene of Savoy in the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718). He also fought in the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1738) and in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748).
Upon the death of his father (to whom he was very close), on 14 May 1736 at the Château de Sceaux, he inherited the bulk of his wealth and his titles. 
He became Colonel General of the "Cent-Suisses et Grisons" (1710), Governor of Languedoc (1737), Grand veneur de France and Count of Eu (1736).
In 1750, he gained the titles of "prince d'Anet" and "comte de Dreux", when his mother gave him both estates three years before she died. Little seen at the court of his cousin Louis XV of France, he preferred living at the Château d'Anet, which he continued to embellish. In order to supply water for his gardens, he created a hydraulic system which he installed in the park of the domain near the Eure River. He also enjoyed hunting on his large estate of Eu. 
Louis-Auguste remained unmarried and died childless. A possible wife had been his cousin, Charlotte Aglaé d'Orléans, daughter of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and Françoise-Marie de Bourbon, and another cousin, Louise Anne de Bourbon, daughter of Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, the duc du Maine's younger sister. 
Louis-Auguste died on 1 October 1755, at the age of fifty-five, in a duel at Fontainebleau. His younger brother, Louis Charles, was his only heir.

George Elder

George Elder (11 August 1793 in Hardin's Creek, Kentucky 28 September 1838 in Bardstown, Kentucky) was a pioneer Roman Catholic educator.
Life.
His parents, James Elder and Ann Richards, natives of Maryland, moved shortly after their marriage to Hardin's Creek, in the present Marion County, Kentucky, where George, the second of their seven children was born. The Elders were Catholics, and George's early education devolved mainly upon his father.
George Elder in his sixteenth year entered Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, to pursue classical studies. Here, he became the friend of William Byrne, afterwards founder of St. Mary's College, Kentucky, in George Elder's hometown. Both studied theology in St. Mary's Seminary, Baltimore, and were ordained priests at Bardstown by Bishop John David on September 18, 1819. In addition to the duties of an assistant at the cathedral there, Father Elder was entrusted by Bishop Flaget with the founding of a high-grade school or college for lay students. This was, at first, a day school and was taught in the basement of the theological seminary (erected in 1818). A separate building was erected in 1820-23. 
The college was then one of the largest and best-appointed educational structures in the entire West. (The community of Hardin's Creek would later be renamed "St. Mary" in its honor.) The arrival, in 1825, of fifty Southern students was the beginning of the extensive patronage the college received from the Southern states, notably Louisiana and Mississippi, and which continued down to the American Civil War. In 1827, the Rev. Ignatius A. Reynolds (later Bishop of Charleston) was appointed president and Father Elder was given charge of the congregation of St. Pius, in Scott County, Kentucky. 
Dr. Reynolds was transferred in 1830 to pastoral work, and Father Elder again became president, a position which he held until his death. He frequently did duty in the cathedral and was one of the editors of the Louisville "Catholic Advocate" newspaper (founded 1836), to which he contributed articles on the education of children. "Letters to Brother Jonathan", half satirical, half controversial, were also the product of his pen. 
He prosecuted a Presbyterian preacher, Nathan L. Rice, for libeling a Kentucky priest who was then absent in Europe. His last illness followed the burning down (25 January 1838) of the main college building.

103rd Regiment (Calgary Rifles)

The 103rd Regiment (Calgary Rifles) was an infantry regiment of the Canadian non-permanent militia, organized at Calgary, Alberta, Canada, by General Order on 1 April 1910.
History.
The 103rd Regiment was raised in Calgary as a militia unit. The first commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel W.C.G. Armstrong. The regiment's 1st Battalion consisted of eight companies stationed in Calgary. 
At the outbreak of World War I the regiment served as a recruiting depot to raise battalions for the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), the first being the 10th Battalion, CEF. The 103rd Regiment was reorganized into two regiments in 1920 (the Calgary Regiment and the Alberta Regiment), each of which was reorganized into two regiments a few years later. 
One of the resulting four regiments (the North Alberta Regiment) was disbanded in the 1936 reorganization of the Militia, but three present-day regiments claim descent from the 103rd: the South Alberta Light Horse, the King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC) and the Calgary Highlanders.

Garden-based learning

Garden-based learning (GBL) encompasses programs, activities and projects in which the garden is the foundation for integrated learning, in and across disciplines, through active, engaging real-world experiences that have personal meaning for children, youth, adults and communities. 
Garden-based learning is essentially an instructional strategy that utilizes the garden as a teaching tool. The practice of garden-based learning is a growing global phenomenon. In some settings it is the educational curriculum and in others it supports or enriches the curriculum. Nevertheless, garden-based learning has been viewed as contributing to all aspects of basic education, including academic skills, personal development, social development, moral development, vocational and/or subsistence skills, and life skills.
Benefits of garden-based learning among children and youth.
Landscape designers, teachers, and others consider children’s gardens to be one of the most notable positive trends in the nation today. These environments can foster science literacy and social skills, while enhancing an awareness of the link between plants in the landscape and our clothing, food, shelter, and well-being. Gardening projects provide children and youth with the carefree exploration of the natural world that occurs rarely in today's era of indoor living; it can also give young people the chance to develop a wide range of academic and social skills. Noted benefits of garden-based learning programs among youth include increased nutrition awareness, environmental awareness, higher learning achievements, and increased life skills [http://www.hort.cornell.edu/gbl/groundwork/researchsupports.html]. 
Increased nutrition awareness
Research indicates that youth who participate in garden-based learning programs have increased their consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and gained new enthusiasm for fresh, nutritious vegetables they grew. Teachers also regarded the garden to be very effective at enhancing academic performance, physical activity, language arts, and healthful eating habits.
Increased environmental awareness
Research highlights that high school students gain more positive attitudes about environmental issues after participating in a school garden program. Gardening has also been shown to increase scores on environmental attitude surveys of elementary school children.
Higher Learning Achievements
Studies indicate that students that participated in school gardening activities scored significantly higher on science achievement tests compared to students that did not experience any garden-based learning activities. Other research has indicated that weekly use of gardening activities and hands-on classroom activities help improve science achievement test scores.
Increased Life Skills
Research has highlighted the increased life skills attributed to children's garden programs: enhances moral education, increases appreciation for nature, increases responsibility, develops patience, increases in relationship skill, increases self-esteem, helps students develop a sense of ownership and responsibility, and helps foster relationships with family members.
Keys to successful garden-based learning programs.
Research has indicated that successful garden-based learning programs demonstrate high levels of youth development and leadership, community development and involvement, and participatory evaluation as a regular program feature. Programs are considered to be more successful when children and youth are involved in the entire process of the school gardening program (planning, design, implementation, and evaluation).

Aroldo Tieri

Aroldo Tieri (28 August 1917 – 28 December 2006) was an Italian actor. He appeared in 107 films between 1939 and 1969.
Career.
Born in Corigliano Calabro, son of the journalist and playwright Vincenzo Tieri, Aroldo Tieri moved in Rome at 18 to study law at university, and in the meanwhile approached acting and enrolled the Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico. Graduated in 1938, he almost immediately made his debut in theater and in film. Soon Tieri became one of the most popular and appreciated young actors, with a predisposition to the comic genre. In cinema Tieri specialized in roles on jealous, irascible, nervous boyfriends, and this characterization limited his career and caused his retirement from films in late 1960s. His versatility was revealed especially on stage and on television, that at the end of the 50s gave him notoriety with a successful adaptation of the Dickens' novel "Nicholas Nickleby" and then as host of "Canzonissima" in 1960. Companion for many years on the scene of the actress Giuliana Lojodice, later his wife, Tieri formed a stage company with her in 1965 and the couple was very active in multiple projects at theater, radio and TV.

Imam Hossein University

The Imam Hossein University () 
is a military university that belongs to IRGC. It was established in 1986 and was aimed to train officers for IRGC. It is located in Tehran, Shahid Babaei Highway near Tehran-Pars Fourth Square, and Hakimiyeh. It is sometimes referred to as "IHU". It is named after Imam Hossein, a grandson of the Islamic prophet, who was martyred in 680. 
IHU has a military structure. Unlike other universities, IHU is organized like a military structure. Its chancellor is a commander from IRGC that appears in the university in the military uniform and is determined by Khamenei and commander of IRGC. Khamenei visits the university every year and makes the guidelines and policies for the university. For many years, soldier training and research parts were mixed together. Some years ago, during Khamenei's visit, he ordered the commander of IRGC to separate soldier training parts from research parts. Thereafter, two distinct parts were created and research parts removed to a different but near place.
IHU is not an ordinary university with free access. It is controlled by soldiers and military forces at the entrance. No one can enter the university without personnel cards or permissions from military officers. IHU was established to train members of IRGC. IRGC could persuade the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research and Technology to confirm IHU as a university but it is under supervision of IRGC and its staff are all members of IRGC. 
IHU provides Bachelors and Masters programs in 15 departments. The student body consists of 6000 students and soldiers, almost from members of IRGC or Basij. In order to receive financial benefits and to use the reputation of a public university, they gradually made it possible to take free students for unfilled capacities. Those students should pay tuition fees, they should be a member of Basij para-militia group, and they should pass ideological interviews before admission. Recently, they changed the conditions. Now, they try to provide scholarships for free students provided that they become employed in IRGC. They should pass ideological interviews and medical tests in order to be employed in IRGC and get admitted to IHU. Being a member of Basij will be an advantage.
History.
The university was established in 1986 by IRGC and named "Imam Hossein Higher Education". They could enforce the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research and Technology to approve it as a university. It included faculty of engineering, faculty of science, faculty of social science, and faculty of medicine in 1987. Consequently, it included faculty of military science. In 1994, the faculty of Medicine seceded to become the Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University, which is the primary medical institution for, and currently trains students up to PhD levels in three faculties, namely: Nursing, Allied Health, and Medicine, as well as the Institute of Research for Military Medicine.
Background.
In 1963, Iran placed all military factories under the Military Industries Organization (MIO) of the Ministry of War. Over the next fifteen years, they produced small arms ammunition, explosives, and mortar rounds and fuses. They furthermore produced rifles and machine guns under West German license. Additionally, they assembled helicopters, jeeps, trucks, and trailers from imported kits. However, the Iran Revolution stopped all activities. The MIO was unable to operate without foreign experts, so it had lost much of its management ability and control over its industrial facilities by 1981.
In late 1981, the revolutionary government brought together all military industrial units and placed them under the Defense Industries Organization (DIO). By 1986, a large number of infantry rifles, machine guns, and mortars and some small-arms ammunition were being manufactured locally. However, they required some specialists and technicians. For this purpose, they opened several universities and colleges e.g. Imam Hossein University, Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University, and Malek-Ashtar University of Technology, directly or indirectly linked to DIO by mid-1980s. 
Prior to 1989, they began working on the ballistic missiles program was responsibility of the missile unit in IRGC. In 1989, the Ministry of Defense and the Guards merged to form the Ministry of the Armed Forces Logistics, and the IRGC's facilities were merged into the Defense Industry Organization. By the mid-1990s, they were reportedly responsible for Iran's missile programs, headed by the Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO).
Research.
It has a scientific group and a nuclear physics department. 
The Imam Hossein University, which is particularly run on military lines by IRGC, is the center for experiments on nuclear research. Iranian scientists are conducting nuclear research and development using university laboratories.
However, it is not only a main center for nuclear research. It also has a place for biological research. The Imam Hossein University has a biological section that conducts microbial research. 
It was named by the German government as an Iranian military procurement organization working toward acquiring weapons of mass destruction; reportedly conducts nuclear development activities separate from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to US officials produces anthrax and aflatoxin.
During the 1990s, the Iranian regime centralized several centers for nuclear research programme under a single unit. They transferred all of their nuclear facilities around the country to the Defense Ministry and also to the Imam Hossein University. The announcement on the university's now defunct website shed light on one of Iran's developing nuclear programme and the laser enrichment technique. Prof. Raymond Tanter said that it particularly is importance to mention laser enrichment as a mean to create nuclear fuel. One of the most critical projects is conducted at the Imam Hossein University on use of lasers for enrichment. In addition to laser enrichment, the university carried out a test on neutron generator that can also trigger the fission chain reaction.
In January 2006, the university had the third nationwide congress on the modern defensive wars in the field of chemical, biological, nuclear wars as announced on the university's website, which is no longer online. According to the announcement, the congress discussed the new types of bombs, such as: electromagnetic, air fuelled, graphite, laser and enfeebling bombs. Prof. Raymond Tanter argued the conference was a part of the accelerating research and development on nuclear programme.
Physics Research Center.
According to the ElBaradei's report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the university (called a "technical university" in the report) houses the Physics Research Center (PHRC), which controls the Iranian nuclear program, once under the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Iran's civilian nuclear agency. One of the principal sources of nuclear experts has been the Imam Hossein University. Part of the takeover of the Iranian nuclear program also necessarily included transferring experts from around the country into this university. The IAEA stated the IRGC is believed to have co-opted the nuclear research facilities and experts of the university system in order to conceal and cloak the true military aspect of the Iranian nuclear program. For example, an Iranian company, Kimia Maadan (KM) Company, made use of experts from this university. The IAEA had also questions regarding the role and origin of KM Company. The company was founded by nuclear experts, a core staff about half a dozen experts who had previously worked for the Iranian Ore Processing Center (OPC). There are relationships among various university research teams, PHRC of the Imam Hossein University, the Education Research Institute (ERI) and the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) and KM Company, each working on different aspects of the Iranian nuclear program.
One of the research projects addressed in the IAEA report is the Iranian Green Salt Project, apparently managed by KM Company. The project performed a flowsheet of bench scale conversion of uranium oxide (UO2) into 1 ton of UF4 per year, also known as Green Salt. It is an early step in an enrichment process, beyond the capacity or scope of the Uranium Ore Concentration (UOC) plant. According to the IAEA report, KM Company designed and built a turnkey (flowsheet). The document also referred to the project concerning the missile re-entry vehicle. However, Iran answered that the flowsheets and allegations were baseless and fabrications, and the only project that the KM Company worked on was the UOC plant.
The IAEA has also reported the Iranian testing of multiple high-explosive detonators designs and documents the layout for an underground nuclear blast test facility in this university. 
In 2006, a senior US official revealed the Washington Post a diagram being schematically consistent with a nuclear test-site schematic in Iran. Later in 2006, a contingent of senior officers from Iran travelled to North Korea to see an underground facility to test explosion. IAEA also made question about the Iranian Shahab-3 missile designs. Specifically, re-entry vehicle designs are believed to be engineered for the ability to carry nuclear warheads.
The various scientific research groups of Iran's nuclear program, run from this university under the direction of the IRGC, are including efforts to obtain training courses and software on spark gaps, shock wave software, neutron sources, special steel parts, radiation measurement equipment, including borehole spectrometers. Nonetheless, Iran answered that it sought PAM shock software to study aircraft, collision of cars, airbags and for the design of seatbelts.
Biological Research Center.
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) made a report about the biological activities in Iran, which are centered on the productions of microbial bombs using anthrax, smallpox virus, typhoid fever, high dosage of aflatoxin, plague microbes, and chloromicrobes, done at the Imam Hossein University in Tehran. Genetic cloning is also being carried out at Malek-Ashtar University of Technology.
These claims were provided by the National Council of Resistance of Iran in a press conference at the Willard Hotel in Washington on 15 May 2003. 
The activities about biological weapons began in 1985, during the Iran-Iraq War. In 1985 and 1986, they established a research center in the Pasteur Institute of Iran in Tehran to work on toxic fungus and microbial substances. The center succeeded in producing toxic fungus, including aflatoxin. In the next years, as they succeeded in mass production of microbial material, they moved the production centers to the Imam Hossein University. Centers such as Pasteur Institute are now being used for research purposes.
A number of foreign microbial experts from China, North Korea, India, and Russia are cooperating with the Ministry of Defense of Iran.
A number of them have been hired by this organization. The Biological Research Center of Special Industries Organization is located at Shahid Meisami and Martyr Meisami complex. Also, students are given scholarships to study and use technology. The Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University, affiliated with the Baqiyatallah Hospital, is another center which works on microbial works. The Research Center for Direct Biotechnology does not directly work on microbial bombs, but it's used as the research supplement for biological weapons and actively works with Malek-Ashtar University of Technology and Imam Hossein University, as well as the Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University. Notwithstanding, the Centers for Science and Technological Growth of the Biological Research Center of Malek Ashtar, affiliated with the defense industries, are in charge of mass production of biological weapons. 
In addition, the Sina Industry (previously named Vira Laboratories) are concentrated on production of the biological materials. It is a center that has been active since 1990. It is one of the most important biological and chemical laboratories of Iran. It seems that basically used as a front, as a cover for doing their research and their activities on biological weapons under the cover and the name of medical research. In this center, the microbial tests are done on animals. Nonetheless, all claims about biological weapons have been rejected by the Iranian government. 
Chemical Research Center.
The Imam Hossein University is involved in chemical technology, offering scholarships in this subject. Since 1999, they have pursued the chemical research in a much larger scale. One of the projects was to build a fermentor. The 24th Bessat group linked to this university produces a significant amount of nerve gas in liquid, vapor, and powder form. Cyanide, Tri-glycol, Sodium Cyanide are produced for chemical purposes as well. 
Another Organization runs by the Defense Ministry is one of the agencies involved in producing chemical products. They have more than 4,000 employees, a chemical laboratory named Vira Laboratories, and a chemical material storage known as Shahid Meisami. The Parchin Chemical Industries located in south of Tehran, is another center of chemical products. It includes storage and glass body equipment to produce lethal nerve gas. Much of the equipment has been received from Hungarian manufacturer, Lampert. Another complex manufacturer near the city of Semnan is also engaged in producing nerve gas.
The center for chemical research and chemical engineering located in west of Tehran is also used for a joint research and technological study of Imam Hossein University and Malek-Ashtar University of Technology. The Chinese experts are supervising some research projects.
Aerospace Research Center.
The Imam Hossein University offers Aerospace Engineering degree programs at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It is among some universities in Iran, where provide the Aerospace Engineering degrees. These universities includes K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, Imam Hossein University, and Malek-Ashtar University of Technology. The Sharif University of Technology is the first university, where offers bachelor's degree and master's degree in the field of Aerospace Engineering and Aeronautical Engineering since 1987. The K.N. Toosi University of Technology has also Ph.D in Aerospace Engineering (Joint program with Moscow State Aviation Technological University in Russia). The Malek-Ashtar University of Technology is also involved in Aerospace research and programs related to Aerospace engineering.
Iran established the Iranian Space Agency in an uninhabited desert area in Semnan Province, south-east of Tehran in April 2003. The Center has a remote satellite command-and-control facility and a satellite launch pad. The Remote Space Sensing Center affiliated to the Ministry of Post and Telegraph and Technology launched three decades ago. The Aerospace Research Institute affiliated to the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology is another active organization in the space science and technology applications. The Meteorological Organization performs atmosphere analysis in support of agriculture, transportation, water, energy, and environment. Five public Universities, one private university (Azad University Science and Research Branch), and one college (Civil Aviation Technology College) provide higher education and research in aerospace engineering.
Iran started its scientific aerospace cooperation with China following the establishment of its Aerospace Organization in 2000. China has successfully launched forty satellites since 1996. In May 2005, Iran signed a regional research cooperation with China for the designing and launching satellites for long distance surveillance, subterranean resources, agrometeorology, and aerospace training at Iranian universities. Iran's Aerospace Organization's has been getting engaged in designing and manufacturing of a small multi-mission satellite with China and Thailand since 2005.
Since the 1990s, Iran started to develop a launch vehicle based on Shahab-3. The Shahab-3 is a liquid fueled single stage missile. The Iran Space Research Center started testing launch capabilities since early 2007 reaching 150–200 km altitude. These rockets were based on Shahab-3 series and were typically equipped with wind, air and temperature instruments. In August 2008, Iran developed a two stage launch vehicle Safir-1 which launched a dummy satellite. On February 2009, Iran launched a satellite named Omid into orbit using the domestically built launch vehicle Safir-2, thus becoming the 9th nation to do so on Timeline of first orbital launches by country. Their Aerospace engineering achievement appears as the country has been under nearly 30 years of sanctions.
Related Organizations.
Lavizan Technical Research Center.
Originally Lavizan was a heavily fortified Army Garrison housing Shah's Imperial Guards. During the Iranian Revolution, the garrison fell to Revolutionaries after a fight in which several officers of the guard were killed. The site was later on converted to a research facility.
The Lavizan Technical Site includes faculties of installations industries and metallurgy. According to a document, the alleged Iranian nuclear warheads were being stored in the Lavizan military camp in the Teheran area in 1992. Another document discusses the production of a solid fuel missile prototype completed in Lavizan.
A satellite image of 10 May 2004 showed that Iran had almost totally razed part of the Lavizan Technical Research Center. It showed Iran had been demolishing buildings at Lavizan. The Lavizan Center had imported a whole-body counter (WBC), a device used to identify and measure the radioactive material in the body of human beings and animals. On 29 June 2004, El Baradei said that Iran had accepted that the alleged concealed nuclear site in Tehran was a military-research complex before it was razed. The Iranian authorities stated that this was a physics institute later on turned to be a biotechnology research and development center.
Aerospace Industries Organization.
Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO) is a leading industrial subsidiary of the Ministry of Defense. More than 13 large factories with over 10,000 expert personnel are occupied in manufacturing a vast variety of military and non-military purposes. Products include different types of weapons such as guns, rockets, missiles, mortars, bombs, rocket launchers, field kitchens, gyroscopes, transportation means, police equipment, and helmets. Engineering services include precision machining, metal forming, software services, quality control test, dimensional measurement, CNC machine, and Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM).
The Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO), also known as the Sanam Industrial Group, is the Defense Industries Organization (DIO) Missile Industries Group. Sanam Industries Group is said to be the lead organization for the development of the Shahab-3 missile. In 1998, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation had reportedly negotiated an agreement with Sanam Industries Group to provide telemetry infrastructure for Iran's Shahab-3 and Shahab-4 ballistic missile.
Baltic State Technical University in Saint Petersburg has allegedly contracted with the Sanam Industrial group to train Iranian students in order to design long-range solid fuel rocket boosters. They together created a center known as Persepolis as part of a contract concluded in 1996. On 22 June 1998, Iranian students were expelled from Baltic State Technical University as part of Russia's international obligations to control the spread of missile technology.
In addition to military products, the Sanam Industrial Group also produces non-military products to convene domestic and export markets demands including TVs, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, various types of grinding wheels, stainless steel dishes, industrial fans, motor pumps, and automotive parts. The Sanam Washing Machine use Korean SAMSUNG technology, by which it becomes a powerful, economic and durable washing machine. Sanam Industrial Group in Parchin is licensed by the Italian company Lombardini to fabricate internal combustion engines, that are used in automotive, agricultural, industrial and marine applications.
Parchin Site.
Parchin Complex, 30 kilometers southeast of Tehran, was the site for the implementation of a variety of defense projects. 
Parchin was the center of the Defense Industries Organization's (DIO) Chemical industry, and, possibly, the home of the main producers of the Iran’s missiles. Parchin was opened in 1939, and was in operation since before the Second World War. Very few information was available about the post-Revolutionary Iranian arms industry. On 25 August 1999, it included the Parchin Chemical Factories (PCF). PCF was equipped with modern technology producing various commercial explosives, and chemical material. 
Parchin is one of Iran's major chemical weapons facilities, along with the facilities located at Damghan, Esfahan and Qazvin. US intelligence said Iran has been continuing to improve and develop its chemical warfare production infrastructure and munitions arsenal until 2003. US intelligence reporting Iran tries to dual-use facilities could quickly field chemical agents, but are not mainly active in military. It made also question the character of the facilities at Parchin.
On 29 December 2003, the Wall Street Journal reported that, Ahmad Shirzad, a deputy from the city of Isfahan, stated that there was a large nuclear underground facility in Parchin.
In an article in the Washington Times, on 7 March 2004, claimed that Iran's nuclear weapons program included use of Belarus-Russian filtering and high-temperature melting technologies for uranium enrichment. The accurate technique supposedly involved was unclear, but would appear to have been thermal diffusion. 
The generally Parchin institute represents the chief center of Iran's military industry, so a nuclear program would by now include all the proficiency required within commuting distance. The suspect area was physically isolated from other components, which implies that it was not part of the ammo, chemical or missile programs. The United States made also questions whether Iran is testing high explosives at Parchin. Nonetheless, Hossein Mousavian, Iran's chief delegate to the IAEA, rejected all claims about a nuclear testing area at Parchin. He categorically denied any nuclear activities in Parchin. He accused the US of deliberately using misinformation to embarrass Iran at IAEA hearings. 
Jay C. Davis, former head of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency at the US Department of Defense, said neither the design of the facility nor the nature of the tests is unique to nuclear weapons. Davis added that environmental sampling done by IAEA inspectors could detect the presence of by-products used in the testing of high explosives for a nuclear weapon. On 17 September 2004 IAEA head El Baradei said his organization had found no sign of nuclear-related activity at the Parchin site in Iran, which several US officials had said might be to secret nuclear weapons research. Iran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Parchin military site in the interests of transparency, but the visit was limited to only few areas.
On 1 March 2005, Iran abandoned a second request by the IAEA to visit again the Parchin site. However, the IAEA was eventually allowed entrance to the Parchin facility in November 2005. The IAEA did not observe any unusual activities in the buildings visited, and the results of the analysis of environmental samples did not indicate the presence of nuclear material.
Faculties.
Initially Imam Hossein University included four faculties:
Later another faculty was founded:
In 1994, faculty of Medicine seceded to become the Baqiyatallah Medical Sciences University.

Ailill mac Dúnlainge (died 871)

Ailill mac Dúnlainge (died 871) was a King of Leinster of the Uí Muiredaig sept of the Uí Dúnlainge branch of the Laigin. This sept had their royal seat at Maistiu (Mullaghmast) in South Kildare in what is now Ireland. He was the son of Dúnlaing mac Muiredaig (died 869), a previous king. He ruled from 869-871.
There is much confusion in the king lists during this period for Leinster. Ailill is the first person awarded the title King of Leinster in the "Annals of Ulster" at his death notice since 838. Francis John Byrne suggests that the root of this apparent confusion lay in the fact that the Uí Dúnlainge kings exercised little real authority due to the aggressions of their western neighbour Cerball mac Dúnlainge (died 888), King of Osraige. Cerball, while unable to install himself as king of Leinster, was able to prevent any rival king exercising real power there.
In 870 the high king Áed Findliath (died 879) invaded Leinster and overran it from Áth Cliath (Dublin) to Gabrán. Meanwhile his ally Cerball mac Dúnlainge (died 888) of Osraige invaded Leinster from the west. He reached Dún Bolg where his camp was attacked by the Laigin who were at first successful, but in a counter-attack they were put to flight. Ailill's name is not connected with these events which state that Muiredach mac Brain was the King of Leinster who fought the forces of Cerball. The "Fragmentary Annals" give a lengthy account of this event and state that Cerball met up with the high king's forces at Belach Gabrán (the pass of Gowran in east-central Osraighe) but both forces then retitred and the hostages of the Laigin were not taken.

St. Mary Coptic Orthodox Church (Lancaster, Pennsylvania)

St Mary Coptic Orthodox Church (Coptic: // transliteration: "ti.eklyseya en.remenkimi en.orthodoxos ente fi.ethowab Maria") is one of the oldest Coptic Orthodox churches established in Pennsylvania. It is one of over 200 Coptic Orthodox Churches in the US.
History.
St. Mary Coptic Orthodox Church is the second Coptic Orthodox church that was established in Pennsylvania, and was incorporated by 1975 with only 3 families at the time. It is located at the village of Silver Spring, Pennsylvania, a small, unincorporated town that has a relatively large proportion of Christian Orthodox Copts.
The oldest parish in Pennsylvania, which was incorporated in 1973, is St. George Coptic Orthodox Church in Norristown, Pennsylvania.
Expansion.
The year 1977 marked the first pastoral visit by HH Pope Shenouda III to the US and Canada, including St. Mark's Church in Jersey City, the first Coptic Orthodox Church in the United States. Ten years later, in January 1987, the building of St. Mark's Church was newly refitted and consecrated.
After a certain period of time, the small congregation of St. Mary's Church, with much help from the late Fouad Gad Youssef, founded the current building on Marietta Ave in 1980—with only five families at the time.
The current building of St. Mary's Church of Lancaster, as it is often known, was consecrated by a Coptic Orthodox Bishop in September 1982.
Today.
The Church was visited in 1989 by Pope Shenouda on his second visit (the first one being in 1977) to North America. Interestingly enough, this was the same year where the pope visited every Coptic parish in the US and Canada. Ever since the first two visits, Pope Shenouda has visited both Canada and the United States for every year afterwards.
St. Mary's Church, being located in Eastern Pennsylvania that is near the large Coptic population in New Jersey, was also visited by other Bishops of the Coptic Orthodox Church, although St. Mary's Church is already served by Fr. Estephanos A. Hanna.
Over the years, St. Mary Church of Lancaster has grown exponentially in recent years to over 125 families, serving congregants from Lancaster, Columbia, York, and Reading.

Rue de la Pompe

Rue de la Pompe is a street in Paris, France, which was named after the pump which served water to the castle of Muette. With a length of 1690 metres, Rue de la Pompe is one of the longest streets in the XVIe arrondissement. It runs from "Avenue Paul Doumer" (in the district of "Muette") to Avenue Foch (in the district of "Porte Dauphine").
Originally, it was a small way and first mentioned in 1730. For a long time, Rue de la Pompe, which runs from South to North, was together with "Rue de Longchamp" (which runs from East to West) the main axis of Passy whose terrain was mainly used for agricultural reasons until it became a part of Paris on January 1 of 1860.
Residence of famous people.
The house with number 1 lies in the southern part of the street and (with view from there) on the left side. Brigitte Bardot has spent a part of her childhood here.
Just a few steps further on the same side of the street – at the place where today is house number 11 – once stood a country house in which the writer and journalist Jules Janin moved around 1850: "It surely needs a lot of courage to settle in this wilderness, on a scarcely discernible way. The first three winters we have spent alone here, surrounded by this frightening isolation and this total silence."
During the summer 0f 2010 Jessica Talley, noted American photographer and dancer lived with the notorious socialite Eliza F M Wright on the top floor of number 11. 
His Grace Lord Lassus currently resides in number 12. 
In direct neighborhood grew up at nearly the same time the writer and caricaturist George du Maurier who was born on March 6, 1834 in Paris. In his first novel "Peter Ibbetson" (published in 1891), which has some autobiographical tendencies, the author is telling about happy days of childhood in the Rue de la Pompe:
"Our house, an old yellow house with green shutters and Mansard-roofs of slate, stood between the garden and the street - a long winding street ... on either side of the street (which was called "the Street of the Pump"), as far as the eye could reach looking west, were dwelling-houses just like our own, only agreeably different; and garden walls overtopped with the foliage of horse-chestnut, sycamore, acacia, and lime; and here and there huge portals and iron gates defended by posts of stone gave ingress to mysterious abodes of brick and plaster and granite, many-shuttered, and embosomed in sun-shot greenery." 
Not only his granddaughter, the writer Daphne du Maurier, was of the opinion that his depictions brought to life again old Passy and the Rue de la Pompe: "Kicky … was a happy little boy – or so he believed, when fifty years later he wrote about his childhood in Peter Ibbetson – and the scents and sounds of pre-imperial Paris, the rumble of wheels on cubbled stones, the crack of a whip, the white dust at the corner of the Rue de la Pompe, the chestnut trees in flower – even the small burnt bread, black coffee, and tobacco on the warm spring air – rise from the pages of his novel …"
Wistfully, George du Maurier has also dealt with the rapid alterations, Passy had been involved - especially as a result of the annexation to Paris on January 1, 1860. 12 years after he had been taken away from his beloved Passy to London by his uncle, his protagonist Peter Ibbetson returns to Passy for the first time: the old house was no more, but in its place a much larger and smarter edifice of sculptured stone. Also from the trusted apple-tree remained the stump only. But the old gate at least had not disappeared. "I feasted my sorrowful eyes on these poor remains, that looked snubbed and shabby and out of place in the midst of all this new splendor."
The old park hedge, which they often had crossed through a gap inside it, to get faster to and from the Bois de Boulogne, had also disappeared and "the very park itself was gone, cut up, demolished, all parcelled out into small gardens with trim white villas, except where a railway ran through a deep cutting in the chalk. A train actually roared and panted by, and choked me with its filthy steam as I looked round in stupefaction on the ruins of my long-cherished hope."
Some decades letter grew up another writer in the same street - and his childhood memories sound very similarly atrabilious like the narration by Du Maurier: "When I stroll around Passy I feel like wandering inside myself and always I am faced with my own childhood."
With the same melancholy, Du Maurier felt a century before, Julien Green is also writing about the many changes his home has suffered in time: "It is amazing how a quarter century could deprive all the former charm from this part of town. I know that it is useless and ridiculous to moan about vanished stones, but my impression is without leniency when I have a look at these tenements which are now occupy the heights in which I remember to have seen many old-fashioned elegant villas, and gardens who kept their silence and the singing of the birds like treasures." "And when I stroll down from the heights of Passy to the banks of the Seine, I sometimes ask myself where I am and if I have not dreamed."
Green lived on the left side of Rue de la Pompe (there where the odd numbers are) and visited Lycée Janson de Sailly with number 106, just across the street. Because he heard nothing but English at home (his parents were Americans) and nothing but French in school, Green described the Rue de la Pompe as "my Atlantic Ocean".
Also in opposite to the mentioned high school lived the French general Joseph Jacques Césaire Joffre (1852-1931) for 10 years, as a commemorative plaque on house number 115 reveals. 
Virginia Oldoini, Countess di Castiglione, an early photographic artist, secret agent, courtesan and mistress to royalty, was bought a small house on the street by Napoleon III in 1857.
In 1919, an apartment at 115 rue de la Pompe became the home of Irène Némirovsky, author of David Golder, Le Bal, and Suite Francaise, among other novels.

BeagleBoard

The BeagleBoard is a low-power open-source hardware single-board computer produced by Texas Instruments in association with Digi-Key and Newark element14. The BeagleBoard was also designed with open source software development in mind, and as a way of demonstrating the Texas Instrument's OMAP3530 system-on-a-chip. The board was developed by a small team of engineers as an educational board that could be used in colleges around the world to teach open source hardware and open source software capabilities. It is also sold to the public under the Creative Commons share-alike license.
Features.
The BeagleBoard measures approximately 75 by 75 mm and has all the functionality of a basic computer. The OMAP3530 includes an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU (which can run Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, RISC OS, or Symbian; Android is also being ported), a TMS320C64x+ DSP for accelerated video and audio decoding, and an Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX530 GPU to provide accelerated 2D and 3D rendering that supports OpenGL ES 2.0. Video out is provided through separate S-Video and HDMI connections. A single SD/MMC card slot supporting SDIO, a USB On-The-Go port, an RS-232 serial connection, a JTAG connection, and two stereo 3.5 mm jacks for audio in/out are provided.
Built-in storage and memory are provided through a PoP chip that includes 256 MB of NAND flash memory and 256 MB of RAM (128 MB on earlier models).
The board uses up to 2 W of power and can be powered from the USB connector, or a separate 5 V power supply. Because of the low power consumption, no additional cooling or heat sinks are required.
BeagleBoard.
Features.
A modified version of the BeagleBoard called the BeagleBoard-xM started shipping on August 27, 2010. The BeagleBoard-xM measures in at 82.55 by 82.55 mm and has a faster CPU core (clocked at 1 GHz compared to the 720 MHz of the BeagleBoard), more RAM (512 MB compared to 256 MB), onboard Ethernet jack, and 4 port USB hub. The BeagleBoard-xM lacks the onboard NAND and therefore requires the OS and other data to be stored on a microSD card. The addition of the Camera port to the -xM provides a simple way of importing video via Leopard Board cameras.
BeagleBone.
Announced in the end of October 2011, the BeagleBone is a barebone development board with a Sitara ARM Cortex-A8 processor running at 720 MHz, 256 MB of RAM, two 46-pin expansion connectors, on-chip Ethernet, a microSD slot, and a USB host port and multipurpose device port which includes low-level serial control and JTAG hardware debug connections, so no JTAG emulator is required. The BeagleBone is initially priced $89(US).
A number of BeagleBone "Capes" have recently been released. These capes are expansion boards which can be stacked onto the BeagleBone Board (up to four at one time). BeagleBone capes include but are not limited to:
BeagleBone Black.
Launched in April 23, 2013 at a price of $45. Among other differences, it increases RAM to 512 MB, the processor clock to 1 GHz, and it adds HDMI and 2 GB of eMMC flash memory. The BeagleBone Black also ships with Linux kernel 3.8, upgraded from the original BeagleBone's Linux kernel 3.2, allowing the BeagleBone Black to take advantage of Direct Rendering Manager (DRM).

Formal scheme

In mathematics, specifically in algebraic geometry, a formal scheme is a type of space which includes data about its surroundings. Unlike an ordinary scheme, a formal scheme includes infinitesimal data that, in effect, points in a direction off of the scheme. For this reason, formal schemes frequently appear in topics such as deformation theory. But the concept is also used to prove a theorem such as the theorem on formal functions, which is used to deduce theorems of interest for usual schemes.
A locally noetherian scheme is a locally noetherian formal scheme in the canonical way: the formal completion along itself. In other words, the category of locally noetherian formal schemes contains all locally noetherian schemes.
Definition.
Formal schemes are usually defined only in the Noetherian case. While there have been several definitions of non-Noetherian formal schemes, these encounter technical problems. Consequently we will only define locally noetherian formal schemes.
All rings will be assumed to be commutative and with unit. Let "A" be a (Noetherian) topological ring, that is, a ring "A" which is a topological space such that the operations of addition and multiplication are continuous. "A" is linearly topologized if zero has a base consisting of ideals. An ideal of definition formula_1 for a linearly topologized ring is an open ideal such that for every open neighborhood "V" of 0, there exists a positive integer "n" such that formula_2. A linearly topologized ring is preadmissible if it admits an ideal of definition, and it is admissible if it is also complete. (In the terminology of Bourbaki, this is "complete and separated".)
Assume that "A" is admissible, and let formula_1 be an ideal of definition. A prime ideal is open if and only if it contains formula_1. The set of open prime ideals of "A", or equivalently the set of prime ideals of formula_5, is the underlying topological space of the formal spectrum of "A", denoted Spf "A". Spf "A" has a structure sheaf which is defined using the structure sheaf of the spectrum of a ring. Let formula_6 be a neighborhood basis for zero consisting of ideals of definition. All the spectra of formula_7 have the same underlying topological space but a different structure sheaf. The structure sheaf of Spf "A" is the projective limit formula_8.
It can be shown that if "f" ∈ "A" and "D""f" is the set of all open prime ideals of "A" not containing "f", then formula_9, where formula_10 is the completion of the localization "A""f".
Finally, a locally noetherian formal scheme is a topologically ringed space formula_11 (that is, a ringed space whose sheaf of rings is a sheaf of topological rings) such that each point of formula_12 admits an open neighborhood isomorphic (as topologically ringed spaces) to the formal spectrum of a noetherian ring.
Morphisms between formal schemes.
A morphism formula_13 of locally noetherian formal schemes is a morphism of them as locally ringed spaces such that the induced map formula_14 is a continuous homomorphism of topological rings for any affine open subset "U".
"f" is said to be "adic" or "formula_12 is a formula_16-adic formal scheme" if there exists an ideal of definition formula_17 such that formula_18 is an ideal of definition for formula_12. If "f" is adic, then this property holds for any ideal of definition.

Casshern Sins

The series completely discards the continuity presented in the original "Casshan" anime series, in which Casshern was a cybernetic superhero battling the evil robotic forces of Braiking Boss (often mistranslated in English as "Black King Boss"; the name derives from the Japanese 無頼 or "burai", meaning "rogue" or "brute") in a post-apocalyptic Earth.However, one could argue that this series could actually function as a prequel to the original "Casshan" series, as (while not, perhaps, without causing minor plot holes) the events in "Casshern Sins "actually lead to events similar to that of the start of "Casshan". In "Casshern Sins", Casshern is presented as a cyborg subordinate of Braiking Boss who was ordered to assassinate the savior of mankind, and has thus doomed the Earth to ruin. Casshern Sins made its English broadcast premiere on Funimation Channel on December 21, 2010. A manga adaptation is published in Jive's Monthly Comic Rush Magazine.
In the United States, the series began airing on Adult Swim's newly revived Toonami block as part of its premiere on May 26, 2012.
Story.
Created as a reboot of the "Casshern" franchise, "Casshern Sins" tells the story of a world where robots subjugated humanity after becoming self-aware. Their leader, Braiking Boss, ruled over the world with an iron fist. One day, a mysterious girl named Luna is summoned by the people, in order to bring the salvation of mankind. Fearing her as a potential threat, Braiking Boss sent three of his most powerful cyborg warriors to dispose of Luna: Casshern, Dio, and Leda. Casshern, the strongest warrior, manages to track down and kill Luna. However, this triggers a cataclysmic event which sets into motion the end of the world. Hundreds of years later, the world's atmosphere is filled with poison, and, due to the inability of most remaining humans to reproduce, as well as the constant threat posed by the robots, humanity is on the brink of extinction.
Robots fare little better, fearing death as much as humans do: the poisonous environment quickly causes their mechanical bodies to rust and corrode, forcing them to constantly replace their damaged parts, if spare parts in good condition can even be found. In this wretched time and place, Casshern, who had disappeared following the assassination of Luna, returns with no memory of who he is or what he had done. As he embarks on a journey to find out the truth about himself, will Casshern discover his true purpose and destiny?
Media.
Anime.
"Casshern Sins" was first announced at the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2008, where it was announced that Madhouse would be in charge of the animation. Soon after, an official trailer was posted online, on its official Japanese website. It was announced at Otakon 2009 that Funimation Entertainment will produce and distribute the series for release in 2010, following a subtitled-only release on their video service in late 2009.
The show had previously aired on Japan's Chiba TV, TV Aichi, MBS, TV Kanagawa & TV Saitama stations. Casshern Sins had also aired on Singapore's Arts Central channel. According to the Strait Times, the show aired simultaneously with Japan in order to cut down illegal downloading in Singapore. TV5 airs Casshern Sins in the Philippines.
Casshern Sins is distributed in Oceania by Siren Entertainment with an Australian distribution by Gryphon Entertainment and the New Zealand distribution by Vendetta Films. Manga Entertainment distributes Casshern Sins in the United Kingdom.
The series made its North American television debut on December 14, 2010 on the Funimation Channel. Cartoon Network's Adult Swim aired the series as part of the revived Toonami block from May 26, 2012 until November 3, 2012.

Marcelinho Machado

Marcelo "Marcelinho" Magalhães Machado (born 12 April 1975 in Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian professional basketball player with Flamengo in the NBB and the senior men's Brazilian national basketball team.
Professional career.
"The New Oscar Shmidt".
Machado currently plays for the Brazlian club Flamengo. He started his carrer playing for Fluminense, a team from Rio de Janeiro, one of the greatest Flamengo's rivals. He emerged as one of the greatest hopes of Brazilian basketball as a career then idol Oscar Schmidt was ending, mainly due to the similarities of their game, a player who threw a lot of balls three and did many points. He was soon called to the national team to play the 1999 Pan American Games, in Winnipeg, Canada. The Brazilian team won the tournament, after a win over the American team. He went through teams like Botafogo, Tijuca, Ginástico (MG), Corinthians (PR), Rimini Crabs (ITA), Alerta Lobos Cantabria (ESP), Telemar/Rio de Janeiro,with whom Marcelinho won the Campeonato Brasileiro de Basquete, after a final series against Unitri/Uberlândia, which would be his next team, in 2005. After he played fpr Uberlândia, Machado went to Lithuania to defend the main team of the country, Žalgiris Kaunas. He stayed in Lithuania until 2007, when he signed with Flamengo. He just won his third Pan American Games, realized in Rio de Janeiro.
Flamengo (2007–present).
2007–2008 season: Flamengo's first national title.
The arrival of Marcelinho to Flamengo created much expectation around the team, who had never won the Campeonato Brasileiro de Basquete, not even on the Oscar Schmidt Era. Together with Marcelinho, arrived to the team his brother, the guard Duda Machado, the guard Hélio Lima and other important players. 
Machado lead the team to a one-defeat campaign in the regular season. Besides, he scored 46 points in a game, which the record in that season, and made avarages of 24,4 points per game and 2,9 steals per game. Beside Duda, Hélio, the center Fernando Coloneze and the power forward Jefferson William, Marcelinho lead Flamengo to the final, against the champion of the previous season, Brasília, which would become the greatest rival of Flamengo in the national scene.
In the final series, Flamengo won by 3–0 and won its first national title.
2008–2009 season: The First NBB and the first MVP.
On January 28, 2009, it was disputed the first game in NBB's history, between Flamengo and Pinheiros. Marcelinho made a great match, with 36 points in a 90–89 win, in a particular duel with the Pinheiros' forward Marquinhos, his teammate in the Brazil national team.

2012–2013 season: Injured season, Flamengo's second NBB.

Carroll v. United States

Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court which upheld that the warrantless search of an automobile is known as the automobile exception. The case has also been used to increase the scope of warrantless searches.
Background.
Federal prohibition officers arranged an undercover purchase of liquor from George Carroll, an illicit dealer under investigation, but the transaction was not completed. They later saw Carroll and one Kiro driving on the highway from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Michigan, which they regularly patrolled. They gave chase, pulled them over, and searched the car, finding illegal liquor behind the rear seat.
The National Prohibition Act provided that officers could make warrantless searches of vehicles, boats, or airplanes when they had reason to believe illegal liquor was being transported and that law enforced the Eighteenth Amendment.
Opinion of the court.
The Court noted that Congress early obviated the need for a search warrant in border search situations, and Congress always recognized "a necessary difference" between searches of buildings and vehicles "for contraband goods, where it is not practical to secure a warrant, because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought." The warrantless search under these circumstances was thus valid.
The Court held, however, that
The Court added that "where the securing of a warrant is reasonably practicable, it must be used."
This became known as the "Carroll" doctrine: a vehicle could be searched without a search warrant if there was probable cause to believe that evidence is present in the vehicle, coupled with exigent circumstances to believe that the vehicle could be removed from the area before a warrant could be obtained.
Subsequent events.
In "United States v. Di Re", the Court declined to extend "Carroll" to permit searches of passengers in a vehicle which had apparently been lawfully stopped. In "Di Re" there was no probable cause to believe that the passenger was holding any evidence.
The Court relied on "Carroll" in "Cooper v. California" to observe that a search of a vehicle may be reasonable where the same search of a dwelling may not be reasonable.
Due to a 2009 decision rendered by the Supreme Court in "Arizona v. Gant", there may be new restrictions on warrantless searches of automobiles under certain limited circumstances. That ruling requires either that the vehicle's owner has a reasonable chance of moving the vehicle before police can get a warrant. In the case of Gant, the suspect was arrested while the vehicle was parked. "Arizona v. Gant" does not automatically preclude "Carroll" and does not repeal it.

Japhet and Happy

Japhet and Happy was a British newspaper cartoon strip originally appeared as 'The Adventures of the Noah Family' initially in the Daily News during 1919 and transferred in 1930 to the News Chronicle. It was originated and drawn by J. F. Horrabin, James Francis Horrabin (1884–1962) who was a British journalist, cartoonist and cartographer, and he was elected Labour Member of Parliament for Peterborough from 1929-1931. He wrote Political books as well as the 'Dot and Carrie' strip for the Star that ran from 1922 to 1964. The Noah Family names are based on religious names, but the cartoon strips have no religious theme.
Characters.
The main "Noah Family" characters initially were Japhet, a boy, his brothers Shem & Ham, their parents Mr & Mrs Noah. Selina and Matilda were their cousins who lived with them together with Fido the dog. They all lived in a house on Ararat Avenue in South West London, as mentioned on the 1924 book.
The human Noah Family characters were styled like wooden puppets with human faces but without elbow or knee joints or fingers. The styling changed in the early years from very skinny and stick-like bodies to the more familiar rounded figures as seen by 1924. An early-introduced character was an elderly gentleman, Mr Cheery, who helped Japhet when he was lost in an early story. His adopted son, Tim Tosset featured in the earlier strips but had left by the time Happy was introduced in c1926-27. Happy was a small fat bear that never spoke, unlike other cartoon animals. Later additions included Oswald the tortoise who had a liking for hiding. Jerry was their odd-job handyman who was an ex-sailor & dressed similarly. Adelaide was an Ostrich, Archibald (Archie) was a donkey and Gerald was a goat. Their garden later had a Golobosh Tree brought from a trip visiting the Panjandrum. By the time of a 1950s annual, Cracky the dog & Pukky, a parrot-type bird, were added. Despite the Noah characters names, there was no actual religious theme to the series.
The cartoon strips included a whimsical take on everyday life and misunderstandings through the eyes of Japhet including scenes at school and appearing in a Circus. In later annuals from the mid-1930s visits were made to an imaginary African country 'Andamalumbo' where they met "His Highness the Grand Panjandrum of Andamalumbo, Lord of the Golden Umbrella, Eater of the Purple Goloboshes, and wearer of the Top Hat" (as quoted from the 1933 Annual). The Panjandrum could speak no English, but an invented phrase he used as "Welcome" was "Wamblety Oola". In later stories The Panjandrum and his friend Bom would visit the Noah's in England. Also see Panjandrum for a later use of this Samuel Foote invented word, probably influenced by its popularised pre-War usage in the 'Japhet and Happy' strips.
The Arkubs.
As with other annuals, such as Teddy Tail with the Teddy Tail League, Pip, Squeak and Wilfred with the WLOG and Bobby Bear with the Bobby Bear Club, Japhet and Happy also had a club in the mid-1930s, The Arkubs. The club had a badge, with Happy and AK on it. There were secret codes, hand signs and rules for "The Grand United Order of Arkubs". To join the Arkubs, if you were under 15, you had to collect 12 'Happy' Badges from the 'News Chronicle' and send off three pence. You could also get a 'Japhet and Happy' breakfast set of a cup, saucer, plate and egg cup by enrolling 6 new members.
Annuals.
The first book published containing their stories was the 1920 Cassell & Co small format hardback "Some Adventures of the Noah Family including Japhet". A large format paperback book "The Japhet Book" from 1924 (date found from an advert at the back) features 120 cartoon strip reprints. Later Hardback annuals followed with non-annual type titles in 1926 "About Japhet & The Rest Of The Noah Family"; 1927 "Japhet & Co. Including Happy"; 1928 "Japhet & The Arkubs"; 1929 "Japhet & The Arkubs At Sea"; 1930 "Japhet & Co. On Arkub Island". 1931 had the Japhet & Happy Book. The yearly dated "Japhet and Happy Annual" appeared from 1932 to 1939 (though dated for the following year as typical with Annuals). They featured newspaper reprints and added stories. During the war they changed in format. The 1940 annual was undated, but portrait style, like those that preceded it. In 1941 the annual switched to landscape. From 1942 they slimmed considerably, perhaps due to paper shortages. In style they became reprinted cartoon strips with songsheets at the end, having dropped the longer stories. After the war from 1946 to circa 1951 they continued as undated annuals, mostly in the smaller landscape style, but with two in a larger format in similar size to the 1924 one. For book collectors, the hardback annuals 1926 to 1934 were of a smaller size than the later hardback ones. The slim landscape format hardback books are from 1941 onwards.
Also issued were at least 3 'Holiday Annuals', 'The Noahs on Holiday with Japhet', 'The Japhet Holiday Book' and 'The Japhet and Happy Holiday Book'.

Ger McDonnell

Gerard McDonnell (20 January 1971 – 2 August 2008), mountaineer and engineer, was the first Irish person to reach the summit of K2, the second-highest mountain on Earth, in August 2008. He lost his life along with ten other mountaineers following an avalanche on the descent, in the worst single accident in the history of K2 mountaineering.
McDonnell was born in Kilcornan, County Limerick. A decade before his K2 success, he had moved to Anchorage, Alaska. He hoped not only to work there but also to develop his skills as a mountaineer. McDonnell was well known in Anchorage's Irish community. Among his interests was playing the bodhrán in a band. He was described as a "philosopher" and a "great storyteller". McDonnell summited Mount Everest with Mick Murphy in 2003. He was unsuccessful during an earlier attempt on K2 in 2006 when he was hit by a rock and airlifted to hospital. Irish President, Mary McAleese was among the dignitaries to pay tribute to him following his successful Everest climb in 2003 and in 2008 following his death.
McDonnell's group had been on a mammoth expedition for eight weeks, surviving in sub-zero temperatures. In an online despatch, he said that after the team set 31 July as their date for the summit bid, spirits were high. "Let luck and good fortune prevail, fingers crossed," he wrote. However, following the avalanche, a serac fell, cutting all the fixed lines on his and his fellow members of the Dutch-led Norit K2 Expedition's path.
It was said by the surviving members of McDonnell's team that he refused to descend because he was helping the others that were injured. Expedition leader Wilco van Rooijen, a 40-year-old Dutch climber who was airlifted to a military hospital in Pakistan after surviving the accident, said that poor preparations had contributed to the disaster. He suggested that advance climbers laid ropes in the wrong places on the mountain, hampering the climb of several teams of mountaineers and ultimately contributing to deaths of three of the climbers on his team. "Everything was going well to camp four, and on summit attempt, everything went wrong," said van Rooijen from his hospital bed in the Northern Pakistani town of Skardu. "The biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements. Everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised. With such stupid things, lives are endangered." He singled out another team for only bringing half the length of rope they were supposed to. Ger McDonnell's satellite phone was given to Pemba on the summit and he brought it along with McDonnell's camera back to base camp. Mr McDonnell's partner, brother JJ and sister Denise flew to Islamabad in search of answers. Whilst McDonnell's body was not recovered, a memorial service was held in Kilcornan on 17 August 2008.
McDonnell's mother, brother, partner, van Rooijen and Pat Falvey later appeared on "The Late Late Show" on 3 October 2008. In 2009, a memorial fund was set up in his honour to provide first-aid training and safe climbing technique for high-altitude porters.
In 2012, Damien O'Brien (married to McDonnell's sister Denise), wrote a book about McDonnell, "The Time Has Come: Ger McDonnell – His Life & Death on K2", published by The Collins Press. The book was launched in McDonnell's hometown of Kilcornan, County Limerick, on Friday 30 March with most of the town in attendance. Mike Barry, the first Irish person to walk to the South Pole, officially launched the book while others in attendance included Clare O'Leary, Wilco van Rooijen, Cas van der Gevel and Maarten van Eck.

Lines of Weissenburg

The Lines of Weissenburg or Lines of Wissembourg, entrenched works — an earthen rampart dotted with small outworks — along the river Lauter.
History.
The Lines, which were in length and stretched from Wissembourg on the west to Lauterbourg on the east, where they were anchored on the Rhine River. The French built this chain of fortifications during the War of the Spanish Succession under the orders of the Duke of Villars in 1706. 
During the War of the Austrian Succession the loss of the Lines by the French played a pivotal role in the campaign of 1744. French King Louis XV in command of an army of 90,000 captured Menen and Ypres and prepared to invade the Austrian Netherlands. He was forced to abandon his invasion plans when Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, assisted by the veteran Otto Traun, skillfully manoeuvred his army over the Rhine near Philippsburg on July 1, and captured the Lines of Wissembourg. This move cut off an army under Louis, Prince de Conti from Alsace. Although Conti managed to fight his way through the enemy at Wissembourg and posted himself near Strasbourg, Louis XV abandoned the invasion of the Southern Netherlands, and his army moved down to take a decisive part in the war in Alsace and Lorraine.
The Lines were still militarily and strategically significant during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Lines were stormed on 13 October 1793 by an allied army under Austrian General Dagobert von Wurmser in the First Battle of Wissembourg. The allies were in their turn dispossessed by Lazare Hoche and Charles Pichegru in a second Battle of Wissembourg on 26 December and forced to retreat behind the Rhine.
In 1815, after the Battle of Waterloo, the Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine advanced into France. On 25 June the Crown Prince of Württemberg, commander of the Austrian III Corps, advanced towards the Lines in two columns. The first column assembled at Bergzabern, and the second moved forward by Nieder Ottersbach. Count Wallmoden was directed to advance upon Lauterburg. The Crown Prince advanced his Corps still further along the Hagenau road. His advanced guard pushed on to Inglesheim, and the main body of the III Corps reached the Lines. The French under General Jean Rapp abandoned the Lines in the night and fell back upon the Forest of Hagenau, occupying the large village of Surburg.
By 1870 the Lines no longer existed, but the two central forts in the towns of Wissembourg and Altenstadt, still possessed fortifications that proved useful defensive positions during the Battle of Wissembourg. On August 4, 1870 the Germans under the Crown Prince of Prussia, afterwards the emperor Frederick III, gained the first victory of the war over a French corps (part of the army commanded by Patrice de MacMahon) under General Abel Douay, who was killed early in the engagement.

Valuative criterion

In mathematics, specifically algebraic geometry, the valuative criteria are a collection of results that make it possible to decide whether a morphism of algebraic varieties, or more generally schemes, is universally closed, separated, or proper.
Statement of the valuative criteria.
Recall that a valuation ring A is a domain, so if "K" is the field of fractions of "A", then Spec "K" is the generic point of Spec "A". 
Let "X" and "Y" be schemes, and let "f" : "X" → "Y" be a morphism of schemes. Then the following are equivalent:
The lifting condition is equivalent to specifying that the natural morphism
is injective (resp. surjective, resp. bijective).

Folklore of the Bua Kanwari.
Name of Kanwari village is after the 'Bua Kanwari' i.e. Paternal Aunt who is virgin. Bua means paternal aunt and Kumari means virgin girl which is pronounced as kunwari or kanwari on the local Haryanvi dialect of the Hindi language. Bua Kanwari was a daughter of this village.
As per stories passed down by generations, she went out with her domestic animals to take them out in the fields for a feed, when she was returning, she heard that two marriage parties have arrived to marry her (due to some unknown confusion). She was so ashamed of this that she prayed to god to be turned into stone, she started to turn into stone starting from her feet. One of the groom rushed to her on horse and her upper torso was still flesh while her lower body had already turned into stone. Groom quickly used his sword to cut her body in half and took her upper (still in flesh) with him.
This temple now has an ancient statue of lower portion (below torso) of Bua Kumari. Recently villagers have renovated this temple, during renovation they dug up to several feet and found many broken statues. These are now kept underneath the new chamber for main deity/statue.
Bua Kanwari is very prominent and she is so revered that every groom from this village will go and pray during Nikasi which is a Hindu wedding ceremony where groom from village goes and prays to village/family deity before leaving with marriage party to proceed to bride's village. Similarly when he returns to village with his bride, both will go to Bua Kanwari's temple to seek blessings. During this ceremony, bride will bring clay (mitti) seven times from nearby Johad and put it on a mound next to the temple.

Post Properties

Post Properties, Inc. (NYSE: PPS) is a developer and operator of multifamily communities, including resort-style garden apartments and high-density urban apartments. Operating as a real estate investment trust (REIT), the company also develops condominiums and converts existing apartments into condominiums.
Post Properties is headquartered in Atlanta, and has operations in nine markets across the country. The company employs approximately 600 people and owns approximately 20,000 apartment homes.
History.
Post Properties was founded in Atlanta in 1971 by John A. Williams and Douglas Bates, and initially developed and managed primarily garden-style apartments. In the late 1980s, Post shifted its focus from garden apartments and began to also explore urban "in-fill locations,” areas in once-vacant urban centers that were beginning to become residential again. In the 1990s, the company also began developing mixed-use properties, combining residential units, retail and, sometimes, office space. 
Post became a public company in the summer of 1993, with its initial public offering (IPO) priced at $25.50 per share. In August 1997, Post announced a merger with Columbus Realty Trust. The $600 million company based in Dallas, Texas expanded Post's holdings by more than a third, from just over 21,000 units to more than 29,000. 
Since 2000, Post has balanced its portfolio with garden, mixed-use and urban apartment communities as well as condominium developments. To achieve this balance, the company has sold some of its assets, entered into joint ventures on development projects, and made acquisitions in other key markets.
John Williams left the company in 2004. Today, Post Properties is led by David P. Stockert, who joined the company in 2001 and serves as its president and CEO.
Post HOPE Foundation.
The Post HOPE Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that functions as the employee giving and charitable distribution arm of Post. It is responsible for facilitating employee service projects, coordinating employee giving programs and assisting with employee fundraising efforts.
Green Initiatives.
In 2008, Post launched its green initiative Post EcoActiveTM. The EcoActive program received a Green Services Award from Multi-Housing News, recognizing Post's commitment to conserving natural resources. The award highlighted the Post EcoActive recycling program in particular. Recycling centers are available in all Post markets for residents to recycle everything from newspaper to glass, aluminum, steel and plastic. Nationally, Post's Recycling Centers collect 840 tons of newspaper, glass and aluminum on a national basis. All carpet is recyclable and collected at the end of its life rather than taken to the landfill.

Hell's Kitchen (band)

Hell's Kitchen was a rock group formed in 1987 when Guitarist Luke Skeels decided to leave Boneless Ones due to conflict with the singer. When the other members heard the news, they too left en masse, and Hell's Kitchen was born. The band recruited members of Verbal Abuse and Fang, for the first lineup. The band was known for its expert musicianship and total irreverence for the music scene in general, and Heavy Metal in particular. Their attitude was "shows should be fun".
After various line-up changes, the band's first release featured: Luke Skeels (guitar), Sean Condon (vocals), Troy Takaki (bass), Mike Branum (drums). Condon was later replaced by Jimi Hayes.
Their songs, performed in a mock-speed-metal/punk style, include such topics as beer, satan, chicken and The Grateful Dead.
Hell's Kitchen has released two full-length albums as well as appearing on an episode of "HBO's Tales from the Crypt".
The band toured Europe twice in 1990, covering most, if not all, of Western Europe as well as parts of Scandinavia, and a few Eastern Block countries as well. Shows were played with German punk bands such as Spermbirds and Militant Mothers.
In 2012 Luke Skeels announced that Hell's Kitchen was re-forming and asked Oakland rapper Eastbay Slick to assume the role of vocalist for future performances.

Reserve study

A reserve study is a budget planning tool which identifies the current status of the reserve fund and a stable and equitable funding plan to offset ongoing deterioration, resulting in sufficient funds when those anticipated major common area expenditures actually occur. The reserve study consists of two parts: the physical analysis and the financial analysis. This document is often prepared by an outside independent consultant for the benefit of administrators (Board of Directors or Strata Council Members) of a property with multiple owners, such as a condominium association or homeowners' association (HOA), strata, containing an assessment of the state of the commonly owned property components as determined by the particular association's CC&Rs and bylaws. Reserve studies however are not limited only to condominiums and can be created for other properties such as resort (shared vacation ownership) properties, apartment buildings, worship facilities, private schools, private (golf/social) clubs, and office parks.
Reserve studies are in essence planning tools designed to help the board anticipate, and prepare for, the property's major repair and replacement projects. For example, such projects would include: replacement of the roof on the building(s), replacement of the boiler, retrofit of the fire alarm devices, and resurfacing of the roadways.
In some jurisdictions across Canada, a reserve study is also sometimes referred to as a "reserve fund study", "contingency reserve fund study", or "replacement reserve study" and, in British Columbia, the legislation refers to this type of study as a "Depreciation Report".
Purpose.
The purpose of a reserve study is to give those overseeing the maintenance of the property a better idea of what major expenses to expect and an educated estimate of when these expenses will occur. With this knowledge, the homeowners' association board or manager can create a budget so association members will make their fair share of reserve contributions, designed to offset the slow but steady ongoing reserve component deterioration of the association assets, and avoid being surprised by components that deteriorated often in plain sight and over a number of years. In addition, the reserve study provides important annual disclosures to association members (and prospective buyers) about the condition of common area components, and the level of preparedness (strength) of the reserve fund (typically measured in terms of Percent funded). A reserve study is a roadmap that allows decisions to be made which will be efficient and effective for the long term.
Results.
There are three results from a reserve study:
Relevance.
Reserve studies are required by the board or manager for due diligence, disclosure, and budget and planning purposes. An increasing number of U.S. states and Canadian provinces today require some form of reserve planning or disclosures. In addition to requiring a minimum 10% of the total budget be dedicated to reserve contributions, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration may ask for a current reserve studies (to demonstrate that the association has dedicated sufficient funds to caring for the ongoing needs of the property) to be approved for FHA insured loans and Fannie Mae lending products and services.
State reserve studies.
In addition to being helpful planning tools, reserve studies for Community Associations are legally mandated in 30 states (such as California, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Virginia, Washington, etc.), either for budget preparation or homeowner (and prospective homeowner) disclosure purposes. In California, the relevant law is California Civil Code 5300. In California, the law requires an annual reserve study Update, with that update prepared on the basis of a "diligent visual site inspection" at least every third year. With the passing of SB 278 in 2010, the state of Utah also requires condominium and community associations to conduct and review reserve studies on a periodic basis. reserve contributions are often one of an association's largest budget line items (often 15-40% of the total budget), and the reserve fund is typically the association's largest financial asset. This means annual review of reserve contributions and annual disclosure of the status of the reserve fund are prudent.
US FHA.
On June 30, 2011, the Department of Housing and Urban Development published Mortgagee Letter 2011-22, which made reserve studies mandatory for all new condominium conversions applying for FHA insured loans approval, including gut and non-gut rehabilitation conversions. This new guideline went into effect September 1, 2011. Condominiums must demonstrate that at least 10% of the yearly assessment income be dedicated towards reserve contributions. The FHA enforces the 10% budget line item requirement nationally by prohibiting lending in developments that are non-compliant with this requirement. Additionally, Mortgagee Letter 2011-22 stipulates all other condominiums requesting FHA project approval may be required to submit a current (completed within the last 24 months) reserve study at their discretion or whenever financial documents do not appear to meet sufficient funding requirements of the condominium association.
Fannie Mae.
On December 1, 2010, Fannie Mae published Announcement SEL 2010-16. The new guidelines outlined in the announcement went into effect March 1, 2011. The guidelines made reserve studies mandatory for all newly converted, non-gut rehabilitation condominium developments to be eligible Fannie Mae project approval. All other types of condominiums have the option to submit a compliant reserve study or must add a budget line item for reserves equal to 10% of the yearly assessment income.
In Canada.
In Canada the governing legislation is provincial and there are no national regulatory standards other than those enforced by national firms or associations. The intent of the various Acts are open to interpretation and as such differing opinions exist with respect to "adequate" funding. These differing opinions not only vary among planners they also vary among owners and managers. To date there are no statutory or mandatory funding requirements and as such unit owners are free to determine the level of funding which they consider to be adequate. The function of the reserve fund planner is to provide advice to the Board of Directors/Council Members who then need to sell the owners on the proposed plan. The owners will ultimately decide what level of contribution meets their objectives whether that be conservative or aggressive. The favorability of either approach will ultimately be determined by the market place and reflected in property values. Some owners will opt to purchase in properties which may have higher fees however retain higher level of reserves while other may elect to enjoy lower fees and accept a higher risk of a special assessment. These owners would rather control their own funds/investments rather than leave them in the hands of a few owners. Other factors include how the property is viewed by mortgage insurers such as C.M.H.C. and Genworth Canada It is important for decision makers to educate themselves on the methodologies utilized by the various planner designations and practices.
Funding methods and objectives.
There are several reserve study funding methods and goals. These methods may be used to develop a funding strategy that corresponds with the risk tolerance of the community. In National reserve study Standards terminology, there are two basic funding Methods: "Cash Flow" or "Straight Line". Straight Line Funding models utilize a methodology in which funds are allocated to specific components, often not modeling the real world function of the reserve fund (where all Reserve Funds are available to be spent on all legitimate Reserve projects).
In the same National reserve study Standard terminology, there are four funding objectives: Full funding, threshold funding, baseline funding, and statutory funding. Due to its greater computational flexibility and its ability to allow the user to focus on and achieve any of the four funding Objectives, the "Cash Flow" Method has seen significant growth in popularity.
"Full funding" describes the objective to have reserves on hand equivalent to the value of the deterioration of the each reserve component. For example, for a $10,000 (current cost) pool resurface project with a useful life of ten years, after two years, when the pool's surface has deteriorated 2/10 of $10,000, to be fully funded the association should have $2000 set aside for this component (and on and on again for each component). "Full funding" describes an objective where ongoing deterioration is offset by the proportional accumulation of cash.
"Baseline funding" describes the objective to have sufficient reserves on hand to never completely run out of money. This is sometimes described as a "cash-positive" plan. With less cash in reserves on-deposit, associations with a baseline funding objective have higher instances of special assessments and/or deferred maintenance.
"Threshold funding" describes an objective chosen by the board other than the 100% (full funding) level or just staying cash-positive (baseline funding). This may be a specific percent funded target or a cash balance target. Threshold funding is often a value chosen in between full funding and baseline funding.
"Statutory funding" describes the pursuit of an objective as described or required by local laws or codes.
All funding objectives are designed to meet exactly the same expenses outlined in the reserve component list. Thus the expenditures are identical, only the size of the reserve fund through the years is different. This means the size of reserve contributions between different reserve funding objectives is relatively small (typically only 10–15%).
Qualifications & Levels of Service.
Reserve studies can be created by volunteer board members, their professional managers, obtained through a variety of professionals specializing in the preparation of reserve studies, or large architectural or engineering firms who complete reserve studies as a small aspect of their larger business. Recently, certification criteria have been created to allow for a more ordered system of identifying those individuals who have been specifically trained in the creation of reserve studies. One such certification, that of reserve Specialist (RS), is available through the Community Associations Institute (CAI). To obtain this certification, candidates must have prepared at least 30 reserve studies within the past 3 calendar years, hold a bachelors degree in construction management, architecture, or engineering (or something equivalent based on experience and education), and complied with various other rules and codes of conducts.
Another credential is the Professional Reserve Analyst (PRA), created and promoted by the reserve study industry's own trade organization, the Association of Professional reserve Analysts (APRA). The PRA was the first accrediting body for Reserve Professionals. The PRA credential is similar in that it takes years, demonstrated experience, and compliance with standardized terminology to obtain although the experience levels are a bit higher than that required for the RS and their efforts include studies both inside and outside of the CID industry. APRA also requires its PRA's to maintain proficiency with continuing education.
In Canada there are several designations and training programs. The Real Estate Institute of Canada (REIC) offers the Certified Reserve Planner (CRP) program, which is the only nationally accepted specialty designation listed in provincial legislation as qualified. Members of the Appraisal Institute of Canada (AIC) must use the methodology and standards of the REIC program if they wish to complete the report. The Canadian National Association of Real Estate Appraisers (CNAREA, based in Qualicum Beach (Vancouver Island), started to offer the Designated Reserve Planner (DRP) program to designated appraiser members since 2012. The PRFA and the DRP designations require demonstrated experience and compliance with standardized terminology and methodology to obtain. All PRFA and DRP designated planners are required to use the RFA Pro Reserve Fund Analysis software or provide a quality assurance report of their chosen calculation methods. Applied Science Technologists & Technicians of British Columbia (ASTTBC) offers the Registered Reserve Fund Analysts (RRFA) training program to Home inspectors, as home inspectors are restricted from completing Depreciation Reports / Reserve Studies in their bylaws. As of 2013, Sauder School of Business Real Estate Division is offering the first of 2 courses towards a certification called the Reserve Fund Planning Program (RFPP), but yet no trade group has recognized this designation. All CRP, DRP and PRFA reserve fund planners are required to carry $2,000,000 in E & O Insurance coverage.
There are three types of reserve studies based on standards set by the Association of Professional Reserve Analysts and Community Associations Institute, differing in how exhaustively the Physical Analysis is conducted. These three types of reserve studies allow the association to select the "Level of Service" appropriate to their current budget preparation and disclosure needs. Listed beginning with the most exhaustive, they are:

Postage stamps and postal history of Vietnam

The postage stamps of Vietnam were issued by a variety of states and administrations. Stamps were first introduced by the French colonial administration. Stamps specifically for Vietnam were first issued in 1945. During the decades of conflict and partitioning, stamps were issued by mutually hostile governments. The reunification of Vietnam in 1976 brought about a unified postal service.
Advent of Vietnamese stamps.
Stamps in Vietnam were first introduced by the French colonial administration in 1862. The stamps of these decades were initially of the general French colonial series. In the 1880s, some of these were overprinted locally for Cochinchina (1886–88), Annam and Tonkin (1888) and French Indochina (1889). Subsequently, definitive stamps of French Indochina were issued. The colony of French Indochina consisted of present-day Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Stamps specifically for Vietnam were first issued in 1945.
During the Japanese occupation of French Indochina (1940-1945), the colonial administration did not receive fresh supplies of stamps from France. For this reason they resorted to printing their own stamps at a print shop in Hanoi. These stamps were of lower quality than the pre-war stamps, and in addition, the machinery used for this purpose gradually deteriorated, with limited possibilities of repairing it.
The advent of stamps specifically for Vietnam came with the defeat of Japan in 1945. In Vietnam, the Japanese surrender paved the way for the anti-Japanese Viet Minh movement, which presided over a guerilla army, to seize key cities and political power in Vietnam. During 1945-1946, the Viet Minh government issued a large number of provisional postage stamps. These stamps were manufactured by adding an overprint to remaining stocks of the war-era stamps of French Indochina. Eventually, a set of definitive stamps depicting Ho Chi Minh were issued in 1946.
The ensuing conflict between the returning French troops and the Viet Minh government brought an end to the initial series of Viet Minh stamps. During the conflict, stamps were issued in various Viet Minh held regions, while new issues of French Indochina stamps were used in areas controlled by the French. Around 1950, national governments for Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were established, each issuing stamps and coins in their own names. The first stamps of the Bảo Đại government in Vietnam were issued in 1951. These stamps supplanted the French Indochina stamps in the French controlled areas of Vietnam.
With the peace agreement in 1954, Vietnam was partitioned into a Northern and a Southern state. Each issued their own stamps.
North Vietnam (1954-1976).
Many stamps of North Vietnam were printed in Hanoi, while others were printed abroad, e.g. in Prague, Czechoslovakia, (1958–59) and subsequently in Budapest, Hungary.
South Vietnam (1954-1976).
The stamps of South Vietnam were mostly printed in Paris, Tokyo, England (by De La Rue) and Rome during 1954-67, in Japan during 1967-73 and in England (by De La Rue) during 1973-75.
Stamps used by military personnel were printed locally and are of inferior quality.
Between 1963 and 1976, the insurgent National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (the NLF or "Viet Cong") issued their own stamps. These were printed in Hanoi. When the Republic of Vietnam was toppled in May 1975, the NFL government became the sole stamp issuing authority, until the reunification of Vietnam one year later.
Reunified Vietnam (1976-).
The reunification of Vietnam in July 1976 brought about a unified postal service. This effectively consisted of the postal administration in Hanoi operating throughout Vietnam. Indeed, the stamps issued in July and August 1976 still had the name of the North Vietnamese state printed on them, while later issues have simply "Việt Nam" and "bưu chính" (mail). As in North Vietnam, post-reunification stamps were partly printed in Vietnam and partly abroad. Domestically printed stamps were printed in Hanoi 1976-1987 and subsequently in Saigon. During 1983-1990 most stamp issues were printed in Havana, Cuba, these were of a superior printing quality. Eventually, the postal service acquired improved technology from Germany. Since 1990 all stamps of Vietnam have been produced domestically.
Relations with the collector market.
Many stamp sets of North Vietnam and post-reunification Vietnam are available imperforate, as opposed to the regular perforated versions. This goes for stamps printed domestically and abroad. At present, Vietnamese stamps are officially offered in both regular, imperforate and specimen versions. The imperforate and specimen versions serve no postal purpose and are thus entirely aimed at the collector community.
During the war of independence (1946-1954) and immediate aftermath, some stamps were issued imperforate due to technical shortcomings. These may, of course, have inspired later collector oriented imperforates.
Apart from the regular issues (for postal use), a large proportion of the stamps of Vietnam have been made available to collectors as cancelled-to-order (CTO) versions. The Havana printed stamps of the 1980s usually have the CTO cancellation printed directly onto the stamp along with the rest of the design and are solely aimed at the collector community. While the majority of the stamps of this category found in the collector market are CTO versions, this should not overshadow the fact that similar stamps (non-CTO editions) are found postally used.
While a large proportion of the stamps of the 1980s appear to deliberately appeal to thematic collectors (cars, dogs, cats, etc.), 21st century stamps are broader in scope, and the issue rate has declined. This seems to reflect a shift in issuing policy away from the orientation towards thematic collectors, thus making the field of Vietnamese stamps more appealing in its own right.

<doc id="18829916" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18829916" title="Indianist movement">
Indianist movement

The Indianist movement was a movement in American classical music that flourished from the 1880s until the 1920s. It was based on attempts to synthesize American Indian musical ideas with some of the basic principles of Western music. Chief practitioners of the form included Charles Sanford Skilton, Arthur Nevin, Arthur Farwell, and Charles Wakefield Cadman; many other composers were also involved in the craze at various points throughout their careers. In his book "Imagining Native America in Music" Michael Pisani argues that there was no such thing as an "Indianist" movement in American music, but that American composers' borrowing melodies of native America (beginning around 1890) was simply one part of a larger interest in the use of folk musics of all ethnicities on American soil. (A similar interest can be found in the work of several classical composers of Central and South America at this time as well.)
Origins.
The Indianist movement could trace its roots to certain trends in nineteenth-century American Romanticism, although its musical roots go back much earlier; examples of music on "Indian" themes can be found dating back to the early years of the seventeenth century, and stories relating to the conquest of the Americas were popular with composers through the late eighteenth century as well. It bears many similarities with the cult of the noble savage, espoused by writers such as James Fenimore Cooper and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Edwin Forrest, too, influenced the movement with his star performance in the play "Metamora". At least one composer, Anthony Philip Heinrich, a contemporary of these artists, is recorded as having spent some time among the Indians on the American frontiers; he was also the first to set Longfellow's "Hiawatha" to music. He did not, however, use Indian musical themes in his work. 
Beginnings of the movement.
With the rise in studies both in ethnology and in folklore later in the nineteenth century, much information was gleaned and collected about various American Indian cultures. In 1880 Theodore Baker transcribed songs from a number of tribes, publishing them two years later in a German-language dissertation for his doctorate from the University of Leipzig. Edward MacDowell borrowed themes from Baker's work when composing his "Second (Indian) Suite" for orchestra in 1894. Further impetus came with the arrival, in 1892, of Antonín Dvořák to teach in New York City. He exhorted American composers to stop imitating European models, and to turn instead to indigenous sources. Composer Frederick Burton took the idea to heart, and transcribed some Ojibway melodies which he later turned into art songs. Later work by ethnographers and musicologists helped to build a body of notated music by Indians, and this aided some composers in searching for musical sources. Some, such as Carlos Troyer, notated their source material themselves in an attempt to be as authentic as possible. Others, such as Harvey Worthington Loomis, borrowed from already-published sources. Charles Sanford Skilton was probably the composer who did most to establish the stereotypes of the genre, with pieces such as his "Suite Primeval" for orchestra.
Opera composers, too, attempted to use Indian themes in their work; among Indianist operas were "Poia", by Arthur Nevin; Victor Herbert's "Natoma"; "Kalopin" and "The Sun Bride" by Charles Skilton; Alberto Bimboni's "Winona"; and "Shanewis", by Charles Wakefield Cadman, the only one of the group to have any measure of success. Even so, both Bimboni and Skilton were awarded the Bispham Memorial Medal Award for their operas.
Arthur Farwell.
Arthur Farwell was perhaps the most important composer involved in the Indianist movement at the height of its influence. He professed interest in all forms of American music, "notably, ragtime, Negro songs, Indian songs, Cowboy songs, and, of the utmost importance, new and daring expressions of our own composers, sound-speech previously unheard." He seemed, however, to show particular interest in American Indian music. Farwell was also the founder of the Wa-Wan Press, which did much to further the cause of Indianist music in America. As a composer, he chose not to view American Indian music as a novelty, viewing it instead as a profound source of inspiration for his work.
Decline.
The Wa-Wan Press began losing subscribers around 1908, and folded in 1912 after being acquired by G. Schirmer. This coupled with the growing influence of jazz and popular music, and a lack of interest in Romanticism, to spell the end of the formal Indianist movement in music. Nevertheless, Indian subjects have continued to interest composers, both in the United States and abroad, through the end of the twentieth century and beyond.
Indianist composers.
Among the major Indianist composers were:
Composers who wrote works based on Indian themes, and who are sometimes grouped under the "Indianist" label, include:

Julian Kelly

Julian James Kelly (born 6 September 1989) is an English footballer who plays as a defender.
Club career.
Born in London, Kelly was with Arsenal until the age of 16 when he joined Reading and became a scholar with the club in June 2006. He finished the 2007–08 season with 27 appearances in the Reading reserves, playing in the position of left back. He featured for Reading on the bench in their opening game of the 2008–09 season, which they drew 0 – 0 with Nottingham Forest. He made his debut for Reading in the League Cup against Dagenham & Redbridge. He then made his league debut against Plymouth Argyle, playing in the right wing. On 21 January 2009, Reading manager Steve Coppell confirmed that his most likely replacement for the suspended Liam Rosenior against Wolverhampton Wanderers would be Kelly. He joined Wycombe Wanderers on an initial one-month emergency loan on 15 February 2010. On his debut for Wycombe Wanderers he scored from a cross for a 1–0 win over Millwall.
In January 2011 Kelly joined Lincoln City on loan making his debut on 15 January in a 2–1 home defeat by Wycombe Wanderers.
On 1 June 2011, he signed a two-year contract with Notts County. Kelly scored his first goal for Notts, a thunderous volley, in 3 – 2 win over Tranmere Rovers. Similarly in 3–2 win against Scunthorpe United Kelly scored the winning the goal after an incisive pass from teammate Gavin Mahon. Kelly became a permanent fixture in Martin Allen's defence as Notts County climbed into the play-off positions midway through the season.

Robin Deacon

Robin Deacon (born 1973 Eastbourne, England) is an artist, writer and filmmaker currently based in the USA. Working since the early 1990s, much of his work encompasses live performance with a series of performed lectures that have explored journalistic and documentary approaches to arts practice. His work is characterised by a humorous and often satirical approach to the subject matter. 
His performances and videos have been presented in the UK and internationally in venues such as The ICA, London (1996), The Young Vic, London (2000), CCCB, Barcelona (2006), Tanzquartier Wein, Vienna (2007) and the Centre d'art Scenique Contemporain Lausanne, Switzerland (2009). He has also been artist in residence at Sophiensaele in Berlin (2005), Camden Arts Centre London (2006) and Robert Wilson's Watermill Center, New York, USA (2009). He become known for his works in political biography, with a series of performances on the lives of former US Secretary of State Colin Powell (2004 – 08) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (2005). These works have a strong multimedia element and are often rewritten in response to prevailing news events regarding their subject. The use of recorded interviews (some recorded covertly) is a key element of these and later performances. His later performance piece Prototypes (2006 – 09) stylistically referenced the output of documentary films produced by the British Transport Commission. Between 2011 and 2013, two new lecture based performances (The Argument Against the Body and White Balance) were presented.
Current projects include a documentary film on the life of late US American performance artist Stuart Sherman, currently which saw its first screening in 2013 as part of the 'Rituals of Rented Island' Exhibition at the Whitney, New York. Parallel to this film have been a series of live re-enactment of Sherman's performances, including his ensemble version of Hamlet (A portrait), shown as part of the Sacred: US Radical season at London's Chelsea Theatre in 2009. He is Assistant Professor in Performance at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

10.5 cm kanon m/34

The 10.5 cm kanon m/34 was a heavy field gun produced in Sweden.
Design.
Designed for motor towing with steel spoked wheels with rubber rims, the m/34 was a development of the earlier 10.5 cm Cannon Model 1927, with the carriage being used by various Bofors 15 cm howitzers of the 1930s. Like most contemporary field artillery the barrels muzzle had a pepper-pot style muzzle brake to reduce recoil.
Four were purchased for the Swedish coastal artillery, fifty-six by the Swedish Army as the 10.5 cm Fältkanon m/34, and an additional order for eight m/34s was produced in 1942. Coastal artillery m/34s were transferred to the field artillery in 1942 under the designation of 10.5 cm Fältkanon m/34M.
Exports.
The m/34 enjoyed relatively good export success, considering the neutral status of Sweden, with the following countries ordering the weapon:-

Economic conductivity

Economic Conductivity (2008) is a sophisticated financial analysis of an oil or natural gas reservoir's ability to provide maximum financial payout through optimized productive capacity.
Oil and natural gas are typically found hundreds or thousands of feet underground in the small pores of rock formations. The conductivity or permeability of a reservoir is one of the most critical factors in getting oil and gas to the surface. Reservoirs are often treated by hydraulic fracturing or other activities to stimulate greater conductivity.
For petroleum exploration and production (E&P) companies (ranging from multi-national supermajors to small independents) as well as service companies which drill oil and natural gas wells, a single well represents an investment of millions of dollars. While producers have an understandable incentive to minimize their costs, a growing number are choosing to look beyond initial costs, instead designing completion and stimulation programs that optimize production for cost-effective output, saving money in the long run.http://www.epmag.com/archives/features/3205.htm</ref>
Economic Conductivity analysis can result in optimized conductivity under realistic conditions to provide the best return on investment.
The petroleum industry traditionally used simple formulae and basic models to try to predict a well’s production capacity. Economic Conductivity analysis draws upon significant advances in technology and detailed case studies, enabling petroleum engineers to factor in complex variables and downhole conditions such as closure stress, non-Darcy Flow, multiphase flow, fluid velocity, and cyclic stress to determine the realistic conductivity of the reservoir. 
The costs of hydraulic fracturing and other stimulation activities can then be assessed according to the corresponding increases in production, allowing producers to achieve the most cost-efficient production of oil and gas.
Economic Conductivity is measured in millidarcy-feet per dollar (mD-ft/$).
Trademark.
Economic Conductivity is a trademark owned by CARBO Ceramics Inc., a manufacturer of ceramic proppants for use in the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas and oil wells. In 2008, CARBO Ceramics filed U.S. trademark application no. 77/445,017 seeking federal registration of the Economic Conductivity trademark. The application is currently pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Battle of Vilcaconga

After emerging as victors in the battle of Cajamarca, some 180 Spaniards under Francisco Pizarro were in control of major parts of the vast Inca Empire and of its emperor, Atahualpa. After recovering a vast ransom for his release, Pizarro had the Inca executed on July 26 once his army disbanded and crossed the mountains to the south after rejoining Diego de Almagro, commanding some 100 Spaniards. The Incas under Atahualpas commander Quizquiz possessed, after the previous victory in the Inca Civil War tens of thousand Inca warriors around the area of Inca capital Cuzco, the main target of the Spanish conquistadors.
The Inca general commanded to fortified the mountain pass at Vilcaconga where the Spaniards would have to pass, and managed to ambush them, with great losses for the invaders. After a counter-attack, however, the numerically outnumbered Spaniards managed to rout the Inca forces and press further towards Cuzco, capturing the Inca capital by November 1533.

<doc id="18830104" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18830104" title="Brotherhood of the Kingdom">
Brotherhood of the Kingdom

The Brotherhood of the Kingdom was a group of the leading thinkers and advocates of the Social Gospel, founded in 1892 by Walter Rauschenbusch and Leighton Williams. The group was non-denominational, consisting of authors, pastors and orators from a variety of Christian Protestant backgrounds.
First Meeting.
The first meeting of the brotherhood took place in August, 1893 at the home of member Leighton Williams in Marlborough, New York. Meetings would continue annually until 1915 at this hill-top retreat, with members presenting papers, speeches and debates regarding the social gospel and how the coming kingdom of Jesus necessitated social advocacy on the part of the church.
Spirit and Aims of the Brotherhood.
At their first gathering, the brotherhood had adopted a mission statement and eight principles to govern its organization, unity, purpose and ongoing commitment to public propagation for the Social Gospel. These they called the “Spirit and Aims of the Brotherhood.”
The Spirit of God is moving men in our generation toward a better understanding of the idea of the Kingdom of God on earth. Obeying the thought of our Master, and trusting in the power and guidance of the Spirit, we form ourselves into a Brotherhood of the Kingdom, in order to re-establish this idea in the thought of the church, and to assist in its practical realization in the world.
Leadership.
Through their positions as pastors and professors, four members of the brotherhood became the leading voices for its aims and social agenda. Walter Rauschenbusch was a professor of church history at Rochester Baptist Seminary. Leighton Williams was the pastor of Amity Baptist Church in New York City, and also a founding member of the American Economic Association. William Newton Clark was a professor of theology at Colgate Seminary. Samuel Zane Batten was a pastor and founding member of the Northern Baptist Convention.
Rauschenbusch was the most widely known of these four, and published a leaflet entitled “"The Brotherhood of the Kingdom"” which was a sort of manifesto for the group. A famous passage reads:
“We desire to see the Kingdom of God once more the great object of Christian preaching; the inspiration of Christian hymnology; the foundation of systematic theology; the enduring motive of evangelistic and missionary work; the religious inspiration of social work and the object to which a Christian man surrenders his life, and in that surrender saves it to eternal life; the common object in which all religious bodies find their unity; the great synthesis in which the regeneration of the spirit, the enlightenment of the intellect, the development of the body, the reform of political life, the sanctification of industrial life, and all that concerns the redemption of humanity shall be embraced.”
Publications.
The greatest influence of the brotherhood on the Social Gospel movement and intellectual thought was through the publications of its members. The first written work to come out of the group and attract broad attention was Samuel Zane Batten’s “The New Citizenship” published in 1898. This book won recognition and a $600 prize from the American Sunday School Union. It was written as the Social Gospel movement was beginning to align itself with a more liberal theology, and Batten’s aim may have been keeping the movement both socially relevant and grounded in mainstream Christian theology. He writes: 
"Christianity is an earth religion, and has to do with the actual things and relations of everyday life, with such real things as homes and stores, factories, and counting rooms; with such real relationships as buying and selling, marrying and giving in marriage, voting and working. Christianity is an effort to transmute and transfigure the dust of our humanity and the life of our world into the righteousness of the living God.” And, 
“The Kingdom of God is all-inclusive and comprehends every interest and relation and activity of man.”
Probably the most influential book to come out of the brotherhood was Walter Rauschenbusch’s “"Christianity and the Social Crisis"” (1907) which became a leading work of the social gospel movement, and probably cemented Rauschenbusch as its foremost spokesperson.
Other notable publications of the brotherhood include Batten’s “"The Christian State"” (1909) and “"The Social Task of Christianity"” (1911), William Newton Clarke’s “"The Ideal of Jesus"” (1911), and Rauschenbusch’s “"Christianizing the Social Order"” (1912.)

Jelenia Góra valley

Jelenia Góra valley (; ) in Poland is a big valley at the Silesian northern side of the Western Sudetes and next to Kłodzko Valley the largest intramontane basin of the Sudetes. It is situated at an altitude of 250–400 meters above sea level and covers an area of 273 km2. In the 19th century, the lovely landscape attracted the Prussian high nobility, which built magnificent palaces, manors and parks. The enormous number of stately homes turned the valley into one of the most important garden landscapes in Middle Europe.
Geography.
Jelenia Góra valley is surrounded by parts of the Sudetes mountains. It lies at the foot of the Karkonosze, which are also its southern limit. In the east it borders to Rudawy Janowickie, in the west to the "Iser" Izery Mountains and in the north to the Kaczawskie Mountains. The Bóbr runs through the valley along its northern side, its tributaries Łomnica and Kamienna flow, from the southeast and south-west, along the eastern and western side of the valley and open out near "Hirschberg", since 1945 Jelenia Gora into the Bóbr. The name of the valley derives from Hirschberg (translated to Jelena Gora), which is also the most important town of the Silesian Karkonosze.
The valley is characterised by ridges which are separated by smaller basins. Wzgórza Karpnickie near Karpniki is the easternmost ridge, followed by Obniżenie Mysłakowickie basin near Mysłakowice to the west, Wzgórza Łomnickie ridge to the southeast of Cieplice Śląskie Zdrój, the wide basin Obniżenie Sobieszowa near Sobieszów, Wysoczyzna Rybnicy ridge north west of Piechowice and Starej Kamienicy basin near Stara Kamienica.
History.
Already in the 12th century the Polish kingdom built several strongholds against Bohemia near Jelenia Gora valley, such as Nowo Grodziec or Swiny. After Boleslaw I initiated the Ostsiedlung in Silesia the valley was cleared of forests by German colonists beginning in the late 13th century, and several villages and towns were established, among them Hirschberg (now Jelenia Gora itself). During that time the family of Schaffgotsch, which later owned the entire valley until their expulsion in 1945, also appeared for the first time in the region. After the forests lost its significance as a natural border against Bohemia the Silesian Piasts of the independent duchy Schweidnitz-Jauer (Świdnica-Jawor) built several castles in the valley to secure the border and to protect the new villages. Especially during the reign of Bolko II, who was in a constant feud with Bohemia, many fortifications were constructed. 
In the middle of the 15th century Matthias Corvinus, who ruled over Silesia, destroyed almost all Silesian castles. During the Renaissance and Baroque era many manors were expanded, sometimes to splendid palaces.
At the end of the 18th century artists and travellers attracted by the landscape discovered the valley. At first Bad Warmbrunn (Polish: Cieplice Śląskie-Zdrój) was the touristic center. In 1822 Wilhelm, a brother of Prussian king William III, was the first prince of the Hohenzollern dynasty who took his summer residence in the Hirschberg valley. Later the king of Prussia itself bought Erdmannsdorf palace, which he had learned to appreciate in his previous visits. The valley became a princely hideaway. Many new parks were created and manors and palaces rebuilt according to the newest architectural styles. Artificial ruins, small pavilions, cottages, romantic temples and view points created a cultural landscape of international recognition.
At the end of the 19th century Hirschberg valley became one of the most favoured travel destinations in Germany. Tourism by car became popular after new streets, like the "Sudetenstraße" (Sudete road), were built in the first half of the 20th century. Many new hotels were constructed in Hirschberg, Krummhübel (Polish: Karpacz) and Schreiberhau (Polish: Szklarska Poreba), which also housed an artists' colony, and Bad Warmbrunn was one of the most popular spas in Eastern Germany. Palaces and parks became tourist attraction and many art collections were opened for the public.
At the end of World War II Silesia was conquered by the Soviet Union and the valley became part of Poland. The new owners rarely maintained the cultural heritage. Important churches and the castles, testimonies of the early Polish culture before the German colonization in the 13th and 14th century, were preserved, palaces and manors however were neglected, vandalized and sometimes removed. Directly after the war the reactivation of tourism was tried, however as most holiday homes in the valley were occupied by new settlers and the touristic infrastructure was in a sorry state these attempts failed. The parks, the excellent hiking trail network and erstwhile view points run to seed, while most of the art collections were either destroyed or dissolved and spread all over Poland.
After the collapse of communism in Poland a rediscovery of the cultural landscape began, which is increasingly accepted and appreciated by the descendants of the Polish settlers. Today many private and governmental initiatives as well as German expellee organisations and family members of former owners work together to revitalize the touristic infrastructure and cultural heritage, and academics work on the acceptance of the valley as a World Heritage Site.
Parks.
Enthusiastic contemporaries described the Hirschberg valley of the 19th century as one "big English garden". Already at the end of the 18th century Hirschbergs director of town planning, Schönau, created several gardens on the surrounding hills of the city. Around 1800 the first parks emerged in Ruhberg (Polish: Ciszyca) and Stonsdorf (Polish: Staniszow). These early parks were affected by Sentimentalism, as the art of garden design was especially suitable to stimulate deep feelings like melancholy, teariness, amazement or joy.
In the course of the 19th century horticulture became more and more influenced by romantic ideas and a new historical awareness. Instead of different scenes and architectural styles more reduced designs, only consisting of mere scenic elements like trees, groves, creeks, meadows and hills, became popular. Extensive path networks and long viewshafts were a central element of these parks. A prominent example was the park of Fischbach.
The landscape architecture in Hirschberg valley culminated during the 1840s with the work of Peter Joseph Lenné. New parks were created in Erdmannsdorf (Polish: Myslakowice), Schildau (Polish: Wojanow) and Lomnitz (Polish: Lomnica). These parks followed the so-called "zoned landscape garden", a principle which was adopted by Lenné and Pückler-Muskau from England. It was marked by richly decorated gardens around the house which were divided into small sections, followed by a "pleasure ground" as a transition zone and a landscape garden which faded into the proximity. The surrounding countryside was landscaped by Lenné with alleys, paths, lookout points and places to rest.
The large number of parks from different eras, the artistic reference of all these parks to the beautified surrounding countryside and the picturesque backdrop of the Giant Mountains created a unique landscape, which was regarded as a "Silesian Elysium". Since a few years the Polish conservation organization tries to preserve and recreate the cultural landscape, which slowly recovers its lost beauty.
Sights.
Jelenia Góra valley is the natural foreland of the Karkonosze. Many places in the valley offer unparalleled views of the mountains. An outstanding feature of the valley is the large number of country seats and locks, for example Mysłakowice, Staniszów and now to Jelenia Gora or Cieplice Śląskie-Zdrój with park and spa. Chojnik, a castle ruin on a foothill of the Karkonosze (Giant) Mountains, overlooks the entire Jelenia Góra valley.
A lake district in the south of the Wzgórza Łomnickie at the foot of the mountains, created in the 1980s and 1990s, represents another distinctive feature. It consists of a series of dams, of which Zbiornik Sosnówka or Jezioro Sosnówka below Sosnówka and Podgórzyn, with a dam of 1.5 kilometres in length, 20 metres in height and an area of 170 hectares, is the largest.
Important castles, palaces and manors.
For a complete list see List of castles and palaces in Jelenia Góra valley
Wojanów palace.
Wojanów palace (), was one of three former royal Prussian summer residences in the valley. It was first mentioned in 1281. Since 1299 it was owned by family von Zedlitz. Between 1603 and 1607 Nikolaus Freiherr von Zedlitz und Nimmersatt erected a new building, which was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War and rebuilt in 1667 by Christoph von Zedlitz. Between 1832 and 1833 the interior of the palace was altered by a builder close to Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In 1839 Frederick William III of Prussia bought the building as a gift for his daughter Louise. In the following years the park was newly designed by Peter Joseph Lenné. After World War II the palace was looted and the furniture removed. The new Polish owners used it as an administrative building and holiday home. Later it was abandoned and fell into ruin. In 1995 a Polish-Italian company restored the building and it's surroundings, which now house a luxurious hotel, spa and a business centre. The park has been restored to its formal glory (Wojanow Palace home page).
Mysłakowice palace.
Mysłakowice palace () was the summer residence of the Prussian king and the most important palace in the valley. It was mentioned for the first time in 1305. Until the 16th century it was owned by the families of Zedlitz, Stange and Reibnitz. The core of today's building emanated from the 18th century, when Maximilian Leopold von Reibnitz expanded it to a Baroque palace. Later it was, among others, owned by the family von Richthofen and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. Gneisenau expanded it in neo-classical style. After his death Frederick William III of Prussia bought the palace and appointed Schinkel and Lenné to remodel palace and the park, which became one of the most beautiful landscape gardens in Silesia. In 1837 Frederick William III left large parts of his estate to religious refugees from Tyrol, who built picturesque Alpine styled houses. After Frederick Williams death his successor, Frederick William IV of Prussia, reconvert the palace to plans by Friedrich August Stüler in neo-Gothic style. Until 1909 the stately home continued to be the summer residence of the Prussians kings and German emperors, afterwards it was sold for 1,7 million Mark.
After World War II the Communist Red Army occupied the palace. Since 1951 the Polish state used it as a school and largely destroyed the interior. Today parts of the exterior are renovated and most of the park is preserved, even though some important viewshafts are overgrown.
Karpniki palace.
Karpniki palace (), the summer palace of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, is one of the best known palaces in the valley. It was first mentioned in 1364 as a moated castle, which was expanded in the 15th century. Initially owned by the families Predel and Reichenbach, it was bought by Hans I. Schoff in 1476, who enlarged the castle with a two storied mansion. After a fire in 1593 the building was again expanded with two new wings in Renaissance style. In 1822 prince Wilhelm acquired Fischbach, which became the first summer palace of the Hohenzollern dynasty in the valley. Beginning from 1844 it was reconstructed in neo-Gothic style according to plans in part by the prince himself. Wilhelm and his successors also equipped the palace with a remarkable art collection of medieval glass paintings and far eastern objects of art. At the end of World War II it was used as a depository for important art treasures from Silesia and the national library in Berlin.
After the war Russian and Polish soldiers plundered Karpniki, which became part of Poland. In the following years the palace was used as a school and a mental hospital. Over time it fell into disrepair and had to be evacuated. In the following years it was several times depredated and also willfully destroyed. After the fall of the Iron Curtain several initiatives tried to hold up the decline, until now however without success.
The large park of the estate was created after 1822 to instructions of princess Marianne. The arrangement referred to the family of the owners. A bench of marble showed medallions of the prince, the princess and its children, a neo-Gothic monument commemorated to a brother of princess Marianne and the "Waldemarsturm" housed a weapons collection of prince Waldemar. But also cottages, a greenhouse, a cross on the summit by Christian Daniel Rauch and many other buildings and structures were erected.
Today the park is barely visible and most of its buildings are destroyed.

Western Air Express Flight 7

Western Air Express Flight 7, a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Salt Lake City to Burbank, California, crashed on January 12, 1937 near Newhall, California. The twin engine Boeing 247D, registration NC13315, crashed shortly after 11:00 am in adverse weather conditions. Of the three crew and ten passengers on board, one crew member and four passengers perished. One of the fatalities was noted international adventurer and filmmaker Martin Johnson, of Martin and Osa Johnson fame.
The off-course Boeing 247D, "en route" from Salt Lake City, was on approach to the Union Air Terminal at Burbank, California in severely lowered visibility due to heavy rain and fog. On suddenly spotting a ridge looming directly ahead, pilot William L. Lewis cut the engine and "pancaked" onto the hillside to reduce the force of the impact.
The airliner first struck the ground with the left wing tip. It then skidded along the side of the mountain in a curved path for approximately 125 feet, finally coming to rest headed in the opposite direction from which it struck. The point of collision was at an elevation of 3550 feet near the summit of Los Pinetos, the highest mountain in the immediate vicinity.(if links above fail to load report, visit http://dotlibrary.specialcollection.net and select "Historical Aircraft Accident Reports (1934-1965)", then retry report links)</ref>
One passenger died immediately and three more died within a week, as did the co-pilot, C. T. Owens. Martin Johnson died of a fractured skull while hospitalized. His wife Osa suffered back and neck injuries but continued with the couple’s lecture circuit, doing so from her wheelchair. She later sued Western Air Express and United Airports Co of California for $502,539 but lost on appeal in 1941.
One of the survivors was Arthur Robinson, a 25-year-old passenger who managed to hike five miles down the mountainside where he met rescuers from the Olive View Sanitarium who were searching for the accident site. Another survivor was Robert Andersen who recovered from numerous broken bones and became owner-operator of “Pea Soup Andersen’s,” a dining establishment in Buellton, north of Santa Barbara.
The accident was investigated by the Accident Board of the Bureau of Air Commerce, under the authority of the Department of Commerce. The cause was attributed to the adverse weather conditions, coupled with the pilot’s decision to descend to a dangerously low altitude without positive knowledge of his position.

North Star Mine Powerhouse

The North Star Mine Powerhouse is located at the North Star Mine in Grass Valley, California, USA. When the mining operations expanded subsequent to the California Gold Rush, the powerhouse was added. In 1895, it became the site of the largest tangential water wheel in the world. Situated by Wolf Creek, a mile west of the Empire Mine, the powerhouse is a designated California Historical Landmark, and has been turned into the North Star Mine and Powerhouse & Pelton Wheel Museum.
History.
In 1878, Lester Pelton of Camptonville brought a strange machine to the Miners Foundry in nearby Nevada City. The Pelton wheel, about the size of a car tire and referred to as "Wheel One", was put on display for mine owners. It used cups on a wheel to draw water and harness power. Running out of trees to burn, the North Star decided to switch to hydraulic power, and Arthur De Wint Foote designed the wheel which drove four new compressors that delivered of air pressure for to the mine's central shaft. For his ingenuity, Foote was made the North Star's superintendent. 
The powerhouse is now a museum. The New Verde Mining Company donated an acre of land and the remains of the old power house. The wheel was saved from the scrap heap by a Grass Valley resident who raised $2,000 to purchase the wheel and donated it to the Historical Society.
Landmark.
The plaque's inscription reads:
NORTH STAR MINE POWERHOUSE
The North Star Powerhouse, built by A. D. Foote in 1895, was the first complete plant of its kind. Compressed air, generated by Pelton water wheels, furnished power for the entire mine operation. The 30-foot Pelton wheel was the largest in the world, and was in continuous use for over 30 years.
Plaque placed by the State Department of Parks and Recreation in cooperation with the Nevada County Historical Society 15 May 1971.

Right Here (Departed)

"Right Here (Departed)" is a song by American recording artist Brandy Norwood. It was written by Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins and The Writing Camp members Evan "Kidd" Bogart, Victoria Horn, Erika Nuri, and David "DQ" Quiñones and produced by Jerkins for her fifth studio album "Human" (2008). Not recorded until late into the production of the album, it set much of the tone for the final "Human" track listing as it was the first out of several new songs Norwood and Jerkins recorded together following his absence on her previous album "Afrodisiac" (2004). Its lyrics chronicle a woman's talks about mutual support with loved ones.
Picked as the album's leading single and Norwood's first release with Epic Records following her departure from the Atlantic label in 2005, the song premiered on her official webpage on August 13, 2008. Her first release in four years, it was officially serviced to US radio on August 25, 2008 prior to receiving a major release between September 2008 and March 2009 on most international territories. While "Right Here (Departed)" became a moderate hit in the US, where it reached number 34 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, the track emerged as her highest-charting single in years, reaching the top ten of the French Singles Chart, top twenty on the Japan Hot 100, and the top of "Billboard"s Hot Dance Club Play chart.
An accompanying music video for "Right Here (Departed)" was directed by Little X and filmed in Los Angeles, California in August 2008. Loosely inspired by the art direction of Francis Lawrence's 2007 science fiction film "I Am Legend", it depicts Norwood as an angel, who is crossing over to the intermediate state and coming back into her family and friend's lives, comforting them just with her singing. It reached the top of BET's "106 & Park" countdown and was voted number sixty-nine on "" Top 100 videos of 2008. Part of the set-lists of Norwood's Human World Tour (2009), the song was performed live on several televised events, including "Total Request Live", "The Tyra Banks Show" and BET's "Just Human" special (2008).
Background and recording.
In June 2004, Norwood's fourth studio album, "Afrodisiac", was released on Atlantic Records. While the album became a critical success, it enjoyed mediocre commercial success only: Though it debuted at number three on the "Billboard" 200, it generally failed to chart or sell noticeably outside the United States. Lead single "Talk About Our Love", featuring rapper Kanye West, reached number six in the United Kingdom but later singles failed to score successfully on the popular music charts. The following year, after eleven years with the company, Norwood asked for and received an unconditional release from Atlantic, citing her wish to "to move on" as the main reason for her decision. Completing her contract with the label, a compilation album compiling her first four studio albums with Atlantic, entitled "The Best of Brandy", was released in March 2005. Thereupon, she reportedly started shopping for a new record deal under Knockout Entertainment, her brother's vanity label, and began work on her fifth studio album independently with a wider range of songwriters and producers.
Penned by Evan "Kidd" Bogart and his fellow Writing Camp members Victoria Horn, Erika Nuri and David Quiñones, "Right Here (Departed)" was not recorded until late into the production of the "Human" album. It was the first out of several Rodney Jerkins-crafted demo tracks "Human" A&R Brandon Creed presented to Norwood and the first song Jerkins and Brandy recorded together at the 2nd Floor Studios in Los Angeles following the pair's musical reunification in early June 2008. It would eventually version as the result convinced Norwood and her team to replace actual main producer Brian Kennedy in favor of Jerkins. While "Right Here (Departed)" was not specifically created for Brandy or the "Human" album, Bogart called it an "honor" to have the singer record one of their songs. "I think it's definitely a great comeback song for her, stylistically and conceptually," he said. "It's like working a new artist." Her first record as a member of The Writing Team, Erika Nuri, added: "It is truly an honor and a blessing to have her first single, especially knowing that so many other great songwriters and producers were gunning for it and are on the album. I do think it's a perfect comeback song for her. A song for her old fans, but also new enough for kids that have never heard her before to gravitate too."
Norwood noted the song "a Brandy song" and "reconnect" with Jerkins: "Our experience this time has been very magical," she said about collaboration with Jerkins. "Our sound is a little bit different from our old sound, it's like something that we would have done but on another level. Like the new version of who we are [..." Lyrically, "Departed" chronicle a woman's talks about mutual support with loved ones. Recorded with therapeutical background, Norwood has noted the fatal 2006 car accident, in which she was involved, as a reason for its inclusion on the album. "To know that you have somebody by your side who is gonna always be there for you, that comforts you in a way and that kinda gives you an extra confidence about yourself," she said, "And that's what I love about it: It's first the message and than you get into the beat and the whole musical part of it. I think everyone's gonna be able to relate to that [...] It's universal."
Release and reception.
The song premiered on Norwood's official webpage on August 13, 2008. A remix of "Right Here (Departed)", featuring rapper The Game, was released in November 2008, with another remix featuring former Epic Records label mate Sean Kingston being leaked in December 2008.
Upon its release, the track garnered generally positive reviews by music critics. Alex Macpherson of "The Guardian" declared "Right Here (Departed)" "Human"s "finest moment" and wrote that "Norwood turns to face the world, though: 'Right Here (Departed)' is a cosmic, ride-or-die declaration of epic scope." Emmanuel Ezugwu, reviewer for RWD Magazine, called the song a "joyous ode to overcoming insurmountable odds." "Los Angeles Times" writer Mikael Wood, barely satisfied with "Human" in general, called "Right Here (Departed)" one of the "few highlights" on the album, stating: "Catchy lead single 'Right Here (Departed)' manages to dial down Brandy's introspection and increase the groove factor."
Shanel Odum from "Vibe" called the track "a graceful return to her melodic origins" and praised Norwood's "husky but hopeful, but still pain-infused" vocal performance. "Newsday" reviewer Glenn Gamboa wrote: "With the help of producer Rodney Jerkins, Brandy radiates warmth and hopefulness throughout "Human" – not in the naive way of someone who doesn't know any better, but in the determined way of someone who does. Her delivery on the up-tempo "Right Here (Departed)" reflects those choices. There's no showing off with vocal acrobatics or flashy production, just a premium on the melody and the mood."
Live performances.
Next to many performances during the promotional tour of her album "Human" on talk shows including The Tyra Banks Show, Good Morning America, 106 & Park and TRL, Brandy also performed the song on the fourth season of Nigeria's Project Fame and at the 2011 South African Sports Awards.
Chart performance.
Brandy's first release in four years, "Right Here (Departed)" premiered via Brandy's official webpage on August 13, 2008, and officially serviced to US radio on August 25, 2008. It debuted at number 83 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 issue dated September 27, 2008, being the fourth-highest new entry of the week. Although the song fell four spots the following week, it slowly rose week by week and eventually peaked at number 34 on the Hot 100 chart, following the album's release on December 9. On "Billboard"'s genre charts, the single reached the top spot on the Hot Dance Club Play chart (becoming Brandy's first single to do so) and number 22 on both the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and the Pop 100 charts.
In Canada, "Right Here (Departed)" became Brandy's highest-charting single since 2002's "What About Us?". It debuted at number 95 on the Canadian Hot 100, dropped one week after and made a re-entry a month later on the chart, eventually rising to its peak position of number 39. In Europe, the single reached number twenty-four on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart and moreover made it to the top ten in France, where it became her best-selling effort in ten years, reaching a peak position of number seven based on digital downloads only. It has since remained thirthy-seven weeks within the top 100 of the chart. In addition, "Right Here" scored top forty entries in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden, where it outsold any single release taken from previous album "Afrodisiac" (2004).
Music video.
The music video for "Right Here (Departed)", Norwood's first collaboration with Canadian director Little X, was filmed on August 17, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. The concept of the video was chosen out of several different ideas. Norwood, who cited the "realness" of X's treatment as its strength, described the video about being there for a loved one. The concept depicts Norwood as an angel, who is "crossing over to the other side and coming back into my family's life. Just popping up everywhere, just singing to them," she said, also noting its "I Am Legend" feel. "You can take it like you're talking about a mother and a daughter, a sister, brother, girlfriend, whatever — it's universal in that way [...] sometimes you see me on the street by myself completely, and it's pretty cool. I'm really excited about it [...]."
Shot on-street and in front of a greenscreen, it features cameo appearances by Jerkins and Norwood's younger brother Ray J, also starring actor Cory Hardrict as a central character. The full production of the clip was tracked by BET's "Access Granted" television series, with the final cut eventually premiering on small screen on September 3, 2008 at the end of its "Access Granted" episode and online at 3:00 pm PT on Yahoo! Music. Although the shooting of a scene with Norwood interacting with a young girl was captured by "Access Granted", the sequence was not included into the final cut of the video. On October 31, 2008, the video reached number one on BET's "106 & Park" countdown. In addition, it was voted number 69 on "" Top 100 videos of 2008.
The video begins with the widescreen opening up and with the title name. In the first verse, Norwood appears in front of the sky and on a sidewalk near town when she sings to a man, giving him solace. During the second verse and chorus, a woman is walking out of a factory crying. When Norwood appears to her, the cars standing in the parking lot disappear. During the bridge, Norwood appears on two bridges and a tunnel. At the end of the video, Norwood disappears and the man and woman wake up from their daydream, both looking more comfortable.

Grey Roots Museum and Archives

Grey Roots Museum and Archives began as a County museum in 1955. Since then it has taken a large role in preserving the history and promoting the heritage of Grey County.
The current facility is located just south of Owen Sound on Grey Road 18. It was opened in 2004, constructed from materials that characterize the development of the County. The building houses the County museum, archives, and tourism offices. There is also Moreston Heritage Village adjacent to the main building, with volunteers and buildings portraying the development of Grey County from the 1850s to the 1920s.
History.
The Museum Committee began to borrow artefacts for temporary exhibits in 1955, but a permanent museum was founded in 1959 with the help of the Grey County Historical Art Society as an art gallery and museum. A more spacious arrangement was made in 1967 with the help of the city of Owen Sound, and the new Grey County-Owen Sound Centennial Museum was opened. The museum would grow at this site, developing its own heritage village, until 2004. The Grey County Archives was established in 2000 in the former Glenelg municipal building in the Municipality of West Grey. As the Grey County Museum and the Grey County Archives both faced a shortage of space to expand, new property was acquired off Grey Rd 18, and both museum and archives were moved to this site. Six of the buildings from the Heritage Village were moved to the new site, with plans for a total of twenty buildings upon completion.
Logo.
The logo is a multi-coloured sheaf, each colour representing a different element of Grey County. The green symbol takes the outline of a tree, representing forestry. The grey symbol represents the rock wall of the escarpment. The red symbol represents fireworks, or celebration of people. The yellow represents grain, because of Grey County's agricultural heritage, and the blue represents water, such as Grey County's many waterfalls.
Facility and Village.
The Grey Roots building is based on a natural theme, as is the logo and main gallery. Construction materials include concrete, stone, maples and cedar wood, all significant materials in the economic development of Grey County. The building incorporates all elements of the logo, including a limestone exterior, a timber framed entrance reminiscent of a Grey County barn, and even a small waterfall in the foyer.
The Moreston Heritage Village, located just beside the main building, spans a time period from the 1850s to the 1920s. There is an 1850s Log Cabin and Blacksmith Shop, as well as an 1880s Log House and a 1920s Farmhouse, Bluewater Garage, George Rice Blacksmith Shop, Timberframe Barn, Good Cheer Bandstand and Schoolhouse, with future plans for twenty buildings. The village is named Moreston after the generous donation of the property by Barry More and the More family, and is open in the summer months and for certain school programs and special events throughout the year. 
Collections.
The Museum has been collecting artefacts relevant to the historical and cultural development of the County since 1955, with artefacts ranging from pre-settlement to present time. Each artefact in the collection is accessioned, digitized (digitally photographed), cleaned, catalogued and housed according to current Canadian Museum Standards. As per most Canadian museums, only a fraction of the collection is exhibited at one time, and artefacts rotate onto exhibition depending on the exhibition schedule and often compliment larger, rented exhibits. The majority of the exhibited items can befound in the Moreston Heritage Village buildings which are open seasonally. The collection and active accessioning of artefacts centres on telling the stories of Grey County through identified interpretive themes, which are: First Nations History, Pre- and Post-European contact, Pioneers and Early Settlers (1830s to 1855), Farm Life and Agriculture, Industrial Development, Commercial Development, Military History, Transportation and Noteworthy Names - Who Are We? 
Grey Roots Museum and Archives also has a separate education/hands-on collection which consists of items that can be used for teaching school groups and speciality groups. This collection is made up of items that are surplus to the collection, have little or unknown provenance, are not specifically related to Grey County or are purpose-bought.
The vast majority of the museum's collection are donated by current or past residents or descendants of Grey County residents, but the museum also, from time to time, purchases items for its collection which meet its collecting mandate.
The Archives collection contains over 500 collections, including land abstracts, municipal records, and private collections. All artefacts and collections are stored in areas with temperature, light, and humidity controls.
Exhibits.

James McKay (industrialist)

James McKay (1830-1906) was a 19th-century industrialist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The founder and owner of the James McKay Company of Pittsburgh, a manufacturer of metal chains, he was also active in oil and gas development with one of the earliest producing properties in Pennsylvania. He also was part owner of one of the largest silver mines in the state of Colorado.
Early career.
James McKay was born in Ireland in 1830, and was the first of his family to come to the shores of the United States. He arrived here in 1848, and for a short time made his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but the year after his arrival moved to Pittsburgh. He found employment with Robert Watson, the owner of a wholesale grocery house. Later he succeeded Mr. Watson in this business and organized the firm of McKay & Philips, after a time purchasing the interests of Mr. Philips and formed the firm of McKay & Brothers, who carried on this business very successfully.
Oil Interests.
Mr. McKay became identified with the oil industry in 1876, and took a small interest in a company which was formed in Pittsburgh, and which had a lease on some oil fields in Butler county, known as the "Jenkins" oil farm. Before oil was struck Mr. McKay bought out the interests of all the others concerned in this company, and shortly afterwards was successful in making a decided oil strike. This produced about three thousand dollars per day, but owing to the inadequate facilities of the time and the incompetency in handling the outflow, the greater part of this was lost. Mr. McKay, continued in this field for a number of years, and finally disposed of his interests in 1895.
Mining Interests.
He then, in conjunction with W. J. Hammond, purchased in Colorado what was known as the Yankee Girl Silver Mine, which was one of the largest mines ever worked in that region of Colorado. It contained rich deposits, and Mr. McKay continued in gold and silver mining until his death.
James McKay & Co.
The firm of McKay and Hammond was located at the corner of Twenty-ninth and Liberty streets, where they were engaged in the manufacture of chains. Mr. McKay purchased all the interests of his partners in 1887 and organized the firm of James McKay & Company, taking into partnership his two sons, Robert J. and J. Albert. The firm was changed to a stock company in 1905, and Mr. McKay retired, turning over all his interests to his three sons, the two mentioned above and Thomas J. The plant was located at McKee's Rocks, Pennsylvania, and was eventually sold in the 1960s to Teledyne Corporation.
Other Business Interests.
He was the vice-president of the Duquesne National Bank of Pittsburgh for many years, and held this office at the time of his death. He was an extensive property owner in Pittsburgh, as well as in West Virginia, Kentucky, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona and California.
Marriage.
Mr. McKay married Anna Eliza Watson, daughter of Robert and Eliza (Stewart) Watson, and granddaughter of Rev. Robert Stewart, a Methodist minister of Ireland. Robert Watson and his wife were both natives of Ireland, where they were married, and emigrated to this country in 1829 or 1830. They made their first home in Kentucky, going there on a barge on the Ohio river. In Kentucky Mr. Watson was a builder of flatboats, and upon coming to Pittsburgh became a contractor and builder of boats, but later engaged in the grocery trade. Both he and his wife spent the remainder of their lives in Pittsburgh.
Beaumaris.
In the 1880s the McKays purchased an island in the then-newly settled resort area of Beaumaris on Lake Muskoka, Ontario. The island, named "Fairholm" was conceived as a family enclave for the summer, much like similar developments during this era in the Adirondack Mountains. McKay eventually built four cottages on the island which were shared by his children and passed down to their offspring. To this day, three of the cottages are still owned by McKay's descendants and are enjoyed by the sixth consecutive generation.
Children.
McKay died on April 30, 1906 and his wife died July 15, 1929.
Mr. and Mrs. McKay were the parents of several children:

Sidarta Ribeiro

Sidarta Tollendal Gomes Ribeiro (Brasília, April 16, 1971) is a Brazilian neuroscientist and Director of the Brain Institute at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), which he joined in 2008 as Full Professor. From 2009-2011, he served as Secretary of the "Brazilian Society for Neuroscience and Behavior". Sidarta Ribeiro is currently the Chair of the Regional Committee in Brazil of the "Pew Latin American Fellows Program in the Biomedical Sciences". He is also member of the Steering Committee of the "Latin American School for Educational, Cognitive and Neural Sciences" [http://2013.laschool4education.com/].
Gathering Neuroscientists in Natal.
In the 1990s, Sidarta Ribeiro and fellow neuroscientists Claudio Mello, Sergio Neuenschwander, Antonio Pereira, Cecília Hedin-Pereira, Claudia Vargas and Mário Fiorani, began the repatriation project that gave origin to the International Institute for Neuroscience of Natal (ELS-IINN), founded by Sidarta Ribeiro, Miguel Nicolelis and Claudio Mello in 2003. This initiative was promoted by the public sector, with decisive support from the Ministries of Education and Science. As a consequence, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) undertook the creation of a world-class neuroscience research center in Natal as part of its strategic plan for future development. In order to implement the project in a solid manner, the university engaged since 2008 in a major recruitment effort, publicized internationally in venues such as Nature and Science magazine, to recruit a group of faculty with international training in some of the most prestigious research centers in the world. The group currently includes 18 faculty duly selected by public contests: Adriano Tort, Antonio Pereira, Maria Bernardete de Sousa, Claudio Queiroz, Diego Laplagne, Draulio de Araujo, Lia Bevilaqua, Katarina Leão, Kerstin Schmidt, Jesper Ryge, Marcos Costa, Martin Cammarota, Richardson Leão, Rodrigo Pereira, Sandro de Souza, Sergio Neuenschwander, Sidarta Ribeiro, and Tarciso Velho. On May 13, 2011, Sidarta Ribeiro took part in the inauguration of the Brain Institute (Instituto do Cérebro - ICe), together with Ivonildo do Rego and Angela Paiva, former and current Presidents of UFRN, academic leaders, faculty, technicians and students. On July 26, 2011, the newspaper Folha de São Paulo published an article reporting the split between Miguel Nicolelis and the faculty of UFRN recruited for the Natal Neuroscience project. The main reason cited for the split was the lack of access of the University’s faculty to the equipment at IINN-ELS. This information was confirmed by "Science" magazine. An article in the Brazilian magazine "Piauí" further clarified that the faculty exodus from the ELS-IINN was caused by widespread dissatisfaction with Nicolelis’ management.

Solium Infernum

Solium Infernum is a turn-based strategy computer game for Microsoft Windows from independent game developer Cryptic Comet, creator of "Armageddon Empires", and was released on November 26, 2009.
Gameplay.
Players control an archfiend who is trying to secure the throne of Hell, staving off up to five rivals in the process. The game's artificial intelligence makes up the numbers if not enough players are available to control each archfiend. The game features diplomacy as well as military tactics, making it possible to gamble 'prestige' on the outcome of battles, as well as other tactics to raise the player character's standing amongst the archfiends.
Reception.
"Solium Infernum" failed to receive much attention from the mainstream gaming press, with few publications following the game or publishing reviews; however it was met with critical acclaim from independent journalists and gaming blogs. Quintin Smith was highly enthusiastic towards "Solium Infernum", writing in Eurogamer that it "kicked my knees out from under me. It's unlike anything I've ever played" and stating in his GameSetWatch column "more than any game I've played in years Solium Infernum nails the sensation of staring at a screen and losing yourself in the cold glory of a difficult decision." Rock, Paper, Shotgun covered the game heavily, dedicating a large series of posts to a turn-by-turn review of the multiplayer mode, with Kieron Gillen calling "Solium Infernum" "one of 2009’s most intriguing, subtle and just plain best games." PC Gamer gave "Solium Infernum" 85%.

Mike Hartline threw two touchdowns to receiver Randall Cobb and led Kentucky to a 42–0 victory. Hartline had a great first game of the season, throwing 18 of 27 for 222 yards. Cobb caught a 27-yard pass for Kentucky's first touchdown. He also took a direct snap from center and ran 11 yards for a third-quarter touchdown. The versatile sophomore had seven catches for 96 yards. Kentucky's defense also performed very well, picking off Miami twice and holding the Redhawks to under 200 yards of total offense. All-American cornerback Trevard Lindley intercepted a pass in the 3rd quarter and returned it for a 25-yard touchdown. That was Lindley's tenth career interception and his second returned for a touchdown. The pass intercepted was in the second quarter by senior safety Calvin Harrison. Another star of the game was the debut of junior receiver Chris Matthews. Matthews caught a touchdown pass from Hartline late in the 2nd quarter. This was Kentucky's first shut out since 1996 when they shut out Vanderbilt.

"Kentucky wins the 2009 Governor's Cup trophy for the third straight year"
For the third straight season the Kentucky Wildcats defeated the Louisville Cardinals and won the Governor's Cup. This is Kentucky's longest streak since the rivalry was renewed in 1994. Derrick Locke returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown and ran for another. A fumbled kickoff return set up Kentucky's final score late in the 4th quarter, a 12-yard pass from Mike Hartline to a leaping Randall Cobb—his former rival for the starting quarterback job. Prior to that, Louisville (1–1) had taken the lead by forcing three consecutive Wildcats turnovers.
This back-and-forth battle for the Governor's Cup wasn't won until the final 2 minutes when Louisville quarterback Justin Burke was driving for a potential game-winning score, only to have a pass tipped by Corey Peters and picked off by Sam Maxwell. Kentucky had to punt the ball back to Louisville, but Burke's last-second Hail Mary was incomplete.
For the 9th straight season, the team that rushes for the most yards went on to win the game. Kentucky out gained Louisville running for 168 yards to 133 yards.

In the third quarter, Randall Cobb scored on a 12-yard touchdown run and LaRod King caught a 21-yard touchdown pass from Newton to draw Kentucky to within 27–20. Kentucky shut out Georgia in the fourth quarter and scored two touchdowns on Derrick Locke's 60-yard pass reception from Newton and Cobb's 1-yard run to give Kentucky the 34–27 win. Newton finished with 137 yards and 3 touchdowns passing, completing 9 of 17 attempts. Locke had 80 yards rushing and 2 receptions for 80 yards and two touchdowns. Cobb had 40 yards and 2 touchdowns rushing and one reception for 19 yards.
The Kentucky defense played a huge role in securing the victory late in the game. Kentucky defensive lineman Shane McCord intercepted a Georgia pass with just under ten minutes remaining in the game. With five and a half minutes left in the game a Georgia quarterback and running back fumbled an exchange at the Kentucky 2-yard line and Kentucky linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered.

<doc id="18830689" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18830689" title="Straight edge">
Straight edge

Straight edge is a subculture and subgenre of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco, and other recreational drugs. It was a direct reaction to the sexual revolution, hedonism, and excess associated with punk rock. For some, this extends to not engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term was adopted from the song "Straight Edge" by the 1980s hardcore punk band Minor Threat.
Straight edge emerged amid the mid-1980s hardcore punk scene. Since then, a wide variety of beliefs and ideas have been associated with some members of the movement, including vegetarianism, animal rights, and Christianity. While the commonly expressed aspects of the straight edge subculture have been abstinence of alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs, there have been considerable variations on how far to take the interpretations of "abstaining from intoxicants" or "living drug free." Disagreements often pertain to the primary reasons for living straight edge. Straight edge politics vary widely, from left-wing and revolutionary, to conservative.
Approaches.
While some straight edge groups are treated as a "gang" by law enforcement officials, a 2006 study found the vast majority of people who identify as straight edge are nonviolent.
While the early Washington, DC, hardcore punk scene is often praised for its commitment to positive social change, both the youth crew movement of the 1980s and the vegan movement of the 1990s have drawn criticism. Both movements have been accused of extreme male dominance, violence, and intolerance, while the latter is also criticized for its self-righteous militancy.
These perceptions have been reinforced by violent outbreaks between rival straight edge groups in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Reno, Nevada. The "gang" classification by these cities' police departments was exploited by the corporate media. For these reasons, straight edge has often been approached with skepticism, ridicule, and hostility, despite the ideologically less dogmatic and more multifaceted character of contemporary straight edge.
Terminology.
Authors have adopted a variety of terms for the subculture as well as for individuals that have adopted the lifestyle. Several permutations of the term that have been adopted are straightedge, straight-edge, and straight edge.
History.
In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote that straight edge had gone through three eras since its founding in the early 1980s. Later analysts have identified another era that has taken place since Tsitsos's writing.
1970s and early 1980s.
Straight edge grew out of hardcore punk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was partly characterized by shouted rather than sung vocals. Straight edge individuals of this early era often associated with the original punk ideals such as individualism, disdain for work and school, and live-for-the-moment attitudes.
Straight edge sentiments can be found in songs by the early 1980s band Minor Threat, most explicitly within their song "Straight Edge", first wave English punk band The Vibrators song "Keep It Clean" and Jonathan Richman's early band The Modern Lovers 1970s song "I'm Straight", which rejected drug use. As one of the few prominent 1970s hard rock icons to explicitly eschew alcohol and drug use, singer/guitarist Ted Nugent was also a key influence on the straight edge ideology.
Straight edge started on the East Coast of the United States in Washington D.C., and quickly spread throughout the US and Canada. By the 1980s, bands on the West Coast of the United States, such as America's Hardcore (A.H.C.), Stalag 13, Justice League and Uniform Choice, were gaining popularity. In the early stages of this subculture's history, concerts often consisted of non-straight-edge punk bands along with straight edge bands. Circumstances soon changed and the early 1980s would eventually be viewed as the time "before the two scenes separated". Early straight edge bands included: the Washington D.C. bands Minor Threat, State of Alert (S.O.A.), Government Issue, Teen Idles and The Faith; Reno's 7 Seconds; Boston's SSD, DYS and Negative FX; California bands as mentioned above; and New York City bands such as Cause for Alarm and The Abused.
Bent edge.
Bent edge began as a counter-movement to straight edge by members of the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene. This idea spread and on Minor Threat's first tour in 1982, people would come up to the band identifying as bent or curved edge. The counter-movement was short lived and faded away by the end of the 1990s.
Youth crew (mid-1980s).
During the youth crew era, which started in the mid-1980s, the influence of music on the straight edge scene seemed to be at an all-time high. The new branches of straight edge that came about during this era seemed to originate from ideas presented in songs. Many youth crew bands had a strong heavy metal influence. Notable youth crew bands included: Youth of Today, Gorilla Biscuits, Judge, Bold, Chain of Strength, Uniform Choice, and Slapshot.
Starting in the mid-1980s, the band Youth of Today became associated with the straight edge movement, and their song "Youth Crew" expressed a desire to unite the scene into a movement. Vegetarianism became an important theme in straight edge during this era, starting with Youth of Today's 1988 song "No More", which contained the lyrics: "Meat-eating, flesh-eating, think about it. So callous this crime we commit". This catalyzed a trend towards animal rights and veganism within the straight edge movement that would reach its peak in the 1990s.
1990s.
By the early 1990s, militant straight edge was a well-known part of the wider punk and DIY scene. However, militant straight edge punks were not known for being tolerant. They displayed outward pride, outspokenness, and showed a willingness to resort to violence in order to promote their sub-culture. The militant straight edge individual was characterized by being more conservative and less tolerant of homosexuality and abortion.
In the mid-1990s, a number of bands advocating social justice, animal liberation, veganism, and straight edge practices leaned towards metal. During the 1990s, the straight edge scene split into factions: hardline and Krishna Consciousness.
Outside the United States.
In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Straight edge spread around the world due to the relentless touring of youth crew bands and the ease of ordering records from American record labels via the mail.
2000s.
By the beginning of the 2000s, only small groups of militant straight edge individuals remained. The decline in militant behavior is linked to the lack of a well known straight edge band leading the movement. Contrary to news reports that portrayed straight edge as a gang, several studies have shown that straight edge individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people. In the 2000s, there was a growing amount of tolerance of people who do not follow the straight edge lifestyle by straight edge individuals. In this incarnation of straight edge, the musical styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth crew revival style to metalcore to posicore. Straight edge bands from the 2000s include Champion, Down to Nothing, Embrace Today, Have Heart, and Throwdown.
"X" symbol.
The letter "X" is the most known symbol of straight edge, and is sometimes worn as a marking on the back of both hands, though it can be displayed on other body parts as well. Some followers of straight edge have also incorporated the symbol into clothing and pins.
According to a series of interviews by journalist Michael Azerrad, the straight edge "X" can be traced to the Teen Idles' brief U.S. West Coast tour in 1980. The Teen Idles were scheduled to play at San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens, but when the band arrived, club management discovered that the entire band was under the legal drinking age and therefore would be denied entry to the club. As a compromise, management marked each of the Idles' hands with a large black "X" as a warning to the club's staff not to serve alcohol to the band. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., the band suggested this same system to local clubs as a means to allow teenagers in to see musical performances without being served alcohol. The Teen Idles released a record in 1980 called "Minor Disturbance" with the cover shot being two hands with black "X"s on the back. The mark soon became associated with the Straight Edge lifestyle.
Later bands have used the "X" symbol on album covers and other paraphernalia in a variety of ways. The cover of "No Apologies" by Judge shows two crossed gavels in the "X symbol". Other objects that have been used include shovels, baseball bats, and hockey sticks.
A variation involving a trio of "X"s, "XXX", is often used in show flyers and tattoos. Also, it can be ironic based on the fact that three "X"s was popularized in cartoons and television shows to signify alcohol or poison. Historically, moonshiners used an "X" to notate how many times a particular batch of moonshine ran through the still, adding additional irony. The term is sometimes abbreviated by including an "X" with the abbreviation of the term "straight edge" to give "sXe". By analogy, hardcore punk is sometimes abbreviated to "hXc".

After a rather rough start, Armaan falls in love with Riddhima after getting lost with her in a jungle. Gradually, Riddhima too develops the same feelings for Armaan. However, she does not express any of it and instead avoids him. When Riddhima's sister Dr. Anjali realizes that Armaan is having feelings for her sister, she gets jealous and has a bet with Armaan that he can never make Riddhima fall in love with him. This makes Armaan furious and he accepts her bet. Soon, Armaan starts to do things which leaves Riddhima thinking that he loves her. Slowly, Riddhima becomes attracted towards Armaan and falls in love with him. On the day of the Dandiyan festival, they dance together and Anjali realizes that her sister is in love with Armaan now and she goes to Armaan and tells him that the bet is over and he should stop playing with Riddhima's feelings, but when Armaan is about to deny Anjali that he is not pretending that he loves Riddhima, Riddhima overhears their conversation and gets hurt and leaves. Armaan tries to stop her and tell her that he is in love with her but she does not listen and leaves. The next day at the hospital, Armaan tries to talk to Riddhima, but Riddhima ignores him. She scolds him for using her and playing with her feelings. She tells him that they are strangers to each other. Days pass by and Armaan keeps on asking for her forgiveness and tries to tell her the truth but she refuses to listen. When they both save a patient's life, by themselves in the hospital together, Riddhima accepts Armaan's proposal of friendship and tells him that there relationship should not go further than friendship ever again. Armaan agrees to it as he feels that she also loves him and he will make her realise her love for him.
After about 3–4 months of friendship, their fights still continue and Riddhima feels that Armaan is not a bad-hearted person and her feelings for Armaan starts to erupt again, but she doesn't show any feelings in front of him. Two new interns dr.muskkan and dr.Rahul who does not agree with each other at all but they eventually fall in love. One day Armaan bets to have a bike race with dr.Rahul everyone is voting for Armaan. During the bike race Armaan gets into a severe accident and gets badly injured. When Riddhima find out about this, she runs towards the hospital with tears in her eyes and dr.gupta tells her to take care of Armaan as her patient. She even stays the whole night in his bedroom to take care of him. When Armaan wakes up, Atul tells him how Riddhima was so worried about his health and took care of him while he was fighting between life and death. Hearing that Armaan gets very happy and tries to ask Riddhima why she is so concerned about him, but she doesn't give any response. Armaan makes a resolution that he will make Riddhima express her true feelings for him. On the new year eve, he goes to Riddhima, who is standing on the roof of the hospital and holds her and asks her that he knows that she loves him but is hiding her feelings. Listening this, Riddhima gets tears in her eyes and runs away from him. Few days later, when Armaan rejoins the hospital, while doing something he bleeds from his wounds and Riddhima helps him. While doing Armaan's dressing, Riddhima starts to cry and expresses her love to him. She tells him that she loves him as well and they both hug each other. They agree to stay together but they still get envolved into fights with each other. After sorting out their issues the next problem was to make Riddhima's father Dr. Shashank agree with their relationship in which Armaan went through a lot to make him agree involving the media to which Dr. Shashank eventually agrees seeing their love for each other.

With a heavy heart, Armaan leaves her and never comes back. Hearing this she gets very happy as Armaan didn't leave her with his own will but because of his mental condition and she begins to search for Armaan with Sid. She finally finds him, but when she is about to face him she faints from cold and Sid takes her to the cottage where they were staying. Sid finds that Riddhima is dying with cold, so he provides her with his body heat. When Riddhima wakes up, she finds out about the past night and gets shocked and says that Sid used her for his purposes. She says that now what will she tell Armaan, since she didn't protect herself, she decides that she wont come face to face with Armaan ever again. When Sid and Riddhima's situation is revealed to Riddhima's father, he asks Riddhima to marry Sid as there is no other way left. She doesn't agree first as she hates Sid of his doings but when her parents force her, she accepts it with a broken heart. After marriage, Sid does not accept her and ill-treats her. They are about to divorce ech other, but then shashank falls ill and asks them to go to honeymoon. After this they start to accept each other.
When they are about to start their new lives, Armaan appears and leaves everyone astonished, especially Riddhima. Riddhima is shattered when she sees that he has returned (being happy and sad at the same time). When Armaan learns about her marriage, he is also shattered and wonders how he did not marry and how can Riddhima marry someone else. He is heart broken and decides to leave, until Shashank comes and asks for the sake of Riddhima that he has to stay so that she can start her new life happily. Although, heartbroken, he does everything possible to save Sid and Riddhima's marriage. After rigorous trials, he succeeds, but cannot stop himself from falling in love with Riddhima again. Sid and Riddhima renew their vows and go for their honeymoon. Armaan ends up at the honeymoon destination looking for Riddhima since he still hasn't been able to get her out of his mind. On the supposed night of Sid and Riddhima's reunion, Armaan enters Riddhima's honeymoon suite in Sid's absence where they come close and almost sleep with each other, however Riddhima realises it is wrong and runs out of there. Armaan feels Riddhima is not happy with her marriage, so he tries pressuring her to divorce Sid. Sid also pursues Riddhimma. At the hospital, in the I.C.U. an oxygen cylinder bursts, and hence to save the patient one of them has to go inside to shut its valve. Sid tries to volunteer to go in but Riddhima stops him. Armaan feels that Riddhima has chosen Sid over him, so he feels bad. Instead of Sid, he goes inside. He tries to shut the valve but instead the cylinder bursts and cracks appear on it. He then sees that the nurse inside is unconscious because of the absence of oxygen protecting masks, so he gives his mask to the nurse. To stop the unwanted flow of oxygen, he inhales the oxygen through his mouth and falls unconscious. He then makes Sid promise that he will take care of Riddhima. After that Riddhima tells Armaan that just like he thinks he has all the rights on her, she also thinks that she has right on him. Sid is only her responsibility she has to fulfill. Sid overhears it and decides to divorce her for her happiness.
The gang and Armaan try to convince Riddhima. Riddhima decides to go to havard as she does not want Armaan to marry a divorcee. Armaan also gives up after he has a talk with her .On the night of Riddhima's farewell party, Shashank makes Armaan realise how much Riddhima actually loves him and vice versa . Armaan reads between Riddhma's lines and proposes her. She agrees and they both hug each other, sharing a sweet reunion . Their friends including Sid, come and congratulate the couple.Sid sees this from far, he smiles and leaves from there ( giving Armaan and Riddhima a thumbs up). Armaan and Riddhima are extremely happy . They end the show with the gang singing ""hum to chale thay dost ban ke, jane kaha dill mill gayye. "
