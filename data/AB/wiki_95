Tahrir Square

Tahrir Square ( "", , ), also known as "Martyr Square", is a major public town square in Downtown Cairo, Egypt. The square has been the location and focus for political demonstrations in Cairo that saw the resignation of President Mubarak in 2011, and the ousting of President Morsi in 2013.
History.
The square was originally called "Ismailia Square" (ميدان الأسماعيليّة ""), after the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, but the square was not officially renamed until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which changed Egypt from a constitutional monarchy into an autocratic republic. The square was a focal point for the Egyptian Revolution of 2011
Features.
At the centre of Tahrir Square is a large and busy traffic circle. On the north-east side is a plaza with a statue of nationalist hero Omar Makram, celebrated for his resistance against Napoleon I's invasion of Egypt, and beyond is the Omar Makram Mosque.
The square is the northern terminus of the historic Qasr al-Ayni Street, the western terminus of Talaat Harb Street, and via Qasr al-Nil Street crossing its southern portion it has direct access to the Qasr al-Nil Bridge crossing the nearby Nile River.
The area around Tahrir Square includes the Egyptian Museum, the House of Folklore, the National Democratic Party-NDP headquarters building, the Mogamma government building, the Headquarters of the Arab League building, the Nile Hotel, Kasr El Dobara Evangelical Church and the original downtown campus of the American University in Cairo.
The Cairo Metro serves Tahrir Square with the Sadat Station, which is the downtown junction of the system's two lines, linking to Giza, Maadi, Helwan, and other districts and suburbs of Greater Cairo. Its underground access viaducts provide the safest routes for pedestrians crossing the broad roads of the heavily trafficked square.
Public use and demonstrations.
Tahrir Square has been the traditional site for numerous major protests and demonstrations over the years, including the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots, and the March 2003 protest against the War in Iraq.
2011 Egyptian Revolution.
Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. Over 50,000 protesters first occupied the square on 25 January, during which the area's wireless services were reported to be impaired. In the following days, Tahrir Square continued to be the primary destination for protests in Cairo. On 29 January, Egyptian fighter aircraft flew low over the people gathered in the square. On 30 January, the seventh day of the protests, PIK BBC and other correspondents reported that the number of demonstrators had grown to at least 100,000, and on 31 January, Al Jazeera correspondents reported that the demonstrations had grown to at least 250,000 people. On 1 February, Al Jazeera reported that more than one million protesters peacefully gathered in the square and adjacent streets. However, such media reports that so many people congregated in Cairo’s largest public square are believed to be exaggerated for political purposes and, according to Stratfor's analysis, the real number of gathered protesters never exceeded 300,000 people.
The square became established as a focal point and a symbol for the ongoing Egyptian democracy demonstrations. On 2 February, violence erupted between the pro-Mubarak and pro-democracy demonstrators there, followed by the 3 February 'Friday of Departure' demonstration, one of the named "day of" events centered in the square. Within a week, due to international media coverage, the image and name of Tahrir Square became known worldwide.
A Facebook page called "Tahrir Square" ميدان التحرير
was maintained by a rotating staff of twenty during the uprising, particularly to offset the lack of and/or distorted coverage of events and responses in the state-run media outlets.
The 18-day revolt centered in the square provided the Egyptian Armed Forces an opportunity to remove Mubarak from power on Friday, 11 February 2011, when the president officially stepped down from office. The announcement that Mubarak had passed all authority to the Council of the Armed Forces was made by longtime intelligence chief and new vice president Omar Suleiman. Tahrir Square erupted in a night-long celebration after the twilight announcement, with shouts such as "Lift your head up high, you're Egyptian", "Everyone who loves Egypt, come and rebuild Egypt", and others. The next day, Egyptian Cairen women and men came to clean up the square, "they came and cleaned up after their revolution," relaying 'projectiles' in the cobblestone paving and removing eighteen days' worth of trash and graffiti.
Post-revolution.
Tahrir Square, with 'democracy anniversary' celebrations and visits from foreign dignitaries, continued to be a symbol of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. British Prime Minister David Cameron, Catherine Ashton, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the European Union, Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, Chairman of the American Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Kevin Rudd Foreign Minister of Australia, and American actor Sean Penn visited Tahrir Square after the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.
One of the ships in the planned Freedom Flotilla II, intended to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza, was named Tahrir after the square. Among its passengers was Haaretz reporter Amira Hass. Ultimately, the sailing did not take place.
The burnt-out headquarters of the NDP can still be observed from the square.
Revolution of 2013.
On 29 June 2013, thousands of Egyptians converged on Tahrir Square to demonstrate against the Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, demanding his resignation from office. The demonstrators used the slogan "the people want the ouster of the regime," used in the protests that led to the 2011 revolution.
By the 30th, their number had increased to millions. Demonstrations were reported to be in progress in 18 locations across Cairo. On 3 July 2013, General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi removed President Mohamed Morsi and suspended the Egyptian constitution after ongoing public protests in what is described as both a coup d'état, by the media, Morsi supporters and the international community, and, by its supporters, as a revolution.

Mau Forest

Mau Forest is a forest complex in the Rift Valley of Kenya. It is the largest indigenous montane forest in East Africa. The Mau Forest complex has an area of .
The forest area has some of the highest rainfall rates in Kenya. Mau Forest is the largest water catchment area in Kenya. Numerous rivers originate from the forest, including Southern Ewaso Ng'iro, Sondu River, Mara River and Njoro River. These rivers feed Lake Victoria, Lake Nakuru and Lake Natron. Westerns slopes of the Mau Escarpment are covered by Mau Forest.
Ecology.
Typical tree species in Mau Forest include "Pouteria adolfi-friedericii", "Strombosia scheffleri" and "Polyscias kikuyuensis". "Olea capensis", "Prunus africana", "Albizia gummifera" and "Podocarpus latifolius" are also found there.
Endemic bird species in the area include Hartlaub's Turaco ("Tauraco hartlaubi"), Hunter's Cisticola ("Cisticola hunteri") and Jackson's Francolin ("Francolinus jacksoni").
Destruction.
The forest has been traditionally inhabited by Ogiek people, whose hunter-gatherer lifestyle is sustainable. However, due to immigration from other ethnic groups, parts of the forest area have been cleared for settlement.
In 2008, the inauguration of the Sondu-Miriu hydro power plant was postponed due to low water levels, that are said to be resulting from the destruction of Mau Forest.
Mau Forest evictions.
In summer 2008 there has been a political row over resettlement of people, who had been allocated land there during the KANU era during the 80's and 90's. Some of the settlers are famed politicians, like Franklin Bett and Zakayo Cheruiyot. In 2004 Paul Ndung’u released "Ndungu Report", which listed these land allocations, terming them illegal and recommended revocation of them. Some evictions were implemented between 2004 and 2006, without a resettlement scheme.
On July 15, 2008, Prime minister Raila Odinga issued an order that these evictions to be implemented by October 2008 in order to protect the forest from destruction. The order has been opposed by number of Rift Valley area politicians, led by Isaac Ruto. Some politicians, led by Minister of Agriculture William Ruto, propose that if evictions are implemented, the government should allocate them land elsewhere.
The evictions began in November 2009. Some prominent people are set to lose their land, including family members of former president Daniel arap Moi. Also under threat is the Kiptagich Tea Factory owned by former president Moi.

Qasr al-Nil Bridge

The Qasr al-Nil Bridge (originally named Khedive Ismail Bridge) spans the Nile River in central Cairo, Egypt. It connects downtown Cairo to Gezira Island and the Zamalek district. At the bridge's east and west approaches there are two large stone lion statues flanking each entrance, they are late 19th century works by Henri Alfred Jacquemart; French sculptor and animalier. The newer and wider 6th October Bridge parallels its route to the south.
Route.
Qasr el-Nil Street crosses over the Nile on the bridge, from the east bank area Tahrir Square—Liberation Square ("Midan Tahrir") in downtown Cairo, past the huge The Mogamma government building and the Headquarters of the Arab League, then onto the Qasr al-Nil Bridge over the river to Gezira Island. There it passes Opera Square and the Cairo Opera House, with connections to the Cairo Tower and other places in the Zamalek district, and then crosses on the Al-Tahrir Bridge from the island to the west bank's Agouza district.
Construction and name.
The previous bridge on the site, Kobri el Gezira Bridge, was built between 1869 and 1871 by Linant de Bellefonds with the participation of France's Five-Lilles Company. The foundation stone for the present Qasr al-Nil Bridge was laid by King Fuad I on February 4, 1931. After over two years of construction, undertaken by Dorman Long & Co. Ltd, King Fuad inaugurated the bridge's opening on June 6, 1933.
The bridge was originally named Khedive Ismail Bridge after King Fuad's father, Khedive Isma'il Pasha. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the name of the bridge, as well as other Egyptian buildings and bridges, were changed. This bridge was renamed "Qasr al-Nil" in Arabic, which translates as Palace of the Nile.
Public use and demonstrations.
The Qasr al-Nil Bridge, with sidewalks, is popular for strolling in the evenings. The bridge offers views of the river, as well as landmark buildings, hotels, and other structures on the island and along the Corniche Al-Nile on the west bank. The bridge is popular as location for young Egyptian friends and couples to have an inexpensive outdoor date.
2011 Egyptian Revolution.
The bridge has been an ongoing site in the 2011 Egyptian revolution, along with the nearby 6th October Bridge, for public demonstrations on it and as a major route east to the "Midan Tahrir"—Tahrir Square protest gatherings.

MBf later applied to have the defendants (including Wee) held in contempt of court for failing to obey the injunction. The application succeeded against Wee and another of his co-defendants and Wee was eventually ordered to pay a RM7,000 fine on appeal. He was removed from the Kuala Lumpur Bandar seat in 1995 after a controversial court case which nullified his election victory due to the fine he had received. He was ejected from the DAP in 1998 after being accused of damaging the parties' image and went on to form the Malaysian Democratic Party (MDP). He later attempted to join Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) but was rejected by the party who stated at the time they did not want renegades from DAP. Due to the ruling against him in the 1995 court case, he was unable to contest the 1999 election. He contested the 2004 elections but did not even receive enough votes to keep his deposit.
The injunction against Wee brought by MBf was set aside in 2007 with the Court of Appeal ruling "The injunction was too wide in its terms and almost oppressive". He later sought damages against MBf and AmBank (who had acquired MBf) for loss of income due his inability to be an MP and the damage to his professional standing as a lawyer.
Wee Choo Keong was later referred to by V.K. Lingam in the Lingam tape. After the video tape was made public in 2007, Wee stated he intended to file for judicial review of the 1995 decision. Later, he also lodged a report with Suhakam over the tape arguing it demonstrated his human rights had been infringed.
Parti Keadilan Rakyat.
Before the 2008 election, although still a member of the MDP, he was invited to join the PKR now under the de facto leadership of Anwar Ibrahim and contest the Wangsa Maju constituency which he later won with a slim majority of 150.
In May 2010, Wee left PKR to sit in Parliament as an independent, citing disappointment with the PKR-led state government in Selangor's handling of the Dengkil sand mining scandal and what he called "little Napoleons and trendy leftists" taking control of the party.

Accounting Research Bulletins

Accounting Research Bulletins, available full-text at the links below from the University of Mississippi's Digital Collections, were documents issued by the Committee on Accounting Procedure between 1938 and 1959 on various accounting problems. They were discontinued with the dissolution of the Committee in 1959 under a recommendation from the Special Committee on Research Program. In all, 51 bulletins were issued; however, the lack of binding authority over AICPA's membership reduced the influence of, and compliance with the content of the bulletins.

Panopeus

Panopeus (), or Phanoteus (the name is given in a variety of forms in the ancient sources), was an ancient Greek town of Phocis, near the frontier of Boeotia, and on the road from Daulis to Chaeronea. Pausanias said that Panopeus was 20 stadia from Chaeronea and 7 from Daulis; but the latter number is almost certainly a mistake. The ruins at the village of "Aio Vlasi" (), which are clearly those of Panopeus, are about 20 stadia distant from Chaeronea, but as much as 27 stadia distant from Daulis.
Panopeus was a very ancient town, originally inhabited by the Phlegyae. Schedius, king of Panopeus, and his brother, were the leaders of the Phocians in the Trojan War. Panopeus was also celebrated for the grave of Tityos, who was slain by Apollo and Artemis at this place, because he attempted to rape their mother Leto on her way to Delphi. Panopeus was destroyed by Xerxes, and again by Philip II of Macedon at the close of the Third Sacred War. It was taken by the Romans in 198 BC, on the first attack; and was destroyed for the third time in the campaign between Sulla and Archelaus, the general of Mithridates VI of Pontus, in the 1st century BC.
Pausanias said that the city was 7 stadia in circumference, but in his time the place only consisted of a few huts situated on the side of a river. Up until at least the 19th century there were still considerable remains of the ancient walls on the rocky heights above "Aio Vlasi". The masonry is of different periods, as one might expect given the repeated destruction of the city. There are no longer any remains of the tomb of Tityos, which, according to Pausanias, was 1/3 of a stade in circumference, and stood on the side of the river. Pausanias also mentions on the side of the Sacred Way a building of unbaked bricks, containing a statue of the Pentelic Marble, which was supposed to be intended either for Prometheus or Asclepius. It was believed by some that Prometheus made the human race out of the sandy-colored rocks in the vicinity of this town, and that they still carried the smell of human flesh.

Mappin &amp; Webb

Mappin & Webb is a company originally founded in Sheffield, England. The company is a noted firm of Silversmiths and formerly cutlery manufacturers with roots back to 1774 when Joseph Mappin (snr) founded the firm. The company is now a retail jeweller, and Royal Warrant holder.
Arundel & Mappin.
The firm was started by Joseph Mappin, in 1810, with a partner, Mr Arundel. They registered a trademark a "Sun" in 1812 and were trading from premises in Norfolk street and Mulberry street.
His eldest son Frederick Thorpe Mappin (1821-1910) joined at the age of 13 as an apprentice. He then ran the business following his father's death in 1841. His brothers Edward, Joseph Charles and John Newton joined the firm later. The business grew, taking over William Sampson & Sons in 1845 and he also bought a London shop, to sell direct, and later, in 1856, a warehouse. He expanded trade with overseas trips, and setting up agencies in markets such as Canada and Australia. The firm was renamed as 'Mappin Bros.' in 1851. By 1851, he became the youngest ever Master Cutler. By 1852, he opened a new factory on Flat Street, next door to Rodgers' Norfolk street works (now the site of the old Head Post Office), but after a dispute, in 1859, with his younger brother, he left the firm, which later became part of Mappin and Webb.
Frederick Mappin.
Frederick Mappin then became a partner in the Thos. Turton & Sons steelworks and implemented mechanisation of the processes, despite a strike by employees. He became a successful industrialist and later a politician. In 1854 he was elected to Sheffield Town Council as a Liberal, stepping down in 1857. In the 1860s, Mappin became a director of the Sheffield Gas and Light Company, and of the Midland Railway. In 1885 he supported the formation of the University of Sheffield, and was created its first Pro-Chancellor. The University's Sir Frederick Mappin Building is named after him. He was made a baronet in 1886. When he died in 1910 he left nearly £1 million.
Mappin & Webb.
John Newton Mappin started an electroplating and cutlery firm which by 1868 was called Mappin & Webb. The firm was started with his brother-in-law George Webb. The firm prospered but the old family firm of Mappin Bros. had started to decline, as by 1863 the firm was reported as only employing 200 in a local trade review. By the 1880s the Mappin Bros. firm had been sold to a Belfast jeweller, and then sold to Goldsmiths & Silversmiths Co. of London. But in contrast Mappin and Webb run by Newton Mappin was thriving with a large showroom on Norfolk street, displaying the Silverware and electroplate. By 1897 the company was granted a Royal Warrant. Today Mappin & Webb is silversmith both to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and to the Prince of Wales Prince Charles. In 1899 the Sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger was apprenticed to the firm as a metal engraver. Newton Mappin bought the family firm back in 1903.
The company's premises at No 1 Poultry in London were famously demolished in 1994 by developer Peter Palumbo. It was replaced by a controversial building designed by architect James Stirling.
Modern day firm.
The firm was taken over by Asprey & Co. in the 1980s, but was sold later.
The company is now a brand owned by the Jewellers Goldsmiths group.

Brigham Young University Press

Brigham Young University Press (BYU Press) is the university press of Brigham Young University (BYU).
History.
Brigham Young University Press was formed in 1967 through the consolidation of BYU's various publishing activities into one central organization. 
In its prime, BYU Press was a robust press publishing in a wide array of subjects, such as interior design, preschools, dancing, and wood-burning, as well as intellectual, scholarly and fine arts titles. In 1974, the press published "Roughing it Easy: A Unique Ideabook for Camping and Cooking", by Dian Thomas, which later made the New York Times Best Seller list.
The press also published works for Mormon readers and scholars, including BYU speeches and symposia proceedings and the periodical "BYU Studies". Amongst its major publications in Mormon history are James B. Allen's "Studies in Mormon History" series, several of the "Charles Redd Monographs in Western History", the LDS Church's 1965 reprint of "A Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints", Fox and Quinn's biographies of J. Reuben Clark, and Davis Bitton's "Guide to Mormon Diaries and Autobiographies". The press itself received a 1978 Special Citation from the Mormon History Association for encouraging and publishing fine Mormon histories that year. Many of its LDS books have been published in conjunction with Deseret Book. It also maintained the imprint "Young House" during the 1970s.
BYU Press had a reputation of selecting for publication only church approved material. Press officials scrutinized and rejected manuscripts they found too technical or too controversial. These rejections include Dennis Lythgoe's "Let 'Em Holler: A Political Biography of J. Bracken Lee", Béla Petsco's "Nothing Very Important and Other Stories" (1979 AML Best Fiction Award winner), and "Science and Religion: Toward a More Useful Dialogue" by several BYU faculty. In 1973, BYU Press recalled Thomas Cheney's "The Golden Legacy: A Folk History of J. Golden Kimball", a new release, over concerns with some of Kimball's vulgar language. The book was edited and republished by Peregrine Press in 1974.
Decline and return.
Financial troubles struck the press in the late 1970s, leading to a decision for it to only print internal university publications, making it essentially defunct for many authors and scholars. In 1984, the press was replaced by BYU Print Services.
In 1997, BYU Press returned as a logo under the Academic Vice President's office, intended for use with expanded distribution of some titles to other university libraries. Officials made clear that BYU Press would not be an organization or an office. The return was inspired by the production of new religious texts and the university's desire to clear out manuscripts to focus on publishing the papers of LDS Church founders Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, which were then being developed by BYU's Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History. In 2005, the Joseph Smith Papers Project transferred from BYU to LDS Church headquarters, and began publication in 2008 with a new imprint, the Church Historian's Press, rather than BYU Press. The Church Historian's Press may also publish the George Q. Cannon journals, another project formerly slated for BYU Press.
Recent work.
The following are some of the more notable recent publications by BYU Press:
BYU Press has also produced electronic resources from the LDS Church's historical records including "Selected Collections from the Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" and "BYU Family History Digital Archive".
Trivia.
Before achieving wide notability, and after his own theater company failed, Orson Scott Card worked as a proofreader, then copy editor at BYU Press. In this role he met Calvin Grondahl, whose Mormon-themed cartoons were rejected by BYU Press, yet he would later illustrate one of Card's early works, the 1981 "Saintspeak". Card's role at BYU Press led to his later editing job at the LDS Church's "Ensign" magazine.

Replacements (short story)

"Replacements" is a short story written by Lisa Tuttle. It concern a husband's surfacing insecurities as his wife's independence strengthens when she claims a bloodsucking pet for her very own.
Summary.
As Stuart commences his walk to work, he notices an animal "about the size of a cat, naked looking, with leathery, hairless skin and thin, spiky limbs that seemed too frail to support the bulbous, ill-proportioned body." Disgusted and horrified by the appearance of this animal, he crushes it with his foot. Immediately, he is remorseful and his first instinct is to call his wife Jenny. Since he is not sure what her reaction will be, he waits to call her at the normal time in the afternoon. She is not able to take his call and does not return the call either. Stuart calls again, only to find that she has left work early. This, being unlike her, worries Stuart and he returns home as soon as possible.
Once home, he finds that Jenny brought one of the "creatures" with her. Stuart shows strong dislike towards the creature and wants Jenny to get rid of it. The two argue about what to do with Jenny's new "pet" but never come to a resolution. The creature begins taking up more of Jenny's time and attention. She also does abnormal activities with the creature (letting it drink blood from her). As this progresses, Stuart is regarded less and less and becomes very distanced from Jenny. Eventually, Jenny says that she is going to keep it whether Stuart likes it or not. Stuart then decides that he cannot live with the creature and the woman Jenny has become, and he moves out.
He begins to notice these creatures more and more. The women at work, women on the streets - everyone seemed to have one of these creatures. One evening while on his way home from work, he notices a woman sitting opposite with a gold chain that brings back memories. After leaving the train at the same stop as the woman, he strives to come up with something to say, but he sees the chain linked to one of the "pets" he despises and immediately lets her walk away. He absentmindedly walks to his old house where he sees the creature longing to be outside and he longing to be in.
Gothic elements.
Gothic elements are evident in this short story. They include domesticity, the uncanny, and perversity - all of which can be found in this story and explained in the book by Alan Lloyd-Smith, "American Gothic Fiction". Tuttle uses these gothic elements to show how a marital relationship changes drastically by the introduction of a new element.
About the author.
Tuttle is known for her work in the science fiction, fantasy and horror stories genres. She often includes aspects of feminism and specifically feminist science fiction in her writing. Her award-winning short stories often feature strong-willed women (much like Tuttle herself) questioning their lives, identities and gender issues with a probing, insightful reverence. David Barrett, City Limits (UK) once said of Tuttle’s stories, "Her stories are emotionally uncomfortable… they’re powerful, they’re brilliant, they hurt… and they’re very special. They not only make you think, they make you feel…" 
Tuttle's feminist sci-fi short story features a husband's insecurities surfacing while a wife's independence strengthens as she claims a vampire pet for her very own. This story of replacing a husband was written just a few months after the birth of Tuttle's daughter.
Regarding the "Replacements", Tuttle says in an interview with M. M. Hall from "Fantastic Metropolis": "My first post-natal story to deal with in any way with motherhood was “Replacements”, written when my daughter was only seven months old. Make of that what you will…".

Julius Ellsberry

Julius Ellsberry (1922 — December 7, 1941) was the first Alabamian killed in World War II, and one of the first Americans to die in the Pacific during World War II.
Early life.
Ellsberry was born in Birmingham, Alabama and was a 1938 graduate of Parker High School.
Military career.
Ellsberry enlisted in the United States Navy in 1940, and was serving aboard the USS Oklahoma (BB-37) as a Mess Attendant First Class when it was bombed by Japanese planes in the surprise attack on December 7, 1941. He and 413 other crewmen were killed aboard the battleship. He was awarded a posthumous Purple Heart in honor of his sacrifice.
A Navy press release followed shortly after the announcement of Ellsberry's death describing the heroism of another black seaman, then unidentified. Mess Attendant Second Class Doris Miller assumed control of a deck gun on the USS West Virginia (BB-48) after the gunner was killed and helped defend the ship. Media reports at the time often credited Ellsberry with Miller's heroism and the misidentification still sometimes persists.
Legacy.
The "Birmingham World" labeled Ellsberry "the Crispus Attucks of World War II". Birmingham's Black community raised over $300,000 in war bond purchases toward the completion of a B-24 Liberator named "The Spirit of Ellsberry".
Birmingham's Ellsberry Park near Finley Boulevard north of downtown was dedicated in his honor in 1979. A marker honoring Ellsberry's sacrifice has also been erected in Kelly Ingram Park, which is named for fellow Navy veteran and Birmingham native Osmond Kelly Ingram, the first American killed in World War I.

John Henry Whyte

John Henry Whyte (30 April 1928, Penang, Malaysia – 16 May 1990, New York, United States) was an Irish historian, political scientist and author of books on Northern Ireland, divided societies and on church-state affairs in Ireland.
Early life.
Whyte was born in 1928 in Penang, Malaysia. His father was manager of a rubber plantation on the mainland. Whyte's family left Malaysia and returned to Europe when he was three, eventually settling in Rostrevor, County Down, Northern Ireland. The Whytes are a well known County Down family recorded in the area since at least 1713. The Whyte family is said to have come to Ireland from South Wales with Strongbow in 1170 and settled in Leinster. Whyte was educated locally, at Ampleforth and Oriel College Oxford, from which he took a degree in Modern History in 1949. Having continued studies some two years later he was awarded a B.Litt degree for further research, which was to form the nebula of his first book which was to be published in 1958.
Whyte undertook national service during the 1950s and worked as a history teacher in his old school before being appointed lecturer in Modern History at Makerere University, Uganda. In 1962 he returned to Ireland having been appointed first 'lecturer in empirical politics' at the then expanding University College Dublin (UCD). In 1966, he wed fellow academic Dr. Jean Murray and moved to Queen's University Belfast to undertake further studies.
Dispute with the church and move to Belfast.
In his book, "Preventing the Future: Why Was Ireland So Poor for So Long?", Whyte's successor as Professor of Politics at UCD Tom Garvin gives an account as to the clerical politics prevalent at the time in UCD which caused Whyte's untimely departure:
At Queen's Whyte was to spend seventeen years as lecturer and reader, and from 1982 Professor of Irish Politics during which he sought to bring together political scientists from across the Island and develop an All-Ireland political science fellowship. From 1973 to 1974 he worked at as a research fellow at Harvard's Centre for International Affairs, and in 1975 he helped lead a team of researchers investigating the Northern Ireland conflict, then at its height. He also worked as research fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies during the late 1970s and was elected Member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1977, serving as Vice President from 1989 to 1990.
Later career.
In 1984 he returned to University College Dublin, then faced with stringent fiscal cuts and wider problems in Irish third-level education. In his second period at UCD, Whyte led the Department, which he now headed, through a troubled period of financial cuts while supervising a reorganisation of the undergraduate curriculum. In his last years at UCD he completed his seminal work, the widely regarded "Interpreting Northern Ireland". Whyte finished correcting the proofs and compiling the index of this work only a week before his death. He died whilst on his way to the United States for an academic conference in 1990.
The John Whyte Trust Fund.
Following his death Whyte's family, friends, and colleagues set up the John Whyte Trust Fund to continue Whyte's work, honour his memory and encourage "informed dialogue and interaction at graduate level among people who are likely to be leaders and opinion-shapers". To date the fund has awarded one fully paid scholarship and a number of part-paid scholarships as well as essay prizes annually. The fund also hosts an annual John Whyte Memorial Lecture. Speakers have included Paul Bew and Brendan O'Leary.

Earle B. Wood was the secretary and treasurer of the Board of Education of Montgomery County, Maryland, as well as the superintendent of schools, from 1906 to 1915. He was originally a native of Frederick, Maryland. He began his teaching career there, eventually serving as the principal of Adamstown High School. He eventually came to Montgomery County in 1904 as a teacher. At the age of 25, in 1906, he was appointed superintendent of schools, as a result of a petition to the Board of Education. He was unanimously re-elected by the Board for an additional term in 1908.
During Mr. Wood's tenure, the school system's facilities were greatly expanded. In the first two years of his office, he number of high schools doubled from two to four, six additional elementary schools were built, and repairs to existing buildings were made. He attended law school after his career as superintendent, embarking on a second career as a lawyer. The Earle B. Wood Middle School was named after him, as was the Earle B. Wood Park, next to the school, both of which are located in Rockville, Maryland.

<doc id="18816638" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18816638" title="Sea Turtle Restoration Project">
Sea Turtle Restoration Project

The Sea Turtle Restoration Project (STRP), founded in 1989, is a project of Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN), a United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit environmental organization with a goal of protecting endangered sea turtles from human-caused threats at nesting beaches and in the ocean.
STRP states its mission as being:
"To protect endangered sea turtles in ways that make cultural and economic sense to the communities that share the beaches and waters with these gentle creatures."
STRP engages in activities such as educating the public about sea turtles, urging people to get involved with sea turtle protection, advocating for laws and regulations that protect sea turtles from accidentally getting caught in commercial fishing operations, filing lawsuits when the United States Endangered Species Act or other conservation laws are violated, and disseminating information about sea turtles to elected officials, regulatory agencies, members of the media and the public. STRP currently has offices in the United States, Central America and the Western Pacific.
History.
Todd Steiner, a herpetologist and then Director of the Save the Dolphin Project, an affiliate organization of the Earth Island Institute, launched STRP to help strengthen sea turtle protection policies at the local and international level. Steiner had traveled to Nicaragua to assist local communities in protecting their nesting populations of sea turtles. When he returned to the United States Steiner learned that the sea turtles that were protected in Nicaragua were being killed in Mexico to supply shells for the Japanese luxury apparel market. The sea turtle is a highly migratory species that crosses national boundaries as part of its natural life cycle. 
STRP joined international efforts to end the trade in endangered sea turtles by organizing protests at the Mexican and Japanese consulates in the United States and generating thousands of letters and phone calls of protest. Mexico banned the killing of sea turtles and Japan ended its illegal trade in endangered sea turtle parts for luxury items. 
Since 1989, STRP has attempted to address other threats facing sea turtles at nesting beaches and in the ocean where sea turtles spend most of their time. This has included protecting critical nesting habitat in Central America, seeking to establish a marine reserve for the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle in Texas, developing community-based projects to protect local sea turtle populations in the Western Pacific, preventing the capture of sea turtles by industrial fishing operations worldwide, and protecting critical foraging habitat for the near extinct Pacific leatherback turtle off the west coast of the United States. 
In 1999 STRP broke off from its parent organization Earth Island Institute and was re-incorporated as the Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN). That same year STRP staff members marched with people dressed in sea turtle costumes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) meetings in Seattle to protest the conflict of trade rules with protecting endangered species. In September 2008 the movie titled "Battle in Seattle" was released that dramatizes the events surrounding the 1999 WTO protests.
Programs.
STRP currently has five programs that focus on protecting sea turtles and the marine environment. These include the Save the Leatherback program, Gulf of Mexico program, US Pacific sea turtle campaign, Central America program and Western Pacific program. In addition STRP has a public health campaign - Got Mercury? - that addresses the public health issue of mercury in seafood.
Save the Leatherback Program.
STRP began the Save the Leatherback Program in 2000 when a scientific article published in "Nature magazine" stated that the Pacific leatherback sea turtle could become extinct within 10–30 years if its adult mortality was not drastically reduced. Industrialized fishing practices, particularly longlining and drift gillnetting, used to catch swordfish, shark, and tuna, were cited as causing the most adult leatherback mortality. In response, STRP convened the International Leatherback Survival Conference in April 2002. The outcome was a call by leading sea turtle and marine scientists for a moratorium on Pacific longlining and drift gillnetting. In the next few years STRP organized over 1,000 scientists from 97 countries and 280 NGOs to sign a petition to the United Nations seeking a moratorium on high seas industrial longline fishing to prevent the extinction of the Pacific leatherback sea turtle. In 2004 the documentary "Last Journey for the Leatherback?" was released, which depicts the plight of the Pacific leatherback sea turtle.
US Pacific sea turtle program.
STRP's American Pacific sea turtle campaign began in 2001 when their legal action forced a seasonal closure of the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery to protect endangered sea turtles and other marine species. In 2006 STRP and a coalition of environmental organizations prevented efforts by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) to reopen the seasonal closure to drift gillnet fishing. STRP is currently working to prevent the development of a pelagic longline fishery within the California Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) where it has been banned for 30 years to protect various marine species.
Gulf of Mexico program.
In August 2002 STRP merged with the Texas-based Help Endangered Animals – Ridley Turtles (HEART) organization and opened its Gulf of Mexico office. The focus of this program is protecting the habitat of the critically endangered Kemp's Ridley sea turtle through the enforcement of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDS) in shrimp nets and the development of a Kemp's Ridley marine reserve that is off limits to commercial fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008 a record-breaking season occurred with 148 Kemp's Ridley nests found along the Texas coast, which was more than double the figure found in 2005.
Central America program.
Since 1989, STRP has been working directly in Central America with coastal communities in an effort to protect sea turtles. Along with its sister organization PRETOMA which is based in Costa Rica, STRP is focused on decreasing the threats to sea turtles in Central America that include development of nesting sites, killing of breeding females, illegal poaching of eggs, and the incidental capture of sea turtles by industrial fishing fleets.
Western Pacific program.
STRP's Western Pacific program began in 2006 and is based on the island of Papua New Guinea. STRP partners with coastal communities to protect and restore the declining leatherback turtle population and habitat by helping to establish conservation deeds in important nesting beaches and marine waters.
Got Mercury?
In 2002 STRP began its Got Mercury? program to educate the public about mercury levels in seafood and to take action to reduce the public's exposure to methylmercury in seafood. Got Mercury? has tested mercury levels in fish found in sushi restaurants and found high levels of mercury in tuna Volunteers monitor restaurants and supermarkets to make sure they are in compliance with California's Proposition 65 law. Proposition 65 requires the posting of mercury in seafood consumer advisory warnings by seafood purveyors. Got Mercury? developed a free online mercury in seafood calculator that allows individuals to use the Environmental Protection Agency’s calculations to estimate average mercury exposure levels by fish type and amount relative to a person's weight.

Tessanne Chin

Tessanne Amanda Chin (; born September 23, 1985) is a Jamaican recording artist, best known for winning Season 5 of NBC's reality TV singing competition "The Voice" as part of Adam Levine's team. She has opened for famous acts such as Patti Labelle, Peabo Bryson and Gladys Knight, and toured for three years with Jimmy Cliff. She is the younger sister of singer Tami Chynn.
Early life.
Chin was born in Kingston, Jamaica. Her father, Richard Chin, is of Chinese and Cherokee descent and her mother, Christine Chin, is of English and African descent. Her parents were in a band called The Carnations and her older sister Tami Chynn is also a singer. Her cousin Jay Hall is a vocalist and guitarist with UK rockers Grassroutes (and previously The Royal Players), and Jay's brother Leon is a vocalist with ska-fusion act Electrik Custard.
Tessanne was introduced to music at a very early age by her parents. Her mother was the trumpeter and singer in The Carnations and her father was the band's drummer. The family has a recording studio in their home in Jamaica.
Tessanne started performing when she was six years old with Cathy Levy's Little People and Teen Players Club, one of Jamaica's top performing arts schools. Most of her vocal coaching came from her mother, as well as noted vocal coach Lecie Wright. Tessanne learned firsthand about cultural diversity when she moved to England at age 12. She coped with the move by devoting a lot of time to writing songs.
Career.
2006–2012: Early career.
Upon her return to Jamaica, Chin joined the Jamaican rock band Mile High and performed for crowds at many local venues including Jazzfest, Rockfest, and RETV Unplugged. Their style, "rock reggae," was unique and distinct. After going on tour for three years with Jimmy Cliff as a back-up singer, she decided to launch her solo career.
After Tessanne left Mile High, she started writing songs for her debut album. Rudy Valentino and Paul Kastick are her producers. Her debut single, "Hideaway," received heavy rotation on Jamaican radio and select stations in New York. Both the single and its music video were very popular. The song was also featured on VP Records' Reggae Gold 2007. After "Hideaway," she has released two more singles, "Messenger" and "Black Books," both available online on her website.
She has performed at several live shows, including The Air Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival 2006, Reggae Sumfest 2007 & 2012, the Deck Cafe, The Port Royal Music Festival, ABC Slim Traxx, and her very own show "Arabian Night."
Tessanne has collaborated with fellow Jamaican artists Shaggy ("Never Let Go") and Protoje ("Someone Like You"), the Trinidad and Tobago soca band Kes ("Loving You") and was featured in a track by the legendary Jamaican band Third World, titled "By My Side." She appeared as a special guest of Third World at the Highline Ballroom in New York City in April 2011. "By My Side" was featured in the soundtrack of Robert Townsend's series "Diary of a Single Mom" starring Monica Calhoun, Leon, and Billy Dee Williams.
Other noted tracks by Tessanne are remakes of songs by other famous artists and bands such as Foreigner's "I Wanna Know What Love Is," The Who's "Love, Reign o'er Me," Katy Perry's "Firework," and Phish's "Free." A remake of Bob Marley's "Could You Be Loved," which Tessanne performed with her band Mile High, also circulated through the internet early in 2006. Other works include a live performance of "You and Me" written and performed with her older sister Tami Chynn.
On December 6, 2010, Tessanne released her independent debut album available for digital download entitled "In Between Words".
2013: "The Voice".
In September 2013, it was announced that she would be competing in Season 5 of NBC's singing competition, "The Voice", after reggae/dancehall star Shaggy presented her the competition as an opportunity to finally have her big break as an international star.

Thomas Sieverts

Thomas Sieverts (born 1934) is a German architect and urban planner. He is the author of "Zwischenstadt" (1997; first published in English in 2000 as "Cities without Cities: An interpretation of the Zwischenstadt"), a book which addresses the decentralization of the compact historical European city and examines the new form of urbanity which has spread across the world describable as the urbanised landscape or the landscaped city. Sieverts calls this the "Zwischenstadt", or "in-between city", as it exists between old historical city centres and open countrysides, between place as a living space and the non-places of movement, between small local economic cycles and the dependency on the world market. In 2008 a group calling itself "suddenly" commissioned the American writer Diana George to make a new translation of "Zwischenstadt" which they published as "Where We Live Now" (the English phrase George chose as the translation of Sieverts's neologism "Zwischenstadt"). In October 2008, Sieverts came to Portland, Oregon, on the occasion of the book's publication to take part in a week-long symposium about his work, also called "suddenly".
Career.
Sieverts studied architecture and urban design in Stuttgart, Liverpool, and Berlin between 1955 and 1962. He became an assistant lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin. In 1965 he formed the "Freie Planungsgruppe Berlin", becoming Professor of Urban Design at the Hochschule der bildenden Künste, Berlin, between 1967 and 1970. He was briefly a guest professor in the Urban Design Program at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was the Professor of Urban Design at the Technical University Darmstadt from 1971 to 1999, and worked also as a Professor at the School of Town Planning, University of Nottingham, from 1984 to 1989. He served as Scientific Director for the International Building Exhibition (IBA), Emscher Park, Gelsenkirchen from 1989 to 1994, and Fellow at the Institute of Advanced Studies, Berlin from 1995 to 1996.
He is currently a partner in S.K.A.T., Architekten und Stadtplaner, which began in 2000.

Greg Burson

Gregory Lewis "Greg" Burson (June 29, 1949 – July 22, 2008) was an American voice actor.
Biography.
Greg Burson was given the responsibility of voicing Bugs Bunny in the 1995 "Carrotblanca", a well-received 8-minute "Looney Tunes" cartoon originally shown in cinemas alongside "The Amazing Panda Adventure" (US) and "The Pebble and the Penguin" (non-US). It has since been released on video, packaged with older "Looney Tunes" cartoons, and was even included in the special edition DVD release of "Casablanca", of which it is both a parody and a homage. Burson also voiced Bugs in the 1996 short "From Hare to Eternity", which is notable for being dedicated to the memory of the then-recently deceased Friz Freleng, and for being the final "Looney Tunes" cartoon that Chuck Jones directed. Burson also provided Bugs' voice in "The Bugs and Daffy Show", which ran on Cartoon Network from 1996 to 2003. He also voiced several other "Looney Tunes" characters including Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Pepé Le Pew and Foghorn Leghorn on the hit Warner Bros. animated television series "Animaniacs", "Tiny Toon Adventures", "Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries" and "Taz-Mania".
He also voiced Yogi Bear on "The New Yogi Bear Show" (after the death of Daws Butler, one of his influences, in 1988) and many other characters in Hanna-Barbera-related shows and Mr. Magoo in the animated segments of the live action feature film of the same name in 1997 (after Jim Backus died in 1989).
His other voice work includes shows such as "CatDog", ', "All-New Dennis the Menace", "Mother Goose and Grimm", "The Angry Beavers", "Samurai Jack", "The Smurfs", "Super Friends", "The Twisted Adventures of Felix the Cat" and "Garfield and Friends", the feature film "Jurassic Park" and the three "Star Wars" video games ', ' and '.
Arrest.
In May 2004, Burson was later arrested by detectives after barricading himself inside his home in Tujunga for six hours before surrendering. Initial reports have claimed that an Armed S.W.A.T. team had responded to a call from two of his female roommates that he was inebriated, armed and holding a third female roommate hostage. Burson also screamed a stream of nonsensical words at the police when they were alerted to his home. Officers had later discovered that Burson had a collection of guns in his home. One officer says "He was so drunk, we couldn't tell if he was trying to do one of his voices or was just slurring his words." Officer Rudy Villarreal has confirmed all three women were involved in the incident lived with Burson, but none of them were harmed.

The Beach of Falesá

"The Beach of Falesá" is a short story by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. It was first published in the "Illustrated London News" in 1892, and later published in book form in the short-story collection "Island Nights' Entertainments" (1893). It was written after Stevenson moved to the South Seas island of Samoa just a few years before he died there.
Plot.
The story is told in the first person by John Wiltshire, a British copra trader on the fictional South Sea island of Falesá. Upon arriving on the island, he meets a rival trader named Case, who (in an apparently friendly gesture) arranges for him to be "married" to a local girl named Uma in a ceremony designed to impress the natives but to be completely non-binding in the view of Europeans.
Wiltshire soon discovers that Uma has a taboo attached to her which causes all the other natives to refuse to do business with him, to Case's profit. He also hears rumors of Case having been involved in the suspicious deaths of his previous competitors. Although realising that he has been tricked, Wiltshire has genuinely fallen in love with Uma, and has their marriage legalised by a passing missionary.
Wiltshire gradually learns that Case's influence over the villagers stems from their belief that he has demonic powers, as a result of his simple conjuring tricks as well as strange noises and visions they have experienced at a "temple" he has built in the forest. Upon investigating, Wiltshire finds that these experiences are also tricks produced by imported technologies such as luminous paint and Aeolian harps.
Wiltshire sets out that night to destroy the temple with gunpowder. Case confronts him and the two men fight, resulting in Case's death.
The story concludes with Wiltshire several years later living on another island, still happily married to Uma, worrying about what will happen to his mixed-race children.
Analysis.
Stevenson saw "The Beach of Falesá" as the ground-breaking work in his turn away from romanticism to realism. Stevenson wrote to his friend Sidney Colvin:
In an unusual change for Stevenson, but in-line with realism, the plot of the story is less important, rather the realistic portrayal of the manners of various social classes in island society is foregrounded; it is essentially a novel of manners. As Stevenson says to Colvin in a letter, "The Beach of Falesá" is "well fed with facts" and "true to the manners' of the society it depicts." Other than the island itself which is fictional, it contains the names of real people, real ships and real buildings which Stevenson was familiar with from his personal travels in the South Seas.
Of further interest regarding the analysis of this text is its publication history. Censored by its publisher, The Beach of Falesá directly addresses British colonialism while confronting the taboos regarding miscegenation. A comparison of earlier printed editions to Steven's original draft has been a source of fairly recent scholarly inquiry. In a somewhat similar vein, another provocative approach to Stevenson's South Seas writings has been taken through the lens of ethnography.
Reception.
"The Beach of Falesá", along with his two other South Seas tales in "Island Nights' Entertainments", were generally poorly received by his peers in London. Stevenson was known and loved for his historical romances such as "Treasure Island", "Kidnapped" and "The Master of Ballantrae" and so his shift to realism was not widely applauded. Oscar Wilde complained "I see that romantic surroundings are the worst surroundings possible for a romantic writer. In Gower Street Stevenson could have written a new "Trois Mousquetaires". In Samoa he wrote letters to "The Times" about Germans." Edmund Gosse wrote "The fact seems to be that it is very nice to "live" in Samoa, but not healthy to "write" there."
Modern scholarship and the reflection of time has been more kind to Stevenson's late works. What his critics could not see or know at the time is that modernism was just around the corner and Stevenson had begun to experiment with early forms, along with a critique of the European colonial venture (post-colonialism), something most people in the 1890s were not interested in hearing, but within a decade or so, such as with Joseph Conrad, would become fashionable.
Screenplays based on the story were written by Dylan Thomas and Alan Sharp but never produced.

Ivor Royston

Ivor Royston, M.D., is an oncologist, researcher, scientist, entrepreneur and venture capitalist, recognized for his efforts to develop treatments for multiple disease targets and to fund biotechnology companies with promising science, technology or medicines. 
He speaks regularly at healthcare conferences and symposia throughout the United States, Europe and Asia.
One of Dr. Royston's most significant achievements may be his successful efforts to partner academic medical research with industry to take potential treatments more quickly from the benchtop to the bedside.
After co-founding the first biotechnology company in San Diego, California, he and his associates went on to form or invest in dozens of other biotechs, laying the foundation of the region's thriving biotech cluster, one of the three largest in the United States. As a venture capitalist, Dr. Royston invests in start-up companies that have promising technologies for treating and potentially curing diseases, including various forms of cancer.
— Ivor Royston          
Born in Retford, England, Dr. Royston emigrated to the United States with his family in 1954 at age 9, and later, as a 14-year-old, he declared that he would devote his life to curing cancer. Unlike many future scientists, his passion also extended to commerce. This early interest in business manifested itself in a Washington, D.C., high-school investment club of 16 boys — dubbed the Chessmen — that he founded with friends. He also bought and operated an ice cream truck to earn money for college.
These divergent interests — medicine and business — would one day catapult Dr. Royston beyond his peers, transforming San Diego's economy while improving the health and lives of tens of thousands of patients along the way.
Accomplishments.
In 1978 Royston, then an assistant professor at the University of California-San Diego, bridged a chasm between academia and the marketplace, triggering a paradigm shift that forever changed San Diego's medical research community and led to the region's establishment as a leading international biotech clusters.
Royston's reasoning was that private enterprise clearly provided the fastest way to get new, life-saving medicines from the research bench top to the patient's bedside. While serving as a researcher and a practicing physician at UCSD, Royston felt the frustration at the long process required to deliver innovative treatments to patients. That frustration fueled his decisive action to work towards eliminating the disconnect between research and clinical application by founding Hybritech with fellow scientist Howard Birndorf in 1978.
The idea behind Hybritech was to harness monoclonal antibodies to quickly diagnose and treat diseases. Financier Brook Byers, of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, realized the importance of the science and recognized the longer-term value of the budding entrepreneurs' passion, energy and commitment. His firm provided the $300,000 start-up funding, and Hybritech's first product, antibodies for the hepatitis B virus, reached the research market in 1980. The PSA test developed later by the company for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer has benefited countless victims of this deadly disease and set the stage for new blood tests for the early detection of cancer. Hybritech went public in 1981 and, five years later, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company paid $480 million for the company.
— Chemical Heritage Newsmagazine           
Dr. Royston went on to co-found IDEC Pharmaceuticals (now Biogen Idec) and the San Diego Regional Cancer Center (now the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center).
More than 50 San Diego companies trace their lineage directly to Hybritech, its founders and early employees. Among those are IDEC, San Diego's biggest biotech success story, with a billion dollars in sales for its lymphoma treatment Rituxan. Others include Amylin, Cancervax, Gen-Probe, Ligand Pharmaceuticals and Nanogen.
In addition to Hybritech, Dr. Royston has been directly involved in the founding or funding of many biotech companies as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. These companies include: Applied Molecular Evolution, Avalon Pharmaceuticals, Combichem (acquired by Dupont), Corixa, Dynavax Technologies Corporation, Genesys Therapeutics (merged with Somatix and acquired by Cell Genesys), Genquest (acquired by Corixa), HenaQuest, IDEC Pharmaceuticals (merged with Biogen to form Biogen Idec), LigoCyte, Micromet (formerly CancerVax), Morphotek (Acquired by Eisai Corporation), Sequana Therapeutics (merged with Arris to form AXYS and acquired by Celera Genomics), Syndax, Targegen, Triangle Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Gilead) and Variagenics (merged with Hyseq Pharmaceuticals to form Nuvelo).
The contributions to medicine that all of the companies Dr. Royston has been involved with are incalculable.
— Dr. Daniel Gold             
Philanthropist.
Dr. Royston and his family have built a reputation for philanthropy throughout Southern California. In 1987, he and his wife established the Ivor and Colette Carson Royston Advised Fund at the San Diego Foundation to support a variety of healthcare and cultural organizations. The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, San Diego Opera, La Jolla Playhouse, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Jewish Community Center and Congregation Beth Israel are among those organizations to benefit from the Roystons' generosity.
In 2002, presented the Ivor and Colette Royston Research Program Award to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Personal.
Dr. Royston is married to Colette and they have two children. Dr. Royston has two brothers, Elliot Royston of Atlanta, Georgia, and Gerald Royston of Bethesda, Maryland.

St. George &amp; St. Shenouda Coptic Orthodox Church (Jersey City, New Jersey)

St George & St Shenouda Coptic Orthodox Church (Coptic: // transliteration: "ti.eklyseya en.remenkimi en.orthodoxos ente fi.ethowab Gewargios nem fi.ethowab shenouty") is the second Coptic Orthodox church that was established in Jersey City, New Jersey. It is one of over 200 Coptic Orthodox Churches in the United States.
History.
Coptic Orthodox Christians, who adhere to an ancient Christian faith rooted in Egypt in the first century, have established a stronghold throughout New Jersey over the last several decades. The first Coptic Orthodox Church in the United States was St. Mark’s in Jersey City, which was founded in 1970 by Egyptian immigrants, and the congregations have since grown in allowing 15 other parishes in New Jersey alone, including St. Mark's Church in the same region of Jersey City.
The large influx of Copts in New Jersey can be attributed to their persecution in Egypt, in addition to those who emigrate seeking education and financial opportunities. Currently, there are more than 30,000 Copts in Jersey City specifically. St. George & St. Shenouda Church was first founded in 1973, although the actual date of incorporation was January 1974.
Expansion.
The year 1977 marked the first pastoral visit by HH Pope Shenouda III to the US and Canada, including both of Jersey City's two oldest churches (the only ones at the time). There are currently about 1500 Coptic families served by St. George & St. Shenouda Church alone with several others belonging to different church congregations throughout northern New Jersey in particular.

Gretchen Wilson discography

The discography of American country music artist Gretchen Wilson consists of fifteen singles and four studio albums.
Wilson was propelled to fame by her No. 1 2004 hit "Redneck Woman", which spent a total of 5 weeks at No. 1 on the Country Songs chart. The song's album, "Here for the Party" has sold 5 million copies in the United States to date, and produced three additional Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard Country Chart between 2004 and 2005. Her second album, "All Jacked Up" sold a million copies in the United States. The title track was the album's most-successful single, reaching No. 8 on the country chart. Her third album, "One of the Boys" did not produce any Top 20 country hits out of the three singles released, however, the album debuted at No. 1 on the "Billboard" Top Country Albums chart.
In 2008, Wilson released the lead-off single to her fourth studio album, "Don't Do Me No Good". The song failed at radio, only reaching No. 43, giving Wilson her first set of consecutive singles to not make the Top 40 of the country chart. The song was initially the lead-off single to the album, "I Got Your Country Right Here", which had been delayed several times. A second single, "If I Could Do It All Again," became the first single of her career to not chart at all. Despite exiting Sony Music Nashville in July 2009, Wilson released the album via Redneck Records, her own record label, in 2010, and achieved a Top 20 hit with its lead single, "Work Hard, Play Harder."
In 2013, Wilson released three new albums via Redneck Records. The first, "Right on Time", was her fifth studio album, which charted two country singles in "Still Rollin'" and "Crazy," though neither made the Top 40. The second and third — "Under the Covers" and "Christmas in My Heart" — consisted of cover songs of classic rock and Christmas music, respectively. She will also release her first live album, "Still Here for the Party", in May 2014 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of her debut release.

He is perhaps best known for his work on laetrile, a controversial alternative cancer treatment, which he was convinced had a palliative effect on certain mice tumors.
Laetrile controversy.
In 1972, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center board member Benno Schmidt convinced the hospital to test laetrile in order to assert its ineffectiveness "with some conviction". Sugiura found that laetrile inhibited secondary tumors in mice, without destroying the primary tumor, but in a blind test was unable to conclude that laetrile had anticancer activity. 
The initial positive results were not published because, in the words of Chester Stock, Sugiura's supervisor, "it would have caused all kind of havoc". Nevertheless, they were leaked in 1973, causing a stir. Consequently laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems, and a Sloan-Kettering press release concluded that "laetrile showed no beneficial effects". 
Three other researchers were unable to confirm Sugiura's results. Mistakes in the Sloan-Kettering press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents, led by Ralph Moss, former public affairs official of Sloan-Kettering hospital, who was fired when he announced his membership in the group. These mistakes were considered inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in "Science" noted that "even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate." 
The results of all of the studies were published together in the "Journal of Surgical Oncology".

<doc id="18817075" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18817075" title="Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin">
Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin

Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin (June 28, 1787, Korbach, Waldeck — September 23, 1830, Brussels) was a Dutch artillery officer. He took part in several campaigns of the French Grande Armée in Dutch army units of the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland that were attached to that army. After the United Kingdom of the Netherlands regained its independence he joined its army. He commanded, as a captain, a battery of horse artillery that played a pivotal role in the Battle of Waterloo. He died in action as a major during the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Early career.
Krahmer (he took the name "Krahmer de Bichin" only after 1815) originally came from the principality of Waldeck in Germany. He entered the service of the Batavian Republic as a cadet with the 2nd Artillery Battalion in January, 1804. He was promoted to second lieutenant on September 29, 1806, and assigned to the first horse battery of that bataillon. This battery was attached to the (Dutch) "Armée du Nord" of the Kingdom of Holland that same month and it took part in the campaign of Marshal Mortier's army corps in Swedish Pomerania in 1807.
Assigned to gen. Mihaud's first division Krahmer participated in the Battle of Friedland of 1807. After the battery ran out of ammunition, Krahmer's single 6-pdr gun alone continued firing, with ammunition supplied by a nearby French battery. For this he later received the Légion d'honneur.
Krahmer was promoted to first lieutenant on August 8, 1808. He earlier participated in the Dutch/Danish attack on Stralsund, on May 31, 1808, fighting an artillery duel to cover the infantry attack.
After Krahmer transferred to the foot artillery he was promoted to captain on August 31, 1813. He had been integrated into the French army with the rest of the Dutch army after the annexation of the Kingdom of Holland in 1810. He took part in the final German campaign of Napoleon I of France's army in 1813, was taken prisoner as part of the garrison of Dresden, and imprisoned in Hungary.
Battle of Waterloo.
After his release he entered the service of the by now again independent Netherlands in the "south Netherlands" (i.e. Belgian) part of its army in 1814. He received command, in the rank of captain, of a horse artillery battery, part of the combined 7th/8th company of the horse artillery corps. This battery was manned by Belgians. The battery was attached to the First Brigade (col. Detmers) of the Third Netherlands Division (general Chassé) on the eve of the battle of Waterloo.
Initially the Third Division was placed in reserve on the right wing of the Anglo-Allied army of the Duke of Wellington. Later it was ordered forward, behind the British troops of Sir Colin Halkett's Fifth Brigade. When Chassé noticed a slackening of the firing of one of the British artillery batteries (apparently due to lack of ammunition), he ordered Krahmer's battery forward to take this battery's place. He came in line behind the hollow road, to the left of Lloyd's battery, where Cleeve's battery had been.
Now the action unfolded that is depicted in Jan Hoynck van Papendrecht's painting, entitled "De rijdende artillerie komt in stelling" (The horse artillery unlimbers). He immediately engaged a French battery near "La Haye Sainte" that was enfilading the British artillery at the time, forcing it out of position. Next the battery started pouring a murderous fire into the French Middle Guard division, cutting lanes through its columns. When next the Detmers brigade performed a bayonet attack on the French Guards, Krahmer came forward to support it under the direction of Major Van der Smissen. As a consequence the French Guards faltered and eventually broke. This was the turning point in the battle. During the action, Krahmer's battery lost 27 men dead and 21 wounded.
Later career.
For his action Krahmer was given the Knight's Cross 4th class of the Military William Order on July 18, 1815. He next took part in the final campaign of the Allied army in northern France until the fall of Paris.
In the early 1820s Krahmer wrote the words for the regimental song of the Belgo-Dutch horse artillery: "Nous sommes tous de francs lurons" (We are all likely lads)[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/ginn001hand02/ginn001hand02_011.htm].
On August 1, 1826 Krahmer was promoted to major of horse artillery. He took part in the opening stage of the Dutch campaign to suppress the Belgian Revolution militarily in August, 1830. He died in action during bloody street fighting in Brussels, on September 23, 1830.

Foote's Crossing Road

Foote's Crossing Road (CA 613) originates in North Columbia, California and winds through the Tahoe National Forest to connect with the community of Alleghany, California. It is a Registered Historic Place.
The high bridge crossing at the Middle Yuba River, named Foote's Crossing (California Point of Historical Interest No. P401), gives the road its name. Alternate names for the road persist, including Tyler Foote Road, Tyler-Foote Road, Tyler Foote Crossing Road or Tyler-Foote Crossing Road due to Cherokee, California, west of North Columbia, once being known as "Tyler".
History.
Mary Hallock Foote's husband, the civil and mining engineer Arthur De Wint Foote, became manager of Grass Valley's North Star Mine after building its powerhouse in 1895. In 1911, O'Brien, Foote & Associates purchased the Tightner Mine in Alleghany. Foote built the road in 1913 to establish a better route between the two mines. The road was significant during the period of 1913–1924 both as an engineering accomplishment and as an improved transportation route.
Structure.
At a cost of $85,000, using manpower and animals, not machinery, it took six months to build the road, a portion of which is a narrow, roughly-graded, single-lane wagon shelf road, while other parts are paved. Wagons wound around bluffs above the canyons below. Italian stonemasons built the high stone embankment walls prevalent on the tight curves above the Middle Yuba River. Views of jagged, granite ridges abound along the way.
Route.
The Nevada County portion of the road begins in what is now Nevada City's unincorporated community of North Columbia and passes Columbia Hill. before crossing Grizzly Creek, and then the middle fork of the Yuba River.
The Tightner Mining Company and Sierra County jointly built the Sierra County portion of the road, which skirts Kanaka Creek and the Lafayette Ridge on the road's southern side, but does cross Blue Ravine and Rapps Ravine. The Sierra County portion of the road is shorter than the older road.

Winnipeg Route 62

Route 62 is a major north-south arterial route in Winnipeg, Manitoba that has eight different street names. 
The official route begins on Salter Street in the city's North End; its northernmost point is often given on maps as the intersection of Salter Street and Redwood Avenue. As it passes southward over the CPR Winnipeg Rail Yards and past the West End, its name changes from Salter Street to Isabel Street, Balmoral Street, Colony Street, Memorial Boulevard, and Osborne Street North, all in a space of less than two kilometres. It remains as Osborne Street North as it passes by the Manitoba Legislative Building, and then as Osborne Street as it crosses over the Assiniboine River at the Osborne Bridge, through Confusion Corner and into Fort Rouge. The route's name changes to Dunkirk Drive when it enters the suburb of St. Vital at the St. Vital Bridge over the Red River, and again to Dakota Street when it crosses St. Mary's Road just north of St. Vital Centre. The route ends at the intersection of Dakota Street and Aldgate Road in the Dakota Crossing neighbourhood of south St. Vital.
Route 62 is a major arterial route serving both the North End and St. Vital, and forms the westernmost boundary of the downtown core. Osborne Street between the Assiniboine and Red Rivers is a major shopping district, especially in the area between Roslyn Road and Corydon Avenue, known as Osborne Village.

1956 college football season

The 1956 NCAA University Division football season saw the Sooners of the University of Oklahoma finish a third consecutive season unbeaten and untied to again win the national championship. 
During the 20th century, the NCAA had no playoff for the college football teams that would later be described as "Division I-A". The NCAA did recognize a national champion based upon the final results of "wire service" (AP and UPI) polls. The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual "NCAA Football Guide" of the "unofficial" national champions. The AP poll in 1956 consisted of the votes of as many as 198 sportswriters. Though not all writers voted in every poll, each would give their opinion of the twenty best teams. Under a point system of 20 points for first place, 19 for second, etc., the "overall" ranking was determined. Although the rankings were based on the collective opinion of the representative sportswriters, the teams that remained "unbeaten and untied" were generally ranked higher than those that had not. A defeat, even against a strong opponent, tended to cause a team to drop in the rankings, and a team with two or more defeats was unlikely to remain in the Top 20. Generally, the top teams played on New Year's Day in the four major postseason bowl games: the Rose Bowl (near Los Angeles at Pasadena), the Sugar Bowl (New Orleans), the Orange Bowl (Miami), and the Cotton Bowl Classic (Dallas). Because the rules of the time for Oklahoma's conference (at that time, Big 7) did not permit consecutive bowl appearances, #1 Oklahoma did not play in the postseason, with runner up Colorado going to the Orange Bowl instead.
September.
In the preseason poll released on September 17, 1956, the defending champion Oklahoma Sooners of Oklahoma University were the first place choice for 116 of 149 writers casting votes, followed by Michigan State, Notre Dame, Georgia Tech and Ohio State. As the regular season progressed, a new poll would be issued on the Monday following the weekend's games. 
On September 22, #1 Oklahoma and #2 Michigan State were idle. #3 Notre Dame lost in Dallas to unranked Southern Methodist University (SMU), 19-13 and dropped out of the Top 5 permanently (it would finish 2-8-0), while SMU would rise to #5.
September 29, #1 Oklahoma opened its season with a 36-0 win over North Carolina. In Dallas, #2 Georgia Tech visited #5 SMU and narrowly won 9-7. #3 Michigan State won at #12 Stanford, 21-7.
October.
October 6 #1 Oklahoma registered another shutout, beating Kansas State 66-0. #2 Michigan State met #5 Michigan in the rain before a crowd of 101,001 at Ann Arbor, and MSU Coach Duffy Daugherty's "umbrella defense" forced two Michigan turnovers that led to their 9-0 win #3 Georgia Tech was idle, and #4 Ohio State won 32-20 at home before 82,881 over Stanford. The poll saw Michigan drop to 12th, while #8 TCU (which beat Arkansas 41-6 on national television) returned to the top five: 1.Oklahoma 2.Michigan State 3.Georgia Tech 4.TCU 5.Ohio State 
October 13 At Dallas, #1 Oklahoma beat Texas 45-0, having outscored its opposition 147-0 in three games. A commentator of the day wrote, "The overpowering charge of the big red-shirted Oklahoma line ahead of adroit Quarterback Jimmy Harris is just one of the reasons bhy Oklahoma may be the greatest college football team of all time... They showed it in the sudden, lifting charge of a line which moved all of a piece, like a wave breaking evenly along a beach." 
October 20 #1 Oklahoma gave up its first points of the season, but registered its fourth win, 34-12, at Kansas. #2 Michigan State stayed unbeaten with a 47-14 win at Notre Dame. #3 Georgia Tech beat Auburn 28-7. In a game that would ultimately determine the SWC championship, #4 TCU lost at #14 Texas A&M, 7-6. #5 Ohio State lost to Penn State by the same 7-6 score. #7 Tennessee, which had beaten Alabama 24-0 rose to 4th, and #8 Michigan returned to the Top 5 after its 34-20 win over Northwestern. The poll: 1.Michigan State 2. Oklahoma 3.Georgia Tech 4.Tennessee 5.Michigan.
October 27 The new #1, Michigan State went to Champaign, and had a 13-0 lead over the unranked Illini at halftime. Abe Woodson plunged for a score to cut the lead to 13-6 after three quarters. In the fourth, Woodson ran 70 yards from scrimmage to help tie the game 13-13. After an MSU field goal was short, Woodson ran the ball up to the Illini 18. Woodson, who had once held the world record in the 50 yard high hurdles, took a short pass and dashed 82 yards for a touchdown, leaping over State's Art Johnson 30 yards from goal, to pull off the 20-13 upset. 
November.
November 3 Unbeaten (5-0-0) and #1 Oklahoma, met the once-beaten (5-1-0) Colorado Buffaloes on the road, and were losing 19-6 at halftime to a team that was four-touchdown underdog, but came back with touchdowns by Tommy McDonald and Clendon Thomas for a difficult 27-19 win. #2 Georgia Tech won at Duke, 7-0. #3 Tennessee beat North Carolina 20-0.
November 10 
While #1 Oklahoma registered its fifth shutout in seven games, trouncing Iowa State 44-0, #2 Georgia Tech and #3 Tennessee met in Atlanta for a game that proved to determine the SEC title. There were 23 punts altogether, and no score until midway through the third quarter, when Tennessee end Buddy Cruze noticed that Tech had stopped double-teaming him. Quarterback Johnny Majors (who would later be head coach for UT) passed to Cruze at the 35 yard line, and Cruze ran 64 yards down to the Tech goal line, setting up the touchdown that won the game, 6-0. In the poll that followed, Tennessee was the new #1 by a margin of 2 points (1,446 to 1,444) over Oklahoma. #4 Michigan State narrowly beat Purdue, 12-9. #5 Texas A&M beat SMU 33-7 in Dallas, and increased its record to 7-0-1, with the Southwest Conference title and a trip to the Cotton Bowl Classic, and on November 12, was still fifth in the poll. Though on probation since 1955 for recruiting violations, the Aggies had appealed to the NCAA to allow them to play postseason. The next day, however, the NCAA announced that Texas A&M was still banned, because of an additional recruiting violation of a basketball player. The poll: 1.Tennessee 2.Oklahoma 3.Michigan State 4.Georgia Tech 5.Texas A&M.
November 17 
November 24 
December 1 #1 Oklahoma closed its season with a 53-0 win over Oklahoma State, finishing 10-0-0, and with a 466-51 finish in points. Only one of its ten opponents (Colorado) finished 1956 with a winning record. In Nashville, #2 Tennessee beat Vanderbilt 27-7 to close with a 10-0 record and a spot in the Sugar Bowl, where it would face 9-1-0 Baylor. #4 Georgia Tech closed with a 35-0 win at Georgia. Unbeaten and once-tied (9-0-1), #5 Texas A&M did win the Southwest Conference title, but the ban against post-season play sent the SWC runner-up, TCU, to the Cotton Bowl Classic instead.
Conference standings.
The following is an incomplete list of conference standings:
Other champions.
The Tennessee State Tigers (9-0-0) and the Florida A & M Rattlers (8-0-0) were considered to be the #1 and #2 teams "among the nation's Negro grid powers". The teams from the two historically black universities played at the Orange Bowl stadium in Miami, which hosted the Orange Blossom Classic as well as the New Year's Day, historically white universities, Orange Bowl game. A crowd of 41,808 watched Tennessee State win 41-39.
Unbeaten Montana State University met Saint Joseph's College, Indiana in the Aluminum Bowl at Little Rock in the first playoff to determine the NAIA small college championship, and played to a scoreless tie. Both were declared champions, and a coin flip allowed St. Joseph's to have the trophy for six months, followed by Montana State.
Other schools that finished their seasons unbeaten and untied were Lenoir Rhyne College, the University of Wyoming, New Haven Teachers College, Hillsdale College, Central Michigan University, Kearney State College, Redlands College, Sam Houston State, Westminster College (Pennsylvania), St. Thomas (Minn.) College, Alfred University and Milton College (Wisconsin).
Bowl games.
Other bowl games played in 1956 were the Orange Blossom Classic (Tennessee State 41, Florida A&M 39); the Tangerine Bowl (Orlando) Mississippi Southern vs. West Texas State ; the Sun Bowl (El Paso) GWU vs. Texas Western; and the Aluminum Bowl (Little Rock), with unbeaten Montana State 10-0 vs. St. Joseph's College of Indiana. The Refrigerator Bowl (Evansville, IN) was Sam Houston State 27, Middle Tennessee State 13.

Frank Oceak

Frank John Oceak (September 8, 1912 – March 19, 1983) was an American infielder and manager in minor league baseball and a coach in Major League Baseball for 11 seasons between and . A trusted confidant of four-time Pittsburgh Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh, Oceak was coaching at third base on October 13, 1960, during Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, when Pirate second baseman Bill Mazeroski hit his dramatic walk-off home run to clinch the Series against the New York Yankees. Oceak, wearing uniform #44, can be seen in many of the films and still photos of the historic event, celebrating with Mazeroski as he rounds third base and following him to home plate.
Frank Oceak was born in Pocahontas, Virginia. He batted and threw right-handed, and stood tall and weighed . Primarily a second baseman and shortstop, Oceak spent his entire playing career (1932–1940; 1942–1943; 1946–1947) in the lower minor leagues, briefly as a member of the Yankees' farm system. He became a player-manager at age 25 in 1938 with the Lafayette White Sox of the Class D Evangeline League — which was, despite its nickname, an affiliate of the St. Louis Browns. Two years later, as manager of the Beaver Falls Browns of the Class D Pennsylvania State Association, Oceak was suspended by Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis for the entire 1941 season for an assault on an umpire. However, Oceak resumed his playing and managing careers in 1942 with the Oil City Oilers of the PSA, his first assignment in the Pirates' organization, where he would spend most of the rest of his baseball life.
The bulk of his managing career, as in his playing days, took place in the lower minors, until 1957 when he was named skipper of the Columbus Jets of the Triple-A International League, one of the Pirates' two top-tier farm clubs. The following season, he was named to Murtaugh's coaching staff, serving for seven seasons as the Bucs' third base coach before Murtaugh resigned because of ill health at the close of the campaign. Oceak then spent one season, , with the Cincinnati Reds as a coach under Dick Sisler before returning to Pittsburgh as a minor league manager at the Class A and Double-A levels from 1966–1969.
In , Murtaugh returned to the dugout as manager of the Pirates, and Oceak rejoined him as third-base coach. He served through another world championship with the 1971 Pirates. When Murtaugh retired in the days after the 1971 World Series, Oceak stayed on for one more season as a coach under Bill Virdon before leaving baseball. He died in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, at the age of 70.
His career record as a minor league manager was 1,285 victories, and 1,386 defeats (.481).

18th Military Police Brigade (United States)

The 18th Military Police Brigade is a military police brigade of the United States Army based in Sembach, Germany, with subordinate battalions and companies stationed throughout Germany. It provides law enforcement and force protection duties to United States Army Europe.
Activated during the Vietnam War, the Brigade oversaw all Military Police operations in the country for a large portion of the conflict, undertaking a wide variety of missions throughout the country and providing command and control for other military police groups in the region. After Vietnam, the Brigade deployed units to several other operations, namely Operation Desert Storm and Operation Provide Comfort. The brigade itself also deployed to Kosovo, supporting many of the units operating there attempting to settle unrest in the area due to the 1999 Bosnian War.
The brigade has also seen multiple deployments in the War on Terrorism to Iraq. Its primary responsibilities have been to train and equip the national Iraqi Police forces. The Brigade recently returned from its third deployment to Iraq, after serving for 15 months in the Baghdad area.
Organization.
The 18th Military Police Brigade is a subordinate unit of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command and United States Army Europe. The brigade is headquartered in Sembach, Germany. The brigade has these subordinate units:
The Brigade is modular in nature, allowing it to take on additional units when deployed. Normally the Brigade only deploys with its Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC); organic battalions and companies normally don't deploy with the HHC.
History.
Vietnam War.
Members of the Headquarters and Headquarters detachment deployed to Vung Tau, Republic of Vietnam on 7 September 1966. 
On 26 September 1966, the Brigade assumed operational control over all non-divisional military police units in the Republic of Vietnam. The Brigade was composed of three major subordinate elements; the 16th Military Police Group at Nha Trang, and the 89th Military Police Group and 8th Military Police Group (Criminal Investigation) at Long Binh.
The 16th and 89th Military Police Groups were composed of seven military police battalions, containing a mixture of military police and infantry companies. The units were stationed throughout every corps tactical zone in the Republic of Vietnam, ranging from Da Nang in the north to Soc Trang in the south. The total strength of the Brigade numbered more than 5,000 personnel.
Members of the Brigade performed a wide variety of missions including evacuation of prisoners of war, security of vessels and ports, convoy escort, security of vital installations and VIPs, maintenance of discipline, law and order, and direct support to combat operations. During the Tet Offensive, the 716th MP Battalion fought off a resolute Viet Cong unit determined to take over the US Embassy, while other 18th Brigade units performed similar duties in the Mekong Delta, Bien Hoa, the Central Highlands, and throughout the RVN. The Brigade completed its service in Vietnam and was deactivated on 20 March 1973 in Oakland, California.
Cold War era.
The Brigade was redesignated on 16 August 1985 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 18th Military Police Brigade and activated in Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany. During 1990–1991, battalions from the Brigade deployed to support VII Corps in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, and V Corps in Operation Provide Comfort. Elements of the Brigade have also deployed to support Operation Provide Promise and Operation Joint Endeavor in the former Yugoslavia.
Demonstrating its rapid deployability and ability to support V Corps and United States Army Europe contingency operations, every unit within the 18th Military Police Brigade deployed to the Balkans in 1999. The 92nd Military Police Company, followed by the 527th Military Police Company deployed to Sarajevo, Bosnia to provide security in support of SFOR. The 615th Military Police Company deployed to Albania in April in support of Task Force Hawk. The Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 793rd Military Police Battalion and 127th and 630th Military Police Companies deployed in July to Kosovo in support of Task Force Falcon. The Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 18th Military Police Brigade deployed in July to Sarajevo in support of Task Force Summit. The HHD, 709th Military Police Battalion and 92nd and 212th Military Police Company deployed in November to Kosovo in support of Task Force Falcon. While in Kosovo, the battalions were the first ever Military Police battalions to conduct joint peacekeeping operations in general support of Russian, Greek, Jordanian, and Polish maneuver battalions.
War on Terrorism.
In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I, the 18th Military Police Brigade crossed into Iraq on 22 March 2003. During its year of deployment, the brigade established Prisoner of War holding areas for over 3,600 Iraqi prisoners and conducted main supply route patrolling over 2,500 kilometers in southern Iraq. The Brigade entered Baghdad in April 2003 and began establishing the new Iraqi Police Service and rebuilding Iraqi police stations. From the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom until February 2004 the Brigade provided command and control for seven Military Police battalions, one Mechanized Infantry battalion, 30 Military Police companies, and two Law and Order detachments. The Brigade’s MPs conducted over 24,000 combat patrols, apprehended over 2,400 criminals, confiscated 7,500 illegal weapons, and trained over 10,000 Iraqi police officers. During their deployment, the Brigade recovered several precious artifacts, such as the Warka Mask, which was recovered on 23 September 2003. The brigade returned to Sandhofen in 2004 only to return to Iraq in 2007.
The 127th and 630th Military Police Companies began serving in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II in mid-2007. The 127th Company served in Iskandariyah, on patrol operations with local police. In November 2007 the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the brigade and the 793rd Military Police Battalion deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III. The brigade replaced the 89th Military Police Brigade which was assigned there previously. The transition ceremony for this command was held on 30 October as 100 soldiers from the brigade's headquarters took charge of the 89th's area of responsibility. They deployed to the Baghdad area, and took responsibility for the training of the Iraqi Police. The brigade is supporting Iraqi police logistics, personnel management, maintenance, budget, operations, training, leadership and judicial integration. Other training for Police units included proper search of vehicles, providing medical assistance to Iraqi civilians, as well as expanding the number of Iraqi police and improving their training overall. In theater, the brigade commanded over 5,000 soldiers. Units that the Brigade assumed control of included the 153rd Military Police Company of the Delaware Army National Guard and the 223rd Military Police Company of the Kentucky Army National Guard. The brigade worked with the 35th Engineer Brigade to finish construction on the Furat Training Facility, the primary training facility for thousands of Iraqi police. The project was completed in February 2008. In August 2008, the brigade began facilitating the transition for the 8th Military Police Brigade, which was set to replace the 18th MP Brigade when its 15-month tour of duty ended. The brigade cased its colors on 2 December 2008 and began redeploying back to its home bases. The 18th MP brigade trained 20,000 Iraqi police during its deployment, and lost 15 soldiers.
In addition to the brigade's support to the War on Terrorism, many soldiers of the brigade continually conduct law enforcement and force protection duties in communities located throughout the central region of Europe.

Will Dockery

Will Dockery (1865–1936) built from scratch the Dockery Plantation, the famous home of such original Delta blues musicians as Charley Patton, Robert Johnson, Son House, Howlin' Wolf, Willie Brown, Tommy Johnson, and Pops Staples.
Plantation.
Dockery's parents left the Carolinas sometime before the American Civil War and settled in Mississippi as farmers, but were left poor by the war's end. Dockery was born in Love, Mississippi, and went on to graduate from the University of Mississippi in 1885. He left the family farm and purchased, with a $1000 gift from his grandmother, tracts of forest and marshland outside of Cleveland, Mississippi in the Mississippi Delta between the Yazoo River and the Sunflower River. First he went into the lumber business, cutting trees and building a sawmill. As he made more money he acquired more land; realizing that the bottom soil was rich, he cleared the trees, drained the marshes of malaria-carrying mosquitoes and began to plant cotton. It subsequently became known that Dockery needed manual labor, and he was willing to pay for it, so laborers flocked there. Eventually, Will Dockery built a large cotton gin, a post office and a company store which produced its own money. By the 1930s, Dockery plantation covered of rich fertile river delta lowland. Will Dockery earned a reputation for treating his workers fairly.
Over the years, black laborers began to migrate to the Dockery Plantation, to work in the fields and become tenant farmers or sharecroppers, a system in which they leased land to cultivate, paying the owner a share of the crop. The families lived on their land and grew their own gardens. Often peripatetic blues musicians were attracted there for itinerant work and they lived in what were called the "quarters" for bachelors, known for the partying and drinking going on there. Here musicians, often drunk, played their music far into the night. The guitar was particularly suited to the rural Mississippi Delta musician.
The Mississippi Blues Commission placed a historic marker at the site of the plantation in recognition of its enormous importance in the development of the Mississippi blues.
The blues.
Although the complete history will never be known, there is a central theme to the development of what is known as the blues, and that is the plantation that Will Dockery built outside of Cleveland. Although Dockery was unaware of the music his laborers played in their quarters at "house parties" during their off hours, his plantation provided a particularly fertile atmosphere for musicians to gather and play their music while others listened and danced. It is difficult to know what Mississippi music would have emerged without the musical mix of Tommy Johnson, Charley Patton, and Robert Johnson.
Historic marker.
A marker designating Dockery Plantation as a site on the Mississippi Blues Trail is an acknowledgment of the important contribution of the plantation to the development of the blues in Mississippi.
The marker was placed in Cleveland, Mississippi. Governor Haley Barbour stated:

Don Stevenson (musician)

Don Stevenson (born October 15, 1941, Seattle, Washington) is the drummer and a singer and songwriter for Moby Grape, a band which was formed in San Francisco in 1966 and continues to perform occasionally today.
History.
Don Stevenson first obtained local recognition as a member of The Frantics, a band based in Seattle and including fellow Washingtonian Jerry Miller (from Tacoma) on guitar. The band relocated to San Francisco in 1966 and formed the nucleus of what became Moby Grape.
Stevenson's position in Moby Grape is similar to, but predates that of Don Henley of The Eagles, in that Stevenson was a drummer and a principal songwriter and lead singer. With Jerry Miller, Stevenson is the co-writer of three of Moby Grape's best known songs, "Hey Grandma" and "8:05", both from Moby Grape's self-titled first album (1967) and "Murder In My Heart for The Judge", from the Wow album (1968). The latter song was covered by both Three Dog Night and Lee Michaels, while Robert Plant covered "8:05" and The Move covered "Hey Grandma". He continued to write with Jerry Miller during the course of Moby Grape's four albums with Columbia Records (1967-1969). In later years, such as on Moby Grape's "Legendary Grape" album (1989) and beginning with "20 Granite Creek" (1971), Stevenson contributed songs that were solely composed.
Stevenson is the only member of Moby Grape to continue in music while at the same time developing occupational interests outside of music. Stevenson has become well known in real estate circles, such as in relation to the sale of time shares in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, a resort location where he maintains a residence.
In 2007, Stevenson appeared with Moby Grape at the 40th anniversary San Francisco "Summer of Love" reunion. In 2010, Stevenson performed with Jerry Miller and Omar Spence (son of deceased Moby Grape bandmate Skip Spence) at the South by Southwest festival. Stevenson shared lead vocals with Miller and performed a number of Moby Grape "classics", in addition to new material developed and recorded with Miller in 2009.
Despite success as a singer, songwriter and musician, Stevenson was, until 2010, the only member of Moby Grape not to have released a solo album. In late 2010, his first solo album was released. As described by noted critic David Fricke, "(t)he music is an engaging blend of country, blues and R&B, like Jerry Garcia's solo records, but with a rougher-timber feel in the singing and playing, plus Miller contributing guitars and harmonies."

Weesatche, Texas

Weesatche is an unincorporated community in northern Goliad County, Texas, United States. It lies along State Highway 119 north of the city of Goliad, the county seat of Goliad County. Its elevation is 233 feet (71 m). Although Weesatche is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 77993. The community is part of the Victoria, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area.
History.
Weesatche was founded around the year 1850 under the name of Middletown, being halfway between Clinton and Goliad, and its post office was established on 1855-11-22. However, confusion with a Middletown in Comal County led locals to rename the community after the sweet acacia tree; the community's name is a corruption of the plant's alternate name, "huisache". A post office under the name of Weesatche was opened in May 1860; although it closed during the Civil War, it was restored in 1870.
Public services.
Local children have attended the schools of the Goliad ISD since Weesatche's schools were consolidated into it in 1963. The community has a volunteer fire department.

Bellamy Road

The Bellamy Road was the first major U.S. federal highway in early territorial Florida.
In 1824, only five years after Florida became a United States territory (and the same year that Alachua County itself was created), Congress authorized the construction of its first federal highway. It would be a wide road, connecting Pensacola to St. Augustine. The Florida Territorial Council commissioned John Bellamy, a Monticello plantation owner, to build Bellamy Road. The project took two years to complete, at a cost of $20,000. The route would become known as the Bellamy Avenue. It was a major highway until the Civil War, when other roads became preferred routes. A few of the places it passed were the town of Traxler, the Santa Fe Taloca Spanish Mission, and what would become Newnansville.
U.S. Army Capt. Daniel Burch had the contract for the entire job and put Bellamy in charge of the $13,500 section from Picolata on the St. Johns River to the Ochlockonee River. To survey the route, Burch with a detachment marched from Pensacola beginning Oct. 22, 1823 and reached St. Augustine Nov. 25, 1823, a distance of . Bellamy used his own equipment and slaves, and completed his portion of the road in May 1826. Construction was delayed by heavy rains and Indian attacks.
Tree stumps were cut within one foot of the ground to allow wagon axles to clear them. Sometimes one lone stump would be a bit higher and would strike the floorboard of a wagon, sometimes jarring it completely apart, resulting in the road receiving the ominous nickname "Stump-Knocker". The roadbed was typically not built up over wet areas. Instead, logs were placed in the path that resulted in a frequently bumpy ride.
The original road crossed Alachua County along the route of the Old Mission Trail, a trail widely used by Indians and Franciscan missionaries, running from near Santa Fe Lake through a swampy, forested hammock between present-day O'Leno State Park and River Rise Preserve State Park. It is here where the Santa Fe River disappears underground and travels three miles (5 km) before re-appearing. This area became a perfect natural crossing for the road. It was the first Federal highway in Florida, and opened the interior of north Florida to settlers.
The Congressional Act read:
"Be it enacted that the President of the United States is hereby authorized to cause to be opened, in the Territory of Florida, a public road from Pensacola to St. Augustine, commencing at Deer Point, on the Bay of Pensacola, and pursuing the old Indian Trail to the Cow Ford on the Choctawatchy River; thence direct to the Natural Bridge on the Econfinan River; thence to the Ochese Bluff on the Apalachicola River; thence in the most direct practicable to the site of Fort St. Louis; thence as nearly as practicable, on the old Spanish road to St. Augustine crossing the St. Johns River at Picolata; which road shall be plainly and distinctly marked and shall be the width of twenty-five feet."
Remnants of the old sand road are used today and part of the Bellamy Road forms the county line between the northwest part of Putnam County and the southwest part of Clay County.

2003 Philadelphia Eagles season

The 2003 Philadelphia Eagles season was their 71st in the league. They matched their previous season's record, going 12–4, however, they were again upset in the NFC Conference Championship. The team made the playoffs for the fourth straight year, won its third straight NFC East division title, and had the NFC's top record for the second straight season.
After losing their final game in Veterans Stadium to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2002 NFC Championship, Philadelphia looked to turn the page with the opening of brand-new Lincoln Financial Field, but the stadium got an inaspicious start when the Eagles dropped their first two games there, including a season-opening loss to Tampa Bay. A crushing loss to the New England Patriots left the Eagles 0–2 and expected to compete for the Super Bowl, at a precarious 2–3, and it looked to be 2–4 before Brian Westbrook returned a punt for a touchdown to shock the New York Giants in the closing minutes of their Week 7 contest. The play turned the Eagles' season around and they won their next nine games, finishing with a 12–4 record. In the playoffs, the Eagles needed a miracle conversion on 4th and 26 to defeat the Green Bay Packers, but the magic had run out by the next week and the team dropped a 14–3 decision to the Carolina Panthers at Lincoln Financial Field in the NFC Championship.
A preseason holdout by running back Duce Staley resulted in a running back by committee situation by Staley, Westbrook, and Correll Buckhalter. The trio rushed for a combined 1,613 yards and 20 touchdowns and became known as "The Three-Headed Monster." The rushing attack, which also benefited from 355 rushing yard and three touchdowns by quarterback Donovan McNabb, carried the offense, which featured a weak receiving corps that did not record a touchdown until Week 9. There were calls early in the season to replace McNabb with backup A.J. Feeley, but McNabb would find his rhythm and enjoy a great season. The defense weathered early injuries to defensive backs Bobby Taylor and Brian Dawkins to eventually surrender the seventh-fewest points in the league. Cornerback Troy Vincent, in his final season as an Eagle, was elected to the Pro Bowl. The weakness in the defense would be in stopping the run, something the team struggled with even at the height of their nine-game winning streak.
Regular season.
Week 1: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who ruined the Eagles' bid for a Super Bowl the previous season by defeating them in their final game at Veteran's Stadium, spoiled the opening of Lincoln Financial Field by thoroughly dominating the Eagles in a 17–0 shutout. A big run by James Thrash gave the Eagles a chance at an early field goal, but head coach Andy Reid tried a fake field goal to rookie tight end L. J. Smith, who let the ball go off of his fingertips. Early in the second quarter, Tampa Bay put up a field goal for a 3–0 lead, while the Eagles looked out of sync. A touchdown pass to Joe Jurevicius, who had made a huge reception in the 2002 NFC Championship, made it 10–0. Jurevicius caught another short touchdown on the next drive, which ate half of the fourth quarter. Brian Dawkins and Bobby Taylor both had to leave the game with injuries.
Week 2: vs. New England Patriots.
The situation went from bad to worse as the Eagles suffered a second straight disastrous loss, again at their new home. The defense, already ravaged by injuries, fought hard and held the New England Patriots to only a first-quarter field goal. Duce Staley scored Philadelphia's first points of the season early in the second quarter, but two Tom Brady touchdown passes in the second quarter made it 17–7 Patriots at halftime. Brady found Deion Branch for a touchdown in the third quarter before Eagles' placekicker David Akers booted a 57-yarder, his career high. Tedy Bruschi intercepted Donovan McNabb for a touchdown to break it open at 31–10. In total, the offense gave up six turnovers and seven sacks.
Week 4: at Buffalo Bills.
After two devastating losses to start the season, the Eagles used an early bye week to regroup and defeated the Buffalo Bills a 23–13. The Eagles methodically built a 16–0 lead through the first three quarters. Correll Buckhalter scored a short touchdown in the first quarter, and David Akers added three field goals. In the final period, Drew Bledsoe rallied Buffalo to two straight touchdowns, cutting the lead to 16–13. However, Brian Westbrook broke a tackle at the line of scrimmage and charged through the middle for a 62-yard touchdown run to seal the deal. Donovan McNabb, nursing a sore thumb on his throwing hand, threw for 172 yards and rushed for 47, while the defense played a solid game, especially in the first half.
Week 5: vs Washington Redskins.
Coming off a crucial win at Buffalo, the Eagles battled their division-rival Washington Redskins to a 27–25 victory. David Akers opened the scoring with a 52-yard field goal, and a short touchdown pass from Donovan McNabb to fullback Jon Ritchie gave Philadelphia a 10–0 lead in the second quarter. Redskin quarterback Patrick Ramsey rushed for a touchdown to cut into the Eagles' lead, and the teams traded field goals to make it 13–10 Eagles at halftime. In the third quarter, the Redskins tied the game on a field goal. The Eagles defense restored the lead when defensive lineman Darwin Walker hit Ramsey as he was throwing, flinging the ball into the air and into the arms of teammate N.D. Kalu who returned it 15 yards for the touchdown. After another Washington field goal in the fourth quarter, Brian Westbrook scored on 19-yard run with three minutes left to play, which put Philadelphia up 27–16 and appeared to end the game, as in Buffalo the previous week. The Redskins instead mounted a furious rally, with kicker John Hall booting a 53-yard field goal, the special teams recovering an onside kick, and Ramsey firing a 32-yard touchdown pass to Darnerien McCants with seconds remaining. However, the Eagles broke up the two-point conversion to preserve Philadelphia's first victory in Lincoln Financial Field. The defense turned in a relatively strong performance despite the absence of Pro Bowlers Brian Dawkins, Troy Vincent, and Bobby Taylor.
Week 6: at Dallas Cowboys.
The 2–2 Eagles met the 3–1 Dallas Cowboys and fell to them 23–21, their first loss to Dallas since 1999. Andy Reid tried an opening kickoff onsides kick, which had helped spark the Eagles' 2000 season opening route of Dallas, but the Cowboys' new coach, Bill Parcells, was not fooled and the gamble blew up in Philadelphia's face. Randal Williams fielded the bouncing kick and raced into the end zone untouched in three seconds – the fastest touchdown in NFL history. Brian Westbrook's five-yard touchdown run in the second quarter tied the score, but Billy Cundiff kicked a field goal just before halftime to make it 10–7 Dallas. Troy Hambrick finished a third quarter Dallas drive with a one-yard touchdown to open a 17–7 Cowboy lead. A 52-yard catch-and-run by Duce Staley on the Eagles' ensuing drive brought Philadelphia within three points, but the Cowboys answered back with another field goal. With less than five minutes left to play, Correll Buckhalter broke free for a 20-yard touchdown run, giving Philadelphia a 21–20 lead. A long kick return helped set up Dallas' go-ahead field goal. Donovan McNabb, who struggled mightily throughout the game with a thumb injury, could not advance the team into field goal range after James Thrash returned the kickoff to midfield. Westbrook, Staley, and Buckhalter combined for over 100 rushing yards and three touchdowns. The loss dropped Philadelphia to 2–3 and a repeat of a division title appeared in doubt.
Week 7: at New York Giants.
Brian Westbrook delivered the play of the year for the Eagles, returning a punt with less than two minutes left to win the game 14–10 over the New York Giants. In the first quarter, Westbrook's five-yard touchdown run (his fourth in four games) gave Philadelphia a 7–0 lead. New York got a field goal in the second quarter and a Jeremy Shockey touchdown reception in the third to take a 10–7 lead. It could have been more, as they drove inside the Philadelphia 40-yard line seven times, but usually squandered their opportunities. Meanwhile, the Eagles' offense was virtually non-existent throughout the game. Donovan McNabb had his worst game as a professional, only completing 9-of-23 passes for a meager 64 yards. Inside the two-minute warning, the Giants forced the Eagles to burn their timeouts, then punted to give it back to the dormant Philadelphia offense and end the game. However, Westbrook fielded the Jeff Feagles punt on a bounce, broke through the first few defenders, and began to race down the left sideline and into the end zone, stealing the victory and saving the Eagles' season. The 84-yard punt return was a turning point for Philadelphia, saving them from falling to 2–4 and propelling them on a what would be a nine-game winning streak.
Week 8: vs New York Jets.
A week after the so-called "Miracle at the Meadowlands III", the Eagles defeated the Big Apple's other team, the New York Jets, 24–17 in a sea-saw game. After a 30-yard field goal gave New York the first points, Correll Buckhalter scored on a six-yard run to take the lead. Santana Moss hauled in a 60-yard bomb from Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde to go up 10–7. In the second quarter, Buckhalter scored his second touchdown, from seven yards out, to retake the lead for Philadelphia. For the Jets, quarterback Chad Pennington, returning from a preseason injury, took over midgame as planned. After a Donovan McNabb interception in the third quarter, Pennington drove his team down the field and LaMont Jordan finished the drive with a touchdown run and a 17–14 New York lead. McNabb rebounded and led the Eagles to a go-ahead touchdown – a four-yard pass to fullback Jon Ritchie. A big tackle by Darwin Walker on LaMont Jordan on 4th and 1 led to Philadelphia's final points – a field goal by David Akers. McNabb passed for 141 yards and a touchdown, an improvement over his dismal performance against the Giants. Buckhalter had his second-career 100-yard game, along with two scores. The Eagles improved to 4–3 and were now only one game out of first place.
Week 9: at Atlanta Falcons.
In Week 9, the Eagles travelled to the Georgia Dome and defeated the lowly Atlanta Falcons 23–16. A turnover on the opening kickoff led to a short field goal for David Akers. Following a Lito Sheppard interception in the red zone, the Donovan McNabb connected with Freddie Mitchell for a 39-yard touchdown pass – the first to a wide receiver all season for the Eagles. The second quarter belonged to Atlanta, as they scored thirteen unanswered points and went into halftime ahead 13–10. Philadelphia took care of business in the second half, tying the game on a field goal, while the defense stifled the Falcon offense, which switched quarterbacks in the third quarter. A pair of big catches by rookie tight end L.J. Smith powered a drive that ended in a Duce Staley touchdown run and a Philadelphia lead. The teams traded field goals later in the fourth quarter, but the defense kept Atlanta out of the end zone. McNabb had his first 300-yard passing game in two years, Correll Buckhalter rushed for 92 yards, and L.J. Smith had a breakout performance with six catches for 97 yards. The Eagles went to 5–3 and suddenly had three wins in a row.
Week 10: at Green Bay Packers.
Playing in a rainy Lambeau Field on Monday Night Football, Donovan McNabb led the Eagles to a last-minute victory over Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers. Both offenses struggled on a wet field in the first half. David Akers and Ryan Longwell each missed field goals, and the only points of the half would be a 24-yard touchdown reception by Packer halfback Ahman Green. The Eagles got on the board with a short Akers field goal after a long drive in the third quarter. Donovan McNabb then scored on a one-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter to give Philadelphia a 10–7 lead. However, Ahman Green broke a 45-yard run to the end zone that put Green Bay back on top 14–10. The Philadelphia defense came up with a big stop to give McNabb and the offense one last chance with 2:43 left in the game. McNabb marshalled the team downfield and with less than thirty seconds remaining, he hit Todd Pinkston in the end zone with the game-winning touchdown pass. The Packers struggled to hold onto the ball (Favre especially), and turned it over three times compared to zero turnovers for the Eagles. Ahman Green rushed for 192 yards in defeat (Green Bay rushed for 241 as a team). The suddenly red-hot Eagles were now 6–3 on the season.
Week 11: vs New York Giants.
Playing at home, the Eagles dominated the New York Giants in an easy 28–10 route. The Giants scored first on a short field goal, but the Eagles answered back late in the first quarter when Donovan McNabb drove the team down the field, setting up a one-yard touchdown by Correll Buckhalter. Brian Westbrook scored on a 29-yard pass play in the second quarter and a four-yard run in the third quarter as Philadelphia went ahead 21–3. Tiki Barber, who rushed for over 100 yards, scored in the fourth quarter, but Westbrook took in his third touchdown on a short pass to end the scoring. McNabb had one of his best games, completing 24 of 30 passes for 314 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Westbrook, developing a reputation as a 'Giant killer,' had 108 all-purpose yards to go along with his three touchdowns. The win moved the Eagles to 7–3 and virtually knocked the reeling Giants out of contention, while A Dallas loss allowed the Eagles to move into a tie for first place in the NFC East.
Week 12: vs New Orleans Saints.
In a game that featured 272 penalty yards, the Eagles topped the 5–5 New Orleans Saints 33–20. Todd Pinkston pulled down a 48-yard bomb to open the game, and the drive ended in a chip-shot David Akers field goal. Brian Westbrook scored on a 15-yard run and it 10–0 Eagles. Correll Buckhalter scored in the second quarter as Philadelphia pulled away. Saints quarterback Aaron Brooks completed a touchdown pass later in the quarter, but Akers kicked another field goal to end the half 20–7 Philadelphia. After another Akers field goal, Deuce McAllister broke a 76-yard touchdown run to narrow the score to 23–14. The Eagles, who moved the ball easily all game, responded with another field goal and a Donovan McNabb to fullback Jon Ritchie touchdown pass to open a 33–14 lead. McAllister scored again, but the conversion failed and Philadelphia had won its sixth straight. McNabb threw for 259 yards and did not allow an interception for the fourth consecutive week. Duce Staley, McNabb, Westbrook, and Buckhalter combined for 201 rushing yards to counter the 177 rushing yards by McAllister.
Week 13: at Carolina Panthers.
The 8–3 Eagles and 8–3 Carolina Panthers squared off in a key battle for NFC supremacy and the Eagles emerged with the win. A rare Donovan McNabb interception allowed Carolina to score a quick field goal. But he rebounded, leading the Eagles on a 10-play drive capped by a touchdown plunge by Duce Staley. In the second quarter, David Akers connected for his first field goal. He was good from 48-yards out in the third quarter to put Philadelphia up 13–3. Carolina's offense then struck when Jake Delhomme found Steve Smith for a 24-yard touchdown pass to make it 13–10 going into the final quarter. A long drive by McNabb ended in a big Akers field goal. Then, the defense provided a big play when a blitz by linebacker Nate Wayne caused a fumble, recovered by Darwin Walker. This set up a McNabb 10-yard touchdown pass to James Thrash, who was pushed into the end zone by Carolina defenders trying to tackle him. The two-point conversion by Philadelphia failed. Delhomme completed another touchdown, this one to Muhsin Muhammad, but kicker John Kasay missed the extra point, leaving the score 22–16. Trying to burn the clock, McNabb slowly marched the Eagles down the field and Akers came on to kick his fourth field goal, giving the Eagles a nine-point lead. While Akers was 4-for-4 on field goals and won NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, Kasay was 1-for-4 with a missed extra point. Staley, Correll Buckhalter, and Brian Westbrook combined for 118 rushing yards, while McNabb was efficient, completing 18-of-26 passes. The big win moved Philadelphia to 9–3, with the top record in their conference.
Week 14: vs Dallas Cowboys.
In another key game, with the NFC East essentially at stake, the Eagles crushed the Bill Parcells-led Dallas Cowboys 36–10. Dallas tried early to establish their running game, and late in the first quarter, they scored the game's first points on a field goal. Philadelphia evened the score in the second quarter, then took the lead when Donovan McNabb guided the offense down the field and tossed a short pass to Brian Westbrook, who broke several tackles on his 16-yard scamper to the end zone. Dallas responded with a long drive that ended in a Quincy Carter touchdown pass, sending the game to halftime tied 10–10. The Eagles would own the second half. Sheldon Brown picked off Carter, setting up a shovel pass touchdown to Duce Staley. Later, a botched shotgun ended with Carter kicking the ball out of the endzone on an intentional safety as Philadelphia assumed a 19–10 lead. Another interception, this one by Bobby Taylor, resulted in tight end L.J. Smith's first career touchdown reception. David Akers added a field goal in the fourth quarter, and a 64-yard burst through the middle by Correll Buckhalter in the final minutes made it 36–10. The defense, especially the pass defense, absolutely shut Dallas down in the final two quarters. McNabb finished with 248 passing yards and three touchdowns and Buckhalter had 115 yards on 13 carries. The Eagles record went to 10–3 and the team had all but wrapped up their third straight division title.
Week 15: at Miami Dolphins.
On a Monday Night Football matchup in Miami, the Eagles had roughly 20,000 fans who made the trip in attendance as they beat the 8–4 Dolphins in a shootout. A 59-yard bomb to Todd Pinkston opened the game, and two plays later, Brian Westbrook danced through the defense and into the end zone on a 21-yard run for a quick touchdown. The Miami Dolphins answered with a touchdown, and on the Eagles' ensuing possession, Donovan McNabb took it in himself for a score. Quickly, the Dolphins came back with another touchdown, but Philadelphia retook the lead when Freddie Mitchell completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Westbrook, who beat linebacker Zach Thomas, on a trick play. The teams traded field goals before halftime, and in the third quarter a rushing touchdown by Ricky Williams tied the game at 24–24. In the fourth quarter, Correll Buckhalter, on a short sweep, dove over the pylon for the go-ahead touchdown. The Eagles would drain the clock on their next drive and eventually added a field goal to take a ten-point lead and put the game away. The Eagles scored four touchdowns on a defense that had only given up 17 all season. Their record improved to 11–3 and their winning streak was now at nine games.
Week 16: vs San Francisco 49ers.
A home overtime loss to the San Francisco 49ers snapped the Eagles' nine-game winning streak. A bad snap led to an early field goal miss for San Francisco, but after an Eagles 3-and-out, the 49ers took back over and scored on a 15-yard screen pass to Kevan Barlow. The defense then tightened and creating a turnover that led to a short Duce Staley touchdown run. Todd Pinkston fumbled away a touchdown out of the endzone after catching a long pass from Donovan McNabb. The Eagles took a 14–7 lead on another short-yardage Staley touchdown. A 33-yard pass from Garcia to Brandon Lloyd tied the score at halftime. Before the half was over, 49ers star Terrell Owens had broken his collarbone, and Eagles starting linebacker Carlos Emmons had broken his leg – a big blow for the playoffs. Brian Westbrook returned a punt 81 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter – bringing back recent memories of his big touchdown in the Meadowlands. San Francisco answered with two fields goals and a touchdown by Barlow (followed by a successful two-point conversion) to take a 28–21 lead. McNabb rallied the Eagles, driving them down the field (with Freddie Mitchell coming up with a big 4th down reception). McNabb beat the blitz and Pinkston made a backward diving catch to tie the game with a minute left. In overtime, Tony Parrish picked off McNabb and returned it inside the Eagles 5-yard line. Todd Peterson kicked the game winner and the Eagles' streak ended. McNabb had two interceptions and David Akers missed two field goals. Pinkston had 121 receiving yards and a touchdown, but Barlow rushed for 154 for San Francisco.
Week 17: at Washington Redskins.
Playing on a Saturday night to clinch the NFC East title, the Eagles walloped the Washington Redskins 31–7. Donovan McNabb called for a quick snap and threw the ball to Chad Lewis for a touchdown when he noticed Washington had left him uncovered for Philadelphia's first score. A 96-yard drive, the longest of the season, ended with McNabb bootlegging it into the end zone as Philadelphia took control early. Freddie Mitchell made it 21–0 Philadelphia with a touchdown reception later in the second quarter. Rock Cartwright scored a one-yard touchdown a few minutes later, but that was all Washington would get. Correll Buckhalter added a touchdown and David Akers kicked a field goal as Philadelphia cruised 31–7. McNabb passed for 242 yards and three touchdowns, Todd Pinkston had 74 receiving yards, and the defense recorded five sacks. However, Brian Westbrook, one of the top weapons of the Philadelphia offense, tore his biceps muscle and was lost for the playoffs.
Playoffs.
Divisional Round: vs Green Bay Packers.
In what became known as the "4th and 26 game", the Eagles came back and beat the Green Bay Packers in one of the most dramatic playoff games in their history. Inspired after the death of his father, Brett Favre led the Packers to victories in their final four games to win the NFC North Division, then led the team into overtime against the Seattle Seahawks in a game eventually won on an interception return by former Eagle Al Harris. The Packers were proclaimed by experts as the "team of destiny" and had the sympathy of the nation. The Eagles, who finished 12–4, had ended the season with nine wins in ten games, but had some injuries on defense and were without running back Brian Westbrook for the playoffs. On a wall in the Eagles' locker room, it was written, "If they're the team of destiny, where does that leave us?"
The Eagles offense came out sluggishly, failing to record a first down on their first three drives. One play after Donovan McNabb turned the ball over on a fumble, Brett Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 40-yard touchdown pass after Ferguson had burnt the Philadelphia coverage. A 44-yard scramble by McNabb got Philadelphia into the Green Bay red zone, but David Akers missed a 33-yard field goal. Favre promptly marched the Packers down the field and found Ferguson again for a 7-yard touchdown and it was 14–0 Packers as the first quarter came to a close. In the second quarter, the Eagles went to the air and McNabb tossed a big 45-yard pass to Todd Pinkston, then fired a quick 7-yard touchdown pass to Duce Staley to cut the Packer lead in half. Late in the half, the defense came up with a goal line stand after Green Bay had 1st and goal from the four-yard line. On 4th and 1, Packer running back Ahman Green was stuffed and the game went to halftime 14–7.
On their two possessions in the third quarter, the Packers got inside the Philadelphia 40-yard line, but they failed to score both times. The Eagles, again attacking through air, drove it into the Green Bay red zone. On the first play of the fourth quarter, McNabb scrambled to the right and found Pinkston in the front right corner of the end zone for the game-tying touchdown. Favre completed a 44-yard bomb to Javon Walker to get inside the Eagles 10-yard line a few minutes later, but the Packers settled for a field goal and went up 17–14. With 8:44 left to play, the Packers took back over and began a long drive that drained the clock. The drive stalled at the Philadelphia 41-yard line, and the Packers decided to punt on 4th and 1 with just over two minutes left in regulation. The Eagles took over and immediately Staley burst forward for 22 yards, but a costly sack and two incomplete passes left the Eagles at 4th and 26 from their own 26-yard line. On what looked to potentially be the final play of their season, McNabb fired a laser over the middle that Freddie Mitchell came down with for a 28-yard gain despite a hard shot from Marques Anderson and Darren Sharper at the Packers 47-yard line. Following a five-yard encroachment penalty on the Packers' Cletidus Hunt, McNabb completed another pass to Mitchell and a 10-yarder to Pinkston to get to the Packer 19-yard line. With seconds left in regulation, Akers booted the 33-yard field goal home and the game went to overtime. After a three-and-out by Philadelphia, Favre was chased on his first play and heaved the ball into the air, almost like a punt. Brian Dawkins caught the pass and the returned it well inside Packer territory. McNabb got the Eagles up to the Packer 13-yard line and Akers came on to kick the game-winner, sending Philadelphia to the NFC Championship and leaving Green Bay's "destiny" in ashes. McNabb had thrown for 248 yards and two scores, while also running 11 times for 107 yards. Pinkston caught 7 passes for 95 yards in one of the biggest games of his career. Ahman Green ran for 156 yards off of the Eagles defense.
NFC Championship: vs Carolina Panthers.
In a monumentally disappointing result for Philadelphia, the Eagles lost the NFC Championship 14–3 to the Carolina Panthers. It was their third straight championship game defeat, and second in a row at home. They had beaten the Panthers 25–16 in Week 13 in Carolina, but the Panthers' opportunistic defense disrupted the wounded Eagles offense, holding them to three points and dashing their hopes for a Super Bowl a week after the 4th and 26 miracle. The Panthers, just two years removed from a 1–15 season, went 11–5 in 2003, winning the NFC South. In the playoffs, they defeated Dallas 29–10 and beat the St. Louis Rams in double overtime on a 69-yard touchdown catch by Steve Smith.
Carolina drove into Philadelphia territory on their opening drive, but punted the ball away. Donovan McNabb marched the Eagles down the field, reaching the Carolina 32-yard line after a 23-yard catch and run by Correll Buckhalter. However, the drive stalled and the Eagles punted. The teams traded punts again, but early in the second quarter Jake Delhomme broke through and led the Panthers down the field, completing a 24-yard touchdown pass to Muhsin Muhammad on a badly thrown ball that somehow beat the Eagles' double coverage. McNabb responded with a long drive, but on 1st and 10 from the Carolina 23-yard line, he was knocked down by his own lineman being pushed back, and was hit by linebacker Greg Favors after he was down. The Eagles sideline pleaded for a late-hit call, but to no avail. McNabb returned after one play, and had a 10-yard completion to Freddie Mitchell (which was initially ruled a drop). This set up a 41-yard field goal by David Akers that made it 7–3. Philadelphia's final drive of the half was ended when rookie Ricky Manning Jr. picked off McNabb, who was visibly hurt. While the Eagles defense played well, the offense was stifled by four first half sacks.
With McNabb playing with torn cartilage in his ribs, the Eagles went to the ground, using Buckhalter and Duce Staley to drive into Carolina's red zone on their first drive of the third quarter. However, Ricky Manning Jr. stepped in front of a McNabb pass intended for Todd Pinkston and came away with his second interception, which proved to be tremendous blow. On Philadelphia's next possession, receiver James Thrash was hit as the ball arrived and Ricky Manning Jr. grabbed the deflection and returned it 13-yards to the Philadelphia 37-yard line, his third interception. DeShaun Foster helped power the ball to the Eagles' one-yard line, and on first and goal from there, he ran over linebacker Mark Simoneau as he pushed into the end zone. Now behind 14–3, Philadelphia's crippled offense was unable to pick up a first down the rest of the quarter. On the first drive of the fourth quarter, Koy Detmer finally came in to replace the injured McNabb. Detmer led the Eagles to the Panther 11-yard line, but he was then intercepted by Dan Morgan, ending the Eagles' final threat. Philadelphia got the ball back one final time, and as McNabb watched from the sidelines, could not get past midfield.
For the second year in a row, the Philadelphia fans were forced to watch another team celebrate on their field. The five sacks and four interceptions by Carolina's defense were devastating, while receivers Pinkston and Thrash were manhandled by the Panther secondary throughout the game. The injury to McNabb, on an offense already missing Brian Westbrook, left the offense punchless and made the 14–3 deficit insurmountable. In three quarters of action, McNabb was 10-for-22 for only 100 yards, while Buckhalter and Staley combined for 127 rushing yards. The Panthers rushed for 155 yards on the night. After what looked at times to be a blessed season, the Eagles' playoff campaign ended with an NFC Championship Game defeat, yet again.

Deltatheroida

Deltatheroida is an extinct group of basal metatherians that lived in the Cretaceous and were closely related to marsupials. Their fossils are restricted to Central Asia and North America. This order can be defined as all metatherians closer to "Deltatheridium" than to Marsupialia.
These mammals possessed tritubercular lower molars and these were not tribosphenic and were quite primitive. This is awkward because tribosphenic molars are commonly found in most therian mammals (there exist some exceptions such as anteaters and some whales, which have no teeth at all).
When they were first identified in the 1920s, they were believed to be placentals and possible ancestors of the creodonts (extinct carnivorous mammals), but this was later disproven.

Leyla Harding

Leyla Harding is a fictional character from the ITV soap opera "Emmerdale", played by Rokhsaneh Ghawam-Shahidi. She made her first on-screen appearance on 11 August 2008 and was introduced by series producer, Anita Turner. The character departed on 5 August 2011. Shahidi returned to "Emmerdale" for two episodes on 25 December 2013. She returned full time in January 2014. 
Casting.
In July 2008, the "Prestwich Advertiser" reported that actress Rokhsaneh Ghawam-Shahidi had joined the cast of "Emmerdale" as Leyla Harding. Ghawam-Shahidi signed an initial six-month contract. She said of her casting: "I’ve been filming for two weeks now and it’s great. [...] I’ve done a lot of theatre but not much TV work up to now so it’s great for me to work on such a popular and well established show. It’s a dream come true in fact." Ghawam-Shahidi later said that she was "so excited", commenting: "This is a brilliant opportunity for me as I've done lots of theatre but not much TV. Everyone at "Emmerdale" has been so warm and welcoming. It's such a well-established show and I can't wait to see what Leyla gets up to." "Emmerdale" series producer Anita Turner added, "Rokhsaneh is a terrific actress and an exciting new addition to the cast. Leyla's going to have some fun stirring up the factory."
Character development.
Characterisation.
Leyla is described as "streetwise" and "savvy". Ghawam-Shahidi described her as "very down to earth", "very lovable" and "really ballsy". Leyla was initially a new worker at Eric Pollard's (Chris Chittell) factory and it was said that she would immediately get on the right side of him. Leyla is reluctant to talk about her past, which sparks speculation about why she has moved to the village. "The Sun" described her as a "streetwise minx". Channel Five's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap describe Leyla as a "naive, honest, hard worker who can sometimes be a bit too trusting of people". "What's on TV" deemed her an "attractive woman". Ghawam-Shahidi told the "Daily Mirror" that she and Leyla are "quite similar in some ways" saying "We're both pretty ditsy and we have the same sense of fun. Leyla says things without thinking, and I can do that too." She added that their lives and relationships are very different because she and Leyla are "worlds apart".
Relationship with David Metcalfe.
Leyla begins a relationship with Eric's son, David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden). In October 2009, Leyla sleeps with her new boss, Nathan Wylde (Lyndon Ogbourne). However, when she admits that she regrets cheating on David, Nathan warns that he will not let her forget what happened and begins a "campaign of manipulation". Of the plot, Ogbourne told the Press Association: "The switch between being such a seemingly nice guy and the malicious way he's controlling Leyla is quite horrific." He added that Nathan would get "worse and worse" and could "easily fit into the cast of "American Psycho" by the end of it". Leyla then fears that Nathan will tell David the truth. Ghawam-Shahidi said this causes Leyla to be "under a lot of stress". However, Leyla confesses to David. Leyla and David later reconcile. Wolfenden said he believes that Leyla is the "right woman" for David, despite "all of the things she has done to him". He said "David seems to be under the thumb, and Leyla gets away with cheating, stealing and having a secret son. But David has been good enough to put that to one side, so because of that I reckon she must be the right girl for him."
Family.
In May 2010, Digital Spy reported that Leyla's sister, Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson), would be introduced. The website said Alicia arrives in the village and makes it clear that she has unfinished business with Leyla. Leyla and Alicia's relationship is "far from perfect". Leyla is forced to deal with Alicia's arrival in an attempt to keep her "murky and scandal-ridden" past buried. Anderson said that Alicia was set to make life quite complicated for Leyla. "Emmerdale" series producer Gavin Blyth added that Alicia will start stirring things up in Leyla's life the minute she sets foot in the village. Alicia arrives in the village to warn Leyla that she does not want her at their mother's funeral. However, Leyla ignores Alicia and they "have a bit of a screaming match" at the funeral, which leaves Alicia annoyed. Discussing what caused the "bad blood" between Alicia and Leyla in an interview with Digital Spy, Anderson said, "All I can really say is that something has definitely gone on between them! [...] The biggest clue I can give is that Alicia is fiercely protective of her family unit and she doesn't want anything to come between that. So you can read into that what you want!" Anderson said that Alicia does not want to cause trouble, but does not want Leyla around. Anderson added that Alicia would "prefer it if just disappeared". Alicia was introduced along with her husband, Justin (Andrew Langtree), and their son, Jacob (Joe Warren-Plant).
In September 2010, it was revealed that Leyla was the biological mother of Jacob. Ghawam-Shahidi said that she was "really shocked" when she learned about the storyline, but was also excited as she thought it would be "really interesting" to play. She opined that the storyline would bring a new dimension to Leyla. Ghawam-Shahidi was involved in Warren-Plant's casting as Jacob. Ghawam-Shahidi admitted that she was surprised that Leyla had not seen Jacob for so long, but understood as Leyla wanted to get on with her life and escape her past. Ghawam-Shahidi said that Leyla just wants to be Jacob's aunt. Leyla wants to see Jacob and interact with him like a normal aunt and nephew. Ghawam-Shahidi had previously said that Leyla kept the secret as she wanted to get on with her life. Ghawam-Shahidi also said that the easiest way for Leyla to move on in her life was to ignore it.
Leyla takes Jacob to a birthday party, where he goes into anaphylactic shock due to an allergic reaction to some cake. Speaking about the plot, Ghawam-Shahidi commented: "It's Leyla's fault because she hasn't listened to her sister's warnings about not letting Jacob eat anything because of his nut allergy." Ghawam-Shahidi added that if Leyla had listened to Alicia, it could have been avoided. The situation shocks Leyla and makes her realise that Alicia is Jacob's mother and needs to be listened to. Ghawam-Shahidi said that Leyla needs to learn to be "less full-on" and stop "indulging and spoiling" Jacob.
Departure.
In June 2011, the "Daily Star Sunday" reported that Ghawam-Shahidi was to leave "Emmerdale". Speaking to the newspaper, Ghawam-Shahidi confirmed: "I have had an amazing three years at "Emmerdale" and it has been a really tough decision to leave." She filmed her final scenes as Leyla later that month. Ghawam-Shahidi admitted to "We Love Telly" that it took her six months to reach the decision to leave the show. The actress explained that Anderson helped her reach the decision as she has experience of leaving a long-running serial. Ghawam-Shahidi said that viewers would see a "desperate" side to Leyla in the build-up to her departure.
Return.
Leyla returned to "Emmerdale" during the episode broadcast on 25 December 2013. Shahidi revealed that when she received the call from producer Kate Oates about coming back, it came at the "perfect time." Shahidi was initially in talks about coming back earlier, but the play she was appearing extended its run. She continued, "I went away from that not knowing whether Leyla was coming back, but then when Kate got in touch with this Christmas Day storyline, it just felt like fate because it was a much better way for Leyla to come back into the show." Shahidi said that she had always hoped Leyla would return at some point and she was excited about Leyla's return storyline. The show's producers decided not to announce Shahidi's return, so viewers would be surprised. When asked how long she would be staying with the show, Shahidi quipped that Leyla would have "lots of exciting stuff" in 2014 and she and Anderson had spent time filming on location. The actress added "After that, there's stuff in the pipeline but I haven't read the scripts yet!"
Alicia later finds Leyla working as a pole dancer. To prepare for the storyline, Shahidi took pole dancing lessons and had to wear a PVC catsuit. Shahidi explained that it was important for viewers to warm to Leyla and she did not want to be wearing "a little pair of panties", as it may have been off putting to some. She thought the catsuit was the perfect outfit for Leyla as it made her look ridiculous. Shahidi told Susan Hill from the "Daily Star" that she enjoyed the fact Leyla did not come back to the village straight away following her appearance at Christmas, saying "It means the viewers can see what she's been doing while she's been away." Hill reported that there would be "lots of twists and turns" as Leyla continues to work on her relationships with her sister and son. Shahidi added that she was looking forward to the next chapter in Leyla's life.
Storylines.
Leyla arrives in Emmerdale for a job interview with factory owner Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell). She tells him that she won Machinist of the Year in 2007 and left her last job because of "inappropriate overtime" with a young manager. Eric gives her the job and Leyla soon makes friends with her colleagues and joins the St. Mary's Church Choir, which forms to enter a competition and save the church from closure. 
Months after starting at the factory, her colleague Lily Butterfield (Anne Charleston) sees Leyla leaving the building late at night and arriving very early. Eventually, Leyla reveals she is sleeping there and that she was at university. Unfortunately her part-time jobs as a cleaner and barmaid meant things got on top of her and she left without finishing her course. Lily asked Leyla to move in with her and Edna Birch (Shirley Stelfox), Lily's sister, who was unhappy with the arrangement so Lily and Leyla joined Pearl Ladderbanks (Meg Johnson), who also works at the factory. When Pearl or Lily ask Leyla about her parents, she avoids answering their questions.
Leyla takes an interest in David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden), inviting him to a concert but he was sidetracked by his ex-girlfriend, Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler), was upset, thinking her father was terminally ill. On learning Rodney was healthy, David tells Leyla he can go to the concert after all. In early February, she goes out for the night with him and meets Skin, who drives them back to Emmerdale. While Skin tries getting close to Leyla, she makes him sleep in his van overnight. The following day, Pearl sees him fleeing after stealing their valuables. David, by chance, knocks him over and Leyla kisses him to thank him. They have a brief relationship but he dumps her upon assuming she believes he still has feelings for Nicola. In April, they restart their relationship. Leyla tells David that her mother is in a care home, and she is trying to earn as much money as possible to fund it. They grow closer during May when they campaign for election to the local council and he wins on 4 June.
Leyla starts work as deputy manager of the new farm shop opened by Natasha Wylde (Amanda Donohoe) in the village. On seeing Maisie's new shoes, Leyla was jealous and stole £250 from the shop for a pair, planning to put it back when she got paid. However, Natasha's son Nathan (Lyndon Ogbourne) found out, and to Leyla's surprise, was much nicer than she expected. After accompanying each other to a concert, they become intoxicated before sleeping together. Attempting to quit her job, Nathan's behaviour turns nasty. He begins to blackmail her until David becomes suspicious. In November, she admits to her one-night stand with Nathan and, disgusted, he left. When he saw Nathan attacking Leyla, he punched him but told Leyla that he hadn't done it for her. David later forgave Leyla and they reunited in December. Leyla now owns the farm shop that she used to work in and has renamed it "Leyla's".
David and Leyla are officially together and moved in together, buying Farrers Barn. Leyla got the news that her mum had died and insisted on attending the funeral alone. She comforted Alicia (Natalie Anderson), her sister, during the service but Alicia insisted Leyla leave, telling her that she couldn't be trusted. Leyla later went to her sister's house and watched her with her husband, Justin, and young son, Jacob (Joe-Warren Plant). She met Justin several times on the quiet, leading David to think she was having an affair with him. She swore she wasn't but wouldn't explain so David left for a council trip, hurt and disappointed, thinking Leyla was lying to him. While away, Alicia turned up with Jacob, and during a heart to heart, Leyla's difficult relationship with her mother and sister was explained. Jacob is, in fact, Leyla's son. She got pregnant accidentally and had planned a termination but was "persuaded" not to as Alicia couldn't get pregnant so she and her husband adopted Leyla's son. It was later revealed that Alicia's husband was in fact the father of Jacob, after a drunken one night stand with Leyla. 
When Alicia and Jacob revealed that Alicia and Justin had split up and they were homeless, Leyla insisted they move in with her and David. David was not happy about this but accepted it to make Leyla happy. Alicia soon got a job as barmaid at The Woolpack but annoyed David by constantly assuming that Leyla would be happy to babysit. Eventually David got so fed up of the complications that having Jacob around caused, he demanded Leyla choose: him or Jacob. She promptly left the village, but later got in contact when she sent Jacob a present. After Alicia and David tell Jacob that Leyla is his birth mother, Jacob begins emailing Leyla.
Leyla returns to the village demanding to speak to Alicia and Jacob. She finds David at the B&B and tells him that Jacob has been emailing her, as he knows she is his biological mother. Leyla then learns that David is marrying Alicia. Val locks Leyla in a cupboard, preventing her from ruining the wedding. She is later let out and comes face-to-face with Alicia, who slaps Leyla.
Alicia sees that Jacob is confused and upset following Leyla's surprise visit and agrees to meet her, allowing Leyla to be part of Jacob's life. After Alicia drops Leyla off at her flat, Leyla sneaks out of the building and is followed by Alicia into a strip club where Leyla is revealed to be working at a pole dancer. An angry Alicia drags Leyla off the stage before they are caught up in a police raid and arrested on suspicion of soliciting. They are released the following day and a homeless Leyla returns to Emmerdale with Alicia, much to David's annoyance. Leyla forms a friendship with Priya Sharma (Fiona Wade) who helps her get a job at the factory. She then moves in with Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward).
Reception.
A reporter from Holy Soap named Leyla's most "memorable moment" as being when she thought Rodney was attempting to seduce her.

Parity problem (sieve theory)

In number theory, the parity problem refers to a limitation in sieve theory that prevents sieves from giving good estimates in many kinds of prime-counting problems. The problem was identified and named by Atle Selberg in 1949. Beginning around 1996, John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec developed some parity-sensitive sieves that make the parity problem less of an obstacle.
The problem.
Terence Tao gave this "rough" statement of the problem:
This problem is significant because it may explain why it is difficult for sieves to "detect primes," in other words to give a non-trivial lower bound for the number of primes with some property. For example, in a sense Chen's theorem is very close to a solution of the twin prime conjecture, since it says that there are infinitely many primes "p" such that prime "p" + 2 is either prime or the product of two primes. The parity problem suggests that, because the case of interest has an odd number of prime factors (namely 1), it won't be possible to separate out the two cases using sieves.
Example of the parity problem.
This example is due to Selberg and is given as an exercise with hints by Cojocaru & Murty.
The problem is to estimate separately the number of numbers ≤ "x" with no prime divisors ≤ "x"1/2, that have an even (or an odd) number of prime factors. It can be shown that, no matter what the choice of weights in a Brun- or Selberg-type sieve, the upper bound obtained will be at least (2 + "o"(1)) "x" / ln "x" for both problems. But in fact the set with an even number of factors is empty and so has size 0. The set with an odd number of factors is just the primes between "x"1/2 and x, so by the prime number theorem its size is (1 + "o"(1)) "x" / ln "x". Thus these sieve methods are unable to give a useful upper bound for the first set, and overestimate the upper bound on the second set by a factor of 2.
Parity-sensitive sieves.
Beginning around 1996 John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec developed some new sieve techniques to "break" the parity problem.
One of the triumphs of these new methods is the Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem, which states that there are infinitely many primes of the form "a"2 + "b"4.
Glyn Harman relates the parity problem to the distinction between "Type I" and "Type II" information in a sieve.

True North II

True North II was a small, 10.6 metre glass-bottom tour boat that sank on June 16, 2000, in of water off of Tobermory, Ontario, Canada, in Georgian Bay, while transporting a class of 13 students from an overnight field trip to Flowerpot Island back to the mainland. Two of the students, 12-year-olds Wade Simmons and Henrike Foerster, were killed in the sinking. The ship sank suddenly in rain and nearly gale-force winds, causing the parents of the deceased to question the captain's decision to travel in such bad weather. The captain ignored weather service warnings about the heavy seas and high winds prior to leaving the dock.
The remaining 18 people on board (11 of whom were classmates of the victims) managed to survive by swimming approximately 200 metres to shore. None of the passengers were wearing lifejackets, as it was not officially required by law at the time to don them unless the captain ordered a ship evacuation. This rule came under some scrutiny after the accident.
An inquest into the events was in fact later launched and ended in the jury calling for safer school field trips and boating standards in Ontario. One issue that was pointed out was that there were 22 lifejackets, which were stored in garbage bags, on board, but that only two were child-sized despite the fact that there were 13 children on board. The sinking of the "True North II" on a whole, however, was ruled to be an accident.

2007 Hitman case

The 2007 hitman case is an Australian criminal case involving Steven Wayne Spaliviero and Swede Charlotte Karin Lindström. Lindström is so far the only one sentenced for the crime. Spaliviero is currently in jail awaiting sentence since 2006 for drug-related crimes but has been found not guilty of the murder plot. The hitman case has been widely reported by media in Australia and Scandinavia.
Charlotte Lindström.
Charlotte Karin Lindström (born 9 August 1984 in Sollentuna, Sweden) is a former waitress, promotion model and former prisoner having spent 3 years in a Sydney jail after being arrested on 26 May 2007 at 10.40 am in Sydney, Australia on suspicion of trying to hire a hitman to kill two men who were about to testify against her boyfriend Steven Spaliviero in court.
Case.
Lindström arrived in Sydney in 2004 working as a part-time model as well as a waitress in the exclusive nightclub Hemmesphere in Sydney.
In Sydney, Lindström met Steven Spaliviero and they soon started a relationship living in an apartment in Darling Harbour. Lindström later told the court that she soon realised that he was both a wealthy businessman and a drug dealer. In early 2007, investigators started to look into Spaliviero's business and soon found two witnesses who said they had information about the man's drug dealing business. At that time Spaliviero was already on bail from Melbourne in relation to another drug case. Spaliviero was arrested, refused bail and sent to Metropolitan Remand and Reception Center ("MRRC") in Silverwater, New South Wales.
Murder plot.
In MRRC, Spaliviero allegedly met another inmate who offered him to get witnesses in Spaliviero's case killed. In relation to this, Spaliviero phoned Lindström from MRRC telling her to meet a "solicitor" and give him money.
Lindström started acting upon instructions from Spaliviero. When Lindström finally met who she thought was a hitman, but who in reality was an undercover police officer, she was arrested. The policeman on the case stated that Lindström wanted to have two men to the "cemetery" which meant she wanted them dead. The price was agreed as AUD 100,000 for each contract.
Upon her arrest on 26 May Lindström was remanded in custody. Later an application for bail was made where Steven Spalivieros mother, Dolores Spaliviero, offered to put up AUD 2,000,000 surety to get Lindström out from custody. In addition, Lindström's friend and employer, Justin Hemmes provided an undertaking that if Lindström was set free on bail, he would let her continue her work at the Hemmesphere nightclub until trial. The application for bail was denied due to flight risk and Lindström was remanded in custody.
On 18 September, having had a deal made with the prosecutors Lindström pled guilty to the charges. On 21 December, she pled guilty yet in another court in Sydney. Lindström appeared in a bullet-proof vest at her court hearings because of the alleged death threats against her.
Lindström was initially sentenced to four years in jail being eligible for early parole on 25 May 2009. Even though Lindström was given a hefty discount from her sentence because she had agreed to testify against Steven Spaliviero and two other men, the Crown appealed against the sentence as "manifestly inadequate". The criminal court of appeals heard the appeal on 4 July. 2008
On 23 July 2008, her maximum sentence was increased from three years and 10 months to four years and nine months, making her eligible for parole in May 2010.
On 11 August 2008, Lindström started testifying against Spaliviero in his court case, even reading a love letter to the court which she had written to him in February 2007, some months before her own arrest.
Despite Lindström's extensive testimonies, Spaliviero and two other defendants were found not guilty for the murder plot.
Lindström was released on parole from Long Bay Jail in New South Wales on 25 May 2010 and deported the next day from Australia.
Since her release from prison, Lindström has returned to her native home Sweden and is understood to have had ongoing threats against her life.
According to the Australian media, on 15 August 2010, Charlotte Lindström agreed to return to Australia to testify in the trial of Spaliviero's associate. Due to an unspecified severe illness, she has not been allowed to travel to Australia. The upcoming trial has been postponed.
Court hearings after sentence.
On 11 August 2008, Lindström was in court reading the love letter she wrote to Steven in February 2007, some months before her own arrest.
In June 2009, Lindström started to testify against Spaliviero in a Sydney courtroom. A video of Lindströms 2007 arrest in Sydney was also released to the media. However, in July 2009 Steven Spaliviero and two suspected accomplices were found not guilty of conspiracy to murder the witnesses. Spaliviero argued that Lindström had acted alone and that he, Spaliviero, only wanted to discredit the witnesses, not murder them.
Media.
In November, a few months after being released Charlotte Lindström appeared on the Australian 60 Minutes on Channel 9 telling about her time in jail and about how she could do the crime she was sentenced for.
Channel 9 in Australia will air a documentary on 6 September 2011 concentrating on Charlotte Lindström's murder plot. According to the article in the Sydney Morning Herald Charlotte Lindström "no longer has feelings for" Steven Spaliviero.

<doc id="18817753" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18817753" title="Banksia sessilis var. cygnorum">
Banksia sessilis var. cygnorum

"Banksia sessilis" var. "cygnorum" is a variety of "Banksia sessilis" (Parrot Bush).
Description.
It grows as a shrub up to five metres high, with a down of fine hairs on the stems. This variety has the smallest leaves of any "B. sessilis" variety, being no more than three centimetres long, and less than two centimetres wide. They are often wedge-shaped with a long, toothless lower margin, and as such are quite similar to those of "B. sessilis" var. "flabellifolia", only somewhat smaller, with a concave lower margin, sometimes with small lobes at the base, and often a much darker green. As with other varieties of "B. sessilis", the flowers are greenish-yellow. Each head contains from 55 to 65 flowers.
Taxonomy.
This variety was first published by Michel Gandoger in 1919. Gandoger actually published two names: "Dryandra quinquedentata", based on specimen material collected from the Swan River by Arthur Mills Lea in 1902; and "Dryandra cygnorum", based on material collected by Alexander Morrison from the Swan River in the vicinity of Melville, on 31 Jul7 1897. In 1996, Alex George declared these two names to refer to the same plant, since Gandoger distinguished them only by the width of the leaves, the number of leaf teeth, and the length of the flower head, all of which are quite variable in this variety. He adopted the epithet "cygnorum", demoting it to a variety of "D. sessilis". Gandoger did not explicitly give an etymology for the epithet "cygnorum", but it is assumed to be from the Latin "cygnorus" ("swan"), in reference to the Swan River, from whence it was first collected.
The current name of this variety arose in 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred "Dryandra" into "Banksia"; thus the variety's current full name is "Banksia sessilis" var. "cygnorum" (Gand.) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele.
Distribution and habitat.
"B. sessilis" var. "cygnorum" occurs along the coast of Western Australia from Dongara in the north, to south of Fremantle. It largely occurs near the coast, in sand over limestone; but it does occur further inland, at Kings Park and also around Lake Indoon.
Cultivation.
This variety is little known in cultivation. It is suggested that cultivation requirements would be similar to the better-known "B. sessilis" var. "sessilis". Despite being a coastal plant, it has been reported as being frost-resistant down to -7°C.

Osborne's professional playing career began in 1929, and while he never reached the Major Leagues as a pitcher, he enjoyed great success in the Pacific Coast League (1936–1938; 1943–1947) and the Western International League (1938–1942). He won 22 games for the 1936 Seattle Indians, and in 1942 led the WIL in victories (22), winning percentage (.815) and earned run average (1.63) as the playing manager of the league champion Vancouver Capilanos. It was Osborn's first year as a manager. He would lead teams in the farm systems of the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies through 1957 before joining the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1958 as a roving troubleshooter and consultant in their minor league system.
In , Osborn was named pitching coach of the Pirates, and he would serve three terms in that post — 1963–1964; 1970–1972; and 1974–1976. During most of that time, he worked under manager Danny Murtaugh, and he was a member of the 1971 World Series champion Pirates club. At age 70, Osborn was appointed pitching coach of the Bucs for a fourth time after the season — this time by skipper Chuck Tanner — but ill health forced his resignation a few weeks after his appointment. He died in Torrance, California, during spring training in March 1979. As a minor league pitcher, Osborn won 199 games, losing 119 for a stellar .626 winning percentage. His record as a minor-league manager was 929–751 (.553) with four championships.

Ann Gotlib

Ann Gotlib (born May 5, 1971) was an immigrant girl who disappeared from the premises of a Louisville, Kentucky mall on June 1, 1983. The case to find her abductor and killer was covered heavily by the Louisville news media and stretched for the next twenty-five years until the suspect, deceased, was finally identified.
Background.
Gotlib, a Russian Jewish immigrant, came to the United States in 1980 and was fluent in English and Russian.
Disappearance.
Ann was last seen on June 1, 1983 between 5:30 and 6:00 PM. She was visiting Bashford Manor Mall, across the street from the apartment complex where she lived with her family. Her bike was later found outside the Bacon's Department Store at the mall.
Investigation.
Gotlib vanished without any trace ever being found. The FBI headed the investigation. Police investigated thousands of leads and between thirty and forty suspects over the years. Three days after her disappearance, a police dog traced a scent to the apartment of Ester Okmyansky, the grandmother of the last person to see Gotlib alive. Okmyansky said Gotlib had never visited the apartment, and after a thorough investigation of her family, police concluded the dog had been in error.
Others investigated included a sex offender who had been at the mall within an hour of Gotlib's disappearance and a serial sex offender who had an alibi.
An often repeated conspiracy theory held that Gotlib had been abducted by the Russian government to force her parents to return to their country of origin. Both FBI and the Gotlib family had dismissed this theory. Another theory was that she had left voluntarily after having trouble adapting to life in the United States. Investigators and her family dismissed this as well, saying she gave no indications of anxiety prior to the disappearance, and if she had run away voluntarily she likely would have taken some money or possessions, and made contact eventually.
In 1990, Texas Death Row inmate Michael Lee Lockhart claimed to have killed Gotlib and buried her body at Fort Knox and eventually provided a map of the burial site, but after a thorough investigation police found no physical evidence to verify the claim.
Up through 2008 the Louisville Metro Police Department still listed the disappearance as an open case. Nevertheless, it was considered a cold case due to the amount of time that had passed. The investigation documents fill four filing cabinets.
2008 developments.
On December 4, 2008 Louisville Metro Police announced a major break in the disappearance case of Ann Gotlib. A spokesperson for the LMPD, commenting on new developments in the case, suggested that it was the police's belief that convicted felon and former veterinarian Gregory Oakley Jr. — who had been a suspect since the initial disappearance in 1983 — had possibly been responsible for the young girl's disappearance. Oakley died in Alabama in 2002 after being released from the Kentucky State Reformatory in La Grange on a medical pardon, where he was serving time for burglary and rape. That case was similar to the Gotlib case by the fact the victim was a 13-year-old girl having red hair. Police believe that Oakley followed Gotlib to the Bashford Manor Mall parking lot, where he abducted her leaving nothing but her bike.
According to a man who had once served time in a Kentucky prison in the late 1980s and early 1990s with Oakley, Oakley confessed to abducting Gotlib and killing her with an overdose of Talwin, a pain killer. Police had considered Oakley a suspect in the Gotlib case since January 1984, when Oakley was arrested and eventually convicted of raping a 13-year-old Louisville girl. Oakley failed a polygraph test concerning Gotlib, but police never had enough evidence to tie him to her disappearance.
Impact.
Due to the startling way Gotlib vanished in broad daylight without any trace, it was a key case that lead the United States Congress to create the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 1984 to coordinate departments involved in missing persons cases. The center credits the Gotlib case with increasing national awareness of missing and abducted children and revolutionizing how missing-child cases are handled. One new technique that came out of the investigation was the use of billboards and other tactics to generate widespread awareness of a missing person, which was considered foolish by conventional wisdom at the time.

Phi Rho Eta

Phi Rho Eta (ΦPH) is a nationally incorporated, fraternity that was founded on August 22, 1994 at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois. The founders are LaMont Taylor and Marvin Randolph. 
Phi Rho Eta is based on the three principles of pride, respect, and excellence through community development, academics, and social interactions.
History.
The founders, Marvin Randolph and Lamont Taylor, were raised in neighborhoods that overflowed with the social diseases of drugs, violence, poverty, and hopelessness. Randolph and Taylor met as brothers of the Zeta Nu chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, and while there determined the ideas and implementation for Phi Rho Eta. The founders had an idea to establish an organization on the premise that it would promote the principles of pride, respect, and excellence. They sought to form a brotherhood that would work to set the standard of manhood, an organization comprising charismatic men striving to model and teach exemplary positive behavior.
Since its founding date, Phi Rho Eta has striven to benefit the community. Phi Rho Eta is concentrated in the Midwest but has plans to expand. Phi Rho Eta has not become a member of any national fraternity council such as the National Pan-Hellenic Council or North-American Interfraternity Conference.
National programs.
The national philanthropy of the fraternity is the Mentor Teacher Brother program (MTB). Mentor Teacher Brother is the polestar community development program of Phi Rho Eta. As the name illustrates, MTB revolves around the core concepts of mentorship, learning, and brotherhood. The program is designed to cultivate positive principles and attributes through one on one interaction, group learning, and unity.
Chapters.
Phi Rho Eta has both undergraduate and graduate chapters
Membership.
New members of the fraternity are accepted on both undergraduate and graduate levels.
Membership intake.
The intake period is what a potential member of the fraternity engages in before being initiated as a member. This period is the time the potential member learns of the organization's history, principles and tenacity of brotherhood.

2003 Tennessee Titans season

The 2003 Tennessee Titans season was the team's 44th season and their 34th in the National Football League. At 12–4 the Titans posted the 15th season with at least ten wins in the franchise's history dating to their Houston Oilers days. Quarterback Steve McNair threw for 3,215 yards and 24 touchdowns to just seven interceptions; he also rushed for 138 yards and four touchdowns, all despite missing two games to injury, and was named the NFL's co-MVP with Peyton Manning of the Titans' division arch-rival Indianapolis Colts. Eddie George rushed for 1,031 yards and five touchdowns while Derrick Mason had 1,303 receiving yards and eight touchdowns. Justin McCareins had 586 punt/kick return yards and a return touchdown.
Game summaries.
In a rematch of the 2002 AFC Title Game the Titans got a measure of revenge in a game that featured 28 combined penalties (17 by the notoriously penalty-prone Raiders). The Titans took an early 9–3 lead on a Tyrone Calico touchdown catch (with a missed PAT) and 50-yard field goal from ex-Raider Joe Nedney while the kicker who replaced Nedney in Oakland, Sebastian Janikowski, drilled a 47-yarder in the first quarter. Nedney himself was injured during the game, so Craig Hentrich came off the bench and booted three additional field goals for the Titans. The Raiders kept the game close as Steve McNair managed two touchdown throws and Rich Gannon added two for the Raiders, but Hentrich's 33-yard boot in the final minute sealed a 25–20 Titans win.
Peyton Manning defeated the Titans for the first time in three career starts in a 33–7 rout. Mike Vanderjagt kicked four field goals and Nick Harper snatched a Steve McNair INT and ran it back 75 yards for a fourth-quarter touchdown. The loss put the Titans in an early hole in the AFC South division race.
McNair missed only one throw in sixteen attempts, compiling 161 passing yards and three touchdowns. Rocky Boiman added his own touchdown in the fourth quarter by returning a Tommy Maddox interception 60 yards. The Titans triumphed 30–13.
One of the most ferocious games of the season for both clubs, the game lead changed on almost every possession. Two Titans field goals (by Craig Hentrich and Gary Anderson) in the first were followed by a 58-yard Tom Brady touchdown to Troy Brown. Adam Vinatieri missed two field goal tries while Anderson also missed, leaving the halftime score 13–7 Tennessee, but from the start of the second half the two teams erupted as the Patriots behind 153 rushing yards by Antowain Smith and reserve back Mike Cloud scored on all five second-half possessions. McNair rushed in two touchdowns to go with a total of four Anderson field goals, but following McNair's second rushing score and two-point pass to Tyrone Calico a 71-yard Bethel Johnson kick return led to a Mike Cloud touchdown. With the Patriots leading 31–27 McNair was picked off by a hobbled Ty Law for a 65-yard Patriots touchdown. The final Anderson field goal was followed by an onside kick recovered by the Patriots for a 38–30 Titans loss. 
In the first of the two teams' semi-annual "Houston Oilers Bowls" matchups the Titans honored former Oilers defensive end Elvin Bethea during halftime. McNair threw for a career-high 421 yards and three touchdowns in a 38–17 rout of the Texans. David Carr of Houston threw two touchdowns but was picked off three times and Andre Dyson returned one pick for a 51-yard Titans score. 
A week after the Panthers ended the unbeaten streak of the Indianapolis Colts, the Titans ended Carolina's own win streak in a 37–17 runaway. After rushing in a seven-yard touchdown in the first quarter, Steve McNair gave way to backup Billy Volek on a fake punt; Volek took the snap and threw a 50-yard score to Eddie Berlin. McNair returned to the game and added a touchdown throw to Drew Bennett and Keith Bulluck ran in a 23-yard fumble for a touchdown. Jake Delhomme of the Panthers managed two touchdown throws in his first loss as Panthers starter.
The Titans forced three interceptions from Dolphins quarterback Brian Griese and also recovered two Dolphins fumbles en route to a 31–7 win. McNair had two touchdown throws and 223 yards passing while the lone Dolphins score came from future Texans quarterback Sage Rosenfels on a fourth-quarter score to Donald Lee. 
After seven straight games where they scored at least 27 points (six straight with at least 30), the Titans were held to just ten points in a 10–3 win over the Jaguars and their first game against Jack Del Rio as Jacksonville coach. Gary Anderson booted a 33-yard field goal and Justin McCareins caught a five-yard score from McNair. Jacksonville was limited to a Seth Marler field goal in the fourth as Byron Leftwich was sacked six times and threw two picks.
The Titans surrendered 21 first-quarter points on an Allen Rossum punt return, a T.J. Duckett rushing score, and a Doug Johnson throw caught by Warrick Dunn at the Falcons 20 and run in for an 86-yard touchdown. But in the second the Falcons dropped a punt at their five-yard line and the Titans recovered; McNair then rifled a touchdown to Frank Wycheck, but had to leave the game with a strained calf. Billy Volek threw for 117 yards and one touchdown while Eddie George rushed for 115 yards and a score, ultimately securing a 38–31 Titans win, the club's largest comeback win since the 1978 Oilers season.
With an epic 38–34 loss to the Patriots the day before, the Indianapolis Colts gave the Titans an opening to take the division lead, but on "Monday Night Football" against the 4–7 Jets the Titans came out flat at The Meadowlands. Future Jet Justin McCareins caught a 59-yard touchdown from Steve McNair in the first quarter, but from there the Jets behind Chad Pennington erupted, scoring 24 points over the next three quarters. The Titans were stopped on downs when McNair tried to rifle a pass on 4th and 3 at the Jets goalline, and later clawed to 24–17 in the final 1:52 but the Jets recovered the ensuing onside kick. McNair competed despite the strained calf from the previous week and was 21 of 35 for 272 yards, two touchdowns, and two picks. 
Following losses to AFC East teams the week before the 9–3 Colts and 9–3 Titans squared off for the division lead. Five Mike Vanderjagt field goals helped the Colts build a 29–13 fourth-quarter lead, but the Titans stormed back with McNair touchdowns to Robert Holcombe and Derrick Mason; Mason's score came with 2:52 to go in regulation, but a two-point conversion was stopped when the Colts swatted down a McNair throw. The Colts killed the clock afterward for a 29–27 Titans loss that ended any hope of the division title.
A failed two-point conversion wound up deciding the outcome of a Titans game for the second straight week. Lingering injuries to McNair put Billy Volek into the starting role for this game. The Buffalo Bills erupted to a 17–6 third quarter lead, but Volek threw two touchdowns and ran in a third as the Titans took a 28–20 lead late in the fourth. Drew Bledsoe led the Bills down the field and threw a six-yard touchdown strike to Mark Campbell with 24 seconds to go in regulation, but the two-point try was dropped in the endzone, and the ensuing onside kick was recovered by the Titans, ending a 28–26 Tennessee win.
McNair's final start of the regular season turned into a hard-fought back-and-forth affair as the Texans strove for their first win over the team that left Houston after 1996. In the third quarter Marlon McCree ran back a McNair pick 95 yards for a touchdown (10–10 score), then the Texans fumbled the ball and Samari Rolle ran in a 61-yard Titans score (17–10 Titans). A Domanick Williams touchdown run with 2:48 to go in the fourth put Houston up 24–20, but McNair led the Titans down the field and threw the game-winning 23-yard score to Drew Bennett with 17 seconds remaining and a 27–24 Titans final.
Tampa's nightmarish season as defending Super Bowl champions finally ended in a 33–13 humiliation. Titans backup Neil O'Donnell was the starter and threw for 232 yards and two touchdowns. Brad Johnson of the Bucs threw three interceptions and backup Shaun King added a fourth and in the fourth also fumbled the ball in his endzone for a Titans score. Eddie George broke 10,000 career rushing yards in this game. 
Playoffs game summaries.
Turnovers were an order of the night as Steve McNair was picked off three times – Will Demps of the Ravens caught an Ed Reed deflection and ran back a first-quarter INT for a 56-yard tying touchdown – and Ravens quarterback Anthony Wright threw two picks. Eddie George suffered a dislocated shoulder on a tackle of Reed, but returned to the game. The Titans limited Jamal Lewis to 35 rushing yards (the entire Ravens squad managed just 54) and built a 17–10 fourth quarter lead before Wright tied the game with a 35-yard score to Todd Heap with 4:30 left in regulation. McNair led the Titans down the field and ran down enough clock that the game-winning Gary Anderson field goal (46 yards) came with 29 seconds left. The Titans advanced to the Divisional round with the 20–17 win, their first over their former AFC Central rival in six tries.
On a brutally cold night with temperatures barely above zero and wind chills well below zero, the Titans and Patriots faced off in a grinder. A 41-yard Tom Brady touchdown to Bethel Johnson was answered with a Titans drive ending in a 5-yard Chris Brown rushing score. Both Gary Anderson and Adam Vinatieri missed field goal tries in the bitter cold, but Vinatieri broke a 14-all tie with 4:06 to go with a 46-yard field goal. Having used all their timeouts, the Titans were forced to go for a long throw on 4th and 12 at the Patriots 42 in the game's final two minutes; as a Patriots blitz stormed through McNair unloaded a desperation heave; Drew Bennett, who had just made two incredible sideline catches, was surrounded by Patriots as he jumped for the ball, but it bounced off his fingers for a game-deciding incompletion, a 17–14 Patriots win and a bitter ending to the Titans season.

Algernon Methuen

Sir Algernon Methuen Marshall Methuen, 1st Baronet (23 February 1856 – 20 September 1924), born Algernon Stedman, was an English publisher and teacher of Classics and French. He is best known for founding the publisher Methuen & Co. (later Methuen Publishing Ltd.).
Background and education.
Methuen was born in London, the third son of J. B. Stedman FRCS. He was educated at Berkhamsted School and then Wadham College, Oxford, from which he graduated with a M.A.
Career.
After graduating from Oxford Methuen entered teaching and rose to be head of High Croft Preparatory School at Milford, Surrey from 1890 to 1895. While teaching he began as a sideline, writing a number of school text books under the non-de-plume A.W.S Methuen of which his series of French, Greek and Latin readers were best known. Among his works were books on gardening and current affairs. In June 1889, as a sideline to teaching, Methuen began to publish and market his own textbooks under the label Methuen & Co. (later Methuen Publishing Ltd.). Two months later he formally adopted Methuen as his surname. His first success at publishing came in 1892 with the publication of Rudyard Kipling's "Barrack-Room Ballads". He later published works by Hilaire Belloc, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Oscar Wilde. 
Methuen was an outspoken critic of the Boer War. He stood for Parliament as the Liberal party candidate for the seat of Guildford in the General Election of January 1910. The seat was a safe Conservative seat and he was unsuccessful. In 1916, he was created a baronet, of Gaywood, King's Lynn, in the County of Norfolk, and later published his own memoir.
Personal life.
Methuen married a daughter of Edwin Bedford in 1884. He died in September 1924, aged 68, when the baronetcy became extinct.

Harold Max Rosenberg

Harold Max Rosenberg (26 August 1922 – 21 November 1993), was a distinguished experimental physicist who is notable for two successful textbooks: "Low Temperature Solid State Physics" (1963) and "The Solid State" (1975) and over one hundred papers mainly about the electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of solids, especially at low temperatures.
Early Life & Education.
Harry Rosenberg was the son of a small shopkeeper in East Ham, UK. He left school at 16 and went into the Civil Service in a clerical post. He volunteered and served throughout the war in the RAF working with radio equipment, which he had studied in his spare time. On demobilization he was given a further education, a training grant, and studied at University College London (UCL). He graduated with a first class honours degree in physics from UCL, and then obtained a DPhil in 1953 from the University of Oxford under Kurt Mendelssohn.
Career.
Six years later he became a university lecturer and in 1978 was appointed a Reader. He also became a fellow of the newly
founded Linacre College, Oxford a graduate college, and subsequently, in 1970, a tutorial fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.
Harry Rosenberg's initial research was in the area of metals, but in 1962 new phenomena associated with magnetism and the interaction between magnetism and phonons (the quantized vibrations that store and transport heat in insulating as well as metallic solids) began to interest him. This occupied his attention for the next decade. Then, in 1972, he began the work on composite, disordered and amorphous materials that lasted until his retirement.
On his 60th birthday, in 1982, Rosenberg was gloomily contemplating the need to find a new topic of research to last until his retirement, when a note from an old colleague, Ray Orbach in California, showed that his experimental results on the low temperature properties of amorphous solids found a natural explanation in terms of the newly discovered mathematical theory of fractals, by now of course familiar through the strange and beautiful pictures that they generate.
This new approach to the interpretation of excitations in disordered solids was first expressed in the paper "Fractal interpretation of vibrational properties of cross-linked polymers, glasses and irradiated quartz," which, according to Orbach, was a very controversial piece of work, greeted with considerable skepticism. 
Rosenberg was regarded as a gifted lecturer, not only to undergraduates and to colleagues at conferences, 
but also to a much wider audience, both on the radio and on television.
Death.
He died on 21 November 1993, whilst on holiday in Brazil, survived by his wife Mildred Anna and three daughters.
Honors.
He was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and received the Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit.

1993 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships

The 1993 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships ("1993 WJHC") was the 17th edition of the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and was held in Gävle, Sweden. Canada won the gold medal, its sixth championship, while Sweden won silver, and the combined team of the Czech and Slovak Republics won bronze. Peter Forsberg of Sweden scored a tournament record 31 points, while teammate Markus Naslund's 13 goals also set a tournament record.
Final standings.
The 1993 tournament was a round-robin format, with the top three teams winning gold, silver and bronze medals respectively. As the tournament was ongoing, the nation of Czechoslovakia was dissolved into two separate nations, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, on New Years Day, 1993. The team remained unified throughout the tournament, however the Czechoslovakian flag and anthem were replaced with the flag and anthem of the International Ice Hockey Federation after January 1. Meanwhile, the former Soviet Union, which had competed in 1992 as the Commonwealth of Independent States was replaced in this tournament by Russia.

NSW State Heritage Register

The NSW State Heritage Register is a heritage register administered by the Government of New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage. 
The register was created in 1999 and contains over 20,000 statutory-listed items in either public or private ownership of historical, cultural, and architectural value for the whole of New South Wales. This includes items protected by heritage schedules to local environmental plans, regional environmental plans or by the State Heritage Register. The items include buildings, objects, monuments, Aboriginal places, gardens, bridges, landscapes, archaeological sites, shipwrecks, relics, bridges, streets, industrial structures and conservation precincts. 
The Heritage Council of New South Wales, a statutory body appointed by the NSW Government and comprising members of the community, the government, the conservation profession and representatives of organisations such as the National Trust of Australia, makes decisions about the care and protection of heritage places and items that have been identified as being significant to the people of NSW. The Council provides advice on heritage matters to the Minister responsible for heritage in NSW, presently Robyn Parker MP, entitled the Minister for Heritage. The Council recommends to the Minister places and objects for listing on the State Heritage Register. 
The work of the Council and the State Heritage Register is generally covered by the and its 2010 amendments. Under section 170 of the Act, government agencies in New South Wales are required to compile a register of heritage assets and look after their assets on behalf of the community. Other legislation preserves Aboriginal heritage.

A Thief in the Night (short story collection)

A Thief in the Night is a 1905 collection of short stories by Ernest William Hornung, featuring his popular character A. J. Raffles. It was the third book in the series, and the final collection of short stories. In it, Raffles, a gentleman thief, commits a number of burglaries in late Victorian England.
Although Raffles had been killed in the Second Boer War at the end of "The Black Mask", chronicler and accomplice Bunny Manders narrates additional adventures which he had previously omitted, from various points in their criminal careers. A full-length Raffles novel, "Mr. Justice Raffles", would follow in 1909. It too was set before the Boer War, with Raffles in his heyday as a gentlemen thief.

Schuylkill Canal Association

The Schuylkill Canal Association (SCA) is a non-governmental organization that maintains the Oakes Reach and Lock #60 of the Schuylkill Canal as a public recreation area and historical site. Organized in 1982 as the Schuylkill Canal Advisory Board, the Association, in cooperation with Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, maintains the canal reach, associated structures, parks and trails. The area extends along the canal and left bank of the Schuylkill River, from Mont Clare past Port Providence. The area makes up a large part of the Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section Historic District (#88000462).
As its first priority project, SCA repaired the Lock 60 lock tender's house at Lock 60 that had been abandoned in the 1950s. The lock tender's house was eventually restored to habitable condition. The restoration of Lock 60 itself to operating condition was another major SCA project that was completed in 2005. The house and lock are both contributing structures to the historic district.
SCA maintains the area near Lock 60 as a public park and periodically opens the lock tender's house and operates the lock for small recreational craft. The Canal Park has a river launch area and a floating dock in the canal. An association maintained portage trail at the other end of the canal reach, which with the park, creates a canoe and kayak loop. SCA also maintains the towpath trail and other adjacent trails. Plans to route the Schuylkill River Trail along the canal towpath will likely shift towpath maintenance from SCA to the county.
Canal Day.
The SCA organizes the annual Canal Day each summer on the last Sunday in June. This summer fair features events centered around the canal, including: a canoe and kayak race, a run, opening of the lock, and the popular pugil stick joust on a telephone pole over the canal. The events take place at the Lock 60 Canal Park and adjacent St. Michael's recreation field in Mont Clare.
Internet presence.
The Association is one of the earliest organizations on the Internet, where its presence as canal.org dates back to at least 1989.

Banksia sessilis var. flabellifolia

"Banksia sessilis" var. "flabellifolia" is a variety of "Banksia sessilis" (Parrot Bush).
Description.
It grows as a shrub up to five metres high. Unlike other varieties of "B. sessilis", it has hairless stems. The leaves are fan shaped, with a long, toothless lower margin, and a toothed end. As such its leaves are quite similar to some of those of "B. sessilis" var. "cygnorum", but are larger, being up to four centimetres long and 3.5 centimetres wide. They also lack lobes at the base. As with other varieties of "B. sessilis", the flowers are greenish-yellow. Each head contains around 90 flowers.
Taxonomy.
This variety was first published by Alex George in 1996, based on a specimen he collected on 11 August 1993 on West Binnu Road, 4.4 kilometres east of Yeringa South Road, north-north-west of Northampton, Western Australia. The varietal epithet is from the Latin "flabellum" ("fan") and "folium" ("leaf"), and refers to the fan-shaped leaves characteristic of this variety. The name given at the time was "Dryandra sessilis" var. "flabellifolia", and this stood until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred "Dryandra" into "Banksia"; thus the variety's current full name is "Banksia sessilis" var. "flabellifolia" (A.S.George) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele.
In 1999, George placed it between "B. sessilis" var. "sessilis" and "B. sessilis" var. "cordata" in phyletic order.
Distribution and habitat.
"B. sessilis" var. "flabellifolia" grows in both deep sand and on laterite, between Geraldton and Kalbarri inland to Northampton and south as far as Moora, in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia
Cultivation.
This variety is little known in cultivation. It is suggested that cultivation requirements would be similar to the better-known "B. sessilis" var. "sessilis", but that this variety would be better suited to hotter, drier coastal areas.

Humphrey John Stewart (22 May 1856 – 1932) was an American composer and organist, born in England. A native of London, he came to the United States in 1886, and served for many years as a church organist on the West Coast. In 1898, he was awarded an a doctorate degree in music from the University of the Pacific. In 1901, he gave a recital in Buffalo, New York and accepted a position at Trinity Church in Boston, but after two years he returned to San Francisco. In 1915, Stewart took a position as organist at the Panama-California Exposition in San Diego, and stayed in that city for many years, playing open-air organ concerts at Balboa Park.
Stewart was a founding member of the American Guild of Organists, and was an honorary lifetime member of the Bohemian Club. In the pages of "The American Organist", Stewart wrote in March 1919 about what he called the "Messiah Fallacy", a critical analysis uncomplimentary to Handel's "Messiah". Stewart described how the music of the "Messiah" was completely incompatible to the sacred nature of the text, except for the "Hallelujah" chorus, of which he was non-committal, preferring Beethoven's "Hallelujah". A flurry of letters to the editor resulted, some critical of Stewart, some supportive of his stance.
Works.
Among his works were an opera, two comic operas, three Grove Plays, incidental music for plays, some works for orchestra, choral music, and some songs and instrumental works; he also wrote church music.

Ray Lev

Ray Lev (May 8, 1912 – May 20, 1968) was an American classical pianist. One year after her birth in Rostov na Donau, Russia, her father, a synagogue cantor, and mother, a concert singer, brought her to the United States.
Life.
Lev’s early piano studies were with Waiter Ruel Cowles in New Haven, Connecticut and Gaston Déthier in New York. She made her debut at age 17 in England performing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 under Sir Landon Ronald. After winning the American Matthay Prize and the Philharmonic Symphony Scholarship, she studied with Tobias Matthay in England from 1930 to 1933. Thereafter, Lev returned to the United States, where she made her New York debut in 1934 with the National Orchestral Association. Her annual recitals in Carnegie Hall were generally sold out; she also toured successfully in Europe, the United States, and Canada and performed on radio network broadcasts. In one such Carnegie Hall recital, on November 10, 1944, Lev gave the first complete traversal ever presented in that venue of the Six Pieces, op. 118 of Johannes Brahms. Lev also was a champion of modern works. For instance, in November 1945, again at Carnegie Hall, she gave the premiere of Louise Talma's "Alleluia in Form of a Toccata" and of 24-year-old Douglas Townsend's "Sonatina No. 1", which she repeated in a March 31, 1946 recital at New York Times Hall broadcast live over WNYC. A November 1948 Carnegie Hall recital included the Hora movement from the 1937 "Chassidic Suite" of Jakob Schönberg.
Lev gave two command performances in London, England, performed for US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and earned seven citations for patriotic service by extensively performing for US and allied armed forces during World War II. In 1948, however, she took a step that would negate any benefit from these public-spirited activities and that effectively would put an end to the progress of her career: she joined 31 other American musicians, artists, and writers in signing an open letter of solidarity with twelve Russian writers who had called for fellow Communists to declare themselves publicly. As a result, in 1950 she had the dubious distinction of being the sole classical pianist named in the "Red Channels" list of alleged communist sympathizers during the American Red Scare. Little information about her appears thereafter, and her name is largely forgotten today, although one reference suggests that she continued playing throughout her remaining life, including nearly annual Carnegie Hall recitals, and performed the Schumann Piano Concerto in April 1968, a month before her death. Some support for the former claim can be found in the Fall 1958 "Juilliard Review", which indicates that on April 8 of that year she performed the premiere of "Toccata for Piano" by Juilliard alumnus Wallingford Riegger at Carnegie Hall. Presumably, however, she became primarily a teacher; her students include Aki Takahashi and the currently active American pianist Miriam Brickman.
Recordings.
In a 78 RPM set released by Musicraft Records in early 1939, Lev and clarinettist David Weber collaborated in the first recording of the Brahms Sonata in F minor, op. 120 no. 1, in its original instrumentation for clarinet and piano. After World War II, Lev began making phonograph records for the Concert Hall Society label, issued first on 78 RPM disks and then on LPs. She set down some adventurous literature for the day, including Schubert’s Piano Sonata in C Major, D. 840 ("Reliquie") with the completion by Ernst Krenek, probably otherwise represented on records in this form only by the slightly later performance of Friedrich Wührer on Vox. Her recording has not appeared on compact disc, although Wührer's has received a private CD release copied from LP. Lev’s records that have achieved CD reissue include her 1946 account of Bach’s Concerto No. 5 in D minor after Vivaldi’s op. 3, no. 11, BWV 596, in her own transcription, and a waltz by Sergei Prokofiev, no. 2 from his "Music for Children", op. 65.

MidWestOne Financial Group is the fifth largest publicly traded bank holding company in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is the holding company of MidWestOne Bank, which has 28 banking locations in central and eastern Iowa.
History.
MidWestOne Financial Group was founded in the 1900s under the name Mahaska Investment Company in Oskaloosa, Iowa. The name was derived of the name of the Mahaska County, the county in which Oskaloosa was. In 2004, Mahaksa Investment Company announced that it would merge all of its subsidiaries into one bank called MidWestOne Bank & Trust. The Company would also change its name to MidWestOne Financial Group. The company would stay headquartered in Oskaloosa. In 2005, the company announced that it would change the name of its bank to MidWestOne Bank. The company would have the same name.
Merger.
On September 12, 2007, MidWestOne Financial Group and ISB Financial Corp. announced that they had gone into a definitive agreement to merge, creating the third largest publicly traded holding company headquartered in Iowa. The current company President and CEO of MidWestOne, Charles Howard, would become the Vice Chairman of the board of directors. The President and CEO of ISB Financial Corp., Charlie Funk, would become the President and CEO of MidWestOne Financial Group. The Merger was completed on March 14, 2008. On that date, MidWestOne ceased to exist and ISB Financial Corp. survived the merger and changed its name to MidWestOne. After the company merger, MidWestOne announced that it would merge its subsidiaries together. The subsidiaries of the "old" MidWestOne Financial Group were MidWestOne Bank. Before the merger, ISB Financial corp had two subsidiaries. They were: Iowa State Bank and Trust Company of Iowa City Iowa, and First State Bank of Conrad Iowa. On August 11, 2008, the banks merged and became one bank named MidWestOne Bank.
Effect of Parkersburg Tornado and Iowa Floods.
On May 25, 2008, the Parkersburg, Iowa Branch of First State Bank (now known as MidWestOne Bank) was destroyed by an EF-5 tornado. The tornado was caught on the ATM camera outside of the bank moments before it hit. During the Iowa Flood of 2008, the Coralville, Iowa and Waterloo, Iowa branches of the bank were inundated with water. The Coralville, Iowa branch has since reopened. The Waterloo, Iowa branch office will reopen in a new location at 3110 Kimball Avenue in Spring 2009. Information about the natural disasters can be found on the second page of the 2008 second-quarter earnings report for the company.

1949 Chatham Cup

The 1949 Chatham Cup was the 22nd annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Eden (Auckland), Moturoa (New Plymouth), Petone, Technical Old Boys (Christchurch), Northern (Dunedin), and Invercargill Thistle.
The 1949 final.
The final was played in front of a then-record crowd of 12,000. Interest was high as the local Wellingtonian team was a lower ranked team (in the second division of Wellington football) who had gained a reputation as giant-killers. They went on to win the final 1-0 after having beaten several higher ranked sides in the course of the tournament, including a narrow win over Waterside and a heavy 7-1 thrashing of Wellington Marist. The final is memorable for the magic of the giant-killing performance, which caught the imagination of the local population. The only goal of the match came in the second half, when Northern keeper Jim Stephenson parried a David McKissock shot directly into the path of Petone forward Wally Hewitt who duly scored. Petone survived a late scare when keeper Ben Savage was required to save a penalty, and the Settlers of Petone held on to win by the solitary goal.
Results.
Semi-finals.
Match abandoned after 40 minutes of extra time due to bad light.

Smith &amp; Wesson Model 645

The Smith & Wesson 645 and Smith & Wesson 745 are second-generation semi-automatic pistols which predates Smith & Wesson's 4500 series of handguns. The S&W 645/745 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The S&W 645 is constructed almost entirely from stainless steel and is thus extremely resistant to harsh weather conditions, whereas the S&W 745 has a stainless steel frame and a blued carbon steel slide. The S&W 645 was introduced in 1985 and discontinued in 1988. The S&W 745 was produced from 1986 to 1990, primarily as a single-action competition gun for IPSC shooting.
History.
Smith & Wesson (S&W) began experiments with .45 ACP-firing pistols in 1984, and produced their first one, the Model 645, in 1985. Public demand led to the development of this series. The series is a .45 ACP version of their 9mm Parabellum weapons. They are normally double-action weapons, or what Smith & Wesson refers to as a traditional double action. They generally have a barrel bushing press fitted into the muzzle end of the slide instead of a separate barrel bushing like a 1911 pistol. Like many Smith & Wesson models, each variant was generally in production for only a few years.
The Model 645 was introduced in 1985, and produced until 1988. It has a stainless steel frame and slide, an ambidextrous safety/decocker, a squared trigger guard, and black plastic grip plates. The Model 745, built from 1986-1990, was a single-action target version of the Model 645, with a match barrel, Novak sight (an adjustable rear sight was optional), an adjustable trigger stop, and walnut grip plates. It does not have ambidextrous controls, but does have a half-cock safety.
Smith & Wesson changed its numbering system with the introduction of its third generation iteration, where a four digit numeral replaced the earlier three digit numeral designators. One of the first in this series was the 4505; this is essentially the 645 with only the safety catch ambidextrous and a blued finish. A Novak Lo-Mount rear sight was installed on a small number of 4505s. It was produced only in 1991. The Smith & Wesson Model 4506, is made of satin finished stainless steel, a Novak Lo-Mount rear sight later in the series, and a Xenoy wrap-around grip with either a straight or arched backstrap. After 1998, the 4506 had a rounded trigger guard profile, which replaced the earlier squared profile inherited from the 645. The 4506 was produced from 1988-2001.
The S&W 645 was used in Miami Vice by the character Vice Detective Sonny Crockett in seasons 3 and 4 of the TV series.
Journalist Hunter S. Thompson took his own life with an S&W 645 on February 20, 2005 after battling numerous medical issues.

This tradition 神道流 was founded by Ushu Tatewaki during the 16th Century. Contrary to popular belief outside Japan, Ushu Tatewaki was not the founder of the Shingan Ryu a.k.a. Yagyu Shingan Ryu. When developing the Yagyu Shingan Ryu, the founder Takenaga Hayato was clearly influenced by the Shindō-ryū of Ushu Tatewaki (Shindo Tatewaki) of which he mastered. Takenaga was also influenced by Yagyu Munenori and studied the Yagyu Shinkage Ryu. Before Takenaga Hayato returned to his home in Sendai he was directed by Yagyu Munenori to include the name Yagyu in his tradition of Shingan Ryu. As a result of his influence Ushu Tatewaki and the Shindō-ryū (神道流) is acknowledged first in the genealogy of the Yagyu Shingan Ryu, followed by the other traditions of which Takenaga Hayato mastered.

Notalgia paresthetica

Notalgia paraesthetica or less correct "notalgia paresthetica" (also known as "Hereditary localized pruritus," "Posterior pigmented pruritic patch," and "Subscapular pruritus") is a chronic sensory neuropathy. Notalgia paraesthetica is a common localized itch, affecting mainly the interscapular area (especially the T2-T6 dermatomes) but occasionally with a more widespread distribution, involving the shoulders, back, and upper chest. The characteristic symptom is pruritus (itch or sensation that makes a person want to scratch) on the back, usually on the left hand side below the shoulder blade (mid to upper back). It is occasionally accompanied by pain, paresthesia (pins and needles), and/or hyperesthesia (unusual or pathologically increased sensitivity of the skin to sensory stimuli, such as pain, heat, cold, or touch), which results in a well circumscribed hyperpigmentation of a skin patch in the affected area.
The causes or origin of this condition (etiology) have not yet been completely defined. 
Patients are usually older persons[http://www.skinsight.com/adult/notalgiaParaesthetica.htm].
Causes.
The correlation of notalgia paraesthetica localization with corresponding degenerative changes in the spine suggest that spinal nerve impingement may be a contributing cause. According to Plete and Massey, "The posterior rami of spinal nerves arising in T2 through T6 are unique in that they pursue a right-angle course through the multifidus spinae muscle, and this particular circumstance may predispose them to harm from otherwise innocuous insults of a varied nature." Patients may have other conditions that predispose them to peripheral neuropathies (nerve damage).
Treatment.
Many treatments have been tried, including local anesthetics, topical corticosteroids, and topical capsaicin. Some patients treated with capsaicin reported pain, burning, or tingling sensations with treatment, and symptoms returned within a month of ceasing treatment. Oxcarbazepine was reported to have reduced severity of symptoms in a few cases, but this was a reduction of symptoms rather than a cure. One patient has been treated with "paravertebral nerve blocks, with bupivacaine and methylprednisolone acetate injected into the T3-T4 and T5-T6 intervertebral spaces" 
Hydroxyzine HCL has also been used with considerable success in some cases as long as the pills are used daily.
Medical Cannabis appears to relieve the symptoms. [http://www.steadyhealth.com/Intermittent_Crawling_and_Burning_Sensation_in_a_small_area_t121234.html?page=4 
Most recently intradermal injections of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) have been tried with some success. Even though botulinum normally wears off in three to six months, the treatment appears to be long term, and it has been theorised that botulinum type A effects lasting change in pain signaling. Unfortunately, repeated injections have been associated with diminished movement ability of the upper back and arms and its recommendation as a treatment has therefore become less popular.

Yes, Yes, Yes

"Yes, Yes, Yes" is a musical comedy/parody song co-written, recorded and released as a single in 1976 by comedian Bill Cosby. The song came from Cosby's 1976 album, "Bill Cosby Is Not Himself These Days". 
The song, which Cosby co-wrote with his longtime collaborator, Stu Gardner, spoofed Barry White's deep-voiced spoken-word sexual monologues but instead of a monologue of making love, Cosby constantly asked his wife if she took money off his pocket, destroyed the car she borrowed from him, if his checkbook was overdrawn and if she was cheating on him with a man "in his closet" wearing his pajamas. The female background vocalists constantly say "yes, yes, yes" to every one of Cosby's questions.
Throughout the song, Cosby would also repeat "rat own", mocking White's usage of "right on" in his songs.
Built under a quiet storm-like R&B production similar to White's, the song hit the charts peaking at number 46 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 11 on the R&B charts becoming Cosby's biggest charted single since "Little Ole Man (Uptight, Everything's Alright)" peaked at number four on the Hot 100 nine years earlier.

8&quot;/55 caliber Mark 71 gun

The U.S. Navy's Major Caliber Lightweight Gun (MCLWG) program was the 8"/55 caliber Mark 71 major caliber lightweight, single-barrel naval gun prototype (spoken "eight-inch-fifty-five-caliber") that was mounted aboard the in 1975 to test the capability of destroyer-sized ships to provide shore bombardment support with the range previously available from decommissioned cruisers. United States naval gun terminology indicates the gun fired a projectile in diameter, and the barrel was 55 calibers long (barrel length is 8" × 55 = 440" or 11.165 meters.)
Origin.
Gunfire support from cruisers and battleships had become an established part of United States amphibious warfare doctrine during World War II. As the last of the wartime cruisers and battleships were decommissioned, the 5"/54 caliber gun became the largest available for such assignments. The 5"/54 could fire a 70-pound (32-kg) projectile approximately 15 miles (24 km) in comparison to a range of 17 miles (27 km) for 260 pound (118 kg) projectiles from the 8"/55 caliber guns of heavy cruisers.
The impending loss of capability was anticipated by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) in 1969. CNO established a requirement for a new gun capable of firing semi-active laser guided projectiles (SAL GP). Development took place through 1971 and 1972 at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division.
Prototype.
The 8"/55 Mark 71 gun was a single gun adaptation of the 8"/55 Mark 16 gun found in triple turrets on "Des Moines" class cruisers. The prototype gun mount weighed 86 tons and was approximately 20 percent heavier than the 5"/54 caliber Mark 42 gun it replaced. The prototype could fire ten to twelve rounds per minute from a 75-round automatic ready service magazine for semi-fixed ammunition when operated by one man. A specially modified Mark 155 ballistic computer provided 8"/55 ballistics for "Hull"s Mark 68 gun fire control system.
Termination.
At-sea technical evaluation occurred aboard "Hull" in 1975, and operational testing followed through 1976. The Operational Test and Evaluation Force determined inaccuracy made the gun operationally unsuitable, and concluded the lightweight 8"/55 was no more effective than the 5"/54 (with Rocket Assisted Projectiles). The report recommended against production or installation of the lightweight 8"/55, and program funding was terminated in 1978. SAL GP development continued.

North Entrance Road Historic District

The North Entrance Road Historic District comprises Yellowstone National Park's North Entrance Road from Gardiner, Montana to the park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, a distance of a little over five miles (8 km). The North Entrance Road was the first major road in the park, necessary to join the U.S. Army station at Fort Yellowstone to the Northern Pacific Railroad at Gardiner. The road includes the Roosevelt Arch at the northern boundary of the park and winds through rolling terrain before crossing the Gardner River and joining the Grand Loop Road. The road was planned in 1883 by Lieutenant Dan Kingman of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and later on improved by Captain Hiram M. Chittenden of the Corps..

Novak Lo-Mount

The Novak Lo-Mount is a rear sight that is popular for use on many semi-automatic pistols, most commonly found on Colt 1911 style pistols but also used on Browning Hi-Power style pistols. The sight was designed by Wayne Novak of Parkersburg, WV and is manufactured by his company, Novak Designs, Inc. Though initially an aftermarket part, Novac sights (or in some cases copies of the same design) are today installed as OEM standard on many factory pistols, such as several Springfield 1911 models, as well as some Smith & Wesson pistols. The sight is available in either plain black, or a three dot or bar-dot pattern of either white dots or tritium lamps. There is also a "tall" version of this sight that is approximately .050" taller than the standard sight, developed for use on Officer's ACP-length guns, though it is also found on longer guns that have had match barrels fitted that now shoot a little lower than they did originally. Several sight manufacturers make copies of the Novak style sight, or variants of their own sight designs that fit the Novak dovetail.
Two of the most popular fixed sight installations are the Novak Lo-Mount and the Heinie Slant-Pro[http://www.heinie.com/slanteight.php].

Armstrong Whitworth Armadillo

The Armstrong Whitworth Armadillo was a British single-seat biplane fighter aircraft built by Armstrong Whitworth. 
Development and design.
The Armadillo was designed in 1917 by Armstrong Whitworth's new chief designer, Fred Murphy, as a private venture single-seat fighter powered by a Bentley BR2 rotary engine. While the design met the requirements of Air Board Specification A1(a) for a replacement for the Sopwith Camel, it was principally produced to test the abilities of Armstrong Whitworth's new design team, and was not considered a serious competitor for the requirement. Despite this, Armstrong Whitworth was granted a licence in January 1918 to allow construction of two prototypes.
The aircraft was a two-bay biplane with a square section fuselage. The engine in the nose was enclosed by a circular cowl with a deep hump above the cowl housing two .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns.
The first prototype made its maiden flight during April 1918. The type was not subject to formal evaluation by the Air Ministry, with the poor view from the cockpit being criticised. By the time the Armadillo appeared the Sopwith Snipe, powered by the same engine and faster was already in large scale production and Murphy had started work on the more advanced Ara fighter, so the Armadillo was abandoned, the second prototype not being completed.

Armstrong Whitworth Ara

The Armstrong Whitworth Ara was an unsuccessful British single-seat biplane fighter aircraft of the First World War built by Armstrong Whitworth.
Design and development.
In early 1918, the British Air Ministry wrote RAF Specification Type 1 for a single-seat fighter to replace the Sopwith Snipe. The specified engine was the ABC Dragonfly, a new radial engine which had been ordered into productioon based on promised performance before any testing had been carried out. To meet this specification, Armstrong Whitworth's chief designer, Fred Murphy, produced the Armstrong Whitworth Ara, three prototypes being ordered.
The Ara was a two-bay biplane. It had a square fuselage, the engine was covered in a pointed cowling, but with the cylinder heads exposed. The upper wing was low to give the pilot a better upwards view.
As with the other fighters built to meet the Type 1 specification, the Dragonfly engine proved to be the Ara's undoing, demonstrating hopeless reliability. Two of the three prototypes were completed, the first flying in mid-1919. The Ara was abandoned towards the end of the year when Armstrong Whitworth closed down its aircraft department.

Brooks lost another to Billy Fives on January 30, 1999. On March 20, he wrestled twice in one day losing to Schmuck Dudley during the day show and, with his father Rusty Brooks, defeated Schmuck & Snot Dudley in a tag team match during the night show. He also defeated "Super" Mario in Cooper City, Florida on May 1. That same month, he was part of FOW's first international tour to Peru from May 20–23. Although losing to Billy Fives during the first and last nights in Lima, Peru, he did beat Bobby Rogers and Prince Ali in a 3-way dance as well as defeating "Mr. Magnificent" Mike Monroe during the four-day tour. These shows were in front of 6,000, 9,000, 11,000 and 16,000 fans.
On June 26, Brooks fought Wet Willie to a no contest in Hollywood, Florida. The next month, he and Flex Magnum lost to Billy Fives & Soulman Alex G in Cape Coral, Florida on July 18. During the FOW's second tour to Peru, Brooks defeated Anthony Adonis for FOW International Championship on August 1. Two weeks later, he and his father defeated The Exterminators (Casey Thompson & Cliff Anderson) on August 14.
Brooks eventually lost the FOW International title to Billy Fives on September 25, however he did defeat Flex Magnum, Gator B. Long & Iron in a 6-man tag team match with Rusty and Bobby Brooks on November 6. At the end of the year, he lost to Chris Charger on December 30, 1999.
Participating in an 8-man progressive elimination match, Brooks was eliminated by Bruno Sassi on January 20, 2001. On May 12, he also took part in a Hardcore battle royal in Davie, Florida and, the next year, he appeared in an interpromotional event between Future of Wrestling and Rusty Brooks' Four Star Championship Wrestling on February 9, 2002. Appearing alongside FSCW wrestlers in a promo with FOW, he later interrupted a ladder match between Johnny, Tommy and Ricky Vandal entering the match himself and eventually winning the title when he powerbombed Johnny Vandal off the ladder and climbed the ladder to retrieve the title.
Brooks later lost the title at FOW's King of Carnage in front of 3,092 fans in the Davie Rodeo Arena to Al Bino in a 3-way dance with Johnny Vandal on April 13.This show featured many up and coming superstars as well as veterans including Dusty Rhodes, Terry Funk, Abdullah The Butcher, Kevin Sullivan, Billy Fives, Norman Smiley, Christopher Daniels, Low Ki/Senshi/Kuval, Antonio Banks/MVP, Barry Horrowitz, The Sandman, Bruno Sassi, The Vandals, Joey Matthews and so many more. Regaining the title from David Babylon mon an FSCW show in Oakland Park on July 27, he held the title only two weeks before losing the title on FOW TV Taping to Tommy Vandal in a match with David Babylon on August 10.
Later that year, he made an appearance for Nick Mayberry's Hardkore Championship Wrestling at the 2002 "Hardkore & Confused" supercard losing to "Extreme Shah" Hack Meyers at The HCPAC in Hollywood, Florida on October 12. Their match was considered by many in attendance as an impressive technical matchup as fans reportedly chanted ""five more minutes"". This was the first of several appearances that Brooks would make for the promotion over the next two years. On January 10, 2003, he made his second HCW appearance at the supercard "Hardkore Returns" fighting to a draw with Jimmy Rave at the Inverrary Hotel Ballroom in Lauderhill, Florida.
Four Star Championship Wrestling.
After the close of Future of Wrestling, Brooks joined his father's Four Star Championship Wrestling promotion full-time in late 2003. He soon formed a successful tag team with Ryan O'Reilly called the Irish Thug Connection and, on November 8, they defeated Phi Delta Slam (Big Tilly & Bruno Sassi) for the FOW Tag Team titles. Earlier that night, they had also defeated Michael Manix & Gus Quatro.
On April 10, Brooks lost to Scott Commodity in Boca Raton, Florida. Three months later however, he defeated Scott Commodity and Logan Casey in a 3-way match in Deerfield Beach, Florida on July 17. He was attacked by Flex Magnum following the match but was saved by Vampire Warrior and later teamed up to defeat Scott Commodity & Soulman Alex G later that night. On July 31, he made another appearance for Hardkore Championship Wrestling taking part in the 3rd annual "Incredible 8" tournament at the Bergeron Rodeo Arena in Davie, Florida and, in a match with Rusty Brooks as special referee, he was eliminated by Jimmy Rave in the opening rounds. Later that night, agreeing to help Nick Mayberry regain the HCW Hardcore title, Brooks took part in the first ever tag team match sanctioned by HCW teaming with Mayberry to beat The Power Company Twins. During the next several months, Brooks lost matches to The Blackhart, Scott Commodity and Soulman Alex G.
On April 23, 2005, in a match for the FSCW Light Heavyweight Title, he also lost to Norge Alvarez in a 3-way dance to Lowell Brown. However, defeating Lowell Brown on June 18, he received a title shot against Norge Alvarez beating him for the title less than a week later. On August 29, he appeared at another HCW card at the Pompano Beach Elks Lodge in Pompano Beach, Florida. The event also featured "The Genius" Lanny Poffo, Reckless Youth, "Shooter" Vordell Walker and Dagon Briggs as well as Tommy Vandal and Soulman Alex G.

Female epic

The female epic is a concept in literary criticism that seeks to expand generic boundaries by identifying ways in which women authors have adapted the masculine epic tradition to express their own heroic visions. 
Historically, epic literature has been considered an exclusively male domain, to the extent that "epic and masculinity appear to be almost coterminous." From Homer's Iliad to Milton's "Paradise Lost", the epic canon has been defined by works authored by men, and the characteristic subject matter and diction of the epic have carried connotations of masculinity. Recently, however, feminist literary critics have identified a number of texts written by women which, they argue, deserve to be considered epics, as they have many of the required qualities: emphasis on heroism, nation building, religious authority, a strong quest motif, and significant length. Because these texts post-date Milton’s "Paradise Lost" – conventionally considered to be the last authentic epic in the Western tradition – they are by default "modern epics".
However, argue these critics, this is by no means a contradiction. The epic remains an authentic and vital literary genre, and one to which women have made valuable contributions. 
The breadth of these studies is indicated by the essays in Bernard Schweizer's "Approaches to the Anglo and American Female Epic, 1621-1982" (2006), which features studies of, among others, Lady Mary Wroth’s "The Countesse of Montgomeries Urania", Mary Tighe’s "Psyche", Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s "Aurora Leigh", Sharon Doubiago’s "Hard Country", and Rebecca West’s "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon".

Depth of discharge

Depth of discharge (DOD) is an alternate method to indicate a battery's state of charge (SOC). The DOD is the complement of SOC: as one increases, the other decreases. While the SOC units are percent points (0% = empty; 100% = full), the units for DOD can be Ah (e.g.: 0 = full, 50 Ah = empty) or percent points (100% = empty; 0% = full). As a battery may actually have higher capacity than its nominal rating, it is possible for the DOD value to exceed the full value (e.g.: 52 Ah or 110%), something that is not possible when using SOC.

Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes

The History of the Two Valiant Knights, Sir Clyomon Knight of the Golden Shield, Son to the King of Denmark, and Clamydes the White Knight, Son to the King of Swabia is an early Elizabethan stage play, first published in 1599 but written perhaps three decades earlier (c. 1570). It is often regarded as a characteristic example — perhaps the best surviving example — of the type of drama that was extremely popular in the early Elizabethan period. The work "best represents the characteristics of pre-Greenian dramatic romance."
Publication.
"Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes" was first printed in 1599, in a quarto issued by stationer Thomas Creede. The title page makes no attribution of authorship; it does state that the play was "sundry time" performed by Queen Elizabeth's Men. That playing company originated in 1583; if the play is as old as some commentators judge it, the company's version must have been a revival.
Genre.
The play has been called a "comedy, or, more properly, tragicomedy," though it falls securely into the category of romance, an enormously popular genre in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. A modern reader or critic might classify it as an "adventure melodrama." 
"Clyomon and Camydes" is an extravagant example of stage romance. In his "Defense of Poetry", Sir Philip Sidney generally defended the poets and poems of his era from their critics; but in a famous and often-quoted passage he also ridiculed the fanciful and wild romances then common on the popular stage, in which:
A quick summary of the physical locations in this play confirms and even accentuates Sidney's description: the drama opens in Denmark, "and passes successively to Swabia, to the Forest of Marvels on the borders of Macedonia, to the Isle of Strange Marshes twenty days' sail from Macedonia, to the Forest again, to the Isle again, to Norway, to the Forest, to the Isle, to the Forest, to a road near Denmark, to the Isle, to Denmark."
Verse.
The play is composed in the rhymed fourteener or heptameter verse that was popular in its era. When the heroine Neronis (daughter of Patranius, late King of the Isle of Strange Marshes) enters the Forest of Marvels in male disguise, she speaks this:
The meter has a jog-trot rhythm to a modern ear, but poets like Sidney and Arthur Golding employed it for works of serious intent.
Authorship.
There is no evidence from the Elizabethan era to indicate the author of "Sir Clymon and Sir Clamydes." Scholars and critics have proposed George Peele, Thomas Preston, Robert Wilson, and one Richard Bower. No convincing case has been made for any single candidate.
Shakespeare.
Crude as it is, "Clyomon and Clamydes" is thought to have had an influence on several of Shakespeare's plays. Most notably, Rosalind in "As You Like It" disguises herself in male clothing and flees courtly life for residence among simple shepherds — just as Neronis does in her play. In "A Midsummer Night's Dream", the playlet of the mechanicals in Act V bears a resemblance with "Clyomon and Clamydes", though in this case the resemblance is clearly in a spirit of parody. And the late romance "Cymbeline" bears a significant relationship with "Clyomon and Clamydes". Shakespeare uses a personified figure of Rumour as a Chorus at the start of "Henry IV, Part 2;" the same figure appears in "Clyomon and Clamydes".
Synopsis.
Clamydes, son of the King of Swabia, has a problem: he cannot marry his beloved, Juliana, until he slays a dragon that has been killing and eating maidens and matrons. Clamydes must bring Juliana the severed head of the "flying serpent." Juliana's brother Clyomon, son of the King of Denmark, takes Clamydes' place when the Suavian king is knighting his son — effectively stealing his brother-in-law-to-be's knighthood. 
Sir Clyomon sets off on his knightly adventures, which lead him to the Macedonia of Alexander the Great (a figure commonly featured in chivalric romance). Clamydes pursues Clyomon, seeking revenge for his stolen knighthood; meanwhile he kills the dragon in an offstage fight. But he falls victim to the spells of the evil magician Bryan Sans Foy, who steals Clamydes' arms and apparel (and his dragon's head). Bryan intends to take Clamydes' place and marry Juliana. 
Clyomon is driven by storms to the Isle of Strange Marshes; he falls in love with the princess Neronis. He vows his fealty to her — and returns to his adventures. (He has sworn to meet and fight with Clamydes, so his knightly honor compels him.) Thrasellus, the King of Norway, also loves Neronis; she has rejected him, and so he kidnaps her. She, however, escapes for him, and in male disguise seeks refuge with the shepherd Corin. (Neronis is "the earliest known example of a girl disguised as a page" in English Renaissance drama, making her the ancestress of Lyly's Gallathea and Phillida, Shakespeare's Rosalind and Viola, and all their successors.) Clyomon tries to rescue Neronis; he meets, fights, and kills Thrasellus. Yet since the man is a king, Clyomon gives him an honorable burial, decorating the hearse with his own shield. Neronis finds hearse and shield, and mistakes the dead man for Clyomon. In grief, she sings a song and tries to kill herself with Clyomon's sword — when Providence descends from the heavens to stop her. He assures her that she will find her living beloved soon. Neronis, still in boy's clothes, takes service as page with a disguised Clyomon.
After their abundant adventures, problems are resolved in the end. The two knights become friends when Clamydes realizes that Clyomon is a prince of Denmark and Juliana's brother; they return north. Neronis realizes that she is working for the man she loves. Clamydes chases away the cowardly Bryan Sans Foy. Neronis reveals her true identity. The couples plan their weddings as the play concludes.

<doc id="18820190" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18820190" title="Community Legal Centre">
Community Legal Centre

Community Legal Centres (CLCs) are independent organisations aiming to advance legal–and, by extension, social and political–equality by making the law accessible to the poor and otherwise marginalised in Australia. They provide legal advice to individuals and take on traditional casework. However, CLC workers and volunteers are also active in other, diverse, areas through which they attempt to realise systemic change. For example, they lobby for law reform, undertake test case litigation, critique police powers and behaviours, monitor prisons systems and conditions, and develop community education programs. These programs may include anything from published books and pamphlets to radio programs and conference presentations.
Ethos.
Community legal centres emphasise the demystification of the law and the empowerment of communities in their relation to the law, particularly by encouraging communities to be involved in their activities. For example, they often adopt constitutions mandating close consultation with the communities they serve, and insist upon harnessing the skills and expertise of ‘non-lawyers’ (e.g. social workers, administrators, or ‘everyday’ people with good communicative or special language skills) as well as lawyers. Additionally, their education programs are often preventative: that is, they aim to give people skills to solve their own problems without recourse to lawyers.
Funding.
Community Legal Centres are partly funded by a complex and variable mix of state and federal government monies, offered both directly (e.g. through grants) and indirectly (e.g. through legal aid). They are also funded by the proceeds of casework. However, they rely most heavily upon the efforts and support of extensive volunteer networks. Without the willingness of both lawyers and non-lawyers to staff them without payment, they would not survive.
History.
CLCs first developed in Victoria in the early 1970s, but spread quite rapidly through the other states. There are currently more than 160 CLCs in operation across Australia (Noone 2001: 132). Although from the outset they shared some similarities with the already established American and British neighbourhood law offices, in their insistence upon effecting systemic change and their largely voluntary support base they had characteristics distinct from each. They can be understood to have grown out of broader concerns for social justice that gained momentum in the 1960s and which found expression in the anti-war and women’s movements, aboriginal rights campaigns, and other pushes for far-reaching social change in both the Australian and global contexts (Chesterman 1996: 11-43). However, CLCs are a unique expression of these social justice and protest movements and do not claim particular ties to any other campaigns. Furthermore, while some CLCs have developed close links with others, centres for the most part serve their own particular geographic or special interest communities. This means that throughout their history different CLCs have usually held common platforms in only general, rather than specific, terms.
When the first Victorian CLCs were established, they were often resisted by a legal establishment that was defensive about CLCs’ criticisms of the elitism or inaccessibility of the legal professions, suspicious of CLCs’ aims and methods, and concerned about protecting profits (Chesterman 1996: 69-70, 77-83; Noone and Tomsen 2006: 73; Greenwood 1994: 3-5). However, soon after the Fraser Liberal government came to power in December 1975, some members of the wider legal profession had begun to acknowledge the importance of CLCs in improving the public’s access to the law (Chesterman 1996: 87). Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, CLCs consolidated their position in the Victorian and wider Australian legal landscape, forging (sometimes fraught) ties with different government and legal organisations (such as various state legal aid commissions).
Today, CLCs hold an established, if in funding terms sometimes precarious, place in the Victorian and wider Australian legal scene and have shaped the legal profession in various ways, although these are difficult to identify and quantify. For example, some larger Victorian law firms now permit–even encourage–employees to undertake some voluntary work, most often in the area of individual casework. This certainly testifies to wider community demands for adequate representation for all before the law, and to increasing pressures for law firms to be responsible ‘corporate citizens’, and the former development in particular may be attributed partly to the work of CLCs. However, the private legal profession has arguably been less responsive to CLCs’ attempts to bring about broader and more fundamental changes in the ways the law and lawyers operate.

Conor O'Brian

Ryan Parmeter (born February 6, 1980) is an American professional wrestler better known by his ring name Conor O'Brian. He is signed by WWE, where he is working in their developmental territory NXT Wrestling as Konnor. He was part of the fourth season of "NXT", and earned fourth place on the show's fifth season, "NXT Redemption".
After spending four years wrestling on the independent circuit as Ryan Payne O'Reilly, Parmeter signed a WWE contract in 2005, and was assigned to Deep South Wrestling (DSW), a developmental territory, where he wrestled as Rough House O'Reilly. He won the DSW Heavyweight Championship twice, before briefly appearing in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). He also appeared in several dark matches prior to "Raw" and "SmackDown", and at several ECW house shows. In October 2007, both Parmeter and his girlfriend, Krissy Vaine, requested to be released from their WWE contracts for personal reasons.
Following his release, Parmeter took time off from wrestling, before debuting for NWA Charlotte in February 2009. In July 2010, he was re-signed by WWE, and returned to FCW where he began wrestling as Conor O'Brian. In November 2010, he was announced as a participant in the fourth season of "NXT".
Professional wrestling career.
Early career (2001–2005).
Parmeter initially trained at the School of Hard Knocks in southern Florida under Rusty Brooks, and made his professional wrestling debut in 2001. He went on to compete in Brooks' promotion, Four Star Championship Wrestling (FSCW) as Ryan Payne O'Reilly, and formed a tag team with Jeff "J-Dawg" Brooks, known as the "Irish Thug Connection". Together, the Irish Thug Connection won the FSCW Tag Team Championship. He also won the FSCW Heavyweight Championship, and spent mid-2004 feuding with Norman Smiley over it. O'Reilly also competed for Florida's Coastal Championship Wrestling (CCW) promotion, and won the CCW Heavyweight Championship. He appeared for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling during the promotion's early shows.
World Wrestling Entertainment (2005–2008).
After four years on the independent circuit, O'Reilly signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2005. He was assigned to Deep South Wrestling (DSW), a WWE developmental territory as Rough House O'Reilly, and made his DSW debut at the inaugural DSW show on September 1, in a loss to Jack Bull. Over the next several months, he faced wrestlers including "Big Time" Nick Mitchell, Mike Mizanin, Shawn Schultz, Derrick Neikirk, Eric Perez and Freakin Deacon. In December, he appeared in a dark match prior to the "SmackDown!" tapings.
In early 2006, O'Reilly took a leave of absence. Upon his return, he and Danny Germundo entered a tournament for the DSW Tag Team Championship but were eliminated by Team Elite (Mike Knox and Neikirk) on May 11. On June 22, O'Reilly defeated Neikirk to win the DSW Heavyweight Championship. He successfully defended the championship against Knox, Neikirk, and Montel Vontavious Porter. On September 7, O'Reilly lost the championship to Bradley Jay. During mid-2006, O'Reilly made several appearances at ECW house shows, teaming with Neikirk to faceThe FBI (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke). O'Reilly was scheduled to become part of the regular ECW roster in September, but violated the WWE Wellness Program, and was suspended for 30 days.
When he returned, he became the personal assistant of DSW General Manager Krissy Vaine. In December, O'Reilly appeared on an episode of "ECW on Sci Fi" as one of Paul Heyman's personal enforcers alongside Doug Basham. In March 2007, O'Reilly won the DSW Heavyweight Championship for the second time. He lost the championship back to Bradley Jay a week later. O'Reilly and Eric Perez were originally scheduled to face The Samoans (Afa, Jr. and Sonny Siaki) in the main event of DSW's final event, but he and Perez were replaced by The Major Brothers. During mid-2007, O'Reilly would appear in dark matches prior to "Raw" and "SmackDown" against Sylvan Grenier, Chuck Palumbo, Super Crazy, Cody Rhodes and D'Lo Brown. He briefly appeared in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), another WWE developmental territory, where both Lacey Von Erich and Maryse acted as his valets.
In October 2007, both Parmeter and his girlfriend Krissy Vaine requested and were granted their release from WWE. They cited health problems suffered by members of both of their families as the reason.
Time off and independent circuit (2007–2009).
In October 2007, Parmeter stated that he was taking time off from wrestling. He returned to wrestling in February 2009, working for NWA Charlotte. He wrestled against Truitt Fields for the territory's Heavyweight Championship, but was unable to win the title. After the loss, O'Reilly formed an alliance with Mikael Judas and Phill Shatter called III, which lasted until the territory's closure.
Return to World Wrestling Entertainment.
Developmental territories and NXT (2010–present).
Parmeter was re-signed by the WWE on July 14, 2010, and was reassigned to the FCW developmental territory. On August 12, he debuted for Florida Championship Wrestling as Ryan O'Riley losing to Conrad Tanner. He would compete under this name for a short while before becoming Conor O'Brian on September 30.
On November 30, 2010, during the season finale of season three of "NXT", it was announced that Parmeter, under the name Conor O'Brian, would be appearing on season four, with Alberto Del Rio as his mentor. He made his in-ring debut on "NXT" the following week, teaming with Del Rio to defeat rookie Derrick Bateman and Bateman's mentor Daniel Bryan. O'Brian won his first challenge on the January 4, 2011 episode of "NXT", when he won the 'Battle of the Mic Challenge' to earn four immunity points. Two weeks later, on January 18, O'Brian was the second contestant eliminated from "NXT". Earlier that night, O'Brian competed in a match against Ricardo Rodriguez in a losing effort.
In March 2011, O'Brian was selected as one of the six former "NXT" contestants to return to the show in its fifth season, "NXT Redemption". During this season, O'Brian was mentored by Vladimir Kozlov. He was later eliminated from competition on the June 28, 2011 episode of "NXT", and would later be joined, and eventually replaced, by a returning Derrick Bateman and Daniel Bryan.
On August 28, 2011, Ricardo Rodriguez announced the formation of a stable called The Ascension, with members including O'Brian, Kenneth Cameron, Tito Colon and Raquel Diaz. The first match to include all members in some capacity came on September 1, 2011, and saw Cameron, Colon and O’Brian, accompanied by Diaz, defeating CJ Parker, Donny Marlow and Johnny Curtis. On September 30, Cameron and Colon had a shot at the FCW Tag Team Championship but lost to the current champions of CJ Parker and Donny Marlow. By October, however, video packages appeared promoting the Ascension under new seemingly demonic, supernatural characters, and did not include Rodriguez as he was disassociated from the team. By the end of November the Ascension had all but disbanded because O'Brian was injured, Colon had been called up to WWE to team with his cousin Primo, and Diaz became Queen of FCW and distanced herself from the group. This left Cameron as the sole survivor of the Ascension, continuing to use the Ascension gimmick during his appearances. On March 15, 2012, O'Brian returned accompanying Cameron to the ring in his match against Byron Saxton; the match ended in disqualification when O'Brian interfered. Cameron and O'Brian began wrestling as a tag team using the name The Ascension, and their first tag team match together came on March 23 when the two defeated Jason Jordan and Xavier Woods. The Ascension suffered their first loss when the pair lost to the FCW Tag Team Champions, Corey Graves and Jake Carter, in a title bout.
With the conclusion of "NXT Redemption", WWE rebranded its developmental territory, FCW, into NXT Wrestling. O'Brian and Cameron, as the Ascension, debuted on the first episode of the rebooted "WWE NXT" taped at Full Sail University, where they defeated Mike Dalton and CJ Parker. The Ascension then started a feud with the Usos, defeating them on the September 5 "NXT", and also scored a win over Justin Gabriel and Tyson Kidd on the October 3 "NXT". Two weeks later, the Ascension teamed up with Kassius Ohno to defeat Richie Steamboat and the Usos. The Ascension disbanded on November 30, 2012 when Cameron was released from WWE.
O'Brian retained his character while using "The Ascension" as his nickname as he started to feud with Big E Langston for the NXT Championship. O'Brian first faced Langston in a non-title match, which ended in a double disqualification. O'Brian then faced Corey Graves in a number one contender match which had no winner when the Shield attacked both men to make a statement. The next week, O'Brian defeated Graves and Bo Dallas to become the number one contender. The feud ended after O'Brian was defeated in a title match on the April 4 episode of "NXT". On the May 29 "NXT", O'Brian competed in an 18-man number one contender battle royal and was eliminated by Corey Graves and Kassius Ohno. To reform the Ascension tag team, Rick Victor allied himself with O'Brian as they went chased the NXT Tag Team Championships held by Adrian Neville and Corey Graves. On November 10, 2013 O'Brian's name was tweaked and shortened to "Konnor".
On February 27th 2014 at NXT Arrival, he and Rick Victor successfully defended the NXT Tag Team Championships against Too Cool.
Personal life.
Parmeter began dating Kristin Eubanks in 2006. In an interview in October 2007, Parmeter announced the two were engaged. They later married in June 2013.

Austin Greyhound

The Austin Greyhound was a British two-seat biplane fighter aircraft of World War I built by car manufacturer Austin. Owing to the end of the War and an unreliable engine, it was unsuccessful, only three being built.
Development and design.
In 1918, Britain's Royal Air Force issued the Type III specification for a replacement for the Bristol F.2 Fighter to be powered by the new ABC Dragonfly radial engine. The Austin Motor Company, who had produced large numbers of aircraft, including 800 Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, submitted a design by J Kenworthy, formerly of the Royal Aircraft Factory, which was named the Austin Greyhound. An order for three prototypes was placed on 18 May 1918.
The Greyhound was a two-bay biplane of all-wooden construction. The Greyhound's engine was covered by a conical cowling, with the cylinder heads protruding. The circular shape of the cowling continued down the fuselage. The upper and lower wings were almost the same size.
While the first prototype was quickly built, problems with the Dragonfly engine, which was found to be overweight and underpowered, and to have unsolvable reliability problems, meant that testing was delayed, with the second prototype being delivered to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham Heath in January 1919, being followed by the first prototype in May and the third in February 1920. Although performance was good no production was ordered of any of the competitors, with the Bristol Fighter remaining in service until 1932. The last Greyhound remained in use as a flying test bed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough until June 1922.

Tarpley carbine

The Tarpley Carbine was a Confederate weapon produced and used during the American Civil War, however, it was not produced in great numbers. The Tarpley Carbine was a breechloader, and was comparable in this sense to the Sharps Rifle and Carbine more widely used by the Union.
On Civil War Artillery, there are some notes about the Carbine's manufacture:
"The breech-loading carbine was invented and patented in Greensboro, N.C. by Jere H. Tarpley. He received a C.S.A. patent on February 14, 1863, and his name appears on the barrel tang. He joined J. &F. Garrett & Co. to make carbines for the state of North Carolina. The carbines were made for about one year with their production amounting to only a few hundred. The carbine had a unique design which enabled this arm to be made with a file. The frame was unfinished brass with a copper color. The barrel was blued and the hammer was case hardened. The major flaw in the carbine was that it does not have a gas seal to prevent the escape of highly erosive gases between the breech-block and the barrel when fired. With each firing, the gap between the breech-block and the barrel would be larger. The carbine used paper ammunition. Although the carbine was made mainly for the state, it was also sold commercially. It is the only Confederate firearm sold to the public. The Tarpley was attractive in appearance, but it was not very serviceable. Clap, Gates & Co. was ten miles from the Garrett operation in Greensboro. The hammer and other parts could have been supplied by Clapp, Gates & Co." Dates of production, 1863-1864, total production, 'few hundred'."

List of primate cities

A primate city is a major city that works as the financial, political, and population center of a country and is not rivaled in any of these aspects by any other city in that country. Normally, a primate city must be at least twice as populous as the second largest city in the country. The presence of a primate city in a country usually indicates an imbalance in development — usually a progressive core, and a lagging periphery, on which the primate city depends for labor and other resources. Not all countries have primate cities (United States, Germany, India, and the People's Republic of China, for example), but in those that do, the rest of the country depends on it for cultural, economic, political, and major transportation needs. Among the best known examples of primate cities are the alpha world cities of London and Paris. Other major primate cities include Athens, Baghdad, Bangkok, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Lima, Mexico City, Seoul, Tehran, and Vienna.
Some examples of nations without a primate city would include India, with the six main cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Chennai; Canada, whose capital city, Ottawa, is overshadowed by the larger global cities of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver; Brazil, whose capital and political center, Brasilia, is dwarfed in size and culture by São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte; Italy, whose political seat at Rome is balanced by its business, financial, and fashion "capital" of Milan; Australia, which has the two main cities of Melbourne and Sydney, while the political centre resides in the smaller city of Canberra; South Africa, with three official capitals in Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein, each housing a different branch of government, and whose main commercial centre is yet another city, Johannesburg; and the United States, whose financial and cultural centers are widely dispersed throughout the country in cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago and whose political center is located in Washington, D.C. Germany is unique, in that the Berlin political center is somewhat weak. Several major government institutions are spread throughout the country, in cities like Bonn (the former capital) and Karlsruhe (seat of the federal constitutional court). Likewise, Frankfurt is its most important financial centre, but has significant competition from Düsseldorf and Munich. Germany's cultural center is split between Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Dresden, and smaller cities. Additionally, Mumbai, São Paulo, Ho Chi Minh City, Sydney, and Berlin have close competitors as their countries' largest cities (Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Hanoi, Melbourne, and Hamburg respectively). However, Berlin was considered as a primate city of Germany in the years 1871-1945.
Whether primate cities or not, alpha cities tend to produce a large percentage of their countries' respective gross domestic product (GDP) and gross metropolitan product (GMP), though primate cities tend to have a larger economic influence individually over a country. The three largest world metros consisting of a combined statistical area (CSA), by GMP, are the Greater Tokyo, New York, and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. Each of these cities have a GMP approaching the $1 trillion mark. This is largely due to the vast amounts of trade, finance, manufacturing, fashion, media, science, research and technology, transportation (air, ocean/shipping, land), warehousing, and other industries that provide jobs and end products on mass scales with easy access to worldwide markets and other alpha and primate cities. In addition many multinational corporations are headquartered in many alpha and primate cities.
Some countries, such as the United States, Australia and Canada, have regional and/or provincial/state primate cities, such as Atlanta, Georgia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Perth in Western Australia.

Phenacyl

In organic chemistry, a phenacyl group is an aromatic substituent that consists of a phenyl group attached to an acyl group. A molecule containing a phenacyl group has the formula RCH2(CO)C6H5 and the structure shown to the right. Here, "R" denotes the remainder of the molecule; for instance, if R is Br, then the compound could be called "phenacyl bromide". Note however that in the standard IUPAC nomenclature this compound would instead be called "2-bromo-1-phenylethanone".

Morgan v. United States (1885)

Morgan v. United States, , was a case involving several judgments of the United States Court of Claims in four cases against the United States for the payment of United States bonds known as "five-twenty bonds."
Consols of 1865, issued in pursuance of the authority conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury by the Act of Congress approved March 3, 1865, entitled "An act to provide ways and means for the support of the government." Twenty bonds of the denomination of $1,000 each and sixteen of $500 each were embraced in the suits. The controversy relates to the title only, all of them being claimed by the Manhattan Savings Institution, and ten of each denomination by J.S. Morgan & Co., and the others, being ten of $1,000 each and six of $500 each, by L. Von Hoffman & Co. The bonds having been called in for redemption, were presented at the Treasury for that purpose by the holders, respectively, J.S. Morgan & Co. and L. Von Hoffman & Co., but payment was refused by the United States on account of the adverse claim of the Manhattan Savings Institution, and the claims of the several parties to the proceeds were Treasury, March 12, 1880, pursuant to § 1063, Revised Statutes. Judgments were rendered by that court in favor of the Manhattan Savings Institution, and against the other claimants respectively. 18 Ct.Cl. 386. The several appeals bring up all the cases as they stood in the Court of Claims; the United States appealing from the judgment in favor of the Manhattan Savings Institution, the other parties from the judgments dismissing their respective petitions. The controversy is wholly between the claimants, the United States being merely in the position of a stakeholder, not denying its liability to pay to the true owners of the bonds.
The act of Congress in pursuance of which the bonds in question were issued, being "An act to provide ways and means for the support of the government," approved March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 468, c. 77, provided:
The bonds issued under this act were called the consolidated debt or consols of 1865, because, in addition to the loan of six hundred millions of dollars authorized by it, the Secretary of the Treasury was empowered to permit the conversion, into any description of bonds authorized by it, of any Treasury notes or other obligations, bearing interest, issued under any act of Congress.
The bonds were only different only in numbers and denomination, and were in the following form:
The bonds were known as "five-twenty bonds," because they were redeemable after five years but not payable until twenty years after July 1, 1865. 
The Act of July 14, 1870, "to authorize the refunding of the national debt," 16 Stat. 272, authorized the issue of three classes of bonds, according as they bore interest at the rates of five percent, 4½ percent, and 4 percent per annum, amounting in the aggregate to $1,500,000,000, which the Secretary of the Treasury was, by the second section of the act, authorized to sell and dispose of at not less than their par value in coin, and "to apply the proceeds thereof to the redemption of any of the bonds of the United States outstanding, and known as five-twenty bonds at their par value," or, the act continues, "he may exchange the same for such five-twenty bonds, par for par."
By the fourth section of this act, it was provided:
By an Act passed January 20, 1871, 16 Stat. 399, the foregoing act was amended so as to authorize the issue of five hundred millions of five percent bonds instead of two hundred millions, as limited by the Act of July 14, 1870, but not so as to permit an increase of the aggregate of bonds of all classes thereby authorized.
On March 1, 1871, the nearest date prior to the commencement of operations under the Refunding Act of 1870, the following amounts of six percent five-twenty bonds were outstanding: 
Of these, large amounts were held abroad by investors in foreign countries, and had been dealt in by bankers in the principal money centers of the world. It was expected and desired by Congress that this should be so, as the Secretary of the Treasury had been expressly authorized by law to dispose of any of the bonds of the United States, "either in the United States or elsewhere." Act March 3, 1865, § 2. And under the Refunding Act of July 14, 1870, as we have already seen, the Secretary of the Treasury established an agency in London for the purpose of delivering the bonds sold under that act and receiving in exchange therefor the outstanding securities of the United States agreed to be received in payment therefor. The object of this great exchange was to reduce the annual interest on the public debt of the United States from six to the lower rates of five, four and one-half, and four percent. To have called in the redeemable debt and paid for it in gold coin, and to have obtained the gold coin for that purpose by sales of the new securities, would have been awkward, circuitous, and impracticable, involving the needless export and import of a mass of the gold coin distributed by the necessities of the world's commerce throughout its markets, the attempt to do which would have produced disturbances of market values, certain to have defeated it. Any transfer of specie in large amounts to meet balances occasioned by these operations would have been almost as serious in its effects, and was therefore by every consideration of public and private interests to be avoided. The difficult practical question was how to avoid it—how to substitute in the markets of the world one loan for the other by an exchange of securities without any serious and disturbing movement of coin. Congress had placed it within the power of the Secretary of the Treasury to accomplish this by authorizing him to receive the five-twenty bonds, to be redeemed in exchange at par for the bonds to be issued at a lower rate of interest. This he was enabled to do by calling in the five-twenty bonds for redemption, by which they were made equal in value as money to par and interest then due and by agreeing to treat and receive them as money in the exchange. This created a demand for the "called bonds" to be used for that purpose, and they were bought from the holders by bankers and agents of the syndicates who had contracted to place the new loans under the act of 1870. This transaction could only have been successfully effected upon the assumption that the call for redemption did not affect the negotiable quality of the bonds, nor impose upon them any disability except the cessation of interest after the maturity of the call, nor deprive them of any other immunity which had previously belonged to them. On the contrary, it must have been within the contemplation of the Treasury Department and of those with whom it was dealing that the "called bonds," until finally absorbed by payments into the Treasury in exchange for new bonds, which constituted the fact of redemption, were equivalent in all legal qualities to money itself or to those usual equivalents of money which circulate, without question as such, like Treasury notes, payable on demand. And this view, we have already seen, the parties were authorized and justified in adopting by the language and purposes of the statutes under which the transactions were accomplished. By this means, an enormous public debt was shifted and converted, so as largely to reduce the burden of its interest; the agents of the government were facilitated in the great work they had undertaken; the individual holders of the securities of the United States, scattered throughout the countries of Europe, received the money due them on the bonds for which they subscribed at their own domiciles, and this series of great financial operations was successfully accomplished without interference with the usual course of the business of the world, without disturbing the fixed distribution of currency which commerce had apportioned to its appropriate markets, and without unsettling the value of property or labor either at home or abroad. These beneficial results were greatly facilitated, if not made feasible, by the unquestioned negotiability of the called bonds, which, when subjected to the right of redemption reserved by their terms, were thereafter considered and treated as the equivalent of money. This could not have been if the principles which protect bona fide purchasers for value, in the due course of trade, without actual notice of a defect in the obligation or title, had not been practically adopted. The practice as found to have existed was in our opinion well warranted by law.
This confidence was invited by the convenience of the government itself, and certainly promoted its interests and advanced its purposes. The practice it engendered on the part of the public dealing in its securities had been expressly sanctioned by formal recognition and approval by the Treasury Department long prior to the negotiation of the war loans, which commenced in 1862. In 1860, Attorney General Black officially advised the Secretary of the Treasury, 9 Opinions 413, that Treasury notes, redeemable after one year from date, interest thereon to cease at the expiration thereafter of sixty days' notice of readiness to pay and redeem the same, were intended to be a continuing security and to pass by delivery, after the period of redemption equally as before, as money or banknotes not liable to any equities between the original or intermediate parties.
It was by force of such a custom declared by Lord Selborne
The several judgments of the Court of Claims in these cases were reversed, and the causes are remanded to that court with directions to render judgments in accordance with this opinion.

Fujian Fleet

The Fujian Fleet ( or ) was one of China's four regional fleets during the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The fleet was almost annihilated on 23 August 1884 by Admiral Amédée Courbet's Far East Squadron at the Battle of Fuzhou, the opening engagement of the Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885).
Composition.
The Fujian Fleet, which would be the main target of the French attack in August 1884, was considerably weaker than the Beiyang Fleet and the Nanyang Fleet, though slightly stronger than the Guangdong Fleet. Nearly all of its ships were elderly products of the Foochow Navy Yard. Its flagship, the wooden corvette "Yangwu", was built in 1872. The other Chinese-built ships included the wooden gunboats "Fuxing" and "Zhenwei" (1870 and 1872), the wooden transports "Fupo", "Feiyun", "Ji'an", "Yongbao" and "Chenhang" (all built in 1874 or earlier), and the despatch vessel "Yixin". The fleet also included two British-built ships, the 256-ton Rendel ‘flatiron’ gunboats "Jiansheng" and "Fusheng", which had been ordered by the southern trade commissioner Shen Baozhen in the wake of the Japanese incursion into southern Taiwan in 1874 and were built at Laird’s yard in Birkenhead in 1875.
"Table 1: Ships of the Fujian Fleet (listed according to date of construction)"
The Battle of Fuzhou.
Nine of the eleven vessels of the Fujian Fleet were destroyed in less than an hour during the Battle of Fuzhou (23 August 1884). The Chinese flagship "Yangwu" was successfully attacked with a spar torpedo and grounded. The despatch vessel "Fuxing" was also attacked, less successfully, with spar torpedoes, and was finally carried by boarding. She had already been set alight by French shellfire, and was eventually abandoned by the French prize crew and sank in the middle of the Min River. "Zhenwei" was blown up by a single shell from the ironclad "Triomphante", which joined the French squadron minutes before the battle began. "Chenhang", "Yongbao", "Feiyun", "Ji'an", "Fusheng" and "Jiansheng" were either sunk or set alight by shellfire from the cruisers "Duguay-Trouin", "Villars" and "d’Estaing". Only "Fupo" and "Yixin" survived the battle without serious damage, by escaping upriver before the French ships had a chance to engage them.
Fleet acquisitions after 1885.
The Fujian Fleet never recovered from the loss of most of its ships in the Sino-French War. During the following decade it acquired several new ships, but it was never as large again as it was in 1884. The composite sloop "Henghai" (橫海) was completed at the Foochow Navy Yard in late 1885 and entered service with the Fujian Fleet. The sloop, which had been lying on the slips at the Foochow Navy Yard in August 1884, had been holed by French gunfire in the Battle of Fuzhou (23 August 1884), but the Chinese seem to have repaired the damage rapidly. "Henghai" served with the Fujian Fleet for less than a year. She ran aground off the Pescadores Islands on 30 March 1886 in thick fog, and broke up several days later during a gale after efforts by the warships "Fupo" (伏波) and "Wannianqing" (萬年清) to refloat her had failed.
In 1893 the 2,200-ton steel torpedo boat "Fujing" (福靖) was completed at the Foochow Navy Yard and joined the Fujian Fleet. She was sent north during the Sino-Japanese War to assist the Beiyang Fleet, but returned to Fujian in 1896 without having seen action. She sank in a storm near Port Arthur in 1898.

Death in the Woods

Death in the Woods is a 1933 short story collection by Sherwood Anderson. It was the last of Anderson's books to be published by Boni & Liveright before the firm's financial collapse. Most of the stories in the collection were previously published either in magazines ("Why They Got Married" appeared in the March 1929 issue of "Vanity Fair", for example, and "A Meeting South" was first published in "The Dial" of April 1925) and books (versions of "Death in the Woods" and "A Meeting South" were included in "" and "Sherwood Anderson's Notebook" (both 1926), respectively). According to John Earl Bassett, most of the stories in "Death in the Woods" were written between 1926 and 1930 with four preceding that time and one following. 
The Stories.
The collection is made up of 16 stories:
Plot of the title story.
"Death in the Woods" is presented as a first-person narrative by an unreliable narrator, who tells the story of an old woman, Mrs. Grimes. Mrs. Grimes lives on the edge of society and survives by selling eggs and using the proceeds to buy food for herself, her small family and the animals in her care. Her husband is considered to be a horse thief, and the couple is looked down on by others.
Mrs. Grimes' personal history, according to the narrator, is that she was abandoned by her mother and grew up as an indentured servant. It is suggested that there she received inappropriate attentions from her German master. The master's wife was suspicious and perhaps cruel toward her. Mrs. Grimes agrees to marry Jake Grimes, who "helps" her escape her German master and his wife. 
Mrs. Grimes and Jake Grime have a son and a daughter, but the daughter died in childhood. The narrator tells us that their son grows up to be like his father. Both of them verbally abused Mrs. Grimes and treat her in a manner similar to the way the German and his wife had treated her. She does not know life could be any different as this is all she ever experienced, according to the narrator. Her main concern in life is taking care of, and feeding the animals and people in her care. Her duty, she feels, is to feed animal life.
On the last day of her life, Mrs. Grimes walks into town to trade some eggs and buy some meager supplies. Her dogs follow her into town. According to the narrator, the butcher was unusually friendly and compassionate on this visit (because of the snowy, cold weather), giving her some extra liver and speaking to her kindly. She begins her walk home late in the day.
On her way home, she leaves the road and walks through the woods, probably a short cut. On this shortcut she reaches a clearing where she sits down to rest. While sitting down, she dies. The dogs, that had been following her, run around her in circles, then rip the pack away from her and devour the food inside.
The body is discovered by a hunter, who goes into town and tells everyone about the body in the woods. A group of men and some boys, including the narrator, walk into the woods to examine the body and bring it back.
When the narrator and his brother return home, the older brother tells the story. Our narrator set down his version of the story many years later, because he felt that his brother had not been able to properly and efficiently explain the events.
There are other stories that are re-tellings of events or stories told by unreliable narrators- meaning they do not necessary give readers accurate, cold-hard facts. The stories are from their points-of-view, or how they interpret the events or happenings. It is their "working out" of their past experiences.

Len Choa

Len Choa is a two-player abstract strategy game observed in 19th-century Siam. It is a Leopard hunt game (or Leopard game). One tiger is going up against six leopards. The leopards attempt to surround and trap the tiger while the tiger attempts to capture enough of them (usually 3) so that the leopards can not immobilize the tiger. It is unknown how old the game is, however, the game was published by Captain Low in the periodical Asiatic Researches, 1836. There is a very similar game played in Sri Lanka called Hat diviyan keliya. The only difference is that there are seven leopards instead.
Goal.
Leopards win if they surround and immobilize the one tiger. That is, the tiger can not move on its turn. 
The tiger wins if it captures three leopards, as there are not enough of them to immobilize the tiger.
Equipment.
The board used is a triangle dissected by two lines across its breadth, and one line across its length through its central axis. This makes for 10 intersection points. There are six white pieces representing the leopards, and one black piece representing the tiger. The leopard pieces and tiger piece are played on the intersection points. 
Game Play and Rules.
1. Players decide what animal to play. Players alternate their turns throughout the game. The board is empty in the beginning with the exception to the tiger piece which is placed on the top vertex of the triangle (the top vertex is the corner of the triangle where the vertical line running down the length of the triangle dissects it). 
2. The Leopards start first. All six leopard pieces must be dropped first before any of them can be moved. Only one leopard piece can be dropped per turn, and they are dropped onto any vacant point on the board during the Leopard's turn. 
3. The Tiger on its turn may either move the tiger one space onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board, or use it to capture a leopard piece. 
After all the leopards have been dropped, a leopard can move one space per turn onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board. Only one leopard may be moved per turn. Unlike the tiger, leopards can not capture. 
4. The tiger captures a leopard by the short leap as in draughts. The tiger must be adjacent to the leopard, and leap over it onto a vacant point on the other side following the pattern on the board. Only one capture is allowed per turn. Captures are not compulsory.

Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer

Friedrich Philipp Immanuel Niethammer (March 6, 1766 – April 1, 1848) was a German theologian, religious philosopher and Lutheran educational reformer who was a native of Württemberg.
He received instruction at the Maulbronn monastery, and in 1784 became a student at Tübinger Stift, where he met Friedrich Hölderlin (1770–1843), Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854). In 1790 he moved to Jena, where he studied Kantian philosophy under Karl Leonhard Reinhold (1757–1823). Subsequently, he became an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Jena, where he remained until 1804. In 1806 he was Protestant "Oberschulkommissar" (Upper school administrator) of Franconia, and during the following year, became Central Commissioner of Education and member of the Protestant "General Consistory" of Bavaria.
In 1797 with Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814), Niethammer was co-editor of the "Philosophische Journal". In 1798 the journal published Friedrich Karl Forberg's "Entwicklung des Begriffs der Religion" (Development of the Concept of Religion), an essay that Fichte prefaced with "Über den Grund unsers Glaubens an eine göttliche Weltregierung" (Grounds of our belief in a divine government of the universe). Reaction to the article included accusations of atheism, sparking the so-called 1798–99 "Atheismusstreit" (Atheism Dispute), an event that eventually led to Fichte's 1799 departure from Jena.
In 1808 Niethammer published "Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit" (The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time), a book that was a reaction to philanthropinism, an educational concept that was developed during the Age of Enlightenment. Philanthropinism valued practical and physical education, and largely rejected rote-learning of the classics. Niethammer agreed with the philanthropinists in that a measure of autonomy was important in education, but found their teaching philosophy too extreme. He believed that a sense of civics and civility were vital in a childs' education, and made efforts to combine the best of philanthropinism with the best of "humanism", a word that he derived from Cicero's "humanitas".

Mid-Hoosier Conference

History.
The conference was formed in 1965 by seven schools from Bartholomew (Hauser), Brown (Brown County), Johnson (Whiteland, Edinburgh), and Shelby (Southwestern, Triton Central, Waldron) counties as a conference for smaller schools south of Indianapolis. The conference had some roster changes in its early years, as Whiteland outgrew the MHC and moved to the Mid-State, while Indian Creek and South Decatur joined as newly consolidated schools. Triton Central left in 1969, and was replaced by Crothersville. This eight-member version of the MHC would last for a decade. The league would once again go through changes in the 1980s, as North Decatur (1980) and Morristown (1985) would join, and Crothersville would leave to become a full-time member of the Southern Athletic Conference, having been a member of both the MHC and the SAC since the latter's inception in 1974.
The league would stay stable until the late 1990s, as Triton Central rejoined from the Rangeline Conference, bringing membership to 10. This would be short-lived, however, as Brown County would join the reformed Western Indiana Conference in 1999. Triton Central would join the Indiana Crossroads Conference in 2012. The MHC would respond by bringing in two former White River Conference schools, Eastern Hancock and Knightstown. Both schools were scheduled to join in 2013, but Eastern Hancock was able to arrange its scheduling to join in 2012.
All of the football-playing schools of the MHC participate in the Mid-Indiana Football Conference.

The local fauna includes a long list of avian species such as toucans ("Ramphastos sulfuratus"), owls ("Pulsatrix perspicillata") humming birds ("Hylocharys elicieae", "Phaetornis superciliosus"), manakins ("Chiroxiphia lanceolata") pelicans and a plethora of other marine birds. Many mammals, unique to Central America inhabit the island such as howler monkeys ("Allouatta palliata", and the endemic Coiba species "Alouatta coibensis"), capuchin monkeys ("Cebus capucinus") coatis ("Nasua narica"), raccoons ("Procyon cancrivorus"), pacas ("Agouti paca"), agoutis or nueques ("Dasyprocta sp"), tayras ("Eira barbara"), bats ("Glossophaga soricina" &"Carollia castanea") sloths ("Bradypus variegatus") margays ("Leopardus wiedii") and white-tailed deer ("Odocoileus virginianus"). Besides the thousands of species of plants and insects endemic to this region of the tropical Americas, many reptile and amphibian species are also found on the island. Even occasionally the rare jungle cat ("Leopardus pardalis") is spotted in the dense jungle surrounding nearby Bahia Honda and Pixvae. In 2004 botanists, herpetologists, entomologists, ornithologists, and biologists convened to create the first comprehensive catalog of tropical plants, reptiles, insect, birds, and mammal diversity of this Pacific Coastal region.
Regional Geography and Geology.
Geography of Panama
The Gulf of Chiriquí contains several prominent, offshore island complexes including Isla Coiba (493 km2), Isla Cebaco (80 km2) Islas Ladrones, Islas Secas, and Islas Contreras. Other islands like Jicarón, Leones, Gobernadora, Verde, Canales de Afuera, Ranchería, Papagayo, Canales de Tierra, and Jicarita are part of a group of more than forty smaller island clusters scattered near the coast. Coastal areas in the gulf are a mélange of mid to late Tertiary volcanics, and much newer Quaternary period alluvial sedimentary series. Smaller island clusters are predominantly basalt outcrops once associated with the mainland before sea level rise. Coiba Island, the largest in the region, shares geomorphologies similar to the mainland Azuero peninsula.
Climate and Oceanographic conditions of Pacific Panama..
The climate of Panamá is largely affected by the position of a low atmospheric pressure zone known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which also affects seasonal evolution of geostrophic currents in the Panamá Bight. During the rainy season (December through May), the ITCZ is located to the North of Panamá and produces light and variable winds and ocean circulation in the Panamá Bight is anticyclonic (west) which creates a southerly flowing coastal current. As a result of these punctuated seasonal movements of the ITCZ, Panamá experiences high seasonal rainfall often reaching more than 3000 mm/yr. Starting in October and continuing into the dry season (January to March) the ITCZ moves South of Panamá, producing a dominant period of northeasterly tradewinds known as the Panamá Jet, which results in a reversal of water circulation and becomes a cyclonic gyre with a coastal current flowing to the north. Upwelling develops in the Gulf of Panama during the dry season when northeast tradewinds from the Caribbean blow over to the Pacific through a physiographic gap in the central mountain range which divides the Isthmus. This wind stress creates seasonal Ekman spiral pumping and displaces nutrient-poor coastal surface water with cool, nutrient rich, water masses.
Panama Liquid Jungle Underwater Tropical Observatory PLUTO.
In order to understand oceanic and atmospheric coupling, and the potential effects of these phenomena on ocean life, scientists must collect time series data which measure weather patterns, ocean circulation and sea water chemistry. PLUTO is a fiber-optic cabled observatory deployed in January 2006 in approximately 18 m of water 1.5 km to the south west of Isla de Canales de Tierra. The observatory consists of sensors for salinity, temperature, pressure, water current speed and direction, chlorophyll, turbidity, oxygen, down-welling light at two depths, an array of temperature sensors. A remotely controlled, high definition pan and tilt underwater camera displays rapid image updates of the benthic habitat surrounding the PLUTO sensors. The data are distributed via satellite back to WHOI and made available on the web (http://4dgeo.whoi.edu/panama/).
Coral Reefs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP).
Coral reefs usually exist in the euphotic zone (shallow areas of the sea where light can penetrate) along coastal or island areas, and require clear, oligotrophic (low nutrient) water in a narrow temperature and salinity range. Littoral areas located along the Southern Isthmus of Panamá demonstrate highly complex ecological interactions and distributions of endemic and migratory marine species due in part to the overlap of continental ecotones, tropical weather patterns and the convergence of powerful sea currents. In the Republic of Panamá, there is estimated 290 km2 of reefs along both Caribbean and Pacific coasts, however much higher diversity (about 68 hard coral species) occurs in the Caribbean, compared to 33 known species from 11 genera living along the Pacific coast. 
The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is a biotope known for intrinsically low coral species diversity which unfortunately enhances the potential threats to these coral reef systems. Besides the direct effects of overfishing, anchor damage, and coral mining, terrestrial land use affects coral reef habitats in more indirect ways. Panamá experiences high seasonal rainfall (3000 mm/yr.) and reefs can be severely impacted if corals are chronically exposed to the runoff of nutrients originating from deforestation and soil erosion, fertilizers, pesticides or untreated sewage. In addition to being a primary area for cattle ranching and agriculture, unregulated construction, septic waste increase and local coastal population expansion poses a tangible threat to the biological integrity of coral reefs surrounding the Coiba Island Marine Protected Area (MPA). Mangrove areas of Bahia Honda, Pixvae, and Puerto Mutis are important for the health of the local reefs, because mangroves not only filter the nutrients emptying onto reefs, but are important nurseries for juvenile fish, epibionts, crustaceans (i.e. shrimp), and other invertebrates that serve as critical food sources and spawning grounds for the offshore marine systems (i.e. Coiba and Cebaco islands). Scientists from around the world use the Liquid Jungle Lab facilities to study these reef systems in greater detail in order to establish ecologic baselines and understand natural and human impacts to the fish and marine life that rely on these habitats.

Smisje Brewery

The Smisje Brewery ("Brouwerij Smisje" in Dutch), with a tiny production of only 200 hectoliters per year, is one of the smallest existing Belgian craft breweries. Begun in 1995 by former printer and homebrewer Johan Brandt, it was originally titled "De Regenboog" (The Rainbow), the same name as his earlier printing business. Brandt is also a bee-keeper, which accounts for the prominent use of honey in some of the brewery's offerings, including its first commercial beer, which was named " 't Smisje" or "the little blacksmith" to reflect the hand-crafted nature of the product as well as a local landmark blacksmith's house near the brewery's original location.
From 1995-2008, the brewery was located in the West Flanders municipality of Assebroek, a suburb of Bruges. In 2008 it relocated to the village of Mater in Oudenaarde, East Flanders and changed its name to simply "Smisje".
Smisje is known for beers in both traditional Belgian styles and others, but particularly for brewing with distinctive ingredients and flavorings, often fruits or herbs. This experimental brewery exports roughly half of its annual product outside of Belgium to countries such as the United States, The Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Denmark. Despite its minuscule size, for many years Smisje has kept six beers in regular production in addition to a large variety of seasonal and occasional brews. Many of their beers have featured label art by Brooklyn cartoonist and craft beer enthusiast Bill Coleman.
In 2010, the brewery announced that it would be discontinuing all of its historic products in order to focus on a new blond, hoppy ale to be called "Smiske". Only the annual "Smisje Christmas" would be preserved. Following the example of Duvel Moortgat, who offered to brew again their limited-edition "Duvel Triple Hop" if 10,000 people would sign a petition for it, Brandt announced that if 20,000 people would join a Facebook group supporting it, he would offer to brew one additional historic recipe per year.
Technical.
Brandt began brewing in 1995 with a jury-rigged system capable of producing only 250 liters per batch, and slowly expanded the equipment over time in the original Bruges location. The new premises in Mater utilize the second-hand equipment of the now-defunct "De Teut" brewery of Neerpelt. The brewer maintains his own distinctive house yeast strain and utilizes primarily native Belgian hops. In addition to various spices and non-traditional ingredients such as sloe berries, Smisje is known to utilize the traditional Belgian method of using a significant amount of candi sugar in their recipes to lighten the body of stronger brews.

Lock Haven Formation

The Lock Haven Formation is a Devonian mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, in the Appalachian Mountains of the United States.
Description.
The Lock Haven is gray to green-brown sandstone, siltstone, and shale and is over 400 million years old. It is located in northcentral Pennsylvania.
Stratigraphy.
The Lock Haven may underlie various members of the Catskill Formation, although it may be a lateral equivalent of the Sherman Creek or Irish Valley Members of the Catskill. It is also a lateral equivalent of the Foreknobs Formation and underlying Scherr Formation. The Brallier Formation usually underlies the Lock Haven.
The Minnehaha Springs Member (originally proposed as a member of the Scherr Formation) is a "clastic bundle" consisting of interbedded medium gray siltstone and olive gray shale with some grayish-red siltstone and shale and some sandstone. It is interpreted as turbidites. This member is proposed to define the base of the Lock Haven Formation.

Lynndyl Subdivision

The Lynndyl Subdivision is a rail line owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad in the U.S. state of Utah, running from Salt Lake City southwest to Milford, where the Caliente Subdivision continues towards Los Angeles. It was formerly part of the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad.
History.
Mormon businessmen incorporated the Utah Southern Railroad in 1871 to build a standard gauge line from Salt Lake City south to Payson. It was built by the construction company Grover, McCune & Read, a firm owned by Alfred W. McCune and two other Utah businessmen. It was completed to that city and beyond to York (south of Santaquin) in 1875, and bought by the Union Pacific Railroad later that year. The UP organized the Utah Southern Railroad Extension in 1879, and completed the line to Frisco in 1880. Both companies merged with the Utah Central Railroad (Salt Lake City-Ogden) to form the UP-controlled Utah Central Railway in 1881, and in 1889 it was merged with the Utah and Northern Railway and other companies to form the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway, which was reorganized as the Oregon Short Line Railroad in 1897.
The Salt Lake, Sevier Valley and Pioche Railroad was incorporated in 1872 to build west from Salt Lake City, and the Utah Western Railway, organized in 1874, acquired its unfinished roadbed and completed the Three foot gauge railways narrow gauge line to a point near Stockton in 1877. The company was reorganized in 1881 as the Utah and Nevada Railway, and the UP gained control later that year, merging it into the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway in 1889. The Oregon Short Line later widened the gauge and extended the line south to the old Utah Southern at Lynndyl, west of Leamington. This new Leamington Cut-off, completed in 1903, had better grades and alignment than the old route through Payson, which became a secondary route (and is now, where still in use, the Sharp Subdivision). The San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, half-owned by the OSL, bought the OSL's lines south and west of Salt Lake City later that year, and completed the line to Los Angeles in 1905. The short piece of the old line from Milford, where the new Los Angeles line left, west to Frisco became the Frisco Branch, and was abandoned in 1943. After the UP bought the Western Pacific Railroad in 1983, the two parallel lines between Salt Lake City and Garfield, where the ex-WP Shafter Subdivision now begins, were converted to a directional running setup.

<doc id="18821046" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18821046" title="Chickenpox">
Chickenpox

Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). It usually starts with vesicular skin rash mainly on the body and head rather than at the periphery and becomes itchy, raw pockmarks, which mostly heal without scarring. On examination, the observer typically finds skin lesions at various stages of healing and also ulcers in the oral cavity and tonsil areas. Children are most commoly found with this disease.
Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily through coughing or sneezing by ill individuals or through direct contact with secretions from the rash. A person with chickenpox is infectious one to two days before the rash appears. They remain contagious until all lesions have crusted over (this takes approximately six days). Immunocompromised patients are contagious during the entire period as new lesions keep appearing. Crusted lesions are not contagious.
Chickenpox has been observed in other primates, including chimpanzees and gorillas.
The origin of the term "chicken pox", which is recorded as being used since 1684, is not reliably known. It has been said to be a derived from "chickpeas", based on resemblance of the vesicles to chickpeas, or to come from the rash resembling chicken pecks. Other suggestions include the designation "chicken" for a child (i.e., literally 'child pox'), a corruption of "itching-pox", or the idea that the disease may have originated in chickens. Samuel Johnson explained the designation as "from its being of no very great danger."
Signs and symptoms.
The early (prodromal) symptoms in adolescents and adults are nausea, loss of appetite, aching muscles, and headache. This is followed by the characteristic rash and/or oral sores, malaise, and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease. Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (exanthem). In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms, and the first sign is the rash or the spots in the oral cavity. The rash begins as small red dots on the face, scalp, torso and upper arms and legs; progressing over 10–12 hours to small bumps, blisters and pustules; followed by umbilication and the formation of scabs.
At the blister stage, intense itching is usually present. Blisters may also occur on the palms, soles, and genital area. Commonly, visible evidence of the disease develops in the oral cavity & tonsil areas in the form of small ulcers which can be painful or itchy or both; this enanthem (internal rash) can precede the exanthem (external rash) by 1 to 3 days or can be concurrent. These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. Adults may have a more widespread rash and longer fever, and they are more likely to experience complications, such as varicella pneumonia.
Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days prior to recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus also ceases.
Chickenpox is rarely fatal, although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications. Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with chickenpox in the previous year accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the "varicella zoster" virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection.
Diagnosis.
The diagnosis of varicella is primarily clinical, with typical early "prodromal" symptoms, and then the characteristic rash and oral-cavity sores. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be sought through either examination of the fluid within the vesicles of the rash, or by testing blood for evidence of an acute immunologic response.
Vesicular fluid can be examined with a Tzanck smear, or better by testing for direct fluorescent antibody. The fluid can also be "cultured", whereby attempts are made to grow the virus from a fluid sample. Blood tests can be used to identify a response to acute infection (IgM) or previous infection and subsequent immunity (IgG).
Prenatal diagnosis of fetal varicella infection can be performed using ultrasound, though a delay of 5 weeks following primary maternal infection is advised. A PCR (DNA) test of the mother's amniotic fluid can also be performed, though the risk of spontaneous abortion due to the amniocentesis procedure is higher than the risk of the baby developing fetal varicella syndrome.
Pathophysiology.
Exposure to VZV in a healthy child initiates the production of host immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. Cell-mediated immune responses are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary varicella infection. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of herpes zoster (i.e., "shingles"), postherpetic neuralgia, and sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II.
Pregnancy and neonates.
During pregnancy the dangers to the fetus associated with a primary VZV infection are greater in the first six months. In the third trimester, the mother is more likely to suffer from the adverse effects of the infection.
For pregnant women, antibodies produced as a result of immunization or previous infection are transferred via the placenta to the fetus. Women who are immune to chickenpox cannot become infected and do not need to be concerned about it for themselves or their infant during pregnancy.
Varicella infection in pregnant women could lead to viral transmission via the placenta and infection of the fetus. If infection occurs during the first 28 weeks of gestation, this can lead to fetal varicella syndrome (also known as "congenital varicella syndrome"). Effects on the fetus can range in severity from underdeveloped toes and fingers to severe anal and bladder malformation. Possible problems include:
Infection late in gestation or immediately following birth is referred to as ""neonatal varicella"". Maternal infection is associated with premature delivery. The risk of the baby developing the disease is greatest following exposure to infection in the period 7 days prior to delivery and up to 7 days following the birth. The baby may also be exposed to the virus via infectious siblings or other contacts, but this is of less concern if the mother is immune. Newborns who develop symptoms are at a high risk of pneumonia and other serious complications of the disease.
Shingles.
After a chickenpox infection, the virus remains dormant in the body's nerve tissues. The immune system keeps the virus at bay, but later in life, usually as an adult, it can be reactivated and cause a different form of the viral infection called shingles (scientifically known as herpes zoster).
The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) suggests that any adult over the age of 60 years gets the herpes zoster vaccine as a part of their normal medical check ups.
Many adults who have had chickenpox as children are susceptible to shingles as adults, often with the accompanying condition postherpetic neuralgia, a painful condition that makes it difficult to sleep. Even after the shingles rash has gone away, there can be night pain in the area affected by the rash.
Shingles affects one in five adults infected with chickenpox as children, especially those who are immune suppressed, particularly from cancer, HIV, or other conditions. However, stress can bring on shingles as well, although scientists are still researching the connection.
Shingles are most commonly found in adults over the age of 60 who were diagnosed with chickenpox when they were under the age of 1.
A shingles vaccine is available for adults over 50 who have had childhood chickenpox or who have previously had shingles.
Prevention.
Hygiene measures.
The spread of chickenpox can be prevented by isolating affected individuals. Contagion is by exposure to respiratory droplets, or direct contact with lesions, within a period lasting from three days prior to the onset of the rash, to four days after the onset of the rash. The chickenpox virus is susceptible to disinfectants, notably chlorine bleach (i.e., sodium hypochlorite). Also, like all enveloped viruses, it is sensitive to desiccation, heat and detergents.
Vaccine.
A varicella vaccine was first developed by Michiaki Takahashi in 1974 derived from the Oka strain. It has been available in the US since 1995 to inoculate against the disease. Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. Protection from one dose is not lifelong and a second dose is necessary five years after the initial immunization, which is currently part of the routine immunization schedule in the US. The chickenpox vaccine is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule in the UK. In the UK, the vaccine is currently only offered to people who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if infected.
Treatment.
Treatment mainly consists of easing the symptoms as there is no actual cure of the condition. Some treatments are however available for relieving the symptoms while the immune system suppresses the virus in the body. As a protective measure, patients are usually required to stay at home while they are infectious to avoid spreading the disease to others. Also, sufferers are frequently asked to cut their nails short or to wear gloves to prevent scratching and to minimize the risk of secondary infections.
The condition resolves by itself within a couple of weeks but meanwhile patients must pay attention to their personal hygiene. The rash caused by varicella zoster virus may however last for up to one month, although the infectious stage does not take longer than a week or two.
Although there have been no formal clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of topical application of calamine lotion, a topical barrier preparation containing zinc oxide and one of the most commonly used interventions, it has an excellent safety profile. It is important to maintain good hygiene and daily cleaning of skin with warm water to avoid secondary bacterial infection. Scratching may also increase the risk of secondary infection.
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) but not aspirin may be used to reduce fever. Aspirin use by someone with chickenpox may cause the serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, Reye syndrome. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to varicella zoster virus, to ward off the disease.
Antivirals are sometimes used.
Children.
If oral acyclovir is started within 24 hours of rash onset it decreases symptoms by one day but has no effect on complication rates. Use of acyclovir therefore is not currently recommended for immunocompetent individuals (i.e., otherwise healthy persons without known immunodeficiency or on immunosuppressive medication). Children younger than 12 years old and older than one month are not meant to receive antiviral medication unless they are suffering from another medical condition which would put them at risk of developing complications.
Treatment of chickenpox in children is aimed at symptoms while the immune system deals with the virus. With children younger than 12 years cutting nails and keeping them clean is an important part of treatment as they are more likely to scratch their blisters more deeply than adults.
Aspirin is highly contraindicated in children younger than 16 years as it has been related with a potentially fatal condition known as Reye's syndrome.
Some parents believe that it is better for children to contract chickenpox than to get the vaccine, and they deliberately expose their children to the virus, sometimes by taking them to "chickenpox parties." Some doctors counter that children are safer getting the vaccine, which is a weakened form of the virus, than getting the disease, which can be fatal.
Adults.
Infection in otherwise healthy adults tends to be more severe. Treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g. acyclovir or valacyclovir) is generally advised, as long as it is started within 24–48 hours from rash onset. Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used on children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. Antiviral medicines do not kill the virus, but stop it from multiplying. Adults are also advised to increase water intake to reduce dehydration and to relieve headaches. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are also recommended as they are effective in relieving itching and other symptoms such as fever or pains. Antihistamines relieve itches and may be used in cases where the itches prevents sleep, because they are also sedative. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. These include pregnant women or people who have a weakened immune system.
Sorivudine, a nucleoside analogue has been reported to be effective in the treatment of primary varicella in healthy adults (case reports only), but large-scale clinical trials are still needed to demonstrate its efficacy.
After recovering from chickenpox, it is recommended by doctors that adults take one injection of VZV immune globulin and one injection of varicella vaccine or herpes zoster vaccine.
Prognosis.
The duration of the visible blistering caused by varicella zoster virus varies in children usually from 4 to 7 days, and the appearance of new blisters begins to subside after the 5th day. Chickenpox infection is milder in young children, and symptomatic treatment, with sodium bicarbonate baths or antihistamine medication may ease itching, it is recommended to keep new infants from birth till 6 months of age away from an infected person for 10 to 21 days as their immune systems are not developed enough to handle the stress it can bring on. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used to reduce fever. Aspirin, or products containing aspirin, should not be given to children with chickenpox as it can cause Reye's Syndrome.
In adults, the disease is more severe, though the incidence is much less common. Infection in adults is associated with greater morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), hepatitis, and encephalitis. In particular, up to 10% of pregnant women with chickenpox develop pneumonia, the severity of which increases with onset later in gestation. In England and Wales, 75% of deaths due to chickenpox are in adults. Inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis, can occur in immunocompromised individuals, although the risk is higher with herpes zoster. Necrotizing fasciitis is also a rare complication.
Varicella can be lethal to adults with impaired immunity. The number of people in this high-risk group has increased, due to the HIV epidemic and the increased use of immunosuppressive therapies. Varicella is a particular problem in hospitals, when there are patients with immune systems weakened by drugs (e.g., high-dose steroids) or HIV.
Secondary bacterial infection of skin lesions, manifesting as impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas, is the most common complication in healthy children. Disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of varicella pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox also include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis.
Hemorrhagic complications are more common in the immunocompromised or immunosuppressed populations, although healthy children and adults have been affected. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The etiology of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known.
Epidemiology.
Primary varicella occurs in all countries worldwide. Varicella has a prevalence that is stable from generation to generation. As of 2010 it caused about 6,800 deaths, down from 11,200 in 1990.
In temperate countries, chickenpox is primarily a disease of children, with most cases occurring during the winter and spring, most likely due to school contact. It is one of the classic diseases of childhood, with the highest prevalence in the 4–10 year old age group. Like rubella, it is uncommon in preschool children. Varicella is highly communicable, with an infection rate of 90% in close contacts. In temperate countries, most people become infected before adulthood, and 10% of young adults remain susceptible.
In the tropics, chickenpox often occurs in older people and may cause more serious disease. In adults the pock marks are darker and the scars more prominent than in children.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require state health departments to report infections of chicken pox, and only 31 states currently volunteer this information. However, in a 2013 study conducted by the social media disease surveillance tool called Sickweather, anecdotal reports of chickenpox infections on Facebook and Twitter were used to measure and rank states with the most infections per capita, with Maryland, Tennessee and Illinois in the top 3.

Wallace Community College

Wallace Community College (WCC), formally known as George C. Wallace State Community College, is a two-year institution of higher learning located in Dothan, Alabama. The college enrolls 3,958 students and has been accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools since 1969. , the college has three campuses: the Wallace Campus in Dothan, the Sparks Campus in Eufaula, and the Fort Rucker Center.
History.
In 1997, the Alabama Aviation and Technical College became part of WCC. However, in 2003, the Alabama Aviation and Technical College operations and the Mobile Aviation Center were transferred to Enterprise State Junior College to reflect that institution's growth as a community college. Sparks State Technical College had been founded in 1966 as Sparks State Technical School, being named after former Alabama Governor Chauncey Sparks; following a rename as Sparks State Technical Institute in 1968, it was accredited by the Council on Occupational Education until merging in 1999 with WCC. WCC is also associated with two foundations that provide financial support for its operations: the Wallace Community College Foundation, founded in 1992, and the Wallace Community College Sparks Campus Foundation, founded in 1991.
In his later years, former Attorney General Richmond Flowers, Sr., taught history at Wallace Community College. His attorney general service occurred during the first term of Governor George Wallace, but the two were intraparty political rivals. In 1966, Flowers lost the gubernatorial primary to Wallace's first wife and successor, Lurleen Burns Wallace, for whom the community college in Andalusia is named.
Athletics.
WCC maintains a men's junior college baseball team affiliated with the Southern Conference and women's softball team.
Even though known as a men's junior college baseball school, back in 2001, the Wallace Community College Men's Basketball team won the AJCCC State Championship under coach Eddie Barnes and Assistant Coaches Philip M. Cassis and Tom Helmeyer. The team also made it to the NJCAA final four and finished third in the Nation. The baseball team is currently coached by former Major League Baseball catcher Mackey Sasser.

James Hawkins (United States Army officer)

James Hawkins, from Maysville, Kentucky, was a Battlefield commissioned Second lieutenant and field operations leader of the United States Army Tiger Force commando unit, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade (Separate), 101st Airborne Division, during the Vietnam War. The unit was featured in the Pulitzer Prize winning book "," written by "Toledo Blade" reporters Michael D. Sallah and Mitch Weiss (the Pulitzer Prize included a third "Blade" reporter Joe Mahr). The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command investigated the Tiger Force for "atrocities," including torture, maiming, rape, and murder of unarmed villagers, including babies, children, and the elderly, during operations in the Song Ve Valley. The Army did not file charges against Tiger Force soldiers, including their acting platoon leader, Hawkins. The investigations into the atrocities committed by Tiger Force occurred after reports and investigations into atrocities by United States Army soldiers in the My Lai Massacre. Hawkins attributes the lack of charges to the timing of the investigation after My Lai and the potential for additional bad "publicity."

Tom Long (hangman)

Tom Long (died 15 December 1908) was the New Zealand government hangman in the late 19th-early 20th century, although it was not a full time position. He executed the "baby farm" murderer Minnie Dean, the only woman hanged in New Zealand.
Long, an Irishman who claimed to have been an executioner in Australia, was appointed as New Zealand's first official hangman in 1877. In a newspaper interview in 1905 he claimed to have executed "fifteen in this country but hundreds in India.". He worked as a bushman and is said to have taken his swag through Wairarapa in between jobs. He was killed in 1908 while felling trees at Kauangaroa east of Wanganui.
