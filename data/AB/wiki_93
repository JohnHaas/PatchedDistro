Jean Lejeune

Jean Lejeune (born at Poligny in 1592; died at Limoges, 19 August 1672) was a French Oratorian priest, known as a preacher. Blindness overtook him at the age or thirty-five, and he was known as "The Blind Father". 
Life.
He was the son of a lawyer at Dole, of a family, which during the previous century had attained to a high position in the magistracy and was renowned for the piety and virtue of its members. Owing to the early loss of his father, his education devolved upon his mother who devoted herself to his spiritual advancement. 
Having studied theology at the University of Dole, he fell under the influence of Berulle and entered the Oratory in 1614, three years after its foundation. He was appointed director of the seminary at Langres but soon found his vocation in mission work among the poor.
His life was unmarked by any external event except the loss of sight which occurred in 1627, while he was preaching the Lenten course at Rouen, but this caused no cessation in his work. The bishops employed him in preaching the Lent and Advent courses and the Government in the conversion of Protestants. He avoided the custom of treating controversial matter in the pulpit and confined himself to the exposition of fundamental truths. It was a novel idea of his to introduce after his discourses an abridgement of Christian doctrine. He also held conferences for the instruction of the clergy in his methods and was recommended by Massillon to young ecclesiastics for their imitation. 
The French Oratory was suspected of Jansenism, and he was himself criticized on the ground that his preaching led to unsatisfactory results. In 1600 he appealed for advice to Antoine Arnauld, who ascribed these results to the laxity of confessors under the influence of casuistry, and dissuaded him from the design of abandoning his mission work. 
Works.
His sermons in twelve volumes were published at Toulouse, Paris, and Rouen before his death, and a Latin translation at Mainz in 1667. There is an edition published at Lyons in 1826, but the latest and best edition is that of Peltier in ten volumes issued in 1889. Four volumes of extracts also appeared at Avignon in 1825 under title of "Pensées du P. Lejeune".

Danan Hughes

Robert Danan Hughes (born December 11, 1970) is a former American football wide receiver that played in the National Football League.
College career.
Hughes spent his collegiate football career playing wide receiver for the University of Iowa from 1989 to 1992. After redshirting during the 1988 season, Hughes set a team record for freshman receiving yards with 471 yards on 28 receptions in 1989. That team record stood until the 2006 season when freshman Dominique Douglas passed Hughes to become Iowa’s all-time freshman receiving leader. Hughes ranks 3rd on Iowa’s all-time career receiving list, behind only Derrell Johnson-Koulianos with 168 receptions for 2544 career yards and Tim Dwight, with 146 receptions for 2,216 career yards. His 21 career touchdown receptions are tied with Dwight for second most in team history behind Marvin McNutt.
Hughes, along with quarterback Matt Rodgers and the running tandem of Nick Bell and Tony Stewart, helped lead the Hawkeyes back to the 1991 Rose Bowl where Iowa lost to Washington 46-34. The Hawkeyes have not been back to Pasadena since. Iowa also was invited to the 1991 Holiday Bowl the next season in Danan’s junior year and played BYU to a 13-13 tie. During the final regular season game of 1991, Hughes was on the receiving end of one of Matt Rodger’s 3 touchdown passes against Minnesota in the classic “Snow Game”. Danan celebrated by making a snow angel in the south end zone in Iowa's 23-8 victory which gave legendary coach Hayden Fry his 100th victory at Iowa. Hughes admitted in an interview on 1600 KGYM's "Balbinot and Brommelkamp" radio show in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sept. 27, 2011 the celebration was premeditated.
Danan Hughes also played outfield for the Hawkeye baseball team and was one of the best two-sport athletes in Iowa history. Hughes was drafted in the 3rd round of the 1992 amateur baseball draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. Only two Hawkeye baseball players have been drafted higher since 1992.
Professional career.
He decided to make football his full-time profession after college when the Kansas City Chiefs selected him in the 7th round of the 1993 NFL Draft. Hughes played for the Chiefs from 1993 to 1998 as a wide receiver and special teams player.
Broadcasting career.
Since 2008, Hughes has also served as a college football analyst for the Big Ten Network.

Juan Correa de Vivar

Juan Correa de Vivar (c.1510 - 16 April 1566) was a Spanish painter.
Life.
Correa was born in Mascaraque; his date of birth has been determined to be around 1510. Records show he grew up wealthy. When Juan was 17 or 18 years old he joined an artist workshop in Burgundy where he met with many other Spanish artists at the time, including Pedro de Cisneros whom he befriended.
Juan’s brother Eufrasia and Eufrasia’s son Rodrigo also grew up to be artists. Rodrigo was apprenticed with his uncle, and continued some of his uncle’s works after his death. In Mascaraque, Juan was a substantial landowner with a nice house where he did much of his painting. He took frequent trips but always stayed in the Toledo area.
Juan was married and a religious man. It can be seen in his testament: a copy was found in the church files of Mascaraque. When he died, Juan split all his possessions between his nephew Rodrigo and the church of Mascaraque.
Juan was a well-regarded painter during his life, but many records were lost. His works and life were brought to light again when the researcher and art historian Ceán Bermudez in 1800 published a dictionary of famous artists and included a brief article about his works and Italian influences. The full reconstruction of its biography has been primarily accomplished in the 20th century.
Records show Juan died on April 16, 1566 in San Miguel. Juan’s body was taken back to Mascaraque where he was buried, in the same plot where his parents were laid to rest. Many members of the artistic community came to the funeral service, including architects Alonso de Covarrubias and Nicolás de Vergara, the sculptor Francisco de Linares, and the painters Diego de Aguilar and Blas Pablín.
Works.
Juan was heavily influenced by Raphael. One of his most important works was the altarpiece of the church of Almonacid de Zorita, in province of Guadalajara. This work was done in collaboration with Alonso de Covarrubias. It was destroyed in World War II in 1936-39. 
From Raphael he took his colorful tone and delicate and smooth figures. Over the years his style evolved into more dynamic forms of Mannerism, especially with respect to the way to bring about violent movement in the figures. 
In the province of Toledo have been found some of Juan’s better known works. This includes the altarpiece of San Roque, in Almorox, and the altarpiece of the collegiate church of Torrijos, whose twelve tables were done with the help of students of their factory. The Museo del Prado of Madrid also includes many excellent examples of his work.
His first independent works began when he was twenty years old. Some of the work came to him through familiar contacts. For example Juan’s paintings for the greater altarpiece of Clarisas of Nectarine, between 1532 and 1534, were funded by his uncle Don Rodrigo de Vivar.
Included works in these early years are also the table of the Birth of the Santa María de Guadalupe monastery, and the altarpiece of identical subject that Juan did for Stewing and which today can be found in both the Museo del Prado and the Museum of Santa Cruz de Toledo. The influence of his teacher, very evident in these first works, became more diluted over the years. 
In the Forties some of his masterpieces can be found at the monastery of San Martin de Valdeiglesias today. There were also highly admired altarpieces that were taken to the Prado after the ecclesiastical confiscation of 1836 and museum distributed the national them by other pinacotecas like the one of Saragossa or Vigo, churches like San Jerónimo el Real of Madrid or in the deposit of the same Prado. 
Between 1550 and 1566, the year of his death, Juan’s style became more personal, taking on a mannerism style that make his figures more forceful and energetic, but without losing his traditional elegance.

Ava Alice Muriel Astor

Ava Alice Muriel Astor (July 7, 1902 – July 19, 1956) was an American heiress, socialite, and member of the Astor family. She was the daughter of John Jacob Astor IV and Ava Lowle Willing, and sister of Vincent Astor.
Early life.
Ava was born on July 7, 1902, the only daughter of John Jacob "Jack" Astor IV and Ava Lowle Willing. Her paternal grandparents were yachtsman William Backhouse Astor, Jr. and socialite Caroline Webster "Lina" Schermerhorn, while her maternal grandparents were Edward Shippen Willing and Alice Barton.
Marriages.
Ava Astor married Prince Sergei Platonovich "Serge" Obolensky, son of General Platon Sergeyevich Obolensky and Maria Konstantinovna Naryshkina, on July 24, 1924 in the Savoy Chapel in London. The marriage was considered the event of the season in England that year. Her brother Vincent gave her a Palladian Revival stone residence on his estate near Rhinebeck, New York. The house was north of his own "Ferncliff Casin" "("Astor Courts")" and also overlooked the Hudson River. Ava named it "Marienruh" and retained it through her life. They had a son Ivan (born May 15, 1925) and a daughter Sylvia (May 18, 1931 — June 27, 1997)
After divorcing Serge in 1932, she married Raimund von Hofmannsthal (1906 — March 20, 1974), son of Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Gertrud "Gerty" Schlesinger. The couple was married on January 21, 1933, in the city court of Newark, New Jersey. The couple had a daughter, Romana von Hofmannsthal (born c. 1935), who married Roderick McEwen. Raimund later married Lady Elizabeth Paget.
From 1936–1937, she had an affair with English choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton, despite the fact that he was gay. After the affair ended, her love for him continued, though she had two subsequent marriages, both to gay Englishmen.
After divorcing Raimund in 1939, she married Philip John Ryves Harding, a journalist. The wedding took place on March 27, 1940, in Faversham, England. Out of this union, one daughter, Emily Edwina Harding, was born in 1942.
Lastly, she married David Pleydell-Bouverie (born April 20, 1911, the grandson of William Pleydell-Bouverie, 5th Earl of Radnor) on May 12, 1946 in Reading, Vermont. The couple resided in New York City and Glen Ellen, California, before divorcing in 1952.
Death.
Ava Astor died of a stroke in her East Sixty-First Street apartment on July 19, 1956, aged 54. She was a patron of the arts, including the ballet companies of London and New York City.
Her will was admitted to probate on November 5, 1956, in Manhattan Surrogate Court. Her assets, totaling $5,305,000, (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars) were divided among her four children.

Marija Leiko

Marija Leiko (, also known as Marija Leyko; August 14, 1887, Riga, Latvia – February 3, 1938, Moscow, USSR) was a Latvian silent movie actress in Europe since the 1910s, especially popular in Latvia, Germany and Russia.
Life and film career.
As an actress Marija Leiko conquered the German big screen first starring in the "Die Diamantenstiftung" (1917), "Kain" (1918), "Ewiger Strom" (1919), "Die Frau im Käfig" (1919) and "Lola Montez" (1919) as the dancer.

In 1935 she visited the Soviet Union and stayed to join the company of the Latvian State Theatre in Moscow. This theatre was shut down during Stalin's purges and on December 15, 1937, Leiko was arrested on false charges of belonging to a "Latvian nationalist conspiracy". On February 3, 1938, she was shot and buried in a mass grave at the secret NKVD killing field at Butovo, near Moscow. She was "posthumously rehabilitated in absence of a crime" in 1958.

<doc id="18810047" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18810047" title="Performances of Carnatic music">
Performances of Carnatic music

Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, who sit on an elevated stage. This usually consists of at least; a principal performer, a melodic accompaniment, a rhythm accompaniment, and a drone. 
The "tambura" is the traditional drone instrument used in concerts, however, tamburas are increasingly being replaced by "śruti" boxes, and now more commonly, the "electronic "tambura"". The drone itself is an integral part of performances and furnishes stability - the equivalent of harmony in Western music.
Performance.
Performances can be musical or musical-dramatic. Musical recitals are either vocal, or purely instrumental in nature, while musical-dramatic recitals refer to Harikatha. But irrespective of what type of recital it is, what is featured are compositions which form the core of this genre of music. 
In a vocal recital, a concert team may have one or more vocalists, accompanied by instrumentalists as melodic and rhythmic accompaniments. Instruments, such as the veena and/or flute, can be occasionally found as a rhythmic accompaniment, but usually, a vocalist is supported by a violin player (who sits on his/her left). The rhythm accompanist is usually a mridangam player (who sits on the other side, facing the violin player). However, other percussion instruments such as the ghatam, "kanjira" and "morsing" frequently also accompany the main percussion instrument and play almost in a contrapuntal fashion along with the beats. The objective of the accompanying instruments is far more than following the melody and keeping the beats. The accompaniments form an integral part of every composition 
presented, and they closely follow and augment the melodic phrases outlines by the lead singer. The vocalist and the violinist take turns while elaborating or while exhibiting creativity in sections like raga, niraval and kalpanaswaram. Unlike Hindustani music concerts, where an accompanying tabla player can keep beats without following the musical phrases at times, in Carnatic music, the accompaniments have to know follow intricacies of the composition since there are percussion elements such as eduppu, in several compositions. Some of the best concerts 
feature a good bit of interaction with the lead musicians and the accompaniments exchanging notes, and accompanying musicians predicting the lead singer musical phrases.
Concert content.
A contemporary Carnatic concert (called a "kutcheri") usually lasts about three hours, and usually comprises a number of varied compositions. Carnatic songs are composed in a particular "raga", which means that they do not deviate from the notes in the "raga". Each composition is set with specific notes and beats, but performers improvise extensively. Improvisation occurs in the melody of the composition as well as in using the notes to expound the beauty of the "raga".
Concerts usually begin with a "varnam" or an invocatory item which will act as the opening piece. The "varnam" is composed with an emphasis on "swaras" of the raga, but will also have lyrics, the "saahityam". It is lively and fast to get the audience's attention. An invocatory item, may alternatively, follow the "varnam". 
After the "varnam" and/or invocatory item, the artist sings longer compositions called "kirtanas" (commonly referred to as "kriti"s). Each kriti sticks to one specific "raga", although some are composed with more than one raga; these are known as "ragamalika" (a garland of "ragas").
After singing the opening "kriti", usually, the performer sings the "kalpanaswaram" of the "raga" to the beat. The performer must improvise a string of "swaras" in any octave according to the rules of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the "swaras" with a phrase selected from the "kriti". The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of "swara", the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the "raga", have no awkward pauses and lapses in the beat of the song, and create a complex pattern of notes that an experienced audience can follow. 
Performers then begin the main compositions with a section called "raga alapana" exploring the "raga". In this, they use the sounds "aa, ri, na, ta", etc. instead of "swaras" to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the raga. This begins slowly and builds to a crescendo, and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the "raga" that shows the performer's skill. All of this is done without any rhythmic accompaniment, or beat. Then the melodic accompaniment (violin or veena), expounds the "raga". Experienced listeners can identify many ragas after they hear just a few notes. With the "raga" thus established, the song begins, usually with lyrics. In this, the accompaniment (usually violin, sometimes veena) performs along with the main performer and the percussion (such as a mridangam). In the next stage of the song, they may sing "niraval" or "kalpanaswaram" again. 
In most concerts, the main item will at least have a section at the end of the item, for the percussion to perform solo (called the "tani avartanam"). The percussion performers perform complex patterns of rhythm and display their skill. If multiple percussion instruments are employed, they engage in a rhythmic dialogue until the main performer picks up the melody once again. Some experienced artists may follow the main piece with a "ragam thanam pallavi" mid-concert, if they do not use it as the main item.
Following the main composition, the concert continues with shorter and lighter songs. Some of the types of songs performed towards the end of the concerts are "tillanas" and "thukkadas" - bits of popular "kriti"s or compositions requested by the audience. Every concert that is the last of the day ends with a "mangalam", a thankful prayer and conclusion to the musical event.
Audience.
The audience of a typical concert has a reasonable understanding of Carnatic music. It is also typical to see the audience tapping out the "tala" in sync with the artist's performance. As and when the artist exhibits creativity, the audience acknowledge it by clapping their hands. With experienced artists, towards the middle of the concert, requests start flowing in. The artist usually plays the request and it helps in exhibiting the artist's broad knowledge of the several thousand kritis that are in existence.
Modern concerts.
Every December, the city of Chennai in India has its six week-long Music Season, which has been described as the world's largest cultural event. The Music Season was started in 1927, to mark the opening of the Madras Music Academy. It used to be a traditional month-long Carnatic music festival, but since then it has also diversified into dance and drama, as well as non-Carnatic art forms.
The music season in Chennai is in the month of Margashira - Marghazhi in Tamil and comes to an end with the festival of Makara Shankrati or Pongal.
The cultural hub of Karnataka, Mysore - Bangalore region celebrates its Music Season known as Ramnavami Music Festival for a period of 45 days. Unlike the Madras Season which are held in closed auditoriums, the Ramanavami Music Festival is mostly held in Open Air Aoditoriums. The pleasant Chaitra - month of Kannada Calendar and evening showers make up the event much more celebrous. In Mysore, the concerts are held in Shri Bidaram Krishnappa Mandira and Jaganmohana Palace. Apart from these, many other smaller sabhas in Bangalore, Mysore, Hassan, Shimoga and Chikmagalur also conduct concerts in this festive season.

Charlton Athletic F.C. Academy

Charlton Athletic Football Club Youth Academy are the youth team of Charlton Athletic. Their Under-18 team play in the U18 Professional Development League 2 - South, however the academy takes boys from the ages of 9 upwards.
The U21 team also has strong connotations with the Charlton Reserves squad, where senior members of the team may make appearances. The academy is run by the club's Academy Director Paul Hart & Academy Manager Steve Avory.
History.
The Charlton Athletic Youth Academy was a development of Charlton's commitment to develop young players, a scheme which started in the early-mid-1990s when there was an explosion of young talent under joint managers Steve Gritt & . Notable players such as Scott Minto, Kim Grant, Anthony Barness, Lee Bowyer, Richard Rufus, Linvoy Primus, Shaun Newton, Jlloyd Samuel, Jamie Stuart, Kevin Lisbie, Paul Konchesky & Scott Parker all came through the ranks.
This was followed by the creation of the Youth Academy in 1998, aiming to find the best local, and worldwide talent to bring to Charlton at a young age. There are many players playing in the top 2 tiers of English football who began their footballing career at the Charlton Youth Academy, including Arsenal's Carl Jenkinson, Bournemouth's Harry Arter, Birmingham's Darren Randolph, Millwall's Josh Wright, Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey, Norwich's Michael Turner and Newcastle's Robert Elliot as well as current Charlton first team players Chris Solly, Harry Lennon, Morgan Fox, Jordan Cousins, Diego Poyet, Lawrie Wilson, Callum Harriott and Joe Pigott.
In June 2010 Steve Gritt's contract at the club was terminated due to financial restraints. The role of Academy manager was abolished following Gritt's redundancy, and control of the youth set up has been handed over to development coach Damien Matthew & assistant academy manager Steve Avory.
Since 1998 26 Players have made it through the Academy to taste first team Football with Charlton.

Valley Gold.
The Valley Gold scheme was previously set up to aid Charlton's return to The Valley. When a supporter signs up to the scheme, they now have the opportunity to win up to £15,000 at half-time on home match days, as well as getting £15 off the price of their season ticket and the opportunity to have first priority to away games or high demand home matches.
Since Charlton's return to the Valley in December 1992 the scheme has since used to give financial support to the Charlton Youth Academy, to help nurture Charlton stars of the future.

Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds

"Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds" is an 1823 painting by the nineteenth-century landscape painter John Constable (1776–1837). This image of Salisbury Cathedral, one of England's most famous medieval churches, is one of his most celebrated works, and was commissioned by one of his closest friends, John Fisher, The Bishop of Salisbury. 
Constable visited Salisbury in 1820 and made a series of oil sketches of the cathedral, which served as the model for this composition. The artist selected a viewpoint from the bishop's garden and included figures of Dr. Fisher and his wife at the bottom left. Following its exhibition at the 1823 Royal Academy, Constable observed: "My Cathedral looks very well...It was the most difficult subject in Landscape I ever had upon my Easel. I have not flinched at the work of the windows, buttresses, &c. - but I have as usual made my escape in the Evanescence of the Chiaro-Oscuro". His patron took exception to the dark cloud over the cathedral, and when he commissioned a smaller replica, requested "a more serene sky". 
The painting embodies the full range of qualities of a quintessentially British landscape painting – the clouds, trees, a water meadow, cattle drinking at the edge of the pasture and the glorious architecture of a medieval cathedral – but all on a human scale. Paintings like this one have so conditioned our view of rural Britain that it is now difficult to imagine a time when the countryside and country life were not held in such high regard.
A version of the painting also resides at the Frick Collection in New York City. It is slightly different in that it shows different weather and hence light. Whereas the London version depicts the cathedral with an overcast sky, the version in the Frick shows the cathedral with a clear, bright sky.
There is an earlier, homonymous version (1821-1822) of this painting at São Paulo Museum of Art in São Paulo. It is said that Fisher, seeing its sombre and grave colors, disliked it and asked for a happier, lighter one.

Bill Lee (yacht designer)

Bill Lee is the designer of many famous ocean racing yachts, and one of the founders of the Santa Cruz school of boatbuilding, known to many as "the Wizard". Several of his designs achieved notoriety in the 1970s, with "Chutzpah" and "Merlin" having won the Transpacific Yacht Race from Los Angeles to Honolulu many times. "Merlin" set and held the course record several times as well, shaving days off the prior fastest times.
Mr. Lee's designs are noted for having been narrower and much lighter, often half the weight of competitors at times. His designs helped define the class of boat known as a ULDB, or ultra light displacement boat, which tend to excel at surfing downwind with spinnakers in heavy breeze. These boats required fewer crew, made better use of scarce resources in their construction, and generally attracted highly skilled sailors with big-wave surfing backgrounds at breaks such as Steamer's Lane, Ghost Trees and Mavericks. Many folks had to get their hair cut before sailing on one of Lee's ULDBs since they went so fast their hair often got quite tussled. 
Mr Lee is also known for his boatyard on Hilltop Rd, Soquel, CA, known as "the Coop", as it was a chicken coop before Lee and his associates converted it into a boatyard.

<doc id="18810199" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18810199" title="Francis Small">
Francis Small

Francis Small (October 6, 1625 - ca. 1714) was an enterprising trader and landowner residing primarily in Kittery, Maine. He made the first recorded land purchase in what is now Maine, and proceeded to amass so much that he was called "the great landholder." He possessed the largest number of acres of anyone who ever lived in Maine.
Life and business.
Small was the only child of Edward Small and Elizabeth Shurtt of Bideford, Devonshire, England who is known to have remained in America. There is no record of the other five children ever coming to the American Colonies. Francis is believed to have arrived in New England with his father about 1632. In 1648, he was residing in Dover, New Hampshire, and married Elizabeth Leighton of Kittery about 1650. While living in Casco (now Portland) in 1657, he bought from Scitterygusset, a local sagamore, about 200 acres (80.94 hectares) located on the northern side of Capisic Brook. In 1659, Small established a trading camp on Sebascodegan Island, now part of Harpswell. By 1668, he resided in Kittery, with a trading post (as a squatter) near the confluence of the Ossipee River and Saco River at what is now Cornish. Here major Indian trails converged—the Sokokis Trail (now Route 5), the Ossipee Trail (now Route 25), and the Pequawket Trail (now Route 113) -- a location conducive towards lucrative fur trade with Indians, but also with risks of living isolated in the wilderness.
Plot on his life.
Indeed, Chief Wesumbe (or Captain Sandy), the sagamore of the Newichewannock Abenaki tribe, warned Small of a planned attempt on his life by renegade tribesmen. They were indebted to the trader, having purchased goods in the spring on credit, to be paid in the fall with furs. Instead, they decided to erase the debt by killing him at early dawn on a certain day, setting fire to his house and shooting him when he ran out the door. At first Small thought the warning a trick to frighten him away and avoid payment. Just to be on the safe side, however, he took refuge on a nearby hill, from which he could peer through the pines and observe what might transpire. Sure enough, at first light his trading post went up in flames, illuminating the dark forest. Small began running and didn't stop until he reached Kittery.
The Ossipee Tract.
As compensation for his losses, Chief Wesumbe sold to Small on November 28, 1668, twenty square miles of land, in all 256,000 acres (103,600 hectares), between the Ossipee River, Little Ossipee River, and Newichewannock River (now Salmon Falls River). The price was two large Indian blankets, two gallons of rum, two pounds of powder, four pounds of musket balls and twenty strings of Indian beads. The purchase comprised what is called the Ossipee Tract -- Limington, Limerick, Cornish (formerly named Francisborough after its early proprietor), Newfield, Parsonsfield and Shapleigh (part of which was later set off as Acton). Small thereupon sold a half interest in the Ossipee Tract to Major Nicholas Shapleigh, who lived at what is now Eliot, and was then the richest man in the Piscataqua River region. 
But Indian unrest flared in 1675-1676 with King Philip's War. English settlements up the coast were attacked and burned until the revolt was quashed. About 1684, Small operated a trading post on Cape Small (which takes its name from him) at the extremity of what is today Phippsburg. During King William's War, however, English settlements in the region were destroyed again in 1689 by Abenaki warriors allied with the forces of New France, which resented encroachment into territory it considered part of Acadia. The area was deserted. Small took part in the Ossipee Excursion in this war.
About 1700, Small moved from Kittery to Truro, Massachusetts to live with his son, Daniel. Major Nicholas Shapleigh died in 1682, followed 32 years later by Small. Then in 1770, the original unrecorded deed from Wesumbe to Francis Small was found by Small's heirs. Together with the heirs of Shapleigh, in 1772 they appointed a committee to recover the land. Accompanied by a surveyor and chairman, the committee marked what became the towns' boundaries. Represented by attorney James Sullivan, Small's heirs took possession of Cornish, Limington, Newfield and half of Limerick, while Shapleigh's heirs took possession of Parsonsfield, Shapleigh and the remainder of Limerick, the latter town presented by both sets of heirs to Sullivan as his fee.

Flood Control Act of 1917

The Flood Control Act of 1917 ("Ransdell-Humphreys Flood Control Act of 1917", Ch 144, , enacted March 1, 1917) is an Act of Congress enacted in response to costly floods in the lower Mississippi Valley, the Northeast, and the Ohio Valley between 1907 and 1913.
Legislative Provisions.
It was enacted to control floods on the Mississippi River, the Ohio River, and the Sacramento River, not to exceed in the aggregate $45,000,000, with not more than $10,000,000 during any one fiscal year.
All money appropriated under the act was expended under the direction of the Secretary of War in accordance with the plans, specifications, and recommendations of the Mississippi River Commission as approved by the Chief of Engineers. It included surveys and estimates to determine the cost of protecting the Mississippi River basin from floods. It also provided for the salaries, clerical, office, traveling, and miscellaneous expenses of the Mississippi River Commission.
Local interests protected thereby were to contribute not less than one-half of the cost of construction. At the completion of any levee building, the levees were to be locally maintained with the Federal Government retaining control. 
No money was to be expended for any right of way for any levee which may be constructed in cooperation with any State or levee district under authority of this Act, but all such rights of way shall be provided free of cost to the United States.
Other watercourses connected with the Mississippi River could, in the discretion of the commission, also be improved.
Upon the completion of any levee constructed for flood control under authority of this Act, said levee shall be turned over to the levee district protected thereby for maintenance thereafter; but for all other purposes the United States shall retain such control over the same as it may have the right to exercise upon such completion.
The act also required comprehensive studies of the watersheds as to the extent and character of the area to be affected by the proposed improvement, the probable effect upon any navigable water or waterway, possible economical development and utilization of water power, and other uses properly related to or coordinated with the project. All reports on preliminary examinations authorized, together with the report of the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors were to be submitted to the Secretary of War by the Chief of Engineers and transmitted to the House of Representatives.

Gideon Lincecum

Gideon Lincecum (22 April 1793 – 28 November 1874) was an American pioneer, historian, physician, philosopher, and naturalist. Lincecum is known for his exploration and settlement of what are now the U.S. states of Alabama, Mississippi and Texas, which was then beyond the western borders of the Thirteen Colonies. Lincecum had good relations with Native Americans as he explored the wilderness in the American Deep South. He was son of Hezekiah and Sally (Hickman) Lincecum, and was born in Warren County, Georgia, on April 22, 1793. Lincecum was self-educated. He spent his boyhood principally in the company of Muskogees. After successive moves, he and his wife, the former Sarah Bryan, moved in 1818 with his parents and siblings to the Tombigbee River above the site of present Columbus, Mississippi.
While living among the Choctaw in Mississippi, he recorded their legends and traditions in the Choctaw language. After moving to Texas, he translated it to English as the "Chahta Tradition".
He sought a new frontier in 1868 and, at the age of seventy-six, with a widowed daughter and her seven children, joined a Confederate colony in Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico. He died on November 28, 1874 after a long illness at his Long Point, Texas, home.
Historian.
Lincecum had contact with Chickasaw, Creek (Muscogee), and Choctaw Native Americans before the Indian Removals of the 1830s began. He learned how to speak and write their languages, learned about their medicine, and recorded their history. Lincecum frequently visited an elderly Choctaw man named "Chahta Immataha", who gave him a detailed account of Choctaw oral history. Historian Patricia Galloway notes that Lincecum's "narrative is not reliable."
Naturalist.
Lincecum was a self-taught naturalist. Lincecum would spend "countless hours observing birds, insects, weather, rocks, and plants. He regularly corresponded with like-minded individuals, including Charles Darwin on two occasions. He published numerous articles in scholarly scientific journals and came to be recognized as a thorough and respectable researcher, in spite of his lack of formal education."

Andrzej Saramonowicz

Andrzej Saramonowicz (born 23 February 1965 in Warsaw) is a Polish director, actor, journalist and scenarist. Saramonowicz studied history at Warsaw university before turning to journalism. He collaborated with some of the main polish mainstream magazines, such as "Gazeta Wyborcza", "Viva" and "Przekrój". In 2000, his first screenplay and movie "Pół serio" ("half seriously") won him the main award at the 2000 edition of the Festival of Polish Fiction Movies in Gdynia and kickstarted his career as a filmmaker. He then went on to write, produce and direct some of the biggest commercial successes of Polish cinema in the last decade. His comedies Testosteron, Lejdis and Idealny facet dla mojej dziewczyny alone totaled 4.6 million viewers, approximately a quarter of all tickets sold in that period.
Early works.
After the unexpected success of "Pół serio" (based on the eponymous cultural TV programme) Saramonowicz went on to write the now-cult theater play Testosteron, which would hit stages nation-wide and abroad (notably in the UK, Turkey, Czech Republic, Bulgaria...). In 2003 came out the black comedy Ciało, which he made in collaboration with Tomasz Konecki. Ciało, a critical and commercial success, was awarded the Złota Kaczka (Gold Duck) for best Polish movie at the Film Magazine award ceremony.
Mainstream success.
In 2007, the film adaptation of Saramonowicz's theater play Testosteron hit the big screens. With 1,4 million viewers, Testosteron was the first in a string of comedies that would renew the landscape of Polish humor - among which Lejdis (2007), Idealny facet dla mojej dziewczyny ("the perfect guy for my girlfriend") (2009) and Jak się pozbyć cellulitu ("how to get rid of cellulite") (2011). The latter is the first in a two-film deal with Warner Bros. Polska as a part of their local language production strategy.

Sonata for Clarinet (Cage)

Sonata for Clarinet is an early work by John Cage, composed in 1933. It is also known under its early title, Sonata for One Voice.
History.
The piece was created in 1933 (the first and last movements composed on September 3 and 5, respectively) while Cage was studying music with Richard Buhlig (Nicholls 2002, 63). Buhlig convinced Cage to send the Sonata, as well as some other pieces, to Henry Cowell for publication in "New Music"; thus it became Cage's earliest published piece. Cowell later suggested that the Sonata be performed at a New Music Society of California workshop in San Francisco. When Cage arrived, it turned out the clarinetist couldn't play the piece, and Cage had to play it himself, on piano (Nicholls 1990, 176). Cage also tried to get a Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra clarinetist to play the sonata, but the clarinetist refused on aesthetic grounds (Kostelanetz 2003, 103). Later in life, Cage made some revisions and the sonata was finally published by Edition Peters, Cage's principal publisher, in 1963. Although he disliked some of his early works, he considered the Sonata, according to a late interview, "very interesting" (Duckworth 1999, 8).
Analysis.
The Sonata is scored for a solo clarinet in B-flat. There are no dynamics, articulation or phrasing indications (Nicholls 1990, 176). Overall, the style is, in the words of Cage scholar James Pritchett, "chromatic, rhythmically complex, and unmetrical." (Pritchett 1993, 7). There are three movements:
The first movement is influenced by twelve-tone technique, but is not bound by its formal procedures: there is no row in the strict sense of the word, but the music is based on retrogrades of various melodic and rhythmic fragments. For example, the contents of bars 1–2 is presented in retrograde in bars 20–21, with the same rhythm, and similar symmetries and transformations inform the entire movement (Nicholls 2002, 64).
By contrast, the second movement uses the tone row technique in a much more strict manner, although still only marginally related to Schoenberg's method. It begins with the various forms of the row following one another in close succession: prime (bars 1–5), transposed (bars 5–9), retrograde (bars 10–12). Bars 12–19 are filled with fragments from each of the three used forms, and the movement ends with the retrograde inversion (bars 20–24). The last notes repeat (pitch-wise) the ones from bar 5, where the prime form overlapped with the transposed form (Nicholls 2002, 63–64).
The third movement is an exact pitch retrograde of the first.

USS Belle Isle (AG-73)

USS "Belle Isle" (AG-73/AKS-21) was a "Basilan"-class miscellaneous auxiliary acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. "Belle Isle" was configured as a repair ship and used in Pacific Ocean operations. At war’s end she was converted to a stores ship before being finally decommissioned.
Constructed in Maine.
"Belle Isle" (AG 73) was laid down on 19 September 1944 at South Portland, Maine, by the New England Shipbuilding Corporation under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 3070); launched on 3 November 1944; sponsored by Miss Sally Goding; transferred to the Navy on a loan basis on 15 November 1944; commissioned that same day for the voyage to the conversion yard, Lt. Comdr. James H. Graves, Jr., USNR, in command; decommissioned on 18 November 1944 at Hoboken, New Jersey, for conversion to an electronics repair ship by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation; and recommissioned on 13 July 1945.
World War II-related service.
"Belle Isle" was assigned to Service Division (ServDiv) 104, Service Squadron (ServRon) 10, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and, by 7 October, was at Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands making repairs for ships of the Pacific Fleet. 
She served at Okinawa until heading for Japan early in December. The ship arrived at Wakayama on 15 December and began repair duties for the occupation forces. That assignment lasted until she departed Japan on 31 March 1946 and headed back to the United States.
Post-war decommissioning.
After making port at San Francisco, California, the electronics repair ship shifted south to San Diego, California, to prepare for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 30 August 1946 and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.
Temporary reactivation.
On 18 August 1951, while still in reserve, "Belle Isle" was reclassified a stores issue ship and redesignated "AKS-211".
Final decommissioning.
She remained in reserve until 1960. On 1 April 1960, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. Her disposal was approved on 3 August 1960, and she was apparently sunk as a target later that year.
In November 1960, the ships in Destroyer Squadron 13 sank the Belle Isle off the coast of San Diego---I was on board one of them, the USS MORTON (DD948).

Villa San Michele Hotel

Villa San Michele Hotel is a hotel situated on the hill of Fiesole overlooking Florence, Italy. It is named after the church of St Michael the Archangel. Today it is owned by Orient-Express Hotels and operated as a luxury hotel.
History.
The original building was a monastery, founded in the early years of the 15th century for the Franciscan monks. The land on which it stood had been donated by a Florentine family, the Davanzatis, who also contributed to the monastery's upkeep by gifts of woodlands, further buildings and money. 
The present building, with its façade attributed to Michelangelo and its imposing loggia, dates from 1600 when it was enlarged and completely renovated by Giovanni di Bartolomeo Davanzati.
The monastery remained the property of the Franciscans until 1808 when the monastic orders were dissolved by Napoleon and, in 1817, it returned to secular use. By this time, many of its most treasured possessions had been dispersed throughout Florence's churches and art galleries. 
In 1900 the Villa was acquired by Henry White Cannon from New York, who landscaped the gardens, erected large greenhouses and restored the building after the fashion of the Victorians, by adding wrought iron gates and by applying a rust-coloured patina to the walls. He also converted the courtyard into a winter garden by covering it with a roof of glass and iron. 
During World War II, the Villa was badly damaged and, in 1950, it was bought by Monsieur Lucien Tessier as a private residence.
He set about restoring the 20 first floor rooms, while living on the second floor, but the cost involved was substantial and to finance it, he turned the villa in to a hotel for those wanting to visit the nearby art treasures of Florence and the surrounding countryside.
In 1982, Orient-Express Hotels, which already owned the Hotel Cipriani in Venice bought the Villa San Michele and the surrounding land. A comprehensive restoration of the buildings was embarked upon, this time with the cooperation of the Florence Fine Arts Authority.

New Town Center (Maryland)

The New Town Center, now known as University Town Center, is located in Hyattsville, Prince George's County, Maryland, United States. It was a planned urban center designed by Edward Durell Stone and located on a parcel at the intersection of Belcrest Road and East-West Highway in Hyattsville, Maryland and across from the then new Prince George's Plaza. The initial construction on this development took place in 1963-64. A second phase commenced after the opening of the Prince George's Plaza, Washington Metro rapid transit station in 1993.
First Phase of Development.
The $78 million project was developed by Bancroft Construction, headed by Herschel and Marvin Blumberg who had originally purchased the site in 1954. The Blumberg brothers also developed the area of nearby Silver Spring, Maryland now known as the Rock Creek Woods Historic District. The original $5.5 million, Federal office building (now known as Metro 1) was occupied in 1963 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Architect Stone referred to the development as a "Rockefeller Center in the countryside." Other original buildings were the highrise apartments Plaza Towers West and Plaza Towers East, located at Toledo Terrace and Belcrest Road. The Metro 2 office building was completed in 1968 and the Metro 3 building in 1971.
The original concept for the New Town Center was for it to be "a planned residential, commercial, employment and social complex which, as yet (1963) has no equal in the Baltimore-Washington area." The Blumberg brothers' plans included interlocking residential and commercial facilities including the separation of pedestrian and automobile traffic and the enhancement of open spaces by the use of sunken reflecting pools, fountains, and plantings. Also included in the 1964 plans were two more Stone-designed office buildings (built in 1968 and 1972), another apartment structure (not built), a 1,400 seat motion picture theater (not built), and a huge ice skating rink (not built). Most dramatic were plans for multiple 34-story apartment towers, which would have been among the tallest structures in the Washington, DC area. Plans were also included for a Youth Center (built at Toledo and Adelphi Roads) and a $1.3 million Prince George's County Cultural Center (not built). Transportation plans in 1964 called for a spur from I-95 to be built just west of the tract (not built) and for underground rapid transit service to serve the Federal Building. Parks, schools, churches, and recreational facilities (some built) were expected to form a transitional buffer between the new developments and the surrounding single-family homes, in University Park, Maryland.
New Town Center did not develop as fully or rapidly as originally envisioned. The expected I-95 extension through Northeast Washington and Maryland suburbs never occurred, effectively isolating the area. Development of the Washington Metro did not occur until the 1970s and the Green Line was the last segment developed in the main system. Finally, the changing demographic characteristics of Prince George's County to majority-minority during the 1980s and 1990s soured the area to many developers.
Second Phase of Development.
However, interest in this area revived following the opening of the Prince George's Plaza Metro station in 1993. Still owned and controlled by Herschel Blumberg and renamed Prince George's Metro Center, the development was later renamed University Town Center when the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in 2000 decided to lease new headquarters space at the site. NCHS had previously been a tenant in one of the original office buildings and moved to its new headquarters in 2002 in the building named Metro Four. In August 2006, a 16-story student apartment with 910 beds opened at the site providing housing for students from 11 local colleges and universities. In 2007, a new main street dubbed America Boulevard opened, as did a 14-screen Regal movie theater complex, a variety of dining options, and two condominium buildings. Also located at University Town Center is a satellite campus of Prince George's Community College.
The development that restarted in the 2000s has been dubbed "the realization of a half-century old dream to counter the patterns of suburban sprawl."

The Revolutionists stop for Orangeade

"The Revolutionists stop for Orangeade" is a poem from the second, 1931,
edition of Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry,
"Harmonium."
Although the poem's title is not atypical in being gaudy, it may be an
exception to the rule that the titles of Stevens's poems are not
guides to their content. The revolutionists are imploring
their leader to let them stop singing in the sun, or at least to
resume singing in the shade. And while the captain starts the singing
in a voice rougher than a grinding shale, orangeade all around would
not be amiss.
The poem reflects Stevens's affection for the Caribbean, and it is as
light as a feather compared to other poems added to the 1931 edition
of "Harmonium", like "Sea Surface full of Clouds".
Direct address and imperative mood ("Ask us not...", "Sing a
song...", "Wear the breeches...", "Hang a feather...") keeps the
pace brisk in the poem's four stanzas, enhanced in the fourth by the
unusual rhyming.

The Australian specification V240 comes standard with a 2.4-litre four-cylinder petrol engine producing 134 hp (100 kW) and of torque which is licenced from Mitsubishi Motors. In some markets, it is offered with a GW2.8TC diesel engine. V240 is specified as standard with alloy wheels, AM/FM CD radio, electric windows, leather trimmed seats, disc/drum brakes and air-conditioning.
In 2010, a single-cab model was released which, in the Australian market, replaced the SA220 (Great Wall Sailor). In 2011 the dual-cab V240 was upgraded to the newly released Wingle 5.

Bad Samaritan

The Bad Samaritan is a fictional character published by DC Comics. His first appearance was in "The Outsiders" vol. 1 #3, (January 1986), and he was created by Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo.
Publication history.
Because of publication differences between "Batman and the Outsiders", "The Outsiders" vol. 1, and "Adventures of the Outsiders", the Bad Samaritan's first published appearance was not his first in appearance in DC Comics' shared fictional universe. His first chronological appearance was in "The Outsiders" #3 (January 1986), but according to The Outsiders #4 where he refers to events that occurred in "Adventures of the Outsiders" #34 (June 1986), which was the first time he ever met Geo-Force. His first actual in universe appearance occurred in "Batman and the Outsiders" #32, (April 1986).
Fictional character biography.
Outsiders.
The Bad Samaritan first appears as a Soviet adviser to Baron Bedlam during his attempted takeover of the Markovian government. When Baron Bedlam's true intentions are revealed, that he wishes to resurrect Adolf Hitler, the Bad Samaritan turns against him, and later makes his escape after a short period of imprisonment.
He is later seen brokering a deal with Mikhail Gorbachev to bankrupt the American economy, the plan he moves ahead with results in the accidental theft from Fort Knox of printing plates used to create both United States and Markovian currency. While attempting to track down the Bad Samaritan and retrieve the plates, the Outsiders come into conflict with the Force of July on two separate occasions. During the second conflict, the Force of July are captured by the Soviet Navy; the Force of July are later rescued by the Outsiders and Mikhail Gorbachev himself returns the stolen treasury plates and orders both teams to leave Russia. After seeing both American teams, Gorbachev tells the Bad Samaritan that he wishes for the Soviet Union to create its own superhumans.
The Bad Samaritan next shows up as a Russian advisor to the fictional African country of Mozambia; with him is the first team of superhumans commisssioned by Premier Gorbachev based on technology used to create the Force of July. This team is called the People's Heroes. The Outsiders are captured and enslaved by the People's Heroes but eventually escape and help overthrow the government of Mozambia. While departing the African continent, their aircraft is shot down over a desert island by the Bad Samaritan flying a Soviet Mikoyan MiG-31.
Power Company.
In "Power Company: Josiah Power" #1, the Bad Samaritan is briefly seen assisting a crime ring that specializes in forcing victims of the Dominators' gene bomb to commit crimes with their newfound superhuman powers. With the help from one of the victims, lawyer Josiah Power, the Justice League International is able to defeat the evil organization.
Checkmate.
The Bad Samaritan resurfaces in "Checkmate" #22 as the White Queen's Bishop. In issue #23 his true name "Zviad Baazovi", and his Georgian nationality are revealed.

Louis Legrand (theologian)

Louis Legrand, S.S. (b. Lusigny-sur-Ouche, Burgundy, 12 June 1711, d. at Issy, Île-de-France, 21 July 1780) was a French Sulpician priest and theologian, and a Doctor of the Sorbonne. 
Life.
After studying philosophy and theology at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice, Paris, Legrand taught philosophy at Clermont, 1733–1736, and then resumed his studies in Paris, where he entered the Society of Saint-Sulpice in 1739 and obtained the licentiate in 1740. He taught theology at Cambrai, 1740–1743, was superior of the seminary in Autun, 1743–1745, and, having been recalled to Paris, received the degree of Doctor of Theology from the Sorbonne in 1746. Henceforth he remained at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in various employments.
Appointed director of studies in 1767 he exercised in this capacity an influence over young seminarians of France, who were preparing to take their degrees at the Sorbonne. As a Doctor of the Sorbonne he was called upon to take a prominent part in framing the decisions and censures of the theological faculty; in that intense period of opposition to Christian dogma, he was centrally involved in its defense. 
Works.
It was Legrand who wrote the condemnation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's "Emile, or On Education" (reprinted in Migne's "Theologiae Cursus Completus", II, col. 1111-1248). 
Legrand also drafted the censures of Marmontel's "Bélisaire" and Isaac-Joseph Berruyer's "Histoire du Peuple de Dieu". He helped to avert a censure of Buffon's "Epoques de la Nature", in consideration of the author's retraction. Legrand's moderation and kindliness gained the esteem and good will of both Buffon and Marmontel. 
Most of what Legrand wrote was in collaboration. Nearly all the writings of Legrand were included by Migne in his "Theologiae Cursus Completus". The most important are:
Parts of Legrand's "Tractatus de Ecclesia" have been reproduced by Migne in his "Scripturae Sacrae Cursus Completus", IV. At the time of his death, Legrand left an unfinished treatise, "De Existentia Dei" (Paris, 1812).

National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse

The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) was established in 2001 to improve the availability, capacity and effectiveness of drug treatment. 
It was set up as a special health authority within the National Health Service and its role was to deliver the ambitions of the 2010 Drug Strategy across the treatment sector. That ambition was for drug and alcohol users to become free of their dependence and to reintegrate into society, working, bringing up their children and having positive social relationships.
The NTA itself did not provide treatment, but worked in partnership with local commissioners and treatment providers to improve the quality of services, promote evidence-based practice and improve the skills of the drug treatment workforce. It also monitored the performance of the drug treatment sector through the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS).
After reviewing all its arm’s-length bodies in July 2010, the government decided the NTA would cease to exist as a statutory organization. Its key functions transferred to Public Health England on 1 April 2013.
In 2011, NTA issued a guide to safeguarding children affected by substance misuse.

UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict

United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict is an international body within the United Nations system. Its stated purpose is to unite the work of 13 UN entities with the goal of ending sexual violence in conflict. It is a concerted effort by the United Nations to improve coordination and accountability, amplify programming and advocacy, and support national efforts to prevent sexual violence and respond effectively to the needs of survivors.
The United Nations established United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict in response to calls from women’s rights organizations, NGOs and rape survivors for the United Nations to do much more to address sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence within a humanitarian and human rights legal framework. It reinforces efforts by United Nations entities to better coordinate and streamline their activities, working as “one United Nations” at country and global levels.
United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict is committed to aligning the United Nation’s work more effectively behind national efforts to address sexual violence, and to deepen partnerships with the many NGOs and civil society organizations that have been actively working to end sexual violence in conflict for many years. It operates through existing United Nations coordination mechanisms including the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC). It strengthens the work of the humanitarian Protection Cluster, and supports efforts to put an end to sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations personnel. United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict aims to strengthen efforts to protect women and girls from sexual violence during and after conflict – recognizing that the problem is much more than a security or humanitarian issue. United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict supports women’s engagement in conflict prevention and enhances women’s influence over peace negotiations and post conflict recovery processes. This helps ensure that sexual violence is on the agenda of the police, security forces, justice, and government sectors after conflict. United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict seeks to strengthen services provided to survivors, including medical care, legal support and economic security required to rebuild their lives. United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict also connects with governance and reform processes that improve women’s access to decision-making and strengthen their voices in public affairs, with the long term view of tackling gender-specific power imbalances.
Areas of Focus.
United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict has three main pillars:
Organization Structure.
United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict is led by a Secretariat that coordinates the 13 members, Additionally, it is governed by a Steering Committee comprising Principals from the 13 UN entity members. An executive sub-group of the Steering Committee, made up of focal points from the UN entity members, develops the Strategic Framework for UN Action.
Members.
United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict comprises the following 13 United Nations entities: the Department of Political Affairs (DPA), the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Joint United Nations Program of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO).
Wilton Park Conference.
From May 27 - 29, 2008, UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict led a conference in Wilton Park, UK, entitled “Women Targeted or Affected by Armed Conflict: What Role for Military Peacekeepers?” In the 60th anniversary year of international peacekeeping, and coinciding with the commemorative day of international peacekeepers, the conference covered what more can be done by international peacekeepers to protect women from sexual violence and other abuse in armed conflict and its aftermath.
Senior military personnel, including former commanders of international peace support operations, United Nations officials, policy makers and other experts, met to discuss how to improve political and tactical responses to protect women in war.
Among those attending were:
United Nations Resolution 1820.
On June 19th, 2008, the 15-member UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1820 (2008) on Sexual Violence against Civilians in Conflict, after a day-long ministerial-level meeting on “women, peace and security .” The Resolution condemns the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence in conflict situations, stating that rape can constitute a war crime, a crime against humanity, or a constitutive act with respect to genocide.
The Resolution also calls for effective steps to prevent and respond to acts of sexual violence as a way of contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security – including urging Member States to comply with their obligations for prosecuting the perpetrators of sexual violence, ensuring that all victims of sexual violence, particularly women and girls, have equal protection under the law and equal access to justice, and ending impunity for sexual violence as part of a comprehensive approach to seeking sustainable peace, justice, truth, and national reconciliation.

<doc id="18810701" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18810701" title="MacPublisher">
MacPublisher

MacPublisher was the first Desktop Publishing program for the Apple Macintosh, introduced in 1984, the same year that Apple introduced the Macintosh. DTP competitors Ready,Set,Go! and Aldus PageMaker were introduced in 1985 when Apple delivered the 512K Macintosh.
MacPublisher was developed by Bob Doyle (inventor) and distributed by Boston Software Publishers.
Built on graphics primitives like QuickDraw that Bill Atkinson had originally developed for the Apple Lisa computer, MacPublisher included WYSIWYG layout for multi-column text and graphics. QuickDraw was incorporated in the Pascal toolbox for the new Macintosh and had been the basis for MacPaint.
The Desktop Publishing industry exploded in the year 1985 with the introduction of the Apple LaserWriter printer in January and in July the 512K "Big Mac" and Aldus Corporation's PageMaker, which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software.
It was Paul Brainerd, Aldus' chairman, who gave the industry the name "desktop publishing." MacPublisher had been called "electronic publishing," after the industry then led by Atex Corporation, of which Brainerd had been a vice president. 
MacPublisher was the first non-Apple application program to print in color on the ImageWriter II. It introduced spot color to desktop publishing. MacPublisher III was the first DTP program to rotate text and graphics, using a table look-up for the necessary sine functions in one-degree increments.
MacPublisher builds a page differently than PageMaker and ReadySetGo do; instead of creating an actual image of the page with all the text and graphics, MacPublisher created a page mockup that contains only rectangles that represent the location and size of text and graphic elements, and stored the elements as special text and picture files that you edit separately from the page layout. MacPublisher rebuilds a page whenever it changes. The company says it took this approach to allow creation of master pages, repeating elements, and predefined "canned" page layouts; to help prevent data loss on machines with limited memory (MacPublisher can run with as little as 128K RAM); and to facilitate the programming for the automatic table of contents and automatic page jump ("continued on page x") features. Since the page layout is independent of the text and graphic content, you can easily create publication formats you can reuse as you need them. This reusable formats feature can be especially useful for creating catalogs or other publications in which you want the format to remain the same but in which you need to update or replace information on a regular basis. MacPublisher features either automatic or manual kerning to correct printer spacing idiosyncrasies. 
MacPublisher included unusual desktop accessories such as a scissor tool to cut columns of text and paste the remainder into another page, a camera tool for capturing graphics from MacPaint, and a see-through ruler that could be moved around the page for measurements.
MacPublisher was sold in 1986 to Esselte Letraset, whose business in press-down dry transfer lettering was evaporating with competition from laser printers, notably Apple's pioneering LaserWriter printer. It was briefly sold as LetraPage, but dropped from the market when Letraset subsequently acquired Ready,Set,Go! from Manhattan Graphics.

Escobar and her husband Dario Xavier Garcia have one son, Dominic Ramses Garcia. She is currently coached by the Cuban Javier Perez Rosas, and trains in her home town of Esmeraldas. The government has provided her with facilities to train in and a monthly stipend to allow her to focus solely on weightlifting.
Early life.
From the start of her life Alexandra Escobar has had to fight for anything she wanted. Born into poverty, her parents sent her to be raised by a slightly better off aunt named Luisa Marquez at an early age. It was there in Luisa’s home that she was introduced to the sport that would change her life. Luisa’s daughter Adela and Escobar had to spend their days working as washwoman and babysitters for upper class families in order to help support the household. It was through Adela that Escobar found weightlifting. From an early age Escobar knew that sports would likely present the best opportunity to escape the poverty she had inherited at birth. She tried several sports growing up but didn’t excel at any, until she found weightlifting. She stumbled on the sport almost accidentally. Her “sister” Adela had taken up weightlifting at a local gym and Escobar happened to accompany her to the gym one day. During that visit in 1998 she participated in Adela’s workout, and caught the eye of a local coach, Silvio Mila. Mila practically refused to let Escobar walk away from the sport, and within four months Escobar had won her first event.
Pan American Championships.
While Alexandra Escobar has competed in three Olympic Games and several World Championships her greatest success has undoubtedly came at the Pan American Championships. She first appeared on the Pan American stage in 2008 at the games held in Callao, Peru when she swept the 58 kg events, winning three gold medals 1 each in the 58 kg, the 58 kg - snatch and the 58 kg - clean & jerk. Since the 2008 games in Callao Escobar has won 10 gold medals, 2 silvers and 1 bronze. Making that even more impressive, she won back to back to back gold medals in both the 58 kg and the 58 kg - clean & jerk during the 2008, 20009 and 2010 games. Escobar is showing no signs of slowing down either having recently won gold medals in 58 kg, the 58 kg - snatch and the 58 kg - clean & jerk events at the 2013 games held in Caracas, Venezuela.
Olympic Games.
Alexandra Escobar’s dream is to win an Olympic medal, and she has competed in three games so far. She first competed in the Olympics in 2004 at Athens, Greece. She then returned in the 2008 games at Beijing, China. Finally, she competed in London, England during the 2012 games. Prior to the 2012 games Escobar said:
Unfortunately, Escobar has yet to accomplish this goal as her best finish so far was fourth place in the 2008 games. In the opening ceremony of those games Escobar was the flag bearer for her home country Ecuador. Escobar considers this a great honor that was bestowed upon her. Her other finishes in the Olympics were 7th place in 2004 and 9th in 2012. After the disappointing finish in London there was some speculation that Escobar would retire as she has spoken about an interest in coaching and studying sports science. However this soon proved false as she has returned to competitions in 2013.
World championships.
Alexandra Escobar has competed in eight World Championships. She has won one gold medal, in 2001, and has finished second on two occasions, both occurring in the 2013 games held in Wroclaw, Poland. She has also won four bronze medals, in 2001, 2003 and 2013. Her medals have all came in the 58 kg, 58 kg - snatch and 58 kg - clean & jerk events.
Incontinence incident.
During the 2012 games in London, England Escobar had an incident where she urinated on herself during competition. It occurred while she was attempting to lift a 127 kg weight. While it embarrassing for her, Escobar reflected positively on the experience, and her overall experience at the games in an interview with the press.
Controversy.
In October 2003 Escobar threatened to boycott the World Championships that were being held in Vancouver, Canada later that year unless the governing committee canceled a twenty thousand dollar fine that was imposed on a fellow competitor. Ultimately, the issue was resolved and Escobar attended the games winning a bronze medal in the 58 kg - snatch event. This event painted Escobar as a martyr in the eyes of the weightlifting community, and garnered her significant respect among her fellow competitors.

Jiang Gaoming

Jiang Gaoming () is a professor and Ph.D. tutor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Botany.
He is also vice secretary-general of the UNESCO China-MAB (Man and the Biosphere) Committee and a member of the UNESCO MAB Urban Group. He is known for his concepts of “urban vegetation” and allowing damaged ecosystems to recover naturally.
Career.
Jiang received his Bachelor's degree in Botany at Shandong University in 1985
, and his Master's degree in Botany at the Institute of Botany Academia Sinica in 1988
. He received his Phd in Botany in 1993. He studied at the University of Liverpool from 1991 to 1992.
Jiang has done research on a wealth of topics. These topics include eco-environmental planning for middle-sized cities in China, bioindicating and biomonitoring of air pollution by plants, phosphorus cycling and chemical ecology, the ecology of colliery spoils, and urban vegetation. He initiated the first conference for the Young Chinese Botanists in Beijing 1987, and the first conference on Environment and Plant Resource Exploring in China in Changbaishan in 1988.
Jiang was the first person to chart the pollution history of Chengde in northern China. He was the first to explain why ancient pine trees in gardens were dying. He has also established models for monitoring sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution in woody plants.
Jiang noted the effects of tourism and urbanization on the Chengde Mountain Resort (also known as the Summer Villa estate), which is the largest existing imperial garden in China.
Jiang Gaoming is married to Jianjie Lu. They have a daughter.
Works.
Jiang has published hundreds of articles, papers, and books, a majority of which are in Chinese. His main topics include plant ecology and plant ecophysiology.
Positions.
In July Jiang asked the government to watch out for invasive species, especially during the Olympic games.
Jiang is eager to control desertification but he criticizes the government's policy of planting one species of trees.
Jiang thinks the main cause of desertification in Inner Mongolia is overgrazing. By 2000 some 80% of the grasslands in Hunshandake had deteriorated into desert, and 33% of the land had become mobile sand dunes. In the 1960s mobile sand dunes only made up 2% of the land. The first attempt to solve desertification involved planting 100,000 yuan (13,000 U.S. dollars) worth of willows, because conventional thought led Jiang to believe trees were the best solution to stop sandstorms.
Later Jiang's team tried a different approach. A 2670-hectare (26.7 km²) section of grassland in the Bayinhushuo Gacha was fenced off and no grazing was allowed.
The success achieved in Bayinhushuo Gacha quickly spread to the surrounding regions: several gachas followed suit, fencing off grasslands for natural restoration and thereby expanding the protected areas to more than 6500 hectares. Jiang is pleased that a policy of "ecological conservation first, ecological construction second" was included in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan on Ecological Protection.
Jiang supports burning straw instead of coal as a source of power. He estimated that a biomass power plant of 25,000 kW can generate 100,000 tons less carbon dioxide every year compared with the coal burning power plant of the same capacity. Furthermore, Jiang said that biomasses are less wasteful than coal. Thirty percent of burnt coal is waste while biomass burning generates just two percent and can be used as fertilizer after proper processing.
Jiang believes that the use of pesticides in Chinese farming can lead to poor quality and even dangerous food. “Farmers adopted certain production methods to make food-production cheaper. They use whichever chemicals are cheapest. The use of pesticide seems better, and it is cheap. In fact, the pesticides they would buy are also used as fertiliser, and this makes it all the more dangerous,” Jiang said.

John Fagan

John "Kruger" Fagan also known as Jackie Fagan, was an Irish football player and prominent member of the Shamrock Rovers team during the 1920s. He also played for the League of Ireland XI and Ireland. His son Paddy Fagan played for the Republic of Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s. They were the first father and son to play for an Ireland team selected by the FAI
Shamrock Rovers.
Fagan came from the Markets area of Dublin and was just under 5’ 2’ in height. Sean Ryan refers to him as veteran of the Irish War of Independence. In 1922–23 he helped Shamrock Rovers win their first League of Ireland title. During the 1924–25 season, together with Bob Fullam, John Joe Flood and Billy Farrell, he formed part of a legendary forward-line known as the "Four F's". He had a particular good partnership with Fullam. The season also saw Rovers win a League of Ireland, League of Ireland Shield and FAI Cup treble. They won the 1924–25 FAI Cup after beating Shelbourne 2-1 at Dalymount Park before an attendance of 25,000. Rovers went through the 1924–25 season undefeated and thus became the first side in the brief history of the League to win the title twice. Fagan also played and scored for Rovers in the 1925–26 FAI Cup final defeat to Fordsons. He helped Rovers win a third League of Ireland title in 1926–27. During the summer of 1929 he suffered a serious illness which effectively ended his Rovers career. He left the club in December but shortly afterwards featured as a left half for Kingswood in the Leinster Senior League Second Division. 
League of Ireland XI.
Between 1924 and 1927 Fagan also made five appearances for the League of Ireland XI. On 9 February 1924, he played in the selection first official game when they made their debut in a 3–3 draw against the Welsh Football League XI at Dalymount Park. Among his team mates were Frank Collins, Ernie MacKay, Bertie Kerr, Dave Roberts, Johnny McIlroy and Christy Robinson. Fagan provided two assists, with MacKay and Roberts both scoring from crosses he provided. On 13 March 1926 he also featured when the League of Ireland XI played the Irish League XI for the first time. His team mates this time included Collins, Frank Brady, Val Harris, Charlie Dowdall and the other three "Four F's". The League of Ireland XI won this game 3-1. 
FAI XI.
On 23 February 1924 Fagan also played for an FAI XI in a prestige friendly against Celtic. 18,000 turned up at Dalymount Park to see Celtic win 3-0. The game was used by the FAI to raise funds to help send a squad to the 1924 Olympic Games. His team mates for this game included Jack McCarthy, Val Harris, Ernie MacKay and Charlie Dowdall. 
Ireland.
Fagan made his only appearance for Ireland in a 3-0 away defeat against Italy on 21 March 1926. His team mates on this occasion included Harry Cannon, Frank Brady, Jack McCarthy, Dinny Doyle, John Joe Flood and Bob Fullam.

The Moapa practiced irrigation agriculture before contact with Europeans. The Moapa suffered from Spanish slave raiders' attacks in the 18th and early 19th centuries.
In 1869 the United States relocated the Southern Paiute to the Moapa area. Originally the entire Moapa River watershed and lands along the Colorado River (some of which area is now under Lake Mead) was assigned to the Moapa; however, in 1875 their reservation was reduced to . 
They later suffered from decimation by disease in the 1920s and 1930s.
In 1941, they organized with a formal constitution. In 1980 the Moapa River reservation was expanded, with about added. People on the reservation continue to suffer high rates of unemployment, resulting in some of the Moapa relocating elsewhere to find work.

It takes its name from the historic postcode of that area SO36, in which the SO stands for Südost (South East). The Kreuzberg district has historically been home to the Berlin "punk rock" movement, as well as other alternative subcultures in Germany.
SO36 was originally focused largely on punk music and in the 1970s was often frequented by musicians such as Iggy Pop, David Bowie, and Brandon Conde. After problems Martin Kippenberger took over the management in 1979 and tried to create a crossover between punk, new wave and visual art. In those days the club rivalled New York's "CBGB" as one of the finest new-wave venues in the world, however unlike CBGB the venue still stands today and remains a fixture on the Berlin music scene championing new artists, while staying true to its punk past.

Databank Systems Limited

Databank Systems Limited was the name of a not-for-profit "off balance sheet" company set up by a consortium of competing banks in New Zealand, to operate on what is nowadays termed a "Shared Services Agency" basis, to provide computing resources (development and operational) for the consortium members. The company was set up in 1967, and in 12 years grew to be the largest non-Government data processing organisation in the Southern Hemisphere, servicing more than 1,200 banking offices.
Purpose.
The purpose of Databank was defined within a set of contractual obligations in the "1969 Processing Agreement". The Agreement was between the consortium members, and was essentially about the services and service levels to be provided by Databank, and the constraints that would exist to ensure that lead bank ownership of any new application/system, and bank competitiveness, were maintained.
History.
The formation of Databank came at a time when computer systems were a scarce and expensive commodity in New Zealand, with the import of computers being restricted by the then government's prevailing highly regulatory economic policy. Computers could only be imported under licence. The executive management of the BNZ (Bank of New Zealand) wanted to obtain a computer and establish a computerised system to enable the automation of the processing of its banking transactions and customer accounting. Computerisation was deemed as the only way to proceed if the increasing cheque transaction volumes were to be accommodated in timely fashion. The other, smaller banks were approaching the point where they would face a similar situation. However, the NBNZ (National Bank of New Zealand) was the only one that happened to have a computer import licence. 
Thus, the initial teaming-up was between the BNZ and NBNZ in 1966, and they set up Databank in 1967. The three other trading banks subsequently joined the consortium in 1968. Decimal currency was introduced in New Zealand on 10 July 1967. 
Incorporation.
Databank was incorporated in 1967 in Wellington, New Zealand, to deliver services to the then statutorily mandated trading banks of New Zealand. The founding CEO was one Gordon Hogg of the BNZ also known as the "bright brain" of BNZ. Ian Archibald was hired from the Bank of Scotland and worked closely with Gordon Hogg. Gordon worked well with Ian who was much more cautious. Gordon stayed at the company until he was obliged by the Databank Board to take early retirement in 1988.
The consortium of shareholder-customers of Databank had ownership distributed thus:
By 1984, the consortium ownership of Databank had changed due to the merger of BNSW and CBA banks, thus:
Operation.
A national computerised network was set up with overnight processing of transactions, initially on IBM System/360 Model 40 computers. Money Transfer Services (MTS) were introduced in February 1969, and all branches of the trading banks were converted to computer processing by November 1969. In 1974/75 chequing accounts were introduced by the Post Office Savings Bank and several trustee savings banks. 
The Labour Government elected in 1984 commenced a comprehensive restructuring of the New Zealand economy, including banking deregulation. Since Databank essentially owned the New Zealand payments system, which was operated through and by Databank, the existing clearing systems had to be opened up to new banks entering the market, to provide what was referred to as a "level playing field".
By 1988, Databank had become an increasingly large operational cost for the banks, who questioned whether they were continuing to receive value for money. A 1989 legal decision, that inter-company transactions (i.e., between Databank and the consortium members) must carry GST meant that the long-term cost-effectiveness of Databank was no longer likely, and that it had become a financial risk. The decision was thus eventually taken by the banks to split off the core and common payments system processing of Databank and put it under the ownership of a new all-bank forum called ISL (Interchange and Settlement Ltd), and plans were put in place to dismantle Databank and sell it.
Sale and Closure.
Between 1992 and 1994, all major development of new banking systems by Databank was aborted, the development projects were closed down and the associated personnel were retrenched. This was managed by the then CEO, Tony Hood, who had formerly been a Commercial Services Manager at Databank, and later the Chief Manager of IT at the Westpac Bank. He was appointed as CEO by the Board of Databank, and assigned the task of disposing of the company.
In 1994, Databank was sold to the US company Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS) - a General Motors Corporation subsidiary - for an undisclosed price. Tony Hood became the EDS CEO, resigning from EDS in 1996.
The Databank subsidiary, Databank Investments Ltd, was part of the job lot. At the time, Databank employed about 950 people. EDS' acquisition of Databank was intended to give it a base for further expansion, either by further takeovers or by selling services in the region.
A Commerce Commission report on the sale stated: "The proposed acquisition of Databank Systems Ltd is in line with Electronic Data Systems Corporation’s strategic plan for the Asia/Pacific area and will result in the establishment of a significant banking services organisation based in New Zealand. The Commission is advised there are plans to offer information technology services to non-banking customers as well."
About 25% of Databank’s turnover at the time was via its Commercial Services arm, to customers other than its four former owners.

Sherman College of Chiropractic

Sherman College of Chiropractic is a private college founded in 1973, offering the doctor of chiropractic degree, that was named after Lyle Sherman. The college is home to approximately 200 students representing 26 states and 15 countries and has more than 3,000 alumni around the world. The name of the college was changed to Sherman College of Straight Chiropractic the late 1970s, but changed in the Health Center for use of interns and local chiropractors.
Program.
The program consists of 14 quarters of study: classroom and hands-on instruction, internship in the Chiropractic Health Center, research opportunities, and community services. To enter the program, students must have 90 hours of college credits, including hours in lab sciences. Sherman College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and by the Commission of Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Education, as well as being licensed by the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education.
Campus.
The campus is located in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The college operates a Chiropractic Health Center on its campus open to the public, which provides more than 30,000 patient visits each year. Sherman was the first East Coast chiropractic college to use digital x-ray imaging for health center and local chiropractor patients. The Health Center also supports Chiropractic research on vertebral subluxation.
Seminars.
Each year on Memorial Day weekend, Sherman College sponsors the Lyceum, a conference of seminars, workshops, awards, presentation of research and fellowship for the chiropractic community. Another series is IRAPS, the International Research and Philosophy Symposium, a weekend of presentations which focus on innate intelligence and vitalistic philosophy as well as research findings.
History.
Established in 1973 by Dr. Thom Gelardi, the college is named for Dr. Lyle Sherman, an assistant director of the B. J. Palmer Chiropractic Research Clinic. The first class graduated on September 18, 1976, the anniversary of Palmer's discovery of the vertebral subluxation. After several years in alternate locations in Spartanburg, the college opened the present campus, which now includes a teaching facility, a health center open to the public, and a fitness center for faculty and students. Sherman focuses on the correction of vertebral subluxations of the spine rather than diagnosis and treatment of symptoms in the modern medicine model; a philosophy it defended in an accreditation lawsuit with the American Chiropractic Association in 1986.

Roger Kimpton

Roger Charles MacDonald Kimpton, DFC (21 September 1916 – 30 November 1999) was an Australian
cricketer who played 62 first-class games, mostly in the late 1930s. The majority of his appearances were for Oxford University and Worcestershire, although he appeared for the Gentlemen in both 1936 and 1937 (only the latter game being played at Lord's) and for an England XI in 1937.
Unusually, he alternated somewhat between keeping wicket and bowling, although his success with the ball was limited.
Aged 18, Kimpton made his first-class debut for Oxford against his future county, Worcestershire, at The Parks in early May 1935, a game which the university won by an innings. Kimpton showed his versatility by scoring 38, bowling five (admittedly wicketless) overs and claiming a catch and a stumping (even though Norman Knight was Oxford's named keeper).
In his second match, Kimpton made what was to remain his career best innings when he hit 160 versus Gloucestershire; these runs were hit in 155 minutes, and included a whirlwind hour in which he added 138 with Sandy Singleton.
His seven further games for Oxford that summer were relatively uneventful.
In early May 1936 Kimpton again punished Gloucestershire, scoring a century in each innings.
Later that same month he hit a second-innings 102 (from number eight) in 70 minutes — despite needing a runner — against Lancashire,
then followed that up with 110 not out and 85 against Free Foresters; in the latter game he also took a career best 4-42.
He was picked for the Gentlemen v Players game at Folkestone at the end of the summer, and scored 115.
Kimpton's hundred against Lancashire had put him on course for that season's Walter Lawrence Trophy, but Leslie Ames pipped him to the title by two minutes in the very last match of the year.
1937 saw Kimpton make his debut in county cricket, although he continued to turn out for Oxford. He had by some distance his most productive season, scoring 1,568 runs in all first-class cricket at an average of 34.84, although despite a dozen innings between 50 and 99 he only managed one century. This, the only three-figure score he ever made for Worcestershire, came against Derbyshire in late August.
In July he made his second appearance for the Gentlemen, this time at Lord's, and struck 59 in the first innings,
while at the end of the summer he represented an England XI against the New Zealanders at Folkestone.
Kimpton played ten games in 1938, including two on the joint Oxford and Cambridge Universities tour of Jamaica in August, but found little success, making only two half-centuries and averaging under 24. He played no cricket in 1939, and with the outbreak of the Second World War he returned to Australia to join the RAAF as a fighter pilot. In this role he won the DFC, the citation noting his "aggressive and determined leadership" during 140 sorties over the Pacific Ocean.
After the war Kimpton played little, being largely occupied with the family business in Melbourne,
but he did make three further first-class appearances. There was a one-off game for Worcestershire in 1949, in which he showed his continuing ability by taking 93* off Nottinghamshire;
and in 1955-56 he accepted an invitation from E. W. Swanton to join his tour to the West Indies, playing his final two matches at the age of 39.
As well as cricket, Kimpton was an accomplished tennis player, winning the freshmen's tournament; he also achieved a blue at golf.
His brother Stephen played four matches for Oxford University in 1935, appearing alongside Roger in two of them.

Electrical brain stimulation

Electrical brain stimulation (EBS), also referred to as focal brain stimulation (FBS), is a form of electrotherapy and technique used in research and clinical neurobiology to stimulate a neuron or neural network in the brain through the direct or indirect excitation of its cell membrane by using an electric current. It is used for research or for therapeutical purposes.
History.
Electrical brain stimulation was first used in the first half of the 19th century by pioneering researchers such as Luigi Rolando (1773–1831) and Pierre Flourens (1794–1867), to study the brain localization of function, following the discovery by Italian physician Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) that nerves and muscles were electrically excitable. The stimulation of the surface of the cerebral cortex by using brain stimulation was used to investigate the motor cortex in animals by researchers such as Eduard Hitzig (1838–1907), Gustav Fritsch (1838–1927), David Ferrier (1842–1928) and Friedrich Goltz (1834–1902). The human cortex was also stimulated electrically by neurosurgeons and neurologists such as Robert Bartholow (1831–1904) and Fedor Krause (1857–1937).
In the following century, the technique was improved by the invention of the stereotactic method by British neurosurgeon pioneer Victor Horsley (1857–1916), and by the development of chronic electrode implants by Swiss neurophysiologist Walter Rudolf Hess (1881–1973), José Delgado (1915-2011) and others, by using electrodes manufactured by straight insulated wire that could be inserted deep into the brain of freely-behaving animals, such as cats and monkeys. This approach was used by James Olds (1922–1976) and colleagues to discover brain stimulation reward and the pleasure center. American-Canadian neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield (1891–1976) and colleagues at the Montreal Neurological Institute used extensively electrical stimulation of the brain cortex in awake neurosurgical patients to investigate the motor and sensory homunculus (the representation of the body in the brain cortex according to the distribution of motor and sensory territories).
Process.
Two-photon excitation microscopy has shown that microstimulation activates neurons sparsely around the electrode even at low currents (as low as 10 μA) up to distances as far as four millimeters away. This happens without particularly selecting other neurons much nearer the electrode's tip. This is due to activation of neurons being determined by whether they do or do not have axons or dendrites that pass within a radius of 15 μm near the tip of the electrode. As the current is increased the volume around the tip that activates neuron axons and dendrites increases and with this the number of neurons activated. Activation is most likely to be due to direct depolarization rather than synaptic activation.
Therapeutic applications.
Examples of therapeutic EBS are:
Strong electric currents may cause a localized lesion in the nervous tissue, instead of a functional reversible stimulation. This property has been used for neurosurgical procedures in a variety of treatments, such as for Parkinson's disease, focal epilepsy and psychosurgery. Sometimes the same electrode is used to probe the brain for finding defective functions, before passing the lesioning current (electrocoagulation).

2007–08 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season

The 2007–08 season was the 130th season in Bolton Wanderers F.C.'s existence, and was their 7th consecutive year in the top-flight, and covers the period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008. Having finished seventh the previous season, Bolton had qualified for the UEFA Cup.
Regular season.
After finishing runners-up in the Peace Cup Bolton entered the new season under the management of Sammy Lee. Lee, who had previously worked under former manager Sam Allardyce, had taken over from Allardyce towards the end of the previous season, but had yet to record a league win.
The league season kicked off at home, against Newcastle United, now managed by Allardyce. Three first-half goals for Newcastle ensured an early defeat. This was followed by an away defeat to Fulham. By the time Bolton lost 3–0 to Portsmouth, the club found itself at the bottom of the league. However, a 3–0 win over Reading lifted them off the basement. Another bright note was that striker Nicolas Anelka had found the net in three of the four games in August and found himself towards the top of the Premier League scoring charts.
Back to back defeats to Everton and Birmingham City saw Bolton quickly return to the bottom three and Lee come under pressure for his job. An unconvincing away draw in the UEFA Cup to Macedonian side FK Rabotnički, only saved by a late equaliser from Abdoulaye Méïté, was followed by a 1–1 home draw against fellow strugglers Tottenham Hotspur. Much-needed relief was found in an extra time win over Fulham in the Carling Cup but an early season six pointer against bottom side Derby County only yielded a draw and meant that Bolton finished September only one place above their opponents.
The UEFA Cup home leg against FK Rabotnički was won 1–0 with another goal from Anelka. However, if Bolton were looking for an easy passage through the group stage they were disappointed as the draw put them up against former European Cup winners Bayern Munich and Red Star Belgrade as well as highly regarded Portuguese side S.C. Braga and Aris from Greece. Meanwhile, there appeared to be problems at the club behind-the-scenes, marked by the confusion when Gary Speed stepped down as player-coach. However, there was little confusion to what happened following Bolton's 2–0 home defeat to Chelsea on 15 October, with Lee being relieved of his duties on the Monday. Assistant manager Archie Knox was put in temporary charge until a new manager was found. Steve Bruce, Paul Jewell and Chris Coleman were linked to the job. In the meantime Bolton lost again, this time to Arsenal 2–0 on 25 October Gary Megson was appointed as manager following his resignation from Leicester City. While chairman Phil Gartside said ""We feel Gary is the right man to take Bolton forward"", some fans were decidedly unimpressed, stating that it was ""possibly the most bizarre and clueless appointment this season"". Megson sat in the dugout for 1-1 draw that evening at home to Braga in the UEFA Cup before taking charge fully in the home game against Aston Villa, that also finished 1–1.
The month finished with Bolton being knocked out of the |Carling Cup by neighbours Manchester City 1–0, the game being settled late on by a controversial penalty.
A late Kevin Nolan goal saved the day at West Ham in the first game in November. Bolton then travelled to Germany to take on Bayern Munich. Few fancied Bolton to come away with a result, but an early goal from Ricardo Gardner and a late equaliser from Kevin Davies gave Bolton a valuable point in their attempt to qualify from the group stage. Seemingly buoyed by this result Bolton finished the month unbeaten, drawing 0–0 with Middlesbrough, beating Manchester United 1–0 (giving Megson his first win as manager and Bolton's first home win against their neighbours for thirty years) and drawing with Aris in the UEFA Cup, Stelios Giannakopoulos scoring an injury-time equaliser against his countrymen.
Bolton's busiest month of the campaign started with a 4–0 hammering at the hands of Liverpool at Anfield. but this was quickly followed by another famous European night as Red Star Belgrade were beaten 1–0 as Bolton qualified for the last thirty-two of the UEFA Cup, the occasion slightly marred when some fans were held in a hotel in the Serbian capital. This was followed by a 4–1 derby win over Wigan Athletic, in what turned out to be Gary Speed's last game for the club, and another derby defeat to Manchester City, 4–2. When the draw for the last thirty-two of the UEFA Cup was made, Bolton were given another tough draw, paired with Spaniards Atlético Madrid. The day after the draw was made fellow strugglers Birmingham City were despatched 3–0, but this was followed by two defeats over the Christmas period to Everton and Sunderland.
The new year started with an unconvincing last-minute win over Derby County, Stelios Giannakopoulos again coming up with a winner. The game proved to be Nicolas Anelka's last game for the club before he was sold to Chelsea for £15 million. Other players to leave in the transfer window were Gary Speed, Christian Wilhelmsson, Gérald Cid and Lubomir Michalik. Megson used this opportunity to strengthen the defence with the purchases of Grétar Steinsson from AZ Alkmaar and Gary Cahill from Aston Villa. Matt Taylor, who had scored against Bolton earlier in the season for his previous club Portsmouth, was also brought in, as was Tamir Cohen from Maccabi Netanya. Surprisingly, the only like-for-like replacement for Anelka brought in was Grzegorz Rasiak on loan from Championship side Southampton. An early FA Cup defeat to Sheffield United could be put down to Megson putting out a largely reserve side. This was followed by another derby defeat to Blackburn Rovers before two successive 0–0 draws, away to Newcastle United, by now managed by Kevin Keegan, and then home to Fulham.
A 2–0 victory over Reading gave Bolton a much-needed three points over relegation rivals and gave them their first double over a team for the season but this proved to be Bolton's last win in the league until mid-April as they embarked on a run that put them back into the bottom three. A game that they dominated against Portsmouth ended up as a 1–0 defeat. The next two games were the UEFA Cup home-and-away legs against Atlético Madrid. A 1–0 victory at home, courtesy of an El Hadji Diouf goal, was followed by a 0–0 draw away, meaning that Bolton would go further in Europe this season than in their previous UEFA Cup attempt two seasons previously. However, there was trouble again for some Bolton fans, with seventeen being injured in what was seen as ""heavy handed tactics"" by Spanish police. Both Bolton and Athletico Madrid were subject to a UEFA investigation. Bolton were drawn against Sporting Lisbon in the last sixteen of the competition. On their return home Bolton were beaten again by Blackburn Rovers, 4–1.
Bolton's season reached its nadir in the month of March, with only one point being gained in the league. A 3–1 defeat to Liverpool was epitomised by a bizarre own goal scored by Jussi Jääskeläinen. Bolton then met Sporting Lisbon home and away in the UEFA Cup. A 1–1 draw at home was followed by a 1–0 defeat away. Megson suffered criticism as again he had put a weakened side out in a cup competition, but he vindicated his choice by stating that Premiership survival was more important. Fans who had travelled to Lisbon for the game were not happy with this excuse and they were made to feel worse when a virtually wholly changed side lost to Wigan Athletic in the following league game, despite being up against ten men for the majority of the game. In the following game, Cristiano Ronaldo put two early goals into Bolton's net to continue Manchester United's push for the title. Despite picking up a point a week later at home to United's city rivals with a goalless draw, a week later Bolton managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by throwing away a two goal lead against ten-man Arsenal to lose 2–3.
Bolton entered April knowing that they would probably have to go undefeated through to the end of the season to avoid relegation, but got off to the worst possible start with a 4–0 defeat to Aston Villa. However, two successive victories at home to West Ham and away to Middlesbrough took them out of the bottom three and left them in control of their own destiny, even after being outplayed but still drawing at Tottenham.
Bolton's penultimate game of the season, at home to Sunderland, kicked off at 5:15pm with Bolton having the knowledge that, as Birmingham City and Reading had lost earlier that day, a win would virtually secure their Premiership status. And win they did, with goalscorer El Hadji Diouf doing a personal lap of honour at the end of the game after stating that he would be leaving the club, even though he wasn't out of contract. The final game, away to title chasing Chelsea, finished 1–1 with Matt Taylor scoring Bolton's final goal of the season and making sure that they did not avoid relegation on goal difference.

A Complete History of My Sexual Failures

A Complete History of My Sexual Failures is a 2008 British documentary film directed by Chris Waitt who also starred as the main character and composed some of the music. The film was part of the "World Cinema Documentary Competition" at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.
Plot.
Filmmaker Chris Waitt sets out on a quest to find out why his romantic relationships have ended in complete failure. Tracking down most every one of his former lovers, he finds a general resentment, stemming from his constant unreliability. He then sets out to test different approaches that will prepare him for true love, and a lasting relationship.
Reception.
Reviews of the film were mixed, with Rotten Tomatoes giving the film 56%. Dennis Harvey, writing for "Variety", was generally positive, and commended Waitt for his willingness "to appear a complete (though endearing) ass", while suspecting he was not quite as dumb as he appeared. "The Independent", "The Independent On Sunday", "The Times", "The Financial Times" and "The Sun" all gave the movie four stars.
"The Daily Telegraph"'s Mike McCahill, doubting the veracity of Waitt's story, concluded that "It's a display of gross bad faith both as documentarist and lover, and its subject probably deserves never to get laid again." 
On the other hand, Toby Young writing in "The Independent", despite thinking that "If Waitt was an employee of the BBC he'd be dragged before a series of committees before being tossed into the street" nonetheless concluded that "this doesn't matter at all" as the film was "so funny I thought I would pass out".
Remake.
In March 2009, "Variety" announced that Universal Pictures had bought the remake rights for the movie, and intend to produce a narrative feature remake to be directed by Jay Roach, and produced by Neal Moritz from a script by Jay Reiss. Chris Waitt and Henry Trotter (producer of the original documentary) will executive produce.

Shivwits Band of Paiutes

The Shivwits Band of Paiutes are a band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, a federally recognized tribe of Southern Paiutes located in southwestern Utah.
History.
The Shivwits Paiutes settled in Utah around 1100 CE. They hunted rabbits, deer, and mountain sheep and gathered seeds, roots, tubers, berries, and nuts, particularly pine nuts. They were farmers living along the Santa Clara River and the Virgin River and cultivated crops of corn, squash, melons, gourds, sunflowers, and, after European contact, winter wheat.
The Dominguez-Escalante Expedition of 1776 was most likely the Shivwits' first contact with Europeans. Fur trader Jedediah Smith created a route to California directly through Paiute territory. The 19th century brought non-Native trappers, traders, and settlers to the area. The newly introduced livestock had a negative effect on the area's delicate ecology. Utes and Navajos often captured Paiute women and children and sold them to European-Americans as slaves. Mormons permanently settled on Paiute lands in the 1850s, putting an end to the Shivwits' traditional lifestyle.
Their reservation was formed in 1891 with only . It did not receive water rights so they were forced to abandon farming. The reservation had a population of 194 in that year. There were 154 Shivwits in 1906. The Shivwits Band of Paiute Indians of Utah first received federal recognition on March 3, 1891 as the "Shebit tribe of Indians in Washington County, Utah."
Along with other Utah Paiute tribes, the Shivwits' relationship with the federal government was terminated in the 1950s. Unlike other Paiute groups the Shivwits retained ownership of their lands after termination and leased them to ranchers instead of selling them outright.
Name.
Shivwits or Shivwitz comes from the Southern Paiute word, "sipicimi". The word may be based on the prefix "sibi"-, meaning "east" or "si-vints"', meaning "people who live in the east." It is also spelled Shi'-vwits, She-bits, Sübü'ts, and Sebit. The Shivwits Plateau in Arizona is named for the tribe.
Recent developments.
The Shivwits regained federal recognition through an act signed by President Jimmy Carter on 3 April 1980. The reservation is larger than it was originally, covering over .
In 2003 the Shivwits received water rights for annually, enabling the tribe to create new economic development projects.
Today.
The tribe is headquartered in Ivins, located in Washington County, Utah. Their Band Chairperson is Jetta Wood.

<doc id="18811269" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18811269" title="Adonijah Bidwell">
Adonijah Bidwell

Early life.
Adonijah Bidwell was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1716. The son of Thomas Bidwell, a wealthy merchant involved in the triangular trade, Adonijah had a comfortable childhood. As a young adult, Adonijah Bidwell attended Yale College and graduated in 1740. He was intermittently a teacher, a chaplain for the British and colonial expeditions to Canada and, finally, a full-time minister for Township No. 1 in Monterey, Massachusetts.
Career beginnings.
In 1745 he was the chaplain on the William Pepperell expedition to Louisbourg during King George's War. He chaplained other expeditions and ships between 1744 and 1747, and in 1748, accepted an offer to become the first minister of Township No. 1. 
His house, finished in 1750, was located north of the Township No. 1 Meeting House. The Bidwell House Museum is now located in Monterey, Massachusetts.
Family life.
In 1752, Adonijah Bidwell married Theodosia Colton of Suffield, Connecticut, a poet and the daughter of his former tutor. It was a childless marriage, and lasted until Theodosia's death in 1759 of unknown causes. A year after Theodosia died, he married Jemima Devotion of West Hartford, Connecticut, his second wife and a first cousin of Theodosia. They had four children: Adonijah the Younger, Barnabas Bidwell, Jemima Bidwell, and Theodosia Bidwell. Adonijah the Younger inherited the family farm, while Barnabas Bidwell became a member of the United States House of Representatives. He was later accused of embezzling money and fled to Canada. Jemima Devotion died in 1771. One year later, Reverend Bidwell married Ruth Kent of Suffield, Connecticut to take care of his four children. Ruth outlived the Reverend. After Adonijah's death, she married a Jonathan Judd, a second widower who was also a minister in Great Barrington. Upon his death in 1815, she lived with her brother and died at the age of 85.
Church life and business.
As the minister of Housatonic Township No. 1, Bidwell would have been expected to write two sermons each week. Members of the church would congregate in the morning before taking a short break for midday meal. Those close enough would travel back to their houses for dinner, however, most would bring along lunch pails. The second sermon began around 1:00 p.m. and stretched late into the afternoon. Reverend Bidwell's sermons often dealt with love or forgiveness, however his shorthand code is too complex to gain more than the basic feel of a sermon. The meetinghouse, badly constructed and only half finished when Adonijah arrived, was a poor place to hold service and town meetings. The space leaked and was bitterly cold in the wintertime. Eventually, it fell into an increasing state of disrepair and then burned down. All that remains are two foundation stones and the stone steps leading to the church. As the church slowly decayed, it is likely that Adonijah Bidwell would have held sermons in his own house, utilizing the 48 chairs listed in his death inventory. The Reverend had five punch bowls listed in this inventory. His large home may have accommodated travellers passing through Tyringham on the Boston-Albany Post Road which was located near the Meeting House.
Bidwell the Patriot.
As tensions between the colonies and Britain escalated, Reverend Bidwell took the side of the patriots. He also often centered his sermons around freedom, penning them in a cryptographic code to disguise the language to potential readers. In 1776, Adonijah Bidwell bore his "full proportion toward... the War" for Independence at age 62. He sold beef to the troops, gave up his salary for four years so they could be paid, and loaned the town an additional ₤60 to pay the soldiers. The debt was never repaid. Despite his fervent patriotism, Adonijah Bidwell hung several portraits of the king in his house. Messengers and soldiers under the king's command would have often stopped by frontier outposts, therefore, pictures were needed to suggest loyalty to the king. Following the American victory, Adonijah died in 1784 at age 68, leaving the farm and 1/3 of his possessions to his eldest son, Adonijah the Younger, as well as 1/3 of his worldly possessions to both Barnabas and widow Ruth.

Beverly Drive-In Theatre was constructed in 1948 as a cinema structure in Forrest County, Mississippi. The main screen measured 105 feet by 75 feet (32 meters by 23 meters), and the theatre contained a paved parking area for 500 cars. The back of the screen tower held a display of neon lights that denoted the "Beverly" logo with a moon and shooting stars. The original owners built their family home beneath the main screen.
In 2007, the Mississippi Heritage Trust listed the Beverly Drive-In as one of the ten most endangered historic places in Mississippi. The theatre was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 30, 2008.
The theatre operated from 1948 through 1987, and periodically for special events, into 2005, when Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to the screen and buildings. In 2005, it was the oldest drive-in theatre still operating in Mississippi.

Bothriopsis pulchra

Bothriopsis pulchra is a venomous pitviper species found in South America. The specific name is Latin, meaning "beautiful", in reference to the color pattern. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Description.
A small and moderately slender species, only two lengths are given by Campbell and Lamar (2004): 76.4 cm for a specimen from Colombia and 65.9 cm for the type of "Bothrops alticola", although the tail was incomplete.
The scalation includes 19-23 (usually 21) rows of keeled dorsal scales, 167-178/173-181 ventral scales in males/females and 63-64/53-60 subcaudal scales in males/females, with a varying number towards the end of the tail being divided. On the head there are 5-8 keeled intersupraocular scales, 7-9 (usually 7) supralabial scales, the second of which contacts the prelacunal, and 8-10 sublabial scales.
The color pattern consists of a greenish yellow or medium to dark green ground color that usually becomes more obscure towards the front of the body. The dorsal pattern is a series of 29 bands or transverse black spots that tend to fuse with each other towards the front part of the body. All of this is overlaid with a pattern of white dorsal keels. The belly is yellow with black mottling that usually increases down the body so that the tail is a uniform dark color. The end of the tail tends to be cream or pink with a rounded terminal spine. On the head, a cheek stripe is present that extends to the angle of the mouth. Above it is a parallel black stripe that runs from the supraoculars to the angle of the jaw. The labial scales are usually a very dark green color without any mottling. The iris is yellow and the tongue black.
Geographic range.
Found in South America on the eastern slopes of the Andes from south-central Colombia to southern Ecuador and northern Peru. The type locality given is "Quito" (Ecuador); a mistake according to Peters (1955).

Edinburgh Art Festival

The Edinburgh Art Festival is an annual visual arts festival, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, during August and coincides with the Edinburgh International and Fringe Festivals. The Art Festival was established in 2004, and receives public funding from Creative Scotland. The current Festival Director is Sorcha Carey. 
Historical background.
The Edinburgh International Festival began in 1947, and significant visual art exhibitions were included in the early years. Exhibitions included the French artists Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard in 1948; a retrospective of the three Scottish Colourists, Samuel Peploe, Francis Cadell and Leslie Hunter in 1949; and Rembrandt in 1950. Thereafter, there was acknowledgement from the Festival authorities that the visual arts needed to be more "emphatically represented" in the Festival itself, and a series of partnerships was forged between the Festival Society and the then Arts Council of Great Britain, the Royal Museum of Scotland, the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh University and the Royal Scottish Academy. With a few exceptions, these looked beyond the art of Scotland and contributed to a declared part of the Festival’s international aims. Not only did the exhibitions bring the works of foreign artists to Scotland, they cultivated an interest in Scotland amongst wealthy collectors and patrons from around the world.
From 1966, the visual arts existed outside the programme of the Edinburgh Festival, presented instead across a wide range of organisations, from the city's permanent galleries to artist-led initiatives. This left many galleries with no visible profile in August, a time when they are programming substantial exhibitions. 
A campaign by newspaper "Scotland on Sunday" in 2001 brought together a representative group of gallery directors, and the first visual art festival was piloted in 2004. Between 2005 and 2007 the organisation produced a Festival Guide, commissions, and collaborative projects, to celebrate and promote the exhibitions of Edinburgh museums and galleries in August, creating a collective and united marketing platform in which to showcase their artistic programmes. 
Since 2004 Edinburgh Art Festival has grown to be Scotland's largest annual visual arts festival, and now comprises over 45 exhibitions across more than 30 venues. The festival has also commissioned or co-commissioned major artworks around the city by artists including Martin Creed, Callum Innes, Richard Wright and Susan Philipsz.

Piłsudski's colonels

Piłsudski's colonels, or the colonels' regime (in Polish called simply "the colonels"), dominated the government of the Second Polish Republic from 1926 to 1939. In some contexts, the term refers primarily to the final period, 1935–39, following the death of their mentor and patron, Józef Piłsudski.
History.
Close allies of Józef Piłsudski, most of "the colonels" had been officers in the Polish Legions and Polish Military Organization ("POW"), and in the Polish Army (particularly from 1919–1920, during the Polish-Soviet War, prior to Piłsudski's 1923 resignation as Chief of the General Staff). They had held key, if not necessarily the highest, military ranks during Piłsudski's May 1926 Coup d'État.
Later they became important figures in Piłsudski's Sanation movement and ministers in several governments. After the "BBWR's" 1930 electoral victory, Piłsudski left most internal matters in the hands of his "colonels", while himself concentrating on military and foreign affairs.
The "colonels" included Józef Beck, Janusz Jędrzejewicz, Wacław Jędrzejewicz, Adam Koc, Leon Kozłowski, Ignacy Matuszewski, Bogusław Miedziński, Bronisław Pieracki, Aleksander Prystor, Adam Skwarczyński, Walery Sławek, and Kazimierz Świtalski.
The colonels' regime may be divided into three periods: 1926-1929; 1930–1935; and 1935-1939.
During the first period, after the May 1926 Coup, the colonels (and Sanation generally) consolidated their control over the government.
The second period, following the 1930 "Brest elections", saw the colonels' regime under Piłsudski's guidance, with power exercised by his allies and friends such as Walery Slawek and Aleksander Prystor (both of whom had known Piłsudski since 1905 and had served in his paramilitary units before World War I).
After Piłsudski's death (1935), the hardliner "colonels", led by Walery Sławek, lost influence to the Castle faction of Ignacy Mościcki and Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Nevertheless, the "colonels' regime" and Sanation still dominated the Polish government in 1935–39 until the German invasion of Poland. Some scholars draw a distinction between the "Piłsudski period" (1926–35) and the "colonels' period, proper" (1935–39).
From 1937 the colonels' new political front would be the Camp of National Unity ("OZON"). In that last period, the Polish government—a "dictatorship without a dictator"—in order to bolster its popular support, paradoxically adopted some of the nationalistic, anti-minority policies that had been opposed by Piłsudski and advocated by his most vocal adversaries, the National Democrats.

Sacred Way

The Sacred Way (, "Hierá Hodós"), in ancient Greece, was the road from Athens to Eleusis. It was so called because it was the route taken by a procession celebrating the Eleusinian Mysteries. The procession to Eleusis began at Kerameikos (the Athenian cemetery) on the 19th Boedromion.
In Greece today, the road from central Athens to Aegaleo and Chaidari (the old route to Eleusis) is called the Iera Odos after the ancient road.

Paul Gondjout

Paul Marie Indjendjet Gondjout (4 June 1912 – 1 July 1990) was a Gabonese politician and civil servant, and the father of Laure Gondjout, another prominent Gabonese politician. Gondjout was a member of the Mpongwe ethnic group, and served in the French colonial administration from 1928, and founded the "Cercle amical et mutualiste des évolués de Port-Gentil" in 1943. He was a delegate to the French Senate from 1949 to 1958, and founded the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG). In 1954, Léon M'ba joined the party and eventually overthrew Gondjout as leader.
In 1960, then President M'ba reshuffled the government without consulting Parliament. When Gondjout filed a motion of censure he was charged with attempting a coup d'état and sentenced to two years in prison. Following his release, M'ba appointed him to the largely symbolic post of President of the Economic Council, in part to silence the threat he represented.
Gondjout served as Minister of State during the abortive 1964 Gabon coup d'état but was acquitted of all charges during his subsequent trial. He lived outside public view from his 1966 acquittal to his death on 1 July 1990 and there is little record of his life during this period.
Early life and political career.
Gondjout was born on 4 June 1912, to a Mpongwe family. He had a younger brother named Edouard. The elder Gondjout began his service in the French colonial administration in 1928. In 1943 he founded the "Cercle amical et mutualiste des évolués de Port-Gentil" (roughly translated as Mutual Friends for the Evolution of Port-Gentil), an organization that enchouraged and utilised the talents of educated Gabonese. With the assistance of Mpongwe businesspeople, Gondjout was elected to the National Assembly of France on 24 July 1949 and re-elected on 18 May 1952—both times as an independent candidate—serving until the end of his term on 7 June 1958. On 18 December 1953, he became the father of Laure Gondjout. She would later become a prominent politician as would his son, Vincent de Paul Gondjout, and nephew, Georges Rawiri.
In April 1954, Gondjout and French forester Roland Bru formed the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG). Over the course of the following seven years, the party published a newspaper which caught the eye of the aspiring politician Léon M'ba, whom Gondjout had earlier helped to elect to the Gabonese council of government. The two formed an alliance supported by the Mpongwe business community, the wealthy coastal Fangs (like M'ba), and the French, which managed to overpower Jean-Hilaire Aubame and fellow members of the Union Démocratique et Sociale Gabonaise. Gondjout, the self-appointed secretary of the BDG, decreed M'ba to be the secretary-general. He and M'ba both believed that Gabon should not have full political independence, stating shortly before it was obtained:
M'ba overthrew Gondjout as head of the BDG and Goundjout aligned with Aubame on several issues, such as opposing M'ba's amount of power. Nonetheless, when Gabon gained its independence on 17 August 1960 Gondjout was named President of the National Assembly by the new President of Gabon, Leon M'ba. In November 1960 or 1961, Gondjout called for a constitutional amendment to allow him more executive power. When M'ba reshuffled his cabinet without consulting Parliament, Gondjout filed a motion of censure. He supposedly hoped to benefit from a balance of power modified to his own advantage, and to model Gabon after the Western democracies. M'ba, who did not share these ideas, reacted repressively.
On 16 November, under the pretext of a conspiracy, M'ba declared a state of emergency, ordering the internment of eight BDG opponents and the dissolution of the National Assembly the day after. Electors were asked to vote again on 12 February 1961. Gondjout himself was sentenced to two years in prison. He was imprisoned in a remote village under house arrest, where he was supplied, according to U.S. ambassador to Gabon, Charles Darlington, "with all the whisky and beer he drink and all the girls he want[ed". Unable to fulfill his position, it was given to Louis Bigmann. Upon Gondjout's release, M'ba appointed him to the mostly symbolic post of President of the Economic Council, in part to silence any threat to M'ba's power.
1964 Gabon coup d'état.
During the night of 17 February and the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 members of the Gabonese military, gendarmerie, and police, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Valére Essone, seized the presidential palace. They arrested President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann, French commanders Claude Haulin and Major Royer, several ministers, and President M'ba, who was dragged from his bed at gunpoint. On Radio Libreville, the military announced to the Gabonese people that a coup d'état had taken place, asked for technical assistance, and told the French not to interfere in this matter. M'ba was forced to broadcast a speech acknowledging his defeat, in which he said, "The D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits. It came to a boil."
No blood was shed during the event, and when the Gabonese people did not respond violently the military interpreted this as a sign of approval. Aubame was offered the presidency of the newly formed provisional government. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Gondjout. During the coup, he served as Minister of State. The coup's leaders were content at restoring security for the civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.
Second Lietenant Ndo Edou gave instructions to transfer M'ba to Ndjolé, Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed president and his captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambaréné. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. The new head of government contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of foreign nationals would be protected and to request against French military intervention. In Paris, President Charles de Gaulle decided against the plea. 
M'ba was one of France's most loyal African allies, and during a visit to France in 1961, declared, "all Gabonese have two fatherlands: France and Gabon." Moreover, under his regime, Europeans were particularly well treated. The French authorities therefore decided, in accordance with signed Franco-Gabon agreements, to restore the legitimate government. Intervention could not commence without a formal request to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was imprisoned, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. However, he remained unaccounted for; therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter confirming their intervention, that Yembit would later sign. Less than 24 hours later, French troops stationed in Dakar and Brazzaville landed in Libreville and restored M'ba to power. During the operation, a French soldier and 15 to 25 Gabonese died.
Post coup d'état.
Aubame and Gondjout fled Libreville, but were captured sometime before 20 February. In August a trial of the rebels and provisional government was opened in Lambaréné. A "state of precations" was imposed, which decreed that local government keep surveillance on suspected troublemakers and, if necessary, order curfew, and special permits were required to travel through the town. The trial was held in a school building overlooking the Ogooue River, which was near Albert Schweitzer's hospital. Space at the hearing was limited, so members of the public were disallowed from attending. Permits were required to attend the trial, and family members were restricted to one permit each. Press coverage was limited, and journalists were allowed only if they represented a high-profile news agency. In addition, there were restrictions on the defence of the accused.
During a trial which carried the death sentence as a maximum, the prosecution called 64 separate witnesses. Aubame claimed he had formed his provisional government in a constitutional manner; at the request of members of the "putschists". He argued that the French intervention was effectively an illegal act of interference; a belief shared by both Gondjout and the former education minister, Jean Mare Ekoh. On 9 September, without consulting M'ba, Leon Auge handed down a verdict acquitting both Ekoh and Gondjout of all charges.
Little is known of Goundjout's life between his 1966 acquittal and death on 1 July 1990, in Libreville. He is buried in Libreville near his wife Odette (d. 2006), a former fashion model. A secondary school has been established in his name.

Saint Quintian ("Quintianus, Quinctianus, Quintien") (died ca. 525) was a bishop of Rodez and a bishop of Clermont-Ferrand ("Arvernes") in the sixth century, and participated in the Councils of Agde (508) and Orleans (511).
Life.
Tradition makes him a native of Africa and a priest of Carthage who fled to France due to the persecutions of the Vandals. At the death of Saint Amantius ("Amans") in 487, Quintian succeeded him as bishop of Rodez. During the war between the Franks and the West Goths, he was a zealous supporter of Clovis I. To avoid the persecutions of the Arian Visigoths, he fled Rodez to proceeded to Auvergne, where he was hospitably received by Bishop Euphrasius ("Eufrèse"). King Theodoric I appointed Quinctianus successor to Sidonius Apollinaris (grandson of the famous Sidonius Apollinaris), Bishop of Clermont. On the death of the latter, Quinctianus succeeded to the See of Clermont, which he occupied until his death on November 13, 525 or 526
Veneration.
His feast is celebrated on November 13, except at Rodez, where it is kept on June 14. In the "Roman Martyrology" his name stands under both dates.

The 2009 Open Championship was the 138th Open Championship, held 16–19 July at the Ailsa Course of the Turnberry Resort, in Ayrshire, Scotland. Stewart Cink won his only major championship after a four-hole playoff with Tom Watson. Watson, age 59, had the chance to win his sixth Open and become the oldest major champion in history during regulation play, but was unable to par the final hole and tied with Cink.
It was the fourth Open Championship at Turnberry; the previous winners were Watson in 1977, Greg Norman in 1986, and Nick Price in 1994.

Round summaries.
First round.
"Thursday, 16 July 2009"
A calm and sunny Thursday meant good scoring conditions for the opening round of the 2009 championship. Miguel Ángel Jiménez took the overnight lead by firing a 6 under par 64. Past champions turned back the clock as 59-year-old five-time winner Tom Watson carded a bogey-free 65, and both 1989 champion Mark Calcavecchia (age 49) and 1998 champion Mark O'Meara (52) shot 67s. 2003 champion Ben Curtis also opened with a 65 to tie for second alongside Watson and Japan's Kenichi Kuboya, who was even par through 14 holes, but finished birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie. Last year's Cinderella story Greg Norman turned in a disappointing 77. Two-time defending champion Pádraig Harrington shot a quiet 69. Tiger Woods struggled off the tee and shot 71. Steve Stricker, Stewart Cink and Camilo Villegas, all looking for their first major championship, started strong with 66s. Notable players at -3 67: Calcavecchia, O'Meara, Retief Goosen, Jim Furyk, Mike Weir and Vijay Singh.
Second round.
"Friday, 17 July 2009"
The second round was windy with scattered showers, so it was much tougher than the first day. The scoring average was more than 2 strokes higher with just 7 sub-par rounds being posted on Friday compared to 50 on Thursday. The weather was at its worst during the morning, with the best rounds being the 68s of American Steve Marino, who would be joint leader at the end of the day, and England's Ross Fisher, who would be tied for 4th place. Retief Goosen shot an even par 70 and would also share 4th. Veteran Tom Watson continued his excellent performance. He struggled through the front nine, but holed long putts at the 16th and 18th, as he made three birdies on the back nine to tie Marino for the lead at 5 under par. At the age of 59, Watson looked to become the oldest winner of a major championship.
The cut fell at 144 (4 over par) with 73 players making the cut. Sixteen year-old Italian British Amateur Champion Matteo Manassero, playing with Watson, posted a level par second round 70, to go with his first round 71, to make the cut and all but secure the silver medal as the leading amateur. Among those to miss the cut was world number one and pre-tournament favorite Tiger Woods. Going out in the afternoon, he could only manage a four over par 74 after making 2 double bogeys on holes 10 and 13, and he would finish one shot outside the cut line at 145. It was the first time Woods had missed the cut in the Open, and only the second time he had missed the cut in any major as a professional, after the 2006 U.S. Open. Other notable players to miss the cut included Mike Weir (67–78=145), Ben Curtis (65–80=145), David Duval (71–76=147) and Geoff Ogilvy (75–78=153).
Amateurs: "Manassero (+1)", Gross (+9).
Third round.
"Saturday, 18 July 2009"
Tom Watson continued his good form with a one over par 71 to maintain a one stroke lead going into Sunday's final round. Australian Mathew Goggin was one of only five players to shoot under par in conditions similar to Friday, and ended the day just one stroke off the lead, tied for second with Ross Fisher. The best round of the day was a three under par 67, posted by Bryce Molder, who leapt into the top 10, having been tied for 53rd after round two.
Final round.
"Sunday, 19 July 2009"
Fisher, with birdies at each of the first two holes, took the outright lead from overnight leader Watson early on day four as Watson had 2 bogeys in 3 holes. Fisher dropped back with a quadruple bogey 8 on the 5th hole and was never in contention again. Lee Westwood eagled the 7th hole to move into the lead, which he held or shared for most of the round, but bogeys at three of the last 4 holes saw him fall one stroke behind clubhouse leader Cink, who rolled in a putt for birdie at the 18th to move to two-under, one clear of the previous year's leading amateur Chris Wood. Watson birdied the 17th to move into the clear lead at 3 under par. Needing a par four at the 18th to win, his approach shot took an unfortunate bounce and rolled off the back of the green. Watson was unable to get up and down and entered into a four-hole playoff with Cink for the Claret Jug.
Amateurs: Manassero (+2)

Playoff.
Watson and Cink had tied at 278 (–2) during regulation play and entered a playoff for the championship. Under the rules of the Open Championship, the playoff was played over four holes: numbers 5, 6, 17, and 18.
On the first playoff hole, both players found greenside bunkers, but while Watson was only able to make minimal progress towards the hole and made bogey, Cink splashed out to 6 feet and made his par. Both made par 3s on the second hole. On the third hole of the playoff, the par 5 17th, Watson's drive found a bad lie in heavy rough, and he was unable to reach the fairway with his next shot. Having reached the green in four, he then three-putted for a double bogey, while Cink hit the green in two and two putted for birdie. With a four stroke lead on the final hole, Cink hit his approach to five feet, and made birdie to triumph in the playoff by six strokes and win the Open Championship.

SS Rosehill

SS "Rosehill" was a 2788-tonne steel-hulled collier built in 1911 by S.P. Austin and Son of Sunderland under the name "Minster". "Rosehill" is also known as the "Penhill". She was torpedoed by "U-40" off Fowey on 23 September 1917 whilst en route from Cardiff to Devonport. She was taken under tow but sank in Whitsand Bay at 6:05 pm. She currently sits in 28 metres of water at with her bow to the north.
This wreck, which has been adopted by Totnes SAC under the 'adopt a wreck scheme', is often overlooked by divers, as the liberty ship and HMS "Scylla" are close by and in shallower water. The wreck is considerably broken up, and is hard to find on an echo sounder.

Marianne Breslauer

Marianne Breslauer (married surname Feilchenfeldt, 20 November 1909 – 7 February 2001) was a German photographer during the Weimar Republic.
Life.
Marianne was born in Berlin, the daughter of the architect Alfred Breslauer (1866–1954) and Dorothea Lessing (the daughter of art historian Julius Lessing). She took lessons in photography in Berlin from 1927 to 1929, and became an admirer firstly of the then well-known portrait photographer Frieda Riess and later of the Hungarian André Kertész, although she saw her future as a photographic reporter.
In 1929 she travelled to Paris, where she briefly became a pupil of Man Ray. A year later she started work for the Ullstein photo studio in Berlin, headed up by Elsbeth Heddenhausen, where she mastered the skills of developing photos in the dark-room. Until 1934 her photos were published in many leading magazines such as the "Frankfurter Illustrierten", "Der Querschnitt", "Die Dame", "Zürcher Illustrierten" and "Das Magazin".
Marianne was a close friend of the Swiss photographer Annemarie Schwarzenbach, whom she met through Ruth Landshoff and whom she photographed many times. She described Annemarie (who died at the young age of 34) as: "Neither a woman nor a man, but an angel, an archangel". In 1933 they travelled together to the Pyrenees to carry out a photographic assignment for the Berlin photographic agency Academia. This led to Marianne's confrontation with the anti-Semitic practices then coming into play in Germany. Her employers wanted her to publish her photos under a pseudonym, to hide the fact that she was Jewish. She refused to do so and left Germany. However her photo "Schoolgirls" won the "Photo of the Year" award at the "Salon international d'art photographique" in Paris in 1934.
She emigrated in 1936 to Amsterdam where she married the art dealer Walter Feilchenfeldt—he had previously left Germany after seeing Nazis break up an auction of modern art. Her first child, Walter, was born here. Family life and work as an art dealer hindered her work in photography, which she gave up to concentrate on her other activities. In 1939 the family fled to Zurich where her second son, Konrad, was born.
After the war, in 1948, the couple set up an art business specializing in French paintings and 19th-century art. When her husband died in 1953 she took over the business, which she ran with her son Walter from 1966 to 1990. She died in Zollikon, near Zurich.

Bavarian Pts 3/4

The Bavarian Pts 3/4 steam locomotives of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") were employed on the steam 'tramway' between Altötting and Neuötting. A total of four machines were built, nos. 1101, 1102 and 1103 in 1906 and no. 1104 not until the retirement of no. 1102 in 1922. They had a covered driving gear, a high boiler with water tanks located beneath it, gangways and a railing for the running plate. The engines carried of water and of coal on board.
After the foundation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn the remaining three locomotives were taken over and grouped into DRG Class 99.13. They were given the numbers "99 131 - 99 133". The locos were only used as reserve engines after the closure of the route in 1930 and retired in 1931. Number 99 133 (ex no. 1104, factory no. 7986), however, found a new job on the Wallersdorf – Münchshöfen branch line where it worked from 1938 to the closure of the line in 1949. It was then scrapped.

Boyd Cypert

Alfred Boyd Cypert (August 8, 1889 – January 9, 1973) was a professional baseball player, lawyer, Democratic Party politician and business manager. Cypert was born in Little Rock, Arkansas and attended the University of Arkansas where he played baseball and football for the Razorbacks. He enrolled in Harvard Law School school in 1912 and graduated in 1913. In 1914, he played one game with the Major League Baseball (MLB) Cleveland Naps. After his baseball career was over, Cypert served as the district attorney in Little Rock and in 1931 ran an unsuccessful bid for Arkansas Attorney General against four-term incumbent Hal Norwood. Later in his life, Cypert served as the business manager of the University of Arkansas' athletic department.
Early life and baseball career.
Alfred Boyd Cypert was born on August 8, 1889 in Little Rock, Arkansas to Thomas and Bessie Cypert of Arkansas and Tennessee, respectively. In 1900, Thomas Cypert was working as a grocery store clerk in Little Rock. By 1910, Thomas Cypert found work as a real estate agent. Boyd Cypert had one sibling, his brother Thomas Cypert, Jr. In 1910, Boyd Cypert enrolled at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas. While at school, he played third base for the Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team. He also was the quarterback for the Arkansas Razorbacks football for three years (1910–12). 
In 1912, Cypert enrolled at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1913. Cypert signed a professional baseball contract in 1913. He played his first and only professional game on June 27, 1914 as a member of the Major League Baseball (MLB) Cleveland Naps. In that game, he struck out once in one at-bat. Defensively, Cypert played third base. During World War I, Cypert served in the United States Army and later received an honorable discharge. In 1921, Cypret was a pitcher for the Arkansas Razorbacks alumni baseball team. 
Law and political career.
By 1920, Cypert worked as a general practice lawyer in Little Rock, Arkansas. In late-January 1922, Cypert was nominated for the position of district attorney in Little Rock. However, it was not until 1926 when Cypert was elected Arkansas Sixth Judicial District Attorney. His constituency covered Pulaski and Perry County, Arkansas. His deputy district attorney was Carl Edward Bailey, who would later go-on to be the Governor of Arkansas. In 1928, Cypert prosecuted Charles Smith, the president of Advancement of Atheism, on blasphemy charges after he was distributing pamphlets which read: "Evolution is true; the Bible is a lie; and God is a ghost". 
In November 1928, after the State of Arkansas passed a law banning the teaching of evolution, Cypert stated that he was not going to hunt down offenders, instead that he was going to enforce the law when asked to do so. In 1929, Cypert prosecuted Reece A. Claude, the state railroad commissioner, on bribery charges after investigating a bill in the Arkansas Legislature which Claude allegedly attempted to pay state officials to pass. In 1931, Cypert ran for Arkansas Attorney General against Hal Norwood, who previously held the office. Cypert eventually lost the race. He was succeeded at his position of Arkansas Sixth Judicial District Attorney by Carl Edward Bailey. 
Later life.
By 1930, Cypert was living in Little Rock, Arkansas with his wife, Blanch Cypert and their daughter, Belly. Boyd Cypert was hired as the University of Arkansas' business manager in 1934. In 1936, Cypert considered running for Arkansas Attorney General again. He died on January 9, 1973 at the age of 83 in Washington, D.C.

Richard Langley (b. probably at Grimthorpe, Yorkshire, England, date unknown; executed at York, 1 December 1586) was an English Roman Catholic layman, condemned for sheltering Catholic priests. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929.
Life.
From his father, Richard Langley, of Rathorpe Hall, Walton, he probably inherited Rathorpe, but for the greater part of his life continued to reside on his estate at Ousethorpe, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. His mother was Joan Beaumont of Mirfield. He married Agnes, daughter of Richard Hansby, New Malton, by whom he had one son, Christopher (b. 1565), and four daughters.
During the Elizabethan period Langley assisted the Catholic clergy; his house was offered as an asylum to priests. He constructed a subterranean retreat, perhaps beneath the Grimthorpe dwelling, which afforded them sanctuary. This refuge was betrayed to the President of the North, and on 28 October 1586, a strong band of military was despatched, several justices and Anglican ministers ojoining them, to make a domiciliary visitation of the Grimthorpe and Ousethorpe houses. Two priests were found in hiding at the former; at the latter Langley himself was seized. All three were carried to York, committed to prison, and subsequently arraigned before the President of the North, the priests because of their office and Langley for harbouring them.
During the investigation Langley would not take the oath of the queen's ecclesiastical supremacy, nor ingratiate himself with the lord president or Privy Council. The first jury which had first been empaneled to decide upon the case was discharged and replaced by another. Langley was condemned to death, without any evidence being adduced to establish the fact that he had knowingly sheltered seminary priests; and he was hanged, drawn and quartered at York. His remains were refused an honourable burial.

Pimicikamak government

Pimicikamak is an indigenous people in Canada. Pimicikamak is related to, but constitutionally, legally, historically and administratively distinct from, the Cross Lake First Nation which is a statutory creation that provides services on behalf of the Canadian Government. Pimicikamak government is based on self-determination and has a unique form.
Traditional government.
A modern Pimicikamak leader is quoted as saying: "Our ancestors governed themselves in our territory since time immemorial. Pimicikamak did not have rulers. It had leaders. Leadership was based on consensus and especially upon respect that was earned." Oral history told by Pimicikamak elders says that traditional government under customary law (Pimicikamāk okimākānak) was consensual, like other Cree governments. Customary law is well-recognized in the jurisprudence of the U.S., U.K. and Canada. Pimicikamak leaders were respected persons, possibly of the Midewiwin society. "A leader held his position as long as he had the respect of the people." As well, oral history says that Elders (the Council of Fire) and women played distinct roles in governance.
Original constitution.
Like other indigenous peoples in Turtle Island, Pimicikamak was constituted as a self-governing people under spiritual as well as temporal laws. These were passed down orally through stories, ceremonies and traditions that formed part of a culture that enabled Pimicikamak's ancestors to survive as a people in a harsh environment for thousands of years. Many stories say that the elders had a role in speaking of the law and the women had a role in organizing Pimicikamak society. Both came into play at summer gatherings. The Pimicikamak constitution derives from those times. It rests upon custom and is largely uncodified, characteristics it shares with the government of the United Kingdom. It has since evolved into a modern customary form.
Treaty 5.
On September 24, 1875, Tepastenam and two others signed Treaty 5 with the British Crown at Norway House on behalf of Pimicikamak. It had the effect of amending and partly codifying Pimicikamak's customary constitution and laws. The official written text of the Treaty implicitly depends upon the continuance of Pimicikamak self-government. It appears that, until the 1990s, no other part of Pimicikamak law was codified.
Modern constitutional changes.
"Pimicikamak’s traditional government is quite new, and yet it is also ancient." Beginning in 1996, parts of the Pimicikamak traditional constitution were updated and codified in written laws in English. They are based upon self-determination, the inherent right of self-government, the Rule of Law and updated traditional principles of democracy and accountability. They deal with making laws in writing, defining who is a Pimicikamak citizen and electing an Executive Council. Pimicikamak government is an example of direct democracy. Modern written Pimicikamak customary law is subject to acceptance by consensus of a general assembly of the Pimicikamak public. The roles of the Secretary to the Councils as keeper of customary laws and as the interface between the oral Cree traditional government and the written English world it faces may have arisen in the 1990s.
Councils.
Pimicikamak's four councils derive from its traditional form of governance by the elders and women. Each council is elected by its own constituency under its own rules and functions in its own roles by consensus. National policy is established by consensus of the Four Councils (itself a single entity composed of the members of all four councils). The councils are subject to Pimicikamak law. Pimicikamak law requires the Executive Council to give effect to national policy. Because the traditional councils can call an Executive Council election at any time, and its members are the Band Council members "ex officio", the Band Council tends to regard Pimicikamak national policy as persuasive.
Canadian government relations.
The government of Canada has not acknowledged Pimicikamak's customary government in modern times. Its policy is that self-government is an inherent right of aboriginal peoples in Canada and that this right is recognized and affirmed by the Constitution of Canada. "The federal government supports the concept of self-government being exercised by Aboriginal nations or other larger groupings of Aboriginal people." but does not accept that an aboriginal people may exercise this right without first negotiating it. Negotiation and legislation of self-government can result in domestic, dependent status similar to that of Indian nations in the United States of America, whose governments are defined by Act of Congress. Canada has not generally accepted Pimicikamak's policy of exercising its inherent right.
The government of Canada prefers to deal with Cross Lake First Nation, a domestic, dependent, municipal form of government established by Act of Parliament. Under this federal legislation and the terms of various agreements, the Band Council acts as the agent of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in delivering programs to Indians on reserve.
Since 1999, several Band Councils have taken and held office pursuant to the "Pimicikamak Election Law, 1999" instead of the federal legislation.
Manitoba government relations.
The government of Manitoba has a respectful relationship with the Pimicikamak government. In 2002, the Manitoba Minister of Northern and Aboriginal Affairs, the late Honorable Oscar Lathlin, set a precedent by formally addressing the Pimicikamak National Assembly. Premier Gary Doer has acknowledged Pimicikamak's government and traditional councils and formally met with its traditional chiefs.

Johann George Pfaltzgraff

Johann George Pfaltzgraff or Pfaltzgraf (May 5, 1808 – January 7, 1873) was a German-American potter and businessman. He is recognized as the first potter in the Pfaltzgraff family of potters in the United States. Pfaltzgraff Pottery Co. is known as the oldest pottery company in the USA. Lifetime Brands purchased the business in 2005. 
Born in Frielendorf, Germany, he moved to Foustown in York County, Pennsylvania, United States in 1833. He arrived with his wife Hedwig Eleonore (Elenora) Bramer right after they were married on May 27, 1833 in Frielendorf. Elenora was a commoner by German standards while Johann came from a family of great distinction and the upper class, as his family owned a pottery company. The marriage was frowned upon by his family in Germany, so Johann decided that a move to the United States was in the best interests of himself and Elenora. Johann and Elenora had ten children: John Bramer, George Bramer, Elizabeth, Emma, Annie, Sarah, Lydia, Cornelius, Henry, and Isaac.
After they settled in to the Foustown community, Johann began his new life as a farmer. He also started his trade that he mastered while in Germany by designing and creating his own pottery. He almost immediately began making stoneware from clay that he would purchase from Ohio. He also used the local lands in the Foustown area to gather his own clays as this region of Pennsylvania is rich in clays. Later, at least three of his sons learned the trade from him. There were: John Bramer, George Bramer, and Cornelius. The oldest pieces known to exist from the family are from John Bramer Pfaltzgraff. And every one of his pieces were unique, in that he never created a duplicate piece of pottery.1
Johann George died January 7, 1873. He is buried in a private cemetery across the street from the West Manchester Mall at 1881 Loucks Rd, York, Pennsylvania. Elenora died on January 8, 1896 and is buried in the same cemetery. Other Pfaltzgraff family members are buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery in York.

<doc id="18811719" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18811719" title="Telencephalization">
Telencephalization

Telencephalization is the process by which the brain, during very early stages of development, begins to be regulated by the more complex processes of the forebrain (mainly the telencephalon) rather than the more basic, or primitive neural centers as is observed in early development of the neural tube This intricate phenomenon is initiated by the asymmetrical division of progenitor cells, which not only gives rise to neuronal cells of the central nervous system, but also to glial cells [2.
Development Of Cerebral Cortex.
On the twenty-first day after conception for the human embryo, the neural tube develops, which ultimately becomes the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Throughout a period of a few short days, the neural tube becomes closed off and three chambers develop towards the anterior portion of the neural tube . These chambers are known as the ventricles, and the tissue that surrounds them constitutes the three major sections of the brain: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The telencephalon resides in the forebrain.
In development from the neural tube to the brain, which weighs approx. three pounds and contains billions of neurons, the cerebral cortex forms from the inside out. This means that the first progenitor cells to be produced travel a little distance and makes the first, or deepest, layer. The following cells that are produced must pass through each layer that was made before it, until all six layers of the cerebral cortex are fully realized. 
Symmetrical And Asymmetrical Division Of The Ventricular Zone.
Progenitor cells inhabit an area outside of the early neural tube called the ventricular zone. Progenitor cells divide during a phase called symmetrical division. These new cells can then move to an area termed the subventricular zone, where they continue to divide. After a period of approx. seven weeks or so for human development, the progenitor cells trigger a new form of division called asymmetrical division Like the name suggests, this division results in not only a duplicate progenitor cell, but also a neuronal precursor cell [2. Radial glia, which play an integral role in the migration of neuronal precursor cells during cerebral cortex development, are the first brain cells to be produced through asymmetrical division The cell bodies of radial glia stay in close proximity to the wall of the neural tube within the ventricular and subventricular zones, but they extend processes outward and connect to the pia mater, the innermost layer of the meninges (a group of protective tissues that surround the brain). As the cerebral cortex becomes thicker, the fibers of radial glia extend and preserve their connections with the pia mater [2. The job of these radial glia are to provide guidance for neurons migrating throughout the developing brain.
Asymmetrical division goes on for approx. three months during human development An estimate of how many neurons the human brain possesses comes out to be about 100 billion neurons, so that means on any given day during this three month period of asymmetrical division, there are around one billion neurons traveling along these radial glia fibers throughout the cerebral cortex [2. For the first layer of the cerebral cortex, the migration of the neurons along the radial glia is extremely short and takes around a single day. For the neurons that reside in the sixth, or outermost layer, their migration takes almost two weeks. Cortical development ends when programmed cell death (apoptosis) is triggered in progenitor cells via activation of “killer genes”.
Why And How The Brain Gets Its Size.
Genetic Duplication could be an implicit factor in how the human cerebral cortexes are more advanced than early vertebrates Geneticists have discovered that genes can sometimes duplicate themselves, and if this duplication occurs in gametes (ova or sperm), then this new gene can be passed on to the offspring of an organism [2. This offspring will have the ‘old’ gene to perform the functions necessary for the survival of that species, but with this extra gene, if it becomes mutated, can be utilized to perform higher-level processes (if this gene aids in the survival of this species).
Where does this extremely large brain of a human come from? Rakic (2011) poses a very interesting theory on how this could arise. The division of progenitor cells during symmetrical division increased the ventricular zone of the brain A delay in the termination of symmetrical and asymmetrical divisions could result in the larger size of the human brain when compared to other species [2. This delay could be caused by mutations of the gene controlling the timing of brain development Also, the convoluted appearance of the brain (sulci and gyri) increase the surface area of the cerebral cortex, which allows for more complex circuitry of interconnected neurons within the brain [2.
The ventricular zone produces more neurons than are needed. Around 50 percent of neurons don’t find appropriate synaptic connections with other postsynaptic cells and don’t receiving a life-sustaining signal that is received from the postsynaptic cell, so these neurons die by apoptosis This process of producing more neurons than is needed might be seen as wasteful, but an evolutionary process deemed it necessary to produce this surplus of neurons, rather than producing just the right amount of each type of neuron [2.

Calendar.
The 2009 season included twelve rallies, which was three fewer than the 2008 season, because the FIA imposed a "Round Rotation" System in order to attract candidate rallies to have a chance to be a WRC event. Monte Carlo, Sweden, Mexico, Jordan, Turkey, Germany, New Zealand, France and Japan were dropped from the calendar for 2009, but will return at the 2010 WRC Season. Ireland, Norway, Cyprus, Portugal, Poland and Australia returned to the 2009 season.
The eight events also part of the Production World Rally Championship were Norway, Cyprus, Portugal, Argentina, Italy, Greece, Australia and Rally GB. The eight rallies also on the Junior World Rally Championship schedule were Ireland, Cyprus, Portugal, Argentina, Italy, Poland, Finland and Spain.
Teams and drivers.
For The 2009 season, the championship has two manufacturer teams (Citroën Total World Rally Team and BP Ford Abu Dhabi World Rally Team) and three "semi-factory" teams (Stobart VK M-Sport Ford, Munchi's Ford and the Citroën Junior Team) that will be eligible for the manufacturers' championship.
Suzuki and Subaru pulled out of the WRC at the end of the 2008 championship, both citing the economic downturn currently affecting the automotive industry for their withdrawal.

Bavarian Gts 4/4

The only Bavarian Class Gts 4/4 locomotive in the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") was built in 1909 for the meter gauge line between Eichstätt and Kinding. 
The four coupled axles were very close together, so that tight curves could be negotiated. The centre axles were installed with side play, which meant the connecting rod had to drive the fourth axle. The wheelbase was only 2.6 metres and, with the overall length of the locomotive being almost 8.5 metres, it had very long overhangs. The result was a relatively rough ride.
A striking feature was the very large size of the driver's cab. The locomotive frame was designed as a water tank, and on the steam dome was a safety valve protected by a housing. The engine carried 2.2 m³ of water and 1.2 tonnes of coal.
The locomotive was mainly used in rollbock services between Eichstätt and a quarry. After the formation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn it was taken over and grouped as DRG Class 99.15 with the number 99 151. The engine was retired in 1935, after the conversion of the route to standard gauge.

Frederick A. Schroeder

Frederick A. Schroeder (March 9, 1833 – December 1, 1899) was an American industrialist and politician of German descent. As mayor of Brooklyn—before the city's merger with New York—and New York state senator, Schroeder earned a reputation for his fight against the political machine of the Brooklyn ring and for more efficient city government.
Youth in Germany.
Frederick A. Schroeder was born in Trier, Germany. His father Michael Schroeder was a merchant who later worked as a surveyor. From 1841, Schroeder was a pupil of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Trier, one of Germany's oldest institutions of secondary education, from which Karl Marx had graduated in 1835. Schroeder's academic achievements, however, were poor. In 1848, he dropped out of the school. In the same year, Schroeder's mother, Salomé née Abel, died. One year later, Schroeder, together with his father and two sisters, left Trier and emigrated to the USA. Frederick A. Schroeder's oldest brother stayed in Germany, but joined the rest of the family a few years later. The decision of the Schroeder family to leave Germany was linked to the events of the revolution of 1848. Michael Schroeder seems to have sympathized with the democratic cause. The family arrived in the USA on May 10, 1849 and settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Economic success.
In 1867 the firm of Schroeder & Bon switched its business activities from the production of cigars to the importation of tobacco leafs. The firm—and Schroeder personally—are credited with the introduction of shade tobacco, then an important innovation.
When Isidore M. Bon retired from the firm in 1893, Schroeder's son, Edwin A. Schroeder (1859—1902) and his son in law, Frank M. Arguimbau became partners in the firm.
His success in the tobacco business enabled Schroeder to start other business projects. He played an important role in the development of Shelter Island and built his own summer residence there. In 1867, Schroeder was one of the founders of Germania Savings Bank. Schroeder remained president of the bank until his death.
Supreme Court Cases involving Schroeder & Bon.
The economic success of the firm of Schroeder & Bon is also indicated by the fact that they were involved in several high profile commercial cases which were decided by the US Supreme Court:
In 1894, the firm was the losing party in the Supreme Court case of "Erhardt v. Schroeder", 155 U.S. 124 (1894), which concerned the customs duties due on a shipment of tobacco.
In 1905, the Supreme Court decided the case of "Allen v. Arguimbau", 198 U.S. 149 (1905), which concerned issues of federal jurisdiction. Defendant Frank M. Arguimbau was sued in his capacity as surviving partner of the firm of Schroeder & Bon.
Political career.
In 1871 Schroeder was nominated by the Republican party for the office of comptroller of Brooklyn. He was elected and served for one year. During his term, Schroeder sought to improve the city's financial situation and fought against the "Brooklyn ring" a political machine ran by the "Boss" of the Democratic party, Hugh McLaughlin. Schroeder reportedly even took some corrupt officials to court and forced them to pay back public money they had put in their own pockets. Schroeder did not seek re-election, but ran for mayor in 1875. He was elected and used his term to continue the fight against corruption. During Schroeder's tenure, Ocean Parkway was opened and the first wire of Brooklyn Bridge was strung.
Schroeder was a member of the New York State Senate (3rd D.) in 1880 and 1881. During his time in the senate, Schroeder was instrumental in the creation of a new city charter for Brooklyn. The new charter strengthened the position of the mayor and replaced the three-headed commissions which had presided over the city departments with single heads of departments. Schroeder also sponsored legislation limiting the amount of debt that municipalities could take on.
When his term as senator expired, Schroeder retired from politics. There were several attempts by the Republican party to nominate him again for the posts of mayor of Brooklyn, governor of New York and mayor of Greater New York after the consolidation. However, Schroeder declined to run again, even though in 1896, Seth Low offered to forgo his own candidacy for the Citizens Union, should Schroeder be prepared to run against Robert Anderson Van Wyck for mayor of New York. Van Wyck was the candidate of Tammany Hall, a political machine which played a role in New York politics that was similar to (and even more important than) that of the Brooklyn ring against which Schroeder had fought as mayor of Brooklyn.
The exact reasons for Schroeder's unwillingness to seek another political office are not known. However, according to Schroeder's own statement, his refusal to accept the republican nomination for the post of governor was due to the pro-prohibition stance of components of the Republican Party in the state, which Schroeder felt was driving away German-American voters.
Death.
Schroeder died in 1899 in New York. The cause of his death was pneumonia which he had contracted at the funeral of his daughter Mary Jane (born 1866). His wife (Mary Jane Schroeder, née Rusher, 1830—1913) who he had married in 1854, his son Edwin and five more daughters (Leonora Mary, born 1857, Harriet Louise, born 1861, wife of Schroeder's business partner Frank N. Arguimbau, Alice, born 1872 and Frances, born 1874) survived him. Schroeder was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery. Among his honorary pall-bearers were his former business associate Isidore M. Bon, brewer H. B. Scharmann, civil war veteran and Brooklyn Union Gas (now part of KeySpan Corporation) president James Jourdan, and former general and Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy.
Schroeder's death was mourned even back in his native town of Trier.

Huerto Cerrado

Huerto Cerrado is a collection of short stories written by Peruvian author Alfredo Bryce Echenique. Published in 1968, it was Bryce's debut in the literary world and won him special mention in the Casa de las Américas Prize of that year. The stories form a basis for the development of his later novel, Un mundo para Julius, published in 1970.
The stories take the form of a bildungsroman and are written in a variety of styles and perspectives and follow the protagonist, Manolo, in his journey of self discovery. Each short story shows Manolo in a different stage of his life and reflects the social and historical context of Peruvian society in the 1960s.
Manolo begins his journey in Italy and returns to Peru in the opening story "Dos Indios".
The collection consists of the following short stories:
An unnamed narrator meets Manolo in Rome. They talk in a bar, and Manolo recalls an encounter with two indigenous men during his childhood in Peru. After their talk, Manolo resolves to return to Peru.
A 13-year-old Manolo accompanies his father on a business trip to Paracas, a luxury resort south of Lima. They meet Jimmy, one of Manolo's classmates, whose higher social station allows him to treat the law and societal norms with contempt.
Manolo and his classmates go on a school cycling trip into the Andes, but Manolo fails to keep up with the other boys. Determined to struggle on, Manolo has a moment of self-realisation in the enormity of the mountain landscape.
Manolo is now 14, and he sells his bike (the same one as in "El camino es así") to Miguel, a gardener of mixed/indigenous descent with whom Manolo used to play football. He then buys himself a brown corduroy jacket with the proceeds. This story explores Manolo's increasing awareness of self-image and his place in the racial hierarchy of Peruvian society.
Around 15 years old, Manolo has passed all of his exams, which leaves him free for the Christmas holidays. However, this gives him a lot of thinking time, and he finds himself increasingly uncomfortable with and detached from the society around him. Of particular interest in this story are his attitudes towards women, as he takes solitary walks and sees how women are treated in a machista society, and feels his impotence to protect them.
This story takes the form of extracts from Manolo's diary, which chronicles his summer romance with Cecilia, a girl he met at the local swimming pool. Manolo learns about the concept of 'playing by the rules' and the difficulties of communication in human relationships. Manolo and Cecilia also appear in "Un Mundo Para Julius", Echenique's first novel.
Back in his boys' school after his summer of love with Cecilia, Manolo takes the separation badly. His English teacher, Mr Davenhock, puts his suffering into perspective by telling him about his German girlfriend, from whom he was separated for ever by World War II. This common ground brings the two into a kind of friendship, in their shared isolation.
Manolo visits a brothel with some friends to lose his virginity, as a kind of right of passage into machista society. His encounter with a prostitute, la Nylon, and the characters patronising the brothel are described in grotesque detail. In this microcosm of Lima society, a "cholo" enters the brothel and proclaims himself to be the king. His expulsion from the premises reflects the social position of indigenous peoples in Peru at the time.
In this story, Manolo has entered university, and takes advantage of a gullible schoolgirl by telling her all the things that she wants to hear: that he has rich parents, a big house, drives a sports car etc. Manolo gets his way, but afterwards feels the uneasiness of relationships based on falsehoods.
One of the few stories to mention Manolo's mother, "La madre, el hijo y el pintor" follows Manolo talking to his mother while she gets ready for a cocktail party she has been invited to by a male friend. This takes place after her divorce from Manolo's father, and she decides to take her almost adult son to introduce him to her new friends. When they arrive, they find a table set for two and a man who seems less than pleased with an unexpected teenager at his dinner date.
After a visit to the cinema, Manolo and a friend head to a bar. On the way, a man is run down and killed by a tram. The pair do not join the crowd that gathers around the victim, and continue to the bar. There, they talk about philosophy, life, and the inevitability of death. Notably, Manolo decides not to drink beer, and instead orders a pisco, showing his rejection of shared routines and traditions.
The final story finds Manolo on the beach at Lima, acting very strangely. He picks up rocks and articles of rubbish, noting everything down in a notebook, and speaks in disjointed phrases and infinitives. There are no references to his age in this story, and it is left to the reader to decide: is this Manolo before he went to Rome, where he was able to get his mind together again? Or is this Manolo after his return to Peru, driven mad by the divided society he thought he could escape in Europe, but was compelled to go back to?

Communion table

A Communion table is used by many Protestant churches, particularly from Reformed, Baptist, Congregational, and non-denominational traditions, for the preparation of the Eucharist (or "Lord's Supper"). 
The use of a simple table instead of an altar reflects these churches' rejection of any suggestion of sacrifice in the Holy Communion: they believe that the Passion of Jesus Christ was a perfect sacrifice for sins made once for all (-10:4). 
The table may be very simple, adorned perhaps with only a linen cloth, or with an open Bible and a pair of candlesticks. Some Communion tables often bear the inscription "Do This in Remembrance of Me" from the Last Supper (, ), indicating the belief in Holy Communion being a memorial rather than a sacrifice. Such a table may be temporary, being moved into place when there is a Communion Service.

Isabella of Viseu

Isabella of Viseu (1459–1521) was a daughter of Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu and his wife and cousin Infanta Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu. She was a member of the House of Aviz and later, House of Braganza.
Family.
She was the sister of Manuel I of Portugal and Leonor of Viseu. Her maternal grandparents were Infante João of Portugal and his wife Isabella of Barcelos. Her paternal grandparents were Edward of Portugal and Leonor of Aragon.
Isabella's cousin was Isabella I of Castile, wife of Ferdinand II of Aragon and mother of the English queen, Catherine of Aragon.
Life.
Marriage.
She married Fernando II, Duke of Braganza, a marriage that would later end in tragedy. This was Fernando's second marriage, after the death of his first wife, Leonor de Menezes. Leonor had not borne any children, so Isabella needed to deliver a son.
Isabella and Fernando had four children:
Downfall.
Even at a young age, John II of Portugal was not popular among the peers of the kingdom since he was immune to external influence and appeared to despise intrigue. The nobles (including particularly Isabella's husband, the Duke of Braganza) were afraid of his future policies as king. Events proved them right.
After the official accession to the throne in 1481, John II took a series of measures to curtail the overgrown power of his aristocracy and to concentrate power on himself. Immediately, the nobles started to conspire; John II did nothing but observe. Letters of complaint and pleas to intervene were exchanged between the Duke of Braganza and Queen Isabella I of Castile. In 1483, this correspondence was intercepted by royal spies. The House of Braganza was outlawed, their lands confiscated and Isabella's husband executed in Évora.
The following year Isabella's father was murdered by King John himself because there was word of a new conspiracy that also involved Isabella's second cousin and her father's brother in law. Isabella's family would have felt safe because her sister Leonor was married to John II, but they weren't safe at all. Many other members of Isabella's family were murdered including her elder brother Diogo, Duke of Viseu.
Later Years.
In 1495, John died without surviving issue and Isabella's brother succeeded him as Manuel I of Portugal. At first, Leanor was made heiress but because she was Dowager Queen and had no surviving children, the post as heiress was passed to Isabella, who in turn passed it to her eldest son Jaime, who was heir from 1495 until 1498 when Manuel's son Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal was born.
Isabella died in 1521, she was 62 years of age at the Lisbon Convent of the Mother of God, her brother died later in the year, her sister Leonor died 4 years later. Out of their four children Jaime and Dinis survived to adulthood, Jaime later succeeded his father as Duke of Braganza.

1999 FA Charity Shield

The 1999 FA Charity Shield was the 77th FA Charity Shield, an annual English football match played between the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions. The teams involved were Manchester United, who had won both the Premier League and FA Cup as part of the Treble the previous season, and Arsenal, who finished runners-up in the league. Watched by a crowd of 70,185 at Wembley Stadium, Arsenal won the match 2–1.
This was Arsenal's 15th Charity Shield appearance and Manchester United's 19th. Leading up to the match, both clubs were embroiled in controversy: Manchester United withdrew from English football's primary cup competition, the FA Cup, in order to take part in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship; Arsenal were entangled in a transfer saga involving their own player, striker Nicolas Anelka, who vowed to never play for the club again and cited the English media as a reason for wanting to leave.
The match saw Brazilian midfielder Sylvinho made his debut for Arsenal, while Ukrainian defender Oleh Luzhny was named on the substitutes' bench. Manchester United's only 'debutant' was goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, who was signed as a replacement for Peter Schmeichel, returning for his second stint at the club after leaving in 1991 and making his fourth overall appearance for United. Midfielder Roy Keane was absent with an ankle injury, so Denis Irwin became the club's stand-in captain. Manchester United went ahead seven minutes before the end of the first half, when David Beckham's free-kick hit the underside of the crossbar and narrowly crossed the line before Dwight Yorke made sure. Arsenal were awarded a penalty in the second half, which Nwankwo Kanu converted. Kanu then set up Ray Parlour to score the winning goal in the 77th minute.
This result marked Manchester United's first defeat of 1999. It was the second consecutive year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described it as psychological boost to beat his opponents and felt it showed that his team were ready for the upcoming season. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson on the other hand believed the defeat highlighted his players needed more game time.
Background.
The FA Charity Shield was founded in 1908, as a contest between the top professional and amateur teams of each season. In 1921, it was played between the Football League champions and FA Cup winners for the first time; the formation of a new top-tier division, the Premier League in 1992, meant it displaced the Football League spot. Wembley Stadium acted as the host of the Shield.
Manchester United qualified for the 1999 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1998–99 FA Premier League. The team overcame close competition from Arsenal to win their fifth league title in seven years. In the 1999 FA Cup Final, Manchester United beat Newcastle United by two goals to nil and completed the domestic double. The team later went on to win the UEFA Champions League after defeating Bayern Munich in the season's final and became the first English team to acclaim a treble of trophies in one season. Given United won both domestic honours, the other Charity Shield place went to league runners-up Arsenal. United appeared in 18 previous Shields, winning 10 outright (1908, 1911, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1983, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997), sharing four (1965, 1967, 1977, 1990) and losing four (1948, 1963, 1985, 1998). In contrast, Arsenal won eight previous Shields (1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1948, 1953, 1998), shared one with Tottenham Hotspur in 1991 and lost five (1935, 1936, 1979, 1989, 1993).
The last meeting between the teams was in the Premier League at Old Trafford on 17 February 1999. A goal scored by Andy Cole cancelled out Nicolas Anelka's opener for Arsenal; the match ended 1–1 after both teams spurred chances to win. In the close season Anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for Arsenal again. He cited the media in England as a reason for wanting to leave the club: "The one thing I can tell you is that I can't stand the English Press, who cause me enormous problems on a personal level," but it was implied that his "gold-digging brothers" wanted Anelka to move abroad to make more money – they served as his agents.
In June 1999, United accepted an offer from The Football Association (FA) to withdraw from the FA Cup in order to participate in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, staged in Brazil. It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a "shabby way". Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that we have to go to Brazil. They could tell us quite clearly: 'Do not bother about the World Cup bid, leave that to us. It should not be Manchester United's responsibility.'"
Pre-match.
Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger revealed before the Charity Shield game that he was not overly concerned with Anelka leaving, rather the injuries that were depleting his squad: "I cannot forget that it was because of a poor start to last season that we lost the championship to Manchester United." He refused to categorise the match as a "friendly" much like it is traditionally viewed as: "There is a trophy and medals at stake. We won it last season and our players want to win it again." Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson described the 3–0 defeat in the previous season's Shield as a "humiliation", before discussing how it made the team prepare for the challenges ahead: "I have reminded the players how hard it is to lose when you are playing for United these days – it makes so many other people happy." Indeed, United only lost five matches of the whole of last season, with their last defeat coming at home to Middlesbrough in December 1998.
Match.
Team selection.
Both teams were without several first team players because of injury problems. Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane was absent, which meant defender Denis Irwin took responsibility as the team captain. Ryan Giggs was also ruled out of the game, though his injury was unspecified. Forwards Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke started upfront for United, in a 4–4–2 formation where David Beckham and Jordi Cruyff acted as the two wide midfield players. Goalkeeper Mark Bosnich started his first high-profile match for United, signed as a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.
For Arsenal, defender Tony Adams was ruled out with injury, as was Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars, and goalkeeper David Seaman. Anelka did not partake, given his transfer to Real Madrid was on the verge of being completed. New signings Oleh Luzhny and Sylvinho were both named in the squad, but whereas Sylvinho started the game, Luzhny was selected as a substitute. Arsenal, like United, lined up in a 4–4–2 formation. Up front, Fredrik Ljungberg was paired with the club's only available recognised striker, Nwankwo Kanu.
Summary.
The severe heat meant Manchester United and Arsenal found it hard to find any rhythm early on. Sylvinho fashioned an early chance for Arsenal, though his shot was deflected over. Although midfield pair Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit did well to contain their opponents in the opening half hour, Arsenal's lack of pace and incisiveness upfront was evident – Ljungberg missed three chances before half-time. Midway through the first half, Beckham was booked by referee Graham Barber for dissent. Moments after Nicky Butt was involved in a brawl with Martin Keown, after the latter nearly caught Butt's face with his boot. Both players were booked for confronting each other, as was Vieira for getting involved. United performed better as the match went on and scored the opening goal. Beckham's 30-yard free-kick hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced out; Yorke headed the rebounded ball past goalkeeper Alex Manninger. Although replays suggested the goal was Beckham's as his free-kick crossed the goal line, it was given to Yorke. Arsenal responded for a short while, but missed "three half-chances".
Defender Jaap Stam, "nursing an Achilles injury all summer", was substituted in the second half for David May. Arsenal began the half the better of the two teams and Vieira believed he earnt his team a penalty in the 49th minute – it was turned down by Barber. The substitution of Sylvinho for Luis Boa Morte in the 64th minute allowed Ljungberg to play in a natural midfield role. Two minutes later, Arsenal were awarded a penalty. Vieira, chasing down the ball was adjudged to have his shirt tugged by Irwin in the 18-yard box. Kanu converted the penalty, sending Bosnich the wrong way. Yorke soon after mistimed his goal effort after being sent clear by Cole. Substitute Ole Gunnar Solskjær then put Cole through, only for Manninger to produce a one-handed save. Arsenal scored what proved to be the match winner in the 78th minute. A goal-kick by Bosnich was headed back into United's half by Vieira; Kanu controlled the ball "deftly" and set up Parlour, whose shot went into the net. Teddy Sheringham was brought on by Ferguson for Butt with nine minutes of normal time remaining, but with a fourth striker on the field, United were unable to score an equaliser. Luzhny later came on for Parlour, the final substitution of the match.

Post-match.
The result marked the first time that Manchester United had lost in the calendar year, ending a 33-match unbeaten run. Wenger believed the result showed that Arsenal were "ready for the season", albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke. He thought it was "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had". Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: "I hope everything will be finalised in the next couple of days. In any case, he is not coming back here, and although the contract is not signed yet, I hope it will be after his medical and that is the end of it." Kanu, who scored Arsenal's equaliser and set up the match winner, was pleased with his performance and relished the opportunity of establishing himself in the first team, after Anelka's departure.
Ferguson said the game showed that Manchester United needed more games to be ready, "particularly, in the second half" and felt travelling "half way across the world" for pre-season did not aid their preparation. In terms of the result, he said it was "about as significant" as it was last year. Bosnich's performance in goal received mixed reviews in the English press; "The Sun" questioned his positioning and said his kicking was "poor". The player himself assessed: "My kicking has been atrocious and, generally, my distribution from the back has to improve."

First round.
"Thursday, June 18, 2009<br>Friday, June 19, 2009"
Play began in the rain on Thursday morning, until play was suspended at 10:15 am, as several of the greens became unplayable with excessive water. Play was not restarted on Thursday, with the majority of players yet to tee off. Jeff Brehaut, through 10 holes, was one of four leading at 1-under par heading into Friday. Play was re-started on Friday morning and Mike Weir shot 64 (–6) to lead by two strokes at the end of the first round. Woods shot 74 (+4) with two double bogeys and three bogeys.
Second round.
"Friday, June 19, 2009<br>Saturday, June 20, 2009"
The round began at 5:00 pm on Friday afternoon and finished on Saturday afternoon. Because of the soft conditions caused by the heavy rain, many low scores were made during the second round. Ricky Barnes shot 65, and had a 36-hole record of 8-under par 132. Lucas Glover and Azuma Yano were also amongst the ones that shot very low scores. Woods shot 69 for 143 (+3), and Mickelson shot even par 70 to remain 1 under par at 139. The cut was at 144 (+4), the lowest at the U.S. Open since 2003, and was missed by major champions David Toms and Justin Leonard.

"Saturday, June 20, 2009<br>Sunday, June 21, 2009"
More heavy rain halted play at 6:55 pm on Saturday. The third round was resumed on Sunday at noon and completed in the late afternoon. Barnes and Glover both shot even par 70 to remain at the top of the leaderboard, while David Duval and Ross Fisher were five strokes back in a tie for third place. Weir struggled and fell back with a 74, Mickelson shot 69 to stay in contention, and Woods a 68 for 211 (+1), nine shots behind Barnes.
Final round.
"Sunday, June 21, 2009<br>Monday, June 22, 2009"
The final round began Sunday evening until play was suspended due to darkness, with leaders Barnes and Glover on the second hole. Play resumed Monday morning. Barnes, who had held the lead through the second and third rounds, faltered on the front nine on Monday morning, and bogeyed five of the first nine holes. He shot one over par on the back nine, but was never able to catch up with Glover, his playing partner for the final two rounds. Duval had a triple-bogey at the par-3 3rd, but rallied on the back nine with three straight birdies before bogeying 17 and missing a birdie putt at 18 to finish at 2 under par. Woods made a charge on the back nine with birdies on 13 and 14, but then bogeyed 15 and parred the rest to finish even par. Mickelson tied Glover for the lead after making an eagle at 13 after hitting a perfect second shot on the par 5, but proceeded to miss a short birdie putt on 14, three-putt for bogey on 15, miss another putt on 16, and made another bogey on 17 on his way to finishing two strokes behind Glover and tied for second place with Barnes and Duval. It was Mickelson's fifth runner-up finish at the U.S. Open, breaking the record of four by Sam Snead, Bobby Jones, Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus. (His sixth came four years later in 2013 at Merion.) Glover birdied 16 and parred the final two holes to seal the victory.
Amateurs: Taylor (+8), Weaver (+9), Stanley (+13).

Shannon Worrell

Shannon Worrell is a singer-songwriter based in Charlottesville, Virginia. Known for a series of critically acclaimed albums in the 1990s culminating with an appearance (as September 67) on the Lilith Fair tour and for collaborations with fellow Charlottesville-based musicians Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Worrell's acoustic songwriting has been described as "subtly orchestrated chamber pop" and "like a lean country cousin of the Throwing Muses."
Early career and "Three Wishes".
Worrell was born in Charlottesville to a prominent local media family; her father, Thomas E. Worrell, inherited a media network consisting of the Charlottesville Daily Progress and 28 other newspapers. She graduated from the University of Virginia in 1990 and stayed in Charlottesville, participating in the local music scene.
Worrell played in a band called Paris Match in the early part of the decade, but left to work as a solo artist sometime after 1991. She played in various locations around Charlottesville's Downtown Mall for several years; in particular, she jammed with Haines Fullerton (formerly of local band the Deal), Tim Reynolds, and Dave Matthews on several occasions. All three would subsequently perform on her solo recordings.
Worrell's first album, "Three Wishes", was released in 1994 on her own label, Super Duke Records. The album, co-produced by John Alagia, was recorded in a basement studio in Northern Virginia and comprises nine original songs in a mostly acoustic setting. Collaborators on the album included Tim Reynolds, the Dave Matthews Band's LeRoi Moore, and Matthews himself, who sang backing vocals on "Eleanor." Haines Fullerton participated as well, writing vocal arrangements for the album.
Monsoon and September 67.
Between 1995 and 1998, Worrell collaborated with a number of Charlottesville area musicians in various group settings. The first to form was a trio collaboration with Kristin Asbury and Lauren Hoffman initially called Monsoon. During this time period, the group appeared on the "Dear Charlottesville" compilation to support the local club scene.
Initially, all three members were contributors to Monsoon. However, Hoffman ultimately decided she wanted to go her own way and left the band, eventually signing a contract with Virgin Records. Worrell and Asbury continued as a duo under the name September 67. The group signed to The Enclave, an indie label affiliated with EMI, and released the album "Lucky Shoe" at the end of 1996. "Lucky Shoe" was produced by David Lowery of Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker and featured contributions from Bryan Harvey, John Alagia (who co-wrote "Little Lantern Face"), and the backing musicians from Sparklehorse.
The tour behind "Lucky Shoe" saw them supporting Wilco's "Being There" tour, and participating in Lilith Fair '97. During the Lilith Fair tour, the group recorded a live song called "Steve Malkmus is a Fucking Snob," which appeared as a non-album track on the EP "What's Wrong with Alice." The song earned the band some controversy and a mention in Rolling Stone.
When The Enclave was acquired by Virgin Records, Worrell's contract was not picked up, and the band made the decision to go their separate ways.
"The Moviegoer", hiatus, and new album.
Following the breakup of September 67, Worrell returned to the studio to record a follow up album. "The Moviegoer", released in April 2000 on her Super Duke label, saw her collaborating again with Bryan Harvey; the album features John Linnell on accordion and was produced by his wife, Karen Brown. Worrell took time off from music after the release of the album to raise her children and to work with Light House, a non-profit media education center.
At the end of 2007, Worrell began performing publicly again, playing supporting gigs for Charlottesville band Sons of Bill. In 2008, she entered the studio to record her first album in eight years, "The Honey Guide." The album was released in October 2008, and was a featured pick on the iTunes folk store.

Timeline of the Russia–Georgia war

The 2008 South Ossetia war began on August 7, 2008 and involves Georgia, Russian Federation, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Military conflict - timeline.
Tensions had been escalating through the year of 2008, but the countdown to the open hostilities began with a bombing of a Georgian police car near the Eredvi village east of Tskhinvali, with five policemen wounded by the blast. According to one source, the bombing happened on the 31st of July, another gives the date of August the 1st. A chain of reactions and counter-reactions followed.
Overview timeline.
Events prior to August 2008 are described in Georgian–Ossetian conflict.
Detailed timeline.
August 1 – August 6: buildup.
Beginning late on August 1, intense fighting began between Georgian troops and paramilitary soldiers of South Ossetia, causing the deaths of six people and injuring 21 others. The six killed were Ossetian militiamen, taken down by the high-caliber sniper rifles used for the first time by the Georgians. Each side accused the other of commencing the fighting. On August 3, the Russian government and the head of South Ossetia, Eduard Kokoity, instructed South Ossetians to begin evacuation into Russia, which resulted in twenty bus-loads of refugees leaving the region on the first day. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported 1,100 refugees arrived in North Ossetia by bus to escape the violence.
On August 4, it has been rumored that five battalions of the Russian 58th Army were moved to the vicinity of Roki Tunnel that links South Ossetia with North Ossetia. 
On 5 August, Russian ambassador-at-large Yuri Popov reiterated the Russian claim that the country would intervene in the event of military conflict. The Ambassador of South Ossetia to Moscow, Dmitry Medoyev, declared that volunteers were already arriving, primarily from North Ossetia, in the region of South Ossetia to offer help in the event of Georgian aggression.
On August 6, Georgia said it had lost an APC and that three Georgian peacekeepers had been wounded. Four people were killed that night and Georgia resumed shelling at daybreak. Residents once again began evacuating areas of South Ossetia and Georgia moved tanks, artillery, and troops to the border. The Georgian Interior Ministry reported that as many as ten Georgian soldiers had died in the clashes throughout August 7.
August 7: Georgian attacks of Tskhinvali.
According to articles at Russian media all of 58th Russian Army came to South Ossetia on August 7. Another article, in the official Russian military newspaper, reported an officer's words that at least some parts of 135th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the army had received orders to move in there.
According to "The New York Times" investigation Georgia provided intercepted cellphone records which according to Georgian side were recorded on August 7 morning and provide evidence that some parts of 135th Regiment of 58th Russian Army moved through the Roki tunnel that morning. The regiment is a supplier of Russian peacekeepers at the region. Western intelligence determined independently that two battalions of the 135th Regiment moved through the tunnel to South Ossetia either on the night of August 7 or the early morning of August 8, according to a senior American official. General Uvarov, the senior Russian official, said that as the Georgians began their attack, about 100 reserve peacekeepers from the 135th Regiment were put on alert and moved close to the tunnel. They were ordered through the tunnel to reinforce forces in Tskhinvali around dawn on August 8.
Authorities of breakaway South Ossetia said number of injured persons as a result of overnight and early morning intensive fire increased to eighteen on its side. And the Georgian Interior Ministry said two from the Georgian battalion of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces were injured after the Georgian villages of Eredvi, Prisi, Avnevi, Dvani and Nuli came under mortar fire late on August 6. The South Ossetian side reported that 18 persons, including one 88-year-old man and four women, were injured after the Ossetian villages of Khetagurov, Dmenisi, Sarabuki, and Ubiat, as well as the outskirts of the capital Tskhinvali, came under “massive shelling.” Initially the South Ossetian side said early on August 7, that six persons were injured. The South Ossetian side has also claimed that the shootout resumed in the region at about 10am local time on August 7. It said that the South Ossetian village of Ubiat in the Znauri district came under fire.
Around 2 p.m. on this day, Ossetian artillery fire resumed, targeting Georgian positions in the village of Avnevi in South Ossetia. The barrage continued for several hours. Two Georgian peacekeepers were killed, the first deaths among Georgians in South Ossetia since the 1990s, according to Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze.
The Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that "mercenaries and military hardware" are moving through the Roki Tunnel, which joins Russia's North Ossetia to South Ossetia, to support the separatists. South Ossetia claimed on Thursday afternoon that large numbers of Georgian troops were moving towards the breakaway republic's de facto border.
At 19:10 Georgian President Saakashvili, ordered a unilateral ceasefire. Saakashvili called for talks "in any format," reaffirmed the long-standing offer of full autonomy for South Ossetia, proposed that Russia should guarantee that solution, offered a general amnesty, and pleaded for international intercession to stop the hostilities. Georgia reiterated that it was prepared to engage in direct talks with the de facto government of South Ossetia without any preconditions.
Following Saakashvili’s address, according to Jamestown Foundation report , attacks on Georgian villages intensified. The village of Avnevi was almost completely destroyed, Tamarasheni and Prisi shelled, and the police station in Kurta, seat of the Sanakoyev administration, smashed by artillery fire. Civilians began fleeing the villages. South Ossetia denies any such late-night bombardment. OSCE monitors group in Tskhinvali did not record outgoing artillery fire from the South Ossetian side in the hours before the start of Georgian bombardment, and NATO officials attest to minor skirmishes but nothing that amounted to a provocation, according to Der Spiegel.
At 10:35 p.m. Georgian forces began another artillery assault on Tskhinvali. The Georgians used 27 rocket launchers, including 152-millimeter guns. Three brigades began the nighttime assault. The official reason given for this, according to the commander, Mamuka Kurashvili, was to respond to the above-mentioned attacks against Georgian villages. Kurashvili stated that the purpose of the operation was to restore constitutional order in the region. This caused an increased number of refugees to cross into Russia. Interfax quoted South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity as saying his forces were confronting Georgians in the outskirts of Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia; he noted that fierce fighting was under way. In a televised address, Georgian President Saakashvili has vowed to restore Tbilisi's control over what he called the "criminal regime" in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and reinforce order.
At 23:30 on August 7, according to one of the sources at Georgian Government, about 100 Russian armored vehicles and Russian troops invade Georgia, crossing the Roki Tunnel from Russia into Georgia
but before UN Georgia will claim that Russian forces have entered South Ossetia only on August 8 in 05:30 am. Another sources at Georgian Government agree with the later time.
Around 00:53 on August 8 (local time, 20:53 August 7 UTC), according to Russian sources, Georgian forces began shelling the route along which refugees were being moved from the city. As the day progressed, Russian media reported that at least fifteen civilians had been killed in Tskhinvali. The Georgian Army crossed the border of South Ossetia on the early hours of August 8 after overnight bombardment of Tskhinvali by heavy artillery (howitzers), 122 mm multiple-launch rocket systems "Grad", and large-caliber mortars. Tanks and APC supported by artillery launched a thrust towards Tskhinvali. Opposed by South Ossetian forces, Georgians advanced and by the end of August 8 controlled a significant portion of the city. At 04:45 (00:45 UTC), Georgian State Minister for Reintegration Temuri Yakobashvili announced that Tskhinvali was nearly surrounded, and that Georgia controlled two-thirds of South Ossetia's territory. The result of Georgian night-day offensive was more than 1,600 civilians killed according to South Ossetian sources, but only about 100 according to Georgian.
According to the President of North Ossetia–Alania, Taimuraz Mamsurov, a number of Sukhoi Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack aircraft of the Georgian Air Force attacked what he described to be a humanitarian aid convoy en route from Vladikavkaz. Mamsurov, who had accompanied the convoy and witnessed the attack, was unharmed. Earlier, he told the Interfax news agency that hundreds of armed volunteers from North Ossetia were heading to the Tskhinvali area.
Abkhazian leader Sergei Bagapsh said that volunteers from Abkhazia were on the way to help the South Ossetians.
It was later announced that an unspecified number of Abkhazian army units had advanced to the border of the arms limitation zone between Abkhazia and Georgia.
August 8: Russian involvement.
The Ambassador of Russia to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council at 1:15am (New York time) where an exchange of accounts was made with the ambassador for Georgia. After the meeting there was a stakeout outside of the Security Council for journalists. Churkin explained that he had brought a short statement to the Council asking for its approval. He reported that council members were willing to call on the parties to the conflict to stop the hostilities but that some of the members would not agree to the renunciation of the use of force, as Russia was asking. Churkin said he had warned the council over the past few days about a Georgian military buildup in South Ossetia and condemned Tbilisi's refusal to renounce the use of force to settle its dispute with its breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
On the morning of 8 August, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was in Beijing attending the 2008 Summer Olympics, condemned the Georgian government for aggression and breaking the Olympic truce, and that Russia would be compelled to retaliate. By 09:30, President Medvedev convened an emergency session of government officials to consider Russia’s options regarding the conflict.
Half an hour later, Georgian sources reported that three Russian Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft flew into the Georgian airspace and dropped two bombs close to a police station near the town of Kareli, which borders South Ossetia. The source also reported that the nearby city of Gori suffered a brief Russian air strike, with no casualties. Russian authorities rejected these reports, but a Daily Telegraph correspondent later reported that he saw unidentified jets near Gori, and the Georgian military described them as "Russian warplanes".
By 11:40, Saakashvili mobilised the Georgian reserve troops amid what he referred to as "a large-scale military aggression" by Russia and called for Russia to stop "bombardment of the Georgian towns". Contradicting a Georgian report, the Russian Ministry of Defence denied that a Russian fighter plane had been shot down above Georgian territory, calling it "informational provocation". A spokesman for the Russian forces in South Ossetia said that Georgian shells directly hit barracks in Tskhinvali, killing 12 Russian soldiers and wounding 30.
According to General Uvarov, the senior Russian official, the first Russian combat unit — the First Battalion of the 135th Regiment — did pass through the Roki Tunnel at 2:30 p.m. The battalion, he said, did not reach Tskhinvali until the next evening, having met heavy Georgian resistance. Georgia disputes that account, saying it was in heavy combat with Russian forces near the tunnel long before dawn.
Georgia reported that they offered a three-hour ceasefire starting 15:00 local time (11:00 UTC), to let civilians leave the besieged capital of Tskhinvali. However, at 10:29 UTC, Marat Kulakhmetov, commander of the Russian forces in the region, said that "these are further lies from the Georgian side. No corridor for civilians has been opened."
The Russian Ministry of Defence reported that the Georgians had killed at least 10 Russian soldiers and wounded 30 in the first shelling of their base at the city; later that number was revised to 13 killed and 70 wounded. A column of Russian tanks from the 58th Army began moving to Tskhinvali to help. Saakashvili said that the Russian column consisted of 150 tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and other equipment. A press video from 8 August showed Russian T-72 tanks, BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, and 152 mm 2S3 self-propelled howitzers moving south into the conflict zone.
Russian media reported that the Georgian army was falling back from Tskhinvali and Russian Su-24 bombers and Su-27 fighters were in complete control of the airspace above Tskhinvali. Kulakhmetov said that as a result of Georgian heavy bombardment, Tskhinvali is almost totally destroyed. Gas pipes, a hospital, and other objects of infrastructure were hit. According to France Press, at 12:00 UTC the National Security Council of Georgia (through a statement of Council Secretary Alexander Lomaia) declared that if messages about Russian tanks in South Ossetia are confirmed, then Georgia would declare war on Russia. Russian tanks entered Tskhinvali shortly after, and by nightfall Russian and South Ossetian forces controlled a large part of the city.
The Georgian Interior Ministry said that a Russian fighter dropped two bombs on the Vaziani Military Base, near Tbilisi. Russian fighters also bombed a military airfield in Marneuli, near Tbilisi. At least four people were killed and another five wounded in the air strike in Marneuli, while three Georgian soldiers were killed at Vaziani. According to the source in the Russian Ministry of Defense, "the warplanes attacked only military targets: military base in Gory' Vaziani and Marneuli airfields, where Su-25 and L-39 airplanes are based, and the radar station from Tbilisi". When asked why Russian warplanes entered Georgian airspace well before Russian government approved the involvement in Southern Ossetia conflict, the officer responded, "According to the orders from the higher command."
Saakashvili initially said that Georgia was pulling its 2,000-strong troop contingency from Iraq. The head of Georgia's Security Council, Kakha Lomaia, later clarified that only 1,000 troops were being redeployed, telling Reuters, "We have already communicated to our American friends that we are going to withdraw half our contingent of soldiers in Iraq within days because we are under Russian aggression." According to Georgia, the United States will provide the aircraft for transportation - a move that could risk U.S. involvement into the conflict; U.S. officials only said that all transportation options were being explored.
After the opening ceremonies in Beijing for the Olympics, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said to U.S. President George W. Bush that a real war had begun in Ossetia, to which Bush replied that no one wanted war, and Putin added that it is difficult to maintain peace in the Caucasus.
In New York a second emergency session of the United Nations Security Council was convened by the ambassador for Georgia where he detailed the "premeditated military intervention" following Russia's "well-calculated provocation". The Russian ambassador responded with news of the "treacherous attack on South Ossetia" by Georgian forces and reports of ethnic cleansing in the villages
Washington refused to support a Russian-backed resolution in the United Nations Security Council calling for an end to the fighting because of its opposition to a clause calling on all sides to "renounce the use of force". This persuaded Russia that Washington was backing Georgia's "right" to take military action.
August 9: Escalation.
Russian media reported heavy gunfire between Russian and Georgian troops continued through the night, and CNN stated that an airfield near Tbilisi was bombed in the early hours of the day.
Before morning Russian planes bombed the Senaki military base killing 13 Georgian soldiers and wounding another 13. The base itself was mostly destroyed.
At 5:00 AM, A Russian unit broke through the Georgian encirclement of the Russian peacekeepers and began evacuating wounded.
At 06:27 UTC, Reuters reported that two Russian fighters had bombed Georgian artillery encampments near Gori. The Georgian government reported that 60 civilians were killed when at least one bomb hit an apartment in Gori. According to the Russian military, three bombs hit an armament depot and the façade of one of the adjacent 5-storey apartment buildings suffered as a result exploding ammunition from the depot. At 07:41 UTC, Lenta.Ru reported that units of the 76th Airborne Division of the Russian Airborne Troops from Pskov had moved to Tskhinvali. According to Igor Konashenkov, commander of the Russian Ground Forces, they were transferred to strengthen Russian ground forces in the South Ossetian capital. It was confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Defence's press service that units of the Ivanovo-based 98th Guards Airborne Division of the Russian Airborne Troops and Spetsnaz from the Moscow-based 45th Detached Reconnaissance Regiment would be moved to the conflict area.
At 07:57 UTC, the Russian Ministry of Defence reported that its 58th Army had fully freed Tskhinvali of Georgian armed forces., and at 08:30 UTC, the Russian General Staff confirmed the loss of two jets: a Su-25 and a Tupolev Tu-22M; the latter was later claimed to be running aerial reconnaissance missions. The Georgian government claimed they had actually downed 10 Russian jets and captured 3 pilots. At 10:30 UTC, Russian paratroopers were deployed in South Ossetia. President Saakashvili called for a ceasefire in a speech. At 10:41 UTC, aerial attacks were carried out by Abkhazia in the eastern part of the Kodori Valley; the only part of Abkhazia which, effectively, was under Georgian control. At 11:25 UTC, Georgian President Saakashvili asked his country's parliament to announce a state of martial law in Georgia. The parliament approved the request, declaring martial law in Georgia for a duration of 15 days; David Bakradze, the Chairman of the Parliament of Georgia, said that Georgia was in a "de facto" state of war with Russia.
At around noon local time on August 9, Saakashvili said he proposed a ceasefire and the separation of the warring parties. Georgia's Security Council secretary Alexander Lomaia said Saakashvili's proposal meant that the Georgian troops would withdraw from Tskhinvali, the provincial capital of South Ossetia, and stop responding to Russian shelling. Russia's ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin said that Russia would start negotiations only if Georgian forces withdrew to the positions they held before the conflict began; the Russian Foreign Ministry added a requirement that Georgia should promise to never attempt to retake the territory. At 16:15 the Russian Defense Ministry said it had not received any ceasefire proposal from Georgia. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the only solution was for Georgian troops to leave the conflict zone.
A Russian armored column led by General Anatoly Khrulyov entering the city was ambushed by Georgian special forces. Russian Major Denis Vetchinov organized a defense, but was killed in the fighting. General Khrulyov himself was wounded, and Russian forces sustained heavy casualties in the fighting. The entire column was almost completely wiped out, and only five vehicles escaped the ambush. The Russians claimed that all of the Georgians were killed.
According to a source in the Georgian government, the Roki Tunnel used by Russians to bring in supplies and reinforcements was demolished. The Russian Ministry of Defense denied the report. Time Magazine reporter John Wendle later confirmed that the tunnel had not been destroyed. Lomaia reported that Russia had bombed the Black Sea port of Poti and had started to bomb civil and economic infrastructure. There were also reports by the Associated Press of Russian ships patrolling the waters off Poti, though Russia denied they were implementing a blockade.
Lenta.ru reported that all Russian TV channels had been banned from broadcasting in Georgia, with Georgia alleging that Russia was conducting an ongoing information war. Meanwhile, Russia cut off all air connections with Georgia. On the same day, the United Nations once again failed to reach consensus on how to word any request for a cessation of hostilities.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that the Russian Federation begins operation "to force the Georgian side to peace".
The U.S. embassy in Georgia organized an evacuation convoy to leave for Yerevan on August 10 and a second one scheduled for August 11 and invited American citizens in the region to join them, while it also issued a travel warning.
August 10: Georgia begins withdrawing from Tskhinvali.
Reuters reported that South Ossetian officials claimed that fighting on Tskhinvali's southern fringes had ended at about midnight; however, these reports could not be substantiated. Reuters further reported that the Russian commander of the 58th Army in South Ossetia, Lieutenant General Anatoly Khrulyov, was wounded by Georgian forces outside of Tskhinvali early Sunday morning.
Moscow Defense Brief reported that by the morning of August 10, the Georgians had captured almost all of Tskhinvali, forcing Russian and South Ossetian forces to retreat to the northern reaches of the city. However, the tide soon turned. Ossetian militia with the support of Russian forces took back several villages, and Georgian forces in several Georgian enclaves were eliminated. In the village of Zemo-Nikosi, Georgian forces stubbornly resisted a Russian armored attack, and managed to hold off the Russians for a period of time before being wiped out. The bulk of Georgian artillery was forced off positions from which it could shell Tskhinvali, including the key Prisi heights. Georgian forces began withdrawing from Tskhinvali. Georgian forces tried to push into Tskhinvali a third time, but were repelled by a very heavy Russian-led counterattack.
The Georgian Interior Ministry claimed that Russia had moved 6,000 soldiers into South Ossetia by land and another 4,000 into Abkhazia by sea in preparation to attack at dawn the next day. Vladimir Putin, after attending the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, flew to North Ossetia to oversee what he called a "humanitarian operation" and state that he believed it was now unlikely that South Ossetia could ever reintegrate within Georgia. He said the government was ready to earmark up to RUB10.1 billion (approximately US$425 million) for aid to the region. Putin's spokesperson gave assurances that the visit had no military component, and in the morning Putin left for Gorki outside Moscow to meet Russian president Medvedev.
There were conflicting reports as to the continuation of Georgian military actions. Georgia claimed that its forces were retreating from South Ossetia and the Foreign Ministry of Georgia announced that the government had declared a unilateral ceasefire. However, Russian troops refused to recognise a truce, claiming Georgian forces were not retreating, but merely regrouping. Georgia’s Internal Affairs Ministry spokesman, Shota Utiashvili, claimed that "Georgian troops have fully left South Ossetia", while according to Georgian Reintegration Minister Temur Yakobashvili, Georgian troops had pulled out of Tskhinvali and, according to her, Georgian "forces have relocated and assumed new positions." Russian peacekeeping spokesman Vladimir Ivanov, however, stated that "Georgia did not remove its forces from South Ossetia. Our observation posts have spotted Georgian law-enforcement units, as well as artillery and armoured vehicles."
Russia later acknowledged a withdrawal was in progress, with a spokesman noting, "Units of the Georgian armed forces have started withdrawing from Tskhinvali. The withdrawal has been spotted by the peacekeeping forces' intelligence."
Sergei Bagapsh, President of Abkhazia, said he had sent 1,000 troops to the Kodori gorge and announced the mobilisation of reservists to reinforce its positions. He warned Abkhazia was ready to "enforce order" and would go further if there was resistance from Georgia.
At around 3:20 p.m. UTC, Georgia said that they ordered a ceasefire, and offered to start talks with Russia over an end to hostilities in South Ossetia. Russia confirmed receiving the offer but said that "the Georgian side has not stopped military actions in South Ossetia, Georgian troops continued shelling." However, Russian and Georgian foreign ministers spoke over the phone. The conversation ended with the Georgian minister promising to find out more about whether Georgian forces were withdrawn from South Ossetia.
Later in the day, Georgia reported that Tbilisi International Airport was the target of a Russian air strike, just a few hours before the scheduled arrival of French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. The Russian Ministry of Defence dismissed the alleged bombing as "another disinformation" by Georgia. Georgian State Minister for Reintegration, Temur Iakobashvili also denied this, stating, "There was no attack on the airport in Tbilisi. It was a factory that produces combat airplanes."
The Russian Defence Ministry announced that the Russian Navy sunk a Georgian missile boat after two alleged attacks of such boats earlier that day. This was later confirmed by Russian Navy Commander Assistant Igor Dygalo. He said that four Georgian vessels were spotted sailing inside a 'security zone' established by the Russian Navy off Abkhazia. The Russian fleet retaliated with a barrage of naval gunfire. One patrol boat was sunk and the remaining three retreated in the direction of the Georgian port of Poti.
The ambassador for the United States convened an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council in which UN Under-Secretary-General B. Lynn Pascoe gave a briefing about the refugee situation and Edmond Mulet briefed about the situation relating to the mandate of UNOMIG.
Following statements by Georgia and the United States, the Russian ambassador said: "Unfortunately, I have to point out that the content of
the briefing by Mr. Pascoe shows that the Secretariat and its leadership have not been able to adopt an objective position showing a thorough grasp of the substance of this conflict, as should be expected from the leadership of such an authoritative international organisation". CNN reported that the Russian ambassador drew rebuke after making this comment.
The ambassador for the United States later added: "Foreign Minister Lavrov told United States Secretary of State Rice that the democratically elected President of Georgia — and I quote — 'must go'. I quote again: 'Saakashvili must go'. This is completely unacceptable and crosses the line." The Russian ambassador responded by saying "On Ambassador Khalilzad’s interesting reference to a confidential diplomatic telephone call between our Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Secretary of State, I must say at the outset that regime change is an American expression. We do not use such expressions."
According to Newsru, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin later denied this, and rather said that Saakashvili "cannot be considered as a partner" because "no decent person would talk to him". He said that if an agreement of not using military force is signed, "peace will be restored whatever the fate of Saakashvili will be". He said Condoleezza Rice "misinterpreted" their phone conversation.
A Turkish TV crew was attacked while heading into South Ossetia and taken to Vladikavkaz for interrogations. They were later released by Russian authorities.
August 11: Russian advances.
In the early hours of August 11, Russian sources reported that Tskhinvali was again under fire from Georgian artillery. South Ossetia government representative Irina Gagloeva stated the morning of August 11 that Georgia opened the irrigation canal, supposedly in an effort to flood the basements of Tskhinvali buildings with an intention to prevent civilians from hiding from bombings.
According to Georgian officials, large numbers of Russian ground forces had entered undisputed Georgian territory and were headed to Gori. Western officials again reiterated their fears that Russia intends to overthrow the Georgian government. Russia denied any intention of occupying Georgia, "We have enough territory to think of, we don't need Georgia." said Aleksei Pavlov, a Kremlin spokesman. The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia claims that Russia began "intensive combat" in Gori following prior air strikes. Georgian troops reportedly returned fire. The Russian Ministry of Defense did not confirm or deny the reports.
Russian forces moved into Senaki, which is inland from the Black Sea, and seized police stations in Zugdidi, just outside the southern fringe of Abkhazia. Abkhazian allies took control of the nearby village of Kurga, according to witnesses and Georgian officials. An Associated Press reporter saw Russian troops in control of government buildings in Zugdidi just miles from the frontier and Russian troops were reported in nearby Senaki.
During the early morning Moscow time, Russia declared itself ready to make peace with Georgia. UN officials confirmed Georgia was prepared to negotiate with Russia by withdrawing troops from South Ossetia and create a safe travel zone. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Russia is "ready to put an end to the war," but also accused the UN secretary-general's office of taking Georgia's side. The agreement was confirmed by UN Undersecretary-General for Political Affairs, B. Lynne Pascoe during a briefing to the Security Council.
The United Nations Security Council held a closed meeting on the issue at 5:30pm New York time.
Georgia declared it had received a Russian ultimatum that it must disarm troops near the breakaway province of Abkhazia or face Russian forces moving into Georgian-controlled territory. This demand was conveyed through UN military observers in the area. Russian assistant commander Alexander Novitskiy reported on the morning of August 11 that 9,000 Russian troops and 350 armoured vehicles had entered Abkhazia during the evening of August 10.
Later, Russian media reported that Russian Airborne Forces Commander lieutenant general Valeriy Evtukhovich arrived in Abkhazia.
Russian General Staff Second-in-Commander Anatoliy Nogovitsyn confirmed in the briefing at noon that Russian Army lost another two Su-25 jets. Also he confirmed 18 soldiers dead, 14 missing (whereabouts unknown).
Federal Security Service (FSB) Director Alexander Bortnikov reported that nine Georgian special services agents were arrested, and they "prepared for terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation". He said that all nine agents confessed to the allegations.
According to Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, 800 Georgian troops and 11 tons of cargo were moved from Iraq to Georgia by eight U.S. military transport flights. Early Georgian officials said that all moved Georgian troops will be sent to South Ossetia war conflict zone. Nogovitsyn also stated that Russia will take "adequate measures" in response to that, which would mean the increase of Russian troops in conflict zone. Prime minister Vladimir Putin criticised the United States for help in redeploying Georgian troops from Iraq.
North Ossetian government officials said that several foreign mercenaries arrived at Vladikavkaz hospital. Early at General Staff briefing Anatoly Nogovitsyn confirmed that there were black-skinned soldiers with non-Georgian passports among them; he did not specify their citizenship.
According to RIA Novosti, the earlier reports about
Russians not being allowed to leave Georgia were denied by the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs claims that it received such reports from over 360 stranded Russian citizens.
The Georgian Minister of Defense announced that the Georgian military base in Senaki, outside Abkhazia, was captured by Russian armoured vehicles. UN officials B. Lynn Pascoe and Edmond confirmed this in a UN security meeting and said that Russian airborne troops were not meeting any resistance while taking control of Georgia's Senaki army base. The Georgian Interior Minister stated that police stations in Zugdidi had also been seized, which was later confirmed also by AP. According to witnesses and Georgian officials, Abkhazians also took control of the nearby village of Kurga.
According to Georgian officials, the city of Gori— from the Georgian capital—has fallen to Russian forces. Russian troops destroyed an empty military base which Georgian soldiers had previously fled and then took position just outside of the town. The Russian defense ministry denied the information, claiming there were no Russian troops in Gori. Russia's version of events was confirmed by Reuters reporters James Kilner and Margarita Antidze, who said that there is no "trace of troops or military vehicles, it is absolutely deserted". The "Daily Telegraph" (UK) reported that it witnessed "Georgians in a full scale disorganised and panicked retreat from Gori". Georgian troops were falling back to defend the capital city of Tbilisi, following their retreat from Gori. Later local journalist from Gori said to Guardian that "Russian troops had occupied the main road on the edge of the city, but had not moved towards the centre" and Guardians journalist confirmed that city were bombed.
Since Gori is along Georgia's main highway, its alleged occupation by Russian forces would have cut Georgia's lines of communication and logistics in two. Secretary of the Georgian Security Council, Alexander Lomaia, said that the Georgian Army had been told to stand fast and hold the city of Mtskheta, from the capital. But note that several hours later, in the night of August 11 and August 12, reports of a wholesale Russian invasion or even an advance as far as Gori could not be confirmed by U.S. sources, based on on-the-ground intelligence. A U.S. defense official said he didn't see anything that supports that the Russians are in Gori and doesn't know why the Georgians were saying that. A U.S. military official told CNN that Russian attacks on Georgia – including radars and communication systems – have devastated the country's command and control system to the point where Georgian leaders may not have a clear idea of the situation on the ground.
The Assistant Commander of Russian peacekeepers Alexander Novitsky claims that during a reconnaissance mission the Russian Air Force shot down two Georgian helicopters at the air base of Senaki. The helicopters were identified as Mi-8 and Mi-24 belonging to the Georgian Air Force.
Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed sending of two companies of Chechnya based special battalions Vostok ("East") and Zapad ("West") to South Ossetia.
The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported that the United States was supplying Georgia with arms. According to the paper, the United States is hiring Russian-made freight planes belonging to UTI Worldwide Inc. to transport arms and ammunition to Georgia. The paper says the Pentagon is redirecting supplies to Tbilisi that were earmarked for Iraq.
According to "Russia Today" (RT): "The U.S. has begun evacuating the families of its diplomats from Georgia. They are being sent to Armenia as a precaution, according to the U.S. Embassy in the Armenian capital Yerevan. U.S. ambassador John Tefft and his team of diplomats will continue their work in Tbilisi."
Meanwhile Russian Defence Ministry said it has no plans to attack Tbilisi. "We do not have and have never had any plans to advance on Tbilisi," Interfax agency cites a source in Russian command. Russian troops left the Georgian military base at Senaki, which they took earlier this day.
August 12 - August 13: ceasefire.
Authorities in South Ossetia said that Georgian troops had shelled the road being used for evacuating people from the conflict zone, according to Russian Interfax news agency. According to Russia Today attacks continued in the South Ossetian region, despite claims from Georgia that it was imposing a ceasefire.
The Agence France-Presse reported that U.S. defense officials said they were unable to corroborate the Georgian claims that Russian troops had moved out of South Ossetia into Georgia proper, occupying the city of Gori while Georgian troops were retreating to the capital. "We don't see anything that supports they are in Gori", said a defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I don't know why the Georgians are saying that." The official also said there was no obvious buildup of Russian forces along the border that signaled an intention to invade.
Russia has deployed a ship off the coast of Poti and is reportedly enforcing a 50-mile exclusion zone around the port. Georgia also accused Russia of sending troops into Poti though Russia claimed they had only sent in a reconnaissance mission, which visited city only for a short amount of time.
The Foreign Minister of Italy, Franco Frattini, said he would consider deploying Italian soldiers to the region in the event that French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner recommends EU involvement after his mediation mission to Tbilisi and Moscow this week; however, Frattini stressed that Italy could not support the creation of a "European anti-Russian coalition" over the conflict. He also told ANSA he was "optimistic" for a positive resolution to the crisis following telephone consultations with foreign ministers from the other G7 countries.
Vitaly Churkin, Russian representative at the United Nations declared to journalists that Russia would not accept the resolution on South Ossetia as prepared by the EU's presidency. It is not certain whether Churkin made the statement before or during negotiations over the resolution. The document proposes an immediate cease-fire, and restoring the territory of Georgia as it was before the beginning of the conflict.
A report from Interfax cited the Abkhaz defense headquarters as saying Abkhaz troops backed up with Russian paratroopers had launched an operation early in the day to push Georgian forces out of the northern part of the Kodori Gorge. According to "The New York Times", Abkhaz Deputy Minister of Defense Garri Kupalba said on the previous day that there were 2,500 Georgian troops in the area, but 1,000 civilians had left the gorge through a humanitarian corridor which was opened for civilians and soldiers to get out safely before "the operation to eliminate Georgian troops will begin".
As said by Madina Shavlokhova, Gzt.Ru reporter, she saw ex-commander of Vostok special battalion Sulim Yamadayev in South Ossetia within Vostok battalion. Later it was confirmed by his brother Isa Yamadayev, commander of 5th Company of Vostok. He said that 215 soldiers of Vostok are commanded by Sulim. Early, Sulim Yamadayev was declared as federal wanted for murder after conflict with Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov. Isa Yamadayev said that he is in Gudermes and later will move to South Ossetia with 100 soldiers.
Deputy Chief of the General Staff of Russia, Colonel General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, said the remaining Georgian troops in South Ossetia were surrendering and leaving the area. Nogovitsyn also said Russia had gained full control over Georgian airspace.
The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation reported that they had arrested the Deputy Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Georgia, according to RIA Novosti. According to the Russian special services, the Georgian agents were instructed to create centers of armed resistance to the authorities in southern Russia.
An Associated Press reporter has seen 135 Russian military vehicles, including tanks, driving toward the Kodori Gorge, held by Georgian forces. The acting Georgian ambassador to Britain has told Sky News that Russian jets are bombing civilian targets in Georgia despite Moscow's announcement that the war has ended. Sergei Bagapsh, the President of Abkhazia said Abkhaz forces had taken the towns of Ashara and Tchalta and were advancing to the Georgian border. He said Abkhazia controls most of the Upper Kodori Gorge. A group of 250 Abkhaz soldiers was reported to have clashed with Georgian forces in the Gorge at the edge of Abkhazia. Abkhazia's chief of the General Staff of the armed forces, Anatoly Zaitsev, stated that Abkhazia's armed forces have surrounded the Georgian troops in the Kodori Gorge. Zaitsev said 250 Abkhazian servicemen had landed near the settlement of Chkhalta, meeting resistance from Georgian units, who fired on them with small arms. The second Abkhazian unit is due to back up the first group of servicemen. The foreign Minister of Abkhazia, Sergei Shamba said that Abkhazian Air Force and artillery have been delivering missile and bomb strikes on military objects in the upper part of the Kodori Gorge. Units of the regular troops and reservists of the armed forces of Abkhazia are taking part in the operation.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said Georgia would declare Russian peacekeepers occupiers and the breakaway states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia occupied territory. He also announced Georgia would withdraw from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Georgia has also filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice accusing Russia of carrying out ethnic cleansing in the 2008 conflict and in 1993. The deputy speaker of the Russian State Duma called for Russia to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent because of the conflict. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Malakhov said recognition would be "premature" before the crisis was resolved.
Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Secretary-General of NATO, said Georgia remains a candidate for NATO membership in spite of the conflict.
On August 13, a reporter for the UK "Guardian" claimed that "the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous", saying Chechen, Cossack and Ossetian irregulars were following advancing Russian lines near Gori burning Georgian villages.
An Associated Press report at 16:00 UTC claimed that "Russian troops and paramilitaries thrust deep into Georgia on Wednesday, rolling into the strategic city of Gori" said that "an AP reporter later saw dozens of tanks and military vehicles leaving the city, roaring southeast." Sky News correspondents claimed that tanks were on the streets in Gori, adding that they and Norwegian journalists were robbed at gunpoint, apparently by South Ossetian irregulars.
The New York Times said Czech journalists were also robbed and claimed that "the Russian military had firmly occupied this leafy city" of Gori. A reporter from the Belgian national television station VRT also confirmed that about 30 Russian armoured vehicles entered Gori in the morning and then positioned themselves on the hills around the city.
Al Jazeera correspondents in Poti reported "more and more Russian troops coming into the area all day" and the destruction of several Georgian vessels. Reporter Hoda Abdel Hamid claimed that "Russia is clearly on the offensive."
Russia, in turn, accused Georgia, saying "the assurances from the Georgian side that they have ended all military activities, Russian troops shot down a second Georgian drone over Tskhinvali earlier today."
U.S. President George W. Bush ordered U.S. military aircraft and naval vessels to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies. At 17:25 UTC the first U.S. C-17 Globemaster aircraft arrived in Tbilisi 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko signed a decree requiring that Russia seek the permission of Ukraine's armed forces "at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the Ukrainian border."
According to RIA News deputy chief of Russian joint staff general-colonel Anatoly Nogovicin says: "With all responsibility I say: we don't have our tanks in Gori. Administration of Gori shameful leave town before we come to it. And we can't set dialogue with anyone of Gori administration."
August 14 - August 16: Russian offensive stops in Gori and Igoeti.
Early on August 14, a reporter from the Belgian national television station VRT claimed that about 3 Russian armored cars were blocking a major road towards Gori. He also stated he saw tanks and snipers nearby.
A BBC correspondent claimed to have heard a series of explosions coming from hills around the town. The UK Telegraph said "South Ossetian irregulars continuing to loot and pillage in Gori and nearby Georgian villages, often with the encouragement of Russian troops".
According to Reuters, witnesses in Poti claimed that Russian tanks had entered the town and were "looting" or destroying infrastructure. Russia denied that its troops were in Poti.
Although U.S. Secretary of State Rice said "provisional ceasefire that was agreed to really must go into place. And that means that military activities have to cease" and Defence Secretary Gates accused the Russians of going "far beyond reasserting the autonomy of Abkhazia and South Ossetia," Gates nonetheless said that there was "no prospect" of US troops being deployed in the region.
According to Interfax, army of Russian Federation gave back control of Gori to army of Georgia. Russian minister of defence general-major Vyacheslav Borisov said: "All previous talks about damaged town and marauding do not correspond to reality". Secretary of National Defence Сouncil of Georgia Alexander Lomaya also agreed with this message and said in live broadcast on "Rustavi-2": "In whole situation in Gori is calm and now Russian army only keeps up the order".
Amid the ruins and tanks in the South Ossetian capital, the remaining residents shared scant goods and wondered why humanitarian aid promised by Russia has not arrived (Brisbane Times)
On August 15:
04:44 GMT – The Russian Federal Immigration Service has officially registered over 17,000 refugees from South Ossetia, who fled to Russia after Georgia’s military assault. 1820 of them are children. (Russia today's timeline of the conflict)
07:55 GMT – Georgians in South Ossetia who fled during last week's fighting will not be allowed to return to their homes in the breakaway republic, according to South Ossetia President Eduard Kokoity. (Russia today's timeline of the conflict)
09:28 GMT - A senior Russian military official said that five U.S. Air Force C-17 planes have landed at Tbilisi airport, bringing unknown cargo to Georgia. (Russia today's timeline of the conflict)
09:40 GMT - Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has blamed Georgia for provoking hostilities in its breakaway region of South Ossetia and criticised Western states for backing Tbilisi. (Russia today's timeline of the conflict)
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, meets Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in the Russian resort town of Sochi. (BBC's timeline of the conflict)
On Sochi meeting Mr Medvedev says Georgia should sign the ceasefire immediately but he cannot see the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia wanting to be a part of Georgia now. Moscow is not against the idea of having international peacekeeping forces in the two regions, he says, but the people living there only trust Russian peacekeepers. (BBC's timeline of the conflict)
At the same time, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in Tbilisi for talks with Georgia's President Mikhail Saakashvili, in a show of US support for the Georgian government. She brought with her the formal ceasefire agreement brokered by French and current European Union leader Nicolas Sarkozy. It is hoped Mr Saakashvili will sign the agreement. (BBC's timeline of the conflict)
Amidst what the Associated Press described as "intense diplomacy to persuade Russia to pull troops out of Georgia", "tensions soared" after Russian General Anatoly Nogovitsyn was quoted by the Interfax News Agency as saying that by accepting a US missile battery Poland "is exposing itself to a strike".
The Georgian Foreign Ministry stated in a press release that Russia had destroyed a major railway bridge in the Kaspi district responsible for bisecting Georgia from east to west and linking the hinterland to seaports on the Black Sea. Russian denied blowing up the bridge.
According to the International Herald Tribune, Russian military units advanced to Igoeti, their closest approach yet to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. The newspaper said the move "opened a new security vacuum between Gori and creating fresh targets" for "looters and armed gangs in uniform - many of them apparently Ossetians, Chechens and Cossacks - [who have operated behind the army's path, ransacking villages largely vacated by fleeing civilians."
The IHT also noted that "Russian soldiers remained in Zugdidi and Senaki in western Georgia, and another armored patrol roamed the roads to Abasha, near Kutaisi. A large contingent still held Gori, astride the country's most important road."
A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement claimed that Russian forces and separatist units had taken 13 villages in the buffer zone along the border of the separatist region of Abkhazia that was created at the end of the 1992-1993 war over the region. The statement went on to claim that temporary administrations had been set up in those villages. A power plant was also claimed to have been taken in the maneuver. The statement indicated that the effect of this action was to shift the border of Abkhazia toward the Inguri River.
According to the Associated Press, Russian forces were "digging in" at Igoeti, which is about 30 miles west of Tbilisi.
August 17: Russians say withdrawal to begin August 18.
On August 17, Georgia accused the Russian army of destroying a key railway bridge and starting massive fires in the scenic Borjomi Gorge, in violation of a new cease-fire agreement between the two countries. The BBC's Richard Galpin, who has spent the past two days travelling from the Black Sea port of Poti to Tbilisi, says Georgian forces seem to be surrendering control of the highway to the Russians (BBC).
The UK Guardian said that South Ossetian forces had captured Akhalgori while the New York Times reported that Russia had deployed SS-21 Scarab missile launchers to South Ossetia, an accusation that Russia denies.
Russia's president Medvedev nonetheless said Russian troops would begin pulling out of Georgia on Monday.
August 18: Russian pull-out claims.
Anatoli Nogowizyn from the Russian General Staff said around noon that Russia had started to pull troops from Georgia. By 14:00 UTC - 5:00 PM in Georgia - ARD-correspondent Olaf Bock hadn't heard of any independent observers reporting either troop movement out of Gori or troops coming into North Ossetia from South Ossetia.
Four armored vehicles appeared in the village of Igoeti, intending to move towards the village of Lamiskana. Georgian police resisted the Russians and made a barrier with their vehicles; however, the soldiers received an order from their general to drive over the police vehicles and so they did. The police managed to get out of the cars and no one was injured.
Late on afternoon, Russian units were still operating in the center of the country. Russian military convoys continued to move in and out of Gori, about 40 miles northwest of Tbilisi, including tanks and an anti-aircraft gun. The situation was the same in western Georgia, the second flank of the Russian offensive. There was no evidence of a Russian pullback by mid-afternoon in and around Zugdidi, near Georgia's border with the rebel province of Abkhazia. As they had the day before, Russian tanks occupied the regional police compound there. In the morning, a convoy of 12 Russian military vehicles, including three tanks, rolled south toward the key Black Sea port of Poti. In Senaki, Russian forces continued to occupy a Georgian air base and other positions in the city, located along Georgia's main east-west highway.
According to RIAN, Russian troops were pulling out of the South Ossetian capital Tskinvali.
August 19: Russians shut down port of Poti; NATO meeting called.
The Wall Street Journal said Russian forces had seized control of Poti, rendering "another big blow to Georgia's economy." An Azeri news source quoted a Poti port official as saying, "workers were expelled from the port".Russian forces reportedly commandeered the Georgian missile boat, "Tbilisi", and sank it.
NATO countries convened for an "emergency summit" in Brussels to find some consensuses on a response towards Russia in regard to the conflict in Georgia. While, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov levelled accusations at NATO of being "unobjective and biased" in maintaining support for a "criminal regime" that is "failing." 
The United Nations Security Council met to hear a briefings about the situation, including brief statements about human rights abuses and relief shipments to the area, and the promise of a permanent Russian military base in South Ossetia. The Georgian ambassador reported cases of destruction of their civilian and military infrastructure and alleged a Russian backed cyber attack. The Russian ambassador accused other parties of engaging in propaganda.
August 20–22: Russian withdrawal.
A claim was made by an official from the Poti port that the Russian military had withdrawn. However, Russian forces have remained in the port as of August 22, "excavating trenches, setting up mortars and blocking a key bridge with armored personnel carriers and trucks."
Despite selective Russian fortification in some areas, some Russian forces were seen heading north, out of the area that the French-brokered cease fire signed between Russia and Georgia demanded Russia leave. There was question as to whether or not Russian forces would have left the area fully by Friday, as they had stated they would since Tuesday. There were reports of Russian forces looting civilian property and of civilian starvation in Gori.
Russia has announced its promised troop pullout from Georgia is complete. Russia says it will keep a permanent military presence in a large buffer zone bordering Georgia’s breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. According to a White House spokesman, American President Bush and French President Sarkozy have agreed that Russia is not in compliance with the cease fire that Sarkozy brokered between Georgia and Russia. The Kremlin, however, says in a formal announcement, that President Sarkozy, in a telephone conversation with Russian President Medvedev, has shown satisfaction with the Russian withdrawal.
August 24.
On the 24th of August, with Russian forces still within the port of Poti, a US warship has arrived with supplies and aid.

August 26.
Both houses of the Russian Parliament pass unanimous resolutions calling on President Medvedev to support the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
August 27.
President Medvedev of the Russian Federation signed two Presidential decrees recognizing the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia as sovereign independent states to authorize the drafting of treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with the new states.
The Georgian pilotless flying machine is shot down( Southern Ostetii Michael Mindzaev has informed the Ministry of Internal Affairs).
August 28.
The United Nations Security Council held a meeting to hear briefings about the humanitarian implications of the conflict, and for both sides to state their positions on the issue.
September 9.
Russia announced it would keep 7,600 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia for the foreseeable future, asserting power in the breakaway regions even as it began a pullout from positions deeper in Georgia.
September 12.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin insists to reporters that President Dmitry Medvedev had no choice but, to attack Georgia as Russia had been encircled on all sides. "(Georgia) attacked South Ossetia with missiles, tanks, heavy artillery and ground troops. What were we supposed to do? If his country had not invaded, he said, it would have been like Russia "getting a bloody nose and hanging its head down", and there would be a "second blow" into the north Caucasus," said Putin in defence of Russia's heavily criticized action.
September 13.
Russian troops start withdrawal from Georgia. By 11:00 MSK, all posts near Poti were abandoned, while withdrawals from Senaki and Khob followed.
October 3.
A car-bomb exploded in Tskhinvali near the Russian peacekeeping headquarters killing seven Russian soldiers and wounding another seven. The Russians and South Ossetians accused the Georgian Security Ministry of being behind the attack, the Georgians denied it and further accused the Russians of orchestrating the attack so they would have enough of a reason to maintain their military presence in Georgia.

SANAE IV

SANAE IV is the current research base of the South African National Antarctic Expedition and is part of the South African National Antarctic Program (SANAP). The other two bases in SANAP are Gough Island and Marion Island.
Location.
Located in the Queen Maud Land region of Eastern or Greater Antarctica, SANAE IV is on top of a distinctive flat-topped nunatak, Vesleskarvet, on the fringe of the Ahlmann Range of mountains. The base is approximately 80 km from the edge of the continent (also known as the grounding line or hinge zone) and 160 km from the edge of the ice shelf. Vesleskarvet is completely surrounded by the glacial ice sheet.
Concept.
The first three SANAE research stations were located on the Fimbul Ice Shelf near to the coast, and were subject to the gradual snow burial and eventual crushing that occurs with all stations constructed in this fashion. With a vision of creating a more permanent station, SANAE IV was completed in 1997 using a design which was revolutionary at the time - a structure raised on stilts which allows snow to blow through underneath and thus limits deposition.
By constructing the base near the cliffs of Vesleskarvet, the concept was advanced further: snow that would collect downwind of the base and eventually advance to cover it is instead blown off the 250 m high cliffs into the wind-scoop beyond. By virtue of this clever design, the station should far exceed the short useful life of its predecessors, and the raised design has since been applied to newer stations, such as the British Antarctic Survey's new Halley Research Station and Germany's new Neumayer III.
The station has an orange coloured roof for better visibility from the air. The underside of the station used to be painted in a blue colour which in theory was warmed somewhat by the sun and contributed to reducing the build-up of ice undernearth the station. In 1999 the South African minister of Environment and Tourism decided that this colour scheme is too reminiscent of South Africa's old flag, and ordered the orange roof to be painted bright red. Eventually, the roof remained orange but the blue underside was painted red.
Base layout.
SANAE IV consists of three linked modules, each double-story, long and wide. Two smaller nearby structures contain the satellite dish used for communications and the diesel fuel bunkers. Joined end-on-end in a north-south orientation, the base modules are complemented on the northern end by a large raised helicopter landing area with a lifting section allowing vehicles to be brought up into the hangar for maintenance.
C-block, the northern-most module, contains the large hangar, generator room, workshop, water storage, sewage processing plant, equipment stores, offices of the mechanical and electrical engineers, flight operations office, gymnasium and sauna. The neutron monitors of the North-West University are also housed in this area.
B-block, the middle module, contains the kitchen, dining area, two TV lounges, bar, games room, smoker's room, library, a laundry and accommodation units.
A-block, the southern module, contains the radio room and communications hub, medical facility, darkroom, various research project offices, leader's office, two physics labs, wet lab, store-rooms, another laundry, and accommodation units.
The modules are linked by single-story connections that also serve as entrances with stairways down to the surface 4m below the base. Each link contains an entrance hall with two sets of doors (creating a rudimentary 'air-lock' to prevent excessive cooling when entering and exiting the base) as well as a change-room, ablution facility and electronic distribution boards.
Facilities.
The base generates power using three diesel generators. Water is generated by manually shovelling snow into a snow smelter, which then melts the snow and ice and pumps water automatically into the holding tanks. Waste water and sewerage is treated within the base, with the only by-product being clean water which is then released back into the environment. All refuse is sorted, crushed and sealed in empty fuel drums for return to South Africa.
Although the base is well insulated by its half-meter thick walls and triple-glazed windows, the internal areas have to be actively warmed. This is accomplished by three means. Firstly, the heat generated by the diesel generators is used to heat water for the taps and showers, which is then circulated through the base. Secondly, the same generator heat is used to heat air which is distributed by the climate control system. Thirdly, small electric wall and fan heaters are available in all indoor areas. Efforts are made to maintain the interior temperature at 18 °C, although some areas (such as the hangar) do cool well below this in winter.
SANAE IV has advanced communications capabilities using both satellite and radio systems. A permanent satellite connection to the SANAP headquarters in Cape Town provides three telephone lines and one fax line, and near-broadband internet access. Team members in Antarctica enjoy fast internet access which allows them to correspond with colleagues and stay in contact with friends and family.
Staff.
The base is staffed and maintained year-round by a team of scientists and support personnel. Each overwintering team arrives during the summer expedition and take-over period aboard the research and logistics vessel "S. A. Agulhas 2", stays at the base through the austral winter and returns to South Africa at the end of the next summer season - an expedition of approximately 16 months. The summer expedition and re-supply team (excluding ship's crew) consists of 80–100 persons, and includes administrative staff, heavy vehicle operators, helicopter crew, maintenance staff, the new overwintering team and a large scientific contingent. During the brief summer (typically December/January to February/March) the base must be resupplied with food, equipment and fuel, all waste products must be removed for transport back to South Africa, the new overwintering team must receive on-site training, and scientific investigations which cannot be undertaken in the winter months (such as extended field-work) must be completed.
The overwintering team remains at the base alone and isolated between the months of March and December. To be fully self-sufficient, the team typically consists of the following personnel:
An expedition leader is selected from the overwintering team prior to the departure of the expedition, and a deputy elected to serve in his place should the need arise. The expedition leader is responsible for administrative tasks and reports to the South African National Antarctic Programme headquarters in South Africa.
Research.
SANAE IV's reason for existence is to provide a permanent year-round base for scientists undertaking research projects under the auspices of SANAP. Investigations carried-out year-round are predominantly in the physical sciences, while the summer months allow research in more diverse fields such as oceanography, biology, geology and geomorphology. Recent projects have also focused on sources of renewable energy such as solar and particularly wind power generation. There is not currently any formal medical research being undertaken.
Ongoing physical science research programs includes the Antarctic Magnetospheric and Ionospheric Ground-based Observation (AMIGO), Southern Hemisphere Auroral Radar Experiment (SHARE) and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), Antarctic Research on Cosmic Rays (ANOKS), very low frequency (VLF) radio research and various International Polar Year projects.
Detailed information about the research projects may be found under the research section of the SANAP webpage

Heutelia

Heutelia is a German book about a journey through Switzerland, published anonymously in 1658, and attributed to Hans Franz Veiras. It is notable as a work of baroque literature and as a critical account of social conditions in seventeenth-century Switzerland. 
The book consists of fewer than 300 octavo pages. The title page, besides omitting the author's name, does not indicate where or by whom it was published. The book has been incorrectly ascribed to Jakob von Graviseth.
The title, "Heutelia", is an anagram of "Helvetia", the Latin name of Switzerland. The invented name also evokes a Greek adjective meaning "with a full udder," thus playing on stereotypes of the Swiss as a nation of cowherds.

Tom Moss (Virginia)

Thomas Warren "Tom" Moss, Jr. (born October 3, 1928, in Norfolk, Virginia) is an American politician, serving as the City Treasurer of Norfolk, a post to which he was elected in 2001. Prior to that, he served 36 years as a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and was its Speaker 1991–2000.
Early life.
Moss received his bachelor's degree from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. He served in the United States Army during the Korean War period, attaining the rank of first lieutenant. Afterward, he attended the University of Richmond School of Law and set up a law office in his home town of Norfolk. He practiced law until his election as city treasurer in 2001.
Political career.
As a member of the Young Democratic Club of Norfolk, Moss was active in the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy.
House of Delegates.
In 1965 Moss ran for the Virginia House of Delegates as part of a racially mixed coalition of Democrats opposed to the pro-segregation state Democratic political machine of U.S. Senator Harry Flood Byrd, Sr. Running under the campaign slogan "get Norfolk out of the Byrd cage," Moss won his first election.
In 1980, when Speaker John Warren Cooke retired, House majority leader A. L. Philpott succeeded him and Moss was chosen as majority leader. Philpott, whose endorsement of Douglas Wilder's 1985 campaign for lieutenant governor helped pave the way for his election as governor in 1989, died of cancer in September 1991, shortly after announcing his retirement. Moss was elected Speaker on November 11, 1991.
Moss served one term as Speaker with a Democratic governor and state senate majority. Wilder was succeeded by two Republican governors, George Allen and Jim Gilmore, and the Senate passed into Republican hands in 1997. Democrats technically held a one-vote majority in the 1997-98 session; in fact the House was split 50-50, since the one independent member, Lacey Putney, caucused with the Republicans. Finally in 1999, Republicans won outright control of the House. Moss chose not to serve as minority leader in the next session, ceding the job to the previous majority leader, C. Richard Cranwell.
Post-House career.
Republicans had complete control of the Virginia redistricting process following the 2000 census. Moss' House district, the 88th, was moved from Norfolk to another part of the state, and he was placed in the neighboring 89th district, a majority African-American district represented by an African-American, Jerrauld Jones. Moss chose instead to run for city treasurer, replacing the retiring Joseph T. Fitzpatrick, a former state senator and state Democratic Party chair. Moss won election with 56% of the vote.
Four years later, Moss faced an internal challenge for the Democratic nomination, where concerns were expressed about his age and health. Moss chose instead to run as an independent, winning the reelection with 45% of the vote in a four-way race with three African-American opponents.

The following table gives a chronological overview of the mainline railway lines in Norway. It explicitly excludes tramway, light rail and metro lines, spurs and industrial lines. It contains the date the section opened, the line the segment is currently considered part of, the name of the line at the time of the opening (if different from the current name). Some railways have simply changed name, while others have been merged with other lines. The table further gives the length of the line, the gauge and number of tracks (single, double or quadruple), all at the time the line opened. Many railway lines have since been shortened and some have been doubled and been through gauge conversion. Standard gauge is , CAP gauge is and meter gauge is . Railway which opened as private are marked, even though many were later nationalized. In later years, many new sections are major realignments, typically tunnels, which shorten an existing line.

William Meninger

William Meninger, O.C.S.O. is an American Trappist monk, who is a noted spiritual teacher and the developer of Centering Prayer, a method of prayer which has become widespread throughout the world.
Early life.
Meninger was born, raised and educated in the Boston area in Massachusetts. His mother Katherine was born and raised in County Kerry, Ireland, and his father John was a Quaker from Pennsylvania. 
After studying at St. John's Seminary in Boston, Meninger was ordained a priest in 1958 for the Diocese of Yakima in the State of Washington, where he worked on an Indian reservation and with Mexican migrant workers for six years. In 1963 he entered the Trappists at St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts, where he served in the guesthouse for 15 years, as well as teaching scripture, liturgy and patristics to the younger member of the abbey. He served as subprior, prior and dean of the junior professed monks, not yet in final vows.
Centering Prayer.
During this time, Meninger came across a work by an English hermit of the 14th century, called the "Cloud of Unknowing". It was written to help people living regular lives in the world develop and deepen their prayer lives. He found that it taught contemplative prayer in a simple way available to anyone. He began to teach this method to the younger monks of the abbey and to the retreatants who had come to it for a period of spiritual reflection.
In 1974 Meninger developed the workshop on Contemplative Meditation (later known as Centering Prayer) which he now teaches worldwide along with workshops on Forgiveness, the Enneagram, Sacred Scriptures, and prayer. His method was further developed and promoted by two other monks of his abbey, Thomas Keating (his abbot at the time) and Basil Pennington.
Later life.
In 1979 Meninger was transferred to a daughterhouse of Spencer Abbey, St. Benedict's Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado, where he has served as Prior, vocation director, Master of novices, and teacher of theology and scripture. He spent 3 years in Israel where he studied scripture and taught at the "École Biblique" in Jerusalem and at the Trappist Monastery of Latrun.
Meninger also did graduate studies at Seattle University, Harvard Divinity School, and Boston University.

The Backyard (film)

The Backyard is a 2002 American backyard wrestling documentary directed, produced and edited by Paul Hough and was scored by Seth Jordan. It features the appearance of current WWE and former TNA professional wrestler, Rob Van Dam. Although it had a limited theatrical release in the United States in 2002, the film was later released to Germany and Australia in 2004.
Plot.
This documentary reveals the violent, bizarre depths of the world of backyard wrestling to the mainstream. Director Paul Hough was working on a syndicated wrestling program when an audition tape led him to discover the widespread phenomenon online. Males of different ages who cannot afford pro wrestling school tuition or choose to make their activities a lifestyle, turn to compete in the unsanctioned battleground of their backyard, with the use of deadly elements and weapons, such as barbed wire, light tubes, fire, glass and staple guns. The film showcases Hough's tour, as he tracks several underground wrestlers in Arizona, Nevada, California, New York and England.
Cast.
Most members of the cast go by their wrestling alias. The cast includes:
Distribution.
The film was released in select theaters in Germany and had a limited theatrical run in the United States. It was released on DVD and PSP, also later airing on television in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
Reception.
"The Backyard" holds a 74% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews, equating to an average rating of 6.6 out of 10. Overall, it was met primarily with positive reviews. Dave Kehr, a writer for "The New York Times", called it an "astounding anthropological study of that strange tribe known as the American teenager", and finished by claiming it is "strange" and "disturbing." John Petrakis of "The Chicago Tribune" labelled it a "first-rate documentary." Charles Martin chipped in for Film Threat, viewing the film as "a fascinating emotional rollercoaster", and that it "approaches the subject with genuine curiosity." Contributing his thoughts, Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post believes it's not for the squeamish, but that its "bone-crunching message is worth hearing."

Bavarian Gts 2x3/3

The Bavarian Class Gts 2x3/3 was a former narrow gauge, German Army, military railway, steam locomotive that was in service on the narrow gauge line from Eichstätt to Kinding.
The State railway locomotive.
The locomotive was built in 1917 by Henschel & Sohn in Kassel under works number 15160 for the German Army's field railways. After the end of World War I the engine was sold to the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn"). It was designated as Class Gts 2x3/3 and was given the number 996. It was employed on the Eichstätt–Kinding narrow gauge route. After the take over of the German state railways by the Deutsche Reichsbahn it was given the number 99 201 and classified as DRG Class 99.20.
In order not to exceed the permitted axle load, the locomotive was equipped with six axles, which were grouped into two groups of three, each with its own driving gear. This compound engine was of the Mallet locomotive type. The preheater was located in front of the chimney and lay parallel to the axis of the locomotive.
The engine could carry 1.5 tonnes of coal and 4.5 m² of water.
After the conversion of its home line, Eichstätt–Kinding, to standard gauge in 1934 the locomotive was withdrawn from service and later scrapped.
Background information to the locomotive class.
Army field railway locomotives.
Locomotive 99 201 was one of a total of 20 engines, that Henschel delivered to the German Army for their field railways. Several of the machines were destroyed in the war, others were abandoned abroad, for example in France. Several engines of this series were employed on the Hedjaz railway from Damascus to Medina.
Copies.
After World War I Henschel produced two further copies of this class:
Unlike the original German Army field railway engines, the copies were built as saturated steam locomotives.
Preserved examples.
One example was in service with the Blonay–Chamby museum railway at Lake Geneva. The locomotive is currently non-operational and can be seen in the railway museum there.
Mallet locomotives 413 and 414 of the Chemin de fer du Vivarais do not belong to this class. The two engines were built in the 1930s in Alsace.

2009 Masters Tournament

The 2009 Masters Tournament was the 73rd Masters Tournament, held April 9–12 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Ángel Cabrera, age 39, won his second major title in playoff over Chad Campbell and Kenny Perry. Cabrera became the first Masters champion from Argentina and South America.
Field.
The Masters has the smallest field of the major championships, and officially remains an invitation event, but there is now a qualification process. In theory, the club could simply decline to invite a qualified player. This is the list of all 96 players who qualified to play in the 2009 Masters Tournament.
Table.
Greg Norman, Gary Player, and Fuzzy Zoeller were playing their final Masters event. Ryo Ishikawa, aged 17, became the youngest professional ever to appear in the Masters.
Par 3 contest.
The annual par 3 contest was held on Wednesday, April 8. Tim Clark won with a score of -5 (22), two shots better than José María Olazábal and Jack Newman. Three players shot a hole-in-one: John Merrick on the second hole, Greg Norman on the sixth, and Clark on the ninth.
Round summaries.
The Masters Tournament is played over four days with an 18-hole round being played each day, for a total of 72 holes plus practice rounds and a par-three contest on the neighboring par-three course. Everyone outside the top 44 and ties or outside ten strokes of the leader was "cut" after two rounds.
First round.
The first round weather conditions were sunny and calm. Chad Campbell, scored a 7 under par 65, which included five straight birdies in the first five holes. Campbell finished the day with a one stroke lead over Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan. Larry Mize shot a five under par 67 to be two strokes behind. Mahan led the field in total birdies with 9 in the first round.
Second round.
Campbell continued his strong play with a 2 under par 70 to remain in the lead at 135 (–9) with Kenny Perry, who shot a bogey-free 67. Fuzzy Zoeller, 1979 champion, and three-time winner Gary Player completed their final rounds at Augusta. Anthony Kim shot the day's low round with a 65, which included a new record for most birdies in a round with eleven.
The cut, the top 44 players and ties, was at 145 (+1), and fifty players advanced to the weekend. In all, 25 players shot sub-par rounds for the day and the scoring average was 73.74. For the tournament, 32 players were under par, and the scoring average was 72.99.
Amateurs: Saxton (+3), Newman (+4), Kittleson (+6), Wilson (+10), Lee (+11).
Third round.
Third round conditions were sunny, but with gusty winds that made scoring a bit tougher than the previous two days. Perry shot a two-under par 70 to remain in the lead at 205 (-11), with Ángel Cabrera who shot a 69. Campbell led for most of the day until a double bogey on the 16th hole and carded 72, two strokes back at 207. Jim Furyk finished another stroke back of Campbell. Five players shot the day's low round of 4 under par 68. Those players were: Jim Furyk -8, Steve Stricker -7, Sean O'Hair -4, Ian Poulter -4, and Steve Flesch -3.
Final round.
Phil Mickelson birdied six holes on the front nine to score 30, tying a tournament record held by Johnny Miller, Greg Norman, and K. J. Choi. Third round co-leader Perry, age 48, led for most of the day; after birdies at 15 and 16, he disappointingly finished with bogeys at 17 and 18. He fell into a three-way tie at 276 (–12) with Ángel Cabrera and Campbell, leading to a sudden-death playoff.

Playoff.
The playoff began on the 18th hole and Campbell was eliminated after failing to get up and down from the right greenside bunker. Perry was just off the green to the right, chipped close, and tapped in for par. Cabrera scrambled after an errant tee shot and a recovery shot that ricocheted off a tree, fortuitously into the fairway. His third shot from ended away and he holed the putt to extend the playoff. The next hole was the 10th, and Perry failed to get up and down from left of the green; Cabrera two-putted from for par to become the first Argentinian to win the Masters.

Controversies.
Rory McIlroy was involved in a controversial incident during the second round. In sixth place on the leaderboard with three holes left to play, McIlroy had double-bogeyed the 16th hole before hitting his approach shot into a bunker on the 18th hole. He failed with his first attempt to get the ball out of the bunker and kicked out at the sand, which is an offense because it is deemed to be testing the condition of the hazard. He finished his round at 4:15 p.m. local time and at 8:40 p.m. was called to the clubhouse to view footage of the incident. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing, as a player is allowed to smooth over the sand provided that it does nothing to improve the position of the ball with regard to the next shot.
Also during the second round, while putting for birdie on the 15th green, Pádraig Harrington had stepped up to his ball and addressed it, but a gust of wind caused him to step away. The ball then moved, but since he had grounded his club previously, he was deemed to have caused it to move and was penalized one stroke. He completed the hole with a par 5.

1976–77 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1976-77 campaign was Huddersfield Town's second season in the 4th Division. Under Tom Johnston, Town almost gained promotion back to the 3rd Division, but a dreadful end to the season saw Town finish in 9th place with 50 points, 9 points off 4th place, which was taken by rivals Bradford City.
Review.
Town had a mixed start to the season, with wins and draws seeming to come from all over the place. Although they were never on a massive losing or unbeaten run under Tom Johnston, they mainly relied on new signing Kevin Johnson from Hartlepool, who scored 13 goals during the season.
They had a run of 7 straight wins during late January to early March saw Town climb ever nearer to promotion, but the last nine games (6 of them under Johnston's replacement, John Haselden) saw Town fail to win a single match, which saw Town slumber down the table into a final position of 9th place, just 14 points off 4th place, which was taken up by rivals Bradford City.

<doc id="18812442" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18812442" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Ipil">
Roman Catholic Diocese of Ipil

The Diocese of Ipil () is a Roman Catholic Diocese located in the city of Ipil in the Ecclesiastical province of Zamboanga in the Philippines. It is an ecclesiastical territory in the province of Zamboanga Sibugay. It occupies an area of 4,850 square kilometers extending from the boundary of Zamboanga del Norte on the north to Olutanga Island on the south, from the town of Tungawan on the west to the town Margosatubig on the east boundaries set by Pope John Paul II himself when he decreed the separation of this ecclesiastical territory from the Archdiocese of Zamboanga on December 24, 1979.
The area described above comprises the Province of Zamboanga Sibugay. The terrain is generally hilly bounded by mountains on the north and the Sibuyan Bay on the south. There are no large cities in the area; it is predominantly rural, predominantly agricultural, with rice, corn, rubber and coconut as the major crops. Of these only rubber is produced commercially. The overall economic situation of the area is very poor. Roads and facilities are inadequate.
The population covered by the prelature is 581,316 of which 62 per cent are Catholics. A majority of the population are migrants from the Central Visayas area, which accounts for the predominance of the Cebuano dialect, followed by Ilonggo. These are the dialects used in the Catholic liturgy.
History.
On December 24, 1979, the Territorial Prelature of Ipil was established from the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Zamboanga
The Prelature of Ipil is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Zamboanga with whom it shares much of its history of evangelization. The faith was first brought to the Zamboanga Peninsula by the Jesuit Missionaries as early as 1635. The Jesuit father took charge for many years over what was then considered mission territory. Two Jesuit priests Father Francisco Paliola and Father Alejandro Lopez lost their lives as martyrs in their efforts to win over the Muslim through diplomacy.
From 1910 the whole Island of Mindanao fell under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Zamboanga. In 1933, other ecclesiastical territories were established in Mindanao, separating themselves from Zamboanga, the last of which was the Prelature of Ipil in 1979.
Politically the two Zamboangas were just one province since the days of the Spanish era. Because of the many waves of migrations from the northern islands that occurred during the American era, the large province of Zamboanga was split up into two provinces in 1952.
On June 21, 1980, Bishop Federico O. Escaler, SJ, was transferred from Kidapawan to Ipil. At that time there were only 9 parishes with 13 priests, all Jesuits. In 1981 Bishop Escaler invited new groups to come and work in the prelature. And they came: the Spinola Sisters and the PIME Fathers. In 1981 the parish church of Ipil became a cathedral.
The years 1984 and 1985 were peak years of militarization and frequent encounters between the military and the rebels, members of the New People's Army (NPA) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). These were also the peak years of human rights violations.
In February 1985 the Bishop was kidnapped on his way to Zamboanga City. He was released after a few days, thanks to military-initiated operations. A prelature worker was also shot dead.
On April 4 of 1995, Ipil was again attacked, this time by breakaway elements of the Abu Sayyaf group. The town was set on fire and razed to the ground, and people were butchered to death. Press reports called it a massacre. All that had been so laboriously built went to rubble in a matter of hours.
In spite of these tragedies, the Prelature of Ipil went ahead and celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of its founding in June 1995. It was a celebration of faith and life, as manifested by the prelature's vision statement.
The Prelature's Vision Statement: "We, the people of God of the Prelature of Ipil, believe that God is present among us and has called all the peoples to protect and celebrate life. On the other hand, we feel deeply moved by the suffering that our people have to bear due to economic poverty, political oppression and cultural disinterest of so many people. We are concerned also over the ecological devastation of our environment. In this regard we believe that we are called to become a true Church of the poor and a community of disciples of Christ as the Gospel teaches, and the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines affirms."
There are 19 parishes in the prelature, 431 chapels and about 1500 Basic Christian Communities at present. Serving the parishes are 30 priests, 41 religious sisters and 40 lay workers. Among its institutions are 5 Catholic schools. Among its ministries are those on Christian Formation (KRISKA), Catechetics, Family Life, Tribal Filipinos, Youth, Community-based Health Program and Social Action.
On May 1, 2010, His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI elevated the Prelature of Ipil to a full diocese, the 58th in the Philippines, and appointed as its first bishop, Most Rev. Julius Sullan Tonel who had served as its Bishop-Prelate.

The Lonesome Place

The Lonesome Place is a short story written by famed Science Fiction writer August Derleth. The story is part of a compilation of short stories in the book "Lonesome Places". Published in 1962, by Arkham House Publishing, "The Lonesome Place" tells the story of two young boys terrorized by a mysterious creature who they believe lives in an abandoned grain elevator in their small town. 
Plot.
Taking place in an unnamed community, "The Lonesome Place" is told through the eyes of Steve, the narrator, and his best friend, Johnny Newell. The two boys are very scared of the dark and they believe that there is something living in the lonesome place. The lonesome place is an old grain elevator surrounded by tall trees and many piles of wood from the lumber yard that surrounds it. The story begins with the narrator's Mother asking her son to run errands for her before dinner at twilight. In order for the boy to get to the local grocery shop he needs to cross through the old lumber yard and past the lonesome place. At first sight, the lumber yard seems harmless enough, but after the sun goes down and the stars peep out into the sky the lumber yard becomes a place where shadows lurk and screams are drowned in darkness and never heard again. In the book it says Johnny and the narrator tend to run by the lonesome place when unable to avoid it because of the scary creature that they believe lives there. Both have their own hair-raising stories of going past the lumber yard and grain elevator at night. Johnny tells the narrator how the creature almost got him the night before, showing his ripped shirt as evidence of his close escape; the narrator returns with a tale of how he heard it knock over some lumber during his own trip through. The narrator has never seen the creature, but can feel its presence.
When the boys run past the dark place their hearts race and their imagination runs wild. As they compare their experiences they conjure up a monster with big clawed feet, scales, a long tail and yet has no face. This creature waits for fearful children on which to prey. The creature is also able to climb the tree and lie in the trees. The creature also is known to lay by the lumber but the children can’t see the creature because it’s so dark in The Lonesome place. 
When the grain elevator is torn down and the boys are all grown up and become less fearful of the Lonesome Place, the monster waits for other fearful boys and girls in the dark. Many of the boys take their dates here because the lumber yard is so creepy for the girls. When Bobby Jeffers is killed by being mauled by some type of animal, the narrator and Johnny believe they are responsible for the boy's death, since they had left that conjured monster free to feed on another child's fear. They felt that they should have done something about it when they were younger. Now that Bobby is dead the boys feel guilt for creating the monster out of their own fears.
Analysis.
In the chilling tale of "The Lonesome Place", two young boys compare terrifying stories of some unidentified creature that lives in an abandoned grain elevator. Although neither of the boys ever have a believable close encounter their imagination drives them and the story to unthinkable places. 
Uncannily, the story starts off with the unidentified narrator confessing to a murder, one that he committed. By the end of the story, the reader realizes that the crime really wasn't an act of murder, rather it was the act of apathy by keeping silent about a long-time secret lurking in the shadows of the community. Set in a small town, the story is grounded in real life with science-fiction like events. The boys felt they killed Bobb, but they didn't. They just felt because they created this creature with their imagination that they should have done something about it before they grew up and forgot about the creature. Derleth, a well-acclaimed Science Fiction writer, brings these themes and ideas into his Gothic writing. The monster is part of Gothic Fiction and is also part Science Fiction. In his book, "Writing Fiction" Derleth describes writing for the masses by keeping the story "true to life". Derleth was one of the editors for HP Lovecraft, a well-known author who wrote, " we must give (a fictional novel) the most elaborate possible approach."
Derleth does just that in "The Lonesome Place". Not only is the story centered in the reality of a suburban community but is also uses two young seven year old boys (the heroes) who have one fear and it's the dark. Who couldn't relate to that? which makes this story so real to all of us because everyone was or is afraid of the dark at one time or another.
In the beginning of the story the narrator confesses to being guilty of murder an uncanny opening because the reader isn't expecting it. This beginning leaves the reader feeling anxious and nervous. Is he unstable? Is his fear so paralyzing that he is unable to function in the real life? An unreliable narrator is another theme throughout American Gothic Fiction. 
Another theme that is so prevalent in Gothic literature is the theme of using domesticity as a way to create horror and terror. This theme is most prevalent in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper". Charlotte Perkins tells a story where, by yellow wallpaper, drives a woman to insanity. In "The Lonesome Place", Derleth uses a domestic, small town as a backdrop which has a grain elevator and an abandoned lumber yard. This presents a similar backdrop of many suburban lives. This setting is one distinction that separates American and English Gothic literature. English Gothic uses Gothic Architecture in its castles, churches and mansions for the dark settings for monsters and ghosts to prey, whereas American Gothic, devoid of castles and mansions, relies on more colonial settings. Drawing from the child's imagination, Derleth creates fantastic shadows and depths to every dark corner to create the creature's features. The reader never actually sees the creature but are forced to use their imagination, much like the two main characters. 
Using a Gothic-like atmosphere, the unstable narrator, and a monster that thrives in our nightmares, Derleth plays on one of the most natural and ordinary fear that almost everyone understands, the fear of loneliness and what lurks in the dark.
Reviews.
Author August Derleth is an acclaimed Science Fiction author that uses is vast background to create chilling tales in Gothic Literature. "The Lonesome Place" is no different. In the The Sidney Williams Journal "The Lonesome Place" is hailed as "one of the perfect chiller stories that focuses on the imagination."

Chodová Planá

Chodová Planá () is a market town with 1793 residents (As of January 1, 2004) in the Czech Republic. The town lies 537 m above sea level, some eight Kilometers south of the city Mariánské Lázně and belongs to the Okres Tachov ( Tachov District).
History.
Already a locality in 1316 - raised to a city in 1514 - mentioned in historical sources in the property of the knights Ctibor and Oldrich. The small stronghold from this time was inhabited until 1733.
From the 16th century the counts of Haimhausen had authority in Planá. A catastrophic fire in the 18th century burnt down the ancient church of the city in the year 1733 and was replaced in the years 1748-1754 by the new baroque church along with vicarage. The vicarage was dedicated to John the Baptist. In 1930 the statistic for religious affinity was counted with 1698 catholic and 37 non-Catholics.
In 1734 a small baroque castle was begun, a dipterous storied building with Mansard roof and 1906 another small castle.
The city is well known for the oldest brewery in the west-Bohemian region, which is named Chodovar. The first written reference to the brewery originates from , ownership was initially with the Adels family von Schlick. The brewery in 1634 already produced "1920 pailful", some 1173 litres.
The brewery is best known today for its "Original Beer Spa". Guests can soak in a dark lager/mineral water blend in copper tubs. The beer soak spa treatment is said to have medicinal benefits.
After a fire in 1861, the owners of the time left the Count of Berchem-Haimhausen the old stone basement which still today preserves the brewery, which belonged to the Count of Berchem-Haimhausen to the time of the Second World War . Today the Czech beer "Chodovar" comes from the brewery, which is now privately owned, in Chodová Planá.
Evidence of earlier brewing activities in the city exist, such as the historic Lager basement from the 14th century, which was hewn from granite and in the past used to brew special Lager beer. There is a small brewery museum in one part of the brewery basement and a restaurant.
Next to the municipal office of the city there is a primary school and a post office as well as the sports club TJ Slavoj Chodová Planá. To reach there one has to pass through a 40 meter long passageway.
Attractions in Chodová Planá are the small baroque castle and the spacious park with an old tree population. On January Chodová Planá was made into a market town.
Borough Classification.
The religious of Chodová Planá belong to the locality Boněnov ("Punnau"), Dolní Kramolín ("Untergramling"), Holubín ("Hollowing"), Hostíčkov ("Hetschigau"), Michalovy Hory ("Michelsberg"), Pístov ("Pistau"), Výškov ("Waschagrün") and Výškovice ("Wischkowitz").

San Carlos del Zulia

San Carlos del Zulia is the capital of Colón Municipality, located in Zulia State, Venezuela. Founded on March 14, 1778, by Captain Nicolás José Antúnez Pacheco y de la Cruz y Velasco, alderman of the city of Maracaibo, accompanied by lieutenant Ramón Hernández de la Calle, in charge of the pacification of Motilón Indians populating the area.
Description.
After the ceremonies of foundation, the site was platted and occupied on March 27, of the same year when the first 13 plots of land were demarcated and distributed among some of the earliest settlers. Captain Antúnez Pacheco also appointed its first mayor, Rafael Echeverria, and the members of its first city council or Cabildo. The plans for the layout of the city had been sent to, and received approval from, the royal courts in Spain the preceding year. Work on its construction commenced with the appointment of the new council and the religious destinies of the city were trusted to the Capuchin Order.
San Carlos del Zulia grew to become an important livestock and food distribution center for the northern Andean region and Apure State. Its growth joined together a few neighboring populations like Santa Bárbara del Zulia, forming a single urban center which now includes various industries: from sawmills to meat packing. Modern-day San Carlos is a medium size city with a population of over 50,000 souls. It is served by an airport, a thermal power station, and first rate educational and medical facilities. Famous for its beautiful natural sites, some of its most popular ones are: the Catatumbo, and Escalante rivers; the bogs of San Miguel de Agua Clara and Valderrama, and the Birimbay lagoon. San Carlos famous festival of Our Lady of Carmen takes every year place on July 16 and those of Santa Bárbara and San Carlos on November 4.

<doc id="18812559" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18812559" title="Quintus Valerius Soranus">
Quintus Valerius Soranus

Quintus Valerius Soranus (b. "circa" 140–130 BC, d. 82 BC) was a Latin poet, grammarian, and tribune of the people in the Late Roman Republic. He was executed in 82 BC while Sulla was dictator, ostensibly for violating a religious prohibition against speaking the arcane name of Rome, but more likely for political reasons. The "cognomen" Soranus is a toponym indicating that he was from Sora.
A single elegiac couplet survives more or less intact from his body of work. The two lines address Jupiter as an all-powerful begetter who is both male and female. This androgynous, unitarian conception of deity, possibly an attempt to integrate Stoic and Orphic doctrine, has made the fragment of interest in religious studies.
Valerius Soranus is also credited with a little-recognized literary innovation: Pliny the Elder says he was the first writer to provide a table of contents to help readers navigate a long work.
Life and political career.
Cicero has an interlocutor in his "De oratore" praise Valerius Soranus as “most cultured of all who wear the toga,” and Cicero lists him and his brother Decimus among an educated elite of "socii et Latini"; that is, those who came from allied polities on the Italian peninsula rather than from Rome, and those whose legal status was defined by Latin right rather than full Roman citizenship. The municipality of Sora was near Cicero's native Arpinum, and he refers to the Valerii Sorani as his friends and neighbors. Soranus was also a friend of Varro and is mentioned more than once in that scholar's multi-volume work on the Latin language. 
The son of Q. Valerius Soranus is thought to have been the Quintus Valerius Orca who was praetor in 57 BC. Orca had worked for Cicero's return to public life and is among Cicero's correspondents in the "Epistulae ad familiares" ("Letters to Friends and Family").
Cicero presents the Valerii brothers of Sora as well schooled in Greek and Latin literature, but less admirable for their speaking ability. As Italians, they would have been lacking to Cicero's ears in the smooth sophistication ("urbanitas") and faultless pronunciation of the best native Roman orators. This attitude of social exclusivity may account for why Valerius Soranus, whose scholarly interests and friendships might otherwise suggest a conservative temperament, would have found his place in the civil wars of the 80s on the side of the popularist Marius rather than that of the patrician Sulla. It might also be noted that Cicero's expression of this attitude is double-edged: like Marius and the Valerii Sorani, he was also a man from a "municipium", and had to overcome the same obstructing biases that he adopts and expresses.
In 82 BC, the year of his death, Valerius Soranus was or had been a tribune of the people ("tribunus plebis"), a political office open only to those of plebeian rather than patrician birth.
Execution.
The fullest account of the infamous death of Valerius Soranus is given by Servius, who says he was executed for revealing the secret name of Rome:
Servius's account presents several difficulties. Crucifixion was a punishment generally reserved for slaves in the Late Republic; Valerius Maximus, a historian in the early Principate, reckoned that the punishment should not be inflicted on those of Roman blood even when they "deserved" it. Moreover, a tribune's person was by law sacrosanct. Finally, it is unclear whether the ten tribunes should possess the knowledge of Rome's secret name, or in what manner Soranus would have publicized it. Among sources earlier than Servius, both Pliny the Elder and Plutarch note that Valerius Soranus was punished for this violation. It has been suggested that the name was revealed in his one work for which a title is known, the "Epoptides." The title, if interpreted as it sometimes is to mean "tutelary deities," offers an apt context. But elsewhere Servius — so too Macrobius — implies that the name remained unrecorded. 
Quintus Valerius Soranus has been identified with the Q. Valerius, described as "philologos" and "philomathes" (“a lover of literature and learning”), whom Plutarch says was a supporter of Marius. This man was put to death by Pompey in Sicily, where he would have accompanied Carbo, the consular colleague of the recently murdered Cinna. Carbo was executed by Pompey.
In 1906, Conrad Cichorius published an article that organized the available evidence for the life of Valerius Soranus and argued that his execution was a result of the Sullan proscription in 82. The view of his death as politically motivated has prevailed among modern scholars:
But if Varro originated the story, his reasons are hard to tease out of the roiled politics of the Late Republic. Although Varro was the friend of Valerius Soranus, in the civil war of the 40s he was on the side of the Pompeians; Caesar, however, not only pardoned him, but gave him significant appointments. The biases of the contemporary sources were not lost on Plutarch in his account of the killing:
Speaking the name could be construed as a political protest and also an act of treason, as the revelation would expose the tutelary deity and leave the city unprotected. This belief rests on the power of utterance to "call forth" the deity "(evocatio)", so that enemies in possession of the true and secret name could divert the divine protection to themselves. The intellectual historian of the Republic Elizabeth Rawson ventured cautiously that Soranus's "motive remains unclear, but may have been political." More vigorous is the view of Luigi Alfonsi, who argued that Soranus revealed the name deliberately so that the Italian municipalities could appropriate it and break Rome's monopoly of power.
Another interpretation of these events, worth noting despite its fictional context, is that of historical novelist Colleen McCullough, who melds political and religious motives in a psychological characterization. In "Fortune's Favorites", McCullough's Soranus “screams aloud” the arcane name because the atrocities committed during the civil war had rendered Rome unworthy of divine protection:
Literary works.
The single couplet that survives from Valerius Soranus's vast work as a poet, grammarian, and antiquarian is quoted by St. Augustine in the "De civitate Dei" (7.9) to support his view that the tutelary deity of Rome was the Capitoline Jupiter:
"Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque
"progenitor genetrixque deum, deus unus et omnes …"
The syntax poses difficulties in attempts at translation, and there may be some corruption of the text. It seems to say something like "Jupiter All-powerful, of kings and the material world and of gods the Father ("progenitor"), the Mother ("genetrix") of gods, God that is One and All … ." Augustine says that his source for the quotation is a work on religion (now lost) by Varro, with whose conception of deity Augustine argues throughout Book 7 of the "De civitate Dei". The view of Varro, and presumably of Soranus, was that Jupiter represents the whole universe which emits and receives seeds ("semina"), encompassing the generative powers of Earth the Mother as well as Sky the Father. This unitarianism is a Stoic concept, and Soranus is usually counted among the Stoics of Rome, perhaps of the contemporary school of Panaetius. The unity of opposites in deity, including divine androgyny, is also characteristic of Orphic doctrine, which may have impressed itself on Stoicism.
The couplet may or may not come from the "Epoptides". The title is mentioned only in Pliny, and none of the known fragments of Soranus can be attributed to this large-scale work with certainty. Soranus's innovation in providing a table of contents — most likely a list of "capita rerum" ("subject headings") at the beginning — suggests that the "Epoptides" was an encyclopedic or compendious prose work. Alternatively, the "Epoptides" may have been a long didactic poem. Soranus is known to have written didactic poetry and is likely to have been an influence when Lucretius chose verse as his medium for philosophical subject matter.
The most extensive argument regarding the "Epoptides" is that of Thomas Köves-Zulauf. Much of what can be conjectured about the work derives from the interpretation of its title. The Greek verb ἐποπτεύω ("epopteuo") has the basic meaning of "to watch, oversee" but also "to become an ἐπόπτης ("epoptes", "initiate," feminine "epoptis" and plural "epoptides")," the highest grade of initiate at the Eleusinian mysteries. Köves-Zulauf argued that Soranus's "Epoptides" was an extended treatment of mystery religions, and the title is sometimes translated into German as "Mystikerinen." The classicist and mythographer H.J. Rose, on the contrary, insisted that the "Epoptides" had nothing to do with initiates. Elizabeth Rawson held with "Initiated Women"; the Loeb Classical Library offers "Lady Initiates"; Nicholas Horsfall is satisfied with "The Watchers".
Köves-Zulauf maintains that the "epoptides" of the title represent the Stoic conception of female "daimones" who are guardians of humanity, such as the Hours ("Horae") and the Graces ("Charites"). Soranus integrates this concept, he says, with the "Tutelae", ancient Italic protective spirits. The crime of Soranus was thus to reveal in this work the name of the "Tutela" charged with protecting Rome.
Works of later Roman grammarians suggest that Soranus took an interest in etymology and other linguistic matters.

Rob Taylor (footballer)

Robert James "Rob" Taylor (born 16 January 1985) is an English footballer who plays for League One side Port Vale. He plays on the left flank and is known for his pace and dribbling ability.
A former non-league player with Solihull Borough, Redditch United, Evesham United, and Nuneaton Borough, his career in the Football League began later than most, as he chose to put his education before his football. He signed with Port Vale in August 2008, and after establishing himself in the first team in 2008–09, he played more than forty games in both the 2009–10 and 2010–11 campaigns. He helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012–13.
Playing career.
Non-league.
Taylor started off playing in the Southern League with Solihull Borough in 2004–05 and Evesham United in 2005–06. He was relegated in both seasons. He then played in the Conference North for Redditch United in 2006–07 and Nuneaton Borough in 2007–08, where he was a consistently good performer in the division.
Port Vale.
Despite several trials at league clubs he chose to put his education first and complete a degree at the University of Worcester. After a successful trial with Port Vale, where he scored in a reserve outing, manager Lee Sinnott signed him up on a two-year deal in readiness for the 2008–09 season. He scored on his Vale debut in a 3–1 victory against Luton Town. When Sinnott's replacement Dean Glover took charge of the club, Taylor found himself out of contention and when Glover himself was removed Taylor stated his ambitions to earn himself a first team place under fresh management.
During the start of the 2009–10 season, under new manager Micky Adams, Taylor found himself in the first team and a fan favourite. He played in the League Cup "Sheffield double" defeats of both Championship sides, also scoring past Wednesday. In the following league game against Hereford United he scored a superb goal, that would later win him the club's Goal of the Season award. In August he set himself a target of ten goals for the season. Under Adams, Taylor was utilized in an attacking role, rather than his original role as left-back/left midfielder.
He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. On 28 December 2009 he scored his sixth of the season at Grimsby Town's Blundell Park, before getting his second bookable offence, earning him the first sending off of his professional career. To his surprise and delight, his good form earned him a contract extension in January 2010 that tied him to the "Vale" until the summer of 2012. Adams said that he gave Taylor the contract to avoid other clubs making attempts to tempt him away from Vale Park.
Taylor found himself in the treatment room after tearing his hamstring in only his second start of the 2010–11 campaign. After recovering earlier than expected he aimed to regain his first team place. On 8 January he scored a brace past Championship side Burnley in Vale's 4–2 FA Cup defeat at Turf Moor. These would be two of only three goals that season, though he ended the campaign with 41 appearances to his name.
He started the 2011–12 season on the bench. After he scored in his first start of the season, a Football League Trophy tie with Tranmere Rovers, he cemented his first team place with a brace against Bradford City in the league. However he picked up an Achilles injury in February that left him unfit to play. He finished the season with three goals in 34 appearances, and agreed to sign a new two-year deal with the club in May 2012.
He missed all of the 2012–13 pre-season training with a calf injury. Vale secured promotion with a third-place finish at the end of the season, with Taylor making 32 appearances.
Taylor missed the whole of 2013–14 pre-season after damaging his Achilles tendon, and was out of training for close to five months. He marked his first appearance of the season on 23 November with a goal in a 2–1 victory over local rivals Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. He made a further three appearances before missing six weeks from mid-December onwards with a thigh injury.
Style of play.
An attacking left-sided player, he is known for his pace and ability to beat defenders.
Personal life.
Taylor holds a degree in Sports science from the University of Worcester. He is a Manchester United supporter.

Stanley Price

Stanley Price (December 31, 1892July 13, 1955) was an American film supporting actor who appeared in over 200 films between 1922 and 1956. He was born in Kansas, United States.
Career.
Price was an actor whose artistic career spanned four different decades, from silents through talkies to the advent of color. He debuted in the silent movie "Your Best Friend" (William Nigh, 1922), sharing starring duties with Vera Gordon and Harry Benham.
After that, he became a familiar figure, wearing either cowboy rustler outfits or gangster nice suits, particularly in the cliffhanger serials of the 1930s through the early 1950s. 
Usually, he served as the assistant or second-in-command for the "brains heavy". He usually wore workmanlike duds, did the physical labor, and often had more brawn than morality. Thus, Price went from one chapter to the next trying desperately to kill the hero with fists, knives, guns, bombs or whatever else happened to be handy at the time. Nevertheless, he was another of these loyal henchmen who always seemed to break down and turn into a gutless weasel and outright coward when confronted by the hero.
Eventually, Price was simply a doctor, barkeep, native, reporter, prosecutor, banker, chemist, reporter, psychotic or nobility member, appearing in about 100 westerns and 39 serials. His flair for comedy also was well represented in the film "Road to Morocco", as the blithering idiot in the opening bazaar scene, as well in The Three Stooges films "Punchy Cowpunchers", "Dopey Dicks" and "Studio Stoops". He also had at least 18 dialogue director credits for Lippert Studios.
Death.
Price died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California at age 62. He was buried in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery.

Bothriopsis punctata

Bothriopsis punctata is a venomous pitviper species found in South America and Panama. No subspecies are currently recognized.
Description.
Adults commonly grow to more than 100 cm in length and may exceed 150 cm. The shape of the body and long tail suggest that it is semiarboreal. The head is long and lance-shaped and the fangs exceptionally long.
The scalation includes 25-29 rows of dorsal scales, 186-211/191-213 ventral scales in males/females and 70-95/80-90 paired subcaudal scales in males/females. The tail ends in a long rounded spine that may turn upwards slightly at the tip. On the head there are 6-9 intersupraocular scales, 7-9 supralabial scales, the second of which contacts the prelacunal, and 11-12 sublabial scales.
The color pattern consists of a pale brown to greenish tan ground color overlaid with 16-22 pairs of darker brown paravertabral blotches that have pale edges. Some of these blotches coalesce dorsally. These blotches are offset by a row of lateral blotches that create a semibanded appearance. Below this is a third series of dark blotches, alternated with lighter spots, that extends down onto the ventral scales. The belly is cream to pale tan with brown spots. A dark brown cheek stripe is present that is darkest along the outer edges where it is narrowly bordered by a lighter color that can sometimes be orange or yellow.
Geographic range.
Found from the Darién of Panama along the Pacific slope of Colombia and Ecuador to extreme northern Peru. The type locality given is "Las Montañas del Dagua" (Colombia).
Habitat.
Occurs in tropical moist and wet forest, subtropical moist and wet forest, and in montane wet forest.
Venom.
Based on its size, this snake is probably capable of delivering a fatal bite. Although it does not seem to be common anywhere, Ayerbe (1990) states that, in the regions where it occurs, it is the most dangerous species together with the common lancehead, "Bothrops atrox". Angel-Mejía (1987) mentions a bite victim who was treated in Medellín for acute renal failure.
Taxonomy.
Campbell & Lamar (2004) re-classified this species, referring to it as "Bothrops punctatus".

Islam in North Ossetia–Alania

Islam is the second most widely professed religion in the North Ossetia–Alania.
While the majority of Ossetians are Christian (predominantly Eastern Orthodox), according to official estimates, 15–40 percent of the population of North Ossetia–Alania is Muslim (predominantly Sunni).
History.
The Digor in the west came under Kabard and Islamic influence. It was through the Kabardians (an East Circassian tribe) that Islam was introduced into North Ossetia–Alania in the 17th century.
Islam today.
The Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz houses the Mukhtarov Mosque, built in the beginning of the 20th century. Money for the construction of the mosque was donated by the Azerbaijani tycoon Murtuza Mukhtarov. The mosque was built in the Egyptian style and has no architectural analogies in the North Caucasus. After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, Islam, like all other religions in the Soviet Union, was suppressed and many mosques and Muslim theological schools were closed. It was only after the collapse of the Soviet Union that a massive religious revival occurred. Islam began to be practiced more openly.

Special exhibitions allow the Museum to feature renowned regional and national artists. In addition, the Museum showcases works of significance to Western North Carolina’s cultural heritage including Studio Craft, Black Mountain College and Cherokee artists. The Museum also offers a wide array of educational programs for children and adults.
History.
Incorporated in 1948, the original home was a three-room building on Charlotte Street, once the land sales office of E.W. Grove, developer of the Grove Park Inn. By 1950, the Museum began acquiring a permanent collection. Quickly, the collection outgrew its home, and the Museum moved to donated space on the 15th floor of the Northwest Bank, now the BB&T building. Forced to move in 1970, the Museum purchased property in the Montford Area Historic District of Asheville. A first full-time Director was hired, and exhibitions became more regional in scope. Programming and attendance expanded, but the aging 40-year-old building presented problems. When plans for the Asheville Civic Center were announced in 1972, the Museum Board accepted an invitation to be one of the three cultural agencies in the center. In 1976, the Museum opened a facility in the Civic Center. In 1984, the Asheville Art Museum became one of few of its size to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. 
In 1992, the Museum opened in a 1925 Italian Renaissance style building with contemporary additions that was once a library. That facility includes of space at Pack Place in the heart of downtown Asheville. A modest capital expansion, completed in 1999, added space from Pack Place and the adjacent Legal Building, creating new classroom and studio facilities, an art library, a teacher resource center, a community gallery and a new entrance.
