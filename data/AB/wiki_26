Everything That Happens Will Happen Today

Everything That Happens Will Happen Today is the second album made in collaboration between David Byrne and Brian Eno, released on August 18, 2008, by Todo Mundo. The album explores themes of humanity versus technology and optimism in spite of bleak circumstance through the blending of electronic and Gospel music. Critical reception was largely positive and the album received awards for both the musical content as well as the packaging and technical production.
This album is the first joint effort between the two musicians since 1981's "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts" and Eno's work producing and co-writing with Talking Heads. Byrne and Eno worked on the tracks in their home studios throughout 2007 and early 2008 and sent digital copies of the recordings to one another over e-mail. The single "Strange Overtones" was released for free to promote the album and Byrne toured through 2008 and 2009, performing songs from this release as well as the duo's previous collaborations. This tour was later documented with the live extended play "" and the concert film "Ride, Rise, Roar".
"Everything That Happens Will Happen Today" was released with a unique marketing strategy that involved Byrne creating the vanity label Todo Mundo and hiring Internet startup company Topspin Media to promote the album online using word-of-mouth and Internet sales to market the music. Several formats were created to allow users to have options on how to listen to the music—from free streaming audio to a deluxe package housed in a tin.
Background.
In December 2007, David Byrne announced on the <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> Radio music show "The Weekender" that he was working with former collaborator Brian Eno on a brand new album of "proper songs," describing it as a "completely different thing" from the experimental "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts". While the two were discussing the 2006 remix of that album at a dinner party, Eno suggested adding lyrics and vocals to some of his unfinished songs, some of which were eight years old. The duo did not initially plan on making an entire album, but eventually felt confident enough to finish a full collection of songs. Although the two had discussed making an album together for several years, this was their first sincere effort since the early 1980s.
Byrne visited Eno's London studio to listen to the demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs, leaving Eno and Peter Chilvers to convert a variety of digital music formats into <abbr title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr>, thereby stripping out extraneous information and making them suitable for Byrne to embellish. (Chilvers would be thanked in the liner notes as "Digital Archaeologist"). The two continued to work on this and other musical projects for several months and agreed that if the project was not enjoyable, they would abandon it. The duo decided to not announce their new collaboration for fear that they may not complete an album's worth of new material, or that they would end up re-treading their previous collaborations and decide against releasing the new songs.
Composition.
Eno had several musical compositions, but could not write lyrics to accompany them, whereas Byrne had several lyrics with no accompaniment. Eno wanted to make the vocals the "central event" of the music by pairing Gospel singing with unexpected electronic music that also included elements of West African music. The songwriting's emphasis on vocals was partially inspired by Phillip Bimstein. In late 2007, Byrne took a Compact Disc of stereo mixes of the demos from Eno and spent a year trying to write lyrics to finish the songs, attempting to balance the simple chords that Eno had written with the more complex ones Byrne prefers. Although it was uncharacteristic for Eno, many of the songs were written on acoustic guitar, with the help of Steinberg Cubase. The musicians exchanged Eno's demos with the lyrics and vocal melodies completed by Byrne over e-mail and by June 2008, 14 songs had been recorded. Eno initially gave positive feedback, which encouraged Byrne to continue writing and only became critical as the project was finishing. Toward the end of the recording, Eno sent increasingly challenging tracks to see if Byrne could complete them—the final two ended up on the album as "I Feel My Stuff" and "Poor Boy".
At the outset, Byrne was hesitant to add lyrics to the tracks because they sounded too much like folk music. He characterized the process as very slow and full of trepidation, in part because of expectations from their previous collaboration and also due to the strict division of labor they had between writing instrumentation and vocalization. Eno only provided a few vocal demos and suggested simple changes like adding an extra verse. Byrne made minimal changes to the instrumentation on several tracks and avoided changing chords in the melody to suit his singing style. The duo only worked in the studio together on two occasions, including one full week and a weekend on another occasion and neither partner got a veto in the process of track selection or production. According to Byrne, the main challenge in this writing technique "was more emotional than technical: to write simple heartfelt tunes without drawing on cliché."
He later explained, "In a nutshell, Brian wrote most of the music, and I composed most of the vocal melodies and lyrics, and then sang them." If Byrne's vocal harmonies were radical enough, Eno would revise the instrumentation to accompany it, but Byrne avoided writing instrumentation and chose to adapt to the instrumentals as written. Using a style similar to the Talking Heads album "Speaking in Tongues", Byrne scatted and murmured some lyrics before they were completed and Eno also contributed some vocal harmonization he credits as "inhuman piano" due to Byrne's preference for the sonic quality of lyrics rather than their literal meaning and his method of writing lyrics using free association. In composing lyrics for the album, Byrne attempted to write keeping in mind what would please Eno as his collaborator. He also attempted to write harmonies for Eno, who decided against singing on the album.
Both musicians continued to work on their own projects during the composition of "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today". Byrne of "Big Love" and completed his collaborations with Fatboy Slim on the album and musical "Here Lies Love" and the single "Toe Jam". Eno produced Coldplay's "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends" and U2's "No Line on the Horizon". Byrne and Eno discussed the former's collaboration with Fatboy Slim and Chris Martin of Coldplay wrote lyrics to the instrumental track for "One Fine Day", but acquiesced when he heard Byrne's version (the band would also adapt another one of Eno's instrumental compositions that Byrne did not finish into a track on "Viva la Vida"). Once Byrne's version of "One Fine Day" was finished, the two began in earnest writing the rest of the tracks. Byrne initially had a long delay in writing material, but as the project progressed, he got to working several hours a day on the album and put his collaboration with Fatboy Slim on hold to finish the songs in the early part of 2008. Since the two did not work together face-to-face as they had in the past, it was harder for them to complete material quickly, and they had to rush to complete two of the tracks were finished at the end of the sessions. He later described the process as easy once details were sort out and summed up this method as "pure joy" and declared writing collaboratively to be easier than writing solo. He even credited the time between their last collaboration and the transatlantic distance as a strength, since it allowed the two to keep their own schedules. Eno agreed, as it gave him time to focus on a small piece of music without holding up Byrne's progress. Byrne later used a similar approach through 2010 and 2011 in collaborations with St. Vincent ("Love This Giant") and Will Oldham (the soundtrack to "This Must Be the Place".)
Themes.
The two were inspired by Gospel music and both have described their music as "electronic Gospel"—in particular the tracks "Life Is Long" and "One Fine Day". In addition to subtle Biblical themes in the lyrics, Eno was influenced by Gospel musicality, which he initially discovered through Talking Heads while working on "More Songs About Buildings and Food" by listening to "Surrender to His Will" by Reverend Maceo Woods and The Christian Tabernacle Choir. For several years leading up to this project, Eno had primarily listened to Gospel music—even joining a Gospel choir—and was attracted to the music's unrestrained vocals and lack of pessimism as well as its inclusive nature. Eno had been thinking about Gospel for several years, but could not write lyrics to hopeful songs.
While Byrne considers the music "like any contemporary gospel record that you would hear out there," it is "informed by that feeling and those kind of lyrics, which allude to hope in the face of despair." Eno also considers the album "something that combines something very human and fallible and personal, with something very electronic and mathematical sometimes." The music combines electronic and Gospel influences to "make that picture of the human still trying to survive in an increasingly complicated digital world... It's quite easy to make just digital music and it's quite easy to make just human music, but to try and make a combination is sort of, exciting, I think." Tracks such as "My Big Nurse" combine apocalypticism and comfort, blending hopefulness and despair.
The instrumental demos were primarily written in major chords, which Byrne considered slightly "ominous" and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics ended up being hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers "optimism in spite of the dread." The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged over the course of a year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" for instance, "The River" is about the effects of Hurricane Katrina. He has also cited the political climate of the Iraq War, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the George W. Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from Adelle Lutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from what I would have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.
Eno has also said the album is about "painta picture of the human trying to survive in an increasingly digital world" and Byrne considered his job as lyricist to "bring more humanity" to Eno's instrumentals, which can be "cold and academic." Themes of humanity struggling with technology are apparent on several tracks and Byrne has characterized the "overall vibe" of the album as "We're going to get through this. Humanity will prevail." The lyrical content includes "a sinister inflection" but "many songs feel fairly uplifting and the overall tone is hopeful." Byrne focused on mundane events and attempted to write in a style that was "simple but not corny, basic but heartfelt." His inspiration in writing lyrics for "One Fine Day" was the story of Valentino Achak Deng as told in Dave Eggers' ""—the two are thanked in the liner notes and Byrne had previously performed at a fundraiser for Eggers' 826 Valencia. The story of the Lost Boys of Sudan is emblematic of the spiritual themes of the album as they go through "all kinds of unrelenting horrors, but [are eternally hopeful and even cheerful, in a way that defies all logic." The music on this album also expresses homesickness—a lyrical trend that is apparent in Byrne's work with Talking Heads.
Production.
By March 2008, the duo had recruited Seb Rochford to play drums with Byrne in New York City. Later that month, multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams was enlisted to perform guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio. Abrahams and Rochford would continue working on the tracks in Abrahams' studio through May and their work was e-mailed to other collaborators—Byrne attended one session to play guitar. Other musicians worked with Byrne in New York City and Eno in London, such as frequent Byrne collaborator Mauro Refosco, Eno's daughters Darla and Irial, and Jarvis Cocker of Pulp, who added uncredited guitar in London. The duo attempted to record as much of the music from home studios as possible and played almost all instrumentation themselves, saving the drums and percussion for the studio. In addition to the tracks that were released, the musicians had some other instrumentals that Byrne did not complete.
Speaking at an April 2008 event in New York, Byrne confirmed the release of a new album, calling it a "record of sung songs" in contrast to the experimental music from "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts" and later told the "New York Daily News" that "Brian had written a lot of music, but needed some words, which I know how to do. What's it sound like? Electronic Gospel. That's all I'm saying." Eno also explained the differences between this album and their previous one saying, "his is quite different from "My Life" in that the intention of that album was to not use our voices at all, but instead to find voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is different—these are songs written and sung by David... They go from electronic folk Gospel to quite indefinable areas of music."
Throughout the middle of the year, Abrahams recorded drums at his home studio and Cherif Hashizume recorded more at Cafe Music Studios, while Robert Harder at Harder Sound recorded the drums on "My Big Nurse", "Never Thought", "The Painting", and "Life Is Long". Abrahams collected all of the recordings to have them mixed and Byrne booked tour dates in anticipation of completing the album. Mixing continued through June 2008 in New York by previous Byrne collaborator Patrick Dillett at Kampo Studios, who recorded brass and percussion. They e-mailed the mixes to Eno for final approval and sent the finalized audio to Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound for mastering. On July 28, 2008, details of the album became public knowledge when Byrne posted on his blog that he and Eno had finished the new album and it would be released on August 18. The album website was launched on the same day, with an a promotional video of Byrne introducing the new album.
Design.
The physical releases of the album came with graphics and packaging designed by Stefan Sagmeister with Richard The, Joe Shouldice, and Jared Stone; illustration by Stephan Walter; and production by Gamil Design. Sagmeister had earlier received a Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package Grammy in 2005 for art direction on the Talking Heads' "Once in a Lifetime" box set and also designed the cover to Byrne's "Feelings". This album would also win a Grammy in 2010 for Best Record Packaging and was additionally recognized by "Creative Review".
His inspiration for the packaging was based on the song "Home" and the artwork reflects an urban scene of a house by a roadside; the liner notes provide closeups on the home and the artwork on the Compact Disc is the grass from the lawn. Sagmeister proceeded to create not only an image for the cover, but an entire three-dimensional model for the house, which was later released as the deluxe edition packaging. Upon repeated listenings to the album, he became convinced that there was a sinister element to the setting and provided clues to the "dark edge" of the scene, such as a discarded condom wrapper in the gutter, a man looking out the window with binoculars, and a gasoline canteen in the kitchen.
The deluxe package comes in a tin with a microchip that plays a sound of someone walking down a hallway in the house and slamming a door when the package is opened. The urban themes of the packaging are expanded in this edition, with the album entitled "Stick" and the bonus content "Rock"; discs are designed to look like they are covered in grass. This design of a pixelated, dimetric projection domestic scene has been compared to "The Sims".
Release.
The album was self-released on August 18, 2008, exclusively through the album's website. It was made available there free for streaming and for purchase as a download of <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr>-free <abbr title="MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3">MP3</abbr>s. The duo released the album from other online digital music services starting the following month, including 7 Digital, Amazon MP3, eMusic, the iTunes Store, Napster, and the Zune Marketplace. No record label was involved in releasing the digital format and independent distributors were allowed to handle the physical product, which was released on November 25 as an enhanced <abbr title="Compact Disc">CD</abbr> and a deluxe-packaged CD in a tin.
Formats and release history.
Initially, three distinct versions of the album were released:
In addition, customers are entitled to lossless <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> versions of the album at no extra cost. By mid-December 2008, 12 percent of customers chose to download the FLAC option.
This album is catalogued as the second release from Byrne's vanity label Todo Mundo after ""; copies of the CD were marked CD-TODO-002. The CD was released in Japan with a bonus track—"Poor Boy" (Eno & Leo Abrahams Remix)—and obi strip in November 2008 through Beat Records with catalogue number BRC-218. On February 17, 2009, the album was released on 180-gram vinyl LP as LP-TODO-002.
Singles.
The first single off the album—"Strange Overtones"—was released on August 4, 2008, as a free digital download available only through the album's website. The track has been described as "a song about writing a song" and features thematic elements of humanity versus technology that are explored throughout the album. It was downloaded over 40,000 times within the first three days it was available. In September 2008, Jon Yeo created a music video for the track featuring the paintings of Brian Eno. In May 2009, the song was replaced by "One Fine Day" as a free download to promote the <abbr title="Extended play">EP</abbr> "".
Reception.
Critical reception.
Critical reception was mostly positive; the album has an average score of 75 percent based on 24 reviews aggregated by Metacritic. Positive reviews have labeled it emphasized the pop songcraft on the album, calling it "exceedingly pleasant" ("Billboard") and "vibrant" ("Tucson Weekly".) Writing for the BBC, Chris Jones summed up the album by saying that it would not break any musical boundaries, but listeners will find music that was "intriguingly and, sometimes, maddeningly infectious."
The music has been compared to the tone of alternative rock bands Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, and R.E.M.'s 1998 album "Up". Furthermore, Barry Walters of "Spin" has compared the music to former Eno collaborators U2 and several reviewers have compared the musicality to Paul Simon—especially his 2006 Eno collaboration "Surprise". The vocals have been declared similar to Neil Young; and the arrangement has been compared to The Beach Boys. Although the music was informed by Gospel and digital music, comparisons have been made with genres as diverse as country due to the vocal delivery and old school hip hop. One weakness addressed by several reviewers is the unoriginality of the music, especially in comparison to the duo's previous collaborations.
Contrasting "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today" with "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts", some have found a connection between the two. Reviewers have found similarities in Eno's solo album "Another Green World" and the Eno-produced Talking Heads albums "Fear of Music" and "Remain in Light", as well as "Little Creatures", which was produced by the band. This is partly due to the unique use of technology in the creation of all of the albums associated with Eno. Other commentators have emphasized the differences between the two projects. For instance, "The Age" Bernard Zuel considers these expectations built by the earlier work to be "unfair... and inaccurate." "The Observer" review by Kitty Empire labels this album "conservative" and John Doran of "The Quietus" calls it "less exciting"—"Erie Times-News" reviewer Dr. Rock goes as far as to call it an "antithesis" to "Bush of Ghosts". In particular, the experimental nature of the former has been contrasted with the pop music style of this album and the lack of African beats and world music. Audra Schroeder of "The Austin Chronicle" noted "Thirty years after first collaborating on the Talking Heads, these two don't have to mine the past since there's nothing that remarkable about "Everything"." Francis Jones summed up his review for "Hot Press" by concluding "No boundaries were harmed in its making but "<abbr title="Everything That Happens Will Happen Today">ETHWHT</abbr>" is an album of unquestionably great songs" and Louise Gray of "New Internationalist" declared that, "it's not got the edgy, funky bricolage that characterized the earlier album and nor does it seek that." At the same time, other reviewers have found the break with the experimental nature of "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts" to be positive. Jim DeRogatis from the "Chicago Sun-Times" observed:
Reviews have emphasized the contrast between optimism and foreboding on the album, as well as the struggle of humanity against technology. In addition, several reviewers have noted parallels between this album and Byrne's "Big Love: Hymnal", particularly their common spiritual themes and atmospheric moods. "Resident Advisor"s review also notes the shift in Eno's recordings toward more Gospel vocals. Steve Matteo of "Crawdaddy!" wrote that Eno's production dominates the album, wheres "Filter"s Ken Scrudato considers the album primarily a David Byrne venture. Consequence of Sound's review notes continuity between this album and Byrne's 2004 release "Grown Backwards", while "The Village Voice" has declared this album "more expansive and adventurous" than anything else Byrne has released in decades and Greg Kot of "The Chicago Tribune" wrote that the album features "one of the strongest vocal performances of Byrne's career."
Awards.
The album was nominated for three Grammy Awards—Best Alternative Music Album, Best Recording Package, and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package—on December 2, 2008. On February 8, 2009, designer Stefan Sagmeister won the award for Best Recording Package at the 51st Grammy Awards. The deluxe edition packaging was given a bronze medal by the Art Directors Club. The album was nominated for a Technical Excellence & Creativity Award in the Record Production/Album category.
Several year-end lists included the album amongst the best releases of 2008:
DeRogatis' and Kot's reviews were featured on "Sound Opinions" and the album was also placed on two individual writers' lists for "No Ripcord"s best of the year. Two contributors to "No Depression" included the album on their best-of lists for 2008. "The A.V. Club" commissioned celebrities to give their picks for album of the year and Tim Heidecker chose this album, describing it as "the most interesting and listenable pop record of the year, in my book." "The Fader"s 2008 year in review named this one of the "Top Twelve Albums That We Thought Would Have a Bigger Impact On Our Lives", but later declared the album "career-defining." The publication dedicated their annual icon issue to Byrne in 2009 in part due to the success of this album.
Several songs from this album appeared on "The Village Voice"s Pazz & Jop singles poll for 2008—"Strange Overtones" came in at 60, "Life Is Long" placed 337, "My Big Nurse" was 350, "Everything That Happens" ended up at 748, and "I Feel My Stuff" reached 942. In addition, a vote was cast for "".
Sales figures and chart performance.
Although the artists have not released sales figures, they have indicated that the album was purchased across the globe during the first 24 hours it was available and that the servers hosting the album delivered "several terabytes" by September 6. A report in late December asserted that they had sold "nearly 20,000 downloads." In March 2009, Ian C. Rogers of Topspin Media explained that 20 percent of those who listened to the album streaming chose to purchase it and 30 percent of them included a physical copy of the CD; trends that would hold through September of that year. By October 2008, Byrne explained that they had recouped their losses on the album and that sales had "paid back the recording costs and costs for building the Web site." He would later explain that this business model worked well for established acts as well as smaller bands, due to minimal production and distribution costs. Their business model also allowed them to self-release and plan a tour immediately after finishing the music production, rather than wait months for record label advancement.
The album did not chart until it was physically released—a development which surprised Byrne. In the first week of December, "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today" reached the top spot on the "College Music Journal" <abbr title="Adult Album Alternative">AAA</abbr> charts and third on the <abbr title="College Music Journal">CMJ</abbr> Radio 200. The album entered the "Billboard" 200 for the week of January 17, 2009, debuting at 182 with 4,008 copies sold. It peaked the following week at 174 before dropping off the charts. It was on the Independent Albums chart for 10 weeks, reaching 18.

(Left to right): Eno was convinced in part because of his own preferences for digital music from the iTunes Store rather than CDs as well as the success of Radiohead's 2007 album "In Rainbows" and the self-promotional strategies of Nine Inch Nails for the albums "Year Zero", "Ghosts I–IV", and "The Slip". Byrne was also impressed by Radiohead's release strategy as a means of valuing music. The duo carefully avoided Internet leaks by not giving out promotional copies of the album to journalists, but Byrne did preview the song "One Fine Day" prior to the release by performing it with a choir of senior citizens and Eno invited Mark Coles for the BBC World Service program "The Beat" to his home to listen to the songs on Eno's laptop.
In 2010, several of the songs from this album—"Home", "I Feel My Stuff", "Life Is Long", "My Big Nurse", and "Strange Overtones"—were included in the Todo Mundo to the film "" along with other David Byrne songs.
Marketing.
Byrne and Eno have both expressed their displeasure with the music industry and traditional models of marketing music, with Eno calling the music business an "exciting mess" and saying:
Byrne has written for "Wired", outlining the relative merits of different distribution models with this one reflecting his "self-distribution model" in which "the artist stands to receive the largest percentage of income from sales per unit—sales of anything. A larger percentage of fewer sales, most likely, but not always. Artists doing it for themselves can actually make more money than the massive pop star, even though the sales numbers may seem minuscule by comparison." The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans want more than just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming "I sense that a lot of people don't know we have a record out" and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as "so infinite it's easy for music to get lost out there" and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.
The duo enlisted a music marketing startup company—Topspin Media—to design their site, delivery options for the digital music, and promotional web widgets. Like the entirety of the recording process, the marketing was self-financed and controlled by the artists, with Topspin taking a portion of the money made from digital sales. This allowed the artists to control creative aspects of producing music as well as the overhead costs associated with marketing an album. The company used viral marketing techniques to collect potential customers' e-mail addresses and encourage them to post the album streaming on their blogs. By early November, the collected e-mail addresses amounted to 37 percent of the album sales. Topspin has also created a Flickr pool encouraging users to upload screenshots of the widget posted to web sites. No advertisements were taken out for the album.
Byrne and Eno were praised by "Fast Company" for their innovative use of Internet marketing and distribution for this album as well as several other releases and the promotion of this album has been lauded as a way of undermining copyright infringement. Key to their success was the software that Topspin Media developed and later commercially released as a bundle for other companies and artists to use, explaining that "In the first eight weeks following the launch of the David Byrne and Brian Eno self-released record, "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today", the Topspin platform helped us generate Direct-to-Fan revenue at the very least the equivalent to what we would have expected from a label advance," that went directly to Byrne and Eno. Based in part on the success of marketing this album, representatives of Topspin were invited to teach a course on music marketing at Berklee College of Music in September 2009 and Ian C. Rogers led a panel discussion at South by Southwest on options for independent music artists.
Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour.
Byrne assembled a band to tour for the album, performing music throughout the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 across North America, Europe, and Australasia. He hired more singers than he had on previous tours to reproduce the complex vocal harmonies of the album and was inspired to bring along dancers after seeing Sufjan Stevens promote the album "Illinois" as well as the Japanese films "Funky Forest" and "The Taste of Tea". Byrne was initially uninvolved in the choreography, but made more suggestions as the tour went on and after he saw a live performance by Deerhoof that incorporated dancing with instruments. He began booking tour dates before the album was completed and continued writing his book "The Bicycle Diaries" throughout the tour.
In planning the set lists for the tour, Byrne initially considered only promoting this album but decided to include songs from his previous collaborations with Eno as well, including the Talking Heads albums "More Songs About Buildings and Food", "Fear of Music", and "Remain in Light" and Byrne's "The Catherine Wheel" soundtrack. By playing music from all of their collaborations, Byrne hoped to "draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30 years ago" with the goal of clarifying the connection between all of the duo's previous work. In reviewing their past music, he found that "here might be more continuity than I imagined, which I hope is going to work in my favor." Although Eno was invited to participate and early reports indicated that he would, Eno ultimately chose not to tour with Byrne, letting Byrne decide how to present this music live.
"Everything That Happens Will Happen on This Tour".
On May 11, 2009, the live EP "" was released digitally through Todo Mundo to benefit Amnesty International. The album features four songs recorded in December 2008 on the tour. Topspin Media offered the same digital download options to purchase the EP and the company created a second embeddable media player to promote the album.
"Ride, Rise, Roar".
On February 11, 2010, it was announced that a documentary film entitled "Ride, Rise, Roar" chronicling the tour would be released to the 2010 film festival circuit. The debut was at South by Southwest on March 15, 2010, where it was screened in all three media categories—film, interactive, and music. Byrne attended some British screenings for question and answer sessions.
"Ride, Rise, Roar" is the feature-length directorial debut by Hillman Curtis—Byrne approached him after his satisfaction with the short film that accompanies the deluxe edition of "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today". The documentary includes concert footage, film of the planning and rehearsals for the tour, and exclusive interviews with Byrne, Eno, and the supporting musicians and dancers. Curtis was initially contacted to document the tour with no clear objective for the film and decided to focus on the collaboration between Byrne and his tour mates as well as the unique challenge of combining popular music with modern dance.
Track listing.
All lyrics written by David Byrne; all music by Byrne (vocals) and Brian Eno (instrumentation), except "Strange Overtones" co-written by Leo Abrahams.

Uhura's Song

"Uhura's Song" is a "" novel written by Janet Kagan and published in 1985. Kagan was asked to produce an outline by editor David G. Hartwell, after he read the manuscript of her novel "Hellspark". She was unfamiliar with "Star Trek" and needed to research the series whilst writing the "Uhura's Song". She subsequently wrote two sequels, but they went unpublished as they featured original characters introduced in "Uhura's Song".
Plot.
Lt. Uhura's friendship with a cat-like diplomat from Eeiauo becomes vital when a plague threatens the population. The songs they shared are key to the cure. When the plague begins to infect humans starting with Dr. McCoy, the crew of the "Enterprise" must work to decipher the songs and cure the plague.
Development.
Janet Kagan was first introduced to "" by her younger brother during the original run of the show. She was invited to submit a proposal for a "Star Trek" novel by David G. Hartwell, to whom she had submitted her novel "Hellspark" in his capacity as editor of Pocket Books' original-SF line Timescape; though Hartwell liked the novel, Timescape did not accept novels from previously-unpublished authors – but the "Star Trek" line did, and Hartwell suggested it as an avenue for qualifying as a published author. ("Hellspark" was ultimately released in 1988 by Tor Books, to which Hartwell had moved on in the meantime.) At the time she hadn't seen an episode of the show for some seventeen years. She researched the series, and due to it being shown in broadcast syndication, she was able to record late-night re-runs using her videocassette recorder. She had committed to provide a ten-page outline plus a thirty-page sample to Hartwell within a week, and whilst watching the recorded episodes, she realised that Uhura hadn't been featured prominently and that Nichelle Nichols had never been given any memorable lines.
Kagan did remember Nichols in a NASA promotional film, and desired to "give Uhura the plum role she deserved". She was keen to have the characters sound like a real proposal for a "Star Trek" episode. Hartwell approved the outline, and Kagan reached out to family members and friends for more information on the series such as tapes and books and wanted to know what they had never seen in "Star Trek" but wanted to. She had three months to turn in a first draft, and during that time she watched the entire series. During that period, Hartwell had left Simon and Schuster for Tor Books, and Kagan subsequently wondered how the book would have turned out differently had Hartwell stayed on to edit. A similar Uhura-focused book had been published two books prior, entitled "The Tears of the Singers".
Following the successful publishing of the book, Kagan wrote two sequels to the novel, both featuring her original characters from "Uhura's Song". She submitted it to the new editor once the office had stabilised after Hartwell's departure, but discovered that the policy was that authors were not allowed to bring back original characters from previous books, and so these sequels have gone unpublished.
Reception.
Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer, in an article for Tor.com about the appearances of Uhura in "Star Trek" novels, described the plot of "Uhura's Song" as "undisputably weird". She described the book as an "an epic coming-of-age journey" with "lots and lots of ballads". She did say that she felt that there were numerous Mary Sue-type characters in various guises throughout the book. In "Star Trek: Adventures in Time and Space", published in 1999, "Uhura's Song" was described as one of the two defining novels alongside "The Tears of the Singers" which "gave Uhura the chance to expand her range beyond hailing frequencies".

L. Glenn Perry

Lloyd Glenn Perry (October 28, 1944 - October 21, 1998) was the first Chief Accountant of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. His appointment to this post by Ronald Reagan was announced on September 23, 1982 in the SEC News Digest. 
He led numerous actions against publicly traded companies for false financial reporting and disclosure known as "cooking the books." Most notable of these was the action against California's Financial Corp. of America. After an investigation by Perry and the SEC, the company was forced to re-report second-quarter profits in 1984 to show a $107.5 million loss instead of a $31.1 million profit. This case is credited with being the first indication of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.
He became a recognized expert in policing false financial disclosure and articles written by him such as "Policing Financial Disclosure Fraud: The SEC's Top Priority" are still referenced and used in college accounting text books such as "Accounting Theory" (ISBN 0471189081 LCC: HF5625) edited by Richard G. Schroeder and Myrtle W. Clark and published by John Wiley & Sons.
He was born on October 28, 1944 in Gatesville, North Carolina. He graduated from Churchland High School in Portsmouth, Virginia and was a star baseball player and track athlete. He graduated from Old Dominion College in 1967 and was a member of the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity.
He was Chairman of the Ethics Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
He was a Senior Partner of the accounting firm KPMG retiring as head of the Office of Ethics and Professional Practice. Upon being made a partner in 1976 at the age of 31, he was the youngest person to achieve that in the firm's history at that time.

<doc id="18622970" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18622970" title="Federal Tort Claims Act">
Federal Tort Claims Act

The Federal Tort Claims Act (June 25, 1948, ch. 646, Title IV, , and ) is a 1948 federal statute that permits private parties to sue the United States in a federal court for most torts committed by persons acting on behalf of the United States. The FTCA constitutes a limited waiver of sovereign immunity.
Limitations.
Under the FTCA, "United States [is liable . . . in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but not liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages." . Federal courts have jurisdiction over such claims, but apply the law of the State "where the act or omission occurred." (b). Thus, both federal and State law may impose limitations on liability. The FTCA exempts, among other things, claims based upon the performance, or failure to perform a "discretionary function or duty." The FTCA also exempts a number of intentional torts. However, the FTCA does not exempt intentional torts for "investigative or law enforcement officers," allowing aggrieved individuals to bring lawsuits. The Supreme Court affirmed this so-called "law enforcement proviso" in "Millbrook v. United States", where a federal prisoner was allowed to bring a claim against the United States for intentional torts committed by federal prison guards in the scope of their employment.
The Supreme Court of the United States has limited the use of the FTCA in cases involving the military in the Feres doctrine.
History.
The ""Federal Tort Claims Act"" was also previously the official short title passed by the Seventy-ninth Congress on August 2, 1946 as Title IV of the "Legislative Reorganization Act", 60 Stat. 842, which was classified principally to chapter 20 (§§ 921, 922, 931–934, 941–946) of "former" Title 28, "Judicial Code and Judiciary".
That Title IV of the "Legislative Reorganization Act" act of August 2, 1946 was substantially repealed and reenacted as sections 1346 (b) and 2671 et seq. of this title by act June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 982, the first section of which enacted this title (Tort Claims Procedure).
The Act was passed following the 1945 B-25 Empire State Building crash, where a bomber piloted in thick fog by Lieutenant Colonel William F. Smith, Jr. crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building. As NPR reported, "Eight months after the crash, the U.S. government offered money to families of the victims. Some accepted, but others initiated a lawsuit that resulted in landmark legislation. The Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, for the first time, gave American citizens the right to sue the federal government." Although the crash was not the initial catalyst for the bill, which had been pending in Congress for more than two decades, the statute was made retroactive to 1945 in order to allow victims of that crash to seek recovery.

Strange Overtones

"Strange Overtones" is a song recorded by David Byrne and Brian Eno, written by the duo with Leo Abrahams. It was released on August 4, 2008 by means of free download as the lead single from Byrne's and Eno's second collaborative studio album "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today" (2008). "Strange Overtones" is an uptempo electronic gospel song, and its lyrics explore the themes of humanity overcoming technology that are central to the album. "Strange Overtones" was well received by critics, and was downloaded 40,000 times in its first three days of release.
Recording and release.
While discussing the 2006 remix of "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts" at a dinner party, Eno suggested finishing some songs that he had written but that did not have lyrics. Byrne visited Eno's studio to listen to the demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs. They continued working on the tracks in New York City and London, with regular e-mail correspondence to finish the composition. Multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams performed guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio and played guitar with Byrne on one occasion. Abrahams would continue working on the tracks in his home studio through May 2008, with all collaborations being carried on via e-mail.
"Strange Overtones" is the first single off the album "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today". The track was released for free on August 4, 2008, as a DRM-free MP3 available only through the album's website. This is part of the unorthodox Internet-based marketing scheme the two used to promote the album, inspired by the success of Radiohead's 2007 album "In Rainbows" and the self-promotional strategies of Nine Inch Nails for the albums "Year Zero", "Ghosts I–IV", and "The Slip". In September 2008, Jon Yeo created a music video for the track featuring the paintings of Eno.
A live recording of the song also appeared on ', released on May 11, 2009. The song was also featured on the to ', along with several other David Byrne compositions.
Composition.
Eno has also said the album is about "paint a picture of the human trying to survive in an increasingly digital world;" themes that are explored in this song. "Strange Overtones" has been described as "a song about writing a song"—the subject of the song struggles to write innovative music, but is overheard by a neighbor using beats that are "twenty years old." In terms of the genre of music, both Byrne and Eno have called it "electronic Gospel"—the backing tracks are the kind of electronic music for which Eno is known, paired with hopeful and inspiring lyrics from Byrne— this song in particular features an uptempo backing track. Eno had been thinking about Gospel for several years, but couldn't write lyrics to hopeful songs.
Eno considers the album "omething that combines something very human and fallible and personal, with something very electronic and mathematical sometimes." And they tried to "make that picture of the human still trying to survive in an increasingly complicated digital world... It's quite easy to make just digital music and it's quite easy to make just human music, but to try and make a combination is sort of, exciting, I think." Byrne considered his job as lyricist to "bring more humanity" to Eno's instrumentals, which can be "cold and academic."
Reception.
The song was downloaded over 40,000 times in its first three days of availability. One of the earliest reviews for "Strange Overtones" was on the August 11, 2008, episode of NPR's "All Songs Considered". The "Los Angeles Times" called the track "intimate" and Stereogum echoed this by labeling it "warm"; it also received a positive review from "Rolling Stone".
Pitchfork Media gave the song several adulations, including a positive review in their discussion of "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today" and naming the song number 11 track of 2008—including appearances on eight editors' end of the year lists—and placing number 297 on the Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s. Pitchfork also solicited the opinions of musicians for their favorite albums and songs of the year and The Watson Twins proclaimed "Strange Overtones" one of the best songs of 2008. KCMP's Top 89 of 2009 featured the song on two editor's lists. Mark Wheat of NPR named it one of the top 10 songs of 2009.
Ranking 60th for the year, this song was one of several from "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today" which appeared on "The Village Voice"'s Pazz & Jop singles poll for 2008—"Life Is Long" placed 337, "My Big Nurse" was 350, "Everything That Happens" ended up at 748, and "I Feel My Stuff" reached 942. In addition, a vote was cast for "".

Koreans in Paraguay

Koreans in Paraguay formed one of the earliest Korean diaspora communities in Latin America; however, they were always overshadowed by the larger Korean communities in neighbouring Brazil and Argentina, and since the late 1990s, their population has fallen significantly.
Migration history.
The first Korean immigrants to Paraguay came from Busan on a two-month journey by sea to Buenos Aires and then overland to Asunción, finally arriving on 22 April 1965. Exact numbers of migrants are difficult to calculate because Paraguay offered on-the-spot visas to all foreigners, and did not distinguish between those who came to settle in the country as opposed to those who intended to remain only temporarily; 120,000 Koreans arrived in Paraguay between 1975 and 1990, according to official figures, but many migrated onwards to Brazil, both legally and illegally. Paraguay's 1982 census showed 2,700 Koreans in Paraguay, but this was believed to have undercounted the actual population by as much as an order of magnitude. By 1999, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade estimated that 10,428 Koreans resided in the country, but by just two years later, that figure fell by more than 40% to 6,190.
The population continued to decline after that, though less sharply; , Koreans in Paraguay had fallen to the fifth-largest group of Koreans in Latin America, and 24th largest in the world. Between 2009 and 2011, the population remained roughly stable. Of the 5,205 South Korean nationals or former nationals in Paraguay in 2011, 499 had become Paraguayan nationals, the vast majority (4,641 persons) had permanent residency, 16 were international students, and 49 had other kinds of visas.
Business and employment.
The early Korean migrants who settled in Paraguay engaged in a variety of agricultural and commercial work, including beekeeping and door-to-door sales of imported clothing. By the early 1980s, many were involved in importing consumer electronics as well. Some also opened convenience stores in poorer neighbourhoods; they gained attention for remaining open through the siesta, unlike many of their competitors. The second generation have largely moved away from manual labour or small retail business, and entered into the liberal professions, such as medicine, law, pharmacy, architecture, and accountancy.
Language and education.
Koreans in Paraguay opened their own school in 1972, the Colegio Coreano del Paraguay, to provide cultural and language education to their youth. It is located in the San Vicente neighbourhood of Asunción. A Korean American Presbyterian church opened another school, the Colegio Presbiteriano Cerritos, in Villa Elisa (in the Asunción metropolitan area) in 1992.
Little language shift is observed from Korean-dominance to Spanish-dominance among members of the Korean community in Paraguay, including those born locally; this contrasts sharply with the rapid shift from Korean-dominance to English-dominance among Korean Americans, especially of the second generation. Many Koreans in Paraguay their children to study and universities in the United States and Europe; as of 2007, there were also roughly 100 Paraguay-born Koreans studying at universities in South Korea. They typically view English, rather than Spanish, as the most prestigious and economically important language to learn.
Religion.
Korean Christian missionaries are active among indigenous communities in Alto Paraná department. Korean churches in Ciudad del Este include Jardín del Dios and Iglesia de la Asamblea de Dios.

Once opened to the intellectuals the Royal Library by a decree of 1711, and its real opening in 1712 the Royal Librarian Gabriel Alvarez de Toledo died soon and there were pressures from the Jesuits to get Juan de Ferreras appointed as Royal Librarian. He coordinated the formal royal decrees on the Rules of Use of the Library in 1716, stating that the Director should be the Confessor of the King.
In 1717 and as a consequence of the role played by the Catalans supporting during the Spanish Succession War the Habsburg rulers of Austria rather than the French Bourbons, it was created in Catalunya a new University in Cervera, resulting in the disappearance of the University of Barcelona.
Such new and single University for all the Catalunya territory recruited many Jesuit priests teaching before at the Barcelona Colegio de Cordelles and therefore would be mainly controlled by the Jesuits.
Further, the Seminario de Nobles of Madrid, created in 1727 would be also strongly influenced by the Jesuits. As the Royal Library got as a rule to receive no less than one book printed in Spain since then, the amount of all kinds of information available to such people began to increase exponentially. But this apparent state of things was no useful to the New Dynasty.

Perlasca, un Eroe Italiano

Perlasca, un Eroe Italiano (English: "Perlasca, an Italian Hero" also known as "Perlasca, The Courage of a Just Man") is a 2002 Italian drama about the real-life hero Giorgio Perlasca, who posed as a Spanish ambassador and tricked Nazi officials to save the lives of five thousand Jews during the Holocaust. The "Village Voice" deemed the first-time account "more courageous than Spielberg."
Background.
During World War II, Perlasca worked at procuring supplies for the Italian Army in the Balkans. In the autumn of 1943, he was appointed as an official delegate of the Italian government with diplomatic status and sent to Eastern Europe with the mission of buying meat for the Italian army. On October 8, the American general Dwight Eisenhower announced the unconditional surrender of Italy to the allied forces thus all Italian citizens became the subject of warrant for capture by the Hungarian Government loyal to Germany.
Some of the film’s scenes feature cameos by historical persons these encounters aren't based on fictions but less-known facts, like when Perlasca rescues two children from deportation and certain death right under the nose of Adolf Eichman, “the architect of the Holocaust.” Although it seems like cinematic enhancement, the incident is reported to have actually occurred in fact, under the presence of Raoul Wallenberg.
After the war, the real Perlasca returned to his home in Padua and never spoke about his war-time experiences. For forty-five years his deeds remained a secret.
Plot.
The film starts in a Budapest Hotel with a narrative introduction by Perlasca, which reveals the historical background of the story told. Disturbed by his chambermaid he is warned of the raid of Arrow Cross storm troopers coming up on the stairs to arrest him. He escapes before being caught and manages to get at the railway station where he tries to sneak onto a sheep transport wagon. Discovered by a local officer named Glückmer he is put under arrest but the while being taken away an Allied air strike hits the station allowing Perlasca an opportunity to escape. He arrives to a bourgeois party where he is trying to get in formation from Contessa Eleonora about resistance members ready to help him in leaving the country. Meanwhile another squad of troopers led by captain Bleiber arrive on the scene and arrest some of the party guests but the contessa uses her social rank to elude from the place and sends Perlasca to Professor Balázs who rescues Jews from persecution. Perlasca follows the advise and goes to his clinic where he spends the night but the place is again investigated by Bleiber and his henchman Lieut. Nagy. the Professor evades the clean-up, though the Jews - afraid of being caught the next day - leave the house and subsequently runs into the trap of Bleiber, who is waiting outside and slaughter them with a night raid. Perlasce survives in the confusion with Magda and her daughter Lili. They reach the Spanish Embassy where - thanks to a self-written letter by Francisco Franco - he is granted to speak with the ambassador Sanz Briz. He sends them to a Spanish safe house of Spain's possession thus no Hungarian laws apply in them ("out of territory"). They are accompanied by a local lawyer working for the embassy. There Perlasca meets some refugees from the clinic as well as Eva and Sándor, a Jewish couple and unifies the opposing Jewish parties within the house. He and the lawyer leave the house for s drink but upon his return he recognizes that the house was indeed cleaned up illegally by the Arrow Cross soldiers. He begins searching for Magda first in the railway station where the fascists has already started to gather and load the Jews to wagons ready to roll out. He confronts Glückmer for the second time who helps him instead of putting him in custody. Perlasca is sent to the SS-Führer of the station who is easy to bribe and thus lets him compile a list of Jews needed by the Spanish Embassy. He cheats with the list and actually calls more people to his truck than it is permitted except Magda, who isn't on the train. He then visits an Arrow Cross Interrogation base, where he finds a lot of executed Jews but saves those few who survived the torture with Magde among them. Returning to the Embassy, Briz tells him that they withdraw from Hungary and cease to operate. This is the point where Perlasca decides to take the role of a so-called consul and to lie to be of Spanish nationality and make others call him "Jorge". He refuses to let the Arrow troopers in and acts as if the Embassy would still functioning thus is a neutral territory. He organizes education, alert duty and supplies within these buildings. He visits Gábor Vajna, the Arrow Cross Interior Minister of Hungary as a consul and claim that the Jews housed by the Spanish are Sephardi Jews. Meanwhile Lt. Nagy collects - according to the local rules - the protected Jews to the streets to dump debris caused by air raids. He attempts to escort the group to the railway station for deportation, but is stopped again by a dispatch reporting Perlasca and Vajna's agreement. Then comes the aforementioned encounter with Adolf Eichman where Perlasca saves the lives of two siblings. He then falsifies 5000 'Schutzbriefs' (protection letters) when he is informed of his own Spanish visa waiting for him at the Hungarian border. He still chooses to stay because Magda's life is in danger. A final raid on the safehouse results in Nagy taking all the Jews (except a dozen of them hiding) to the Danube bank, while Perlasca is attending to a ball where he tries to borrow a train wagon for his protégés to be sent to Switzerland. While running away from the safehouse, Magda's father is shot at sight by a young militiaman, who tries to test him by asking to finish the prayer "Our father, who art in ... ". As being Jewish he can not do so and the soldier yells "Where is our father?" while Sándor responds "I don't know where he is" and is shot immediately. Perlasca and the few remained Jews find shelter at the Professor Balázs' flat. At the Danube river the 1944-45 Danube executions take place and despite recruiting Major Glückmer, Perlasca arrives late to the scene. He only manages to save Eva. Upon hearing the news of a preparation of the elimination of the Budapest ghetto and its inhabitants, he decides to convince the Jewish community to take up arms and to fight if necessary. He also has his final visit at Vajna's office and with a successful bluff he convinces him to let the ghetto stay and thus freed by the Red Army days later. At the finals scenes Cpt. Bleiber is seen hung in the street and Perlasca is leaving the city with the help of Glückmer who was originally ordered to arrest him because of his former fascist affiliations.
Reception.
In Italy the film was cut into two episodes to make it a television film. When the premiere of the second part was broadcast it attracted 13 million viewers with a 43% share of TV coverage in Italy.
The "New York Daily News" said:
Zingaretti does a fine job shading a character that is written as an unalloyed saint. But the most touching moments come at the end, when we see documentary footage of his true-life inspiration.
"TV Guide's Movie Guide":
Negrin's film is a well-deserved tribute to a principled man who dared to act when principles no longer counted for anything.
"New York Post":
A well-made and heart-rending Italian Schindler's List.
Awards.
"Perlasca" won Best Actor and the Humanitarian Award at the Ft. Lauderdale International Film Festival, and won best TV Movie Telegatto, in Italy.

Tkuma, Israel

Tkuma (, "lit." Resurrection) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located north-west of Netivot, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 514.
History.
Tkuma was established as a kibbutz on the night of 5 and 6 October 1946 as one of the 11 points in the Negev at a location around a mile from the present site. The first residents were immigrants from Eastern Europe who survived the Holocaust. Its name reflects the resurrection of Israel.
In 1949 the village moved to its present location near the site of the depopulated Palestinian village of Al-Muharraqa. According to Morris, Tkuma is near the Al-Muharraqa site, but according to Khalidi, Tkuma, although only 2 km west of the Al-Muharraqa site, is actually on land which formally belonged to the city of Gaza. 
In the 1950s the moshav was joined by more immigrants from Eastern Europe and Tunisia.
Economy.
Since the 1990s, fish-farming has been an important economic branch. The sale of fresh fish to banquet halls and restaurants in the northern Negev has provided income for seven families.
Terrorism.
Located 5 kilometers from Gaza, and on land belonging to Gaza town, the moshav has suffered damage from rockets launched by Hamas militants.

Pholiotina

Pholiotina is a genus of small agaric fungi. It was circumscribed by Swiss mycologist Victor Fayod in 1889.
Taxonomic details.
The genus "Pholiotina" is defined as small thin "Mycena"-like mushrooms, with an hymenoderm pileipellis, a dry cap surface, cystidia that are sub-capitate to blunt, and spores which are rusty brown in deposit. Spores of mushrooms of this genus are thick walled, smooth and have a germ pore.
Some authors consider "Pholiotina" part of the genus "Conocybe". The two genera can be distinguished microscopically: "Pholiotina" contains a differentiated central zone called a mediostratum that is lacking in "Conocybe". Additionally, "Pholiotina" species have cystidia with rounded to tapered tips, compared to the enlarged, globular cystidial tips of "Conocybe".
In a 2007 publication, Hausknecht and Krisai-Greilhuber devised an infrageneric classification that includes the sections "Piliferae" and "Vestitae", and the series "Aeruginosa", "Aporos", "Appendiculata", "Brunnea", "Coprophila", "Filipes", "Keniensis", "Mairei", "Pygmaeoaffinis", "Resinosocystidiata", "Sulcata", "Teneroides", "Utriformis", and "Vexans".
Species.
"Pholiotina rugosa" is the most commonly known species of this genus, although
in most field guides this species is known as "Conocybe filaris", which is a
taxonomic equivalent.

Colonial Office

The Colonial Office was a government department of the Kingdom of Great Britain and later of the United Kingdom, first created to deal with the colonial affairs of British North America but needed also to oversee the increasing number of colonies of the British Empire.
It was headed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, known as the Colonial Secretary.
"First" Colonial Office (1768 – 1782).
Prior to 1768, responsibility for the affairs of the British colonies was part of the duties of the Secretary of State for the Southern Department and a committee of the Privy Council known as the Board of Trade and Plantations.
In 1768 the separate American or Colonial Department was established, in order to deal with colonial affairs in British North America. With the loss of the American colonies, however, the department was abolished in 1782. Responsibility for the remaining colonies was given to the Home Office, and subsequently (1801) transferred to the War Office.
"Second" Colonial Office (1854 – 1966).
In 1801 the War Office was renamed the War and Colonial Office under a new Secretary of State for War and the Colonies to reflect the increasing importance of the colonies. In 1825 a new post of Permanent Under-Secretary for the Colonies was created within this office. It was held by Robert William Hay initially. His successors were James Stephen, Herman Merivale, Frederic Rogers, Robert Herbert and Robert Henry Meade.
In 1854 this office was divided into two and a new Colonial Office was created to deal specifically with the needs of the colonies and assigned to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Colonial Office did not have responsibility for all British possessions overseas. British possessions in India and certain other nearby areas were under the authority of the India Office, and certain informal protectorates and other areas (particularly Egypt) were under the authority of the Foreign Office. In 1907 the Dominion Division of the Colonial Office was created, and from 1925 separate Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs were appointed. After the independence of India in 1947, the Dominion Office was merged with the India Office to form the Commonwealth Relations Office.
In 1966, the Commonwealth Relations Office re-merged with the Colonial Office, forming the Commonwealth Office. Two years later, this department was itself merged into the Foreign Office, establishing the modern Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
The Colonial Office List.
The office published its own "List"
Earlier versions were known as "The Colonial Office list...'(1862 - 1925)' and the 1926 - 1940 version with a different title.
The distinction between the official "Office list" and the edited Waterlow and Sons publication can be difficult in library catalogue descriptions

Lynemouth power station

Lynemouth Power Station (generally known as Lynemouth Power Station) is a coal and biomass fired power station which provides electricity for the UK National Grid. Until March 2012, it was the main source of electricity for the nearby Alcan Lynemouth Aluminium Smelter. It is located on the coast of Northumberland, north east of the town of Ashington in north east England. The station has stood as a landmark on the Northumberland coast since it opened in 1972, and has been privately owned by aluminium company Rio Tinto Alcan throughout its operation until December 2013, when RWE npower took over.
The station is one of the most recently built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420 megawatts (MW), is now one of the smallest operating. It is the most thermally efficient coal-fired power station in the UK. Two separate wind farm plans currently have permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced that they hope to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. In 2011, it was announced that the power station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. RWE npower have confirmed they are committed to conversion to biomass.
History.
In 1968, Alcan had applied for planning permission for the construction of a new aluminium smelter in Northumberland at Lynemouth. Later that year, Alcan was granted the permission and site preparation would soon begin. However, to meet the electric demand of the new smelter, a power station would also be needed to be built. Therefore, Lynemouth Power Station was constructed only from the aluminium smelter.
The two establishments were constructed in South East Northumberland as part of an incentive to lower the high unemployment numbers. The site was also chosen because of the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries. Ellington Colliery sunk in 1909, with Lynemouth Colliery sinking 18 years later. However, in 1968, the two collieries were connected underground by the Bewick Drift, from which coal was brought to the surface. The Drift had no rail connection, and so coal was sent to the washery at Lynemouth by conveyor belt. The power station was constructed nearby the end of the conveyor belt.
Both buildings were designed by architects Yorke, Rosenberg & Mardall, with engineering consultation from Engineering & Power Consultants Ltd. The power station was constructed by Tarmac Construction and the smelter by M.J. Gleeson Company. Both the power station and smelter were brought into operation in March 1972.
Design and specifications.
The power station is divided into structures, which mainly include a boiler house and a turbine hall. Both of these structures have a steel frame foundation in the walls with aluminium cladding. Other structures include a single tall chimney made out of solid reinforced concrete, and coal delivery and sorting plant.
The station's boiler house houses three 380 MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by pulverised bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam for on of three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420 MW. The electricity generated is fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation which powers the smelter. The substation also has a 132 kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines only require 310 MW of the 420 MW that the power station produces, so it is the excess 110 MW which is fed into the national grid.
Between 1999 and 2000, the power station was given a turbine upgrade. In 2000, the station's condensers were also refurbished. The condenser refurbishment was carried out by Alstom. These improvements saw an increase in the station's generating capacity, thermal efficiency and MWh production.
Operations.
Coal supply and transport.
The power station is the leading coal customer in Northumberland, burning 1,200,000 tonnes of coal a year, with a weekly coal consumption between 25,000 and 27,000 tonnes. The station has relatively limited coal storage facilities, and is only able to hold three to four weeks worth of its fuel.
The station was designed specifically to burn coal from the Northumberland coalfields. The neighbouring Ellington Colliery originally fed coal directly to the power station using a conveyor belt from its Bewick Drift Mine, situated from the station. Within a year of the power station opening, 3,000 men were employed between the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries, producing over two million tons of coal a year, the majority of it being sold to the power station. In 1994, Ellington Colliery connected underground with Lynemouth Colliery, but coal continued to be taken straight to the power station's coal sorting area using conveyor belts. This supply was supplemented by coal from local opencast mines. However, Ellington Colliery was forced to close when it flooded in January 2005. The station burned the colliery's remaining coal stock after it closed, and since then coal has been sourced from opencast mines in Northumberland and Scotland, but now a small amount of import is necessary.
Coal is now delivered to the station mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at the station using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying the station use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the smelter. This line was originally used to export coal from Easington, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines is brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at the station prior to being burned.
With only one significant opencast in the local area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, there is a need for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have too high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.
Water use.
For creating the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming away from the turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that is used in the Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.
Water used in the steam cycle is taken from the local mains water, supplied by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is used in the station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.
Operating close to the power station is a fishing bait company, Seabait. Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow worms four times as fast as in the wild. The worms are used for several purposes, primarily for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, the worms are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in natural habitats.
Ash removal.
Fly ash and bottom ash are two byproducts made through the burning of coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material in the construction industry and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.
Biomass usage.
In December 2003 the Environment Agency granted permission for the plant to co-fire biomass fuels in the station. Since 2004 three different types of biomass fuel been in use at Lynemouth; Sawdust and Wood pellets from FSC certified forests and Olive residues. These fuels are mixed with the coal on the conveyor belt into the power station. In 2004 11,000 tonnes of biomass fuel were used in the station. Because biomass is considered 'Carbon neutral', this represents the equivalent to saving approximately 18,500 tonnes of CO2 by burning this material. Alcan aimed to increase the amount of biomass used in future.
The station earned the world class OHSAS 18001 health and safety certificate in 2003, ahead of Alcan's global targets. All of the station's staff were required to take place in safety audits to improve working practice at the station. The certificate was presented to the station's manager by Wansbeck MP Denis Murphy on 15 March 2003. The station's attention to health and safety was further recognised on 6 June 2007 when they were honoured by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) with a RoSPA Occupational Health and Safety Award at the Hilton Birmingham Metropole Hotel. Workers at the station had been audited by RoSPA for 10 years before receiving the award.
Coastal defence.
In late 1994, the power station was flooded to a foot deep of sea water, after a freak high tide and strong winds. This led to a sea defence system being constructed to protect the building. The problems came about because of the temporary closure of Ellington Colliery. Tipped waste from the colliery had been used as a coastal defence measure, but as the colliery had closed, waste was no longer being tipped. The colliery was reopened by RJB Mining, and in July 1999 the station ensured the future of the colliery by signing a contract with RJB Mining to provided with 3,000,000 tonnes of coal from Ellington Colliery and opencast mines in Northumberland, over the course of three years. The colliery closed again in 2005, leading to problems with coastal defence again, threatening the station's coal stocking area. This required to a £2.5 million new coastal defence scheme be put in place, involving the use of large rocks as a defence wall.
Environmental impact.
The power station's use of biomass since 2004 has been part of an attempt to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) output. In 2002 and 2004 the station met its targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, in 2006 the power station was revealed as having the fourth highest CO2 emissions in the north of England, for producing 2,685,512 tonnes of CO2 per year. However, generally the station reduced it CO2 emissions by 65% between 1990 and 2010, and the local air quality meets UK and European standards.
Windfarms.
In 2006 a proposal was made by Hawthorn Power, an offshoot of UK Coal, to construct three tall wind turbines on an unused part of the station's coal sorting area, north of the power station. Permission was granted for the turbines in February 2008. In July 2010, it was revealed that the project's new developer, Clipper Windpower, would be using the site to erect the country's first super-efficient wind turbines, called Liberty Wind Turbine. However, this meant the height of the turbines would increase from to . Each turbine would have a rating of 2.5 MW, but only three turbines would be built. The wind farm would produce enough electricity to provide power for 1,690 houses. One turbine is expected to be erected initially, while environmental issues are assessed.
ScottishPower Renewables also have permission to build 13 wind turbines near the aluminium smelter. They were initially refused planning permission, which they submitted in November 2006. This was because their site is spread over two council boundaries and Wansbeck Council approved the scheme, but Castle Morpeth refused. An appeal hearing was given in April 2008, and permission was eventually granted in January 2009 for the construction of up to 13 turbines, producing 30 MW of electricity.
Future of the station.
Following a visit to the station by Prime Minister Gordon Brown on 3 July 2009, it became apparent that Rio Tinto Alcan were hoping to be able to demonstrate Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology at the station in the future. However, due to the economic climate, Rio Tinto are not willing to commit the funding for the project themselves, and so are hoping to secure European Union funding available for demonstration of CCS technology. The investment required could be up to £1 billion, but if funding is secured, "pre-combustion" CCS technology would be installed. This would involve treating the coal prior to burning so that less CO2 was produced, with any remaining CO2 being pumped under the North Sea into an aquifer. In November 2009 it was announced that a variety of energy experts were preparing for the £1 billion bid to the Government for investment. The plans include a pipeline into the North Sea, and the upgrading of one of the station's generating sets from 140 MW to around 375 MW, to safeguard the supply of electricity to the aluminium smelter.
Despite these future plans, the station and smelter's futures are under threat. The European Commission (EC) claimed that Alcan is in breach of their operating license as the station has failed to "significantly reduce its emissions". The UK Government contested the allegations, as the power station and smelter combined provide 650 jobs and a contribution of £100,000,000 to the local economy, in an area heavily affected by the loss of traditional heavy industry. They lost the court case over it and on 22 April 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the plant was subject to the emission limit values of the European directive on Large Combustion Plants. As a consequence, the station has to have at least £200 million worth of adaptations made to it so that it conforms to the directive, or be shut down. A date has not yet been given for it to conform, but two options for saving the station are the CCS project, or a switch from coal to biomass as a fuel.
Lynemouth's future came further under threat in March 2011, following carbon cutting measures announced in the 2011 United Kingdom budget. The government's plans meant that the station would cost an extra £40 million a year, erasing Rio Tinto Alcan's profits on the station. This has made the station's operators consider the option of converting the power station to operate on biomass only to avoid the penalties. However, this conversion itself would cost £50 million and then using biomass instead of coal would cost an additional £170 million a year.
Cultural use and visual impact.
Since its construction, the station has made appearances in a small number of films shot locally. These include:
The chimneys of both the power station and the smelter are strong landmarks on the local coastline, and can be seen over a stretch of coast, from Cresswell down to South Shields pier.

Norwood culture

The Norwood culture was a subculture or subperiod of the late Archaic culture. 
The Norwood culture was located in the Apalachee region, a forested and hilly part of what is now north Florida and was typical of other Archaic cultures using triangular-shaped projectile point knives which showed notches for attaching stone implements to shafts. It is widely accepted that Archaic cultures began using hand held spears to atlatls to more effectively bring down animals for clothing and consumption. 
The specific difference between the Norwood and other Archaic cultures was that they were the first people to create and use fiber-tempered pottery of Spanish moss or strands of fiber from the palmetto and decorated by making stick impressions on its outer surface prior to firing. Much of the Gulf coastal shell middens date to this Archaic period however some sites have been covered by rising sea level. Other sites have been destroyed by modern borrowing activities and development.

Laigh Kirk

Laigh Kirk can mean "Low church" in general or the Church of Scotland in particular. Many place names and personal names are also derived from it.
As a common noun, "kirk" is the Scots and Scottish English word for 'church', attested as a noun from the 14th century onwards, but as an element in placenames much earlier. Both words, "kirk" and "church", derive from the Koine Greek κυριακόν (δωμα) (kyriakon (dōma)) meaning "Lord's (house)", which was borrowed into the Germanic languages in late antiquity, possibly in the course of the Gothic missions. (Only a connection with the idiosyncrasies of Gothic explains how a Greek neuter noun became a Germanic feminine.) Whereas "church" displays Old English palatalisation, "kirk" is likely to be a loanword from Old Norse and thus has the original mainland Germanic consonants. Compare cognates: Icelandic & Faroese "kirkja"; Swedish "kyrka"; Norwegian & Danish "kirke"; German "Kirche"; Dutch "kerk"; West Frisian "tsjerke"; and borrowed into non-Germanic languages: Estonian "kirik" and Finnish "kirkko".

Fred Klobedanz

Frederick Augustus "Duke" Klobedanz (June 13, 1871 – April 12, 1940) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball. He played for the Boston Beaneaters in five seasons and had a lifetime major league win-loss record of 53–25.
Career.
Klobedanz, a "hard throwing, wild lefty," began playing semi-professional baseball in 1889, around the age of 17, and then started his professional baseball career in 1892. He played in the New England League for the next few years, mostly with the Fall River Indians.
During the 1895 season, Klobedanz married the former Annie L. Durfee of Fall River. If married life hurt his pitching, then it is not evident from the statistics because that season he won a career-high 28 games, batted a robust .377, and led the Indians to their third consecutive pennant. In 1896, Klobedanz had another good season, going 25–6 with a 2.38 earned run average, leading the league in wins and batting .353. He was then purchased by the National League's Beaneaters that August and pitched well in his first MLB action during the last several weeks of the season.
In 1897, Klobedanz went 26–7 to lead the majors in winning percentage. At one point, he won 14 consecutive games. His ERA was mediocre, but he was aided by the powerful Boston offense which provided league-leading run support; Klobedanz himself batted .324 that season. The Beaneaters won the pennant by two games. In 2004, baseball analyst Bill James wrote that Klobedanz had the second-luckiest pitcher season of all-time. According to James, Klobedanz actually "deserved" a win-loss record of 16–17.
In 1898, Klobedanz had a record of 19–10, helping the team to another championship. He started off slow in 1899, however, and was sold to the Eastern League in May. Besides another short stint with Boston in 1902, he remained in the minor leagues from 1900 to 1908. In 1902, he went 26–10 with a 1.29 ERA for the New England League's Lawrence Colts. His last winning season was 1906, when he went 18–10.
Overall, Klobedanz won 234 games in the minor leagues to go along with his 53 major league victories. He died in 1940, in his hometown of Waterbury, Connecticut.

To Duck or Not to Duck

To Duck or Not to Duck is a Warner Bros. cartoon released in theatres in 1943, directed by Chuck Jones and featuring Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd.
The cartoon has fallen into the public domain, as United Artists (successor-in-interest to Associated Artists Productions) failed to renew the copyright in time. It is found on many VHS tapes of public domain cartoons, with very badly faded colors (in fact, the a.a.p. logo was left intact). It has been fully restored on the "".
It is the earliest-released color "Looney Tune" to have these each of these two distinctions: to fall into the public domain, and to have its original opening and closing titles survive (the two color "Looney Tunes" that preceded it, "The Hep Cat" and "My Favorite Duck", remain under copyright, and were given Blue Ribbon reissues; both have been restored on DVD, but each still feature the Blue Ribbon titles). It is also the first formal appearance of Elmer Fudd in the "Looney Tunes" series, after his voice was heard (but only his voice) in 1942's "Nutty News", and having been exclusive to the "Merrie Melodies" series since his first appearance as Egghead in 1937.
Plot summary.
Elmer Fudd is hunting ducks with his dog Laramore. After missing Daffy several times ("Confidentially, those hunters couldn't hit the broad side of a DUCK!" snickers Daffy to the audience) and leaving a duck-shaped hole in the clouds after each shotgun blast, Elmer manages to graze Daffy with a load of buckshot, merely blowing off his tail-feathers and causing him to fall. After Laramore retrieves Daffy and brings him to Elmer, Elmer apologizes for shooting him, saying that he is "a gweat spoowtsman." Daffy retorts that Elmer wouldn't be so tough without his hunting equipment, and challenges Elmer to a "fair" fight.
Elmer is unaware that he is led to a boxing ring surrounded by many duck spectators. The burly referee of the fight is also a duck. The odds are clearly against Elmer since the referee laughs while announcing his name followed by boos from the crowd, with only Laramore cheering from a separate stand, for which he is knocked down by brickbats thrown at him by the duck spectators. The referee also refers to Daffy as "Daffy "Good to His Mother" Duck.", while announcing his name followed by cheers from the crowd, with only Laramore booing from a separate stand, for which he is again knocked down by brickbats thrown at him by the duck spectators.
Before the match starts, the referee exhorts the two opponents to "fight clean", winking to the audience, who collectively shout, "Oh, brother!", and calls for "no rough stuff -- none of THIS! Or THIS! Or like SO!", each time demonstrating an illegal move on Elmer and knocking him silly. Daffy, in turn, picks up where the referee left off, asking, "You mean none of THIS? Or THIS?", manhandling (or duckhandling) Elmer similarly every time. Daffy clobbers Elmer with a hammer as the bell is rung. Elmer falls to the mat and the referee provides a quick ten-count. He declares Daffy the winner and new champion. Perplexed, Elmer protests, "I'm not the one to compwain, Mr. Wefewee, but I thought you said no wough stuff! none of THIS! Or THIS! Or wike SO!", giving it back to both the referee and Daffy in extreme exasperation.

Neutra Office Building

The Neutra Office Building is a office building in the Silver Lake section of Los Angeles, California. The building was owned and designed by Modernist architect Richard Neutra in 1950. It served as the studio and office for Neutra's architecture practice from 1950 until Neutra's death in 1970. The building has been declared a Historic Cultural Monument and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was listed for sale in 2007 at an asking price of $3,500,000.
Richard Neutra.
Architect Richard Neutra (1892-1970), a native of Vienna, Austria, moved to Los Angeles in 1925 to work with Rudolph Schindler on Frank Lloyd Wright's Barnsdall Park project. In 1929, Neutra became famous in his own right with the completion of his landmark Modernist Lovell House in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles. Over the next 20 years, Neutra became one of the recognized innovators and leaders of Modernist architecture.
Construction and architecture of the Neutra Office Building.
Neutra built the Silver Lake office building in 1950 to house his own architectural practice. Neutra designed the building with his son, Dion Neutra, acting as project architect and Red Marsh as the contractor. The one-story office building includes two reception areas, two conference rooms, and a large open office space. The building also includes two residential units with an enclosed garden at the rear of the building. The building has been carefully preserved by Neutra's son, Dion Neutra. Many original built-ins and design details remain intact, including custom strip lighting, acoustic tiles, exposed ducting, operable louvers, and blue Aklo glass.
Operation as Neutra's design studio.
The building has been called "a piece of L.A. history since most of (Neutra's) L.A. buildings were probably dreamed up in this very office." Jay Platt of the Los Angeles Conservancy has said of the building's significance, "The real importance of the office is that it provided the creative environment in which Neutra produced all of his now famous homes." In fact, his early works pre-date the building, but it was in this building that Neutra designed many of his landmark buildings, including the U.S. Embassy in Karachi, Pakistan, the Los Angeles Hall of Records, the Gettysburg Cyclorama Building, the Orange County Courthouse, and the Huntington Beach Public Library. The building remained the site of the Neutra architectural practice even after Neutra's death in 1970—as Dion Neutra continued the practice at the site until the 1990s.
Historic designation.
Known mostly for his residential designs, the Neutra Office Building in Silver Lake is Neutra's only surviving commercial structure with Neutra's original design. The Neutra web site describes the building as "the only surviving example of Neutra commercial design that is still intact." Marketing materials for the building call it "a pristine example of the work of one of the seminal architects of the Modernist movement" and "the "only" remaining example of Neutra commercial design, still with its original look." The building was designated a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #676) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 2000 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.
Listing of the building for sale in 2006.
After 56 years of being owned by the Neutra family, Dion Neutra listed the building for sale in November 2006 at an asking price of $3,500,000. The sale was conditioned on the buyer accepting a protective conservation easement, which Dion Neutra considered essential to prevent his father's work from disappearing. He told the National Trust for Historic Preservation: "I'm hoping to find a suitable steward while I'm alive that would take care of the building into the foreseeable future." The marketing brochure compared the building to works of art by Gustav Klimt and Jackson Pollock and went so far as to say: "The purchase of this icon would be equivalent to acquiring the last remaining Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece." One critic wrote of Dion's "delusional price comparison of his father's office building to the paintings of Klimt & Pollack." As of July 2008, after 20 months on the market, the Neutra web site continues to list the building for sale.

Lex building

The Lex building is a high-rise of government offices in the European Quarter of Brussels (Belgium). It is an annex building of the Council of the European Union (its main building is the Justus Lipsius building) and is located at Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat 145.
History.
Work began in 2001, with construction starting in 2004 when the old building was demolished. It was finished in 2006. The building was built and is owned by the Lex 2000 company, with the Council having long term rent on the building and the option to buy. Due to the increase in office space, Lex 2000 has had to finance renovation of nearby apartments to compensate.
It is built on the site of a private mansion, similar to the neighbouring Résidence Palace which was demolished instead of renovated in order to create a much larger modern building. Extra space for the EU institutions were needed in time for the 2004 enlargement of the European Union. The existing building, Justus Lipsius, could not be extended due to residential areas and the protection of Residence Palace, thus Lex became a new project to satisfy the need for more office space.
The first plans were submitted in 1988 by the company which built Espace Léopold, however they were deemed too ambitious by the local authorities. It was intended to be tall, serving as a gateway into the area together with the Charlemagne building opposite. The authorities demanded a reduction of 20 metres, giving it 15 floors instead of the planned 20, in order to preserve the visual dominance of the Berlaymont building and the Cinquantenaire arcades.
Features.
There are three basement floors for technical services - though the car park was built with less than 200 spaces as it was deemed the public transport links compensated for lack of car parking spaces. The main entrance has direct links to the metro and rail stations with the ground floor being occupied by a large restaurant. The building's glass structure is intended to convey transparency, with two floors being cleared to give a more open feel inside.

Raj Bhavsar

Raj Bhavsar (born September 7, 1980) is an American artistic gymnast. He was a member of the 2001 and 2003 World Championships U.S. team. He earned a bronze medal as a member of the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team, becoming the third Indian-American ever to medal at the Olympics, after Mohini Bhardwaj and Alexi Grewal. He was originally an alternate, but was named to the team following the injury withdrawal of Paul Hamm. At the Games, Bhavsar earned a bronze medal with the U.S. team in Artistic Gymnastics with teammates Alexander Artemev, Joey Hagerty, Jonathan Horton, Justin Spring, and Kai Wen Tan.
He was a contender for the 2004 Olympic Team, and was named as an alternate.
Biography.
Bhavsar is the son of Jyotindra and Surekha Bhavsar. He was born in Houston. He was raised in Greater Houston and attended Bear Creek Elementary, Wolfe Elementary, Mayde Creek Junior High and Mayde Creek High School. During this time he trained at Cypress Academy of Gymnastics under his coach Bill Foster.
Bhavsar was a member of the United States team to the 2001 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships and won the silver medal with the team. He won a second silver medal at the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.
At the 2004 Olympic Trials, he was in contention for the U.S. Olympic Team. He was named as an alternate. In 2004 he was first in the rings in the trials, and fourth overall in the national championships, yet was passed over. In 2008 he was third in the Olympic trials and the Visa Championships and again wound up an alternate to the 6-man team. This was due to the fact that his strongest events overlapped with those of Paul Hamm and Morgan Hamm, and the team needed gymnasts who were stronger in other disciplines. After Paul Hamm was injured, Bhavsar was selected to the team which earned a bronze medal.
He attended Ohio State University and won the NCAA title with that team. He won the All-Around at the 2002 NCAA Championships.
Bhavsar is the creator of two new gymnastics elements, which are now named after him. "The Bhavsar" on the still rings was created in 2003. It is a front lever start with movement into a final position called a Maltese. "The Bhavsar" on parallel bars was created and performed in 2009 at the Moscow World Cup. This is a tkatchev style release move starting on one end of the bars and finishing on the other.
After obtaining his goals as an Olympic gymnast, in 2010 Bhavsar started working for Cirque du Soleil as an artist for their performance show Iris which debuted in July 2011.

<doc id="18623510" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18623510" title="Newropeans">
Newropeans

Newropeans is a European political party running for European Parliament elections in all European Union member states simultaneously. It therefore claims to be the first truly pan-European political party. As opposed to other European parties such as the European People's Party or the Party of European Socialists, the Newropeans are not an alliance of pre-existing national political parties.
History.
The party was founded by Franck Biancheri in June 2005 when the referendum on the constitution failed. Biancheri had previously founded the European Students' Forum (AEGEE) in 1985 and a thinktank called "Leap2020" in 1998.
Policies.
Newropeans call for increased democratisation of the EU. They want an elected Union government, the ratification of changes to EU treaties by referendum and a unified immigration policy. Its programme is also in favour of decentralisation and restructuring of the institutions which are mainly concentrated in Brussels, but also spread among Strasbourg and Luxembourg. The party wants to ground the European Union Budget on a direct tax instead of contributions by the treasuries of member states, and opposes the lifelong judicial immunity granted to EU officials. According to the official website, the party focuses mainly on reform of the EU system, and has currently little agenda beyond that.
Pre-election activities.
Like all newly established political parties, Newropeans works to gain attention, money and members. As stated in their manifesto, Newropeans has to establish itself in all EU members before the election in 2009. A "Democracy Marathon" has been launched in 2007, holding meetings in cities of all the 27 countries.
In the summer 2008, the Newropeans Summer Beach Campaign took place, promoting Newropeans on European beaches (in Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, ...).
Structure.
As it is currently impossible for a pan-European party to participate in European Parliament elections, national subsidiary parties of Newropeans need to be created in order for the Newropeans to stand for election. Little is known about the number of national subsidiary parties of Newropeans currently registered. The following overview lists the subsidiary parties currently known.
Germany.
Newropeans needed to collect at least 4,000 signatures to be able to stand for election in Germany. The party announced on 14 April 2008 that it had collected 4,359 signatures, which were handed over to the Federal Returning Officer in Wiesbaden on 31 March. Formal recognition that Newropeans is registered for the election in 2009 was given on 10 April.
According to Newropeans, Germany is the second country in the EU in which the Newropeans have secured a place on the ballot.

Zoome

The name is a combination of "zoom" and "me", and means "My broadcasting station
& community". zoome supported H.264/MPEG-4 AVC for the first time by a video hosting service in Japan, which is the best picture quality and tone quality currently available of Japan. The site is the second largest video hosting service in Japan, after Nico Nico Douga.
The site was called a "CGM video hosting site" and "The third force" different from YouTube and Nico Nico Douga.
Features.
These functions are all free for the zoome user, unlike Nico Nico Douga.
History.
zoome was launched by ACCA Networks on January 30, 2007. However, zoome was overshadowed by Nico Nico Douga, which was launched at the same time, and zoome lurked in an unremarkable state until the end of the year.
zoome's popularity boomed via Hatsune Miku at the end of 2007. Nico Nico Douga, the fostering site of the voice synthesis software, became involved in a scandal which caused some of its members to move to zoome. Dwango, the owner of Nico Nico Douga, had registered the copyright of a Hatsune Miku song to the copyright management group JASRAC under the name "Dwango", without permission from the song's author, sparking outrage among Vocaloid fans. Sometime before the scandal broke out, ACCA had opened a Vocaloid video hosting circle , which was officially recognized by Hatsune Miku's developer, Crypton Future Media. The scandal on Nico Nico Douga and the official recognition in zoome lured many members away from Nico Nico Douga to zoome. As a result, Hatsune Miku videos became one of the mainstays of zoome, and zoome became a leading competitor able to challenge Nico Nico Douga's monopoly of the video hosting service industry in Japan.
In addition, events of 2008 greatly aided zoome in its development. Stage6 was closed and the majority of the Japanese Stage6 users migrated to zoome. Also, zoome continued to benefit from various happenings within Nico Nico Douga, particularly worthy of note is when Dwango announced the complete purge of anime MAD Movies from Nico Nico Douga in July. Many creators of MAD Movies moved to zoome because of this announcement.
On June 2, 2008, the zoome site split from ACCA Networks and became its subsidiary, zoome Co., Ltd. On July 21, 2011, zoome announced that it would shut down all its services on August 31, 2011.

Khanhoo

Khanhoo is a non-partnership Chinese card game of draw-and-discard structure which may be as old as "T'ienkeu" ("Heaven and Nines"), revised in its rules and published in an authorized edition by Emperor Kao Tsung in 1130 AD for the information of his subjects. Meaning "watch the pot", it is very possibly the ancestor of all rummy games.
Adapted to the western taste by Sir William Henry Wilkinson, British sinologist and Consul-General in China and Korea in the mid-1890s, it belongs to the same family as Mahjong and the mid-nineteenth century Mexican card game Conquian, whose name probably derives from the Chinese card game "Kon Khin."
History.
Terminology.
Khanhoo, "Kanhǔ" (Pinyin: 看虎) or "Kanhú" (Pinyin: 看湖), seems to have its roots derived from a term in Mahjong, being Hu (和) a state where a player has a certain combined set of Mahjong tiles that turns out to be victorious. Winning is called hú (胡) in Chinese. Kanhu, which is phonetically related to Khanhoo, is one of the games with the terminological component Hu, there being many other games with the name Hu. The card games Mohu poker (默和牌) and Penghu poker (碰和牌) also bear the same terminology.
Evolution.
Although Kanhu may be a simplified derivative form of Mǎ diào (马吊牌), Dohu, also known as Kanhu, was one of the gambling games during the Ming Dynasty. The game of Mǎ diào, also known as the "Paper tiger," played with a 40-card deck and four flowers called "Shiwanguan," "Wanguan," "Suozi," and "Wenqian," not only emerged and prevailed during the Ming Dynasty, but also waned in the early Qing Dynasty. Despite the fact that there were over 30 revisions on the Great Qing Legal Code, which banned the game of Mǎ diào in 1740, the card players ignored the officials and the law code, and like this the game was slightly modified into another called Peng He Pai (碰和牌), as the number of cards doubled to 120 so that the set could then be played in the form of "Kan" (3 consecutive numbers), "Peng" (3 identical pieces) and "Gand" (4 identical pieces). 
Although the game of Mǎ diào is widely considered to be the first card game in Chinese history, researchers in the subject contradict this theory by saying that Yezixi (叶子戏), of the Tang Dynasty, is the first one. But this is again denied by other researchers seen that the game of Yezixi is asserted not to be based on paper cards, but instead on some other materials like bamboo. It has four derivatives: Dohu (斗虎) (Kanhu) (看虎), Che Zhang (扯张), Mo He Pai (默和牌) (Mohu) and Peng He Pai (碰和牌) (Penghu). Both games, Penghu and Mohu, flourished during the Qing Dynasty, so that the game of Kanhu may probably have emerged after the beginning of Qing Dynasty and later evolved into the game of Mahjong, although this cannot be substantiated.
Chinese version.
Suits.
Known to the Chinese laborers as "Káan ú", the game is played by two or more persons with one complete pack of one hundred and twenty cards. The three suits in the deck are: 
The three extra cards, which correspond more or less closely with the joker of our Euchre pack, are called: 
Meldings.
In the Chinese version of the game the following triplets are called "ngán" (eyes):
A winning hand must contain at least one of the above combinations called "eyes" and the remaining cards must be arranged in one or more combinations called "pát tsz" (boys), a sequence of three or more cards of the same suit, or three cards of the same rank. All aces, the red flower, white flower, and old thousand, may be added to these "eyes", to the sequences or triplets to form a winning hand. The dealer is chosen by drawing a card from the pack and counting the players up to the number of the card drawn. The dealer deals the first card to himself and fourteen others to each of the players, so that in the end he has fifteen. As this is the number needed for a winning hand, and the dealer alone has this number, he is the only player with the chance to win on the cards dealt to him. Either he wins or discards one card to the player on his left who now has gythe chance to take that card or buy one from the stock to see if he wins or discards. The third player then has his turn of play and so on. The first to show a winning hand composed of "eyes", sequences and combinations, wins the game, usually played for money bet in a pot.
English version.
In 1891 Sir William induced the card maker Charles Goodall to issue a special pack of cards with accompanying booklet of rules to play Khanhoo. The deck contained two sets each of Ace through Nine of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds, with two specially-designed Jacks, Queens and Kings standing in for the "extra cards" and two Jokers. As the years passed, his passion for the game became so great that in his last books he was designated as William "Khanhoo" Wilkinson, as published in a collection of fascicles issued in Portugal and Brazil in 1997. 
The Chinese game from which Sir William got his inspiration is called "Káan ú" and seems to have been widespread in China in the second half of the nineteenth century. In China it is played with four 30-card decks of "money cards," also called "kun p'ai," or "stick cards."
Deck of cards.
The "kun p'ai" pack can be adapted from two English 52-card decks, removing all cards ♠, except for the J's ♠, Q's ♠ and K's ♠, and the 10's, J's, Q's, K's ♦, ♣, ♥. Add one Joker and a Khanhoo 61-card deck will have been formed.
Game play.
Distribute fifteen cards one by one or in batches of two or three to each player and stock the remaining cards face down to the table to form a stock pile. In turn, the first player draws, melds if possible and discards one face up to the table to form a waste pile. Then the next player draws, melds if possible and discards one to the table. 
If a thrown card suits any of the players, it must be melded immediately so that all the other players can see why that player needed that card. But if a player draws a card from the stock pile, it needs not to be shown until he is able to lay all his cards at once.
The aim of the game is to get rid of all cards by melding them. The first player to do so is granted 5 points and the first to reach a pre-agreed number of points, such as 50 or 100 points, wins the match, which can be achieved in two, three or more rounds of games.
Scores.
In a game of less than 5 players, the best possible hand would score 29 points (besides 5 for full hand): Double Khanhoo (15 points), any Double Triplet (10 points) and any one of the Royal Groups (4 points) equals 29 points.
The smallest possible score would be 2: Two sequences of 9 and 6 cards or two of 8 and 7 cards respectively. Though sequences score so little they are of great use in filling a hand. Not only does a long sequence take up a large proportion of the 15 cards, but a sequence of more than 3 cards is exceedingly useful, as either a card can be thrown away in order to declare full hand, or used in a triplet, without spoiling the sequence.
Settling.
At the close of a game players may pay or receive the difference between their scores, as at Skat. Thus if A wins with 52 when B stands at 49, and C and D at 47 each, A receives 3 from B and 5 each from C and D, or 13 in all - B 2 each from C and D, 4 in all, less his 3 paid to A, or a net sum of 1. C and D pay in all 7 each, 5 to A and 2 to B, receiving nothing, as they tie for last place. Points may be anything, from counters to bank notes.
Penalties.
The penalty for a misdeal is to be deducted from the dealer's score or added to that of each of his opponents, at the option of the latter. Dealing out of turn is not considered a misdeal, nor is the exposure of a card while dealing. In the former case the rightful dealer may claim the deal at any time before the first card is dealt; in the latter, the player whose card is exposed may call for a new deal.
In a three-to-four-hand game, a player calling "bump" may be challenged by any of his opponents to show his cards, and if the cards shown would not make a trick with the card thrown, 5 points are taken from his score or added to the score of each of his opponents, and the elder hand which effected the bump may take the trick into his hand as though he had not gained it by bumping. The cards shown by the offender are not, however, considered exposed and may be used to form tricks.
Strategy.
Khanhoo is not only a game of chance, depending on the distribution of the cards or the sequence in which the cards are being drawn. It is also a game of skill and expertise, specially in a two-handed game.
Variation.
A variation of the game can be played by using three decks comprising 90 cards, plus two Jokers to form a new sequence of meldings. 
Features.
There are only three suits in the deck: Nine cards from Ace through Nine, six Courts and one Joker (One Joker in a 2-hand game or two in a 3-hand game), which can replace any card.
Only the A ♥, 2 ♣ and the 3 ♦ may be used to form a Khanhoo, and only the 7 ♦, 8 ♣ and the 9 ♥, with their respective Courts, may be used to form a Royal Group.
Players cut for the deal, the lowest card winning. Each player receives fifteen cards dealt one at a time or in batches of two or three. The player sitting left of the dealer receives one extra card and has the privilege of leading first. Where the number of players is 4 or 8, the player who cuts the highest card may, before the cards are dealt, elect to go "orphan". In this case he receives six cards dealt one at a time. Should he happen to be the original leader, he will receive an extra card making seven in all.
The game of Khanhoo moves clockwise.
All discarded cards are placed face upwards on the table in order of rejection, so that the previous-last card is covered by the last one played. When the stock is exhausted before a full hand is declared, the heap of rejected cards is turned over, so as to face downwards on the table, forming a new stock then.
In a game for three players the possession of a thrown-out card may be claimed by the third player seated to the right of the player who discarded that card, once he can meld it immediately, after which the game proceeds in the order of play. If four or more players take part in the game, two or more players may request the throw-out card once their meld, except for a "sequence", scores higher than any other, having preference to the card the player in the order of play sitting left to the player who discarded that card. This action is called "bump" because one of the players is bumped by another.
The four-hand game can also be played with one complete pack of 120 cards, plus one Joker. If five or more play, up to five Jokers may be added, each additional one increasing the element of chance in the game. The game proceeds exactly as in the case of three players. 
When four or more players take part in the game, the highest card may elect to go "orphan". There will be then a stock of nine cards left. The game proceeds exactly as with three players, except that there are now two or more players who can bump, instead of one. But for the first and second players, either the third, fourth or the other players in the order of play may claim this privilege, the fourth player being subjected to the third and the third to the challenge of the second. The superior trick, declared in number of points, gets the bump in whomsoever hand it may be, although with equal combinations the elder hand has the first right to bump in the order of play.
The following additions to the number of possible tricks may add an interesting feature to the game:

The Story of Stuff

The Story of Stuff is a short polemical animated documentary about the lifecycle of material goods. The documentary is critical of excessive consumerism and promotes sustainability.
Filmmaker Annie Leonard wrote and narrated the film, which was funded by Tides Foundation, Funders Workgroup for Sustainable Production and Consumption, Free Range Studios and other foundations. Free Range Studios also produced the documentary, which was first launched online on December, 2007.
The documentary is being used in elementary schools, arts programs, and economics classes as well as places of worship and corporate sustainability trainings. By February 2009, it had been seen in 228 countries and territories. According to the "Los Angeles Times" , the film had been translated into 15 languages and had been viewed by over 12 million people.
Contents.
The 20-minute video presents a critical vision of consumerist society, primarily American. It purports to expose "the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues, and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world." The video is divided into seven chapters: "Introduction", "Extraction", "Production", "Distribution", "Consumption", "Disposal", and "Another Way".
The video divides up the "materials economy" into a system composed of extraction, production, distribution, consumption, and disposal. To articulate the problems in the system, Leonard adds people, the government, and corporations.
Leonard's thesis, "you cannot run a linear system on a finite planet indefinitely" is supported throughout the video by statistical data. Although the video itself doesn't give attribution to her information, the producers provide an annotated script that includes footnotes with explanations and sources for some of her assertions:
Leonard also quotes what Victor Lebow said in 1955 regarding economic growth:
Reaction.
"The Story of Stuff" has been subject to public discussion, especially after "The New York Times" published a front page article about the video on May 10, 2009. The American Family Association says that the video is anti-consumer, and even anti-American because the video implies that Americans are greedy, selfish, cruel to the third world, and "use more than our share." Glenn Beck, host of the Glenn Beck TV program on Fox News, characterized the video as an "anti-capitalist tale that unfortunately has virtually no facts correct." Beck's website used a detailed critique made by Lee Doren of the Competitive Enterprise Institute in his "How the World Works" YouTube channel. FoxNews.com said that "some of the scariest figures" cited "are misleading or just plain wrong." 
Even before "The New York Times" article, "The Sustainable Enterprise Fieldbook" pointed to "The Story of Stuff" as a successful portrayal of the problems with the consumption cycle, and says it is an engaging attempt to communicate circular economics. Ralph Nader called the film "a model of clarity and motivation." John Passacantando, Executive Director of Greenpeace, called it a "mega-hit on three levels".
Libertarian and politically conservative critics have characterized the documentary as misleading left-wing propaganda; one Montana school board opposed the screening of the film in a biology classroom in a 4–3 vote. The subsequent public outcry against this decision led to a rewrite of the school board's policy and an award for the teacher who screened the film.

Love Point, Maryland

Love Point is the name for the northernmost tip of Kent Island, and as such, marks the southern point of the mouth of the Chester River. It has served as a major ferry terminal, the western terminus of the Queen Anne's Railroad, and the nominal western terminus of Maryland Route 18 (which is aligned in a north/south direction near Love Point). Two notable landmarks once stood at the Love Point area; the Love Point Light and Hotel Love Point, both of which are completely destroyed. Today Love Point is primarily a residential area.
Name.
Love Point's name dates back to at least 1694 and is often explained in local legends. Most of these legends are variations of the same basic story where two lovers die either at Love Point or in the nearby waters. Depending on the specific variation, the lovers are either Native American, European settlers, or one of each. In many versions of the story the couple's love is forbidden, and this is what leads to their death. Another element present in some versions is that their bodies are found washed ashore in an embracing position.
An unrelated explanation states that sailors going up the Chester River had to luff their sails as they rounded Love Point due to a strong northwesterly wind. According to this explanation, the point came to be known as "Luff Point" and over the years the name changed to "Love Point".

Barony of Bonshaw

The Barony of Bonshaw, previously known as Bollingshaw, was in the old feudal Baillerie of Cunninghame, near Stewarton in what is now North Ayrshire, Scotland.
The History of Bonshaw.
The Irvines and Boyds.
William Irvine (c.1298) (also known as William de Irwin) was a clerk in the royal chancellery and protégé of Bernard, Abbot of Arbroath and Chancellor of Scotland; he was granted land in Aberdeenshire in 1323 by Robert the Bruce for faithful service. This grant included a defensive work known as the Drum Tower, thus William became the first Laird of Drum. The family had previously held the lands of Bonshaw and took their name from the village of Irvine in Annandale. 
An Irvinehill Farm is still to be found near Kennox which may relate to this family name or may simply signify that a good view of Irvine is to be had from this eminence. Alexander Smith (died 1938) and his spouse Robina Robb (died 1959) farmed Irvinehill in the mid 20th century and were buried in the Stewarton cemetery.
The Bonshaw barony and estate originally included Bonnyton, Hutt, Moorhead or (Girgenti), Sandielands, Bogflat, and Bankend as well as High and Laigh Chapelton. 
Bonshaw, formerly Bollingshaw, Bonstonshaw, or Bollynschaw, was a small estate and Barony of the Boyd's, a cadet of the Boyds, Lords of Kilmarnock.
In 1482, James, Lord Boyd, was granted the lands of Bollynschaw, Chapelton, Crevoch, and others, reserving the tenement of the lands to his mother, Mary, Lady Hamilton.
A daughter of the Bonshaw family, Margaret Boyd, was a mistress to James IV and her bastard son, Alexander Stewart, became Archbishop of St. Andrews. She later married John Mure of Rowallan Castle. In 1592 Robertson records that Barbara Lawson, daughter of John Lawson owned the lands of Bonshaw and that by the 1690s they were in the hands of the Dundonald family, the Cochranes, the mansion house now being in utter ruins. A Charter of sasine under the Great Seal of Queen Anne was issued to the successors of the deceased Alexander Cochrane of Bollingshaw on 20 March 1706. The mansion house has been long demolished and all that remains are the entrance gateposts, an ice house and possibly the Moot hill and justice hill.
The first OS maps show the horse mill outside the detached building in front of the farm and stepping stones across the Glazert on a path running up to Crossgates. The later map shows what appears to be a small lake with a total re-arrangement of the formal gardens from the previous map.
Alexander Reid and the Hutt Knowe.
Near to the existing farm is the Hut Knoll or more commonly Hutt Knowe (Huit is a 'stack' and Knowe is a 'knol' or low hill), also known as Bonshaw or Bollingshaw Mound, 17 m in diameter and 2.7 m high, variously described as a mounded corn-kiln or lime kiln, but unlike any other known example in the region. 
Corn-drying kilns were often built into sloping ground or existing mounds. It has large integral basal stones and was described in 1890 as having culverts or 'penns' in its sides, although these are not visible today. A dwelling by the name of 'Hutt' existed at this location in the 1740s.
In 1828, Alexander Ferguson Reid inherited the estate, he was known as the "Ayrshire Genius" and was an inventor and collector of antiquities, as well as geological and natural history specimens. Reid dug into this Druidical Mound or Moot Hill several times and found nothing to help explain its age or purpose. Most maps do not show the ice house which lies to the east of the driveway and some confusion in the descriptions may have arisen from misidentification of the ice house, limekiln and the Hutt Knowe. In the grounds of the present farm are curved ditches which are shown to have held water, either as ornamental ponds or for some practical purpose now unknown. The site had an apple orchard within the last 50 years or so, for John Hastings remembers raiding it.
Given that Bonshaw was the 'seat' of the Bollingshaw Barony it is likely that in addition to any other uses the two mounds of Hutt Knowe and Knockenlaw were respectively the Moot hill and justice or Gallows hill of the barony, where the laird would exercise his right of 'pit and gallows' until 1747 when the right was abolished as one of many measures linked to the 1745 Jacobite rebellion.
Isabella Montgomerie of Dalmore House married Robert Reid of Bonshaw (b 1827, d 1887).
Dr. Duguid's visit to Bonshaw.
Dr. Duguid in a work of fiction visited 'Bonnshie', circa the 1840s and lists some of the items in Reid's collection, including garden seats made of bog-oak from Auchentiber Moss, his grandfathers Ferrara sword with which he fought at Drumclog, the first winnowing machine and teapot in Stewarton, devices for catching robbers, etc. etc. He had the stirrups from the horse that the Earl of Eglinton was riding when he was shot and killed by the gauger Mungo Campbell. The 'Hut Knoll' is described as a 'humplock', built by the 'wee Pechs' or by Druids. 
In a small planting is described the place where Alexander Watt, a Jacobite participant in 1745 rebellion, hid his silver when he was forced to flee to Ireland. Duguid comments that it is said that Reid has "A fouth o'auld nicks nackets (nick-nacks)" and that Captain Francis Grose himself (the author, artist & historian, and friend of Robbie Burns) was envious of the collection.

George Adolphus Schott

George Adolphus Schott (also referenced as George Augustus Schott) FRS (25 January 1868 – 15 July 1937) was a British mathematician. He is best known for developing the full theory of radiation from electrons travelling at close to the speed of light.
Born in Bradford to German parents, he was educated at Bradford Grammar School and later studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving his Bachelor of Arts in 1890. After obtaining his Doctor of Science he became assistant lecturer to D.M. Lewis in the Department of Physics. After a years leave, in which he travelled to Germany, he became lecturer of Applied Mathematics at Aberystwyth University, where he would spend the rest of his career. In 1910 he became Chair of the Applied Mathematics department and finally vice-president of the college.
During Schott's early years at Aberystwyth he published his classical work on electromagnetic radiation, which follows the work laid down by Alfred-Marie Liénard. It was not until 1947 that the blue light observed near synchrotron particle accelerators, called 'synchrotron radiation', was recognised as the radiation Schott predicted. In 1909 he was awarded the Adams Prize and in 1922 became a Fellow of the Royal Society.
Schott remained one of the last respectable ‘anti-quantum’ scientists, opposing the quantum formalism introduced by Nils Bohr. In 1933 he published the nonradiation condition of a wobbling charged sphere.

The Screwball

The Screwball is the seventh animated cartoon short subject in the "Woody Woodpecker" series. Released theatrically on February 15, 1943, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures.
Plot.
A local crowd gathers at a baseball park for a game between the Droops and the Drips. A lone policeman stands at the park gate discouraging spectators who have not paid to see the game. Woody notices that kids returning baseballs can get in for free, so he tosses the policeman a cannonball and enters the park.
Woody tries to watch the game but the policeman finds him. He escapes by shaking a soda pop bottle and spraying it into his adversary's face, adding "No stopper, Copper!"
Woody joins the game as the pitcher for the Drips. When he is up to bat, he causes so much trouble that the entire team chases him along the baselines while the policeman waits for him at home plate. He escapes by pecking his way through a barrage of baseball bats. However, Woody ends up not getting away with murder, being assaulted with a barrage of baseballs as soon as he pops out of the park's scoreboard.
Production notes.
"The Screwball" is set at a baseball park. It would also the last onscreen credit for director/animator Alex Lovy on a Woody cartoon for 12 years. He would direct one more entry ("The Dizzy Acrobat") before departing the studio.
Cultural references.
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game" can be heard in the background score during the establishing shot of the baseball park. The music is used sporadically throughout the film.

Hanley Grange

Hanley Grange is the name given to an eco-town planned for land north of Hinxton in South Cambridgeshire. Initial proposals for 8,000 homes rising to 12,800 homes were published.
The site proposed to be developed is on Grade 2 agricultural land, owned in part by a development company, Jarrow Investments, which works closely with supermarket giant Tesco.
Local opposition through the Stop Hanley Grange Group of Parish Councils, is focussed on lack of infrastructure, overbuilding already in Cambridgeshire, and the proposal that the development of the eco town concept on such a scale is best dealt with through an alternative scheme at Northstowe, north of Cambridge.
The petition launched against the Hanley Grange plan was signed by Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond on 18 May 2008 at the Red Lion Pub at Hinxton, Cambs.
On Wednesday 16 July 2008, a significant landowner, the Wellcome Trust announced it was not proceeding with the Hanley Grange eco-town proposal. On 24 July 2008, Tesco, through their agent Jarrow Investments, said they intend to continue with an application for an eco-town on 264 hectares under their control. Revised plans provide for 6,500 houses.

Belvedere Vodka "Date Rape" Controversy.
On 29 March 2012, Packard filed a lawsuit against Moët Hennessy, makers of Belvedere vodka for misappropriating her image by including it in an online ad campaign; the image was taken from a short online comedy video, "Awkward Moments: The Baby Picture," produced by Strickly Viral Productions. In the context of the ad, the appropriated image depicts the character portrayed by Packard as trying to escape the clutches of what appears to be a sexually aggressive man; Belvedere added the tagline, "Unlike some people, Belvedere always goes down smoothly." Packard's filing also alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress, claiming that the repercussions of being associated with the ad "have been huge." While the ad appeared only briefly on March 23 and was removed shortly thereafter, with Belvedere brand president Charles Gibb issuing a public apology subsequent to the ad's retraction, as of the lawsuit's filing, neither the brand nor the parent company had offered an apology to Packard for either the misappropriation or any of the subsequent negative fallout. Packard's lawsuit was filed under California Civil Code § 3344, the so-called California Celebrities Rights Act of 1985, which prohibits unauthorized use of personal images or likenesses for promotional purposes.

Fred Chittick (April 5, 1868 – August 24, 1917) was a Canadian ice hockey goaltender for the Ottawa Hockey Club from 1894 until 1901. He was also a track and field athlete and a rugby football player.
Playing career.
Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Chittick first joined Ottawa HC of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) for the 1895 season, taking over from Albert Morel as the starting goaltender. He played seven seasons for Ottawa, before retiring from play after the 1901 season, the season in which Ottawa won the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (successor from AHAC) championship. He would stay in the game as a referee.
In 1899, Chittick quit the Ottawas over a series of events. On January 21, Chittick was refereeing a game between Quebec and Montreal when the Montreal team quit the game, incensed at the rough play of Quebec and the fact that Chittick was allowing the rough play. After the game, allegations were made by the Montreal players that Chittick was drunk. Chittick was mad enough to threaten the Montreal players with defamation lawsuits. A month later, on February 11 in Montreal, Chittick gave up 16 goals, the worst showing by a senior goaltender to that date. Chittick was replaced for the next game and he quit in anger. He later spoke to the press about the club paying its players to pay, causing a scandal. He would not be the club's regular goaltender again, although he did play a game for the club as a replacement in 1900.
Chittick was employed as an accountant in the Canadian Department of Agriculture at the annual salary of $950 in the 1890s. He died at his Ottawa home in 1917.

<doc id="18624040" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18624040" title="Conservative talk radio">
Conservative talk radio

Conservative talk radio (or right talk) is a talk radio format in the United States devoted to expressing conservative viewpoints of issues, as opposed to progressive talk radio. The definition of conservative talk is generally broad enough that libertarian talk show hosts are also included in the definition. The format has become the dominant form of talk radio in the United States since the 1987 abolition of the Fairness Doctrine. 
Conservative talk radio includes personalities, both local and nationally-syndicated, such as Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, Mark Levin,and many others. As of 2013, Limbaugh and Hannity were the most listened-to radio programs of any format in the United States, and other conservative talk shows also rank highly. Conservative talk is heard almost entirely on commercial radio; public radio in the United States has historically been perceived as having a more liberal lean, and noncommercial community radio is generally very progressive in ideology.
Although other countries such as Canada and Australia also feature prominent conservative talk hosts, the idea of conservative talk radio as a national movement is predominantly an American phenomenon.
History.
Early years.
Notable early conservatives in talk radio ranged from commentators such as Paul Harvey and Fulton Lewis (later succeeded by Lewis's son, Fulton Lewis III) to long-form shows hosted by Bob Grant, Alan Burke, Barry Farber and Joe Pyne. (Farber remains on the air as of 2012, albeit in reduced capacity because of his age.) Because of the Fairness Doctrine, a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) policy requiring controversial viewpoints to be balanced by opposing opinions on air, conservative talk did not have the hegemony it would have in later years, and liberal hosts were as common on radio as conservative ones. Furthermore, the threat of the Fairness Doctrine discouraged many radio stations from hiring controversial hosts.
By the 1980s, AM radio was in severe decline. Top 40 radio had already migrated to the higher fidelity of FM, and the few remaining AM formats, particularly country music, were headed in the same direction or, in the case of formats such as MOR, falling out of favor entirely. Talk radio, not needing the high fidelity that music does, became an attractive format for AM radio station operators. However, in order to capitalize on this, operators needed compelling content.
The AM revival.
In 1987, the FCC abolished the Fairness Doctrine, and AM radio began to make changes. The changes paved the way for syndicated personality Rush Limbaugh and others like him to rise to prominence by "offering a voice for the 'silent majority'" that he believed had gone unheard by the mainstream media (Which he nicknamed the 'Drive Bys'). Helped by a syndication arrangement that was financially appealing to local stations, conservatives like Limbaugh began to take over the airwaves.
The rise of conservative talk radio.
Syndicated talk radio rose in popularity due in part to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which facilitated the consolidation of radio stations into large conglomerates (Clear Channel Communications rose to become a major figure in talk radio in the United States; although it only owned one major "flagship" caliber radio station (KFI/Los Angeles), Clear Channel owned a large number of key AM stations in other large markets, allowing it to establish a national presence). With multiple large-market stations now owned by a small number of companies, syndicated programs could be disseminated more easily than before. During the late 1990s, political talk radio (other than Limbaugh) was still only a portion of the talk radio environment; other subgenera such as lifestyle talk (Laura Schlessinger), truck talk (Bill Mack, Dale Sommers) or paranormal talk (Art Bell's "Coast to Coast AM") and general interest apolitical interviews and talk (Jim Bohannon, Joey Reynolds) made up a typical AM talk station's lineup.
The popularity of conservative talk radio led to attempts to imitate its success with progressive talk radio in the mid-2000s, led by the launch of Air America Radio. Air America did not have the success that conservative talk had, due in part to weaker stations and talent that was inexperienced with the radio medium. Air America ceased operations in 2010. As of 2012, conservative syndicated talk shows far outnumber their progressive counterparts; while usually only one progressive talk channel can be found in most markets (with Dial Global the predominant syndicator), at least two and often three conservative talk stations (one local, the rest mostly syndicated) can be found.
Future.
Demographic age pressures also affect conservative talk radio, as the most established talk hosts have increased in age as have their audiences, pushing the listenership into an older, less advertiser-friendly demographic. Recent Arbitron polls have shown that the vast majority of conservative talk radio station listeners are 54 plus male with less than 10 percent of the listener base 35 to 54. It is also shown that less than one tenth of one percent of conservative talk radio listeners participate (or call in) to the hosts to make comments. Most mid and small market talk radio is made up of hosts that were once music radio deejays. 
The controversial nature of political talk radio also exposes hosts to boycott campaigns against their advertisers, such as the one instigated as a result of the Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy. Most high-profile hosts are protected against lost revenue through long-term contract payments from the syndicator that employs them.

Earl Wentz

Earl Wentz (March 22, 1938 - November 15, 2009) was an American pianist, composer, and musical director most noted for his creation in 2000 of the American Composer Series, an ongoing performance series in the cabaret format.
Early years.
Wentz was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. He received his education at Wingate University, Queens College, the University of North Carolina, and through extensive private studies. Among his early teachers was concert pianist Winifred MacBride. He began his professional career at the age of 12, working as a pianist. By 15 he was also a professional organist, and thereafter added actor, singer, director, conductor, arranger, composer, and teacher to his impressive résumé.
Career.
Wentz composed the 1987 opera "A Minuet", based on the play of the same name by Louis N. Parker. His "Requiem", a one-hour work for four soloists, full chorus and orchestra, composed in 1989, drew the following comment from the opera star, Teresa Stratas: "God bless you. I loved it! It is a wonderful work. You have a tremendous gift."
The American Composer Series paid tribute to the greatest composers of popular American music on the American scene, particularly those composers associated with Tin Pan Alley and the American Songbook. From 2000 to 2009, under the direction of Wentz, the American Composer Series created 15 original revues, many of them returning for multiple runs over the years. Composers saluted in the series include Milton Ager, Harold Arlen, Nacio Herb Brown, Hoagy Carmichael, Sammy Fain, Ray Henderson, Victor Herbert, James V. Monaco, Richard Rodgers, Jule Styne, and Harry Warren. In 2006, the producers of the series broke the format somewhat for two performances to pay tribute to the series’ founder in “An American Composer Series Special Event.”
His credits include guest appearances with the Nashville, Charleston, Glenn Miller, and Jan Garber Orchestras and at such varied venues as the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, the Greenbrier, and the United Nations. He has been featured on college lyceum programs and community concert series from coast to coast. In the 1960s, Wentz toured widely with singing team Doraine and Ellis as their accompanist.
Beginning in 1993, Wentz was the organist and choirmaster at John Street Methodist Church in New York, the oldest Methodist congregation in America. He also taught and coached vocal technique privately.
Among his recent compositions were the score for the controversial 1997 Off-Broadway musical "The Marital Bliss of Francis and Maxine."
In October 2008 and April 2009, Wentz was guest artist for The Green Salon, a monthly program of The Global Change Foundation.
Death.
Wentz died on November 15, 2009 in Charlotte after an "extended illness".
Recordings in Print.
Among Wentz’s CDs currently in print are "The Piano Stylings of Earl Wentz: Traditional Christmas Favorites", "Vampin’ Lady: The Music of Milton Ager", with vocalist Joyce Moody, and "Visions of What Used to Be", a collection of popular songs from the World War I era, featuring vocals by Helen Breen. The first of an anticipated four-volume set of Cole Porter music, "What Is This Thing...?: Earl Wentz Plays Love Songs of Cole Porter", was released in March, 2012.

4-NEMD

4-NEMD is a potent sedative drug which acts as a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. It is closely related to dexmedetomidine but is several times more potent. Like other alpha-2 agonists, it produces sedative and muscle relaxant effects but without producing respiratory depression. It is not currently used in medicine but has been researched as the basis for a potential new generation of alpha-2 agonist drugs, which may have selectivity for the different subtypes of the alpha-2 receptor. It has two isomers, with the (S) isomer being the more potent, as with medetomidine. 4-NEMD was also investigated by the United States military as an anaesthetic agent, most likely for use in surgery but possibly also for use as a non-lethal incapacitating agent.

Amoria (gastropod)

"Amoria" is a taxonomic genus of medium sized predatory marine gastropod in the family Volutidae. 
Distribution.
"Amoria" are found in onshore and offshore waters around the entire coast of Australia. Several species extend into offshore waters of southern Indonesia. The highest areas of diversity are in the intertidal and shallow subtidal waters of northern Western Australia followed by the subtidal waters around the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland.
Shell description.
"Amoria" have a small, smooth, more or less pointed conical protoconch, a solid very glossy, fusiform shell and an elongate aperture with 4 distinct, more or less developed columellar plicae. The sutures are slightly callous. The colour pattern of the genus "Amoria" is variable, the base colour is white, yellow or pink with varying degrees or brown axial lines forming a pattern over the base colour. Axial lines may be free or may reticulate to form a tented pattern. 
The largest species "Amoria hunteri" reaches over 200 mm in length. The smallest species is probably "Amoria dampieria" frequently around 20 mm.
Biology.
"Amoria" are nocturnal and predate on other gastropods and on bivalves. They generally inhabit areas with well sorted coarse sand. Some "Amoria" species have been noted to bite people when they are handled. The bite is followed by a mild sting but no long term effects have been noted.
Fossil History.
The first "Amoria" appear in the Eocene and Late Miocene from Victoria. Judging from anatomical features, "Amoria" are close to the genus "Cymbiola" from which they descended in the Tertiary. "Cymbiola" are related to Tethyan species of the Late Miocene of Indonesia, Java.
Taxonomy.
"Amoria" includes 20-30 species. The following species have been recognized:
Many subspecific names have been created in the genus "Amoria" to distinguish colour variations in the shells of the species.

List of earthquakes in Guatemala

Earthquakes are relatively frequent occurrences in Guatemala. The country lies in a major fault zone, known as the Motagua and Chixoy-Polochic fault complex, which cuts across Guatemala and forms the tectonic boundary between the Caribbean plate and the North American plate. In addition, along Guatemala's western coast line, the Cocos plate pushes against the Caribbean plate forming a subduction zone known as the Middle America Trench, located approximately 50 km off Guatemala's Pacific coast. This subduction zone led to formation of the Central America Volcanic Arc, and is an important source of offshore earthquakes. Both these major tectonic processes have generated deformations within the Caribbean plate and produced secondary fault zones, like the Mixco, Jalpatagua, and Santa Catarina Pinula faults.
The most destructive earthquake in recent Guatemalan history was the 1976 quake with a magnitude of 7.5 Mw and a hypocenter depth of just 5 km. This shallow-focus earthquake, originating from the Motagua Fault, caused 23,000 fatalities, leaving 76,000 injured and causing widespread material damage. Surprisingly, the 7.9 Mw earthquake of 1942, though higher in magnitude, was much less destructive, in part because of its substantially deeper hypocenter depth of 60 km.
A number of earthquakes with low magnitudes caused major damage in very localized areas, which may in part be explained by their relatively shallow depth. This was the case with the 1985 Uspantán earthquake of 5.0 Mw with a depth of 5 km, which destroyed most buildings in the town of Uspantán, but caused little or no damage in the rest of the country.
Recent earthquakes.
Guatemala is in constant earthquake activity. However, there are some earthquakes that are more notable due to the damage they've caused. Notable earthquakes in recent Guatemalan history include the following:
M = Moment magnitude scale, unless stated otherwise
MM = Intensity on the Modified Mercalli scale

Nocoroco

Nocoroco is the site of a Timucuan village located on the Tomoka River, in Tomoka State Park. The park is located two or three miles north of Ormond Beach, Florida on North Beach Street.
History.
Approximately seven thousand years ago, during the Archaic Period, indigenous people found plentiful fish and shellfish at this site in the shelter of a barrier island to the east. The site was inhabited approximately twelve hundred years ago by the Timucuans, whose descendants were discovered there by Europeans. Alvaro Mexia visited Nocoroco in 1605, just as European acculturation had begun. Mexia's expedition explored down the east coast of Florida at the behest of the Spanish governor. This late St. Johns period site represents one of the last Timucuan strongholds in northeastern Florida. All that remains today of these native peoples are the shell middens, which help modern archaeologists document their lives. 
The British occupation began in 1763 when Great Britain received Florida from Spain in a trade. The site of the village of Nocoroco was part of a British land-grant called Mt. Oswald, held by Richard Oswald. His plantation grew indigo and rice. After its return to the Spanish in 1783, the area was likely cultivated until many plantations were destroyed near the beginning of the Second Seminole War in 1835.
Site Archeology.
The midden at Nocoroco is mainly composed largely of a black earth accumulation, with pockets of shell and a few larger shell accumulations. The midden differs from most common middens in the region, which are mostly shell. Shell types include "Ostrea Virginica, Venus Mercenaria, Tagelus Gibbus, Arca (sp.), Donax Varabilis, Modiolus Plicatulus, Busycon Perversum, and Murex Fulvescens." Animal bones were not preserved well and typically were quite fragmentary. Among mammals, the most prevalent source of food seems to have been deer, but other types of bones, such as fish, turtle and alligator remains, were all present.
NRHP listing.
On May 7, 1973, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a site significant for its information potential in the area of aboriginal history.
Present day.
Today the site of the village of Nocoroco is marked by a large fountain sculpture, called the "Tomokie Fountain", created by Frederick Dana Marsh. The fountain is Marsh's artistic interpretation of the legend of Tomokie, whose arrogance in drinking from a sacred spring was paid for with his life and those of all his band. According to information at the site, references to the legend date back more than one hundred years.

Maken-ki!

Plot.
Takeru Ohyama has enrolled at Tenbi Academy, a high school that converted from all-girls to co-ed. Hoping to have a life full of ogling pretty girls, he reunites with childhood friend Haruko Amaya, who shows him around school. However, he learns that the school is for students who possess magical and spiritual energies called Elements and who wield crafted weapons known as Makens. The students engage in school sanctioned combat matches that showcase their powers. While his own ability and Maken is not apparent at first, Takeru soon finds himself surrounded by girls, including Inaho Kushiya, an attractive girl who says she's his fiancée, and Kodama Himegami, a popular blonde who says she wants to kill him. He joins the , also known as Maken-ki, which supports the student council's operations.
Characters.
Takeru Ohyama.
Years before the series' present, Takeru's family dojo is challenged by Tesshin Kushiya when Takeru is ten years old. After witnessing the death of Atsuma at the hands of Tesshin, Takeru has resented his father and uncle for not being around to protect them. As a result, he tends to take the girl's side whenever a girl fights a guy. His abilities originally manifest in extreme situations as in the case where he protects Azuki. When he defends Kodama, he uses Blood Pointer, which is later described as absorbing Element from the people around him through his mouth. Following the battle with the Venus unit, he undergoes extra training with Minori in order to try to control and to increase his powers. Takeru later learns that he is blood related to Kodama's brother and father.
Takeru was one of the three students that Gen's Element Detector, Keronbo, could not initially identify, but a month later, he gets his Maken, Overblow, which causes his target's Maken to overflow with Element and be rendered useless "like a car engine that blows out". However, it can have the opposite effect, and empower the opponent with an evolved Maken if the opponent can perfectly control or contain the surge.
Takeru is voiced by Tomoaki Maeno, and English dubbed by Ian Sinclair.
Haruko Amaya.
Haruko is voiced by Noriko Shitaya, and English dubbed by Monica Rial.
Kodama Himegami.
Kodama's hobbies include shopping, especially for lingerie and rare stuffed animals. When on night patrol, she is attracted to a rare King Penguin stuffed animal, and is captured by the Finnian twins of Venus. She later shows a fear of ghosts and spirits outside her own magic; in one instance she is frightened by a ghost story that Haruto Kirishima admitted that he had embellished.
Kodama later reveals that she has extraordinary abilities. In the battle with Venus, Kodama uses her Maken to summon larger spirits that are as powerful as the Eight Maken. The spirits can only be matched by strong fighters such as Minerva or Minori She attracts the interest of the Kamigari, who have seen her as a key to unleashing the power in Amanohara. She was kidnapped by the Venus unit, and Ouken orders the Kamigari to capture her on the summer training island, where she confronts Kamigari members Leo and then Hakuto. Ouken reveals that Kodama is not human and is older than she appears to be. She is the daughter of Yatsune, the former Yamata no Orochi, and Oousu no Mikoto, the first prince of the Yamato court. When their family is attacked by Oousu's brother, Yatsune and Oousu sacrifice themselves to defend Kodama and her brother Yabiko.. Yabiko then seals Kodama, who has inherited her mother's powers, away on top of Mount Amanohara. Many years later, after her seal is weakened by Minori, Kodama uses her element to manifest an incarnation of herself. She realizes that Takeru Ohyama is related to her brother and father.
Kodama is voiced by Sayuri Yahagi and is English dubbed by Chloe Ragnbone
Venus.
Venus is a mercenary unit that joins Tenbi Academy with the mission to search for the person who is trying to revive Yamata no Orochi. It is headed by Akaya Kodai, a former member of Maken-ki, and consists mainly of high school aged girls. It is later revealed that Venus has ties to the Kamigari organization, and thus serve as the antagonists for a storyline where they plant barrier stones throughout Tenbi, capture Kodama under the pretense that she trespassed into the Amanohara, and challenge Maken-ki to rescue her. The Venus unit uses Jingu, which are equipment used by the gods of their Western homelands; they are comparable to the Maken weapons used by the gods of the East.
Kamigari.
The Kamigari are a secret organization that works with the government by using the Elements and Maken. They originally gathered young people who possess special abilities to their organization, usually against their will. Those who opposed had their memories wiped. This continued until the government created Tenbi Academy to train the students. As a result, they partner with Tenbi in selecting students to join their organization. After Venus leaves Tenbi, they continue their experiments by possessing people and growing monsters to attack the Maken-ki members during their summer training activities. Ouken later decides to go after unlocking the secrets of Amanohara.
Media.
Anime.
An anime adaptation was announced on "Monthly Dragon Age"s official website in December 2010. In April 2011, "Monthly Dragon Age" confirmed that the anime series will air on television. Produced by AIC under the direction of Kōichi Ōhata with Yōsuke Kuroda as script supervisor and music by Cher Watanabe, the anime series will begin its broadcast run on October 5, 2011. The anime series has been licensed by Funimation Entertainment in North America. A cast announcement was made on August 30, 2013, and the complete first season is planned for release on November 12.
Reception.
Andy Hanley of UK Anime Network, in reviewing the first five episodes, found little originality in the anime series, which he called: "a cavalcade of tired old tropes and plot devices, from a visit to a hot springs to a 'date' where the couple are spied on by jealous friends, extending all the way out to the show's various characters and beyond." He gave it a 3/10 and summarized it as "A lazy, generic fan service series that has nothing of worth to offer beyond glimpses of female underwear.

August Leskien

August Leskien (July 8, 1840 – September 20, 1916) was a German linguist active in the field of comparative linguistics, particularly relating to the Baltic and Slavic languages.
Biography.
Leskien was born in Kiel. He studied philology at the universities of Kiel and Leipzig, receiving his doctorate from the latter in 1864. He taught Latin and Ancient Greek at the from 1864-1866. In 1866 he began studying comparative linguistics under August Schleicher at the University of Jena. He completed his habilitation in 1867 and went on to lecture at the University of Göttingen.
He was appointed as the extraordinary () professor of comparative linguistics and Sanskrit at Jena in 1868. Two years later he was named as the extraordinary professor of Slavic philology at the University of Leipzig, where he delivered the first course there in Slavic languages. He was promoted to full () professorship in 1876 and remained in the position until 1915.
In 1884 he became an editor of Ersch and Gruber's "Realencyklopädie". Leskien was a founding member of the journal "". He died in Leipzig.
Research, writings and thought.
Leskien was a central figure in the group of linguists at Leipzig who later became known as the Neogrammarians. The group strove to approach linguistics in a scientific manner; Leskien formulated their main doctrine, namely that phonetic laws have no exceptions ("Ausnahmslosigkeit der Lautgesetze"). Leskien's hypothesis was that phonetic shifts do not occur randomly or haphazardly, but instead are the product of directly observable conditions. Among the students that Leskien taught are: Jan Niecisław Baudouin de Courtenay, Ferdinand de Saussure, Leonard Bloomfield, Nikolai Trubetzkoy, Karl Verner and Adolf Noreen. Thus Leskien can be seen as a key founder of modern comparative linguistics, particularly in the fields of Baltic and Slavic languages.
In his 1881 essay ", Leskien formulated Leskien's Law, a sound law devised to describe a particular aspect of sound change in the Lithuanian language. According to this law long vowels, along with the diphthongs "ie" and "ou", with an acute intonation are shortened in the final syllable of a word. Leskien is also the author of "", a guide to Old Church Slavonic (3rd ed. 1898). Although superseded in places by more recent studies, the book is still in print and remains in use by scholars to the present day. With Karl Brugmann, he edited "Litauische Volkslieder und Märchen" (“Lithuanian Folk Songs and Tales”; 1882).

Home with Kids

Home with Kids (; pinyin: Jiā yǒu érnǚ), is a sitcom/drama from Mainland China. There are four series of "Home with Kids", i.e. "Home with Kids 1", "Home with Kids 2", "Home with Kids 3" and "Home with Kids 4", which were released respectively in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. It is considered to be an equivalent to "Growing Pains", a US sitcom. Unlike most Chinese multi-camera sitcoms, "Home With Kids" prominently uses child actors as main roles. The series also reunites Song Dandan and Wen Xingyu, who both starred in China's first multi-camera sitcom, "I Love My Family".
The series has ended with 365 half-hour episodes.
Premise.
Xia Donghai, a director of children's drama who has divorced, returns from the U.S. with his young son Xia Yu (commonly known as "Little Yu") and daughter Xiao Xue (also known as "Little Xue") to start a family with a divorced woman Liu Mei, who has a son, Liu Xing, from her previous marriage. The five live happily in a flat in modern Beijing. The story is evolved around the family member's encounters to various issues in life and their attempts to cope/solve them, and most episodes involve the parents' attempts to act as a good example for their children and teach them know right from wrong. This family arrangement is atypical for modern Chinese families because of the one child per family policy.
Characters.
The Xia Family.
Xia Donghai (夏东海), portrayed by Gao Yalin, is the bespectacled father of Xia Xue and Xia Yu and stepfather of Liu Xing. As a director of children's drama, he is portrayed with a child-friendly personality of being kind, generous, humorous, and easygoing. As someone who has witnessed American education, his ways with the children involves mainly tolerance. understanding and signs of equality. He can also be quite lazy and incompetent at housework or sports. In the second season, he is fired from the spot of director and is recruited as the editor of a children's magazine.
Liu Mei (刘梅), portrayed by Song Dandan, is the mother of Liu Xing and stepmother of Xia Yu and Xia Xue. She is a director of nurses at a hospital and is in charge of the household. Being an adopter of more "traditional" ways of education, she often demonstrates a strong preference to Xia Xue, due to her outstanding school marks and many talents; also she often attempts to inflict corporal punishment on her misbehaving children (in particular her own son Liu Xing), but for most time she fails to do so. She is portrayed with a somewhat strong curiosity and slight overzealousness. Moreover, she constantly attempts to understand the three children and help them in all fashions possible.
Xia Xue (夏雪), portrayed by Yang Zi (in the first two seasons) and Ning Danlin (in the latter two seasons), is the elder daughter of Xia Donghai. She is a typical "smart girl" with an excellent school mark. She is confident, but also somewhat slightly arrogant, and is often the creator of the more "advanced" issues for her parents. In the first season, she distrusts her new stepmother and even tried to "scare her" by "developing" a trend for "puppy love" (which is strongly intolerated by the more "traditional" Chinese parents), but soon finds her very trustworthy. In the third season, she is depressed for not making the marks for Qinghua University, but soon overcomes the depression.
Liu Xing (刘星), portrayed by Zhang Yishan, is the son of Liu Mei. He is a rather poor student (especially at chemistry), but is quite witty and tactful. The resident troublemaker of the home, he receives most of the blames for his parents. Apart from that, he is sporty (both athletic and acrobatic), chivalrous, and always filled with ideas and advices for others (both good and bad).
Xia Yu (夏雨), portrayed by You Haoran, is the younger son of Xia Donghai. Being raised in America, he is capable of speaking good English (but prefers not to when he moved to Beijing) and has knowledge to many American customs. However, this knowledge is often countered in the episodes by his cluelessness over the usage of some Chinese language features (in particular set phrases and idioms) and Chinese traditions. He follows his stepbrother Liu Xing in his exploits, and will often be the potential troublemaker after Liu Xing. As a running gag, he often proudly announces as "the handsome little oversea-Chinese" when meeting strangers.
Secondary characters.
Grandpa or Yeye is Xia Donghai's father. He is interested in things that are for the common good, like saving electricity and saving water. He is a retired sports coach and is often very strict. Grandma calls him a Fascist.
Grandma or Laolao is Liu Mei's mother. She likes to spoil her grandchildren and spare them from any hardships and inconveniences. She dislikes Grandpa
Hu Yitong (胡一统)is the Liu Xing's hapless biological father. He often drops by unannounced, to the consternation of his ex-wife Liu Mei.
Mary or Ma Li (玛丽） is the biological mother of Xia Xue and Xia Yu. She likes to spoil them and blames Xia Donghai and Liu Mei whenever the children are upset. It is implied that she is wealthy, as she owns a BMW and carries around expensive purses.
Feifei (菲菲) is Xia Donghai's cousin.
Shubiao (鼠标) is Liu Xing's good friend. His parents are especially strict. His real name is Lin-ning (林宁）
Duoduo (朵朵) is Xia Yu's close friend.
Jianpan (键盘）is Liu Xing's other good friend.

<doc id="18624433" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18624433" title="Richard of Poitiers">
Richard of Poitiers

Richard of Poitiers (died c. 1174), also known as Richard of Cluny, was a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Cluny, and author of a small number of historical works (including a universal chronicle), treatises and poems.
Life.
Little is known about the life of Richard of Poitiers beyond the barest biographical details suggested in the title and dedication prefacing his "Chronica". His name, "Richardus Pictauiensis" indicates that he was a native of the region of Poitou, France. He calls himself a "monachus cluniacensis", an ambiguous term suggesting either that he was a monk of the Abbey of Cluny or that he was a member of the Europe-wide network of Cluniac monasteries (the "Ecclesia Cluniacensis"). Scholars have identified no further conclusive evidence for his life or background. On the basis of unique local material in a single manuscript of Richard's "Chronica", Élie Berger concluded that he resided in a Cluniac priory on the island of Aix in Poitou. The subsequent work of I. Schnack suggested, in contrast, that Richard wrote in the scriptorium of the Abbey of Cluny. The lack of any conclusive evidence makes it difficult to resolve this disagreement. From Richard's dedication of his chronicle to Peter the Venerable, it is evident that Richard was at work by 1156, the year of Peter's death. The poems attributed to Richard's authorship include an ode to London, and a condemnation of sea sickness, both of which suggest that Richard travelled beyond the confines of medieval France.
Richard of Poitiers should not be confused with Richard of Ilchester, an English contemporary who was also known as Richard of Poitiers while Archdeacon of the Cathedral of Poitiers. He should also be distinguished from King Richard I of England, whom some chroniclers of the Crusades refer to as Richard of Poitiers.
Writings.
Chronicle.
Richard's major work bears the title "Chronica Richardi Pictauiensis, monachus cluniacensis de diuersis libris collecta" ("The Chronicle of Richard of Poitiers, monk of Cluny, compiled from numerous sources"), which draws attention to the work's nature as largely compilation. 
In his dedication, Richard offers a list of sources consulted in writing his chronicle:
Despite this apparent openness, Richard cites historians, such as Suetonius and Aimonius, whom he likely only knew second hand. He also does not fully reference all his sources. In addition to the sources cited explicitly, Richard's chronicle tacitly includes material from contemporary historians, such as Fulcher of Chartres' crusading history as well as fantastical literature, such as the Pseudo-Alexander's "Letter from Alexander to Aristotle" and Geoffrey of Monmouth's "History of the Kings of England".
The diversity of material in Richard's "Chronicle" gives it an exotic feel for the modern reader, and the resulting work is quite unlike what a modern historian seeks to do. Richard, for example, does not attempt to come to a coherent portrait of history or distinguish true from false accounts. Instead, he juxtaposes multiple accounts in order to provide the most complete picture, even if his sources are contradictory. The reigns of kings or emperors, for example, might be recorded as having three or four different spans, depending on whether the reader wishes to follow Jerome, Josephus, Justinus or Orosius. The chronicle also contains significant prophetic material (from Biblical sources, or from Geoffrey of Monmouth's "Prophecies of Merlin") and Richard repeatedly seeks to identify for the reader when these prophecies are shown to be fulfilled. This concern with prophecy is an important undertone of Richard's work and relates to a traditional Cluniac interest with deciphering the divine plan identifiable from the course of human history (see Rodulfus Glaber).
As Richard himself states (see sidebar), the "Chronicle" sought to describe all of human history (as then understood) from Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden until his own time (in the 1160s and 1170s). In doing so, Richard compiled what modern historians have called a "universal history". Universal chronicles are similar to modern day textbooks of Western Civilization in the breadth of material covered. Richard's text as strongly focusses on Christian and French subject, but it also provides a wide range of material on Classical and Ancient Middle Eastern history. Such information was necessary for a Christian reader to understand Biblical history or the Classical texts still circulating during the Middle Ages.
Other historical works.
Richard compiled a "Catalogue of Popes" whose brief entries provided basic information about the time and duration of their papacy, their "nation" of origin and distinguishing events (such as miracles performed, synods held). Subsequent writers extended this text into the thirteenth century and their extensions were incorporated into later chronicles. I. Schnack has argued that this text, when taken together with Richard's treatises on the diocesean and cardinal clergy of the city of Rome, is an important source for understanding attitudes towards the developing college of cardinals.
E. Berger assigns an additional work, "A Lament upon the Destruction of Castle Julius" to Richard's authorship. It is a brief description of the siege and capture of a French castle, which Berger identifies as Châtel-Aillon, and other local history relating to the region around Aunis, France.
Treatises.
Richard's two brief descriptions of the Roman clergy are entitled, "On the seven bishops who are the vicars of the pope" and "On the seven bishop, deacons ... who assist the pope celebrate mass". These two works briefly describe those holding religious office who are fit in dignity to serve alongside the pope in power, and in sanctity.
Poems.
Although the sixteenth-century bibliophile John Bale attributes seven poems in total to Richard, the most recent editor of his poems (or "rhythmi") is unsure which can conclusively be assigned to his authorship.
Historiographical contribution.
Relation to contemporaries.
Richard of Poitiers was among the first of a new crop of twelfth-century French chroniclers to compose a universal history. Within French-speaking regions, the genre of the universal chronicle had languished after the Carolingian works of Frechulfus of Liseaux and Ado of Vienne. Interest in composing this kind of work was rejeuvenated by Hugh of St. Victor's historiographical treatise, "De tribus maximis circumstantiis gestorum", a text Richard which alludes to in his prologue. Richard also seems to take inspiration from Hugh's idea of history as a tool useful for the spiritual training of the mind and as preliminary for other study (see Hugh of Saint Victor's "Didascalicon"). Richard, like Hugh, calls history childish ("puerile") since it is first studied by school-age children.
Influence on later history writing.
The writings of Richard of Poitiers received a relatively wide circulation. In the number of extant manuscripts, his chronicle ranks alongside Otto of Freising's "Deeds of Frederick Barbarossa", and Robert of Gloucester's "Metrical Chronicle". The distribution of manuscripts in France, Spain, England, Italy and Germany, and its inclusion in monastic, episcopal and aristocratic libraries suggest a broad audience. Subsequent chroniclers, such as Amaury Augier, Martin of Troppau and William Rede, continued Richard's text into their own times, and Richard is noted as an accomplished historian by such humanists as Johann von Heidenberg, Conrad Gesner and Gerard Vossius. In the seventeenth century, his chronicle was conflated with the "Liber Exerptionum" written by Richard of Saint Victor, a misunderstanding that was often repeated until the eighteenth century, when the publication of extracts of Richard's chronicle first by Edmond Martène, and later by Luigi Muratori made this error evident. These early editors judged Richard's Chronicle to be overly derivative and edited only the concluding portions of his chronicle. 
A complete edition of the work has never been completed, but is currently under development by Marc Saurette (Carleton University) and Matthew Ponesse (Ohio Dominican University).

Taxicabs of Morocco

Two main types of taxis can be found in Morocco: 
Inner city transport.
Most Moroccan cities have dedicated taxis for transport inside the city limits. Although some of the largest cities operate city buslines most people prefer to use a "petit taxi" for point-to-point transport within city limits.
Regional transport.
For journeys to regional destinations beyond the city limits you can choose between buses (public buses for nearby destinations and private "luxury" buses for long distance and even cross-country) or the so-called "grand taxi".
Petits Taxis.
A "petit taxi" is a smaller model car painted in the designated color, which differs from city to city. It has a maximum capacity of three passengers plus the driver. There are special stops for "petits taxis", often combined with a "grand taxi" stop, where these taxis are allowed to park and wait for customers. However in most cases customers will signal or shout for a taxi when an empty one passes.
Normally a customer hires the complete taxi for his trip and pays a fare for that trip: it doesn't matter if one is alone or with a party of up to three. When there is still a vacant seat the driver might pick up another passenger if he spots a potential customer for a trip in more or less the same direction.
In most cities the drivers use a few fixed tariffs for popular destinations depending on the distance and also time of day (more expensive late at night). Taxis in busy cities like Casablanca or Marrakech are generally more expensive than in a city like Nador.
To prevent abuse by drivers of (mainly) foreign tourists some cities require a petit taxi to use a meter. In that case the fare depends on distance travelled. After 9 p.m. fares are generally 50% higher. Tourist-information brochures advise tourists to insist on using the meter or agree on a fixed price in advance.
Petits taxis are small cars such as a Fiat Uno, Peugeot 206 and similar sized models using diesel as fuel. In general the cars used are quite old (mostly from the 1990s); often the interior is overhauled and/or is a state of disrepair - at least in comparison with European standards. However some newer models, mainly Dacia Logans (which are being produced in Morocco) can be seen regularly. To allow passengers to carry luggage most cars are equipped with a simple open wooden box on the roof where oversized goods are placed without anything to secure it. As the speed inside the city limits is never high this method doesn't lead to many accidents.
The sides of this roof-rack is also the place where "petit taxi" is printed together with their local registration number.
Colors.
Some examples of colors used in Moroccan cities for petits taxis:
Grands Taxis.
Whereas petits taxis are only for local city traffic, grands taxis are mostly used for city-to-city or -village transport. Normally a grand taxi is a shared vehicle: at the main taxi stands many grands taxis gather. It is a type of share taxi system but without timetables or government influence. Each taxi will drive a more or less fixed route to a set destination and all passengers looking for transport to that destination or somewhere along the route used share one grand taxi. When the taxi is full (maximum 4 passengers on the rear seat and two on the front-passenger chair) he will depart. He might depart earlier if it takes too long to wait for a full car and/or when he expects to pick up more passengers along the route.
Although this shared use is cheap, it isn't always very comfortable for longer trips in hot summers: 7 people (including driver) are packed in a 1970s to '80s four door Mercedes without air conditioning. Many people prefer to charter a complete taxi and agree on a fixed price before departure.
Grands taxis are almost exclusively older Mercedes S-Class sedans using diesel fuel. In some extremely rare exceptions Opel Senators serve as a grand taxi. Grands taxis originating in the same region all have to paint their car the same color; quite often white, ochre or olive green. The colors of the grands taxis from one region usually differ from the color of the petits taxis of that same region; in Marrakech however, both are ochre. Small red plaques at the front and/or rear indicate their city of origin and a registration number.

<doc id="18624471" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18624471" title="Seamus Leydon">
Seamus Leydon

Seamus Leydon is a Gaelic footballer from County Galway. He was a vital part of Galway’s great "Three In A Row" side of the Mid 60’s. The "Dunmore Dynamo" was the scourge of all right half backs up and down the county for a decade.
The groundwork for Seamus’ outstanding career was laid from an early stage. He attended the great footballing college, St. Jarlath's College of Tuam, the home of so much football tradition. In 1960, the Dunmore man helped St. Jarlath's to an All-Ireland Colleges Championship. That year Leydon was also in the Galway Minor team which convincingly won the All-Ireland title, winning the Connacht final against Roscommon by 20 points and then overwhelming Cork in the All-Ireland final, 4-09 to 1-05.
His first Connacht Senior medal came in ’63 when Galway hammered Leitrim by 14 points in the final. They then accounted for Kerry in the All-Ireland semi final by four points. They lost to Dublin in the final but the big breakthrough came the next year when Kerry were toppled by the Connacht champions in the final, with Seamus marking Denis O’Sullivan, one of many formidable wing backs he came up against in his time. Further success was to follow for the tribesmen when Enda Colleran captained them to another victory over Kerry in the ’65 final and a six point win in the decider against Meath the following September. That victory ensured a memorable "Three In A Row" for Galway. It would be 32 years before the county would win another one. Seamus featured in the 1971 final when Offaly beat them by three points.
The Dunmore man himself quit the intercounty scene in 1972 when his job with Cantrell and Cochrane forced him to move to Cork to take up a position as regional manager for Munster. After having won six or seven Galway Championships with Dunmore, he started playing for Nemo Rangers in Cork who, at that time, didn’t enjoy the same reputation nationally as they do now as one of the best club footballing sides in Ireland. Since that time Nemo Rangers have won several All-Ireland Club Championships but Seamus’ only final came in 1975 when they were beaten by two points by a very strong UCD side.
In 1999, Seamus was voted on the Galway "Team Of The Millennium".

July 2007 Syrian arms depot explosion

The July 2007 Syrian arms depot explosion was a blast in July 2007 at a Syrian military depot. Syria said the explosion was the accidental detonation of an ammunition dump, but later reports suggested it was the result of a Syrian chemical weapons experiment.
Official version.
The explosion happened in Musalmiya, a city in northern Syria near Aleppo, on July 26, 2007. Officials said that high summer temperatures of up to 50°C set off explosive materials at a military base, causing ammunition dump to explode. Fifteen soldiers were reported killed, (as well as reports of 10 Iranians), and 50 were wounded; Syria said the blast was "not the result of sabotage." 
Skepticism.
"Jane's Defence Weekly" published an article in September 2007 explaining purported inaccuracies in the Syrian account. They wrote that the explosion happened at 4.30 am, the coolest time of the day, when temperatures would not have reached 50°C. They also reported that the site was a secret weapons complex rather than an arms dump.
Instead of high temperatures, the explosion was caused when fuel caught fire in a laboratory as Syrian and Iranian engineers attempted to load a mustard gas warhead onto a Scud-C missile. Fifteen Syrian military personnel and "dozens" of Iranian engineers died in the explosion, "Jane's" reported. The blast also sent a chemical cloud of mustard gas as well as Sarin and VX nerve gas across the facility.
Syria is believed to have an active chemical weapons program as well as several hundred Scud missiles. 
The reports coincided with speculation about the Israeli air strike on Syria earlier in September 2007, which was reported to have targeted a nuclear facility.

Controversy.
Mekka Don's decision to leave his lucrative job as a New York City attorney to pursue a career in hip-hop has been met with extreme criticism. Though the popular law blog Above the Law did not opine on the merits of his decision in its story, several of the blog's readers were harshly critical of his decision. Mekka Don later stated that he is "trying to show that you can still make money, have swagger, have fun, and be young – all while doing things positively" and that "you only live once, so GO FOR YOUR DREAMS".

Alain Bernard stormed home on the final lap to claim France's first ever gold medal in the event with a time of 47.21. Australia's world record holder Eamon Sullivan enjoyed a great start in the first 50 metres, but ended up with a silver in 47.32, just 0.11 of a second behind Bernard. U.S. swimmer Jason Lezak and Brazil's César Cielo tied for the bronze medal in a matching time of 47.67.
Two-time defending champion Pieter van den Hoogenband finished the race in fifth place at 47.75. Although he missed an opportunity to attain a third straight triumph in the same event, Van den Hoogenband became the first ever swimmer to reach the final at his fourth Olympics. Four months later, he announced his retirement from the sport, ending an Olympic career with a total of seven medals, including three golds.
Van den Hoogenband was followed in sixth by South Africa's Lyndon Ferns (48.04), and in seventh by Sullivan's teammate Matt Targett (48.20). After missing out the semifinals in Athens four years earlier, Sweden's Stefan Nystrand rounded out the finale to eighth place in 48.33.

Shepherds Flat Wind Farm

The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm is a 845 megawatt (MW) wind farm in the U.S. state of Oregon. The facility is located in Eastern Oregon in both Morrow and Gilliam counties, near Arlington. Approved in 2008 by state regulators, groundbreaking came in 2009. The wind farm was built by Caithness Energy using General Electric (GE) 2.5 MW wind turbines, and it supplies electricity to Southern California Edison. The wind farm is estimated to have an economic impact of $16 million annually for Oregon. It is one of the largest land-based wind farms in the world. It officially opened in September 2012.
Details.
The wind farm is located in Eastern Oregon in both Morrow and Gilliam counties, with the majority of the turbines to be in Gilliam County. Oregon provided tax incentives to the developer to help land the facility, but the project is expected to provide Gilliam County with about $5 million annually in taxes and fees when it is operating. Shepherds Flat is entirely on private property approximately southeast of the city of Arlington between Oregon Route 19 and Oregon Route 74. Construction on the project is expected to employ 400 people to build of power lines and of roads on the wind farm.
Plans for the project first came in 2002 for a 105 megawatt project, with the plan changed to larger project in 2004. The project was then submitted to the state in 2006 with plans to have the first phase online in 2008. Early plans called for 303 turbines and a generating capacity of 909 megawatts. At the time, it would have doubled the capacity for wind-generated power in Oregon. The farm is divided into several sections, with the Willow Creek Wind Farm between two of the larger segments.
Approved in 2008 by state regulators, groundbreaking came in 2009. The project design now includes 338 GE2.5XL turbines built by GE Wind Energy, each with a capacity to produce 2.5 megawatts, and used for the first time in USA. These turbines and a ten-year service contract cost a total of $1.4 billion, the largest expense on the estimated $2 billion project. In December 2010, the Department of Energy (DOE) offered a $1.3 billion loan guarantee for the project. The insurance fee for the loan guarantee would be paid from federal stimulus money through the Financial Institution Partnership Program. Generating capacity will be 845 megawatts, producing an estimated 2 billion kW·h each year, enough to provide electricity to 235,000 homes. Once operational, the facility will have about 35 permanent employees. The wind farm is estimated to have an economic impact of $16 million annually for Oregon.
In April 2011, Google announced they had invested $100 million in the project, part of a $500 million investment package announced by GE and including as investors, also, subsidiaries of Itochu Corp. and Sumitomo Corp..
Concerns.
There are concerns that have been raised by taxpayer watchdog groups and various blogs. They point out that large private ranch owners in the area will receive up to $12,000 annually per turbine leased on their land while they have already received tens of millions of dollars in U.S. government subsidies over the years and then benefiting from taxpayer subsidies of the wind energy industry. Some local ranchers due to benefit or already benefiting from the partially government subsidized wind energy projects were published as receiving nearly $1 million in government agricultural subsidies in 2008 alone.

The men's 200 metre freestyle event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 10–12 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. 
After winning a bronze in Athens four years earlier, Michael Phelps blasted a new world record of 1:42.96 to claim his third straight gold, ninth career, and eleventh overall medal at the Olympics. South Korea's Park Tae-Hwan added a silver to his collection, following an unprecedented triumph in the 400 m freestyle two days earlier. He established a new Asian record of 1:44.85 to clear a 1:45 barrier, and used a final-lap split of 26.17 to edge out Phelps' teammate Peter Vanderkaay, who took home a bronze medal in a personal best of 1:45.14.
South Africa's Jean Basson finished fourth with a time of 1:45.97, and was followed in the fifth spot by Germany's Paul Biedermann in 1:46.00. Switzerland's Dominik Meichtry, who raced to a top seed in the prelims, earned a sixth spot in 1:46.95, while Japan's Yoshihiro Okumura (1:47.14) and Great Britain's Robbie Renwick (1:47.47) rounded out the finale. Renwick missed out the semifinals by 0.01 of a second from the prelims, but was offered a second shot, following a sudden withdrawal of two swimmers. Canada's Brent Hayden and France's Amaury Leveaux later scratched the event to focus on their duty in the 4×100 m freestyle relay.

Competing at his third Games, Oussama Mellouli made an Olympic milestone to become Tunisia's first ever gold medalist in 48 years. He denied Australia's Grant Hackett a third straight title in the event, touching the wall first in an African record of 14:40.84. Hanging with the leaders through the first two-thirds of the race, Mellouli moved into the lead at the 1,100-metre mark, and held off Hackett's sprinted finish on the final lap. This was also a retribution for Mellouli, who served an 18-month doping ban from FINA for using the banned stimulant Adderall.
Trying to become the first male swimmer to win three gold medals in the same event, Hackett collected a silver in 14:41.53. Meanwhile, Canada's Ryan Cochrane powered home with a bronze in 14:42.69, finishing ahead of Russia's Yuri Prilukov (14:43.21). U.S. swimmer Larsen Jensen, silver medalist in Athens four years earlier, placed fifth with a time 14:48.16, and was followed in the sixth spot by Great Britain's David Davies in 14:52.11. Chinese duo Zhang Lin (14:55.20) and Sun Yang (15:05.12) rounded out the finale.
Earlier in the prelims, Cochrane established a new Olympic record of 14:40.84 in heat three, until Hackett cleared a 14:40 barrier, and lowered the record to 14:38.92 in the final heat of five.

Controversy.
Iran's Mohammad Alirezaei was due to race against Israel's Tom Be'eri in the fourth heat of the 100 metre breaststroke, but pulled out, apparently under the orders from officials of the Iranian delegation. Efraim Zinger, Olympic Committee of Israel General Secretary, criticized the withdrawal saying "Politics takes precedence over sport with the Iranians and the Olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west". Giselle Davies, director of communications for the IOC, said that Alirezaei withdrew because of sickness and submitted his case in writing to his Federation. At the 2004 Games in Athens, Iran's Arash Miresmaeili, a two-time world judo champion, refused to compete against Israel's Ehud Vaks in the opening round of the 66 kg competition, later admitting that he made his decision to show solidarity for the Palestinian cause.

Tell Arbid

Tell Arbid is an ancient Near East archaeological site in the Khabur River Basin region of Al-Hasakah Governorate, Syria near Tell Mozan, the site of ancient Urkesh.
History.
Little is currently known about the history or identity of Tell Arbid. The site was heavily occupied during Early Dynastic times of the 3rd Millennium, primarily Ninevite 5 and Early Dynastic III periods, then sporadically in the Akkadian, Mitanni, Neo-Babylonian and the Hellenistic period.
Archaeology.
The site comprises a large main tell and 4 smaller mounds, together covering about 38 hectares with a height of around 30 meters. The main tell consists primarily of Mittani, Akkadian, Early Dynastic, and Ninevite 5 layers with the later two including monumental buildings. The initial excavation of Tell Arbid was performed by a British Museum team led by M.E.L. Mallowan. The operation ran from 1934 to 1936. Items collected during the excavations ended up in the British Museum, the Institute of Archaeology Collections at University College London, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and in Syria. A survey was done at the site in the 1990s by Bertille Lyonnet of the Centre National de Recherches Scientifiques in Paris. Since 1996, the site has been excavated by a Polish and Syrian team led by Piotr Bieliński from University of Warsaw's Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology and Dr. Ahmad Serriyeh from Damascus University.This work has continued through the 2010 season.
During 2000 they were assisted by a joint American/Austrian team from the University of Vienna and Archeos Inc.

Japan's Kosuke Kitajima blasted a new Olympic record of 2:07.64 to strike another breaststroke double, and to defend his title in the event. He registered a straightforward triumph over Brenton Rickard, who earned a silver medal in an Australian record of 2:08.88. France's Hugues Duboscq added a second bronze and third overall to his collection in 2:08.94, finishing just ahead of Canada's Mike Brown by almost a tenth of a second (0.10) with a time of 2:09.03.
Hungary's Dániel Gyurta, silver medalist in Athens four years earlier, finished outside the medals in fifth place at 2:09.22. Earlier in the prelims, he established an Olympic record by winning the final of seven heats in 2:08.68. 
U.S. swimmer Scott Spann turned in another sub-2:10 barrier to earn a sixth spot in 2:09.76. Italian tandem Loris Facci (2:10.57) and Paolo Bossini (2:11.48) closed out the field. Bossini set a new Olympic record of 2:08.98 to shave 0.46 seconds off Kitajima's mark in Athens, until Gyurta took three-tenths of a second (0.30) off the record time a few minutes later.
Notable swimmers failed to reach the top 8 final, featuring American Eric Shanteau, who entered the Games while battling testicular cancer, and Kazakhstan's Vladislav Polyakov, who finished fifth in Athens four years earlier.

Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre butterfly

The men's 100 metre butterfly event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 14–16 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. 
U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps blasted a new Olympic record of 50.58 to defend his title in the event, edging out Serbia's Milorad Čavić (50.59) by one hundredth of a second (0.01). He also earned his seventh Olympic gold at a single Games, tying Mark Spitz's 1972 record for the most gold medals. Australia's Andrew Lauterstein earned a bronze in 51.12, finishing in a close race against world record holder Ian Crocker by a slimmest margin. Phelps' triumph occurred after Čavić had made remarks that it would be better for the sport if Phelps was defeated. Phelps' margin of triumph was so close that the Serbian team filed a protest, but, after officials reviewed the video, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced that Phelps did touch the wall first and his victory would be upheld. 
Kenya's Jason Dunford finished fifth with a time of 51.47, and was followed in the sixth spot by Japan's Takuro Fujii, in an Asian record of 51.50. Ukraine's Andriy Serdinov (51.59), the bronze medalist in Athens four years earlier, and Papua New Guinea's Ryan Pini, gold medalist at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, (51.86) closed out the field. Dunford and Pini also made history as the first swimmer for their respective nation to reach an Olympic final.
Out of six individual events from his Olympic program, Phelps did not break the current world record in a final, finishing just 0.18 of a second behind Crocker's time of 50.40, set in 2005. In the entire event, other records were established, the Olympic record, five continental records, and several national records.
Preview.
Due to a combination of the venue, Beijing National Aquatics Center (better known as the Water Cube), which was claimed to be built to increase the speed of the swimmers, and the recently introduced LZR Racer swim suits, which had been proven to give the swimmer a lower time by 1.9 to 2.2%, some analysts were predicting that many fast times and world records would be set in all the swimming events.
As with almost every event that he entered in at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Michael Phelps was the favorite to win the men's 100 metre butterfly. Since winning the gold medal at the previous Games, in Athens, Phelps had demonstrated his superiority in this event, by also becoming world champion at the Melbourne 2007 World Championships, and achieving victory at the United States Olympic Trials. Therefore, the 100 metre butterfly was one of the eight Olympic events where Phelps was attempting to win a gold medal.
Going into the event, Phelps' compatriot Ian Crocker was seen as the swimmer with the best chance of beating Phelps. Crocker beat Phelps' 100 metre butterfly world record in 2003, and had since lowered it twice: once at the 2004 United States Olympic trials, and then at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal. Before the Olympics, Crocker and Phelps held the seventeen fastest times ever in the event. In 2004, Crocker was the favorite in the men's 100 metre butterfly, but lost to Phelps by four one-hundredths of a second. This victory gave Phelps the right to swim in the final of the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, however he gave up the spot to Crocker, and took his turn in the semifinals. Although holding the world record, Crocker had lost the last four times that he was up against Phelps in the 100 metre butterfly, including the 2008 United States Olympic Trials. Some thought that Crocker was not in the same shape that he was when we broke the world record, including Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) analyst Byron MacDonald who said that "If he's (Crocker) going to beat Phelps in Beijing, Crocker has to get close to his world record time of 50.40. He just hasn't shown it can do it this year".
Another threat to Phelps' goal was Serbia's Milorad Čavić. In Athens 2004, Čavić was leading in a semifinal of the 100 metre butterfly, but right after his final turn, his suit opened at the neck and sucked in water, causing Čavić to finish last with a time of 53.12 seconds. At the 2008 European Championships, Čavić won the men's 50 metre butterfly and was the heavy favorite to win at twice that distance, but was suspended for wearing a "Kosovo is Serbia" t-shirt on the medal podium. American swimmer Gary Hall, Jr. told "The New York Times" that although "Mike (Phelps) has been saying he’s going to win the 100 fly at the Olympics for the last year", he thought that Čavić would be the winner.
Other possible medal contenders included Andriy Serdinov of Ukraine, who had won the Olympic bronze medal in 2004, and Venezuelan Albert Subriats, a bronze medalist at the 2007 World Championships and seen as a potential spoiler, if he could match or improve on his 51.82 time, in Beijing.
Competition.
Heats.
The heats began on August 14, at 19:57 local time (CST or UTC+8). There were nine preliminary heats, but all sixteen qualifiers came from the last five heats. Only three swimmers participated in the first heat, which was won by Andrejs Duda of Latvia with a time of 55.20 seconds. 
Heats 2, 3, and 4 were won by Shaune Fraser (Cayman Islands), Rimvydas Šalčius (Lithuania), and Jakob Schioett Andkjaer (Denmark), respectively. Salcius, Jeremy Knowles (Bahamas), and Alon Mandel (Israel) all broke their countries' previous records, while in heat 4, Andkjaer, Michal Rubáček of the Czech Republic, Sotirios Pastras of Greece, and Ioan Stefan Gherghel of Romania also set new national records. 
South African Lyndon Ferns was the first swimmer to qualify for the semifinals, winning heat 5 with a time of 52.04 seconds, while national records were broken by Mario Todorović (Croatia), Simão Morgado (Portugal), and Douglas Lennox-Silva (Puerto Rico). 
Sergii Breus (Ukraine) and Shi Feng (China), finished first and second in heat 6, with times of 51.82 and 51.87 seconds, respectively, that allowed them to reach the semifinals. 
Five of the eight swimmers in heat 7 advanced as well, including Jason Dunford (Kenya), Andrew Lauterstein (Australia), Takuro Fujii (Japan), Frédérick Bousquet (France), and Ryan Pini (Papua New Guinea). Dunford, with a 51.14 time, set a new Olympic record, beating Phelps' previous record of 51.25 seconds, achieved in the final of the 100 metre butterfly in Athens; he also set new African and Kenyan records. Andrew Lauterstein's 51.37 time was a new Oceanic and Australian best. Takuro Fujii set a Japanese and an Asian record with his 51.50 time.
The swimmers qualifying from heat 8 were Albert Subirats Altes (Venezuela), Corney Swanepoel (New Zealand), and Ian Crocker (United States). Records broken in the this heat included the South American and Venezuelan records (by Altes), and the New Zealand record (by Swanepoel). 
Heat 9 was the fastest one, with Milorad Čavić (Serbia), Michael Phelps (United States), Andrii Serdinov (Ukraine), Peter Mankoč (Slovenia), and Kaio de Almeida (Brazil) all earning spots in the next round. Čavić, the heat's winner with a 50.76 time, beat the Olympic record set by Dunford two heats earlier, thus also setting a new European and Serbian record. Serdinov and Mankoč also managed to break their national records.
Semifinals.
The semifinals were held on August 15 and started at 11:26 CST. The first semifinal was won by Michael Phelps with a time of 50.97 seconds. Other three swimmers qualified from this semifinal: Andrew Lauterstein (51.27 seconds), Jason Dunford (51.33 seconds), and Ryan Pini (51.62 seconds). Surprisingly, Albert Subirats Altes, the bronze medalist at the 2007 World Championships, failed to qualify, after finishing in the sixth place. Also missing the cut was the host nation's representative Shi Feng, Segii Breus, and Kaio de Almeida. 
The second semifinal was won in 50.92 seconds by Milorad Čavić, once again. The remaining three qualifiers were Ian Crocker (51.27 seconds), Andriy Serdinov (51.41 seconds), and Takuro Fujii (51.59 seconds). New time bests set in the semifinals included the Oceanic and Australian records (set by Lauterstein), and the Chinese record (set by Shi).
Final.
The final took place on August 16, at 10:10 CST. Before the race, Milorad Čavić made headlines by saying in an interview that it would be better for swimming if he beat Phelps. Phelps' coach Bob Bowman used the quote to provide motivation to his protégé. In an interview, Phelps said that doubters like Čavić "fires me up more than anything, I always welcome comments. It definitely motivates me even more." Almost immediately after the race started, Čavić took the lead with Phelps getting off to a slow start. At the turn, Čavić was first, followed by Ian Crocker, while Phelps made the split in seventh place, just 0.62 seconds behind Čavić. As the two approached the finish, Čavić tried to coast to the wall on one last stroke, while Phelps, who had misjudged the end, took an extra half-stroke, causing both competitors to touch the wall at almost exactly the same time. It turned out that Phelps had actually finished one one-hundredth of a second ahead of Čavić, with a time of 50.58 seconds. Phelps even admitted that, at first, he thought the extra stroke he took had cost him the gold medal, until he looked at the scoreboard displaying the results. Andrew Lauterstein won the bronze medal, also beating Crocker by one one-hundredth of a second.
Several records were broken at the final. For the first time at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps did not break the current world record in a final, finishing eighteen one-hundredths of a second behind team-mate Crocker's 50.40-second world record from 2005; he did though set a new Olympic record. Three continental records were broken in the final, with Fujii setting a new Asian record, Čavić a new European record, and Lauterstein a new Oceanic record. Although he finished last, swimmer Ryan Pini made history as the first swimmer from Papua New Guinea to swim in an Olympic final, and even received a call from the prime minister Michael Somare congratulating him. Most notably though, Phelps won his seventh gold medal at these Games, tying Mark Spitz's record for most gold medals won at a single Olympic Games. For being able to emulate Spitz's record, Speedo, a sponsor of Michael Phelps, awarded him a US$1 million bonus, which had already been offered to him at the 2004 Summer Olympics, under the same conditions. After the final, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) arranged a joint interview with Phelps and Spitz, where Spitz praised Phelps' effort, telling him that "what you did tonight was epic" and even though at one point, Phelps was more than half a second behind Čavić, Spitz "never thought for one moment you (Phelps) were out of that race."
Protest.
Almost immediately after the end of the race, the Serbian team filed a protest claiming that Čavić touched the wall first but did not use enough force to trigger the timing sensor. Officials of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) watched the video in slow motion, and announced that Phelps' victory would be upheld. Ben Ekumbo, a FINA referee announced that "It's very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps." Although Serbia conceded their protest, not everyone was convinced that Phelps had won the gold medal; Branislav Jevtic, Serbia's deputy chef de mission for all sports, was quoted as saying "In my opinion, it's not right, but we must follow the rules. Everybody saw what happened." In one interview after the race Čavić said that he is "completely happy with where I am", while in another he revealed that he expects that "People will be bringing this up for years and saying you (Čavić) won that race. If we got to do this again, I would win it". While the result is still controversial, a high speed photograph shows Phelps touching the wall, while Cavic is still a short distance away.

<doc id="18624823" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18624823" title="Types of nationalism">
Types of nationalism

Many scholars argue that there is more than one type of nationalism. Nationalism may manifest itself as part of official state ideology or as a popular (non-state) movement and may be expressed along civic, ethnic, cultural, religious or ideological lines. These self-definitions of the nation are used to classify types of nationalism. However, such categories are not mutually exclusive and many nationalist movements combine some or all of these elements to varying degrees. Nationalist movements can also be classified by other criteria, such as scale and location.
Some political theorists make the case that any distinction between forms of nationalism is false. In all forms of nationalism, the populations believe that they share some kind of common culture. A main reason why such typology can be considered false is that it attempts to bend the fairly simple concept of nationalism to explain its many manifestations or interpretations. Arguably, all "types" of nationalism merely refer to different ways academics throughout the years have tried to define nationalism. This school of thought accepts that nationalism is simply the desire of a nation to self-determine.
Ethnic nationalism.
Ethnic nationalism, or ethnonationalism,or ethnicism defines the nation in terms of ethnicity, which always includes some element of descent from previous generations - i.e. genophilia. It also includes ideas of a culture shared between members of the group and with their ancestors, and usually a shared language. Membership in the nation is hereditary. The state derives political legitimacy from its status as homeland of the ethnic group, and from its duty to protect the national group and facilitate its family and social life, as a group. Ideas of ethnicity are very old, but modern ethnic nationalism was heavily influenced by Johann Gottfried von Herder, who promoted the concept of the "Volk", and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Ethnic nationalism is now the dominant form, and is often simply referred to as "nationalism".Theorist Anthony D. Smith uses the term 'ethnic nationalism' for non-Western concepts of nationalism, as opposed to Western views of a nation defined by its geographical territory. The term "ethnonationalism" is generally used only in reference to nationalists who espouse an explicit ideology along these lines; "ethnic nationalism" is the more generic term, and used for nationalists who hold these beliefs in an informal, instinctive, or unsystematic way. The pejorative form of both is "ethnocentric nationalism" or "tribal nationalism," though "tribal nationalism" can have a non-pejorative meaning when discussing African, Native American, or other nationalisms that openly assert a tribal identity
Civic nationalism.
Civic nationalism (or civil nationalism) is the form of nationalism in which the state derives political legitimacy from the active participation of its citizenry, from the degree to which it represents the "will of the people". It is often seen as originating with Jean-Jacques Rousseau and especially the social contract theories which take their name from his 1762 book "The Social Contract". Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of rationalism and liberalism, but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with ethnic nationalism. Membership of the civic nation is considered voluntary. Civic-national ideals influenced the development of representative democracy in countries such as the United States and France.
State nationalism is a variant of civic nationalism, very often combined with ethnic nationalism. It implies that the nation is a community of those who contribute to the maintenance and strength of the state, and that the individual exists to contribute to this goal. Italian fascism is the best example, epitomized in this slogan of Benito Mussolini: "Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato." ("Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State"). It is no surprise that this conflicts with liberal ideals of individual liberty, and with liberal-democratic principles. The revolutionary Jacobin creation of a unitary and centralist French state is often seen as the original version of state nationalism. Franquist Spain, and contemporary Kemalist Turkish nationalism are later examples of state nationalism.
However, the term "state nationalism" is often used in conflicts between nationalisms, and especially where a secessionist movement confronts an established "nation state." The secessionists speak of state nationalism to discredit the legitimacy of the larger state, since state nationalism is perceived as less authentic and less democratic. Flemish separatists speak of Belgian nationalism as a state nationalism. Basque separatists and Corsican separatists refer to Spain and France, respectively, in this way. There are no undisputed external criteria to assess which side is right, and the result is usually that the population is divided by conflicting appeals to its loyalty and patriotism.
Critiques of supposed "civic nationalism" often call for the eliminaton of the term, as it often represents either imperialism (in the case of France), patriotism, or simply an extension of "ethnic," or "real" nationalism.
Expansionist nationalism.
"Expansionist nationalism" is a radical form of imperialism that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in expansionism. It is most closely associated with the likes of Nazism (National-socialism) and American Manifest Destiny and also shares some commonalities with neoconservatism.
Romantic nationalism.
Romantic nationalism (also "organic nationalism", "identity nationalism") is the form of ethnic nationalism in which the state derives political legitimacy as a natural ("organic") consequence and expression of the nation, or race. It reflected the ideals of Romanticism and was opposed to Enlightenment rationalism. Romantic nationalism emphasized a historical ethnic culture which meets the Romantic Ideal; folklore developed as a Romantic nationalist concept. The Brothers Grimm were inspired by Herder's writings to create an idealized collection of tales which they labeled as ethnically German. Historian Jules Michelet exemplifies French romantic-nationalist history.
Cultural nationalism.
Cultural nationalism defines the nation by shared culture. Membership (the state of being members) in the nation is neither entirely voluntary (you cannot instantly acquire a culture), nor hereditary (children of members may be considered foreigners if they grew up in another culture). Yet, a traditional culture can be more easily incorporated into an individual's life, especially if the individual is allowed to acquire its skills at an early stage of his/her own life.
Cultural nationalism has been described as a variety of nationalism that is neither purely civic nor ethnic. The nationalisms of Catalonia, Quebec and Flanders have been escribed as cultural.
Post colonial nationalism.
Since the process of decolonisation that occurred after World War II, there has been a rise of Third World nationalisms. Third world nationalisms occur in those nations that have been colonized and exploited. The nationalisms of these nations were forged in a furnace that required resistance to colonial domination in order to survive. As such, resistance is part and parcel of such nationalisms and their very existence is a form of resistance to imperialist intrusions. Third World nationalism attempts to ensure that the identities of Third World peoples are authored primarily by themselves, not colonial powers.
Examples of third world nationalist ideologies are African nationalism and Arab nationalism. Other important nationalist movements in the developing world have included Indian nationalism, Chinese nationalism and the ideas of the Mexican Revolution and Haitian Revolution. Third world nationalist ideas have been particularly influential among the raft of left-leaning governments elected in Latin America in recent years, particularly on President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez's ideology of Bolivarianism which has been partly inspired by the anti-colonial ideals of Simón Bolívar.
Liberation nationalism.
Many nationalist movements in the world are dedicated to national liberation, in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise self-determination by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors. Anti-revisionist Marxist-Leninism is closely tied with this ideology, and practical examples include Stalin's early work "Marxism and the National Question" and his Socialism in One Country edict, which declares that nationalism can be used in an internationalist context i.e. fighting for national liberation without racial or religious divisions.
Left-wing nationalism.
Left-wing nationalism (also occasionally known as "socialist nationalism") refers to any political movement that combines left-wing politics with nationalism. Notable examples include Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement that launched the Cuban Revolution ousting the American-backed Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Ireland's Sinn Féin, Labor Zionism in Israel and the African National Congress in South Africa.
Liberal nationalism.
Liberal nationalism is a kind of nationalism defended recently by political philosophers who believe that there can be a non-xenophobic form of nationalism compatible with liberal values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights. Ernest Renan, author of "Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?" and John Stuart Mill are often thought to be early liberal nationalists. Liberal nationalists often defend the value of national identity by saying that individuals need a national identity in order to lead meaningful, autonomous lives and that liberal democratic polities need national identity in order to function properly.
National conservatism.
National conservatism is a political term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism, while not being nationalist or a far-right approach. Many national conservatives are social conservatives, in favour of limiting immigration, and in Europe, they usually are eurosceptics.
National conservatism is related to social conservatism, and as such may be heavily oriented towards the traditional family and social stability.
Anarchism and nationalism.
Anarchists who see value in nationalism typically argue that a nation is first and foremost a "people"; that the state is parasite upon the nation and should not be confused with it; and that since in reality states rarely coincide with national entities, the ideal of the Nation State is actually little more than a myth. Within the European Union, for instance, they argue there are over 500 ethnic nations within the 25 member states, and even more in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Moving from this position, they argue that the achievement of meaningful self-determination for all of the worlds nations requires an anarchist political system based on local control, free federation, and mutual aid. There has been a long history of anarchist involvement with left-nationalism all over the world. Contemporary fusions of anarchism with anti-state left-Nationalism include some strains of Black anarchism and Indigenism.
In the early to mid 19th century Europe, the ideas of nationalism, socialism, and liberalism were closely intertwined. Revolutionaries and radicals like Giuseppe Mazzini aligned with all three in about equal measure. The early pioneers of anarchism participated in the spirit of their times: they had much in common with both liberals and socialists, and they shared much of the outlook of early nationalism as well. Thus Mikhail Bakunin had a long career as a pan-Slavic nationalist before adopting anarchism. He also agitated for a United States of Europe (a contemporary nationalist vision originated by Mazzini). In 1880-1881, the Boston-based Irish nationalist W. G. H. Smart wrote articles for a magazine called "The Anarchist". Similarly, Anarchists in China during the early part of the 20th century were very much involved in the left-wing of the nationalist movement while actively opposing racist elements of the Anti-Manchu wing of that movement.
Religious nationalism.
Religious nationalism is the relationship of nationalism to a particular religious belief, church, or affiliation. This relationship can be broken down into two aspects; the politicisation of religion and the converse influence of religion on politics. In the former aspect, a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation. Another political aspect of religion is the support of a national identity, similar to a shared ethnicity, language or culture. The influence of religion on politics is more ideological, where current interpretations of religious ideas inspire political activism and action; for example, laws are passed to foster stricter religious adherence.
Pan-nationalism.
Pan-nationalism is usually an ethnic and cultural nationalism, but the 'nation' is itself a cluster of related ethnic groups and cultures, such as Turkic peoples. Occasionally pan-nationalism is applied to mono-ethnic nationalism, when the national group is dispersed over a wide area and several states - as in Pan-Germanism.
Diaspora nationalism.
Diaspora nationalism (or, as Benedict Anderson terms it, "long-distance nationalism") generally refers to nationalist feeling among a diaspora such as the Irish in the United States, Jews around the world after the expulsion from Jerusalem (586 BCE), the Lebanese in the Americas and Africa, or Armenians in Europe and the United States. Anderson states that this sort of nationalism acts as a "phantom bedrock" for people who want to experience a national connection, but who do not actually want to leave their diaspora community. The essential difference between pan-nationalism and diaspora nationalism is that members of a diaspora, by definition, are no longer resident in their national or ethnic homeland. Traditionally 'Diaspora' refers to a dispersal of a people from a (real or imagined) 'homeland' due to a cataclysmic disruption, such as war, famine, etc. New networks - new 'roots' - form along the 'routes' travelled by diasporic people, who are connected by a shared desire to return 'home'. In reality, the desire to return may be eschatological (i.e. end times orientation), or may not occur in any foreseeable future, but the longing for the lost homeland and the sense of difference from circumambient cultures in which Diasporic people live becomes an identity unto itself.

Miriam Kressyn

Miriam Kressyn (March 4, 1910 – October 28, 1996), one of the "First Ladies of the Yiddish Theater", acted and sang on stage, film and radio; she wrote plays as well. 
Personal life.
Kressyn was born in Białystok, Poland, the seventh child of Mashe and Yankev Kressyn. It was a poor family; her father made his living traveling to village fairs. Not being able to support the family, he emigrated to the United States, bringing two of his daughters, but three years later he traveled home alone. Miriam became a member of the "kleyn bund" but threatened with arrest for "smuggling literature" she went to America with the whole family and settled in Boston.
"By the time she arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1925, Miriam was fluent in six languages." Her mother sold a feather-bed to pay for her education. She won a $5000 scholarship to study music abroad after winning a contest between the best high school singers in New England. When Julius and Anna Nathanson, playing in Freeman's "Goldene Kaleh" in Boston, happened to hear Kressyn, they persuaded her to join their chorus. She played small roles with Max Gebil in "Khuppah-kleyd (Wedding dress)", with Ludwig Satz in "Der gazlen (The Thief)" and with Leon Blank in "The Three Brides." She didn't consider this to be a career, as she was studying law at Northeastern University.
"Her dancing ability ... bordered on the acrobatic (she was able to do a backward bend and pick up a rose from the stage with her teeth)."
It was Hy Jacobson who drew her further into Yiddish theater; she performed with him and with Aaron Lebedeff at the Londiel Theater. In 1930-31 she played at Philadelphia's Arch Street Theater (managed by Hymie Jacobson, May Sieman and Simone Woolf). In 1933 she married Jacobson and they toured in Argentina, Berlin, England, France, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland. She played the leading role (Esther) in Joseph Green's 1937 film "Der Purimshpiler" opposite her husband, with Zigmund Turkow as a traveling Purim player. She toured with Jacobsen in America and then in 1938 they returned to Poland and toured South African in 1939.
Returning to America, they took part in Maurice Schwartz's "Yiddish Art Theater" in Sholem Aleichem's "Ven ikh bin Rotschild (If I were Rothschild)". After touring in Argentina, Brazil, and London, they returned to America. In 1943 Kressyn married the well-known Yiddish actor Seymour Rechtzeit (aka Seymour Rexite); they worked in the National Theater, the Public Theater, the Second Avenue Theater, and others, co-starring with Menashe Skulnick, Michael Mikhalesko, Fuchs, A. Grossman, Zyenda, and Irving Jacobson. She performed on the radio show "The Forward's Hour" in pieces by Isaac Bashevis Singer, Osip Dimov, Dluzhnovsky and Kadia Molodowsky). For many years she had her own show, as singer and commentator, on WEVD; she wrote the show herself. Another such show was "Treft zikh mit Miriam Kressyn". She composed Yiddish lyrics for Misirlou.
"She and her husband became known as the romantic idols of Yiddish musicals. Often she was featured in a cast with other Yiddish theater favorites, including Reizl Bozyk, Ben Bonus, Leo Fuchs, Mina Bern and Jacob Jacobs."
In the late 1940s she created a Yiddish version of Philip Vordan's "Anna Lucasta" (a Broadway hit being performed by an all-negro cast) with Ben-Zion Witler playing the romantic lead; the play was a great success. In the 1960s she became Professor of Yiddish at Queens College, New York, where she also directed Yiddish plays.
In 1984 she was interviewed in "Almonds and Raisins", a documentary about Yiddish talking films made in the United States and Europe between the release of The Jazz Singer in 1927 and the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.
Kressyn continued to teach drama at Queens College until her death in 1996 in New York City, aged 86. Miriam Kressyn was the recipient of many awards such as Show Business 1973, Golden Awards for Outstanding Acting and Lifetime Achievement, Drama Desk Award, 40 years of Yiddish Radio. Seymour Rechtzeit died in 2002, New York, U.S. at the age of 91; they had no children. The couple is buried in the Yiddish Theatrical Alliance's Block 67 at Mount Hebron Cemetery; the section is reserved for the Yiddish theater community and is maintained by the Alliance.

The men's 200 metre butterfly event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 11–13 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. 
U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps blasted a new world record of 1:52.03 to defend his title in the event, and more importantly, claim his fourth Olympic gold, tenth career, and twelfth overall medal. During the final, Phelps' goggles filled with water, which prevented him from seeing anything, while he was finishing the second lap.
Hungary's László Cseh added a second silver to his hardware from the 400 m individual medley, breaking a European record of 1:52.70. Japan's Takeshi Matsuda powered home with a bronze medal in 1:52.97. 
New Zealand's Moss Burmester shared a fourth place with host nation China's Wu Peng in 1:54.35, while Poland's Paweł Korzeniowski finished sixth with a time of 1:54.60. Brazil's Kaio de Almeida (1:54.71) and Russia's Nikolay Skvortsov (1:55.14) rounded out the finale.
Earlier in the semifinals, Phelps registered his own Olympic record of 1:53.70 to establish a strong lead for the top 8 final, matching his preliminary time in the process.

Mythunga

Mythunga is a genus of pterodactyloid pterosaur from the late Early Cretaceous of Australia. It is known from a partial skull found in marine rocks of the Albian-age Toolebuc Formation near Hughenden, Queensland. Only the snout and part of the jaws are known. The teeth in the lower jaw were relatively tall (half the depth of the supporting bone), and the teeth toward the rear of the known material were widely spaced. The snout apparently was hollow, with a supporting internal boxwork of bone. "Mythunga" was described by Ralph Molnar and R. A. Thulborn in 2008, and provisionally thought to be related to plesiomorphic, and thus possibly basal, pterodactyloids. The type species is "M. camara".

Sustainable engineering

Sustainable engineering is the process of designing or operating systems such that they use energy and resources sustainably, i.e., at a rate that does not compromise the natural environment, or the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Sustainable Engineering as an Aspect of Engineering Disciplines.
Every engineering descipline is engaged in sustainable design, employing numerous initiatives, especially life cycle analysis (LCA), pollution prevention, design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and design for recycling (DfR). These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a “cap and trade” has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a “bubble” over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a “stack-by-stack” and “pipe-by-pipe” approach, i.e. the so-called “command and control” approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&M) technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life-cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective. 
 Historically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. Green engineering recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach. Green engineering attempts to achieve four goals:
1. Waste reduction;
2. Materials management;
3. Pollution prevention; and,
4. Product enhancement.
Green engineering encompasses numerous ways to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental standpoint. Every one of these approaches depends on viewing possible impacts in space and time. Engineering and architecture have always been concerned with space. Architects consider the sense of place. Engineers view the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary. The design must consider short and long-term impacts. Those impacts beyond the near-term are the province of sustainable design. 
The effects may not manifest themselves for decades. In the mid-twentieth century, designers specified the use of what are now known to be hazardous building materials, such as asbestos flooring, pipe wrap and shingles, lead paint and pipes, and even structural and mechanical systems that may have increased the exposure to molds and radon. Those decisions have led to risks to people inhabiting these buildings. It is easy in retrospect to criticize these decisions, but many were made for noble reasons, such as fire prevention and durability of materials. However, it does illustrate that seemingly small impacts when view through the prism of time can be amplified exponentially in their effects.
Sustainable design requires a complete assessment of a design in place and time. Some impacts may not occur until centuries in the future. For example, the extent to which we decide to use nuclear power to generate electricity is a sustainable design decision. The radioactive wastes may have half-lives of hundreds of thousands of years. That is, it will take all these years for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay. Radioactive decay is the spontaneous transformation of one element into another. This occurs by irreversibly changing the number of protons in the nucleus. Thus, sustainable designs of such enterprises must consider highly uncertain futures. For example, even if we properly place warning signs about these hazardous wastes, we do not know if the English language will be understood.
All four goals of green engineering mentioned above are supported by a long-term, life cycle point of view. A life cycle analysis is a holistic approach to consider the entirety of a product, process or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and final disposal. In other words, assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product.
The first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society. Once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known, the important functions and impacts of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal are estimated. Thus, in sustainable design, engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames.

True Blood

True Blood is an American television drama series created and produced by Alan Ball. It is based on "The Southern Vampire Mysteries" series of novels by Charlaine Harris, detailing the co-existence of vampires and humans in Bon Temps, a fictional, small town in northwestern Louisiana. The series centers on the adventures of Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic waitress with an otherworldly quality.
The show is broadcast on the premium cable network HBO in the United States. It is produced by HBO in association with Ball's production company, Your Face Goes Here Entertainment. It premiered on September 7, 2008. The first five seasons of the series received generally favorable reviews and won several awards, including a Golden Globe and an Emmy.
On July 15, 2013, HBO announced that "True Blood" had been renewed for a seventh and final season that will premiere in Summer 2014.
Series overview.
The fictional universe depicted in the series is premised on the notion that vampires (and other supernatural creatures) have been living among us, unbeknownst to the majority of humans until two years before the series premiere, when the creation of synthetic blood ("Tru Blood") by Japanese scientists allowed vampires to "come out of the coffin" (a term coined as a play on "coming out of the closet") and reveal their existence to the world on the basis that they no longer need to feed on humans to survive. This so-called 'Great Revelation' has split the vampires of the world into two camps: those who wish to integrate into human society (aka "mainstream") by campaigning for citizenship and equal rights, and those who think that human-vampire co-existence is impossible because it is in conflict with the inherently violent nature of vampires. Throughout the series, other supernatural creatures are also introduced, among them shapeshifters, werewolves, fairies, witches and a maenad.
The series revolves around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic Human-Fairy hybrid known as a halfling (not to be confused with similarly named, but unrelated creatures found in other fantasy works). Sookie is a waitress at "Merlotte's Bar and Grill," owned by Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) in the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps. Sam is a shapeshifter, though this secret is kept hidden from most of the town. Other characters include Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a handsome 173-year-old vampire who has returned to Bon Temps to take up residence in his former home following the death of his last remaining relative; Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley), Sookie's tough-talking but insecure best friend; Sookie's womanizing brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten); thousand-year-old vampire and Sheriff of Area 5, Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgård); and Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis), a short order cook, drug dealer, road crew member and medium.
The show explores several contemporary issues, such as the struggle for equal rights, discrimination and violence against minorities and homosexuals, the problems of drug addiction, the power of faith and religion, the control/influence of the media, the quest for identity, and the importance of family.
Production.
Development history.
Series creator Alan Ball had previously worked with the cable channel HBO on "Six Feet Under", which ran for five seasons. In October 2005 after "Six Feet Under"'s series finished, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. "True Blood" became the first project under the deal, after Ball became acquainted with Charlaine Harris's "Southern Vampire Mystery" books. One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a Barnes & Noble bookshop and came across "Dead Until Dark", the first installment in Harris's series. He read the entries that followed and became interested in "bringing vision to television". However, Harris already had two other adaptation options for the books. She said she chose to work with him, though, because "[Ball really 'got' me. That's how he convinced me to go with him. I just felt that he understood what I was doing with the books."
The project's hour-long pilot was ordered concurrently with the finalization of the aforementioned development deal and was written, directed and produced by Ball. Cast members Paquin, Kwanten and Trammell were announced in February 2007 and Masching later on in April. The pilot was shot in the early summer of 2007 and was officially ordered to series in August, at which point Ball had already written several more episodes. Production on the series began later that fall, with Brook Kerr, who portrayed Tara Thornton in the original pilot, being replaced by Rutina Wesley. Two more episodes of the series had been filmed before the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike shut down production of the 12-episode first season until 2008. That September, after only the first two episodes of the series had aired, HBO placed an order for a second season of twelve episodes of the show, with production scheduled to commence in January 2009 for a summer premiere.
Title sequence.
"True Blood"'s Emmy-nominated title sequence is composed of portrayals of the show's Deep South setting, and runs to "Bad Things" by Jace Everett, although the original featurette was created around the Jennifer Herrema (Royal Trux) song "RadTimesXpress".
Conceptually, the sequence was constructed around the idea of "the whore in the house of prayer" by intermingling contradictory images of sex, violence and religion and displaying them from the point of view of "a supernatural, predatory creature observing human beings from the shadows ..." Ideas of redemption and forgiveness are also explored, and thus the sequence progresses from morning to night and culminates in a baptism.
The title sequence was created by the independent film company Digital Kitchen. The sequence also features images and themes of death and rebirth; the circle of life. A Venus fly-trap can be seen engulfing a frog while a rotting fox’s head is sped up to reveal maggots feeding off of the corpse. Rebirth is also recognized through an image of a woman being "washed clean" from her sins in a lake as well as a Reverend blessing and possibly performing an exorcism on a member of his congregation.
Some of the footage used in the sequence was filmed on location. Digital Kitchen then took a four-day trip to Louisiana to film and also shot at a Chicago church and on a stage and in a bar in Seattle.
In editing the opening, individual frames were also splattered with drops of blood. The sequence's transitions were constructed differently, though; they were made with a Polaroid transfer technique. The last frame of one shot and the first frame of another were taken as a single Polaroid photo, which was then divided between emulsion and backing. The emulsion was then filmed being further separated by chemicals and those shots of this separation were placed back into the final edit.
Eight different typefaces, inspired by Southern road signs, were also created manually for cast and crew credits, as well as the show's title card.
In a 2010 issue of "TV Guide", the show's opening title sequence ranked #5 on a list of TV's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.
Music.
Gary Calamar, who supervises the series' music, said that his goal for the show's soundtrack is to create something "swampy, bluesy and spooky" and to feature local Louisiana musicians. "True Blood" soundtrack albums have twice earned Grammy Award nominations.
Composer Nathan Barr writes the original score for the series which features cello, guitar, prepared piano and glass harmonica among other instruments, all of which he performs himself. The main theme song is "Bad Things" by country music artist Jace Everett, from his 2005 self-titled debut.
Elektra/Atlantic Records released a "True Blood" soundtrack on May 19, 2009, the same day as the release of the DVD and Blu-ray of the first season. Nathan Barr's original score for "True Blood" was released on CD on the Varèse Sarabande label on September 8, 2009. The second True Blood soundtrack was released on May 25, 2010, to coincide with the third season's premiere in June. The third volume was released on September 6, 2011, a few days before the season four finale.
Both Nathan Barr and Jace Everett won 2009 awards from Broadcast Music Incorporated in the BMI Cable Awards category for, respectively, "True Blood's" original score and theme song.
The show's individual episode titles are named after songs featured in the episodes, usually heard during the closing credits. The title usually indicates something about the events that will unfold throughout the given episode. For example, episode ten of season four is titled "Burning Down the House" and the end credits feature a cover version of the classic Talking Heads song performed by The Used.
Marketing.
The premiere of "True Blood" was prefaced with a viral marketing/alternate reality game (ARG) campaign, based at BloodCopy.com. This included setting up multiple websites, encoding web address into unmarked envelopes mailed to high profile blog writers and others, and even performances by a "vampire" who attempted to reach out to others of their kind, to discuss the recent creation of "TrueBlood", a fictional beverage which is featured in the show.
A MySpace account with the username "Blood" had, as of June 19, uploaded two videos; one entitled "Vampire Taste Test – True Blood vs Human", and one called "BloodCopy Exclusive INTERVIEW WITH SAMSON THE VAMPIRE".
A prequel comic was handed out to attendees of the 2008 Comic-Con. The comic centers around an old vampire named Lamar, who tells the reader about how TruBlood surfaced and was discussed between many vampires before going public. At one point, Lamar wonders if TruBlood is making the world safe for vampires or from them. Several commercials featured on HBO and Facebook aired prior to the series premiere, placing vampires in ads similar to those of beer and wine. Some beverage vending machines across the US were also fitted with cards indicating that they were "sold out" of TruBlood.
HBO produced and broadcast two documentaries to promote "True Blood", entitled "True Bloodlines". The first, "Vampire Legends", explored the earliest portrayals of vampires in legend, literature and cinema. The second, "A New Type", discusses vampire culture from Nosferatu to today's sensual, sexual creatures. To that end, the show also covered the modern vampire subculture and real-life vampire clubs. Actors and writers from "True Blood" appeared in the documentaries. The shows first aired on September 6, 2008, on HBO.
Thousands of DVDs of the first episode were handed out to attendees of Midnight Madness, a special film festival. Blockbuster Video provided free rental of the first episode of "True Blood" several days before it was broadcast on HBO. The video had a faint promotional watermark throughout the episode.
On April 16, 2009, HBO released the first teaser poster for Season 2. The image uses a perspective technique that shows observers one of two images. A minute-long promotional video advertising season two, which featured Bob Dylan's "Beyond Here Lies Nothin'", was released via "Entertainment Tonight" in early May.
On September 19, 2009, HBO.com began selling Tru:Blood, a beverage branded to resemble the fictional synthetic blood that appears in the show. The beverage is a carbonated blood orange-flavored drink, developed and manufactured by Omni Consumer Products, a company that specializes in defictionalizing brands from television and movies, and FMCG Manufacturing Company, a specialist manufacturer of licensed entertainment products.
There is also a website for The Fellowship of the Sun, antagonists from the book series, featuring videos about hot-button issues such as becoming a vampire.
FX, available in the UK, launched an extensive promotional website for the series.
On September 15, 2009, HBO filed a trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a possible future electronic game based on "True Blood".
On September 18, 2009, HBO launched a "True Blood" jewelry line in collaboration with New York-based designer Udi Behr. Inspired by the series, the jewelry has a Gothic look and features sterling silver, polished steel, and rubies.
On June 1, 2010, HBO held a special event at a number of movie theaters around the U.S., complete with red carpet, searchlights and swag bags. Contest winners were invited to watch a special live, the Season 2 finale, a preview of Season 3, and a live interview on the set of "True Blood" with the cast and Alan Ball.
HBO began selling "True Blood" figural busts featuring Bill, Sookie, and Eric in summer 2010. Busts of other characters will also be available later.
HBO and IDW Publishing announced at the 2010 WonderCon that they would be publishing a comic book based on the series. Alan Ball developed and wrote the comic. The first booklet, with a print run of 53,000, was released in July 2010 and soon sold out. The second issue went on sale August 18, 2010, with a second printing of the first issue going on sale August 25.
There were a total of 6 comics issued in the series, which were published collectively as the Graphic Novel "All Together Now" on February 15, 2011. This was the first in a series of four graphic novels released by HBO under the True Blood franchise and sold in major bookstores. The following titles include "Tainted Love", "The French Quarter" and "Ongoing".
Cast and characters.
"True Blood" employs a broad ensemble cast composed of regular, central characters and a rotating group of impermanent supporting characters. Though the series is based in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a noticeable number of the actors comprising the cast are originally from outside the United States. In an interview, Ball explained that he didn't intentionally seek out "non-American" actors, but was willing to go anywhere he needed to in order "to find the actor who makes the character breathe". Ball went on to explain that, in casting, there was more of a focus on who would portray the character in a compelling way rather than who would physically resemble the characters from the book. Noting that there's a definite difference between the characters and storylines portrayed in "True Blood" and the ones depicted in "The Southern Vampire Mysteries", he described Harris as being very understanding in terms of how her work was being reinterpreted.
Principal cast.
The major characters of the first season of "True Blood" are introduced among various intertwining plot lines that surround the Bon Temps bar "Merlotte's". The show's main protagonist, Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), is a telepath and waitress at Merlotte's. In the opening episode she saves Merlotte's first vampire customer, Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), when a local couple attempts to drain him of his blood (vampire blood is known on the show as a human narcotic: "V" or "V Juice"). Through the relationship that develops between Sookie and Bill, the viewer progressively learns more about vampire culture and the limitations of vampire physiology (e.g. susceptibility to silver and the sun).
The major plot of the first season revolves around the murder of several women connected to Sookie's older brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten). The women murdered include sexual partner Maudette Pickens (Danielle Sapia), on-and-off romantic interest and Merlotte's waitress Dawn Green (Lynn Collins), grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) or simply "Gran", and girlfriend Amy Burley (Lizzy Caplan). Though the viewer is always aware of Jason's innocence in their deaths, Detective Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) targets him as the prime suspect in the investigation he conducts with Sheriff Bud Dearborne (William Sanderson) to identify their killer. Jason's best friends and co-workers, Hoyt Fortenberry (Jim Parrack) and Rene Lenier (Michael Raymond-James) provide him with support despite the turmoil he encounters. Rene, who becomes engaged to Merlotte's waitress Arlene Fowler (Carrie Preston), is eventually exposed as the Bon Temps murderer and is killed in a final confrontation with Sookie.
A secondary plot in the first season (that later develops as the primary storyline in the second) revolves around Sookie's best friend Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley). In the first episode, Tara is hired as a bartender at Merlotte's by bar owner, shapeshifter, and admirer of Sookie, Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell), with whom Tara later has a brief relationship. Tara's cousin Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis) already works as a cook at Merlotte's (in addition to several other jobs that include road crew, prostitute, and drug dealer) with Andy's cousin and Iraq War veteran, Terry (Todd Lowe). Tara's story is characterized by her relationship with her alcoholic and abusive mother Lettie Mae (Adina Porter) and her own inner "demons". During the season, Lettie Mae achieves sobriety but Tara's life begins to spin out of control. Kicked out of her home and totaling her car in a drunk driving accident, she's taken in by "social worker" Maryann Forrester (Michelle Forbes). While staying with Maryann, Tara is introduced to "Eggs" Benedict Talley (Mehcad Brooks), to whom she becomes attracted.
The final major plotline of the first season revolves around the elements of vampire society that Sookie and Bill's relationship introduce. While trying to prove her brother's innocence in relation to Maudette and Dawn's murders, Bill takes Sookie to the vampire bar "Fangtasia" to investigate. There, Sookie is introduced to Fangtasia's owner and the vampire sheriff of "Area 5" in Louisiana: Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgård). Eric is immediately interested in Sookie and her strange abilities, but his progeny and assistant Pam (Kristin Bauer) is less impressed. Eric employs Sookie to find a thief in his bar, but the perpetrator (a vampire named Longshadow) attempts to kill Sookie when she reveals his identity. Bill stakes and kills the thief to save her, but has committed a serious crime in killing another vampire. When Bill is tried for his crime, his punishment is to transform seventeen-year-old Jessica Hamby (Deborah Ann Woll) into a vampire to replace the one he destroyed.
A secondary plotline introduced in the first season (which later becomes a main plotline in Season 2) is that although many humans are attracted to vampires (referred to as "fang bangers") and flock to establishments like Fangtasia, not all people are accepting of the idea that vampires should be given rights equal to those afforded the mortals of the "True Blood" universe. During the first season, one of the ways in which anti-vampire sentiment is expressed is through regular televised appearances by the "Fellowship of the Sun", a Dallas-based church that in Season 2 becomes headed by the Reverend Steve Newlin (Michael McMillian) after his father and family are killed in a strange "accident".
During the second season of "True Blood", the influence of Maryann Forrester and the conflict between vampires and humans is expanded. Most of the cast from the first season returns and several new main characters are introduced. The same style of interconnected story telling used in the first season is repeated, with the foremost plot focusing on Maryann Forrester being revealed as a maenad with the power to influence humans. She begins by manipulating Tara and Eggs to achieve her goal of summoning her god to earth, and eventually takes control of almost the entire population of Bon Temps.
While Maryann begins establishing her hold on Bon Temps, Sookie is recruited by Eric to investigate the disappearance of his 2000-year-old maker and the Sheriff of Area 9 in Texas: Godric (Allan Hyde). While Sookie is absent from Bon Temps, Sam hires Daphne Landry (Ashley Jones) to join Merlotte's staff. Daphne (who is revealed to also be a shapeshifter) begins a romance with Sam, but is later exposed as working for Maryann. Jason also leaves Bon Temps for Dallas to join the Fellowship of the Sun, which Reverend Newlin has steered in a new militant direction despite the protestations of his wife Sarah (Anna Camp). Godric is discovered in the custody of the Fellowship, and one of Godric's lieutenants, Isabel Beaumont (Valerie Cruz), sends her human boyfriend Hugo (Christopher Gartin) to assist Sookie in infiltrating the church. Though Eric's primary interest in Dallas is finding Godric, he also attempts to place himself between Sookie and Bill. To accomplish this, he enlists the aid of Bill's maker Lorena (Mariana Klaveno);, who thus becomes a more prominent contribution to the cast after a brief introduction in the first season. In the penultimate episode of the second season, once the conflict in Texas is concluded, the vampire queen of Louisiana Sophie-Anne Leclerq (Evan Rachel Wood) is introduced. Both Bill and Eric visit her in an attempt to find out how to defeat Maryann.. Bill uses the information provided by Sophie-Anne to devise a plan involving Sam and Sookie, and the three manage to kill Maryann in the season two finale. Subsequently, Bill takes Sookie out to an exclusive French restaurant to propose to her; but before she can give her answer, Bill is kidnapped.
Season three picks up straight after the events of season two with Sookie on the hunt to track down Bill and his kidnappers. She turns to Eric for help, who is not interested (seeing this turn of events as a chance to get Sookie for himself), but he ends up sending werewolf Alcide Herveaux (Joe Manganiello) for assistance after it is revealed that Bill was taken by V-addicted werewolves in the employ of the 3000-year-old vampire king of Mississippi, Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare). Meanwhile, back in Bon Temps, Lafayette embarks on a relationship with his mother's care nurse and brujo Jesús Velasquez (Kevin Alejandro) and learns about his own special powers as a medium, while Sam hires a new waitress at Merlotte's, Wiccan Holly Cleary (Lauren Bowles).
Deadline reported that in season 4, Jessica Tuck (Nan Flanagan) and Janina Gavankar (Luna) will become season regulars. Alex Breckenridge (Kate) and Vedette Lim (Naomi) will be recurring actresses.
Joining the cast for season five will be Christopher Meloni, who previously starred on another of HBO's own original series "Oz" as well as "" for 12 years. Details on his character have yet to be released. Also joining the cast is Scott Foley as Patrick, Terry's old war buddy, Louis Herthum as JD, Kelly Overton as Rikki, a new werewolf curious how Marcus died, Carolyn Hennesy is expected to be Rosalyn Harris, a Texas vampire with twang, and Jacob Hopkins will play child vampire Chancellor Alexander Drew.
For season six, it was announced that Robert Kazinsky would join the principal cast as Ben, a faerie and a potential love interest for Sookie. He will also help Sookie and Jason discover the truth about their parents' murders. Robert Patrick, who guest starred in season five as Jackson Herveaux, was promoted to series regular for season six. Rutger Hauer, who starred in popular films such as Blade Runner and Batman Begins, was announced as a series regular playing "Macklyn", a character with "strong ties to Sookie and Jason".
As reported by "The Hollywood Reporter", Adina Porter would be returning for the seventh season as a series regular after being credited as a Special Guest Star since season two. Also upgraded to regulars are season six guest stars Amelia Rose Blaire as Willa Burrell, Bailey Noble as Adilyn Bellefleur, Luke Grimes as James and Karolina Wydra as Violet Mazurski.
Season synopsis.
Season one: 2008.
The main mystery of the first season concerns the murders of women connected to Sookie's brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten). Maudette Pickens and Dawn Green are both strangled shortly after having been alone with Jason. Though Detective Bellefleur has little doubt that Jason is the killer, the town sheriff does not suspect him. Sookie's grandmother is murdered shortly afterward. At the end of the season it is revealed that Arlene Fowler's fiancé, Rene Lenier, is actually a man named Drew Marshall who has created a false identity, complete with Cajun accent. He has been killing women who have had associations with vampires.
The first season also focuses on Sookie's relationship with Bill and Sam's relationship with Sookie's friend Tara. Bill explains the rules of being a vampire to Sookie and, after killing a vampire to defend her, is forced to "turn" a young girl named Jessica into a vampire as punishment. In the last episode of the season, Jessica is left under Bill's care. After Maudette and Dawn's murders, Jason becomes addicted to vampire blood and has a short relationship with another addict, Amy Burley, which ends when she is murdered by Marshall. The season ends with the discovery of a body in Detective Andy Bellefleur's car in Merlotte's parking lot.
Season two: 2009.
Season two focuses on two main plots – in the first, the disappearance of the 2,000-year-old vampire Sheriff of Area 9, Godric, causes Eric to enlist Sookie and Bill's aid in finding the ancient vampire in Dallas. Their paths cross Jason's as he seeks to discover meaning in his life with the Fellowship of the Sun, a church dedicated to anti-vampire activities.
The second plot line concerns a maenad named Maryann who visits Bon Temps after Tara attracts her attention at the end of the first season. Maryann is a figure from Sam's past and knows his true identity as a shapeshifter. Her influence on the town and its residents results in mayhem that grows more destructive as the season progresses. At the end of the season, Bill proposes to Sookie, but is kidnapped by unknown assailants when Sookie retreats to the bathroom to consider his proposal.
The second season loosely follows the plot of the second novel of "The Southern Vampire Mysteries", "Living Dead in Dallas". In addition, the character of Sophie-Anne Leclerq, initially introduced in the sixth novel "Definitely Dead", was introduced as a major supporting character.
Season three: 2010.
On July 30, 2009, HBO confirmed that "True Blood" would be renewed for a third season, which began shooting on December 3, 2009. It premiered on June 13, 2010, simultaneously on HBO and HBO Canada, and contained 12 episodes.
Season three loosely follows the plot of the third novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, "Club Dead", and introduces werewolves to the show's mythology. It also introduces the characters of Russell Edgington, the Vampire King of Mississippi, and his private investigator, Franklin Mott. In addition, some characters from the fourth novel "Dead to the World" are introduced: Crystal Norris as Jason's love interest, her family of werepanthers from Hotshot, and Sookie's fairy godmother, Claudine. Sookie's heritage as part faerie is also revealed later in the season, a major plot element from the eighth and ninth novels "From Dead to Worse" and "Dead and Gone". This season ends with Jason left to take care of Hotshot, Tara leaving Bon Temps, Bill fighting the queen, Sam shooting Tommy, and Hoyt and Jessica, moving in together. The final cliffhanger is Claudine taking Sookie to Faerie.
Season four: 2011.
The fourth season of "True Blood" contains 12 episodes. The first, titled "She's Not There", aired Sunday, June 26, 2011 in the US on HBO; the season finale aired Sunday, September 11, 2011. It is loosely based on the fourth novel in The Southern Vampire Mysteries series, "Dead to the World".
A coven of witches, led by Marnie, poses a threat to vampires when they discover the witches are working on necromancy. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a year (even though she was away for only a few minutes in Fairie Land) to find Bill as the new King of Louisiana and that her brother and friends had given up on her. As the series progresses, a powerful necromancer from the 16th century, Antonia, possesses the body of Marnie in order to exact revenge on all vampires. Sookie starts a romance with Eric who has amnesia due to a spell cast by Antonia / Marnie. The witch Antonia eventually realizes the wrongdoing she's caused to innocent people and decides to stop. Yet Marnie, addicted to Antonia's power, binds her against her will to acquire her powers. Subplots include Lafayette's introduction to the world of magic and his abilities as a medium, Sam's family troubles, Alcide and Debbie's troubled relationship, and Jason, Hoyt and Jessica's love triangle. The finale is a series of cliffhangers, including a warning from the ghost of Rene that Terry will cause Arlene trouble, the escape of Russell Edgington, the reappearance of Steve Newlin as a vampire, and the shooting of Tara.
Season five: 2012.
On August 11, 2011, HBO announced that "True Blood" would be renewed for a fifth season of 12 episodes, to premiere in summer of 2012, with a confirmed date of June 10 at 9pm.
Alan Ball signed a multi-year contract with HBO in July 2011, but only agreed to produce the show for the fifth season. After the season five finale, he'll leave his position as showrunner.
The season follows Bill and Eric being captured by the Vampire Authority after the disappearance of Nan Flanagan. The two are almost sentenced to death by the Guardian, Roman, before revealing that Russell Edgington is alive and free after being released by a mysterious vampire. With the help of Sookie and Alcide, the team discovers his hiding place and brings him in. Season 5 also focuses on Terry, who learns he is cursed after committing a terrible crime during the war in Iraq. Meanwhile, Sookie learns that her powers are limited and contemplates having a normal life. Jason discovers his parents were murdered by a vampire and vows to find out who is responsible. Lafayette tries to deal with the powers given to him by Jesus. Russell, along with Eric's vampire sister Nora and Salome, redefine the values of the Authority and view humans as nothing more than food: just as Lilith of the Vampire bible wanted. The season ends with Bill drinking the blood of Lilith in front of Sookie and Eric. He begins to fall apart, ultimately meeting the "true death". Shortly after, a nude Bill "rises from the blood", as an even more powerful vampire reincarnation of Lilith ("Billith"). Surprised, Eric yells for Sookie to run prior to the end credits playing.
Season six: 2013.
The sixth season of True Blood premiered on June 16, 2013. After Ball's departure from the series, Brian Buckner has replaced Ball as the show's showrunner.
Season seven: 2014.
True Blood will be back in the summer of 2014 with a new season. On September 3, 2013, Michael Lombardo, president, HBO Programming, announced that the seventh season will be the last season, and it will consist of 10 episodes.
Reception.
Critical reception.
Critical reception of "True Blood" has generally been very favorable, despite the fact that initial impressions were mixed. Linda Stasi of the "New York Post" wrote of the opening episodes: "If HBO's new vampire show is any indication, there would still be countless deaths – especially among vampire hunters and the viewers who love them – because everyone would be dying of boredom. And so it is with HBO's new series from death-obsessed Alan Ball, creator of the legendary "Six Feet Under", whose new show "True Blood", won't so much make your blood run cold as it will leave you cold."
Whereas "USA Today" concluded: "Sexy, witty and unabashedly peculiar, "True Blood" is a blood-drenched Southern Gothic romantic parable set in a world where vampires are out and about and campaigning for equal rights. Part mystery, part fantasy, part comedy, and all wildly imaginative exaggeration, " Blood" proves that there's still vibrant life — or death — left in the 'star-crossed cute lovers' paradigm. You just have to know where to stake your romantic claim."
By the end of the first season, "True Blood" had a score of 64, indicating generally favorable reviews, on Metacritic, an aggregator of critical responses. The second season received a more favorable score of 74 on Metacritic. The third season's rating on Metacritic has risen to 79, while the fourth season has a rating of 74. The fifth season has a rating of 73. The sixth season has a rating of 56.
Cultural influence.
"True Blood" was the subject of a 2010 "Sesame Street" sketch entitled "True Mud". The parody features puppet versions of Sookie, Bill, Lafayette, Sam, Tara and Sheriff Dearborn. In the skit, Muppet Sookie struggles to fulfill Muppet Bill's pleas for a pint of "True Mud", as the other characters speculate if he is a "grouch".
In August 2010, Anna Paquin (Sookie), Stephen Moyer (Bill), and Alexander Skarsgård (Eric) appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone covered in blood and completely naked. This cover drew criticism due to the image's supposed promotion of sexuality and violence. The show’s creator, Alan Ball, stated in the magazine, "To me, vampires are sex... I don't get a vampire story about abstinence. I'm 53. I don't care about high school students. I find them irritating and uninformed."
Allegory of LGBT rights.
The struggle for vampire equality in "True Blood" has been interpreted as an allegory for the LGBT rights movement. Charlaine Harris, the author of the book series on which the show is based, stated that her initial characterization for the vampires were as "...a minority that was trying to get equal rights". Several phrases in the series are borrowed and adapted from expressions used against and about LGBT people, such as "God Hates Fangs" (God Hates Fags) and "Coming out of the coffin" (coming out of the closet).
"Entertainment Weekly"'s Ken Tucker wrote that the show is built "around a series of metaphors: Vampire rights stand in for gay rights, and now the clever laughs elicited from this bratty-vampire girl represent an extreme of adolescent rebelliousness". David Bianculli of NPR wrote, " "True Blood" is big on allegory, and the tension about accepting vampires into society is an obvious play on civil rights in general, and gay rights in particular". However, the series' creator, Alan Ball, who is gay, has stated that such a comparison is lazy and possibly homophobic; and Lauren Gutterman of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies has expressed concerns that the show might perpetuate negative stereotypes of homosexuals as deviants.
Ratings.
The first episode of "True Blood" debuted at a very modest 1.44 million viewers compared to the network's past drama premiers such as "Big Love" which premiered at 4.56 million, and "John from Cincinnati" which debuted at 3.4 million. However, by late November 2008, 6.8 million a week were watching: this figure included repeat and on-demand viewings. The season finale's viewership was 2.4 million.
The second season premiere of the series (June 14, 2009) was viewed by 3.7 million, making it the most watched program on HBO since the series finale of "The Sopranos". The total number of viewers for the season premiere, including the late night replay, was 5.1 million.
The tenth episode of the second season (August 23, 2009) was seen by 5.3 million viewers, a new record for the series. The second season's finale (September 13, 2009) was seen by 5.1 million viewers. An average of 12.4 million a week watched the second season.
The ninth episode of the fourth season (August 21, 2011) set a new record with 5.53 million viewers, making it the most viewed episode to date.
"True Blood" is HBO's most watched series since "The Sopranos". The show was declared the eighth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002-2012).
Awards and nominations.
The show won an Outstanding Casting for a Drama at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards; the two lead actors have both been recognized for their performances:
The show received an American Film Institute Award in 2009 as "One of the 10 Best TV Programs" and was chosen as "Favorite TV Obsession" at the 36th People's Choice Awards. Its stunt performers have been recognized for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards
DVD and Blu-ray releases.
The "True Blood" DVDs have been consistent best-sellers in the US. By the end of 2009, the first season DVD had sold over 1.6 million units and taken in over $57 million. It was the only TV show in the 50 top-selling DVDs of 2009. The second season DVD sold a total of 1,159,509 units in 2010, earning over $41 million. The third season DVD was the 61st best-selling DVD of 2011, selling almost 1 million copies and earning over $30 million. It was the best selling TV box set of 2011. In its first week of release—the week ending June 2, 2012—season four debuted at number one on the UK "TV on Video" chart. However, it reached only number six in the combined DVD chart. In its first week of release in North America, it sold over 660,000 units, earning nearly $20 million. In its second week of release in North America, it sold a further 120,000 units (making a combined total of 784,000 units sold), earning another $4 million.

1900–01 Ottawa Hockey Club season

The 1900–01 Ottawa Hockey Club season was the team's 16th season of play. The club would win the 1901 Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL) championship, but did not challenge for the Stanley Cup.
Regular season.
The club went undefeated through the season, but because the Montreal Shamrocks lost a Stanley Cup challenge to the Winnipeg Victorias, Ottawa did not win the Cup as a result of league play. At first, Ottawa was intending to challenge Winnipeg for the Cup, but on February 27, 1901 announced that they would not do so that winter. According to Coleman(1966), Ottawa did not issue a challenge due to the "lateness of the season." The "Ottawa Journal" as reported in "The Globe" suggested that the Ottawa club was wise in their decision, as they were in "racked condition in which they are, as a result of the immensely hard exertions put forth by them in all their games this season". The Ottawa Hockey Club did not challenge the following season, either.

Type 91 10 cm howitzer

The was a howitzer used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. The Type 91 number was designated for the year the gun was accepted, 2591 in the Japanese imperial year calendar, or 1931 in the Gregorian calendar.
History and development.
The Type 91 10 cm howitzer was an orthodox design howitzer, based largely on contemporary French Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider howitzers ordered during the late 1920s by the Japanese Army Technical Bureau for evaluation purposes. It was intended to supplement, and eventually supersede the largely obsolete Type 38 15 cm howitzer, which had been in service since the end of the Russo-Japanese War. Over one thousand units were produced beginning in 1931. 
Design.
For a weapon of modern design the Model 91 (1931) 105-mm howitzer is by U. S. standards an extremely crude-looking piece. It is much smaller and lighter than the German and U. S. howitzers of the same caliber, weighing even less than the standard 75-mm guns used in Europe in World War I. Despite its lightness and its appearance of not having been quite finished, it is capable of throwing a 35-pound shell very nearly as far as can the heavier and far more formidable looking German 105-mm howitzer.
The Type 91 10 cm howitzer was a standard 105-mm artillery piece of extremely light construction relative to range and weight of projector. Identification Demountable spade plates, long cradle extending almost to muzzle end of tube, a hydropneumatic recoil mechanism, split trail, and interrupted screw breech mechanism. It was designed to be towed by a team of six horses.
The Type 91 fired a 15kg standard high-explosive shell, up to 10,500 metres and could also fire chemical, armor-piercing, and shrapnel shells. Japanese charge-system numbering is

Goldfish

The goldfish ("Carassius auratus auratus") is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. It was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish.
A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a less-colorful carp ("Carassius auratus") native to east Asia. It was first domesticated in China more than a thousand years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).
History and evolution.
History.
Starting in ancient China, various species of carp (collectively known as Asian carps) have been domesticated and reared as food fish for thousands of years. Some of these normally gray or silver species have a tendency to produce red, orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in the Jin Dynasty (265–420).
During the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety, keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water. On special occasions at which guests were expected they would be moved to a much smaller container for display.
By the Song Dynasty (960–1279), the domestication of goldfish was firmly established. In 1162, the empress of the Song Dynasty ordered the construction of a pond to collect the red and gold variety. By this time, people outside the imperial family were forbidden to keep goldfish of the gold (yellow) variety, yellow being the imperial color. This is probably the reason why there are more orange goldfish than yellow goldfish, even though the latter are genetically easier to breed.
During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), goldfish also began to be raised indoors, which led to the selection for mutations that would not be able to survive in ponds. The occurrence of other colors (apart from red and gold) was first recorded in 1276. The first occurrence of fancy-tailed goldfish was recorded in the Ming Dynasty. In 1603, goldfish were introduced to Japan, where the Ryukin and Tosakin varieties were developed. In 1611, goldfish were introduced to Portugal and from there to other parts of Europe.
During the 1620s, goldfish were highly regarded in southern Europe because of their metallic scales, and symbolized good luck and fortune. It became tradition for married men to give their wives a goldfish on their one-year anniversary, as a symbol for the prosperous years to come. This tradition quickly died, as goldfish became more available, losing their status. Goldfish were first introduced to North America around 1850 and quickly became popular in the United States.
Related species.
Goldfish were bred from Prussian carp ("Carassius auratus gibelio") in China, and they remain the closest wild relative of the goldfish. Previously, some sources claimed the Crucian carp ("Carassius carassius") as the wild version of the goldfish. However, they are differentiated by several characteristics. "C. auratus" have a more pointed snout while the snout of a "C. carassius" is well rounded. "C. gibelio" often has a grey/greenish color, while crucian carps are always golden bronze. Juvenile crucian carp have a black spot on the base of the tail which disappears with age. In C. auratus this tail spot is never present. "C. auratus" have fewer than 31 scales along the lateral line while crucian carp have 33 scales or more.
When found in nature, "C. auratus gibelio" are olive green. Introduction of goldfish into the wild can cause problems for native species. Goldfish can hybridize with certain other species of carp. Within three breeding generations, the vast majority of the hybrid spawn revert to their natural olive color. The mutation that gave rise to the domestic goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Koi may also interbreed with the goldfish to produce a sterile hybrid fish.
There are many different varieties of domesticated goldfish. Fancy goldfish are unlikely to survive in the wild because of their bright colors and long fins; however the hardier varieties such as the Shubunkin or Comet may survive long enough to breed with wild cousins. Common and comet goldfish can survive, and even thrive, in any climate that can support a pond.
Biology.
Size.
As of April 2008, the largest goldfish in the world was believed by the BBC to measure , and be living in the Netherlands. At the time, a goldfish named "Goldie", kept as a pet in a tank in Folkestone, England, was measured as and over , and named as the second largest in the world behind the Netherlands fish. The secretary of the Federation of British Aquatic Societies (FBAS) stated of Goldie's size that "I would think there are probably a few bigger goldfish that people don't think of as record holders, perhaps in ornamental lakes". In July 2010, a goldfish measuring and was caught in a pond in Poole, England, thought to have been abandoned there after outgrowing a tank.
Feeding.
In the wild, the diet of goldfish consists of crustaceans, insects, and various plant matter. Like most fish, they are opportunistic feeders and do not stop eating on their own accord. Overfeeding can be deleterious to their health, typically by blocking the intestines. This happens most often with selectively bred goldfish, which have a convoluted intestinal tract. When excess food is available, they produce more waste and faeces, partly due to incomplete protein digestion. Overfeeding can sometimes be diagnosed by observing faeces trailing from the fish's cloaca.
Goldfish-specific food has less protein and more carbohydrate than conventional fish food. It is sold in two consistencies—flakes that float, and pellets that sink.
Enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas (with outer skins removed), blanched green leafy vegetables, and bloodworms. Young goldfish benefit from the addition of brine shrimp to their diet. As with all animals, goldfish preferences vary.
Vision.
Goldfish vision is among the most studied of all vision in fishes. Goldfish have four kinds of cone cells, which are respectively sensitive to different colors: red, green, blue and ultraviolet. The ability to distinguish between four different primary colors classifies them as tetrachromats.
Varieties of domesticated goldfish.
Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the "golden" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish live only in aquariums—they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the "wild" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. Currently, there are about 300 breeds recognized in China. The vast majority of goldfish breeds today originated from China. Some of the main varieties are:
Chinese goldfish classification.
Chinese tradition classifies goldfish into four main types. These classifications are not commonly used in the West.
Reproduction.
Goldfish may only grow to sexual maturity with enough water and the right nutrition. Most goldfish breed in captivity, particularly in pond settings. Breeding usually happens after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase gravid female goldfish (females carrying eggs), and prompt them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them.
Goldfish, like all cyprinids, are egg-layers. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation, typically dense plants such as "Cabomba" or "Elodea" or a spawning mop. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours.
Within a week or so, the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish color; until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish (or other fish and insects) in their environment.
Some highly bred goldfish can no longer breed naturally due to their altered shape. The artificial breeding method called "hand stripping" can assist nature, but can harm the fish if not done correctly. In captivity, adults may also eat young that they encounter.
Behavior and Intelligence.
Behavior.
Behavior can vary widely both because goldfish live in a variety of environments, and because their behavior can be conditioned by their owners.
Goldfish have strong associative learning abilities, as well as social learning skills. In addition, their visual acuity allows them to distinguish between individual humans. Owners may notice that fish react favorably to them (swimming to the front of the glass, swimming rapidly around the tank, and going to the surface mouthing for food) while hiding when other people approach the tank. Over time, goldfish learn to associate their owners and other humans with food, often "begging" for food whenever their owners approach.
Goldfish are gregarious, displaying schooling behavior, as well as displaying the same types of feeding behaviors. Goldfish may display similar behaviors when responding to their reflections in a mirror.
Goldfish that have constant visual contact with humans also stop considering them to be a threat. After being kept in a tank for several weeks, sometimes months, it becomes possible to feed a goldfish by hand without it shying away.
Goldfish have learned behaviors, both as groups and as individuals, that stem from native carp behavior. They are a generalist species with varied feeding, breeding, and predator avoidance behaviors that contribute to their success. As fish they can be described as "friendly" towards each other. Very rarely does a goldfish harm another goldfish, nor do the males harm the females during breeding. The only real threat that goldfish present "to each other" is competing for food. Commons, comets, and other faster varieties can easily eat all the food during a feeding before fancy varieties can reach it. This can lead to stunted growth or possible starvation of fancier varieties when they are kept in a pond with their single-tailed brethren. As a result, care should be taken to combine only breeds with similar body type and swim characteristics.
Intelligence.
Goldfish have a memory-span of at least three months and can distinguish between different shapes, colors and sounds. By using positive reinforcement, goldfish can be trained to recognize and to react to light signals of different colors or to perform tricks. Fish respond to certain colors most evidently in relation to feeding. Fish learn to anticipate feedings provided they occur at around the same time every day.
Domestication.
In ponds.
Goldfish are popular pond fish, since they are small, inexpensive, colorful and very hardy. In an outdoor pond or water garden, they may even survive for brief periods if ice forms on the surface, as long as there is enough oxygen remaining in the water and the pond does not freeze solid. Common goldfish, London and Bristol shubunkins, jikin, wakin, comet and some hardier fantail goldfish can be kept in a pond all year round in temperate and subtropical climates. Moor, veiltail, oranda and lionhead can be kept safely in outdoor ponds year-round only in more tropical climates and only in summer elsewhere.
Ponds small and large are fine in warmer areas (although it ought to be noted that goldfish can "overheat" in small volumes of water in summer in tropical climates). In frosty climes the depth should be at least to preclude freezing. During winter, goldfish become sluggish, stop eating and often stay on the bottom of the pond. This is normal; they become active again in the spring. Unless the pond is large enough to maintain its own ecosystem without interference from humans, a filter is important to clear waste and keep the pond clean. Plants are essential as they act as part of the filtration system, as well as a food source for the fish. Plants are further beneficial since they raise oxygen levels in the water.
Compatible fish include rudd, tench, orfe and koi, but the latter require specialized care. Ramshorn snails are helpful by eating any algae that grows in the pond. Without some form of animal population control, goldfish ponds can easily become overstocked. Fish such as orfe consume goldfish eggs.
Mosquito control.
Like some other popular aquarium fish, such as the guppy, goldfish and other carp are frequently added to stagnant bodies of water to reduce mosquito populations. They are used to prevent the spread of West Nile Virus, which relies on mosquitoes to migrate. However, introducing goldfish has often had negative consequences for local ecosystems.
In aquaria.
Like most carp, goldfish produce a large amount of waste both in their faeces and through their gills, releasing harmful chemicals into the water. Build-up of this waste to toxic levels can occur in a relatively short period of time, and can easily cause a goldfish's death. For common and comet varieties, each goldfish should have about of water. Fancy goldfish (which are smaller) should have about per goldfish. The water surface area determines how much oxygen diffuses and dissolves into the water. A general rule is have . Active aeration by way of a water pump, filter or fountain effectively increases the surface area.
The goldfish is classified as a coldwater fish, and can live in unheated aquaria at a temperature comfortable for humans. However, rapid changes in temperature (for example in an office building in winter when the heat is turned off at night) can kill them, especially if the tank is small. Care must also be taken when adding water, as the new water may be of a different temperature. Temperatures under about are dangerous to fancy varieties, though commons and comets can survive slightly lower temperatures. Extremely high temperatures (over can also harm goldfish. However, higher temperatures may help fight protozoan infestations by accelerating the parasite's life-cycle—thus eliminating it more quickly. The optimum temperature for goldfish is between and .
Like all fish, goldfish do not like to be petted. In fact, touching a goldfish can endanger its health, because it can cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed, exposing the fish’s skin to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites. However, goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time, and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers. The reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care. The lifespan of goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years.
If left in the dark for a period of time, goldfish gradually change color until they are almost gray. Goldfish produce pigment in response to light, in a similar manner to how human skin becomes tanned in the sun. Fish have cells called chromatophores that produce pigments which reflect light, and give the fish coloration. The color of a goldfish is determined by which pigments are in the cells, how many pigment molecules there are, and whether the pigment is grouped inside the cell or is spaced throughout the cytoplasm.
Because goldfish eat live plants, their presence in a planted aquarium can be problematic. Only a few aquarium plant species for example "Cryptocoryne" and "Anubias", can survive around goldfish, but they require special attention so that they are not uprooted. Plastic plants are often more durable, but the branches can irritate or harm a fish that touches one.
Controversy over proper treatment.
Some countries ban the sale of traditional fishbowls under animal welfare legislation due to the risk of stunting, deoxygenation and ammonia/nitrite poisoning in such a small environment. Because of their large oxygen needs and high waste output, such bowls are no longer considered appropriate housing for goldfish.
In many countries, carnival and fair operators commonly give goldfish away in plastic bags as prizes. In late 2005 Rome banned the use of goldfish and other animals as carnival prizes. Rome has also banned the use of "goldfish bowls", on animal cruelty grounds. In the United Kingdom, the government proposed banning this practice as part of its Animal Welfare Bill, though this has since been amended to only prevent goldfish being given as prizes to unaccompanied minors.
In Japan, during summer festivals and religious holidays (ennichi), a traditional game called goldfish scooping is played, in which a player scoops goldfish from a basin with a special scooper. Sometimes bouncy balls are substituted for goldfish.
Although edible, goldfish are rarely eaten. A fad among American college students for many years was swallowing goldfish as a stunt and as a fraternity initiation process. The first recorded instance was in 1939 at Harvard University. The practice gradually fell out of popularity over the course of several decades and is rarely practiced today.

American Composer Series

The American Composer Series is an ongoing performance series in the cabaret revue format, paying tribute to the greatest composers of popular American music on the American scene, particularly those composers associated with Tin Pan Alley. Launched by musical director Earl Wentz in 2000 with a tribute to Ray Henderson (composer of mega-hits “Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries,” “Bye Bye Blackbird,” “Button Up Your Overcoat,” “The Birth of the Blues” and others) titled "It’s the Cherries", the series has continued to add new shows to its repertoire at the rate of one or two per year. As of 2009, the American Composer Series had created some 15 original revue tributes, many of them returning for multiple runs over the years.
American Composers and Shows in the Series.
Each production in the series focuses on the work of one individual composer, working either alone or with a lyricist (or lyricists) by creating songs for the stage, screen, radio, or television. Composers saluted in the series so far include Milton Ager, Harold Arlen, Nacio Herb Brown, Hoagy Carmichael, Sammy Fain, Ray Henderson, Victor Herbert, James V. Monaco, Richard Rodgers (who required three separate shows to include his vast catalogue), Jule Styne, and Harry Warren.
Productions presented in the American Composer Series as of 2008 include:
In 2006, the producers of the series broke the format somewhat for two performances to pay tribute to the series’ founder, Earl Wentz, in “An American Composer Series Special Event.” 
Critical Response.
The series has received recognition especially for bringing to light forgotten treasures from the American Songbook and combining these with more recognizable old standards.
Latest Developments.
Playing primarily in New York City, the American Composer Series has recently begun to branch out to other performance locations. In 2007, it premiered "Vampin’ Lady: The Music of Milton Ager" in New Hope, Pennsylvania and announced plans to tour the production beginning in September, 2008, in association with Sixpence, Inc., producers of the "Vampin’ Lady" CD, featuring vocalist Joyce Moody with musical director Earl Wentz. Currently in development is a tribute to composer Jimmy McHugh, presently named "On the Sunny Side" from McHugh’s 1930 song On the Sunny Side of the Street.

Type 38 10 cm Cannon

The was a field gun used by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War I, the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. It was a licensed copy of a 1905 Krupp design. The Type 38 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 38th year of Emperor Meiji's reign (1905). By 1941 it was thoroughly obsolete and relegated to second-line service.
History and development.
Interest in the Krupp 105mm field gun was expressed by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in November 1904, during the height of the Russo-Japanese War. As warship production in Japan had priority during the 1890s, the technology and industrial infrastructure to construct medium or large caliber weapons was reserved for the Imperial Navy, as a consequence, the first twenty units were imported from Germany in 1905. Further units were produced under license in Japan by the Army's Osaka Arsenal under the direction of arms designer General Arisaka Nariakira from 1907, and began appearing in front line combat units from 1911.
After experience in the First World War, the Type 38 was upgraded to the "C" version, with a lengthened bore and modified carriage to permit a higher angle of fire. This modified version was already obsolete by the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but continued to be used by reserve and second-line forces through the end of World War II.
Design.
The Type 38 105mm Field Gun was a conventional design, with crew seats on the gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.
It was designed to be towed by a team of eight horses, or by an arms tractor.
The Type 38 105 mm Field Gun was capable of firing High-explosive, armor-piercing warhead, shrapnel, incendiary, smoke and illumination and gas shells.
Combat record.
Type 38 10cm field gun was initially at the Battle of Tsingtao in China during World War I. It was later used in rear echelon formations in the puppet state of Manchukuo and in various campaigns in mainland China during the Second Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s. Due to its obsolescence, it was not encountered by Allied forces in the Pacific. Some units were also used for shore defense in coastal artillery batteries in the Boso Peninsula, and Tokyo Bay in the Japanese home islands
In 1914, 120 guns were ordered by Russian Empire, converted to use 4.2-inch (107mm) Russian munition for 107 mm gun M1910. They received designation "42-line quick-firing gun Model 1905". These guns continued service in the Soviet Red Army until World War II (there were still 88 such guns in 1936).
Weapons captured by the Chinese remained in use in China by both the National Revolutionary Army of the Kuomintang government and Chinese Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party government at least through the Chinese Civil War.

Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's 50 metre freestyle

The women's 50 metre freestyle event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 15–17 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. 
Germany's Britta Steffen blasted a new Olympic record to strike a sprint freestyle double. She posted a time of 24.06, the second-fastest ever in the event, to erase Inge de Bruijn's 2000 record, and to hold off U.S. swimmer Dara Torres in a close race by a hundredth of a second (0.01). Returning from an eight-year absence, Torres became the first woman in Olympic history to swim past the age of 40. She established both a personal best and an American record of 24.07 to earn a silver medal and eleventh overall in her fifth Olympics since 1984. Meanwhile, Australian teenager Cate Campbell picked up a bronze in 24.17, edging out her teammate Lisbeth Trickett (24.25) by 0.08 of a second.
Netherlands' Marleen Veldhuis finished fifth with a time of 24.26, and was followed in the sixth spot by American Kara Lynn Joyce in 24.63. Veldhuis' teammate Hinkelien Schreuder (24.65) and Belarus' Aliaksandra Herasimenia (24.77) rounded out the finale.
Notable swimmers missed out the top 8 final, featuring Sweden's Therese Alshammar, four-time Olympian and silver medalist in Sydney eight years earlier, and Finland's Hanna-Maria Seppälä, fourth-place finalist in the 100 m freestyle.
