The Wave Pictures

The Wave Pictures are an English rock band consisting of David Tattersall (vocals and guitar), Franic Rozycki (bass guitar) and Jonny Helm (drums).
Background.
The band has its origins in a group called Blind Summit, which David and Franic formed with Hugh Noble in Wymeswold, near Loughborough in Leicestershire, in 1998. The band changed its name to the Wave Pictures and Hugh was eventually permanently replaced by Jonny Helm. They recorded and self-released a string of albums before settling in London.
"The Guardian" has described their work as "charming, witty pop songs shot through with Jonathan Richman's gawky glee and Suede's doomed provincial romanticism... They owe a certain debt to The Smiths, and Tattersall has Morrissey's knack of marrying the ridiculous and the sublime".
The band is closely linked to artists Darren Hayman (formerly of Hefner), Herman Dune, Daniel Johnston, Jeffrey Lewis and the Mountain Goats, all of whom they have collaborated with live and on record.

Levasseur PL.4

__NOTOC__
The Levasseur PL.4 was a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft produced in France in the 1920s. It was a conventional, single-bay biplane that carried a crew of three in tandem, open cockpits. Purchased by the Aéronavale to operate from the aircraft carrier "Béarn", it incorporated several safety features in case of ditching at sea. Apart from small floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing, the main units of the fixed, tailskid undercarriage could be jettisoned in flight, and the underside of the fuselage was given a boat-like shape and made watertight.

Alexis (sculptor)

Alexis (Ancient Greek: ) was an ancient Greek sculptor and statuary, mentioned by Pliny as one of the pupils of Polykleitos. Pausanias mentions an artist of the same name, a native of Sicyon, and father of the sculptor Cantharus. It cannot be satisfactorily settled whether these are the same, or different persons. Pliny's account implies that he had the elder Polykleitos in mind, in which case Alexis could not have flourished later than Olympiad 95 (400 BC), whereas Eutychides, under whom Cantharus studied, flourished about Olympiad 120 (300 BC). If the two were identical, as German classicist Friedrich Thiersch thinks, we must suppose either that Pliny made a mistake, and that Alexis studied instead under Polykleitos the Younger, or else that Eutychides, whose date is given by Pliny, was not the artist under whom Cantharus studied.

Treating

Treating, in law, is the act of serving food, drink, and other refreshments to influence people for political gain. In various countries, treating is considered a form of corruption, and is illegal as such. 
Treating, in a social context, came about with the birth of leisure time in the late nineteenth century. Young working class women took pride in going out and enjoying the city’s “cheap amusements”. Some notable cheap amusements included public dances, amusement parks, and nickelodeon movie theatres. 
Although young working class women liked to go out, this often proved difficult, as their wages were very low. Young women dealt with this issue in numerous ways. Some refrained from going out or limited going out to special occasions, while others depended on their male counterparts to finance their pleasures. The latter solution is referred to as “treating”. Historian Kathy Peiss has popularized this term in many of her scholarly works such as "Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York" (1986) and “Charity Girls and City Pleasures” (2004). 
The act of treating was an exchange between a man and a woman. A man would agree to pay for a woman’s outing in exchange for her company. Treating ranged from the more innocent to the more scandalous. Treating was seen as harmless when it was conducted between a “steady” couple and more risqué when it was performed on a casual basis. 
The women who engaged with this more risqué form of treating often reciprocated by performing sexual favors. These favors could be dancing, hugging, and kissing to full on sexual intercourse. The women who engaged with the more intense sexual acts were referred to as “charity girls”. These women did not see themselves as prostitutes but often walked a fine line between being treated and being paid for their sexual services.

Megagon

A megagon is a polygon with 1 million sides (from mega-).
Properties.
A regular megagon has an interior angle of 179.99964°.
The perimeter of a regular megagon inscribed in the unit circle is:
which is very close to 2π. In fact, for a circle the size of the Earth, with a circumference of 40,075 kilometres, the difference between the perimeter of the megagon and the circumference of the circle comes to less than 1/16 millimeters.
Philosophical application.
As with René Descartes' example of the chiliagon, the million-sided polygon has been used as an illustration of a well-defined concept that cannot be visualised.
The megagon is also used as an illustration of the convergence of regular polygons to a circle.

Ramnagar Fort

The Ramnagar Fort is a fortification in Ramnagar, Varanasi, India. It is located near the Ganges River on its eastern bank, opposite to the Tulsi Ghat. The structure was built in 1750 by Kashi Naresh Raja Balwant Singh ( a Bhumihar Brahmin ) with cream coloured "chunar" sandstone. It is in typical Mughal style of architecture with carved balconies, open courtyards, and pavilions. At present, the fort is not in a good shape. The fort and its museum are the repository of the history of the kings of Benares. It has been the home of Kashi Naresh since the eighteenth century. The current king and the resident of the fort is Anant Narayan Singh, who is also known as the Maharaja of Varanasi even though this royal title has been abolished since 1971.
Geography.
The fort is at a scenic location on the eastern right bank of the Ganges River, opposite to the Varanasi Ghats. It is from Varanasi and from the Benares Hindu University by pontoon. The pontoon bridge, which provides access to the fort, has rickety planks. During the monsoon season, the fort is accessible across the river by ferry service only. Boat ride to the fort from Dashashwamedh Ghat in Varanasi takes about an hour. A painted state barge with a twin emblems in the form of horses could be seen moored to the landing stage. There is a well laid out garden within the fort which forms the approach to the palace.
History.
The Ramnagar Fort was built by Kashi Naresh Raja Balwant Singh in 1750. Inscriptions on the outer ramparts of the fort date it to the seventeenth century.
Architecture.
The building was constructed with creamy-coloured "chunar" sandstone. It is built in typical Mughal style of architecture. The fort houses the Veda Vyasa Temple, a museum, and the king's residential complex. There is also a "Dakshin Mukhi" temple of Hanuman, which faces towards south.
The fort has been built on high ground, which is above the flood level. The fort has many carved balconies, open courtyards and pavilions. Only a part of the structure is open for public viewing as the rest of it is the residence of Kashi Naresh and his family. The flag on the fort is raised when the Maharaja is in residence in his palace fort. Within the fort, the palace has two white towers, which are accessed by a flight of steps. At the end of the flight of steps, there is an archway and many courtyards that lead to the white tower.
The private residence of the Maharaja is on one side of the tower while the Durbar Hall and reception rooms are on the other side. An inscription on the fort wall attests "Fortified House of the Rajah of Benares, with his state Boat."
Museum.
The museum is known as Saraswati Bhawan. The museum is in what used to be the Durbar Hall or the Public Audience Hall of the fort. It is well known for its unusual and rare collections of American vintage cars, bejeweled sedan chairs, ivory work, medieval costumes, gold and silver brocaded royal Palakis (Palanquins in the shape of a lotus flower). It has elephant saddles carved out of silver, jewellery, costumes made of "kimkhwa" silk (finest product of the weavers of Varanasi), an impressive armoury hall with swords, old guns from Africa, Burma and Japan. The old armoured matchlocks, ornate hookahs, daggers, portraits of Maharajas, black musical instruments which have turned white due to neglect of maintenance and there is a rare astronomical clock. This clock shows not only the time but also the year, month, week and day, and the astronomical details of the Sun, Moon and other planets. This clock was made in 1852 by the Astronomer at the Court of the Royal Palace of Varanasi. In addition, manuscripts, especially religious writings, are housed in the museum. Also included is a precious handwritten manuscript by Goswami Tulsidas. Many books illustrated in the Mughal miniatures style, with beautifully designed covers are also part of the collections. There are five hundred and thirty-five illustrations expressing Islamic ethos, each having a decorative border with ornate floral designs or cartouches.
Festivals.
The fort palace appears very vibrant and colourful when beatified during the one month long Ram Lila festival where different episodes of Ramayana are enacted. On this occasion, a colourful pageant or procession of Ramayana epic is presented as part of the Dussehra celebrations that is held in October under the patronage of the Maharaja. These celebrations are concluded on the last day, the Dashami day (10th day of bright half of Lunar month) as per Hindu Calendar (October as per Gregorian Calendar, with the burning of the effigy of Ravana, the demon king, and his associates, which signifies victory of good over evil. The festival also includes a procession of various antique displays of Royal possessions. The Maharaja continues his family tradition of attending the annual month-long Ram Lila drama festival held in the streets behind the fort by riding on a decorated elephant at the head of the procession. In olden days, the drama was performed by the native regiments and the epic story of Ramayana scripture was read through the month-long festival. Other festivals held in the fort are in the month of Magh (January and February) in front of the Veda Vyasa temple where pilgrims visit Ramnagar. In the month of Phagun, (February and March) a festival called Raj Mangal is held in the fort with a procession of boats with people, dancing and singing; it starts from the Asi Ghat, goes along the river in front of the fort.
In popular culture.
Because of its scenic location on the banks of the Ganges, the fort and the palace are frequently used as an outdoor shooting location for films. The film titled "Banaras" is one of the popular movies shot here.
It was the 7th Pit Stop of The Amazing Race 18.

LOV-1

The LOV-1 (Cr:Lako Oklopno Vozilo/EN:Light Armoured Vehicle) is a wheeled armoured personnel carrier currently in use with the Croatian army.
History.
During the Croatian War of Independence, the Croatian army lacked proper light armoured personnel carrier. The Croatian Ministry of Defense asked local firms to provide a solution for a light, fast and reliable armoured personnel carrier which could be produced quickly and in large quantities, without the need to import parts from abroad due to the UN Arms embargo which was imposed on Croatia at the time.
A local firm from Rijeka developed a basic armoured personnel carrier based on the HV 4x4 TK-130 T-7 military truck. The Army ordered 50 LOV-1 vehicles in 1993/94, with the first vehicle being delivered in late 1994. 
A total of 72 vehicles were manufactured in various configurations, today only 45 vehicles remain. 
There are long term plans to replace the LOV-1 with Patria AMV and Iveco LMV counterparts, but the LOV-1 is currently set to remain in service with the Croatian Army for the short term.
Combat history.
The LOV-1 saw action in the Croatian War of Independence, particularly in Operations Flash and Storm.

<doc id="19415143" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19415143" title="Auditory agnosia">
Auditory agnosia

Auditory agnosia is a form of agnosia that manifests itself primarily in the inability to recognize or differentiate between sounds. It is not a defect of the ear or "hearing", but a neurological inability of the brain to process sound meaning. It is a disruption of the "what" pathway in the brain. Persons with auditory agnosia can physically hear the sounds and describe them using unrelated terms, but are unable to recognize them. They might describe the sound of some environmental sounds, such as a motor starting, as resembling a lion roaring, but would not be able to associate the sound with "car" or "engine", nor would they say that it "was" a lion creating the noise. Auditory agnosia is caused by damage to the secondary and tertiary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe of the brain.
Types of auditory agnosia.
There are three primary distinctions of auditory agnosia that fall into two categories. 
Semantic-associative.
This type of auditory agnosia is caused by lesions to the left hemisphere of the brain, specifically the temporal lobes and Wernicke's area.
"Linguistic (or verbal information or Wernicke's) agnosia" indicates that the subject can't comprehend words, although they can understand words using sign language and words from reading books, and are themselves capable of speech (and even of deriving meaning from non-linguistic communication e.g. body language) the particular sounds associated to each word are meaningless.
Discriminative.
This type of auditory agnosia is caused by lesions to the right hemisphere of the brain. 
"Classical (or pure) auditory agnosia" is an inability to process environmental sounds, such as animal noises, industrial noises, or the like. An airplane roaring overhead would not be understood to be related to the idea of "airplane"—indeed, the person would not even think to look up.
"Interpretive or receptive agnosia (amusia)" is an inability to understand music. The term "amusia" covers a broad spectrum: from those with a mere deficit of rhythmic ability (mild dysrhythmia), to those with heavy all-encompassing amusia, including the recently coined "distimbria"; sufferers regard music as simply "noise", often compared to drainpipes or drills, or other invasive forms of background noise. Vocal singing can be understood, but is simply seen as "odd tone of voice". The standard is considered to be that amusics with a "normal" intensity of amusia are cortically unable to distinguish pitch changes of less than three semitones (when it includes a pitch-deficit; it is contentious whether without this symptom it can be considered amusia). They may appreciate or enjoy listening to or performing music, but some can not tolerate it or find it irritating.
Ways to Test for Auditory Agnosia.
Meaningless Sounds Discrimination Test.
In this test subjects are presented with two consecutive synthetic noises (usually with a two second interval) and asked whether the noises are the same or different. Those with damage to the right hemisphere have significantly lower scores on this test than those of controls and those with left hemisphere damage.
Meaningful Sounds Identification Test.
In this test subjects are presented a natural sound followed by four pictures. The subject is then asked to point to the picture that best represents the sound they just heard. Those with damage to the left hemisphere do significantly poorer on this test than controls and those with right hemisphere damage.
Special Cases.
A seventy-four year old man named "M" had a special case of auditory agnosia. "M" suffered from, "unilateral left posterior temporal and parietal damage", (Saygin, Leech, & Dick, 2010, p. 107) including Wernicke's Area. These areas of the brain are associated with language processing. He had a stroke when he was 62 and went through intensive speech therapy for twelve weeks to help him recover. He was able to regain his language capacity, but when tested at age 74, he had great difficulty in recognizing non-verbal environmental sounds. He did not have either verbal comprehension deficits nor peripheral hearing problems (p. 107). His condition was very rare because auditory agnosia for nonverbal sounds is usually associated with the right side of the brain. "M" was able to identify familiar Christmas songs and some animal sounds. When he heard music, he couldn't distinguish individual instruments or voices, but he knew it was music. fMRI scans show that after the stroke, his brain re-wired itself through neuronal compensation to account for the damage.

Kinnaird Ouchterlonie

Kinnaird 'Ken' Robb Richardson Ouchterlonie (born in Dundee) was a Scottish footballer who played as an inside forward.
Ouchterlonie, whose brother Willie was also a footballer, began his career with local side Lochee Harp before joining Celtic just before the start of the Second World War. During the early 1940s, Ouchterlonie was not retained by the club and he featured as a trialist for Dundee United in March 1943. Ouchterlonie didn't become a signed player until September 1948, by which time he had featured for rivals Dundee and Ayr United, and made his début at inside right, playing regularly for the remainder of the year. After spending the first few months of 1949 in the reserves, Ouchterlonie was released from Tannadice Park in May 1949.
After retiring from football, Ouchterlonie ran a shoemaking and shoe repair business, and was based in the Hawkhill area of Dundee. He and his beloved wife Charlote (Lottie) Ouchterlonie, together with children Aileen, Kay and Kenneth, moved to Canvey Island in Essex. Ken joined Calor Gas as an Engineer until retiring. He died in December 1995.

Michael Sachs (judge)

Sir Michael Alexander Geddes Sachs (8 April 1932 - 25 September 2003) was the first English solicitor to be appointed as a High Court judge. Since his appointment in 1993, only three other solicitors have been appointed to the High Court - Lawrence Collins in 2000, Henry Hodge in 2004 and Gary Hickinbottom in 2008.
Early life.
Sachs was born in Glasgow, the son of a GP and a nurse. He was raised in Penrith and educated at Sedbergh School. He read law at Manchester University and took his articles at Slater, Heelis & Co in Manchester. He was a supporter of Manchester United F.C.
Career.
After qualifying as a solicitor, and then undertaking National Service, he returned to Slater Heelis in 1959 to work on crime, family, personal injury and common law matters. He became a partner at Slater Heelis in 1962. He acted for defendants charged with offences relating to IRA bombings in the 1970s. He was president of Manchester Law Society in 1978-9, a member of the Law Society Council from 1979 to 1984, and chairman of the Law Society's standing committee on criminal law from 1982 to 1984. 
His judicial career began in 1977, when was appointed as a deputy circuit judge. He became a recorder on 9 July 1980. He left his firm and retired from private practice in 1984, on being appointed a full circuit judge. He worked for 18 months in Liverpool and then in Manchester, mostly on criminal work. 
After a rally in 1989, at which Dr Kalim Siddiqui, director of the Muslim Institute in London, suggested that there should be a vote on whether Salman Rushdie should die for his blasphemous novel "The Satanic Verses", Sachs ordered the BBC to give their film of the rally to the police.
In 1989 and 1990, he presided at the 16-week trial of Kevin Taylor and three other men on charges of conspiracy to defraud. After Sachs ruled that some of the prosecution's evidence was inadmissible, the trial ended with the prosecution offering no further evidence, and Taylor was acquitted. Taylor later claimed he had been targeted for malicious prosecution, as a way to smear his friend, the former Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester John Stalker, who had been conducting an inquiry into the Royal Ulster Constabulary "shoot to kill" policy. 
High Court career.
He was appointed a High Court judge on 21 June 1993, and assigned to the Queen's Bench Division, receiving the customary knighthood on 27 October 1993. He also became an honorary bencher at the Middle Temple and an honorary member of the Law Society that year, and received an honorary doctorate of law from Manchester University in 1994. He also occasionally sat as a member of the Court of Appeal. 
In June 1993, he presided at the five-month trial of 11 men for their parts in the 1990 Strangeways Prison riot, sentencing them to a total of 88 years in prison. He presided at the trial of a garage owner from Stockport in 1994, sentencing him to life imprisonment for murdering two MoT inspectors. He sent a farmer from Totnes to prison for three months in December 1995 for contempt of court, after the farmer had concealed his illegally built house by removing one floor and then covered it over with earth and grass, rather complying with a court order to demolish it. 
In 1997, after the trial of a former psychiatric nurse for the manslaughter of her handicapped 14-year-old daughter, he passed an 18-month suspended sentence and supervision order.
Private life.
He married Patricia Conroy in 1957. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1980. He was survived by his wife and their two sons and two daughters.

Omzoor [http://www.mangalorean.com/ekata/cdetail.php?chid=107] is situated at a distance of 14 km from Mangalore to the north east and is surrounded by Neermarga, Belloor, Modankap, Fermai parishes.
Omzoor is also known as Arkul and Mermajal. This parish is one of the three ancient parishes of the Mangalore diocese. In 1568, a Franciscan priest built a church at Arkula, where presently Nitya Sahaaya Maatha High School is situated. This place is very near to the present church structure. Arkula church was later closed and in between 1601 and 1625 it was re-established and dedicated to the Holy Family.
Bangera kings of Nandavar donated the land to build the present Holy Family Church at Omzoor. After the return of the Christians from the captivity at Srirangapattana in 1799, the church was rededicated and Fr Joachim Manuel Mendis became the first parish priest of the re-dedicated church. Omazoor is the Mother Church of Belloor (1920), Kelarai (1935) and Neermarga (1968). A shed that was built at Fermai by Fr Andrew D’Souza was officially erected in 1999 as chapel and later, on May 20, 2004 into a parish. He has built a presbytery cum hall at the basement and a church above it.
During the last 150 years the church building has undergone many renovations, additions and other improvements according to the needs of the time. Fr Aloysius Rodrigues (1953-1973) renovated and remodelled the building and it was blessed on November 27, 1959. Fr Andrew D’Souza (1997) renovated the church façade and changed the flooring. He also repaired and added a few rooms to the presbytery. He obtained w acres of land from Gilbert D’Souza of Kodman and from the family of Archbishop Alphonsus Mathias at Kodman free of cost with a view of building a church there.

Triumph Motorcycles Ltd

Triumph Motorcycles Ltd is the largest British motorcycle manufacturer; it was established in 1984 by John Bloor after the original company Triumph Engineering went into receivership. The new company (initially Bonneville Coventry Ltd) continued Triumph's record of motorcycle production since 1902. In the year to 30 June 2012, the company, which is the United Kingdom's largest motorcycle manufacturer, produced 49,000 motorcycles and employed 1,600 staff.
History.
When Triumph Engineering went into receivership in 1983, John Bloor bought the name and manufacturing rights from the Official Receiver. The new company's manufacturing plant and its designs were not able to compete against the Japanese, so Bloor decided against relaunching Triumph immediately. Initially, production of the old Bonneville was continued under licence by Les Harris of Racing Spares, in Newton Abbot, Devon, to bridge the gap between the end of the old company and the start of the new company. For five years from 1983, about 14 were built a week in peak production. In the USA, owing to problems with liability insurance, the Harris Bonnevilles were never imported.
Bloor set to work assembling the new Triumph, hiring several of the group's former designers to begin work on new models. The team visited Japan on a tour of its competitors' facilities and became determined to adopt Japanese manufacturing techniques and especially new-generation computer-controlled machinery. In 1985, Triumph purchased a first set of equipment to begin working, in secret, on its new prototype models. By 1987, the company had completed its first engine. In 1988, Bloor funded the building of a new factory at a site in Hinckley, Leicestershire. Bloor put between £70 million and £100 million into the company between purchasing the brand and breaking even in 2000.
At the same time as production capacity increased, Bloor established a new network of export distributors. He has previously created two subsidiary companies, Triumph Deutschland GmbH and Triumph France SA. In 1994 Bloor created Triumph Motorcycles America Ltd.
At 21.00 on 15 March 2002, as the company was preparing to celebrate its 100th anniversary as a motorcycle maker, its main factory was destroyed by a fire which began at the rear of the facility. At the height of the blaze over 100 firefighters were tackling the fire which destroyed most of the manufacturing capacity. Nevertheless, the company, which by then employed more than 650, quickly rebuilt the facility and returned to production by September that year. Furthermore, in 2003, Triumph began construction on a new sub-assembly manufacturing facility in Thailand, opened in 2006 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. In September 2008, Triumph announced that they were expanding their Thailand factory to increase capacity to over 130,000 motorcycles.
The Triumph Group announced sales of 37,400 units in the financial year ending 30 June 2006. This represented a growth of 18% over the 31,600 produced in 2005. Company turnover (revenues) rose 13% to £200 million ($370 million), but net profit remained static at around £10.3 million due to recent investment in production facilities. In June 2009 Lord Digby Jones, the former Minister of State for Trade, become chairman of Triumph motorcycles (Hinckley) Ltd and the Thunderbird twin-cylinder cruiser was announced.
The Group turnover increased by 11% from £312.4 million in 2010 to £345.3 million in 2011 and unit sales of motorcycles increased by 7% from 45,501 to 48,684. This increase in unit sales can be largely attributed to the introduction of incremental models to the range. The operating profit before interest and tax grew from £15.1 million to £22.3 million due to strong sales of motorcycles and related products, benefiting from improved use of working capital and continued focus upon the cost base. During 2011 Triumph launched three new motorcycles: the Tiger Explorer, Speed Triple R and the Steve McQueen Special, 
successfully bucking the trend of the global downturn in motorcycle sales.
Model range.
A range of new 750 cc and 900 cc triple-cylinder bikes and 1000 cc and 1200 cc four-cylinder bikes were launched at the September 1990 Cologne Motorcycle Show. The motorcycles used famous model names from the glory days of Meriden Triumph and were first made available to the public between March (Trophy 1200 being the first) and September 1991. All used a modular liquid cooled DOHC engine design in a common large diameter steel backbone frame. The modular design was to ensure that a variety of models could be offered whilst keeping production costs under control – an idea originally put forward, in air-cooled form, in the early 1970s by Bert Hopwood but not implemented by the then BSA-Triumph company. 
The first models, known generically as the 'T300's, all used a common piston diameter (76mm) in a common wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved through the use of two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released - and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model - the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900 cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted at the front of the engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts - unique at the time - mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or 'sprag' clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle. 
The range was largely revised in 1997 with the release of the T500 range, followed by a light-weight four-cylinder 600 cc sports TT600. The 600 was a major design departure and initially received a poor press: "unpleasant at low revs due to a lethargic and unpredictable throttle response, with anonymous styling". As sales built, the big fours were phased out of the lineup and parallel twins and triples became the marketing and development focus of Triumph's marketing strategy. Triumph also decided to exploit demand for retro motorcycles with modern engineering. The Triumph Thunderbird 900 exploited the styling cues of the 'old' Triumph's legendary designer, Edward Turner whilst retaining the modern triple engine. The 790 and 865 cc versions of the Triumph Bonneville and Thruxton look and sound original but internally they have modern valves and counterbalance shafts.
For their contemporary range, the triple is Hinckley Triumph's trademark, filling a niche between European and American twins and four-cylinder Japanese machinery. The triple Rocket III cruiser was introduced in 2004. The first 300 Rocket III models were already sold before they were produced, and there was a long waiting list for Rockets into 2005. 
On 21 July 2008, Triumph held a Global Dealer Conference where new models for 2009 were launched, including the official announcement of the parallel twin-cylinder Thunderbird.
Triumph's best selling bike is the 675 cc Street Triple. In 2010 they launched the Triumph Tiger 800 and Tiger 800 XC, dual-sport motorcycles, which uses an 800 cc engine derived from the Street Triple, and is designed to compete directly with the market leading BMW F800GS.
In 2012, the Tiger 800 was joined by the shaft-driven Triumph Tiger Explorer.
Triple Connection & celebrity marketing.
In 1995, the Triple Connection clothing range and the accessories range of products were launched. Triumph made a commercial decision to design all their own motorcycle clothing rather than license other producers. In the 21st century, Triumph marketed lines of clothing highlighting their association with celebrities strongly associated with the old Triumph marque such as Marlon Brando, Bob Dylan, James Dean, Elvis Presley and particularly, Steve McQueen, for whom the company named a special edition of their Bonneville motorcycle.

Kaletski’s first love was always painting. As a child he won several art competitions. At the time, in Soviet Russia only officially designated artists were allowed to legally sell their work, which was forbidden to be abstract, surreal or critical of Soviet life. Kaletski refused to paint in a style of socialist realism. But he painted anyway and went underground, where he found a thriving culture that provided him with an audience for his art and songs. In the Moscow underground Kaletski was working on the series of watercolors which he was selling to the foreigners on the black market. 
Leaving the USSR Kaletski carried with him these watercolors. During that time in the Soviet Union, the works of unsanctioned or “non conformist” painters were forbidden and exhibiting as an outsider was considered a serious crime. Forgoing other necessary belongings, the artist had to pay for the release of his own pieces. When Alexander arrived to America his watercolors were immediately exhibited in many Universities around the United States, constituting some of the earliest non-conformist art to be viewed in America. His works surprised audiences as they showed unexpectedly that behind the Iron Curtain existed not only gloom and sadness, but also humor, beauty and hope. 
First years in America an artist without money to buy paint or canvas, Alexander was drawn by his natural talent for improvisation to the thousands of cardboard boxes that litter the streets of the Big Apple. Kaletski became enthralled with the high quality of disposable packing materials in the USA. For the artist, those boxes provided unique, if unusual, components for the creative process. Beginning with commercial cardboard packaging he collaged the material adding line and color. The resulting artwork reveals, informs, provokes, but most often, amuses the viewer.
Alexander Kaletski was the inaugural exhibition for Dillon Gallery when it opened in Soho in 1994. In the last seventeen years the gallery has presented numerous exhibitions of the artist’s works, the most acclaimed being his Cardboard People exhibition which opened in 1996. The show became an instant success. Since then Alexander Kaletski has regularly exhibited his paintings in museum exhibitions in the USA and abroad (Austria, England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Russia, and Japan) presenting to the audience the variety of styles, techniques and concepts.

Heikki Lunta

Heikki Lunta is the embodiment of the Finnish snow god character, who originated in the mythology of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 
The character of Heikki Lunta is a product of the heavy Finnish-American presence in Michigan's Upper Peninsula combined with a tremendous annual snowfall.
History.
David Riutta created "Heikki Lunta" (the name translates to Hank Snow in English) in 1970. When an upcoming snowmobile race hosted by the Range Snowmobile Club of Atlantic Mine, Michigan was endangered by the lack of snowfall, Riutta, a worker at WMPL in Hancock, aired the "Heikki Lunta Snowdance Song." The song goes on to ask "Heikki Lunta," the Finnish snow god, for snow in time for the race. According to local tales, the snow fell and fell, until there was too much. People were superstitious that Riutta's song had caused too much snow for the race, so in response to public outcry, Riutta recorded a separate track entitled, "Heikki Lunta Go Away." The 45 showcased each song on alternate sides.
The Negaunee Irontown Association created its own Heikki Lunta Winterfest, held every January in Negaunee, MI. It includes a Fishing derby, a Craft bazaar, a bonfire and fireworks over Teal Lake at Dusk. It originally opened with a Snowblower parade. http://www.negauneeirontown.org/Heikki_Lunta_Winterfest.html

VF Ivano Dibona

Sentiero ferrato Ivano Dibona is a walking route along the Zurlon ridge, the main crest on Cristallo, a mountain group in the Italian Dolomites, northeast of Cortina d'Ampezzo, in the province of Belluno, Veneto, Italy.
History.
The Ivano Dibona is a restored historical route, which was used by Italian troops during World War I. The route was explored in the 1960s by Freddy and Ivano Dibona, subsequently made safe for tourists, and reopened in September 1970. It was named after Ivano Dibona, who had perished on Cristallo in 1968. Remains of military constructions from 1915 to 1917 are still visible along the route: casemate, barracks and ladders.
Route details.
The route starts from "Forcella Staunies" (2,919 m), the top of the cable car at Cristallo's south side, and ends at "Rifugio Ospitale" in the Val Felizon. It is not a climbing route, but follows the mountain ridge, via ladders, tunnels and bridges. The exposed parts are supplied with steel wires typical for via ferratas, while the parts that originally were difficult are supplied with remedies to make them accessible for walkers.
From the start at "Forcella Staunies" is some upward ladder climbing, a short tunnel, and then the bridge "Ponte Cristallo", 27 meters long, and the longest via ferrata suspension bridge in the Dolomites. The bridge was shown in the action film Cliffhanger from 1993.
The peak "Cristallino d'Ampezzo" (3,008 m) can be climbed via a short side route from the main Ivano Dibona.
Further the route goes down to "Forcella Grande", and passes "Forcella Padeon", "Forcella Alta", and "Forcella Bassa", and along the ridge to the peaks "Zurlon" (2,363 m), and "Col di Stombi" (2,168 m), and finally down to "Ospitale".

List of Los Angeles Dodgers Opening Day starting pitchers

The Los Angeles Dodgers are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Los Angeles, California. They play in the National League West division. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Dodgers have used 21 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 56 seasons in Los Angeles. The 21 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 23 wins, 25 losses and 8 no decisions.
The Dodgers started playing in Los Angeles in 1958, after moving from Brooklyn. The first Opening Day game for the Dodgers in Los Angeles was played in San Francisco against the San Francisco Giants on April 15, 1958. California native Don Drysdale was the Dodgers' Opening Day starting pitcher that day, in a game the Dodgers lost 8–0. Dodgers starting pitchers won both of their Opening Day starts in their first home ballpark in Los Angeles, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Their Opening Day record in their current home park, Dodger Stadium, which opened in 1962, is ten wins, ten losses and five no decisions. That gives the Los Angeles Dodgers' Opening Day starting pitchers a total home record of twelve wins, ten losses and five no decisions. Their record in Opening Day road games is 10 wins, 14 losses and 2 no decisions.
Drysdale would make seven Opening Day starts for the Dodgers between 1958 and 1969, a team record he shares with Don Sutton who accumulated them from 1972 through 1978. Fernando Valenzuela, Ramón Martínez and Orel Hershiser have had at least four Opening Day starts, with six, five and four, respectively. Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, who won three Cy Young Awards during the 1960s, only made one Opening Day start for the Dodgers, in 1964. Drysdale also holds the Los Angeles Dodgers record for most wins as an Opening Day starter, with five wins against two losses. Sutton has four wins and two losses, and one no decision. 
Koufax (1964), Chan Ho Park (2001), Brad Penny (2008) and Hiroki Kuroda (2009) are the only Los Angeles Dodgers Opening Day starting pitchers to never lose an Opening Day start, all having won their only Opening Day start. Valenzuela, Martinez and Derek Lowe share the Los Angeles Dodgers record for most Opening Day losses, with three. The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series championship in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981 and 1988. Drysdale (1959, 1963 and 1965), and Fernando Valenzuela (1981 and 1988) were the Dodgers' Opening Day starting pitchers those years. The Dodgers' starting pitcher won the Opening Day game in 1963, 1965 and 1981, but lost in 1959 and 1988.

Hazel Crane

Hazel Crane (1951–2003) was a prominent socialite, businesswoman and posthumous memoirist in South Africa. She was assassinated on 10 November 2003 near her mansion home in the plush Northern Johannesburg suburb of Abbotsford, the same suburb where controversial mining magnate Brett Kebble was murdered later in 2005. 
Early life.
Born as Hazel Elizabeth Magee in Belfast, Northern Ireland, she emigrated to then Rhodesia as a child and later to South Africa in adult life. In South Africa she was involved in several philanthropic committees and projects, such as the educational sponsorship of poor students.
Later life.
Crane was previously married to Anthony Crane, although he was killed at age 25 in combat in the Rhodesian Bush War. The couple already had one child, and at the time of her husband's death, Crane was pregnant with their second child. She later had a tumultuous marriage with alleged Israeli mafia boss Shai Avissar. At the time of his murder in 1999, the couple were estranged.
She was a close friend of Winnie Mandela, who attended her funeral and was the chief witness in her wedding to Avissar. Crane accompanied Mandela during her hearings before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
Death and legacy.
Crane was shot dead in her car in November 2003, while traveling to the Johannesburg High Court to attend the trial of alleged Israeli mafia member Lior Saat, accused of murdering Crane's estranged husband near Sunninghill, Gauteng in 1999. Crane had been traveling with a female companion, who was shot in the hand, but police determined that the incident was a "direct attack" on Crane's life, who was shot in the head, leg, chest and arm. It later emerged that Crane had been expected to testify in the murder case against Saat and a source close to Crane said that she knew too much, being able to identify and implicate a number of figures in the Saat murder case. She was the third state witness in the Saadt murder trial to be murdered; Giulio Bascelli was shot in the head in a deserted garage soon after Avassi's death in 1999 and Carlo Binne was shot dead at the Gecko Lounge, a Johannesburg nightclub, in April 2001.
Prior to her death, Crane was working with a British journalist, David Kray on her memoirs. The biography, "Hazel Crane: Testimony from Beyond the Grave" received a posthumous release in 2004 and contained several shocking details about the socialite's colourful past. The book details Crane's own secret life of crime. She made her fortune by smuggling diamonds and emeralds, making blackmarket currency deals, owning a striptease joint and selling hard-core pornography. She also tells of how she would tuck emeralds into her beehive hairdo or pack them into her son's nappies for smuggling. Prior to a crime career, she trained as a State Registered Nurse in Rhodesia and in later life was an active businesswoman.

Vladas Česiūnas

Vladislovas "Vladas" Česiūnas (born March 15, 1940 in Vyšnialaukiai, Jonava District Municipality) is a Soviet-born Lithuanian sprint canoer who competed in the early 1970s. He won one Olympic medal and six ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships medals during his career. He later became known for his role in "The Česiūnas Affair" when he defected from the 1979 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in Duisburg, West Germany (now Germany near Düsseldorf) only to return to the Soviet Union afterwards for his "misconduct".
Sporting career.
At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Česiūnas won gold in the C-2 1000 m with Yuri Lobanov. He also won six canoe sprint world championship medals with four golds (C-2 1000 m: 1974, C-2 10000 m: 1973, 1974, 1975), one silver (C-2 1000 m: 1973), and one bronze (C-1 1000 m: 1971).
The Česiūnas Affair.
At the 1979 canoe sprint World Championships in Duisburg, West Germany, Česiūnas attended the event as a spectator. During the event he vanished, the first in a series of defections that would later include principal ballet dancers Alexander Godunov, Leonid Kozlov and Valentina Kozlov, and figure skaters Oleg Protopopov and Ludmila Belousova. 
However, while he was studying German in Dortmund, KGB agents allegedly swooped in and took Česiūnas back to the Soviet Union. 
The Soviets claimed that Česiūnas had met a woman named Ursula Vorkhert who invited to spend the night with him and then drugged him up. Česiūnas later appeared with anti-Communist Lithuanians and being asked to speak out in favor of a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, two months before the Soviet's invasion of Afghanistan and almost six months before American President Jimmy Carter's actual boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. 
Česiūnas made his way to the Soviet Embassy in Bonn - "not without incident" and returned to the Soviet Union and imprisoned with a fractured skull according to Kurt Rebmann, West Germany's chief federal public prosecutor in 1979. Another reason the Soviets were concerned also had to do with a possible book Česiūnas had planned to publish on doping in the Soviet Union prior to the 1980 Summer Olympics. The Soviets later toned down their rhetoric on the incident, stating Česiūnas had "got into dubious company" while the West Germans continued to maintain he had been kidnapped. 
In 2002 telephone interview with the "Los Angeles Times", Česiūnas stated he returned from West Germany voluntary but was threatened by Soviet officials with fifteen years of hard labor in a coal mine for his defection and was not imprisoned only due to the upcoming Summer Olympics in Moscow. As a result, Česiūnas was demoted from his custom agent position to being a civilian coach at a children's sports school which paid only a third the salary of his customs position.
Later in life.
Česiūnas earned two presidential decrees from Lithuania after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. They were the Order of the Cross of Vytis ("Cross of the Knight") and the Commemorative Medal of 13 January. In 2000, Česiūnas was informed that Vorkhert, whom he met in Lithuania in 1998 after the country's 1991 independence, had died at 75. Česiūnas later returned to his customs position, becoming head of shifts for Lithuanian customs as of 2002. He also received monthly pensions from the Soviet and Lithuanian Olympic Committee of USD 30 and USD 120, respectively.

Church of St. John of Beverley, Whatton

The Church of St. John of Beverley, Whatton is a parish church in the Church of England in Whatton in the Vale, Nottinghamshire, dedicated to St John of Beverley. The church is Grade II* listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as a particularly significant building of more than local interest.
Building.
The church is medieval, dating from the 14th century, but little survived the restorations of 1846, 1866–67 and 1870. It consists now of a chancel rebuilt in 1846, a central tower and steeple rebuilt in 1870, and a nave with north and south aisles and north and south porches. The only remaining Romanesque work is the former south transept arch of the tower, which was moved to the north side during the 19th-century restoration. The nave is in Early English style. There is also a chapel dedicated to the memory of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, who was born and raised in Aslockton but worshipped here.The two corbel heads in the chapel date from about 1300 and depict King David and an angel.
Effigies and features.
Apart from interesting architectural detail (the lower part of a now redundant newel staircase, the Decorated recess containing a statue of a former incumbent [1304–10], and a double piscina), there is a late 14th-century effigy of a Knight Templar in armour, another of a cross-legged knight of the early 14th century, and a tablet in memory of Thomas Cranmer, father of the archbishop, who was born in Aslockton, then a chapelry of Whatton, in 1489.
The font dates from 1662. One of the 19th-century stained-glass windows, depicting Saints Peter and John and Jesus, was designed by Edward Burne-Jones. The peal of five bells were cast by Henry Oldfield of Nottingham in 1590 and 1618. An early clock was installed in 1683 by Richard Roe. This was replaced in 1910.
Parish status.

Cyril VI Tanas

Patriarch Cyril VI Tanas, also known as Cyril VI of Antioch (1680–1760), became the first leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church following the schism of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch in 1724. Cyril re-established communion with the Roman Catholic Church.
Life.
Seraphim Tanas was born in Damascus in 1680 and he was the nephew of Euthymios Saifi, bishop of Sidon. On August 3, 1701 he arrived in Marseille, France and from 1702 to 1710 he studied in the College of the Propaganda in Rome. Returned in Syria he was ordained priest by his uncle and he was distinguished for his sermons. He was appointed "Preacher of the Patriarchate of Antioch" by Patriarch Cyril V Zaim.
Like many of his fellow clerics Seraphim Tanas favored re-establishing communion with the Roman Catholic Church. He was elected in 1724 by the Melkites of Damascus as the new Patriarch of Antioch, and was consecrated as Cyril VI in the patriarchal cathedral of Damascus on October 1, 1724 by Neophytos Nasri, bishop of Saidnaya assisted by Basile Finas, bishop of Baias and by Euthymius Fadel, bishop of Zahle and Forzol. As Cyril was a prominent pro-Westerner, the Orthodox Patriarch Jeremias III of Constantinople, felt his authority was challenged. Jeremias declared Cyril's election to be invalid, excommunicated him, and appointed Sylvester of Antioch (1696–1766), a young Greek monk, to the patriarchal See of Antioch. Jeremias consecrated bishop Sylvester in Istanbul on October 8, 1724. 
The sultan withdrew the recognition initially conferred on Cyril, who was forced to flee as emissaries of Sylvester arrived from Constantiople with a mandate for his arrest. Cyril took refuge at the Holy Savior Monastery near Sidon, located in modern-day Lebanon. Cyril's safety there was guaranteed by the Shehab emirs. Sylvester unleashed a hard persecution against all who elected or supported Cyril: many people were exiled and all churches were taken by Sylvester's party. This persecution strengthened the faith of the Catholic Melkites who, even without a formal hierarchy, continued to increase in number meeting in secret places and celebrating the Divine Liturgy in homes at night.
Although the populace of Aleppo was mainly pro-Catholic in sentiment, the people initially supported Sylvester. However, Sylvester exacerbated divisions with his heavy-handed rule of the church, and many Melkites chose to acknowledge Cyril VI as patriarch instead. The people united against Sylvester, forcing him to flee Aleppo. The Greek domination over the Byzantine Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch lasted until 1899. 
Notwithstanding the many requests by Cyril for recognition, the Papacy moved with great caution and took six years to recognize Cyril as the legitimate Patriarch of Antioch. The decision was made by Pope Benedict XIII and communicated, almost unofficially, to the Melkites in the synod held on April 25, 1730. From this time onwards, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church has existed separately from and in parallel to the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch in the Middle East. The pallium, formal recognition of the patriarchal authority, was granted by Rome to Cyril only on February 3, 1744, about twenty years after the 1724 election.
The reasons for this caution and delay by Rome to recognize Cyril as patriarch can be summarized as follows:
Cyril VI Tanas summoned synods in 1736, 1751 and 1756 in order to give a structure to the Melkite Church, but without a full success. He died on January 10, 1760, leaving a complicated succession.

Road to Germany

"Road to Germany" is the third episode of the seventh season of "Family Guy". It originally aired on October 19, 2008, on Fox. It is Brian and Stewie's fourth road adventure, following "Road to Rhode Island", "Road to Europe", "Road to Rupert", and is succeeded by "Road to the Multiverse". The episode was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Greg Colton. The episode received favorable reviews from critics. The episode's guest stars include Brian Blessed, Gregory Jbara, Martin Savage, Jeff Witzke and Robert Boomfield. Mort accidentally goes into Stewie's time machine and is sent to September 1, 1939. Brian and Stewie realize Mort has gone back in time, and go in the time machine to save him.
Plot.
While the neighbors are watching the Oscars at the Griffins' house, Mort needs to use the bathroom so desperately that he runs into what he thinks is a portable toilet in Stewie's room. The "toilet" turns out to be a time machine, and Mort is sent to the past. Realizing that Mort does not have a return pad that would be able to bring him back to the present, Stewie and Brian take one of the return pads and go back in time to save Mort. They end up in Warsaw, Poland and find Mort in a synagogue. He believes he is in Heaven as he sees dead family members there. It does not take long for them to realize that the date is September 1, 1939, the day of the Nazi invasion of Poland and when World War II started.
The three cannot return to the present right away since the return pad breaks, so they decide to go to England where they will be safe to fix it. They are chased by the Nazis, forcing them to make a getaway on a motorbike, followed by an elaborate undersea pursuit in a hijacked U-boat. The three make it to England safely, and see Churchill. Stewie finds that the return pad is out of uranium fuel, and Brian states that the only place they can find more uranium in this time is at a "secret" nuclear testing facility in Berlin, Nazi Germany. The three join the Royal Air Force and fly a Lancaster bomber as they participate in a dogfight against a squadron of Luftwaffe Me-109 fighters, eventually reaching Berlin. After finding a research lab, Stewie disguises himself as Hitler, while the other two disguise themselves as Nazi Officers, and obtains the needed uranium. They then run into the real Hitler, who orders their execution, but they escape on the return pad back to their time (Hitler offered to spare them if they performed a charming musical number, but Mort cuts the eager Stewie and Brian off at the first line).
The group arrives back in Stewie's room 30 seconds before Mort originally entered the time machine. To keep these events from repeating themselves, Stewie kills the Mort that traveled with them by shoving him into the time machine and then blowing it up. The original Mort then enters the room and, now lacking the time machine "toilet" and seeing Stewie and Brian in Nazi uniform, soils himself instead.
Production.
"Road to Germany" is the third episode of "Family Guy"´s seventh season. It was written by Patrick Meighan who had written "Road to Rupert" The episode was directed by series regular Greg Colton, who had worked on "Brian Goes Back to College", "No Meals on Wheels" and also "8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter". Peter Shin and James Purdun acted as supervising directors. John Viener worked as an executive story editor. Seth MacFarlane, Chris Sheridan, David A. Goodman and Danny Smith were executive producers. Alec Sulkin, Wellesley Wild and Mike Henry acted as supervising producers. Richard Appel, Brian Scully, Mark Hentemann and Steve Callaghan worked as co-executive producers. After reading the script aloud, Jewish executive producer David A. Goodman said, "I'm going to get kicked out of my temple".
"Road to Germany" is the fourth episode of the "Road to" hallmarks of the series, which have aired in various seasons of the show, and the first to be directed by Colton. The episodes are a parody of the seven "Road to..." comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. The director who directed every previous Road to episodes Dan Povenmire left "Family Guy" soon after, following the conclusion of the fifth season, to create his own series, entitled "Phineas and Ferb", which has since been nominated for seven Emmy Awards.
"Road to Germany", along with the first eight episodes of the seventh season were released on DVD by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on June 16, 2009, one month after it had completed broadcast on television. The "Volume 7" DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, animatics, and commentaries for every episode.
Cultural references.
The episode begins with a swing band version of the orchestral theme from the 1980s miniseries "The Winds of War" and "War and Remembrance". When Brian, Stewie, and Mort are chased by Nazis, a recreation of the chase scene, including music, from "Back to the Future" occurs where Stewie rides a makeshift skateboard, escapes and has the Nazis crash into a truck of manure. Also, the entrance into Warsaw mirrors Marty's arrival in 1955 Hill Valley. When Stewie picks up a Nazi uniform there is a McCain-Palin button attached. Stewie and Hitler re-enact the famous "mirror" scene from the Marx Brothers film "Duck Soup". The U-Boat sequence is an adaptation of U-571 when Stewie decides to throw trash outside of the submarine in order to stop the U-Boat that was chasing them. Furthermore, the U-boat crashing scene is a reference to the multiple police car chases (and subsequential crashes) from The Blues Brothers. The scene where the Hawk Men defeat the Nazi air force is a parody of the film "Flash Gordon", with its original soundtrack by Queen. Stewie, Brian and Mort's escape from their crashing plane is a recreation of the raft scene from "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom". The Hebrew wedding scene plays a song titled "Through Poland to a Jewish Village". The scene in the uranium lab where the scientist shows Stewie "one hundred luftballons" followed by one popping is a reference to the song 99 Luftballons where 99 red balloons trigger a nuclear war.
Reception.
Reception of the episode was favorable. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode 9.6 saying, "Featuring gorgeous CGI animation, a genuinely exciting storyline, and some hilariously offensive humor, this Stewie and Brian centric episode of Family Guy easily stands out as one of the best episodes of the show in years." Alex Rocha of "TV Guide" was much more critical stating, "it seemed that the show has taken a slight fall back. After having great episodes the past few weeks to get this current season started on a roll, we have witnessed another average, even sub-par episode." In his review of "Family Guy", volume 7, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the episode "hugely memorable", and stated that it "features some of the finest animation the series has ever produced".
According to Seth MacFarlane, "Road to Germany" was one of three episodes (Along with "I Dream of Jesus" and "Family Gay") submitted for consideration for "Outstanding Comedy Series" in the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009. "We picked three of our edgier shows as a choice," he explained, "Ya know, we figured if we are going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are." The series was ultimately nominated for the award, the first time in 48 years an animated series was nominated for the same category.

The HA was a two-seat biplane with a central float and balancing floats on the wingtips. The fuselage was wood with a fabric covering. The plane was powered by a Liberty 12 engine in the nose. The prototype was ordered in December 1917, and its first flight was on 21 March 1918. During testing the aircraft proved very unstable, with an overly heavy tailplane. The aircraft was destroyed in a crash.
Two more prototypes were ordered, designated HA-1 and HA-2. the HA-1 was constructed of salvaged parts from the original, but its tailplane and radiator were redesigned, and its wings were moved further aft. The HA-1 caught fire during a flight. The HA-2 had a wider wingspan, and performed better, but as the war was almost over, no production order was received.
Operational history.
Three landplane versions were used as Mail planes.

Until the 18th century, it was the only church in Wolverhampton and the control of the college extended far into the surrounding area, with dependent chapels in several towns and villages of southern Staffordshire.
Fully integrated into the diocesan structure since 1848, today St Peter's is part of the Anglican Parish of Central Wolverhampton. The Grade I listed building, much of which is Perpendicular in style, dating from the 15th century, is of significant architectural and historical interest. Although it is not a cathedral, it has a strong choral foundation in keeping with English Cathedral tradition. The Father Willis organ is of particular note: a campaign to raise £270,000 for its restoration was launched in 2008.
History.
St Peter's is an Anglo-Saxon foundation. The history of St Peter's was dominated for centuries by its collegiate status, from the 12th century constituted as a dean and prebendaries, and by its royal connections, which were crystallised in the form of the Royal Peculiar in 1480. Although a source of pride and prosperity to both town and church, this institutional framework, hard-won and doggedly-defended, made the church subject to the whims of the monarch or governing elite and unresponsive to the needs of its people. Characterised by absenteeism and corruption through most of its history, the college was involved in constant political and legal strife, and it was dissolved and restored a total of three times, before a fourth and final dissolution in 1846 cleared the way for St Peter's to become an active urban parish church and a focus of civic pride.
994–1066: Origins and endowments.
There is some doubt abut the origins of the College of Wolverhampton. A charter was discovered around 1560, by which Sigeric, Archbishop of Canterbury, confirms Lady Wulfrun's endowment of a Minster at Hampton in the year 994-5. The authenticity of the charter is in some doubt, as it was allegedly discovered in the ruins of a wall at Lichfield and has since been lost. An alternative explanation is that the 7th century King Wulfhere of Mercia was involved in the founding of the town, the church, or both. The only real evidence for this is his name, preserved in the not far-distant settlement of Wolverley, which seems superficially similar. However, older forms of the town's name run against this hypothesis. Shortly after the Norman Conquest we find the College referred to as "the church of Wolvrenehamptonia". This certainly suggests that the eponym was Wulfrun rather than Wulfhere, although this does not guarantee that she was the founder: the settlement could date back to some earlier time. The name almost certainly means the "High Town" or "Chief Settlement" of Wulfrun.
Wulfrun apparently granted the College lands in or around Upper Arley, "Eswich" (probably Ashwood, Staffordshire, which was "Haswic" in Domesday), Bilston, Willenhall, Pelsall, Ogley Hay, Hatherton (near Cannock), Kinvaston (near Penkridge) Featherstone, and two villages called Hilton—one near Ogley and the other by Featherstone. There were also lands at Wolverhampton itself, probably those which Wulfrun herself had received from Ethelred II by a charter of 985. The Arley lands probably came from a grant which King Edgar the Peaceful had made to Wulfgeat, a relative of Wulfrun, in 963. In fact, before, the discovery of Wulfrun's charter, Edgar was generally accepted as the founder of the College.
The church was originally dedicated to St Mary and this was still the dedication at the Domesday survey of 1086: it was switched to St Peter in the mid-12th century. It seems likely that the College always consisted of secular clergy —priests who did not belong to a religious order, rather than monks. A writ attributed to King Edward the Confessor (1042–1066) refers to the College as "my priests at Hampton". Although the document is known to be a forgery, probably dating from a century later, the secular character of the College seems to have been accepted unchallenged, despite the implication in the foundation charter that it was a monastery. All of the Domesday entries relating to the church of Wolverhampton refer to clergy, canons or priests, never monks. There is no evidence that a monastery ever existed at Wolverhampton. If there was, it seems odd that Wulfrun would replace it with a secular chapter.
A college was not originally an educational institution but rather a body of people with a shared purpose, in this case a community of priests charged with pastoral care over a wide and wild area. Colleges of priests were not unusual in the Middle Ages, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon period, although they persisted long after. At a time of scattered population, poor communications and frequent lawlessness, it made sense to organise local ministry in teams that could offer mutual support and collective management of resources. From their central base, they could tour the surrounding hamlets, celebrating the Eucharist, preaching and teaching. In most cases, such settlements would not initially have a church building at all, but at most a cross to mark the place of worship. The later parish system organised under diocesan bishops only became truly viable as a landscape of peaceful villages emerged in the later Middle Ages.
1066-1200: The struggle for autonomy.
It is not clear when the College began to have a close connection with the Crown, although this was to become a defining characteristic, which shaped much of its history. The forged letter of Edward the Confessor is meant to point to just such a close relationship, but we know it dates from a century later, after the church had Wolverhampton had passed through a series of difficulties which it probably wanted to resolve permanently.
At the Norman Conquest, Wolverhampton's church was given by William the Conqueror to his own personal chaplain, Samson. Domesday shows that the canons of the College now held some of the property donated by Wulfrun as tenants of Samson. The estates at Kinvaston, Hatherton, Featherstone and nearby Hilton were rented out by Samson to other priests, Edwin and Alric. The canons also held land at Lutley, Worcestershire, and claimed woodland at Sedgeley, neither of which was in Wulfrun's grant. At Arley, some of their land had been seized forcibly by one Osbern, while Bilston now belonged to the Crown. At Wolverhampton, the canons' land was cultivated by 14 slaves, alongside 36 other peasants. The church also had slaves at Upper Arley. The expansion of the royal forests, hunting grounds for the king and his retainers, had hit the region hard and Wolverhampton was almost surrounded, with the Forest of Kinver up to its southern edge, and the Forest of Brewood and Cannock Chase to the north. This took substantial areas out of agricultural production, making them almost valueless to the College: there were five hides at Ashwood now subsumed into the Forest of Kinver, for example. Despite the direct royal patronage and the close attention of the royal chaplain, the Conquest had brought difficult times for the canons.
Samson was elected Bishop of Worcester in 1096. Presumably he had been in only minor orders, as he had to be ordained first deacon and then priest on a single day, before being consecrated as bishop the following day. He became notorious, despite his vow of clerical celibacy, as the father of at least three children, two of who later became bishops. During the reign of Henry I, he donated the church at Wolverhampton to his cathedral priory at Worcester, although its lands and privileges were protected.
However, The Anarchy, the confused civil strife of King Stephen's reign, brought great challenges. First the church was seized by Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, who was Lord Chancellor, the kingdom's senior bureaucrat. Roger had vowed loyalty to the Empress Matilda, Henry I's daughter and chosen heir, but immediately broke his word on Henry's death. His support was crucial in allowing Stephen to consolidate his rule after his coup d'état in 1135, and he used his influence to seize as much property as he was able, constructing vast castles and building a powerful ruling clique that included his nephews, Nigel, Bishop of Ely and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln. Stephen felt threatened by his over-mighty Chancellor and moved against him in 1139, seizing all his estates, including the church at Wolverhampton and its lands. Stephen promised initially to restore the Wolverhampton church to its rightful owners, but then he handed it over to the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, whose bishop, Roger de Clinton, was an important military leader in Stephen's cause and had just returned from a mission to explain Stephen's case to the Holy See. The canons were outraged at this betrayal of trust, which left them at the mercy of a powerful magnate in their own vicinity, and appealed to Pope Eugenius III. This campaign is the likely context for the creation of much of the facsimile or forged material that provided the church with a foundation narrative. It is also notable that the dedication was changed to St Peter around this time, and this too would be a flattering move in negotiations with Rome. Sometimes documents attest a dedication to St Peter and St Paul - a still more fulsome manoeuvre. Whatever dedication is given, the church's seals generally picture both saints.
The church's lobbying seems to have been very successful. Clinton died in 1148 and Wolverhampton was restored to the monks of Worcester before 1152. Stephen had by this time been forced to agree that he would be succeeded by Matilda's son, Henry Plantagenet, at that time already Duke of Normandy and Duke of Aquitaine. Even before he succeeded to the throne, Henry issued a charter in which he described the church at Wolverhampton as "my chapel", restored all its privileges from the time of Henry I, and recognised it as free from secular taxation. As soon as he came to the throne in 1154 as Henry II, he issued another charter recognising the right of the canons to hold a manorial court. Neither of these charters explicitly stated Wolverhampton was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Lichfield. However, Peter of Blois, probably appointed to head the College by Henry II shortly before his death in 1189, said that the church was subject only to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the King. Clearly, in Henry II's reign, the College already had an independence not enjoyed by most other institutions of the same kind.
1200–1224: Dissolution and restoration.
By the time Peter of Blois was appointed, the College was organised as a community of prebendaries, headed by a dean. This structure was probably imposed during the period of control by Lichfield, as this was the system established at Lichfield cathedral itself around 1140. Each prebendary drew his income from a prebend, a collection of lands and rights attached to tenure of a choir stall, and which determined where he would have pastoral and liturgical duties.
Peter was a poet and a diplomat of great experience. He had been tutor to William II of Sicily, one of the most cultivated rulers of his time, and he was himself a man of refinement and vision. He considered the prebendaries hopelessly corrupt, desperate to keep their positions, wealth and power within a tight grouping of families, held together by intermarriage. After more than a decade of struggle to reform the College, he resigned his post and put forward a revolutionary plan from outside.
Peter persuaded Archbishop Hubert Walter that it was necessary to dissolve the College completely and to replace it with an Abbey of Cistercian monks, an ascetic French order dedicated to a radical and literal interpretation of the Benedictine Rule. The plan was approved by both King John and Pope Innocent III, a reforming pontiff. John gave his formal consent for the new abbey in January 1203, although it appears that he had already appointed one Nicholas to the deanery. John handed over the prebends and deanery of Wolverhampton to the archbishop in order to support the abbey. Over the next two years, John also granted it the manors of Wolverhampton and Tettenhall, gave it the wood of Kingsley in the Forest of Kinver, and granted it a charter of liberties. The archbishop put the plan to the General Chapter of the Cistercian Order and brought some Cistercian monks to Wolverhampton in readiness.
Just as all these preparations were about to bear fruit, Hubert Walter died. Without him, the entire scheme collapsed. Within a month, John had changed his mind completely and appointed a replacement dean of Wolverhampton: Henry, son of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, his Chief Justiciar. Even before he was chosen, the first phase of a new church building had been started. The most logical starting point, given a clean slate, was the tower crossing: it remains to this day, the sole relic of the 13th-century building, and a reminder of the near-dissolution of the church. Henry Fitz Geoffrey, well-connected to all the centres of power in the kingdom, held the post of dean for nearly two decades, blocking reform or abolition.
1224-1300: Disputes and prosperity.
Giles of Erdington, who became Dean of St Peter's around 1224, was a talented lawyer and was already set on a career that would make him one of Henry III's most eminent judges, a Justice of the Common Bench. Erdington was to remain dean for 45 years and he placed all his skill at the service of the college. On appointment, he seized the opportunity afforded by the appointment of a new and inexperienced bishop, Alexander Stavensby, to make a formal deal with the Diocese of Lichfield. The dean's right to appoint and discipline his prebends was recognised. The bishop was to intervene only if there was evidence the dean was not carrying out these functions. For his part, the dean recognised the bishop's right to be received with honour at St Peter's and to administer the sacraments there. In 1260 Erdington repelled an attempt by Bishop Roger de Meyland to hold a visitation, in contravention of the agreement with the diocese, by appealing directly to the king and getting a royal prohibition.
Erdington was equally vigorous in promoting the economic interests of the college. Throughout, Erdington was concerned that the church benefit from the town's booming trade, which was based mainly on wool, promoting general growth rather than exacting every penny. To make clear the college's territorial sway, he had the boundaries walked ceremonially. In 1258 he secured from Henry III the lucrative right to hold a weekly market and an annual fair, both of which took place thereafter at the foot of the church steps. In 1263 he won the support of the town's burgesses by granting them the right to succeed to their burgages without fee. The town is sometimes described as a "deanery borough". A borough had no fixed legal status before the 19th century municipal reforms, but was generally understood to be a town with a community of free townspeople and civic institutions. The college was now recognised as the collective lord of the manor, and through the dean recognised the effective autonomy of the civic community, explicitly placing the burgesses on an equal footing with the county town of Stafford
The next dean, Theodosius de Camilla, appointed in 1269, was just as vigorous as Erdington in defending the college, but his tenure began to demonstrate some of the disadvantages of royal appointment. He was prepared to defend the college even against the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Second Council of Lyons in 1274 denounced a number of abuses of which the prebendaries were plainly guilty, including non-residence and pluralism. In fact Camilla himself was non-resident, as he was mostly involved in royal business, and it is not even certain that he ever visited Wolverhampton: he operated mainly through bailiffs, who carried out his instructions and transactions. At least three of the canons were Camilla's relatives, and they seldom seldom appeared in the town either. Archbishop John Peckham was determined to bring the royal chapels to book. On 27 July 1280 the archbishop, against an explicit prohibition of Edward I, appeared at the doors of St Peter's, which were promptly shut in his face. He summoned the prebendaries to meet him on 31 July but they, together with the canons of all seven royal chapels, ignored him and were excommunicated. Proceedings were launched against the seven chapels in the ecclesiastical courts. This forced the king to act, and he swiftly brought the archbishop to heel, pressuring him to agree that he would accept a royal decision on the chapels within the Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, and also in London. Bishop Meyland too was induced to agree never to visit six of the chapels, including Wolverhampton.
The archbishop's feud with Camilla continued, however. In 1282 Camilla was excommunicated and deprived of two other churches that he held. Peckham even claimed that Wolverhampton was not rightly his, as Canterbury had the patronage. However, he obtained monetary compensation for his two lost churches in 1286. He also pursued the local dispute with the diocese until 1292, when Bishop Meyland finally recognised that all seven royal chapels within its bounds were subject only to the Pope. Camilla developed the lands of the college by encouraging the tenants to enclose wastes, although he also encouraged his bailiffs to over-exploit woodlands. When he died in 1295, he was still Dean of Wolverhampton, despite all opposition.
Erdington and Camilla brought St Peter's to its medieval peak of prosperity and influence, although its spiritual standards were already notorious. The economic well-being of the church was greatly improved by their unwillingness to pay tax. Camilla was deriving 50 marks a year from the deanery by the 1290s, but declared only 20 marks for tax purposes. The total taxable value of the church was declared in 1293 as only £54 13s. 4d. This included six prebends, which are named for the first time at this point: Featherstone, Willenhall, Wobaston, Hilton, Monmore, Kinvaston. In addition there was the chantry of St. Mary in Hatherton, which was shortly to become a seventh prebend. Deans and canons alike increasingly gained an income from their estates not through their own management, but by farming, which in this period meant leasing the right to receive rents and dues to someone else, who then made a profit by exploiting them to the fullest possible extent.
1300-1479: Neglect and revival.
While the 13th century deans had been shrewd business men on behalf of the church, the 14th century deans stripped its assets, and in some cases resorted to plain embezzlement. One of the most important problems was that they began to enclose waste for themselves and then to sell it off, alienating it from the church's estates. John of Everdon (1295–1303), Philip of Everdon (1303–23) and Hugh Ellis (1328–39) all pursued personal enrichment in this way. Hugh also gave away much of the stock of the deanery and left the buildings dilapidated. By 1368, things had reached such a pass that Edward III himself ordered a visitation of Wolverhampton to investigate loss of property and privileges, fraud, loss of books and ornaments, neglect of services and misconduct by the canons. In fact, Wolverhampton's deans had remained zealous in maintaining the college's rights and privileges, getting successive kings to confirm its charters, but most of the other accusations were true.
The king's enquiry had no effect. Dean Richard Postell (1373–94) embezzled an income set aside for six priests to celebrate the liturgy—something the dean and prebendaries themselves no longer did. Lawrence Allerthorpe (1394–1406) and Thomas Stanley (1406–10) continued to neglect the deanery and enquiries followed both their deaths. In addition, the townspeople complained about the neglect of spiritual duties under both Postell and Allerthorpe. Enquiries generally found that the dean and all the prebendaries were absentees. The prebendaries actually employed vicars to perform their duties for them. This was the age of the Black Death, which brought about a spiritual crisis that the church was ill-equipped to confront. Despite this neglect, there were still plenty of pious people prepared to make large donations and bequests to the church. There were two chantry chapels in the collegiate church, both well-endowed. A special body, the "wardens of the light", was founded in 1385 to tend a light in honour of St Peter. Priests were maintained at Pelsall, Willenhall and Bilston from special, earmarked endowments left by parishioners.
A remarkable product of this piety was St Mary's Hospital—not a centre for medical treatment but an almshouse. It was established through the efforts of William Waterfall, a generous layman, and Clement Leveson, a chaplain at St. Peter's, during the years 1392-95. First they obtained a royal licence for the hospital, then Waterfall endowed it with three acres of land and obtained the lord of the manor's permission. The land was only 400 metres south east of St. Peter's but it fell outside the manor of Wolverhampton, in the manor of Stowheath, which was held by Hugh, Lord Burnell, a powerful marcher lord. Finally they obtained Dean Allerthorpe's permission, as the land fell within the jurisdiction of the college. Patronage went to William and Joan Waterfall and their heirs, but was to pass to the Leveson family if they lapsed. The regulations bound the chaplain to say mass and vespers daily for the residents, and prayers were to be offered for the souls of Clement Leveson, William and Joan Waterfall, Lord Burnell, and Lawrence Allerthorpe. The first recorded chaplain was John Pepard, inducted in 1402. Presumably this is why the institution came to be known as "Pepers Chapell" and later "Pyper's Chapel": Piper's Row is still a well-known street name, now the site of the City's bus station.
Amid this clerical neglect and lay piety, some of the college's ancient privileges were again challenged. In 1401 Allerthorpe had just been appointed Lord High Treasurer by Henry IV, newly established on the throne after overthrowing Richard II of England. It was at this point that Archbishop Thomas Arundel, a key supporter of the king, sent delegates to carry out a visitation of St. Peter's. Allerthorpe objected but had to back down, as there was little doubt whose support was most important to Henry.
However, the decline was stemmed by two vigorous deans, whose work in the town roughly spans the Wars of the Roses. John Barningham was appointed in 1437 and showed a genuine interest in the church, the town and its people. It was he who began the rebuilding of the church in approximately its present form. When he died in 1457, he left money not only for the rebuilding but also for the poor of the town. William Dudley, his successor, managed much of the rebuilding. He was also Dean of Windsor, the first Dean of Wolverhampton to hold both posts. He resigned in 1476 to become Bishop of Durham and was later a key supporter of Richard III. By simply spending some of their time on its affairs, after a century of neglect, these men were able partially to rebuild the college's relationship with the town.
After Dudley moved to Durham, Lionel Woodville, the Queen's brother was dean for a few years, but he resigned when he became Chancellor of the University of Oxford. In 1479, Richard Beauchamp, already Bishop of Salisbury and Dean of Windsor, was appointed.
1479–1603: Royal Peculiar and Reformation.
The year after Beauchamp's appointment, Edward IV resolved that, thereafter, the same person should be Dean of Windsor and Dean of Wolverhampton. It is from this point that Wolverhampton is generally considered a Royal Peculiar or Peculier. In fact, it had claimed and vindicated its status as a royal chapel, independent of the diocesan authorities, for many centuries already. From 1480, however, it was formally placed on a footing with St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, the monarch's own household chapel. It was never subsumed into Windsor. For about half a century, about half of the prebendaries were also canons of Windsor, but this practice petered out in the 16th century. The link between Wolverhampton and Windsor persisted purely through the dual role of the deans and Wolverhampton kept its own seal–a key indicator of institutional independence.
As the deans and most of the canons continued to be absentees, their lands and rights were increasingly farmed out. From 1516, it was James Leveson, one of the immensely rich and powerful Merchants of the Staple who increasingly took over responsibility for exploiting their estates. The rent agreed for the deanery holdings was £38, and Leveson managed to keep it fixed for 25 years, despite steady inflation. He also gradually extended his investments into the prebendary holdings. The Leveson family inherited and extended his interests after he died. (The name Leveson is pronounced and is a patronymic from Louis or Lewis)
The Reformation brought dissolution for the second time in the college's history. It was threatened under the first Chantry Act in 1545 but survived because Henry VIII died before it could be implemented. Edward VI's Protestant guardians brought in a second act in 1547. The Dean argued that Wolverhampton should be exempt, as Windsor was specifically excluded from the terms of the act. Nevertheless, the college was dissolved and replaced by a vicar and curates, on £20 a year. This was not a great hardship for the dean and canons, as they continued to receive pensions at the same level as their former income from their benefices. Moreover, the canons had farmed out most of their holdings on perpetual leases, at fixed and very low rents, to the Leveson and Brooke families—allegedly in the hope of recovering them later and protecting the college's investments, but probably to make a quick gain before dissolution. The sale was authorised by the chapter of Windsor, which was not lawful, as the two colleges had separate seals and finances. The prebendary and the deanery estates themselves were confiscated by the Crown, then granted to John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, the leading figure of Edward's later, and more radically Protestant, government.
However, Queen Mary's Counter-Reformation soon restored the old regime. As Northumberland was attainted, his property was forfeit, so it was relatively easy to restore the college's property. This was presented by Mary's letters patent as a favour to St. George's College, Windsor. However, Mary's gracious act left the years 1547–53 in legal limbo, with the status of any transactions carried out by the canons during those years uncertain. St. Peter's was the only royal peculiar in the region to be restored: all the others proved intractable, as the property had been sold or given to landowners in good standing, many of them pious Catholics. The little hospital of St. Mary was not so fortunate. The provision to say prayers for the dead would have guaranteed its dissolution as a chantry and it is never heard of again, apparently absorbed into the Leveson estates.
Despite a decision to follow a broadly Protestant path, Elizabeth did not pursue the matter further, and confirmed the restoration of the college by royal charter in 1564. This meant a restoration of the old abuses. The deans and most of the canons stayed away, failing to attend even the quarterly chapter meetings and paying scant wages to deacons, and in some cases unordained readers, to perform their functions at St. Peter's. The running of Wolverhampton's church devolved upon the sacrist, who was paid a separate income, amounting to the reasonable sum of £26 by the mid-17th century, and given a seat on the chapter. In the satellite chapels at Bilston, Pelsall and Willenhall, curates were paid £4 or £5 a year to maintain an active ministry. A Puritan survey carried out in 1604 found that all three curates then in office were drunkards and non-preachers.
1603–1660: Religious strife and civil war.
For Puritans, who wanted to renew and broaden the Reformation, the running of St. Peter's was one of the most notorious scandals in the Church of England. Locally, the initiative was taken by Richard Lee, who was appointed to the prebend of Willenhall in 1622 by a sympathetic dean, and who denounced what he saw as the sins of his time. The temper of the town was mainly Puritan and anti-royalist, so Lee seems to have met a warm response. However, Matthew Wren, appointed Dean in 1628 was a supporter of William Laud, leader of the High Church party that came into the ascendancy with the accession of Charles I. He particularly objected to the fact that Lee had taken up residence in Wolverhampton and preached regularly. Wren became a bishop in 1634 and was succeeded by Christopher Wren, his brother and the father of the famous architect. This Wren immediately realised that Lee was beyond his control and took panic measures to deal with him. Surrendering a privilege that had survived since 1280, he called in Archbishop Laud himself to conduct a visitation. Lee was suspended and a purge of Puritan parishioners was launched. Wren celebrated with an elaborate ceremony to consecrate a new High Altar in the church, with incense and music, all calculated to offend the Puritans.
This short-lived triumph for the Laudians came at a price. When the Long Parliament assembled in 1640, Laud's arrest was one of its first acts. In 1644, during the English Civil war, he was brought to trial for treason and the events at Wolverhampton were high on the list of accusations brought against him. Evidence against him was given by two Wolverhampton men, Leonard Lee, Richard's brother, and William Pinson. Although the trial itself was inconclusive, Laud was attainted and beheaded a few months later.
St. Peter's church itself suffered considerable damage at the hands of Parliamentary soldiers in 1642. Much worse was an attack on the chapter house by royalist soldiers under Colonel Leveson, which resulted in the loss of all its records. A law of 1643 suppressed all deans and chapters and, after the fighting drew to a close in 1646, the college was dissolved, for the third time in its history. Its assets were vested in trustees, and they provided £100 for a minister - none other than the apparently stainless Richard Lee. However, Lee appears to have taken on two other parishes - Melbourne and Rugby - and was in no great hurry to quit either. The post of sacrist was abolished and his £26, together with a further £50, was provided for an assistant minister. This allowed the trustees to raise the incomes of the other ministers to viable levels too. The minister at Shareshill was granted £100 and the minister at Wednesfield £50. However, this all happened in the absence of the Levesons, who had claims on six of the prebends since the reign of Edward VI, but whose property was sequestrated. Once the sequestrations were discharged in 1652, the Levesons reclaimed their lands at the former low, fixed rents, and the trustees' careful financial management fell apart.
The Restoration of Charles II automatically brought the restoration of the college at St. Peter's, as the legislation abolishing it was regarded as invalid. Everything was restored very quickly. However, the loss of the records at the hands of Leveson, whose family coincidentally had important claims on college property, was a serious problem for the restored institution.
1660-1848: Decline and demise of the old order.
The college was hampered financially from its restoration. It challenged the Levesons legally but the Court of Chancery dismissed the case in 1667 and awarded Robert Leveson costs. Leveson sold his Wolverhampton estates to the Earl of Bradford, his nephew, in 1705 and the college went to court again to recover its alienated lands. This time the case was dismissed immediately. Not until 1811 did the college finally abandon its attempts to recover its property - more than two and a half centuries after its loss.
All the dependent chapels but Kinvaston were now very poorly funded and unable to attract able or dedicated ministers. They were still expected to contribute to the upkeep of St. Peter's and to the expenses of the sacrist, who doggedly defended his income from burials and other rites. They were now starting to chafe at the bit. Bilston revolted against the dean's attempts to impose a curate twice—in 1730 and 1735—and the congregation elected their own.
The population of Wolverhampton itself and of the towns to the east was growing rapidly as manufacturing took hold. Peniston Booth, a dean who actually spent some of his time at the deanery house in Wolverhampton, was sufficiently in touch with opinion to authorise the building of new chapels of ease at Wednesfield, Willenhall and Bilston. With considerably more persuasion, and after a major public campaign fronted by Lord Grey, he acquiesced in the building of a new chapel of ease in Wolverhampton itself. It was authorised by a private Act of Parliament in 1755, and the fine Neo-Classical St John's Church, Wolverhampton quickly rose on a site enclosed in a square to the south of St. Peter's.
The college, with its deanery and prebends, was increasingly proving a straitjacket for the Anglican Church in Wolverhampton. The increasing population was a challenge in itself, but it also brought social misery and discontent as the crowded housing of the Wolverhampton and the Black Country failed to keep up with demand. Increasing religious diversity was another consequence. There had been Protestant Dissenters since the Civil War, but their numbers were greatly increased by the preaching of Methodism: in 1761 John Wesley himself preached at an inn-yard in what he called "this furious town" of Wolverhampton. Catholic recusancy was strong in the surrounding countryside. Despite the Penal laws, in the 1730s the Giffard family of Brewood succeeded in building a Catholic chapel in the guise of a private house, just to the west of St. Peter's. As Catholic Emancipation approached, this was rapidly expanded into a functioning Roman Catholic church. Already, distress in Ireland was bringing immigration and a large working class, Irish Catholic community, concentrated to the north of St. Peter's in the slums of an area known as "Caribee Island".
In 1811 a special Act was passed to reform St. Peter's church itself. The post of sacrist was replaced by that of perpetual curate. Three readerships were abolished and their income signed over to the curate. A fund was established from proceeds of mining on the deanery land to improve the income of the curate. This did not go far enough. The curate was still heavily dependent on fees from the dependent chapels and friction over this continued to sour relations. However, the curates initially performed their duties very much better than earlier sacrists and things were improved further by the building of a new chapel of ease in the town: St. George's, another Neo-Classical structure, completed in 1830 to a design by James Morgan.
It was in connection with a possible post at St. George's that William Dalton, an Evangelical Anglican clergyman from Ulster first visited Wolverhampton. He returned in 1835, after marrying Sarah Marsh, the widow of a Bilston ironmaster, to take up the living of St. Paul's, yet another chapel of ease on the south-western edge of the town. Dalton began a lifelong campaign to build more churches to serve the growing population. Dalton's agitation had a venomously anti-Catholic edge, attacking both Anglo-Catholicism and Roman Catholicism, but his church-building campaign won wide support. It further undermined the relevance of the dean and the Royal Peculiar. St. Peter's itself and all the new chapels already operated as parish churches in all but name, but were hampered by lack of funds. The deanery was a sinecure that took £600 a year out of the town - largely the product of coal mining on deanery lands.
The radical Whig administration of the 1830s was determined to remedy a wide range of abuses at the local level. The establishment of elected municipal self-government for Wolverhampton and most of England's towns and cities came in 1836. This swept away the last vestiges of ecclesiastical influence in the politics of Wolverhampton and created a much stronger expectation of local accountability. In the same year, the Ecclesiastical Commissioner was established, aimed at rationalising the finances and structures of the Church of England, and charged with recommending further legislation to reform the Church. Henry Lewis Hobart, the Dean of Windsor and Wolverhampton, was generally considered a wealthy nonentity and had failed to win any real support at Court. The perpetual curate, Dr. George Oliver, appointed in 1834, was a quarrelsome man who had alienated all the local clergy, mainly in disputes over burial fees. The Cathedrals Act of 1840 decreed that the deanery should be suppressed on the death of Dean Hobart. The prebends were left vacant in readiness and, on Hobart's death in 1846, the deanery was wound up. In 1847, Dr. Oliver resigned and the post of perpetual curate was suspended, with John Dakeyne appointed sacrist, pending a full reorganisation. In 1848, a specific piece of legislation for St. Peter's, the Wolverhampton Church Act, abolished the ancient college altogether and transferred all its assets to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They swiftly oversaw the establishment of a rectory for St. Peter's and confirmed Dakeyne as rector. All the dependent chapels were turned into separate parish churches, each with its own vicar. From the available funds, the Commissioners were able to grant the rector a living of £750 a year, and to improve the incomes of all 13 of the other clergy involved, as well as to contribute to building repairs. St. Peter's and all the newly established parishes became part of the Diocese of Lichfield, subject to the bishop as Ordinary.
Architecture.
St Peter's Church is built of red sandstone on an elevated site in the centre of the City of Wolverhampton. The oldest part of the building above ground is the crossing under the tower, which probably dates from the beginnings of the Abbey in 1200, followed by the Chapel of Our Lady and St George (Lady Chapel). Much of the Church was rebuilt and extended in the fourteenth century, in the Decorated Style. However, the Church was to be substantially altered in the middle of the fifteenth century at the expense of the town's wool merchants, with the addition of a clerestory to the nave, and reduction in height of the north and south aisles. The upper part of the tower was rebuilt around 1475 to a height of 120 feet, and the Chapel of St Catherine and St Nicholas (Memorial Chapel) was completed at the end of the fifteenth century. The chancel was reconstructed in 1682 following considerable damage caused to the original medieval one during the Civil War, and it was again completely rebuilt in 1867 as part of the extensive restoration of the Church under architect Ewan Christian.
Unique features include the carved stone pulpit with a figure of a lion at the foot of the steps to protect the minister delivering the sermon. The font dates from 1480 with several stone carved figures and the west gallery dates from 1610, paid for by the Merchant Taylors' Company for use by the boys of Wolverhampton Grammar School.
Near the south porch is a 14 foot high stone column, carved in the ninth century with birds, animals and acanthus. It may have been a column pillaged from Roman Viroconium and brought to Heantune, either as part of a preaching cross or memorial. The carvings have deteriorated, but a cast made in 1877 can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
Bells.
The bells of St. Peter's are the second oldest complete ring of 12 in the country and third oldest in the world, all twelve cast in 1911 by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon.
Five bells are known to have existed at St. Peter's in 1553. In 1698 a new 23 cwt. ring of eight was cast by Abraham Rudhall I. In 1740 Henry Bagley III of Chacombe cast a large ‘funeral’ (or hour) bell of some 35 cwt. In 1827 the eight were augmented to ten by Thomas Mears. The ten ringing bells were rehung by Barwells in 1889 and the seventh was recast in 1895 by Mears & Stainbank after cracking during a peal attempt.
The bells, including the hour bell, were recast and two new trebles added to produce a new ring of twelve by Gillett & Johnston. This was their first complete ring of twelve, to be followed by Coventry in 1927, Croydon in 1936 and Halifax in 1952. They were tuned on the 5 tone Simpson Principle in the key of C sharp major. Gillett also provided a new single-tier steel and iron H-frame with new fittings throughout. The clock chime was connected to the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th and the clock generally rearranged. They were rung for the first time as 12 for the coronation of King George V after a silence of three years. The front eight were subsequently rehung in 1977 and the tenor in 1985.
In April 2000 maintenance work was carried out. The 9th, 10th and 11th were rehung on new bearings and the pulley on the 10th was renewed. The 12 ductile-iron clappers were replaced by the original, overhauled wrought-iron clappers and other minor works carried out. All work was carried out by Whitechapel Bell Foundry of London.
The bells are rung twice weekly, on Mondays for practice and for the main Sunday service.
Music.
The three-manual Father Willis organ, was built in 1860. A campaign to raise £300,000 towards its restoration was launched in 2008. The restoration work, designed to return the organ to its former glory after the wear and tear of near-daily use, is due to be completed by Principal Pipe Organs of York.
On Saturday 25 September 2010 a concert of Elgar's greatest pieces was held at the church which included the very first football chant, "He Banged The Leather for Goal", written by Elgar himself, in respect of Wolves star of the time, Billy Malpass. The concert was a joint venture between the church and Wolverhampton Wanderers to raise funds for the organ appeal and to firm the link that Elgar had between respective organisations. Elgar was a Wolves fan and cycled from Malvern (a good 40 miles approx)) to watch the Wolves with close friend Dora Penny, daughter of then St Peter's Church Rector Revd Penny. St Peter’s director of music Peter Morris said: “We wanted to celebrate the connection between Elgar and the church, so we got in touch with Wolves and it just grew.
“We knew about Elgar’s connection with the club because the rector’s daughter Dora Penny used to write about him going to watch them when he came to visit.”
There is a strong choral tradition: more than 70 children and young people are involved in the Music at St Peter's, along with Lay Clerks and choral scholars. There are separate boys' and girls' choirs, each of which generally sings at a Cathedral during the Summer holidays. The Boys' Choir, Lay Clerks and choral scholars sang at Lincoln Cathedral in 2007, York Minster in 2008, Norwich Cathedral in 2009, Rochester Cathedral in 2010, Ely Cathedral in 2011, Wells Cathedral in 2012 and Chichester Cathedral in 2013. The girls choir, Lay Clerks and choral scholars sang at Chester Cathedral in 2007, Chichester Cathedral in 2008 and 2010, Carlisle Cathedral in 2009, Canterbury Cathedral in 2011, Truro Cathedral in 2012 and Salisbury Cathedral in 2013.
The church is involved with the Choristers Outreach Programme of the Choir Schools Association and Sing Up which takes choristers into Primary Schools in the city to help the singing programmes in schools.
The Director of Music is Peter Morris and Assistant Organists are Matt Rose, Toby Barnard and Dr. David Rendell (Organist Emeritus) 
Today.
Worship is in the Catholic tradition of the Church of England. Vestments, reservation and the sacrament of reconciliation are all part of its tradition with incense used at festival services. Sunday services usually comprise Holy Communion, Choral Eucharist, and Choral Evensong. Choral Evensong is also sung on Wednesdays at 5.15pm.
St. Peter's is open on weekdays and Saturdays, and before and after services on Sundays. There is a shop within the church and a coffee lounge in the nearby St. Peter's House.
The church has links with St. Peter's Collegiate School, which, although originally founded adjacent to the church in 1847, is now located at Compton Park, along with St Edmund's Catholic Academy and part of the University of Wolverhampton.

D-74 122 mm Field Gun

The 122mm D-74 towed gun is a Soviet built gun. Developed in the late 1950s it provided direct/indirect fire for the Soviet Army. Today it is in reserve units with the Russian Army.
It is in active service with the Sri Lankan Army, the Egyptian Army and the Pakistani Army.
History.
122 mm (originally 48 lines) has been a Russian calibre since the early 20th century. After World War II the Soviet Union develop two new long range guns to replace existing 122 mm and 152 mm guns such as 122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19), 122 mm gun Model 1931, 152 mm gun Model 1910/30 and 152 mm gun Model 1935 (BR-2). The two new guns were 122 mm D-74 and 130 mm M-46. Both guns entered Soviet service but its heavier shell and greater range meant that M-46 outlasted D-74.
The D-74 design was probably initiated in the late 1940s and it was first seen in public in 1955. It was designed by the well established design bureau at Artillery Plant No 9 in Sverdlovsk (now Motovilikha Plants in Yekaterinburg) led by the eminent artillery designer Fëdor Fëdorovich Petrov (1902-1978) that was responsible for several World War II and later pieces. The design team also developed the 152 mm gun howitzer D-20 at much the same time, and both D-74 and D-20 use the same carriage.
Description.
D-74 has a 52 calibre barrel, with a double baffle muzzlebrake and a semi-automatic vertical sliding block breach, with a tied jaw and the block moving down to open. The barrel is mounted in a long ring cradle with the trunnions just forward of the breach. The recoil system (buffer and recuperator) is mounted on the cradle above the barrel. Compression balancing gear is attached behind the saddle support, passing through the complex shaped saddle to connect to the cradle just forward of the trunnions. This can be manually re-pressured by a pump below the breach. The breach has a projectile retaining catch to prevent the shell sliding out at higher elevations before it is rammed with a manual rammer.
Top traverse totals 60° and the vertical elevation range in -5° to 50°. 
Box girder section split trail legs are hinged to the cradle support, with bolts to lock them into either the open or closed position. The cradle support also has a bolt for locking the barrel in centre for traverse before towing the gun. There are small spades at the end of each trail leg, and fittings for large spades that are carried on the side of each trail leg. The large spades are used on soft ground and are fitted to the trail ends via have a pintle in the same way as the similar spades on M-46. These spades are the main difference from the D-20 carriage.
To assist with all-round carriage traverse, there is a pivot jack mounted at the front of the cradle support. The pivot jack is not a sole plate and the gun fires with its foam filled rubber tyred wheels supporting the gun on the ground. When the gun is brought into action the pivot jack is folded down and adjusted to be on the ground. If the requires large traverse, small jacks on each trail leg are rotated downwards, and the trails jacked up until the main wheels are lifted clear of the ground and the bogey wheels mounted on each trail leg swung downwards and the trail jacks raised, the carriage is then traversed, and the trail jacks re-used to lift the bogey wheels and then place the piece back on its main wheels. 
The pivot jack is also used to secure the barrel against vertical movement when the gun is being towed. The barrel is locked in centre for traverse with a bolt on the cradle support. The jack is folded upwards, lugs on the ring cradle engage the jack base and two tensioners fixed to the saddle support are hooked to the cradle, these are tightened to lock the cradle onto the jack base.
As was normal for the period the gun has a shield, including a folding piece below the cradle support. The centre section of the upper shield both slides up and down and folds to accommodate the barrel at higher elevation angles of fire. The shield may offer some protection against muzzle blast to the sights and layer, although it is usually shown being fired with a long lanyard, but is probably mostly for defence against machine gun fire. 
The non-reciprocating sights are designed for one-man laying. Included are a direct fire anti-tank telescope (OP4M), a panoramic periscopic indirect-fire sight, a dial sight, (PG1M), an angle of sight scale, and a range drum for the single charge engraved with the range (distance) scale, coupled to an elevation levelling bubble mounted on dial sight mount. The range drum enables the standard Soviet technique of semi-direct fire when the piece is laid visually on the target and the range set on the range drum. 
The gun fires separate ammunition using a metal cartridge case that also provides obturation. The ammunition is different to that used with 122 mm howitzers. There is a single charge without increments. The shell weight is 25 kg with a muzzle velocity of 900 m/s although the slightly lighter APHE shell has a higher muzzle velocity. 
Maximum rate of fire is usually stated as 6 rounds/minute. 
The detachment was either 8 or 9 men, probably differing between armies and period. In Soviet service the 5,600 kg gun was usually towed by a URAL-375 6×6 truck, AT-S or AT-L medium tractor in some regions.

St. Helen's Church, Grove

St. Helen's Church, Grove is a parish church in the Church of England in Grove, Nottinghamshire.
The church is Grade II listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as it is a building of special architectural or historic interest.
History.
The foundation is medieval but the current church is by C. Hodgson Fowler, dating from 1882.
The period when this church was founded is not exactly known, but in all probability it was anterior to the Norman Conquest, as in Domesday Book is observed, that here was a priest and a church, and of meadow; pasture wood one league long and half-a-one broad, of the yearly value of 40 shillings. Anciently it was a double rectory, and also a vicarage of medieties, but on the 3rd of the nones of May, 1227, Walter de Grey, Archbishop of York, consolidated them, when George de Ordsall, who was vicar of one mediety, was presented to the whole by Malvesinus de Hercy, (the first of that ancient family,) on condition that he should allow the rector 28s. per annum, for ever.
In 1425, Sir Thomas Hercy, Knight, bequeathed to the rector of this church, "in name of his principal", his best horse with his array, according to his estate. Humphrey Hercy, Esq. at his death, bequeathed "his soul to God, and his body to be buried in the Queare or Chancel of the Invention of the Crosse of Grove."
"The situation of this church is peculiarly pleasing and interesting; seated on an eminence, and surrounded by trees rendered venerable from their great age, it may with propriety be stiled a place where
"The traveller outworn with life's pilgrimage dreary,
Lays down his rude staff like one that is weary,
And sweetly reposes for ever."
Indeed, the whole scene is calculated to excite those finer feelings of the mind whilst ruminating over the scattered fragments of mortality; whilst they, unconscions of the visitors tread, sleep on in silence and obscurity. Here the ashes of some of the bravest and best of human kind commingle together, and although the destroyer—Time, has obliterated nearly all the visible signs which once mark’d the hallowed spot, he has not yet been enabled altogether to blast with his oblivious breath those records which bear testimony that they have once existed."
The church is small and ancient; it is dedicated to St. Helen, and consists of a nave and chancel; in its exterior it has nothing whereof to boast, its interior is simple, clean, and in good repair. The tower is squat and contains two bells.
Memorials.
Within the chancel are two or three curious antique monumental floor stones, on one of which is inscribed an ornamental cross, hut the rest is illegible. By the side of this is another to the memory of Hugo de Hercy, on which
"Outstretch’d together are exprest,
He and my Lady fair;
With hands uplifted on the breast,
In attitude of prayer."
This is an alabaster slab, six feet six inches long, and three feet three inches broad; one of the figures represents a man in armour, on his head a hat and feather, a greyhound at his feet looking up,—the face worn out: at his side a woman,—her face and head-dress very indistinct, on the left side of her head some appearance of a reticulated dress. The crack across the stone is so splintered that whatsoever has been at her feet is not now to be known. Above the man's head is a shield, but the colours are quite indistinct; above the woman's, the saltiere is engraved, with a round pell.— it appears black, being inlaid with pitch. Near the edge of the stone—
"Hic jacet Hugo Hercy qui obiit VI die Decembris anno dm m. cccc. I. V. et Elizabeth uxor ejus quae obiit anno dm m. cccc. I. Animae proprietur Deus."
In the aisle is another, having the following,—.
Resvrgam Katharine Neville obiit 17mo. die Mass 1683.
In the chancel is a neat mural monument as under,—
To the memory of WILLIAM LEVINZ, Esq. only son of Sir Creswell Levinz, Kt. Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, whose many virtues he inherited, having represented in Parliament for many years the Borough of East Retforel, and then this county, with uncommon abilities, diligence and integrity. He died May 7, 1747, aged 76 years. He married Anne daughter of Samuel Buck, Esq. barrister at law, a partner worthy of so much merit, who died June 15, 1726, in the 51st year of her age, and lieth here interred.
The living of Grove is a rectory, and when Mr. Hercy was paton, it was valued at £10; it is now £11. 14s. 2d. in the king's books, and pays for tenths, £1. 3s. 5d.; for first fruits, 6s. 5d.; and for synodals, 3s. Patron, Anthony Hardolph Eyre, Esq. Incumbent, Rev. Abraham Youle, M. A.
Parish structure.
The church is in a group of parishes which includes
Organ.
The church has a two manual pipe organ by Bevington dating from 1859. It was installed in St Helen's Church in 1894. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Bellanca Airfield

The Bellanca Airfield was an airfield, aircraft plant, and service hangar built in 1928 by Giuseppe Bellanca and Henry B. DuPont in New Castle, Delaware. Located off Route 273 near the Delaware River, the plant produced approximately 3000 aircraft before closing in 1954.
The only surviving part of the airfield is the former Air Service, Inc. hangar, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.
History.
Giuseppe Mario Bellanca immigrated from Italy in 1912 and continued his passion for aircraft design in the United States. His aircraft achieved numerous endurance and efficiency records. His $25,000 WB-2 monoplane, "Columbia", was the first choice of Charles Lindbergh for his trans-Atlantic flight after, on April 25, 1927, Clarence Chamberlin and Bert Acosta set the world endurance record for aircraft, staying aloft circling New York City for 51 hours, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds and covering 4,100 miles, more than the 3,600 mile from New York to Paris. "Time" magazine reported on April 25, 1927:
Engineer Giuseppe M. Bellanca of the Columbia Aircraft Corporation had conditioned an elderly yellow-winged monoplane with one Wright motor, and scouted around for pilots. Lieut. Leigh Wade, round-the-world flyer, declined the invitation, saying Mr. Bellanca's plans were too stunt-like, not scientific. Shrugging, Mr. Bellanca engaged Pilots Clarence Duncan Chamberlin and burly Bert Acosta, onetime auto speedster, to test his ship's endurance. Up they put from Mitchel Field, Long Island, with 385 gallons of ethylated (high power) gasoline. All day they droned back and forth over suburbia, circled the Woolworth Building, hovered over Hadley Field, New Jersey, swung back to drop notes on Mitchell Field. All that starry night they wandered slowly around the sky, and all the next day, and through the next night, a muggy, cloudy one. Newsgatherers flew up alongside to shout unintelligible things through megaphones. Messrs. Acosta and Chamberlain were looking tired and oil-blobbed. They swallowed soup and sandwiches, caught catnaps on the mattressed fuel tank, while on and on they droned, almost lazily (about 80 m.p.h.) for they were cruising against time. Not for 51 hours, 11 minutes, 25 seconds, did they coast to earth, having broken the U.S. and world's records for protracted flight. In the same time, conditions favoring, they could have flown from Manhattan to Vienna. They had covered 4,100 miles. To Paris it is 3,600 miles from Manhattan. Jubilant, Engineer Bellanca's employers offered competitors a three-hour headstart in the race to Paris. The Bellanca monoplane's normal cruising speed is 110 m.p.h. She would require only some 35 hours to reach Paris—if she could stay up that long again.
Lindbergh was unable to get the plane, and two weeks after Lindbergh's flight, the "Columbia" flew non-stop from New York to Berlin, Germany, a trip of 3,911 miles which was again longer than the 3,600 mile trip Lindbergh made from New York City to Berlin to capture the Orteig Prize.
The Air Service, Inc. Hangar at Bellanca Airfield was built about 1936, and is built predominately of concrete block with brick detailing at door openings and at the locations of the piers that support the wood roof trusses. It measures 60 feet by 180 feet, and is the only surviving piece of aviation history left at the former Bellanca Airfield.

VAQ-209

Electronic Attack Squadron 209 (VAQ-209) is a United States Navy Reserve electronic attack squadron. Known as the "Star Warriors", the squadron is currently in transition to the Boeing EA-18G "Growler" carrier-based electronic warfare jet aircraft. Based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, WA, it is assigned to the Tactical Support Wing.
Mission.
"To safely train to attain and maintain mobilization readiness for immediate employment in event of war or national emergency."
History.
Creation.
VAQ-209 was established at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia (USA), on 1 October 1977. It was part of the U.S. Navy "Reserve Carrier Air Wing 20 (CVWR-20)". Originally the squadron was equipped with the Grumman EA-6A "Electronic Intruder". 
1990s.
VAQ-209 relocated to Naval Air Facility Washington, on Andrews Air Force Base in May 1990 and began transition to the EA-6B Prowler. The event marked not only the significant upgrading of CVWR-20's electronic attack capability, but also the first assignment of the U.S. Navy's EA-6B aircraft to be home ported outside of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington. In 1995, the "Star Warriors" were mobilized for combat operations over Bosnia and participated in both Operation Deny Flight and Operation Deliberate Force. A four-plane detachment was deployed aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, as part of Carrier Air Wing Eight from 22 March to 22 September 1995.
In 1998, VAQ-209 Deployed to Incirlik AB, Turkey with 3 EA-6B aircraft to conduct combat operations in direct support of Operation Northern Watch. The squadron maintained 100% mission coverage and a 96% sortie completion rate. VAQ-209 was the first "Prowler" squadron to deploy with only 3 aircraft and not miss a single ONW mission, the first Navy Reserve Squadron to deploy to Incirlik in support of ONW, and the first EA-6B squadron to carry HARM into the Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR). Additionally it was the first EA-6B squadron to develop specific Prowler HARM and jamming tactics for ONW operations and ROE, and the first EA-6B squadron to be overall Mission Commander for entire ONW strike packages.
In 1999 the squadron received a 96 hour to prepare to deploy order for Operation ALLIED FORCE (OAF). VAQ-209 deployed in accordance with JCS directive on April 16, 1999 with two aircraft, arriving in Aviano AB, Italy on April 17 via Lajes, Azores. VAQ-209 provided sole maintenance support for VAQ-209, 138, and 140 EA-6B translant aircraft, accompanying the aircraft to Lajes and remaining there until April 20 to support follow-on movement of NAS Whidbey Island Prowlers. VAQ-209 entered combat operations on April 17, 1999 and continued until hostilities ended on June 21, 1999. The Star Warriors redeployed on 25 June 1999 through RAF Mildenhall, NAS Keflevic (RON), Sonder Stromfjord (Greenland), Goose Bay CFB, and NAS Brunswick (RON), arriving in NAF Washington on June 27, 1999. The squadron completed 150 combat sorties and over 550 combat flight hours with a 98% sortie completion rate and no injuries.
2000s.
In March 2000, the squadron deployed to Incirlik AB, Turkey, with 4 aircraft to again support Operation Northern Watch. While in Turkey, VAQ-209 aircrew flew 75 combat sorties and over 250 mishap free flight hours returning to NAF Washington in early May 2000. During the year 2000, VAQ-209 continued its excellent safety record, achieving 23 years and 24,000 hours or mishap free flying.
In the spring of 2001 the squadron deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (PSAB) in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW). This was the first deployment of a reserve EA-6B squadron to the Area of Operations. VAQ-209 completed the 45-day deployment to PSAB, during which they flew 59 combat sorties and 191 flight hours, with a 100% sortie completion rate.
In August 2002, VAQ-209 deployed for the third time to Incirlik AB, Turkey for OPERATION NORTHERN WATCH. This time VAQ-209 flew 88 combat sorties and over 300 flight hours before returning home in October. The squadron went on to set a calendar year flight record of 1539.4 flight hours, a truly notable accomplishment for a reserve squadron.
The Star Warriors deployed to the PACOM theater from April to June 2005. The deployment proved invaluable for training and readiness. Soon after their return from Japan, the Star Warriors once again learned that their combat expertise would be required in support of OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM. In June 2006, VAQ-209 deployed to Al-ASAD Air base, Iraq. There the squadron continued its exemplary record flying over 300 combat sorties for a combined total of more than 1500 flight hours.
Less than two years later, VAQ-209 returned to combat, this time over the skies of Afghanistan. The squadron deployed to support Operation ENDURING FREEDOM from January to March 2008 and once again from March to May 2009. Operating out of Bagram Air Base, the squadron executed over 2000 combat hours of flight time supporting US and ISAF forces on the ground. For their exemplary combat performance, the squadron was recognized as the CNAFR squadron of the year.
The Star Warriors of Electronic Attack Squadron 209 (VAQ-209) returned to Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility (NAF) Washington Nov. 4 2011 following an 85-day deployment in Afghanistan.
During deployment, the Star Warriors flew 193 combat sorties with a mission completion rate of 100 percent, delivering 769 hours of electronic combat suppression against the enemy while the VAQ-209 maintenance department accomplished a combat sortie completion rate of 99.51 percent. The Star Warriors also serviced more than 226 joint tactical air support requests (JTASR).

Farzad Kamangar

Farzad Kamangar (Kurdish: "Ferzad Kemanger" or فه‌رزاد كه‌مانگه‌ر Persian: فرزاد کمانگر) (c. 1978 – May 9, 2010) was a 32-year-old Iranian Kurdish teacher, poet, journalist, human rights activist and social worker from the city of Kamyaran, Iran who was executed on May 9, 2010.
The Accusations and the Courts.
Kamangar was prosecuted on charges of mohareb "enmity towards God". An Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Kamangar to death on February 25, 2008 on charges against national security including being a member of PJAK and active participation in several bombing attacks among which was the 2006 explosion in the Iran-Turkey gas export pipeline. According to his lawyer, Khalil Bahramian, “Nothing in Kamangar’s judicial files and records demonstrates any links to the charges brought against him.”
Bahramian, the lawyer, who was present during the closed-door court hearing, described it as 
“Lasting no more than five minutes, with the Judge issuing his sentence without any explanation and then promptly leaving the room. ... I have seen absolutely zero evidence presented against Kamangar. In my forty years in the legal profession, I have never witnessed such a prosecution.” For this denial, Kamangar was repeatedly tortured. Amnesty International reports that Kamangar was repeatedly beaten, flogged, and electrocuted, and that he now suffers from spasms in his arms and legs as a result of the torture.
The Supreme Court officially confirmed Kamangar's death sentence on July 11, 2008.
Kamangar was one of six political prisoners highlighted in International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran's September 18, 2008 document "Rights Crisis Escalates, Faces and Cases from Ahmadinejad's Crackdown"
Kamangar participated in the hunger strike to protest the execution of Ehsan Fatahian.
Human Rights Organizations' Reaction.
Amnesty International, Education International, and other teachers' and human rights organizations have called for Mr. Kamangar's sentence to be commuted.
Kamangar's Notes.
Kamangar in a piece describes his time at the prison as follows:
""...I spent close to a month in solitary isolation, at the end of the first floor, in section 113 the prison. It had a horrible stench. During this period I was not allowed to have visits nor telephone calls with any member of my family. During the 3 months of solitary confinement I was not allowed to go out in the free air. After enduring these months they moved me to a bigger cell, cell number 10, a cell intended for several persons, and I spent close to two months there. Still I was not allowed to have any contact with a lawyer or my family...""
A part of Kamangar's letter "Be Strong Comrades":
""Is it possible to carry the heavy burden of being a teacher and be responsible for spreading the seeds of knowledge and still be silent? Is it possible to see the lumps in the throats of the students and witness their thin and malnourished faces and keep quiet? Is it possible to be in the year of no justice and fairness and fail to teach the H for Hope and E for Equality, even if such teachings land you in Evin prison or result in your death?""

Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)

Fort Saint-Jean is a fort in the Canadian province of Quebec located on the Richelieu River. The fort was first built in 1666 by soldiers of the Carignan-Salières Regiment and was part of a series of forts built along the Richelieu River. Over the years, it was destroyed and rebuilt several times, but it is, after Quebec City, the military site that has been occupied non-stop for the longest time in Canada. The fort is designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, and it currently houses the Royal Military College of Saint-Jean. The fort has been continually occupied since 1748, and is the core from which the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec grew around. Fort Saint-Jean played a crucial role during the 1775 American invasion of the Province of Quebec.
History.
The First French Fort.
In 1663, the French King Louis XIV decided to take direct command of his New France colony, which had been previously colonized and managed by wealthy merchant associations. As the Iroquois were very often leading punitive expeditions on the New France territories and were continuously trying to steal away the French allies' hunting territories, Louis XIV decided to send the whole Carignan-Salières Regiment to build a series of forts along the Richelieu River and Lake Champlain, which explains why the area was later named the Vallée des Forts (literally: the Forts Valley), and to lead a punitive expedition against the Iroquois. The first Fort Saint-Jean was built along the Richelieu River by the Carignan-Salières Regiment in 1666 for that purpose. This first fort is believed to have been a small square-shaped fort with four bastions made of wooden palisades. It was located right after the Chambly rapids, a highly strategic position that allowed the French to monopolize a very good portage location. The French offensive into Iroquois territory was a great success and thus, a peace treaty was signed between the two parties in 1667. In 1672, after several peaceful years, the Governor of the colony decided to abandon several forts that had become useless along the Richelieu River, including Fort Saint-Jean. Because of its strategic location, Fort Saint-Jean was later to be revived, unlike others French forts such as Sainte-Thérèse and Sainte-Anne.
The Second French Fort.
The second French fort Saint-Jean was built in 1748 because of tensions between France and England arising from the War of the Austrian Succession. It was a fort of two hundred feet by two hundred feet that had four bastions, two of which were made in stone. This fort was an important relay between Montreal and Fort St. Frédéric, which was located in the south of Lake Champlain, because a road linked fort Saint-Jean to La Prairie and allowed the communications between Montreal and St. Frédéric to be considerably shorter. The second fort Saint-Jean was given the sympathetic nickname of “Fort aux Maringouins” (Mosquitoes Fort) because of the swampy climate of the area. This fort was destroyed by French soldiers in 1760 during the French and Indian War. As there were not enough men left to defend the fort against a three to five thousand-man British army coming up from the Richelieu River to take Montreal, the French decided to abandon the fort and before they left for Montreal, they put fire to it as to not leave it to their enemy. The stone bastions of the fort that survived the fire were afterward used as a relay by the British troops.
The 1760 British fort and the American invasion.
Because of the dangers posed by the thirteen rebellious colonies to the South, the British in 1775 erected a third fort on the site of the previous fort. A year before the Declaration of Independence transformed those rebellious colonies into the United States of America, two small armies of rebels invaded the Province of Quebec in an attempt to defeat the British on Canadian soil and to raise Canadian opposition to royal British rule. Fort Saint-Jean played a vital role in the defence of the Province of Quebec against the Americans; indeed, it was the principal defense of Montreal against General Richard Montgomery’s army, which had planned to use the Richelieu River to reach Montreal, then march to Quebec City. The garrison of Fort Saint-Jean fought valiantly against the American troops during a forty-five-day siege before surrendering to the invaders. The siege of Fort Saint-Jean considerably weakened and slowed the American offensive: Montgomery's expedition arrived at Quebec City early in December instead of mid-October, and only three hundred of his men, out of about two thousand, actually reached to Quebec City.
Because of bad weather and the weakened state of the few remaining troops, the Americans failed to take Quebec City in their assault on December 31, 1775. After British reinforcements arrived from England the next Spring, the Americans abandoned and burnt the forts, including Fort Saint-Jean, that they had taken north of Lake Champlain. But, fearing a new American invasion, the British reconstructed a strengthened Fort in 1776, adding a series of new ramparts. They also built in Saint-Jean an important shipyard to assemble the shallow-draft boats needed to follow the Americans on Lake Champlain. These boats later soon would take part in the Battle of Valcour Island.
The 19th-century fortifications.
Fort Saint-Jean lost much of its importance after the end of the American War of Independence in 1783 and was only used as a relay during the second American Invasion in 1812-1814. However, the Patriot Revolt episodes of 1837-1838 convinced the British of the need to fortify again fort Saint-Jean and new buildings were added to the fort. Some of those buildings, built in 1839 by the Royal Engineers, are still standing and being used nowadays on the site.
At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the fort was mostly used as a training school for several groups and regiments, the Royal Canadian Dragoons among them. During the First World War, the Royal 22e Régiment, who was back then only a battalion, was founded and trained at Fort Saint-Jean before being sent to Europe. After the war, the 22nd battalion became the first officially French-speaking Canadian regiment under the name of the Royal 22e Régiment (known in English as the Vandoos). Known between the wars as Cavalry Barracks, fort Saint-Jean also served as a garrison for a Squadron and a company of The Royal Canadian Regiment.
The CMR years.
In 1952, the Royal Military College Saint-Jean was created to allow a greater number of French-speaking Canadians to become officers in the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force, thus becoming the first bilingual military college in Canada. Initially, only first- and second-year courses were offered and cadets had to complete the remainder of their education at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. Over time, the college began offering third- and fourth-year courses and in 1985, it became accredited to grant its own diploma when it received its own Academic Charter.
In 1995, the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean (CMR) was closed due to budget cuts and classes were transferred to RMC Kingston. In order to maintain the CMR site and its buildings in good condition, a non-profit body was created, the Corporation du fort Saint-Jean. The "Campus du Fort Saint-Jean" then became a commercial and public site. The Corporation du Fort Saint-Jean leased some of its educational facilities to institutions such as the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM) for their local programmes while also renting out other facilities for short-term events such as banquets, conventions and weddings. Moreover, the House of Commons' Language School was established in the Massey Building, where many federal Members of Parliament came to improve their French. However, the site never completely lost its military educational vocation; preparatory-year cadets and groups of officers continued to follow courses at Fort Saint-Jean.
In 2008, the military college was reopened and currently offers classes to preparatory, first- and second-year cadets, although it is no longer a degree-granting institution. However, CMR St-Jean remains a commercial site that is open to public, which is unique in Canada. There are both a museum and a multisport complex (including an ice rink and a swimming pool) located on-site.
Fort Saint Jean Museum.
Fort Saint-Jean Museum was founded in 1960 as a private collection of artifacts, military objects and historical documents. With the years, the museum expanded its collection and new offers several instructive exhibitions about the site’s rich military past and history. The Museum was first located in the Old Guardhouse built by the Royal Engineer between 1883 and 1889, but was relocated in 2005 to the CMR’s old Protestant Church to better accommodate its exhibition and customers.
The Musée du Fort Saint Jean has collected some 2,588 pictures for an online photo album illustrative of the history of Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean from 1952 to 1984.
Archaeology at Fort Saint Jean.
In the early 1980s, Parks Canada led archaeological digs at Fort Saint Jean and discovered on that occasion the foundations of a part of the 1748 French fort and plenty of interesting artifacts of both the French and British Regimes. In collaboration with Fort Saint Jean Museum, the Royal Military College of Saint-Jean and Université Laval, a five-year long digging project (2009–2013) taking place in the summer at Fort Saint-Jean. Archaeology students for University Laval are doing excavations from mid-July to mid-August in order to find out more about the past of the site.
The site’s features and historical buildings.
A metal National Historic Site of Canada plaque at the main gate of the college describing the history of Fort Saint-Jean reads,
The DeLery Building, an academic classroom building, was named after Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry, a military engineer who built Fort Saint-Jean in 1748. The Officer’s Mess, the La Galissonière Pavilion, and the Montcalm Pavilion are British buildings that were built in 1839 by the Royal Engineers.
Escadron Richelieu uses Cartier Block and Pavillon Lahaie. Pavillons Vanier, DeLéry, Dextraze, Massey and the Old Mess are shared. The campus provides state-of-the-art technological support: library, well-equipped laboratories, ample supplies of learning materials, and Internet access.

491 Gallery

The 491 Gallery was a squatted social centre and multi-disciplinary gallery in Leytonstone, London, England, that operated from 2001 to 2013. Taking its name from its street number, 491 Grove Green Road, the former factory was home to a community-led art organisation and served as an exhibition space for a diverse range of artists of different origins working in varied media. It contained a range of art and music studios, which were used to host workshops, classes and musical rehearsals.
Origin.
The building, originally a factory, was later used as a storage space and warehouse for materials being used to construct the A12 that cuts through Leytonstone and the surrounding areas. Unlike the rest of the surrounding buildings, it and the few neighbouring houses were not subject to compulsory purchase orders and demolition for the A12 site. When in late 2000 the building was abandoned, it became occupied by a group of homeless drug users, who remained in it for some six months. Within a month of their vacating the premises, the building was reoccupied by a group of artists, who spent the next several years turning it into a community space. The neighbouring building, formerly houses, was also occupied, and named Vertigo, after the film by Alfred Hitchcock, a famous resident of Leytonstone.
Activities.
The 491 Gallery and Vertigo collectively collaborated on hosting regular exhibitions and offered studio space for musicians to use. They were maintained largely through small donations made by the public. Transport for London, the 491 building's legal owner at the time, agreed to allow the continued use of the building, although no formal arrangement was made with the occupants. The owner of the Vertigo building allows its use for an annual peppercorn rent of £1. The Gallery regularly hosted art exhibitions, themed events and film screenings, such as a Transition Towns screening of .
Following a fire in 2008, the Vertigo building was rebuilt throughout by its residents, and in 2009 was decorated with an exterior mural of Hitchcock to add to the artistic tributes in the local area, such as the mosaics in the neighbouring Leytonstone tube station.
Closure.
In June 2012, Transport for London sold the building. The new owners were believed to want to demolish the building to build a block of flats.
On January 14, 2013, the 491 Gallery closed and was given to the new owners. The Vertigo building was not subject to sale, and remains.

The Hinman Settler Road was constructed by former Revolutionary War veteran Timothy Hinman from 1791-1795 in Orleans County, Vermont. Hinman's intent was to help develop the land he owned in Derby. 
The road is long. It starts at the Bayley Hazen Military Road in Greensboro. It proceeds north from there. When it reaches Glover, it follows the Barton River Valley north through the village of Barton. North of that village it follows the Maple Hill Road north, running through what is now the Orleans Country Club to Brownington. It continues north through Derby to the Canadian border. It is nearly straight, bearing about 19 degrees from north.
Most of the road was used well into the nineteenth and often, the twentieth century. Some of the road has become state road, for example in Glover, it became Vermont Route 16. In other places, it is unmaintained, for example in Barton, it leaves Maple Hill Road and becomes a "class 4" (town owned, but not maintained) road until it gets to the golf course.
In Brownington, it is a major route and known by the historic name.

Hadi Ghabel

Hadi Ghabel is an Iranian cleric and member of the central council of the reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front. He was imprisoned on April 7, 2008 to begin a 40- month jail term following prosecution and conviction by the Special Court for the Clergy. The Special Court, charged with investigating other clerics for alleged crimes, has prosecuted clerics who challenge official religious interpretations of the Islamic Republic. According to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, "the court’s prosecution of religious scholars, based solely on their beliefs and opinions constitutes a form of modern inquisition aimed at rooting out clerics whose beliefs are considered politically threatening."
According to roozonline, security agents approached Ghabel’s house in April 2008 "on the pretext of having religious questions." When the cleric appeared at the front of his house, the agents "pushed their way inside and after searching the rooms confiscated his papers, writings and computer, and took him to prison." After his arrest, Hadi Ghabel was taken to the Clerics Court and "interrogated repeatedly during his two month detention" despite "the express legal provisions that political crimes must be reviewed in the presence of a jury and must be public."
Ghabel was sentenced to one year in prison for “acting against national security,” 10 months for “propaganda against state,” 15 months for “disturbing public opinion,” 100 days for “aspersion of the clergy,” and a financial fine of 5 million Rials ($550 USD) for “insulting the authorities.” He was also defrocked.

<doc id="19416159" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19416159" title="E11 European long distance path">
E11 European long distance path

The E11 European long distance path or E11 path is one of the European long-distance paths, running 2560 km (about 1600 miles) west-east from The Hague in the Netherlands through Germany and Poland to the Lithuanian border. It starts in Scheveningen, a fishing community, commercial harbor and spa in The Hague on the Dutch coast of the North Sea. As there are no rambling organizations from Lithuania, Latvia or Russia participating in the European Ramblers' Association, it is unlikely that the E11 will be extended to reach Saint Petersburg or Moscow, as was foreseen originally. 
The E11 is one of three European long distance paths running East from the Benelux to Eastern Poland. In the North, following the German and Polish coasts of North Sea and Baltic Sea, the E9 offers a variety of polders, sandy beaches, dunes and commercial harbors. More to the South, the E3 crosses through the long range of medium-sized mountains that links the mainly Belgian Ardennes to the Carpathian Mountains. The E11 takes an intermediate course through the rolling lowlands of Northern Germany and Poland. Nowhere does it touch a sea (not even the North Sea, as E11 starts in Scheveningen behind the first rows of buildings!), but it passes a single medium-sized mountain range, the Harz Mountains in the center of Germany. European long distance footpaths are strictly developed as hiking trails, but almost all of E11 can be travelled on a saddle - be it on a horse or a bicycle. 
This article presents an encyclopedic overview of the trail. Detailed information about the routing is found in . Links to detailed information about the townships along E11 are found in a special group of references at the bottom of this article.
Geology and biology.
Most of the (original, pre-human) landscape along E11 was formed in the last 14,000 years, i.e. in the current Holocene or warmer period since the last ice age. The melting ice in Northern Europe caused huge rivers to carve out wide valleys, whilst the sea level rose significantly and flooded low land. It is known that the river Thames in England was once a tributary of the river Rhine on the continent; Britain was then not separated from the continent by the North Sea. In what is now known as the Netherlands and in the plains of (now) Northern Germany and Poland, rivers began to flow to carry the melted ice towards what became the Baltic Sea (itself also a result of the rising sea level) or the North Sea. These areas are now characterized by low lying land, marshes, sandy old dunes (now stationary hills) alternating with older layers of peat. 
From the Dutch and German border to the Harz, however, E11 passes through a different and much older geological area. It consists of a range of low mountain ridges (such as the Wiehen Hills and the Wesergebirge), created almost 100 million years ago from marine sediments which started to rise. The Harz mountains themselves are even much older (about 300 million years according to academic estimates) and stem from a variety of complicated geological processes. After the Harz, E11 drops back to the estuaries of the rivers in the plains. 
Large parts of the E11 cross through forests, for which sometimes considerable detours are made. Open scenery is found in small parts of The Netherlands as well as in Eastern Germany and around the Polish city of Poznań. Nevertheless, the E11 links some interesting cities, such as The Hague, Amersfoort, Deventer, Osnabruck, Goslar, Luther's Wittenberg, Berlin, Frankfurt (Oder), Poznań, Gniezno, Toruń, Olsztyn, Lidzbark Warmiński and Kętrzyn. Lakes and rivers are not uncommon along the trail. The trail can be walked at any time of year, but the Polish winter is long, with a lot of snow. The highest point of E11 is 514 meters on the slopes of the Harz Mountains, whereas the lowest point is slightly under sea level in one of the polders in the West of The Netherlands. 
Apart from getting lost in the vast Polish forests, there seem to be few hazards other than the occasional wild boar or gray wolf, or even a rare Eurasian lynx. It is only at the end of a severe winter season, when the animals are hungry, that extra care must be taken. In the summer, one might tread on a poisonous adder and in any season one might be biten by a rabies infected mammal. The one really big danger, however, is the almost invisible tick as it may be infected with tick-borne diseases, especially Lyme disease and tick-borne meningoencephalitis.
History.
In a sense, E11 is the oldest European footpath among the ERA network. There is archeological evidence that messengers and traders followed the range of low hills in what is now Northern Germany, thousands of years ago. Especially after the Middle Ages, the route became a backbone of East-West trade. Pedlars and other travelers preferred the dry and sandy ridge to the swamps to the North and South of it. At present, ramblers feel the same for a different reason: the forested hilltops are more pleasant to walk in than the congested lower areas. 
From 1970, a regional hiking trail in Germany was gradually extended into The Netherlands until in 1980 the twin cities Haarlem and Osnabruck could present an ongoing international long distance path from West of Amsterdam to the then internal German border in the Harz Mountains. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the unification of Germany in 1990, the need was felt to extend the trail to the East on a partially new course, partially making use of existing trails in the former East Germany. 
Parallel to the extension of the European Union to the East, the E11 was extended over the existing network of Polish local and regional hiking trails. The extension of the E11 to Moscow through Lithuania and Latvia has not so far been possible, due to the absence of rambling organizations in the three countries involved.
E11 in The Netherlands (355 km).
The Dutch section of E11 is known as the Marskramerpad ("Peddlers Way"), paying tribute to those who walked through the centuries along the same track. The Marskramerpad links Scheveningen in The Hague over 368 kilometers to the German township of Bad Bentheim. The last 13 km are in Germany, which leaves 355 km for the Netherlands. Like most Dutch long distance trails, the Marskramerpad is managed by Wandelnet, where a detailed guide of the trail can be bought. 
The Marskramerpad links some typically Dutch landscapes, such as the wetlands and polders in the West of the country, and the sandy hills and broad river valleys in the Center and East of the country. It also crosses some of the most interesting towns and cities, including The Hague, Leiden, Amersfoort, Deventer and Oldenzaal.
EUREGIO exploits the eastern part of the Marskramerpad and its continuation in Germany (together forming the stretch Deventer - Bad Bentheim - Osnabrück) under the name of Handelsweg.
E11 in Germany (996 km).
The first 13 kilometers in Germany, through Gildehaus and Bad Bentheim, are part of the Dutch Marskramerpad. In the rest of Germany, E11 follows some old regional trails, a remnant of the Wanderweg Harz - Niederlande (Hiking Trail Harz - Netherlands) and a newly created routing in the former GDR. It crosses former West-Germany on a chain of ridges running from West to East, then passes the Harz Mountains without going higher than 514 meters, and finally gives an impression of the large-scale agrarian enterprises that were founded by the Brandenburg-Prussian nobility in the 17th century, and continued to exist in the form of People's Owned Companies during the GDR. The metropolis of Berlin is crossed from Potsdam through the town centre to Friedrichshagen. E11 leaves German territory on the Oder/Odra bridge linking Frankfurt (Oder) to Słubice in Poland.
Töddenweg and Wittekindsweg (205 km).
After Bad Bentheim, E11 follows the border between the German federal states (Länder) of Lower Saxony and Northrhine-Westphalia over about 200 kilometers, which means that one crosses their border at least every day. This is true for both the Töddenweg and the Wittekindsweg, which form the respective continuations of the Marskramerpad. 
The Töddenweg (a regional name to be translated as Peddlers Way) used to begin in Oldenzaal in The Netherlands, but has its start now in Bad Bentheim, an old siege of German nobility with a medieval castle (partly museum) and a functioning spa. A set of 3 maps can be downloaded or ordered from EUREGIO. A different map can be obtained from the website Spazieren.de. In its present form, from Bad Bentheim to Osnabrück, the Töddenweg measures 110 kilometers. It is marked by stickers with a white capital T on a black square, or by a simple T painted on trees and walls. It cruises slightly elevated above the surrounding agrarian land. 
The continuation after Osnabrück's monumental railway station is called Wittekindsweg (Widukind's Way), named after Widukind, an 8th-Century war leader who long upheld the conquest of Saxony by Charlemagne. Remarkable is that his long and brave resistance resulted in his appointment as the first Duke of Saxony under Charlemagne. Just before the sensational descent to Porta Westfalica, the trail passes the giant monument to the honor of Wilhelm I, German Emperor from 1871 till his death in 1888. The building is placed in such a way, that even today, all who pass in a train or on the motorway, see it high on the slope that ends the Wiehengebirge.
Eastern Lower Saxony and Harz Mountains (186 km).
After Porta Westfalica E11 remains in Lower Saxony for almost 200 kilometers. It follows the 50 kilometers of a regional hiking trail, the Wesergebirgsweg, cruising over de crest of the next ridge, the Weser Uplands to the medieval town of Hameln. E11 reaches a height of 440 meters on Mount Hohe Egge, amidst of breath-taking rocks and ancient forests. It then crosses the open downs around Hameln (junctions with E1) and Coppenbrügge, near the rivers Hamel and Weser. The latter township offers the last possibility for shopping before E11 climbs the next ridge, the Ith and remains on its crest over its full length. 
Passing Eschershausen, medieval Alfeld (Leine), the Helleberg ("Mount Hell") and Bad Gandersheim, E11 reaches the Harz Mountains at the township of Seesen. Although the mountain range offers summits of 1000 meters and more (the famous Brocken is over 1400 meters high), E11 does not climb higher than 500 meters and keeps mostly to the lower parts of the northern slopes. It crosses through a few townships well-known from early German history: Goslar (junctions with E6) and Bad Harzburg. The little River Ecker used to be the German-German border and now separates the federal states of Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.
Harz Mountains and Saxony-Anhalt (244 km).
In the years after the fall of the Iron Curtain and German reunification, the Harz Club put much effort into restoring the network of rambling trails in the Eastern part of the Harz Mountains. This resulted "inter alia" in a completely new extension of E11 through the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt. It passes Ilsenburg and Ballenstedt, finally breaks through the crest of the Harz Mountains (which are hills rather than mountains here), and reaches the town of Lutherstadt Eisleben, the birthplace of Martin Luther, the church reformer, and bears his name in its official name. 
A further extension, long planned, but realized only in 2007, leads E11 through mining and large-scale agricultural country to the Natural Park of the Lower Saale (Naturpark Unteres Saaletal). E11 continues to the city of Halle. This remarkable town survived the Second World War almost undamaged and retains a great number of buildings reflecting Jugendstil, Bauhaus and other architectural styles. The path west of Halle is waymarked in the same manner as the previous parts, i.e. a white cross (X), possibly on a black square. 
After Halle, E11 climbs the lonely hill of Petersberg and continues through flat, open land. The scenery reflects both the large scale of agrarian enterprises in the new federal states as well as the influence of Brandenburg-Prussian nobility in the 18th and 19th centuries. E11 reaches the city of Dessau, the cradle of Bauhaus architecture, then plunges into the interesting Biosphere Reserve of the Middle Elbe. It passes Coswig and enters the forest around Senst. Shortly after this village, E11 reaches the border with the federal state of Brandenburg. After Halle, E11 is waymarked according to the traditional system in former communist Europe: three horizontal stripes, white, blue and white, which may also be interpreted as a blue stripe on a white square.
Brandenburg and Berlin (348 km).
E11 enters Brandenburg near Gross-Marzehns and crosses broad treeless agrarian land towards the picturesque town of Belzig. The trail continues through vast hunting forests, which were the property of the Brandenburg-Prussian nobility in the 19th century and served as a green belt around Berlin and Potsdam in the 20th century. About 20 kilometers before Potsdam, E11 reaches the first of a score of lakes bordered by many former East German holiday resorts, some of which are still in use. In front of Potsdam's monumental central railway station (Potsdam Hauptbahnhof) E11 meets E10, running North-South and also marked white-blue-white. 
Crossing Potsdam near the Central Railway Station takes little time as E11 avoids the interesting historical town center and the luxurious palaces of the former dukes of Brandenburg, who became kings of Prussia and emperors of Germany. E11 sneaks through one of the hottest spots on the former border of West Berlin, Klein Glienicke. This little settlement, enclosed by water and divided by an indented border, was packed full of spies by both superpowers during the Cold War. The Glienicke Bridge witnessed the opening and subsequent fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. 
The routing through former West Berlin surprises with a vast area of forest before the Olympic Stadium in Charlottenburg is reached. This part of Berlin is rich in historical castles, including the winter residence of the Prussian kings, who also founded a few museums here. Most of the famous museums of Berlin are, however, found in Mitte (the historical center of Berlin and also the center of the former East Berlin. E11 does not pass here, but follows an old trail in West Berlin along the River Spree and the Landwehr Canal, thus missing the most interesting parts of East Berlin and present-day Berlin. 
The borough of Köpenick is where E11 enters former East Berlin. E11 lingers leisurely between the River Spree and a few recreational parks and then crosses the river by ferry into a vast area of town houses and bungalows to Friedrichshagen. Here, E11 leaves the urban area behind to venture to the North into one of the most beautiful parts of the trail, the valley of the little river Erpe or Neuenhagener Mühlenfließ. Turning East, the trail now passes through Neuenhagen and the Märkische Schweiz Nature Park to Gusow near the town of Seelow. From here, the rambler may choose a more western trail over the hills of Lebus to Jacobsdorf or, more to the East, the trail that, after the village of Reitwein, follows the River Oder to the South. Both variants meet each other in Frankfurt (Oder), where the German part of E11 ends on the bridge over the Oder to Poland.
In Brandenburg and Berlin, E11 is marked in various ways. This part of E11 is described in the German language, A list of 150 addresses which offer lodgings for the night en route, also in German, is found in specialized bookshops in Germany. Some useful information is found at Fernwege.de, but as such not enough to follow the trail. It is strongly advised to carry a city plan of Berlin when walking from Potsdam to Neuenhagen. Locally bought topographical maps will do for the rest of the trail in Brandenburg.
E11 in Poland (1177 km).
In Poland, E11 continues east, then northeast, to pass the cities of Międzychód, Poznań, Gniezno, Toruń, Brodnica, Iława, Olsztyn and Gołdap to the township of Ogrodniki, Sejny County on the Lithuanian border. As 30% of Poland is covered with forest, it is not surprising that most of E11 crosses through vast areas with trees (mostly planted and exploited commercially), and various wild areas, such as lakes and dunes. Near Poznań, however, the rambler walks for days through agrarian and semi-industrial land, made pleasant by some ancient towns and buildings. As Poland is rather thinly populated, ramblers without tents must be prepared for daily distances between 25 and 35 kilometers. 
No Polish regional trail is, as a whole, part of E11. The trail rather jumps from one existing trail to another, generally after following such a trail for only a short distance. Moreover, E11 is not itself waymarked on the route, with a few exceptions which may amount to one sign every 100 km. The regional trails are marked, however, although not always well enough to enable the rambler to follow E11 without a map. 
Some topographical maps show sections of E11, but others may only show the trails that form the basis of it. So one must fall back on documents describing which sections of which trails make up E11. Unfortunately, these are hardly accessible or incomplete: 
1. A German book, now out of sale, and summarizing the routing of all eleven European long distance paths. 
2. A series of Polish topographical maps (with legend in English) showing hiking trails, but not always indicating which of these belong to E11. These and some more detailed maps may be ordered from abroad at the specialized map shop Grupa.18 in Poznań. 
3. Later changes in the Polish routing can be found (in Polish) in the offices of PTTK, the Polish tourist organization. and (in English) at the secretariat of the European Ramblers' Association in Prague.
Oder bridge - Międzyrzecz (141 km).
Once the bridge across the River Oder (and the now open border between Germany and Poland) has been passed, E11 (here unmarked) goes straight through the town center of Słubice, until 1945 a suburban part of Frankfurt (Oder) under the name of Dammvorstadt, but a separate township in a different country since then. Two kilometers out of town, E11 curbs left toward the little village of Drzecin, where the first white-yellow-white markings are found. These lead in a few days to Lubniewice, where the markings change to white-blue-white. The blue trail passes Kursko and leads to Kęszyca Leśna, a former army base of the Soviet Red Army that now tries to build up a second life as an industrial and tourist settlement. The former staff quarters now function as a hotel, where the hiker may rest as a Soviet general. A little further lies Kęszyca, where a German system of underground corridors and strongholds can be visited. This dates back to 1928, when democratic Germany (the Weimar Republic) felt the need to defend itself against a possible attack from the East with a so-called Ostwall. In 1938 already, this defense system started to deteriorate as dictator Adolf Hitler was more interested in attacking himself to the East and saw no need for a defense system that, from his point of view, lay somewhere inland in his dreamed Great Germany. The spot offers now the unique possibility of following E11 underground.
The blue trail carries E11 on to the township of Gościkowo, where the Paradyż Abbey sometimes hosts tired ramblers overnight, provided they accept the sober rules of monk life. After Gościkowo, white-green-white marks lead through some 30 km of forest to Bobowicko. Actually, between Kursko and Bobowicko, E11 follows a large bow around the city of Międzyrzecz. The city has bus and train connections with various townships on E11 and may be used as a pleasant station for two or three days of walking without much luggage. Bobowicko is at walking distance (2 km) from the train and bus stations of Międzyrzecz. Due to its train connections to Poznań and Germany, Międzyrzecz is also a good place to end or start a tour of one or more weeks along E11. The city has an interesting regional museum and a lively score of restaurants and bars.
Międzyrzecz - Poznań-Kiekrz (133 km).
From Bobowicko, the green trail continues till after Stołuń, where E11 begins to follow white-blue-white to Villa Toscana, a lonely hotel between the villages of Nowe Gorzycko and Stare Gorzycko. The blue trail and E11 continue to the twin cities of Międzychód and Bielsko, which offer many opportunities for shopping (fashion, antiquities, arts) and staying overnight. E11 now enters the area that, for a long time, was No Man's Land and War Front Zone between Prussia (later the German Empire) and Poland. Many monuments remind of this tragedy, but unfortunately the explanatory texts are in Polish only. In Bukowar the markings change to white-red-white and in Obrzycko to white-green-white. Słopanowo marks the end of the forests; E11 now enters the agrarian open space of the province of Greater Poland around the city of Poznań. There are no marks after Szamotuły. The village of Kiekrz is where E11 reaches Poznań.
E11 through Poznań (33 km).
From behind the railway station of Kiekrz, a white-green-white marked trail leads through a vast city park to Golęcin, from where a few black or blue marks guide the rambler to the tramway stop of Sołacz and Nad Wierzbakiem. After this point, E11 is not defined, but the obvious choice of a rambler interested in one of the oldest, biggest and most beautiful town centers along E11 is to turn right (South) toward Rynek Jezycki. Here begins The Royal-Imperial Route in Poznań which, in a more or less straight West-East line, passes all touristical highlights of Poznań. This tourist trail ends at the medieval little Church of St. John of Jerusalem Outside the Walls near Lake Malta. The quiet Northern shore of this Jezioro Maltańskie offers interesting views of the many sports accommodations on and around the lake and guides the E11 rambler to the zoo and the start of the well-marked but curving Cistercian bicycle track (black monks on a white field or simple black stripes). Lodgings and buses back to town are found just across the border of the city in Gruszczyn. The last residential area of Poznań is Zieliniec.
Poznań-Zieliniec - Gniezno (55 km).
Crossing the main road in Gruszczyn, E11 goes straight, in line with Map N-33-131/132, to Pobiedziska. E11 passes over a tar road through a nondescript area of small businesses and workshops related to agriculture. Later, it ventures into forest until finally all black or green markings leave the path and die somewhere in the forest and the dunes. One should rather follow the nearby tar road to the North, to the township of Pobiedziska, where E11 is found back. Away from the track, to the West of the town, open-air museum Skansen welcomes visitors with miniature copies of buildings from a wide area.
In Pobiedziska itself, the Ulica Gnieźnieńska at the left of the church on the central square of Pobiedziska carries E11 out of town. Through open, mostly agrarian land, the scattered houses of Lednogóra are reached, where white-red-white markings join the trail. This is from now on the colour of E11 over more than 100 kilometres. Along a swampy lake and a crossing in the main road #5 (at the crossing a road sign says that it is now 22.2 kilometres to Gniezno), E11 reaches the railway station of Fałkowo, which is crossed at full length. Here E11 has been forced to make place for a motorway. After Leśniewo scarce white-red-white signs can be found again, leading the aware and persistent rambler to Gniezno. 
Gniezno was the first capital of Poland, way back in the Middle Ages, but it is now dreaming away as a provincial town. Old and beautiful houses and other buildings around the central square testify of an interesting past, whilst decaying factories refer to the recent communist past. The university offers the most lively corner of the town. The white-red-white marks of E11 lead along the most interesting churches, museums and other sites, and finally to the railway station.
Gniezno - Toruń (136 km).
A few signs in front of the railway station of Gniezno indicate distances along the red-marked trail that is E11. The 40 km to Mogilno are correct, but the distance to Kruszwica is severely exaggerated. The trail follows the road parallel to the tracks to the Northeast and turns then right into a tunnel under the railway. After another right turn, it passes through a modern industrial area, older residential quarters and a surprisingly wild patch of forest. The red markings lead through open agrarian land to the long-stretched industrial village of Trzemeszno. The trail passes in front of the railway station, crosses the tracks a little further, and reaches Mogilno via the village of Wydartowo. The white-red-white stripes die out in Mogilno. E11, now invisible, turns right in the little park around the lake, not far from the railway station, and immediately right again, to follow the waterside toward the medieval Benedictine monastery. E11 turns left (East) to the lonely motel of Goryszewo Kwieciszewo, where the first white-red-white stripes since Mogilno are found. The trail passes through Jeziorki and follows a sandy dirt road to Strzelno. 
After Strzelno, a Polish Way of St. James follows more or less the same route as the E11, so that the yellow and blue shells yield an alternative marking to reach Polanowice. In this soviet-industrial village two rusty signs with white-red-white stripes are found, which still clearly indicate E11 (200 km after the previous E11 sign!). A rustic tree lane brings the rambler to Kruszwica, a provincial town with some interesting churches, but no clue where E11 and the Way of St. James continue. Gorges invites to look for a trail marked blue, but the only blue trail to be found makes a short circuit through a suburb of Kruszwica. A better bet is to follow the busy main road to the North, which is marked with the shells of St.James. After 7 km, near Łojewo, one may take a quiet asphalt road, soon unpaved and marked blue. The blue signs lead finally through long-stretched suburbs to the city center of Inowrocław. 
Near the railway station of Inowrocław a torn map of the city is found, which indicates where the red-marked E11 leaves the town. The insufficiently marked trail crosses the fields of Kolonie Szadłowice and enters the forests of Błoto Ostrowskie. Finally, one comes to the village of Wierzbiczany, from where both the red markings and the blue shells of St.James lead through agrarian land to the center of Gniewkowo. They follow a right curve and leave the town on the asphalt road towards Cierpice to the North. The trails now enter a large forest, leave the tar road after some kilometers and make a wide curve of 16 km to the village of Cierpice, the first of a chain of suburbs of Toruń. In spite of Gorges, E11 no longer passes through Suchatówka. The blue trail ends at the PTTK office in the town centre of Toruń.
Toruń - Brodnica (87 km).
From the PTTK office in Toruń, E11 is identical to a trail marked white-yellow-white, which leads all the way to Samborowo, 200 km to the Northeast. E11 and St. James Way avoid the historical town center of Toruń and pass between the old city walls and the river Wisla, but it is far more interesting to cross the city center from the PTTK office by Różana, Szeroka and Wielkie Garbary to the train station of Toruń-Miasto. Out of town, the trails follow a main road till Fort Sobieskiego. They turn right into the forest near the river Wisla, enter suburbs and later pass through forest for a couple of hours. After crossing the busy motorway A10 near Brzozówka, E11 turns left into an overgrown footpath between fields and later reaches Mierzynek over a sandy road. From Lelitowo to Ciechocin and again to Golub-Dobrzyń, E11 continues through a variety of natural and commercial forests along the river Drwęcą. 
E11 leaves the twin cities without markings near the Post Office and the cemetery on National Road # 534. The trail follows roughly the river Drwęcą to the North-East, and the first yellow signs are found in the forest. The trail then alternates between river side woods and agrarian settlements. Some of these remind of the composer Chopin who spent holidays in this area and now has a museum in Szafarnia. In Radziki Duże E11 turns left over a paved road with heavy lorries carrying loads from a sand quarry. It takes about an hour to reach a bridge over the Drwęcą and escape from the road into the forest on the other side of the river. This sandy forest road continues till Mszano, but in a new suburb under Szabda it turns into a paved road and subsequently a boring main road leading to Brodnica.
Brodnica - Olsztyn (237 km).
E11 and St. James Way leave Brodnica well-marked, but avoiding the nice but neglected old city centre. The trails follow Motorway A15 and an abandoned railway track into forest, and meets the A15 again near the bridges of Tama Brodzka. Right after the bridge, the trails turn left into a small paved forest lane leading to Bachotek, where they split. E11 makes a few curves near Jezioro Zbiczno and meets a trail marked green. Here the yellow signs are missing, but the green signs must be followed to the North until a paved road. The asphalt is followed to the East over about one kilometer between two lakes. Here the green trail and the yellow-marked E11 split up. E11 passes twice near the tourist resort of Ciche and turns West to Gorále, then North to the railway station of Ostrowite, and finally East. 
The yellow-marked E11 continues to the East until Radomno, where it unites with St. James Way and turns North to Iława. They pass the modern center of the city, which was heavily destroyed in the Second World War, and continue North by Szalkowo to Tynwald, then East to Samborowo. From here a blue-marked section of E11 leads to Waplewo, passing the forested tourist resort of Wysoka Wieś and the historical site of the Battle of Grunwald (1410). Yearly re-enactments of this victory of Poland over Germans keep its memory alive. 
Between Waplewo and Olsztyn, E11 makes a long half-circle through two natural reserves. The first protects the springs of the Łyna River, which E11 then begins to follow all the way through Olsztyn to Lidzbark Warmiński. A little further down is the conservation area of Las Warminski, which is especially interesting. It shows the results of decades of minimal management, with nature returning to its course before mankind settled in the area. Rare species may be encountered here, including the Eurasian lynx, according to a local signpost.
Olsztyn - Gołdap (243 km).
The historical city center of Olsztyn with its variety of museums, restaurants, theatres and hotspots for night life is without doubt a place where even the most fanatic E11 rambler wants to spend a day of rest. It is the gateway to the former coreland of the Teutonic Order, now characterized by little towns with remnants of huge castles. Of these, E11 passes Dobre Miasto, Lidzbark Warmiński, Bisztynek, Reszel and Kętrzyn. Other buildings remind of the more recent, but also Roman Catholic past, for example the Palace of the bishops of Warmia at Smolajny, the monastery of Stoczek and the shrine of Święta Lipka.
Gołdap - Lithuanian border (144 km).
In Gołdap, E11 offers a choice between a trail marked white-green-white that comes very close to the Russian border, or a white-red-white trail along the main road to the East. Both trails meet again after 31 km in Stanczyki. The green trail passes through uninhabited woodland and should not be recommended to ramblers with a weak sense of orientation, or those who fear Russian red tape when crossing the border unintentionally and without visa. That one reaches the Russian border before Lithuania, may be surprising to those who are not aware that Russia has an exclave around Kaliningrad, formerly German Königsberg. 
E11 ends at the Polish-Lithuanian border post at 3 km from Ogrodniki. Here is no possibility to spend the night, the nearest lodgings are found in Sejny, 11 km along the main road, or 13 km by following the black trail back and then the red trail to the right. Those who venture into Lithuania may find a guesthouse in Lazdijaj. Both towns have no train connections; to take a train home or to an airport, one may follow the red trail from Sejny over 25 km to the railway station of Trakiszki near Puńsk. There are also railway stations in the Polish city of Suwałki and the Lithuanian city of Sestokai. Be prepared to wait long; there seems to be only one train in either direction from these places except Suwałki that offers three trains daily to Białystok.

37th National Hockey League All-Star Game

The 37th National Hockey League All-Star Game was held in the Olympic Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta, home of the Calgary Flames, on February 12, 1985. The Wales Conference defeated the Campbell Conference 6–4. The game's most valuable player was Mario Lemieux, who became the only rookie to win All-Star MVP honours.
Host city.
The 37th All-Star Game marked the first time the event was held in Calgary. The game was held in the two-year old Olympic Saddledome, which had been built following the Flames arrival in Calgary, and in anticipation of the 1988 Winter Olympics. A sell-out crowd of 16,825 attended the game, and the gala also sold out. In total, $100,000 was raised by the Flames which was donated to charity. The traditional black-tie nature of the banquet and gala were eschewed for this game as the hosts asked attendees to dress up in western wear.
Campbell Conference and Edmonton Oilers head coach Glen Sather expressed displeasure that the fans in Calgary did not let go of the Battle of Alberta for the game. He took issue with the fans booing Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky during the player introductions and the game itself. "It's embarrassing when they boo Wayne when he touches the puck. They booed him once before when he was hurt so..." For his part, Gretzky downplayed Sather's concerns: "I've certainly got nothing against them booing me. I kind of get a kick out of it."
Highlights.
For the first time, the NHL named honorary captains for each team. Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender Glenn Hall was named the honorary captain of the Campbell Conference, while Guy Lafleur, who had retired only three months previous, represented the Wales Conference. Lafleur returned to the game four years later, and thus became the only person to play in the NHL after serving as an honorary All-Star captain. The ceremonial faceoff was performed by Canadian astronaut Marc Garneau and used a puck that he had taken into outer space.
Mario Lemieux entered the game facing criticism from former NHL coach, and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commentator, Don Cherry who stated that Lemieux was a "floater" in reference to Lemieux's lack of defensive play during the season. The 19-year-old rookie dismissed Cherry's arguments, stating that "the Penguins asked me to play offensively, not to care about my defensive play." Lemieux recorded two goals, including the game winner, and added an assist to earn honours as the game's most valuable player. Lemieux is the only player in All-Star Game history to win the award in his rookie year.
Edmonton's Mike Krushelnyski and Boston's Ray Bourque were named the second and third stars of the game. Bourque led all players offensively by recording four assists for the Wales Conference while Krushelnyski led the Campbell Conference with three assists. Neither of the Flames representatives scored. The game featured an increased European flavour when compared to previous All-Star Games. Four European players participated. Swedes Anders Hedberg and Pelle Lindbergh played for the Wales Conference. Swede Thomas Gradin, Czech Miroslav Frycer and Finn Jari Kurri represented the Campbell Conference. Hedberg and Frycer each scored a goal for their respective conferences.

He has produced a comprehensive filmic and artistic oeuvre and has also done performance art and acted in other directors’ films (Cynthia Beatt, Silke Grossmann, Stefan Hayn, Birgit and Wilhelm Hein, Ken Jacobs, Sheila McLaughlin, Sandra Nettelbeck, Elfi Mikesch, Lior Shamriz, Joseph Vilsmaier, Klaus Wyborny a.o.).
Films.
Emigholz’s first films, dating back to the early 1970s and the context of avant-garde and Experimental film, display "a complex interaction between abstract temporal compositions – or filmic movements, respectively – and selected urban and natural landscapes" (Emigholz) In "Demon" (1976/77), he began to examine words. The film explores the prose poem "Le Démon de l’Analogie" (The Demon of Analogy) by Stéphane Mallarmé. "Just as previous films were cut so that fixed features of the landscape and their connections met with a score, in this film, there is one shot for each word." (Frieda Grafe) Emigholz included narrative and scenic elements in "Normalsatz / Ordinary Sentence" (1978–81) and his subsequent films. His visual composition and framing, which establishes a phenomenological relationship to space, is striking, as it ignores the conventional perpendicularity and the central perspective. "The visual space is always populated in the films rather than being empty space whose coordinates are fixed to categories borrowed from abstract geometry, such as the horizon and the vanishing point. Where there is a space, there is also a body that defines it, even if it be via its negative form, absence." (Ronald Balczuweit) This type of construction of space remains defining for his series "Photography and beyond", a "collection of films that can be combined freely and that deal with products designed by humans – architecture, drawings, writings, sculpture" (Emigholz). The series was established in 1993 and drew on previous work from the 1970s and 1980s. The films of the subseries "Architecture as Autobiography" show the extant buildings by architects, civil engineers and designers such as Bruce Goff, Adolf Loos, Robert Maillart, Rudolph Schindler, Louis Sullivan and others in chronological order.
About film Emigholz states: "As a technical medium, film projects the spaces of memory themselves rather than presenting them solely by means of a mental trick. The media of writing, drawing, photography, film, electronic imagery and computing have shifted the complex art of recollection into a readily-available array of technically -generated storage systems. The ancient art of the rhetorician is still present, albeit in rudimentary form, in the memorizing of text by actors and speakers.
Art.
In New York in 1974, Emigholz began to work on "Die Basis des Make-Up/The Basis of Make-Up," a series which grew to more than 600 drawings by 2008. The title goes back to the caption of a photo showing a skull in a makeup textbook from the 1930s. All the drawings were in black and white and were published as photographic prints in the format 54 x 64 cm. Like many of his films, they were developed from the artist’s notebooks which he uses to record sketches of his own texts and to paste various specimens of civilization garbage, sentences overheard on the street or on television, advertising, diagrams from military textbooks and much more. These bits and pieces were transformed in the drawings and films and were connected to one another in austere compositions, but their origins remained discernible. Narrative approaches emerge, yet they do not connect to a single narrative, but can still be combined freely. The "experience of the provisionality and relativity of all interpretations" (Hanne Loreck) is mirrored in this formal openness.

Belgrave Road

Belgrave Road is a street in the Pimlico area of London. It is situated in the city of Westminster and runs between Eccleston Bridge to the northwest and Lupus Street to the southeast.
The street and the adjacent area were developed by Thomas Cubitt in the 1840s, who considered it as dwellings for the middle class, as opposed to those he had developed in Belgravia for the more affluent. The widths of the properties were comparatively narrow. As a result the area went into decline but has more recently improved in both appearance and use.
There are three green spaces along its length, which is only 750 metres long. These are Eccleston Square, Warwick Square, and St George's Square. 
Belgrave Road is the home of HM Passport Office and two private schools. For the most part, both sides of the road are terraced stucco-fronted houses, giving the street an appearance of elegance from a previous age. Many of these houses have been converted into hotels, some of which have combined three adjacent houses. There are over twenty hotels in a street where the house numbers do not exceed 140. This gives rise to a very mobile population. Except where Warwick Way crosses Belgrave Road, there are no shops, and even at this crossing there is only a small convenience store and a public house, the "Marquis of Westminster".
Its proximity to Victoria Station has made it a popular street for tourists.

Samori Marksman

Samori Tarik Marksman (October 27, 1947 – March 23, 1999) was a journalist, historian, political activist and professor. He was also the Program Director of radio station WBAI, 99.5 FM in New York City. Under his leadership WBAI became to be known as the university of the airwaves—a place for the "news behind the news."
Biography.
He was born Stanley Theodolph Marksman on the island of St. Vincent in the Caribbean to Sybil Providence and Stanley Marksman.
A strong advocate for the oppressed, Marksman’s popular programs "Behind the News" and "World View" on WBAI offered in-depth analyses of the news from a perspective that was largely absent from the mainstream press. He also brought to the radio voices of empowerment such as, Paul Robeson, John Henrik Clarke, Ivan van Sertima, Louis Clayton Jones, Walter Rodney, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Kwame Nkrumah and Stokely Carmichael. 
He adopted the name Samori Tarik Marksman when he became a citizen of Guinea in the 1970s. His work with the Guinean revolution earned him the Croix de Chivalry award. During this period, Marksman also taught at the University of Liberia and the College of West Africa. He served as director of the privately funded African division of the New York-based Pan African Skills Project, which recruited scientist and individuals with technological know-how to teach in Africa. 
On his return to the United States from Africa, Marksman became founder and publisher of the magazine "Caribbean Perspective". He was also a frequent contributor to Covert Action Quarterly and to the "New York Amsterdam News". During the Grenada Revolution (1979—83), he worked as a researcher and publicist for the government of Grenada, and was co-director to the documentary film, "Grenada: The Future Coming Toward Us". Marksman was also professor of journalism at Long Island University in New York City.
Samori Marksman was founder/co-founder of several organizations, including the African and Caribbean Rights Organization, the African Mobilization Committee and the Patrice Lumumba Coalition. These organizations often held community forums throughout the New York City area, but particularly in his beloved “People’s Republic of Brooklyn,” and in Harlem. The forums offered a platform to leaders of liberation struggles, the peace and environmental movements, and human rights activists. 
Samori Marksman died in 1999. He was survived by his wife Rita, and his children Lindiwe, Zindzi, and Kaifa.

Gus Schilling

August "Gus" Schilling (June 20, 1908 – June 16, 1957) was an American film actor. A former burlesque comedian, the New York-born Schilling usually played nervous comic roles, often unbilled.
Career.
Schilling's rubber face and flustered gestures made him a natural comedian, and he began his career understudying comedy stars Bert Lahr and Joe Penner on Broadway. He soon became a favorite among burlesque comedians, who welcomed him into the burlesque profession. Schilling married burlesque star Betty Rowland and the couple toured in the Minsky burlesque troupe.
Orson Welles saw Schilling in New York and followed him to Florida. There Welles hired Schilling to appear in a stage production featuring several Shakespearean scenes. "I learned my part by taking the script to Welles and having him translate the lines to everyday English," Schilling recalled in 1939. Welles promised Schilling a part in Welles's first motion picture, and kept his promise: Schilling is featured in "Citizen Kane" (1941). This established Schilling in Hollywood movies as a "nervous" comedian (he plays a jittery symphony conductor in Olsen and Johnson's "Hellzapoppin"', for example). He also co-starred with character comedian Richard Lane in a series of 11 comedy shorts for Columbia Pictures; the series ran from 1945 to 1950.
Personal life.
In July 1945 Schilling was arrested in Hollywood on charges of possession of narcotics. At his trial he testified that he admitted ownership of the contraband to save his wife from arrest. The all-woman jury acquitted Schilling on November 28.
Schilling's marriage to Betty Rowland ended in divorce. His professional career remained successful, and he worked in movies and television throughout the 1950s. His last film was Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958).
Schilling died of a heart attack on June 16, 1957, four days short of his 49th birthday.

City of Sorcery

City of Sorcery is a fantasy science fiction novel novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley in her Darkover series and is a sequel to "Thendara House". It was originally published by DAW Books (No. 600) in October 1984.
In terms of the Darkover timeline, "City of Sorcery" falls in the era identified by the author as .
Plot Summary.
‘'City of Sorcery’’ begins five years after the end of "Thendara House". The Renunciates and a select group of Terran women who have agreed to abide by Renunciate laws have formed The Bridge Society, to facilitate understanding between the two groups.
Magda Lorne learns from her supervisor, Cholayna Ares, that a Terran operative, Alexis Anders, has survived a plane crash in the Hellers a week earlier. Five days later, she appeared at the spaceport with amnesia. Cholayna believes Anders’ memory has been tampered with and wants Magda to use her laran abilities to help recover her memories. After a bit of telepathic probing, Anders abruptly appears to have recovered, though she remembers nothing of her past week’s ordeal.
Later, in retelling the story to Camilla at the Guildhouse, Magda recalls her three previous experiences with mystical visions of the Dark Sisterhood, and crows, which seem to be their avatars. Camilla tells Magda that the Sisterhood is a secret society; that she and Jaelle were both invited to join, but refused. With Jaelle’s assistance, Magda makes contact with the Forbidden Tower, but they are unable to explain Anders’ experiences.
Rafaella undertakes a travel commission from Alexis Anders, but leaves a note behind for Jaelle. Magda tells Cholayna that Alexis has taken the expedition under false pretenses. Cholayna, Magda, Vanella, Jaelle, and Camilla set out to follow Alexis. The expedition takes them high into the Hellers, through treacherous terrain. Magda goes into the Overworld to ask the advise of the Forbidden Tower, but is confronted by an ancient crone who repeatedly warns her to turn back. Magda refuses.
The Terran women suffer frostbite and altitude sickness, but continue despite their troubles. After about a week, they continue on their way, crossing the Kadarin River, and arrive at the city of Nevarsin. An arrogant "leronis", who calls herself Acquilara, greets them with a great deal of self-importance and bluster. The women are suspicious of her and decide to leave the city. Cholayna’s altitude sickness gets worse, as do the travel conditions.
High in the Hellers, they meet Kyntha, who explains that they have arrived at the holy house of the goddess, Avarra, and offers to care for their injuries. Cholayna takes more than a week to recover. The women who care for them recoil at Acquilara’s name, declaring her evil.
Marisela, a sister from the Thendara guildhouse, known to also be a member of the sisterhood, arrives, having followed their entire journey. She explains that she serves the sisterhood, but is not one of them.
The group continues on in their journey, now seeking in earnest the mysterious city of the sisterhood. As they arrive at a pass that gives them a view of the mountains known as the “wall around the world,” Marisela is killed, apparently by Acquilara. The others fall unconscious and awake in a cave.
Alexa Anders arrives, apparently under the control of Acquilara. She speaks abusively to all of those who have been attempting her rescue. She leads Magda to Acquilara, who turns out to have political agenda and wants to exploit Magda’s connections with the Forbidden Tower. Magda refuses to help.
Magda and the others attempt an escape, but are recaptured. Magda has a vision of Kyntha, who tells her not to hate her captures, that it gives Acquilara entry into their minds. Again, they attempt to escape and find themselves in an all out fight. Jaelle attacks Acquilara, and in the fight, both fall over a cliff and are killed. Alexis is wounded, and also dies.
Kyntha now asks each of the what they seek. Camilla and Magda chooses enter the city of the sisterhood, while the others return to Thendara.

SD Amorebieta

Sociedad Deportiva Amorebieta is a Spanish football team based it Amorebieta-Etxano, in the Basque Country. Founded on 4 January 1925 it currently plays in Segunda División B – Group 2, holding home games at "Campo Municipal de Urritxe", which seats 3,000 spectators (all seated).
History.
Amorebieta was founded in 1925 after the disappearance of "Sociedad Deportiva Beti-Arin" (founded on 2 December 1923). The "Zornotzarra" club, alongside 21 other clubs in Biscay, joined the Biscayan Football Federation.
In the 1926–27 season, the club made an outstanding campaign in his second competitive year. It had as its main rival FBC Durango, who finished in the top position after a tiebreaker match, after both teams totalled 14 points in the season. Despite finishing second, Amorebieta clinched the first promotion of its history, rising one step inside the Biscayan Regional category to play, the next year, in the "Preferente C" division.
In 1962–63, Amorebieta played in the Spanish Amateur Championship semifinals against Real Madrid's farm team, losing 0–2 in Vallecas and managing a 2–2 draw in the second leg, thus being eliminated.
Eighteen years later, the team finished second in "Preferente", and played in a promotion play-off against Mondragón CF, which won 4–3 in the first leg; however, a 2–0 home triumph in the second match promoted, for the second time in its history, the club to the fourth division, where it remained for the following three decades.

1964 United States Embassy in Libreville bombings

The United States Embassy in Libreville, Gabon was bombed on 5 March 1964 and again on 8 March.
Background.
Two weeks before the bombings, Gabon had undergone an abortive coup d'état against its president, Leon M'ba. Following the attempted coup, some Gabonese mistakenly identified the United States as a co-conspirator in the attempted coup. "Time" asserted that French officials helped spread the rumor of American involvement in the coup.
Bombings.
On 5 March, William F. Courtney, deputy chief of the embassy, received a call from a man identifying himself as DuPont and demanding all Americans leave Gabon. Two other phone calls threatening an imminent attack were received by the United States Information Service. During a rainstorm about 8:15 that night, a small bomb exploded outside the embassy. The explosion, which occurred at a time when the building was closed and locked, resulted in damage to the embassy sign and the cracking of two windows. 
Following the bombing, French Gabonese made more threatening phone calls to the embassy. A second bomb exploded roughly 50 feet from the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. William Courtney, the American "chargé d'affaires", noticed two Europeans in a Simca automobile drive past the embassy at roughly 9:20 PM, one hour before the shooting and bombing. An unnamed American official said that he saw a car circle the embassy 10 minutes after the bombing. Two Gabonese policemen were assigned to protect the building, and M'ba ordered an investigation into the bombings. He denounced the allegations against Americans, saying:

Angelus Apatrida

Angelus Apatrida is a thrash metal band formed in 2000 in Albacete, Spain. 
Biography.
Early years (2000-2003).
Angelus Apatrida was formed with a music style much different than what is played today. At the beginning it was a classic heavy metal music / power metal band. Two demos were recorded in this period: "Lost in the Realms of Orchinodaemon" (2001) and "Unknown Human Being" (2003). The last one was a change for the band and was recorded with a new style that led Angelus Apatrida to a post-thrash metal style.
With those demos the band started to play live shows supporting other bands like Saratoga and its popularity soon increased. It won a competition of bands and signed its first contract with the label Red Dragon and recorded the song "Danza de la Muerte" for a tribute album for the Spanish classic heavy metal band called Panzer.
The contract with Red Dragon Records was for three albums. The band recorded the first one, called "Evil Unleashed" in the Korsakov studios in Madrid during the summer of 2004 produced by Kosta Vázquez but it was never released due to problems with the label. Eventually, the band decided to break the contract with Red Dragon and to re-record the album one year later.
"Evil Unleashed" (2003-2006).
The "Evil Unleashed" album was re-recorded in the Studio54 studio in Valencia, produced by Enrique Soriano and mastered by Dave Horrocks in Canada at the Infinite Waves studio. The album was edited by Angelus Apatrida in March, 2006 with Producciones Malditas. It was distributed through K-Industria all over the country.
The album received good reviews and Angelus Apatrida was considered as one of the most sensational new bands of the country. It sold many copies in Spain and other countries.
Angelus Apatrida started its first important tour with the Evil Unleashed Tour through many locations in Spain as well as recognized fests like Thrash Attack fest or Viñarock playing together with international bands like Sepultura or Horcas and supporting others like Warcry or Destruction. 
"Give 'em War" (2007-2008).
After the first album and the Evil Unleashed tour, the band started recording a new album one year later. It recorded the "Give 'em War" album at the New Life studios in Madrid produced by José A. Garrido and Daniel Melian, mastered by Kosta Vázquez at the Oasis studios and distributed by Mastertrax.
The album was faster, darker and more aggressive than the previous one. The band received many good reviews of the album and the band became one of the most representative bands of The New Wave of Spanish Thrash Metal. It sold many copies all over the world in many different countries and started a long tour on September 2007.
The tour included shows all over the country and others in Europe, in many different fests or supporting acts. 
Century Media Records and new album "Clockwork" (2009-2011).
In December 2009, Angelus Apatrida signed a worldwide deal with major label Century Media Records and toured with Swedish metal act Arch Enemy in Spain and Portugal. In January 2010, the band finished the recording sessions of its third album entitled "Clockwork", the first for Century Media, which was recorded at the Portuguese studios Ultrasound with the producer Daniel Cardoso. The album was released on June 21, 2010, and it landed at position No. 44 on the official Spanish chart. On October 28, the band released the music video for "Blast Off", directed and produced by Stuff & Nonsense and directors Adriana Lorente and Sara Cort.
"The Call" and re-release of "Evil Unleashed / Give ‘Em War" (2012-present).
On April 13th, 2012, Angelus Apatrida released their 4th studio album titled "The Call" and produced by Daniel Cardoso. Angelus Apatrida had previously checked in to comment about the new album’s opening song “You Are Next” and the material on “The Call” as follows: “We think that 'The Call' is a record that represents the wide variety of styles and elements in our music extremely well; every song stands alone strong and unique in its own way, making the album a whole piece that needs to be heard completely to get the full idea of the sound of the band. But, if we had to choose one song to represent the whole thing, it would be 'You Are Next' because, both lyrical and musically, it showcases the anger and fury we wanted to put into this album, and also reflects the step forward we feel we have made technically. It's a song that starts slowly and trying to capture the listener before exploding into a furious sonic assault." "The Call" entered the official chart in the band's home country, Spain, at position No. 14. This marked Century Media Records' highest-ever chart entry in that country.
On September 18th, 2013, Angelus Apatrida announced their next European tour in November-December together with Havok and Savage Messiah, supporting their upcoming re-release of the band’s first two albums as double-disc set entitled "Evil Unleashed / Give ‘Em War", out in Europe via Century Media Records on November 18th, 2013. This marks the first time that their first two albums, "Evil Unleashed" (2006) and "Give 'Em War" (2007), are properly made available outside of the band’s home territory of Spain. The re-release will gather both albums onto a 2CD package entitled adding new layouts, liner notes and plenty of pre-production demo-tracks as special bonus. The creative team involved with this special re-release is the same as on the latest two Angelus Apatrida albums, ”Clockwork” (2010) and “The Call” (2012): Daniel Cardoso handled re-mastering duties for the material and Gustavo Sazes / Abstrata (Arch Enemy, Firewind, Dream Evil, etc.) revamped the artwork.

The band was formed around 1988/1989, from members Robert Cufaro and Alessandro Nunziati. Later on Emiliano Chiocchiolini and Marco Montagna join the band. The proposals are clear: Sepolcrum wants to play death metal as it is meant to be in the early 90's (what is actually known as "old school" death metal). The band's background moves from Massacre to Obituary, from Death to Bolt Thrower, from Entombed to Napalm Death, and is one of the first death metal acts from Rome, Italy. Together with Catacomb (now Novembre), Defunctis, Desecration, they set the basis for the Capital's death metal scene.
Emiliano feels quite out of place due to his mainly rock influences, and is replaced by the massive and hevy drummer Giovanni Casponi, who stays in the band just for a while. Enough though to record the first demo "Anteroom of the Hell", out in December 1991, and begin the Sepolcrum live sessions.
1993 sees the return of Emiliano on the drums, while the band greets the new wave of death/doom, ruled by My Dying Bride and Paradise Lost. In "Flowers Upon The Grave", besides Emiliano also a second guitar player Arrigo Scenna joins the crew for the recording of the second demo and further liveshows. 
In the meanwhile vocalist Alessandro starts thinking about his personal projects, gaining major influences from the black metal/vampire scene.
1994 sees the departure of Emiliano from the band, and the arrival of young Marco De Pascale which stays in the band just for the recording of another demo with 2 songs, leaving later for Enthrallment. 
After the Promo 1994, the band writes down the material (3 songs, one unreleased) to be recorded on the 7" titled "Gather My Blood Forever". Just when the 7" is about to be released, the band changes its name to VII Arcano. So the 7" can actually be considered as the last effort from Sepolcrum.
After the 7" vocalist Alessandro (aka Lord Vampyr) leaves definitely to give full attention to his project Theatres des Vampires", which also involves Robert Cufaro, and the band switches definitely genre to what is the actual VII Arcano.
December 2011 will be 20 years from the first "Anteroom Of The Hell" demo release, rumors say something cool's gonna happen but still no hint about it.

The Balance

"The Balance" is the closing track of The Moody Blues 1970 album "A Question of Balance". Written jointly by band members Graeme Edge and Ray Thomas, "The Balance" describes the balance reference in the album's title. The album's opening track, "Question" is primarily about the negative feelings and attitude toward the Vietnam War, and "The Balance" closes the album by describing the balance that should be achieved. The song's final line, "He saw his enemies like unto himself, and he learned love. Then, he was answered.", alludes to forgiveness of enemies and loving all, which essentially is "The Balance."
The song's verses are spoken (by Mike Pinder) rather than sung while the refrain was sung.

When Bourne is ambushed and badly wounded, he fakes his death and goes into hiding. In safety, he takes on a new identity, and begins a mission to find out who tried to assassinate him. Jason begins to question who he really is, how much of him is tied up in the Bourne identity, and what he would become if that was suddenly taken away from him. Shortly after, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt by an Iranian missile. A global investigative team, led by Soraya Moore, is assembled to get at the truth of the situation before it can escalate into an international scandal. The trail to Bourne's leads him to Seville. On the way there, he meets Tracy Atherton, who tells him that she is going to Seville to buy the 14th Black Painting. In Seville, Bourne is attacked in a bullfighting arena by a killer named The Torturer. Later on, search for the man who shot him intersects with the search for the people that brought down the airliner, leading Bourne into one of the most deadly and challenging situations he has ever encountered. With the threat of a new world war brewing, Bourne finds himself in a race against time to uncover the truth and find the person behind his assault, all the while stalked by his unknown nemesis.

Albany Cottage Hospital

Albany Cottage Hospital is the heritage site of a former hospital in Albany, Western Australia. The site is also named the Vancouver Arts Centre Group for its later use as a community arts centre.
Description.
The buildings and grounds are situated on Vancouver Street, Albany, on a site that overlooks the Princess Royal Harbour. The main building is constructed from local limestone, with a roof of split Jarrah shingles.
The hospital was completed in 1897, from the 1886 design of George Temple-Poole, and continued to operate until 1962.
Heritage value.
This work by Poole was the first of his many public buildings in the state, and a significant departure in architectural style for the Public Works Department. The design followed a contemporary movement of architects, such as Edwin Lutyens, that drew influence from the English cottage. The work is identified as Federation Arts and Crafts, and as an "aesthetically exceptional example" of the architect's work. Other nineteenth century buildings on the site, such as the former nurses quarters, morgue, and carpenters workshop, are regarded as significant as an intact hospital complex. It is the oldest remaining hospital of the historic township. The views of the harbour make this a significant landmark.

Einsatzkommando Finnland

Einsatzkommando Finnland was a German paramilitary unit active in northern Finland and northern Norway during World War II, while Finland was fighting the Continuation War against the Soviet Union with the support of Nazi Germany. The official name of the unit was "Einsatzkommando der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD beim AOK Norwegen, Befehlsstelle Finnland", but it was often referred to as Einsatzkommando Finnland.
The existence of Einsatzkommando Finnland, until then unknown, was revealed in a 2008 doctoral dissertation by Oula Silvennoinen. The unit was subordinated to Reichssicherheitshauptamt, and Finnish security police Valpo as well as a Finnish military intelligence organization collaborated with it.
Background.
It has previously been revealed in several studies, including that of investigative journalist Elina Sana in her book "Luovutetut. Suomen ihmisluovutukset Gestapolle" (""The Extradited. Finland's Extraditions to the Gestapo""), that during the Continuation War roughly 3,000 POWs and civilians were extradited to Germany in exchange for Finno-Ugric Soviet POWs held by Germany. Sana's book led to the ongoing research project at the Finnish National Archives. Most of those extradited joined the Russian Liberation Army or were recruited to spy behind the Soviet lines, but 520 of them were political officers in the Red Army or otherwise active communists, and although they were presumed killed in German hands, their exact fates had been unknown.
Research.
According to Silvennoinen's research, before and during the Continuation War Finland handed over about 500 POWs and refugees to Germans operating in Northern Finland and Northern Norway, who probably executed all of them. About 10% of those handed over were Jewish, although their ethnicity seems not to have been the reason for their extradition. Extraditions began already in the summer of 1940. Additionally, a small number of Valpo officials worked as interpreters and interrogators in German POW camps with German Einsatzkommando Finnland officials, and were complicit in the executions of an unknown number of POWs.
Einsatzkommando Finnland operated in two POW camps, Stalag 322 in Elvenes, Norway and Stalag 309 in Salla, Finland (nowadays Russia). As the German advance into the Soviet Union stalled, the stream of POWs into these camps trickled, and Einsatzkommando Finnland was disbanded at the end of 1942.
Silvennoinen is a researcher at the Finnish National Archives, and his dissertation forms a part of ongoing research on prisoner-of-war deaths in Finland and people handed over to Germany and the Soviet Union by Finnish authorities between 1939 and 1955.

Live Earth (2007 concert)

Live Earth is an annual event developed to combat climate change. The first series of benefit concerts were held on July 7, 2007. The concerts brought together more than 150 musical acts in eleven locations around the world which were broadcast to a mass global audience through televisions, radio, and streamed via the Internet.
Overview.
The umbrella organization for the event was Save Our Selves, founded by Kevin Wall (Executive Producer), and included major partners such as former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, the Alliance for Climate Protection, Earthlab, MSN, and Control Room, the production company which produced the event. The logo for the event was the Morse code distress signal. Brand Neutral, the environmental business strategy firm, served as the worldwide sustainability strategy and services partner for Live Earth, developing the overall sustainability strategy, staffing all members of the global "green team," creating the overall master plan for resource management, and supervising the execution of the Live Earth environmental strategy. Leading sustainability expert John Picard served as chief environmental and efficiency counsellor for the event. The worldwide producer of talent and venue programming for all of the events was Aaron Grosky. The worldwide producer of events was Lily Sobhani. Live Earth produced 60 short films, directed by leading filmmakers from the worlds of films, music videos, commercials and animation. The worldwide producer of Live Earth films was Kit Hawkins. The 22-hour global TV broadcast (world feed) and satellite distribution, as well as radio, internet and mobile production was overseen by Executive in Charge of Production André Mika and produced and directed by Paul Flattery. Ryan Polito also directed the world-wide feed. Unlike the similar Live 8 concerts, which were free, Live Earth charged admission but the event was made broadly available via television and the Internet.
The 2007 event set a new record for on-line entertainment with over 15 million video streams during the live concert alone. Television ratings were mixed, with 41% of households in Canada watching the concerts, while figures in the UK were characterized as a "flop". Television ratings in the United States were "dismal" as well; NBC's broadcast of Live Earth was the least watched network program between the Big Four Television Networks. On the other hand, Bravo, an NBC Universal property, reported the highest Saturday ratings in the network's history Live Earth also performed very well on television ratings in Brazil, reaching 37% of households via Rede Globo, and in Germany, reaching 20% of households through the N24 broadcast.
Background.
The plans for the Live Earth concerts were announced at a media event in Los Angeles on 15 February 2007 by Al Gore, Kevin Wall and other celebrities. The inspiration for promoting the cause using benefit concerts comes from many similar events over the past 25 years including the 1985 Live Aid concerts and the 2005 Live 8 concerts and it was to be the longest show ever to be recorded in the world records. The event was claimed to be carbon neutral, and organisers said they would purchase carbon credits to offset the environmental impact of the flights associated with the events.
In addition to raising awareness of global warming, on 28 June 2007, it was revealed that Live Earth is to be the launch event for the "Live Earth Call to Action". During the concerts people were asked to support the following 7-point pledge:
In subsequent interviews Al Gore indicated that the concerts would mark 'the beginning of a three-year campaign worldwide to deliver information about how we solve the climate crisis' and that 'the prospects for every future generation depend on us understanding, hearing and acting upon this information.'
Live Earth's supporters included climate change activists in New Zealand's Climaction Coalition, who praised concert organisers, stating "Climate change is the greatest threat facing humanity today." Climaction spokesperson David Colyer said the concert presented "a great opportunity to join our voices with theirs" and called on people who could not attend a concert to participate in local events to raise awareness about climate change.
Further information on the issues raised by the concerts are published in "The Live Earth Global Warming Survival Handbook", written by environmentalist David Mayer de Rothschild. Profits from the book will be donated to the Alliance for Climate Protection, as will some of the profits from the concerts.
Antecedents for the style of concerts.
The concert series followed in the tradition of many benefit events staged in the past three decades:
The deployment of multiple pop and rock musicians and entertainers to promote awareness of a single cause has many antecedents - the principal examples being:
Locations.
The organizers intended to present concerts on all seven continents. They stated that the venues would use on-site power generation, efficient methods of energy utilisation and sustainable facilities management in an effort to minimise environmental impact.
The South African concert, originally scheduled for the Cradle of Mankind, was abandoned by local promoter Big Concerts, due to poor ticket sales statistics, believed to be a result of the non-central nature of this landmark and poor planning by the promoter. The Coca-Cola Dome was settled on two days prior to the concert starting.
Washington D.C. venue.
It was only hours before the Washington D.C. concert was scheduled to begin that organisers were able to secure a venue for the last-minute addition to the schedule. "The Washington Post" reported the U.S. capital had been Gore's first choice for the main concert. However, the main concert was moved to New Jersey and Gore made a surprise announcement during a 6 July media interview that a concert would take place on the plaza of the Museum of the American Indian. "Some who don't understand what is now at stake tried to stop this event on the Mall, but here we are. is cheering And it wasn't the cavalry who came to our rescue, it was the American Indians," Gore said during brief opening remarks carried live on the MSN website.

The concerts were broadcast in over 130 countries by more than 500 media partners including television, radio, Internet and wireless channels. National television viewing figures included 19 million viewers in the US, 41% of all households in Canada, 37% of all households in Brazil, and 20% in Germany.
The event also attracted a record on-line audience. Live coverage attracted over 8 million people who watched over 15 million video streams, while total 55 million video streams had been watched by 23 July.
United Kingdom.
London's Wembley Stadium production of "Live Earth," received poor viewing figures on the BBC, blamed on a good weather Saturday afternoon, in addition to the network's tennis coverage at Wimbledon. BBC's live afternoon coverage of the concert drew an average of about 900,000 viewers while the evening viewing figures averaged around 3.1 million and the highlight figures, near the end of the concert, were around 4.5 million. Three times as many viewers had watched the Concert for Diana six days earlier and 9.6 million viewers had watched the Live 8 concert, two years earlier.
Controversies and criticism.
While garnering favorable comments, several aspects of the event drew criticism from various perspectives.
Political motives and campaigning.
Some Republicans criticized Al Gore for organising the event and said he did so to promote himself for a 2008 U.S. Presidential election bid, although Gore has said repeatedly he is "not planning to be a candidate again for office"
and has said that he "had fallen out of love with politics."
Gore did not declare himself as a candidate for either of the 2008 presidential primaries.
Environmental impact.
Bands including The Who, Muse and Arctic Monkeys dubbed Live Earth "Private Jets for Climate Change." The event's total carbon footprint, including the artists' and spectators' travel and energy consumption, was probably at least 74,500 tonnes, according to John Buckley of CarbonFootPrint.com - more than 3,000 times the average Briton's annual footprint. Performers flew at least 222,623.63 miles (about 358,278 kilometres) — the equivalent of nearly nine times round the planet — to take part in the event, and this figure does not include transport of technicians, dancers and support staff. An estimate reported that 100,000 planted trees are required to offset total carbon emissions produced during the entire event, as well as a key sponsor for the event being Chevrolet, promoting a new hybrid four-wheel drive.
The BBC cancelled a later major attempt to "raise consciousness" of global climate change. The BBC's news story suggested that this was in part because "poor ratings in the UK and elsewhere for July's Live Earth concert may have confirmed the internal belief that the public do not like being "lectured to" on climate change." 
DaimlerChrysler used its low-emissions "Smart" car brand while sponsoring the event worldwide.
Concert-goers at the event’s London leg had left thousands of plastic cups on the floor of Wembley Stadium, although organisers had urged audience members to use the recycling bins provided, the BBC reported.
Al Gore was unhappy with the travel arrangements of the UK band Razorlight. After their appearance at the London Live Earth event, they were ferried to an airport in a large tour bus with a police escort to catch a private jet to Scotland. From the airport in Scotland they travelled by helicopter to Balado to perform at T in the Park. Razorlight claimed they would offset their emissions by planting trees.
Singer-songwriter John Mayer, one of the big attractions at the New Jersey/New York concert had not signed Gore's seven-point Live Earth pledge. "If you want to peg me as not being entirely eco-friendly, you'll win," Mayer told reporters after his set. "We're just getting together saying 'We want to be healthier'.” 
Bob Geldof and Live 8.
Before the goals of the concerts were announced on June 28, the concert was criticised by Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof and Roger Daltrey of The Who about a lack of a final goal. Geldof said in an interview on 15 May 2007, that the concerts are a waste of time because "Everybody's known about warming for years." Geldof said he would organise a concert like Live Earth only if he "could go on stage and announce concrete environmental measures from the American presidential candidates, Congress, or major corporations." Daltrey said "The last thing the planet needs is a rock concert ... the questions and the answers are so huge I don't know what a rock concert's ever going to do to help."
A spokesman for Live Earth responded to Geldof, saying that the concerts were intended to raise awareness about the dangers of climate change. "People are aware of global warming but millions are not doing anything about changing their lifestyles." Al Gore said "What Bob Geldof did with Live Aid and Live 8 was fantastic and he has followed up very diligently. has said ... how important it is to have specific goals and a continuing follow-on effort, and we have designed the Live Earth concerts in just that way." Gore continued, “This one day, 24 hours long, will not only be a wake-up call for the world but the beginning of a multi-year campaign to organize an effective response to the climate crisis.” 
BBC coverage of the London venue.
The BBC which televised the concert in Britain received a total of 413 complaints because coverage of Metallica's live set was cut short, and approximately 130 complaints concerning swearing as the BBC had shown the concert before the watershed time of 9pm, this includes Chris Rock jokingly calling the crowd "motherfuckers". The BBC later apologised for cutting away from footage of Metallica, and both during and after the concert for the bad language. On 12 April 2008, an Ofcom broadcast was shown on BBC1, apologising again for the 'offensive language.'
Financial lack of transparency.
Intelligent Giving have attempted to find out what was happening to the proceeds from ticket sales at the concerts. Their conclusions, published in a feature "What on (Live) Earth is going on?" were that no one involved is capable of giving a clear answer.
Home release.
Live Earth was documented on "Live Earth: The Concerts for a Climate in Crisis", released on November 26 internationally and December 4 in the U.S (DVD 780.97 L) by Warner Bros. Records. Featuring one CD and two DVDs, the set featured footage from the London, New York and Tokyo concerts, six of the short films from the project, and a making of documentary of the concerts. Proceeds from the CD/DVD were directed to the Alliance for Climate Protection.

Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople

Alexius Studites (), Patriarch of Constantinople, was a member of the Monastery of Stoudios (founded 462), succeeded Eustathius as Patriarch in 1025, the last of the Patriarchs appointed by the emperor Basil II.
Patriarchate.
Alexius set out to reform the church institution of the "charistike". The institution of the "charistike dorea" (donation), which recent research dates to the period just after the restoration of Orthodoxy (843). Effectively, it involved the donation of monasteries to private individuals unrelated to the establishments founders, for a limited period of time. Ostensibly undertaken so that the monastery buildings could be repaired or conserved and the estate out to good use, while at the same time protecting and preserving its spiritual functions, in actuality it was widely abused by the landed gentry and so became a source of abused patronage by high church officials and a tool against the powerful monastic establishment. Alexius tried to temper the worst abused of the notorious "charistike" by appointing through Synodal legislation the patriarch's chancellor, the "chartophylax", as the official to serve as the final point of approval for all grants under the system. Alexius also restricted the granting of "charistike" to non-dioceesan monasteries. The fact that Alexius sought reform over abolishment of the "charistike dorea" likely shows the inability of the Church to claim back many of these properties from the powerful land-owning elite who held them.
He promoted the zealous actions of John of Melitene whose interest it was to limit the influence of the Syro Jacobite Church in the south east of the Byzantine Empire, especially in the newly conquered themes of Mesopotamia and Telouch. For this reason the Syro-Jacobite Patriarch John VIII bar Abdoun was arrested and brought to trial in Constantinople and then forced into a monastery on Mt. Ganos. In 1034 he crowned Michael IV the Paphlagonian, the favorite of Byzantine empress Zoë, who, to make way for him, procured the death of her husband, the Emperor Romanos III Argyros. He thwarted the attempts of John the Orphanotrophos (the emperor's brother) to gain the patriarchal see in 1036, and died in 1043.
Typikon.
Alexios Studites also established a monastery for which he wrote the rule ("typikon") which was then used as the rule for the Kiev Monastery of the Caves.
Decrees of his are still extant. He is noted for the elevated style employed in the numerous decrees of his which have survived.
Synod decrees.
The synod decrees are unusual for their number and the fact they are dated precisely.

<doc id="19417050" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19417050" title="Christoph Sauer">
Christoph Sauer

Christoph Sauer (1695-September 25, 1758) was the first German-language printer and publisher in North America.
Johann Christoph Sauer was born in 1695 in Ladenburg (near Heidelberg), the son of a Reformed pastor. He came to the County ("Graftschaft") of Wittgenstein in central Germany as a child with his widowed mother some time between 1700-1710. At the time, its rulers were tolerant of a variety of Pietists and other religious dissenters, most notably Alexander Mack, who would later found the Church of the Brethren in the United States. He had married the widowed Maria Christina (born Gruber) in 1720. The family lived in the village of Schwarzenau, which now belongs to the town of Berleburg though had ties to Laasphe as well.
They emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1724, settling in Germantown. Sauer worked as a tailor before moving in 1726 to Lancaster where he had a farm. Within a few years, his wife had joined the Ephrata Cloister as "Sister Marcella", leaving Sauer to care for their young son (she returned to the family around 1744). He and his son of the same name returned to Germantown where he worked in a variety of trades and belonged to the Dunkard community. He was successful enough to purchase where he built a house.
Around 1735, Sauer took up the idea of becoming a printer and publisher. Benjamin Franklin dominated this trade at the time, and was a supplier of printed materials to the large German community around Pennsylvania. Significantly, Franklin used only Roman typefaces. Sauer obtained Fraktur type from a foundry in Frankfurt/Main in 1738 and began to publish almanacs, calendars, books and newspapers in 1739 using a type face that his German readers could more easily read.
The press itself is believed to have come from Berleburg in Wittgenstein, with which he had remained in contact. It had been used by Pietist printers there.
In 1743, Sauer published the first German-language Bible to be printed in North America (the first in any European language). The 1,272 pages were of course hand-set and printed one sheet at a time. It bore the title ""Biblia, Das ist: Die Heilige Schrift Alten und Neuen Testaments, Nach der Deutschen Übersetzung D. Martin Luther"". (Bible: The Holy Scripture of the Old and New Testaments following the translation of Dr. Martin Luther). 1200 copies were printed. Another 40 years would pass before an English-language Bible would appear in North America.
Controversially, Sauer's Bible emphasized passages most in sympathy with Pietist beliefs. It was well received by the German churches of Pennsylvania, who were in turn influential in what became the Universalist church in the Middle Atlantic and New England states. George de Benneville (1703–1793) was an important influence on the early Universalists and, like Sauer, had sojourned among the Wittgenstein Pietists before coming to America.
Sauer remained active as a printer up until his death on September 25, 1758 in Germantown, but none of his other publications had the impact of the "Sauer Bible." The latter was re-published in 1763 and again in 1776 by his son.

<doc id="19417078" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19417078" title="Reflective writing">
Reflective writing

Reflective writing is a practice in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, form, adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the item or incident, thought, feeling, emotion, or situation in his or her life. Many reflective writers keep in mind questions, such as "What did I notice?" "How has this changed me?" or "What might I have done differently?"
Thus, the focus is on writing that is not merely descriptive. The writer doesn’t just hit the replay button; rather, he or she revisits the scene to note details and emotions, reflect on meaning, examine what went well or revealed a need for additional learning, and relate what transpired to the rest of life.
Uses.
While anyone can use reflective writing for personal development, the practice is often incorporated into professionalism training for physicians, nurses, teachers, social workers, and others needing to offer more humane and compassionate service to their patients or clients. The underlying assumption is that through the experience of telling and listening to stories, the student becomes more attuned to noticing, listening to, recording, and responding to the stories of patients and colleagues in years to come.
Through the longitudinal practice of reflective writing comes recognition that people's perspectives grow and change. A vector develops: the stories are going somewhere, or they are stuck. Viewed this way, even bad days are not so awful; the writer becomes curious about what comes next. The mindful, reflective stance that develops in clinical training can subsequently be helpful and healing when modeled for patients or clients.
Reflective writing asks the practitioner not only to pull back the lens and observe events, human interactions, and perspectives in the field of study, but also to become more conscious of his/her emotional responses to situations encountered in training and practice, to find metaphors for experiences, and to contextualize observations. When reflective writing is shared in classes and groups, careful listening and provision of responsible, sensitive feedback to fellow students and practitioners is encouraged.

Black (turkey)

The Black, sometimes referred to as the Black Spanish or the Norfolk Black, is a breed of domestic turkey. The Black was developed in Europe from the Aztec turkeys originally brought from Mexico by Spanish explorers. Despite the monikers of “Spanish and “Norfolk” (England), birds of this type live in many European nations. Originally, black colored turkeys were a relative rarity among New World flocks, but Europeans heavily selected for this trait until it became predominant.
The "Norfolk Black" is generally considered the oldest turkey breed in the UK
Black turkeys were sent in the holds of ships on the transatlantic crossing from Europe to the New World, and were raised by early colonists. Ironically, it is likely that the turkey consumed at the first Thanksgiving meal may have actually been from European birds, rather than Wild Turkeys native to the continent, though these descended from said bird.
Later, Blacks were crossed with the Wild Turkey to help produce breeds such as the Bronze, Narragansett, and Slate. They remained a commercially farmed variety in the U.S. until the early 20th century, but fell out of favor after the development of the Broad Breasted Bronze and Broad Breasted White. Fairly common in Europe, they are considered an endangered variety of heritage turkey today by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, and are also included in Slow Food USA's Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction.

Cirrhigaleus australis

Cirrhigaleus australis, also known as the Southern Mandarin Dogfish, is a species of Mandarin dogfish shark in the genus "Cirrhigaleus". It was distinguished from "Cirrhigaleus barbifer", which lives in the North Pacific, on an expedition in the coral reefs near Australia in 2007. It is now known to live in the temperate waters east of Australia and possibly around New Zealand, at depths of 146–640 metres.
Physical characteristics.
C. australis is medium-sized and robust compared to other dogfish. It is grey-brown above and pale below. The posterior margins of the pectoral and pelvic fins are white. This species of shark normally grow less than a metre long, but have been known to reach 1.25 metres. C. australis has smaller eyes, pectoral fins, dorsal fins, and spine than its cousin. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized and slightly raked. The second is similarly shaped, but a bit smaller. The pectoral fins are fairly large. Both dorsal spines are long. It also has strangely long barbels, giving it the name "Mandarin". There are about 115 centra along the back.
Scientists say the shark is harmless. Its defensive techniques are useless against many larger fish, and, as a consequence, it is very vulnerable to other sharks and fish. Also, C. australis has very low resilience, its population doubling only about every 14 years.
Expedition.
In 2007, a group of scientists from CSIRO spent some time searching the Eastern coast of Australia for new species. Along with the newly distinguished Cirrhigaleus australis, several hundreds of new marine species were discovered. Included were skates, sea stars, corals, bivalves, brachiopods, several types of marine arthropods, and many others.
They conducted research in three outings, each three weeks long. Two outings were in the Great Barrier Reef on Lizard Island and Heron Island, and the third was in the Ningaloo Reef on the northwest coast of Australia. In the Ningaloo Reef, many species were discovered, but no specimens of "Cirrhigaleus australis" were found. The expedition was a great success, and Australia now has more information on the marine flora and fauna that dominate their coral reefs.

And the Tide Rushes In

"And the Tide Rushes In" is a song from The Moody Blues 1970 album "A Question of Balance". Written by band member Ray Thomas, "And the Tide Rushes In" connotes a sense of strife in a relationship with the narrator's lover symbolized as the tide, rushing in and washing the narrator's efforts away. The first verse conveys the discord: "I build them up/You knock them down." In the second verse, the narrator listens to his lover, yet acknowledges the complaints are the same ones always being offered: "I hear nothing new." The song's conclusion does not suggest a happy ending. The blackbird mentioned will continue to watch the events of the lovers' lives, but there's nothing to suggest the lovers will do anything different in their lives than what they've done up to this point. Acorns will grow into trees, but that's the only change the ending suggests.
Ray Thomas reportedly wrote the song after a row with his wife.

Dreaming Metal is a 1997 science fiction novel by Melissa Scott that explores the question of when does artificial intelligence become indistinguishable from human intelligence. Another important theme to the book is the impact of terrorism on the lives of people and how artists react to this. With its focus on technology and tensions between social classes, this book is an example of the cyberpunk genre.
Characters.
Celeste is an artificial intelligence. One component was originally owned by Reverdy Jian. A second component was added by Celinde Fortune, who needs a computer assistant to operate the karakuri (lifelike manikins) for her act.
Celinde Fortune is an illusionist who uses lifelike manikins as part of her act to deliberately blur the line between "human" and "robot", "real" and "artificial".
Reverdy Jian, female spaceship pilot, is a main character from "Dreamships" where Ms. Scott establishes the political conflicts between those who advocate rights for artificial intelligences and those who view them as property. Her co-pilot, Imre Vaughn, is in a gay partnership with Red, who had a relationship with Fanning Jones in the past.
Fanning Jones is a cousin of Celinde Fortune and member of a band that comes to perform at the same theatre as Fortune. The band is controversial because it includes members from two social classes. Fanning programs the visual effects for the band. He has the contacts that enable Fortune to purchase the components that become Celeste.

The Mole (Australia season 5)

The fifth season of the Australian version of The Mole, subtitled "The Amazing Game", took place in New Zealand and was hosted by Tom Williams.
Show Details.
The announced maximum kitty for the season was $500,000, though the absolute maximum was slightly more than that. The final group kitty was $203,000. This season featured a slightly different format from other seasons, in that the challenges took place over a weekend in New Zealand, and afterward, the players were flown in to a studio in Sydney for a live quiz and elimination. This also meant that the seclusion of the players, normally a standard feature of "The Mole", was broken, as the players were able to talk to friends and family while in Sydney, watch the produced episode, and even check the internet for clues.
Additionally, it was revealed at the beginning of the series that if the Mole went unidentified over the course of the series, they would win all the money that was kept from the kitty.
There was no 2004 season due to poor ratings from the third and fourth seasons but the show was revived in 2005 with the hope that ratings would again return. Poor ratings for this season meant that there have since been no further seasons in Australia until 2013.
Williams was brought on to host the show because popular previous host Grant Bowler was unavailable due to a prior commitment. Episodes were broadcast on Thursday nights (thus partially directly going head to head with a behind-the-scenes edition of "Australian Idol") and the PG rating was brought back due to the show airing at 7:30pm. In the first episode, as the elimination process was about to start, one of the production assistants accidentally yelled out: "It's Josh!" (in reference to the contestant who was about to be eliminated). Luckily, the contestants didn't hear those words. Some eliminated contestants would appear on "Sunrise" the morning after their elimination.
It was also notable for being sponsored by the then new PlayStation Portable, which each contestant receiving instructions and challenges by way of a memory card and on-screen displays.
The winner of The Mole, Liz Cantor, has since become a fill-in weather presenter on "Seven News Brisbane".

Episodes.
Episode 1.
Avalanche: The players met up for the first time on a snowy mountaintop in Queenstown, New Zealand. They were split into three groups of four and were given thirty minutes to find three avalanche beacons that had been hidden in the snow, to the north, east, and west of their starting position. Each group was given shovels and a receiver that would beep if it was within 40 meters of the beacon. The groups sent to the north and to the east found what they were looking for quickly - the group sent to the north found the beacon itself, while the group sent to the east found a locked black case. Upon returning to the starting position, they found that the north group's beacon had a dogtag on it that revealed the combination to one of the locks. Kristy, Heidi, Sonya, and John, sent to the west, initially went in the wrong direction and returned with their beacon with mere seconds on the clock. The group unlocked the black case in time, but what they found inside it was a second locked case. The host revealed that he had the key to that case, and to obtain it, nine of the players would have to spend the night in a snow cave. The three who were spared were Liz, Heidi, and Kristy. The other nine were told that if anyone asked to leave the snow cave, they could, but the money for the challenge would then be lost. All nine of them stayed the night in the snow cave, and the $25,000 was won.
Rungway: The players met up at the bottom of a hill with rungs attached to it. They were told to split into two groups of six, one group who would take an easier climb to the top of the hill, and one who would take a harder climb. Along both climbs were several envelopes with letters in them, to be used as part of an anagram puzzle on a board at the bottom of the hill. There were clues, of increasing obviousness, on the board that could be uncovered for $5,000, $10,000, and $15,000 from the kitty. They were told to retrieve the envelopes and not open them till they were back at the bottom of the hill, and to not unhook their carabiners from the line, or incur a $5,000 penalty. The group doing the easy climb followed the directions and retrieved their letters quickly, but the group doing the hard climb all climbed up the hill right past the letters and had to go back down to retrieve them, back up to the top again, and then finally back down to the bottom of the hill. After the group bought the $5,000 clue, "He is still alive," Liane from the team doing the easily climb solved the anagram before the team that had done the hard climb even returned to the starting position, getting the answer of Edmund Hillary. Along with the $5,000 price of the clue, Liz was revealed to have unhooked her carabiner on the hill, costing another $5,000.
Episode 2.
Counting: The players met up at a farm at the foot of a mountain in the Southern Alps and split into three groups. Each group's task involved counting – one group had to count sheep, another needles in a haystack, and another baby chicks. Each team needed to get their count exactly right to win the challenge, and each wrong guess cost $1,000 from the kitty. The sheep team's first guess of 599 sheep was correct. The chick team first guessed 596, 601, and 600 before giving their correct answer, which was also 599. Upon reuniting with the host in a cabin, the two teams learned that there were 599 needles in the haystack that the other players had to count. The host radioed them and told them that if they would simply guess whether there were more or less than 600 needles in the haystack, they could quit counting and come inside. This guess would be worth $10,000 if correct, and would take away $10,000 if incorrect. After submitting a guess that there were 176 needles in the haystack, they decided to gamble and correctly guessed that there were less than 600 needles in the haystack, winning $6,000 (after penalties for wrong guesses).
Christchurch: After being chosen by the group as their two worst chess players, Heidi and Nat were told to cycle to the top of a hill in Christchurch, in a race against the other nine. The road they were to take was 9 kilometers in length, and after 6 kilometers, they met up with the host who offered them, for a penalty of $5,000 from the kitty, a ride in a helicopter to the top of the hill, which would likely ensure their victory. They refused this offer and continued cycling. The other nine players were to take a gondola lift to the top, which would take about ten minutes to ride, but had to first earn their tickets, needing to win an outdoor game of chess with oversized pieces against an eleven-year old schoolgirl. If Heidi and Nat arrived at the top first, they would gain free passes to the next episode and no money would be won, but if the group of nine arrived first, they would win $25,000. Arriving at the board, the group of nine found that three of their pieces, the queen, a bishop, and a pawn, were missing and said to be in "obvious places." They found the queen in a park called Victoria Square, the bishop in a nearby church, and the pawn in a pawn shop. Craig and Brett did most of the work on the chessboard, and in fact lost the first game. They won the second, but upon arriving at the top of the hill after the gondola ride, they found that Heidi and Nat had arrived first, won exemptions, and denied the group any money.
Episode 3.
Crayfish: After rowing a waka out to a large boat to meet the host, the players were instructed to dive for three pots, each of which contained ten crayfish. One pot was a meter below the surface, the second was two meters below, and the third four meters below. They were to split into duos, who would each have three minutes in the water, and each crayfish successfully retrieved would add $500 to the kitty. Brett and Liz each retrieved two crays and the others aside from Liane each got one, for a total of eleven and $5,500. The host rounded this up to $6,000 after the challenge concluded.
Māori Waka: The players were told to paddle the Māori waka, that they had earlier paddled out to the large boat, back to the beach, and were given a minute for each crayfish they retrieved. This was worth $10,000, but they finished in thirteen and a half minutes and won nothing.
Hostage Rescue: John and Liane were taken hostage by masked men and dumped in a nondescript room well away from the team's hotel. The other eight were told to find them within two hours to win $25,000. They had at their disposal three means of transport - a car, a helicopter, and a boat. All three teams needed to be present to free the hostages. Each of the groups was given an intermediate destination where they would find a clue, which was a key and a mobile phone attached to a buoy. Each key opened one of three locks on the hostages' cell. Once the groups found their mobiles, they were able to contact John and Liane, who figured out that they were in a police station, and based on a clue that they found in their cell, figured out that they were in the town of Russell, New Zealand. The helicopter and boat teams arrived at the hostages' cell in plenty of time, but the car team of Juan, Liz, and Kristy did not immediately take off from the starting position and were too far away by road to make it to the hostages in time when all was figured out. However, the boat cut across a bay and was able to bring them to the cell just before time ran out, winning the $25,000.
Episode 4.
Election: On the plane trip back, the players were informed that New Zealand was shortly to have a national election and that their next assignment was to land in Wellington, New Zealand's capital, to obtain 100 signatures of New Zealanders on a petition stating that New Zealand should give up its independence and become the seventh state of Australia. They split into three groups, with each using a different means to get the word out. After their advertisements had been out for a short while, each group was given two hours in downtown Wellington to actually collect, among them all, the 100 signatures. They were told that each person must know precisely what they were signing if the signature was to count. The host waited for them at the Beehive. After the groups reunited, very shortly prior to the deadline, it was determined that Craig, Heidi, and Liane had bent the rules in obtaining their signatures, and very few of them counted toward the necessary total of 100. The group wound up surpassing that total anyway, however, winning the $25,000.
Shooting: The group selected their six best shooters. They were given the task of shooting ten clay pigeons, for $25,000. The catch was that from their shooting position, there was no ammo present. A kilometer away was an ammo dump, and the six shooters would start there, take one round, and ride a quad bike to the shooting position where they'd get one shot at a clay pigeon, turn around, go back, and start all over again. The three who were left out, Juan, Liane, and Heidi, would be snipers, trying to hit each shooter on the course with paintball guns. If all six were shooters were successfully taken out, no money would be won and the three snipers would all win free passes to the next episode. Heidi and Liane took positions on a ridge overlooking the quad bike course, while Juan sniped from a helicopter. Craig, Nat, and Kristy were taken out of the game very quickly. John and Mark each made multiple successful runs, eventually figuring out that the helicopter had to land and reload every time Juan fired 200 shots, meaning there would occasionally be a window of opportunity when they faced little resistance to getting to the shooting position. Liz only left the safety of the covered ammo dump once, to draw fire away from Mark, eliminating herself but allowing Mark another safe run. Mark successfully shot two clay pigeons before he was eliminated. John was the last shooter standing and successfully shot six targets, but was eventually hit by Juan from the helicopter, which denied the group the money and won each of the snipers a free pass to the next episode.
Episode 5.
Canyon Swing: The host told the players to pick four adrenaline junkies. These four were Juan, Heidi, Liane, and Craig, who were harnessed to an extremely long cable and placed at one edge of a wide, deep canyon, in what was called "the world's largest swing." The other four had to, in turn, answer a series of four questions about the other players, questions such as "Who was an extra on Dynasty?", "Who is a Spice Girls fan?" and "Who keeps worms as pets?" Each correct answer was worth $1,000 for the group kitty, but one wrong answer ended their chances of winning any further money and doomed one of the adrenaline junkies to take the plunge. Kristy answered all her questions correctly and earned $4,000 for the kitty - she was paired with Juan, who, in agreeing to take the drop anyway, earned another $1,000, revealing that the challenge was potentially worth $20,000. The only other money came from Mark answering one question correctly before missing his second and dooming Liane to take the swing. John and Liz both missed their first questions, sending Heidi and Craig, respectively, for the ride.
Bungee Jump: The four players who didn't do the Canyon Swing were told that they were to bungee jump off a bridge and touch a beach ball that the other four, in a boat in the water below, would release just as they jumped. The cable was of such a length that the jumper would briefly be submerged in the water at the end of their jump. The team could win $5,000 if any one jumper touched the ball, but if any of them outright refused to jump, $5,000 would be removed from the kitty. John happily jumped first, but badly missed the ball. Kristy and Liz were both terrified, but jumped, and narrowly missed the ball. Mark refused to jump and cost the team $5,000 from the kitty.
Kingston Flyer: The group decided on two people that they thought deserved a chance at immunity from elimination, choosing John and Kristy. The next assignment involved the historic Kingston Flyer train. John and Kristy were placed in the engine room, driving the Flyer, and would gain free passes through to the next episode if it arrived in Kingston, 10 kilometers from the starting position, before the others, split into three duos, finished their mini-tasks. Craig and Heidi were placed in a second-class cabin and had to search through one thousand ripped tickets to find the half that matched up with one they'd been given to form a completed ticket. Mark and Liane were in first-class and had to take a bundle of clothes belonging to the players and correctly dress mannequins representing each of them. Juan and Liz were in the buffet, and had to prepare scones and Devonshire tea. Craig and Heidi completed their task in short order, and Juan was revealed to be a skilled cook, easily preparing scones that passed muster. Mark and Liane were one swap of clothes away from having all the mannequins correctly dressed on three different occasions, but never did get the full correct answer, giving John and Kristy free passes and keeping the money from the kitty.
Episode 6.
Caving: This multi-faceted challenge first involved the group picking their two best tour guides, Mark and Heidi. These two were to take a group of real tourists through one of the Waitomo Caves and try to pass themselves off as genuine tour guides but had to as well chirp like a kookaburra, burst into tears, and get the tourists to take part in a group hug. Heidi passed off a bird sound as way for the tourists to spot an endangered bird, cried, purportedly, about her dog dying, and the two of them achieved the group hug simply by asking. Meanwhile, the other five players had to take part in an actual day of caving, through what was called "The Scary Cave," needing to find five PlayStation Portables with their names on them deep within the cave. Each PSP successfully retrieved earned $4,000 for the kitty. This challenge proved as difficult mentally as it was physically for some players, particularly Craig who hated being in water and was suffering from claustrophobia. The players were expressly told to follow the trail of blue glow sticks in the cave and though they were allowed to separate, they must not leave anyone behind. All five PSP's were successfully retrieved, but the players who did the caving would only earn their money if at least one of the tourists that Mark and Heidi led graded their performance as excellent. Four tourists graded them as average, but the other eleven all gave them excellent marks, earning the money. Mark and Heidi were then offered to add more money to the kitty if they'd spend the night in the cave through which they'd led the tourists. It was initially an offer of $5,000, that would be decreased by $1,000 apiece if the players who had done the caving would afford them food or camping gear for the night. The cavers gave them the camping gear, but not the food, and $4,000 was added to the kitty for the two of them spending the night in the cave.
It was revealed the next day that Craig and John had broken the rules by not directly following the trail of glow sticks while deep in the cave, so the $4,000 from their PSPs were revoked, giving a final total for this challenge of $16,000.
Jetboating: Each player took a lap on a jetboat course, retrieving an envelope with their name on it from a buoy on the far side and bringing it back to the starting dock. The player to record the fastest lap would be eligible to earn a free pass, and that player was Liz, completing the course one second faster than Craig had minutes earlier. With Liz pulled aside, the other six players were given a second mission on the jetboat course, to retrieve another envelope with their name on it and bring it back to the starting dock. These envelopes contained puzzle pieces, and within eight minutes, each player had to bring back their puzzle piece and the puzzle had to be solved to win $25,000 and deny Liz the free pass. They were also told that if anyone left the dock with their seatbelt unfastened, they would have to do an additional lap, and that for each minute over eight it took them to finish the challenge, $5,000 would be taken from the kitty. In this second round, there were several mistakes made: Heidi crashed into a wall, Liane knocked Mark's piece from the buoy into the water, Mark had to make two passes at the dock when returning with his piece, John left the dock with his seatbelt unfastened and had to do a second lap, and Kristy was also forced into doing a second lap (after time had already run out) when she tried to desperately fling her puzzle piece, the last, to the others on the dock, and it fell in the water. They wound up needing over nine minutes to finish the assignment, costing $5,000 from the kitty and assuring Liz a free pass through to the next episode.
Episode 7.
Mud: The players met up with the host at Hells Gate in Rotorua, and were divided by sex. The women had to cook corn and eggs the traditional Māori way, by lowering baskets full of them from a height into hot springs down below. For each dollar they made selling eggs and corn to locals, they would win $100 for the group kitty, at a maximum of $25,000. They were given an hour. The money, however, was locked in a safe, and two of them had to search through a mud pool for dogtags bearing the combination to the safe. Heidi and Liane cooked the food and made $172, which the host rounded up to $18,000 potential winnings. Liz and Kristy searched the mud pool for the dogtags and found only two of them, the first two digits to the four-digit safe combination, which were both 6. They delivered the two dogtags to Liane and Heidi and kept looking, but before they found the third dogtag, Liz figured out that the combination would be the word MOLE on a telephone keypad, 6653, since that was borne out by the first two digits both being 6. As they raced to Liane and Heidi's position, the other two tried two unsuccessful combinations before hearing the solution. The safe would lock for three minutes after a third incorrect guess, and their time ticked under three minutes as Liane and Heidi waited for Liz and Kristy to get close enough to them to tell them the solution. When she saw the safe's keypad, Liz told Heidi to key in 6642, since the number 1 on the safe had the letters A, B, and C where on a telephone it has no letters. This guess was incorrect, and they did not have time to try again. The host revealed, when the time ran out, that 6653 was indeed the correct combination.
Meanwhile, Craig and John were sent to find men in the town of Rotorua who could reasonably pass for each of them. They found eighteen men, and the twenty of them covered themselves in mud and wore masks, forming a lineup for the women. The women were told to pick Craig and John out of the lineup, and that they would win $5,000 for whoever they could pick out, but if they chose someone thinking it was Craig or John and it was not, the man they failed to identify would win a free pass through to the next episode. The women quickly identified John, and took a guess for Craig as their time was running out. Even when Craig took his mask off, no one was quite sure it was him, but it indeed was, and $10,000 was won.
Four-Wheel Drive: The players were told to pair up, a driver and a navigator, for a forest course that they were to tackle in off-road vehicles. They were given a practice run to familiarize themselves with the course, but upon returning to the starting position, they were told that for the real run, the navigators and drivers would have to switch positions, and the drivers would be blindfolded. The drivers would lose $5,000 from the kitty if their blindfolds were taken off, even just an inch, and the same penalty would be assessed if a navigator touched the steering wheel. There was a 30 minute time limit and $25,000 to be won. Craig and John, who had both had experience driving big vehicles, had initially volunteered as drivers, but this twist meant Liz and Heidi had to drive when it counted. Liane and Kristy easily made it through the course, but Liz's car became stuck on the side of the course for several minutes until John came to that position in the next car and was able to help Craig push it back onto the course. Liz's blindfold also came off, seemingly by accident, and she kept her eyes tightly closed as she retrieved it. All three teams narrowly finished within the time limit, and it was decided that Liz had followed the spirit of the rules by keeping her eyes closed, so no penalty from the kitty was assessed.
Episode 8.
Orienteering: The players were assigned to camp out in the countryside on a night when the temperature was forecast to drop to -5°C. Their camping gear was hidden in the area in front of them. They were told to split into two duos and one player left on his own to hunt for their gear. They had two hours to get to find their gear and return to form their campsite at the starting position. They were given maps and GPS's to help them find the bags. At each of three locations, the players were presented with a choice of either camping gear or money for the group kitty - the first choice was $1,000 or some food, the second was $2,000 or sleeping bags and mats, and the third was $5,000 or a tent. Craig, who was on his own, chose the gear every time, while Liane and Kristy chose $6,000 and the sleeping mats, and John and Liz opted for the money at each site. Craig, Liane, and Kristy returned to the starting position well before the time limit, but John and Liz, mistakenly traveling over a hill when the fastest way would have been around it, were too late and their money didn't count. The host came back to them late in the night and offered two beds in a camper van, for $2,000 from the kitty. Liane and Kristy took the opportunity to get out of the cold, reducing the group's winnings for this assignment to $4,000.
Bobcat Basketball: The players were taken to a construction site and put behind the wheels of Bobcats and mini-excavators. John, Liz, and Kristy had to take soccer balls, floating in a pool of water, grab them with the excavator, and take them to Craig and Liane who waited at the halfway point with Bobcats. Craig and Liane had to take the balls to the basket and drop them in for them to count. Each of the 25 balls was worth $1,000 if it made it successfully to the basket. John and Craig both did very well at this challenge, getting almost every ball they scooped into the basket. Kristy failed to even get one ball to the halfway point.
Free Pass Temptation: During Bobcat Basketball, the host secretively asked each player how much money they would pay from the kitty to earn a free pass through to the next episode. Kristy bid $13,000, Liane bid $25,000, Craig bid $10,000, and John and Liz both declined to place a bid at all. Liane was awarded the free pass for $25,000. The others were shocked at her high bid.
Free Pass Refund: During the elimination, Tom asked Liane if she'd give up the free pass for $50,000. This was consisting of the $25,000 she bidded for the free pass, and a $25,000 bonus. She instantly accepted this offer, increasing the kitty. But because the computer test had "not" been taken yet (unlike season 3 where the free pass was awarded "after" the tests had been taken) Liane still had to do the test. Some of the other players found it suspicious, as the Mole is told beforehand what most of the assignments are. In Liane's case, the players thought she was trying look like a hero and look less like the Mole.
Liane's name was typed in first, and the green screen appeared, relieving her. Kristy's name was typed in second, and the screen turned red.
Episode 9.
Sky Tower: Craig and Liz met up with the host in Auckland, who told them that John and Liane were up very high in the Sky Tower; Liane was outside on a small ledge on the 61st floor, and John was in the crow's nest. Craig and Liz's assignment was to, within an hour, get to them using the 1,462 stairs to Liane on the observation deck, and once there climb up the center of the tower to get to John. On the way, in the stairwell, there were pictures of the fifty states of the United States of America, and they were told to remember them. John and Liane's assignment also involved the states, as they had to simply recall them from memory. Liane was also encouraged to talk to the people on the other side of the glass on the observation deck, and happened to encounter an American tourist who helped her get all the correct states. Craig and Liz arrived to Liane, and subsequently to John, in time. John had written all of his and Liane's answers on a white board, and once the four of them were together, they were told to discard the white board and recite the fifty states from memory, within five minutes. Each state correctly named would earn $500 for the kitty. They got 46 states correct, neglecting only Michigan, Connecticut, Kansas, and Louisiana.
Free pass: On a yacht to their next location, the host told the players they must unanimously assign a free pass through to the final round to one player, or lose $25,000 from the kitty. They seemed at one point to agree, albeit grudgingly, to give the free pass to John, who had said he'd rather lose the money and keep the playing field level but would take it if they offered it to him. Upon arriving at their destination, however, Liz backed out and wouldn't agree to vote for John, which cost $25,000 from the kitty.
Night Maze: The four players were faced with a life-sized hedge maze in the dead of night and told that they must retrieve five light beacons from within the maze, each worth $5,000. Also in the maze was a hunter, and if the hunter tagged a player, he was out. Additionally, if the player was carrying any beacons when he was tagged, the beacons would be out of play. The others could monitor the progress of the runner (and the hunter) on an overhead camera shot and guide the runner. John ran first and was tagged by the hunter while carrying two beacons. The other three all successfully retrieved one of the remaining beacons each, winning $15,000.
Episode 10.
Extreme Challenges: One by one, the players each received a harrowing or physically difficult challenge, chosen at random: Liz had to do a tandem parachute jump from a height of 5 kilometers, Craig had to bungee jump from a height of 134 meters (three times the height of the bungee jump that took place earlier in the season), and John had to spend half an hour as a passenger in a stunt plane doing aerial acrobatics without vomiting. As each prepared for their task, the twist was revealed - $25,000 would only be won if exactly two of them, no more and no less, went through with their challenges. All three ended up speculating that someone else would back out and went through with their challenges themselves, so no money was won.
Two Questions: The last challenge took place on another boat trip. One at a time, each player answered two morality questions where the choices were the other two players, such as "Who is more likely to leave a note with their phone number on the windshield of a parked car they accidentally hit, Liz or John?" The other two were given $10,000 from the kitty to bet on the answers the other player gave, and could bet between $1,000 and $5,000 on each question. Liz and John got both of Craig's questions wrong and lost $7,000. Craig and John got one of Liz's questions right and one wrong, finishing at even money. Craig and Liz got one of John's questions right and one wrong, finishing $1,000 ahead and thus losing $6,000 all told for this assignment.
For this last round only, the quiz was done prior to the live portion of the show. Each player was locked into a compartment on the Kingston Flyer, one of the assignments on an earlier episode, to take the final test. The host unlocked the winner's compartment, and Liz emerged onto the stage in Sydney, winning the $203,000. The host then told her to open the Mole's door, and she uncovered John. Since she had correctly identified John as the Mole on the quiz, he did not get to keep the money kept from the group kitty, but was presented with two tickets for a holiday to Rarotonga. Craig ended up being the runner-up. Liz had suspected John as the Mole in the quizzes right from the very start.
Tom admitted John had him fooled, as he thought Liane was the mole.
Bob from season 3 made another appearance outside the studio during the Mole reveal.
Mole Activity.
Sabotage.
The following acts of sabotage were revealed in the final episode:
Christchurch: John's onscreen profile listed him an avid chess player, but he did nothing to help Craig win the first game, and only spoke up in the second when the team was already in position to win.
Crayfish: John's profile also listed him as a strong swimmer, but he only retrieved one cray, from the easiest pot, and feigned fatigue when returning to the boat.
Māori Waka: Another of John's hobbies is canoeing, but in this assignment, he purposely used a poor rowing stroke that slowed the waka down and kept them from winning the $10,000.
Hostage Rescue: John knew immediately that he and Liane had been taken to a police holding cell (this was also called a clue, as John's vocation was a police detective). He did not volunteer this information to Liane or the rescuers and tried to waste time having Liane sit on his shoulders to look out a window and pick out landmarks that weren't of much help on their own. However, when Liane figured out the clue in the cell that told them the city they were in, and the players resourcefully sent the boat to retrieve the car team, the group wound up winning this $25,000 anyway.
Shooting: John tried to look like the hero in this challenge, making six successful runs for ammo and hitting the clay target each time he got back to the shooting position. He needed only to crash his quad bike once to make himself an easy target for Juan in the helicopter to keep this $25,000 from ultimately being won.
Canyon Swing: John purposely missed an easy question when Heidi was attached to the canyon swing. The question he was asked was: "Who is a Spice Girls fan?", to which John answered "Kristy", when in fact the correct answer was "Juan". Kristy reveals in her confessional that "you couldn't tell me who was a Spice Girls fan and who wasn't. That was probably the easiest question out of everyone's".
Caving: John pointed Craig away from the path of the blue glow sticks deep in the cave, knowing full well that it was the wrong way, and cost the kitty another $8,000.
Jetboating: John intentionally left the dock with his seatbelt unfastened, pretending to fumble with it, and had to do an extra lap.
Orienteering: John held the map in his duo with Liz, but never once used it. He allowed Liz to lead them, based on her GPS, over the hill to base camp, when he knew that was the wrong way and they'd never make it on time. Only when Liz took the map did they head to the correct route around the hill, but by then it was too late and another $8,000 was lost.
Night Maze: John not only allowed himself to get caught by the hunter, but purposely took a turn divergent from Craig's directions, taking a second beacon that was put out of play for a loss of $10,000.
The following act of sabotage was spotted during the series, but not mentioned in the final episode:
Avalanche: John led his group the wrong way and in doing so took a long time to search for the beacon, almost costing the assignment.
Clues.
The following clues were revealed in the final episode:
Profiles Clue: Below the pictures in the onscreen profiles was Braille writing, that initially said "Who is the traitor?" The first word changed each week for the next eight weeks, and those words spelled out "The Mole is going to reveal himself tonight." This meant the Mole was a man. Also in the profiles, as the facts cycled in and out, numbers were apparent on the screen, and they were an alphabet code (where 1=A, 2=B, and so on). The messages spelled out "The Mole is not ___" a different player each week, and in week nine, it spelled out "The Mole is not Craig." Although not shown on the final segment, in week 10, it said: "The Mole is John". Since the Braille writing indicated that the Mole was a man, that cancels Liz of being the traitor. This left only John.
599: The magic number from the counting challenge was itself a clue, one that Liz was said to have picked up upon. The number 599 can be converted by telephone code to JWW, the initials of John William Whitehall, the Mole.
The following clue was spotted during the series, but not mentioned in the final episode:
Main Title Clue: At every main title introduction throughout the entire show, John was the 4th person to be shown. The word MOLE has 4 letters in it suggesting that John is the mole.
John later claimed that he had attempted a sabotage in every challenge except the very first one, and some parts of his 'confession' referring to them simply weren't aired.

Vesna Škare-Ožbolt

Vesna Škare-Ožbolt (born 20 June 1961 in Osijek) is a Croatian politician.
Before the first democratic elections in 1990, Škare-Ožbolt used to work in Croatian judiciary. In the 1990s she joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and became one of the advisors to President Franjo Tuđman.
In the late 1990s she handled the sensitive negotiations leading to a peaceful return of Serb-occupied areas of eastern Slavonia to Croatian sovereignty.
After defeat of the HDZ party in the 2000 parliamentary elections, Škare-Ožbolt, widely perceived as a moderate, left that party and followed Mate Granić to newly formed Democratic Centre (DC). Three years later, she won a seat in Sabor, which turned out to be the only one for DC.
After Granić resigned she took the leadership of DC and joined the government of Ivo Sanader as the minister of justice. She was the only non-HDZ minister in Sanader's cabinet.
Croatian judiciary has generally been perceived as one of the most corrupt and most inefficient branches of government. Škare-Ožbolt launched a highly publicised drive for reform, most notably by trying to digitalise the land registries, which have been notoriously inaccessible.
During the last months of her tenure, Škare-Ožbolt was involved in highly publicised extradition proceedings against former Serb warlord Dragan Vasiljković, which were ultimately unsuccessful. At the same time, the Croatian government's legal strategy the Trial of Gotovina et al was leaked to the press, allegedly by the Ministry of Justice.
On 10 February 2006, Sanader dismissed Škare-Ožbolt and replaced her with Ana Lovrin, an HDZ member.
Škare-Ožbolt's party failed to get any seats at the November 2007 parliamentary elections.
In summer of 2009 she announced her candidacy in the Croatian presidential election, 2010. She won 1.89% of the vote in the first round and was eliminated.

Slate (turkey)

The Slate, or Blue Slate, is a breed of domestic turkey known for the slate gray color of its plumage. Lighter birds are sometimes called Lavender turkeys. Turkeys of the Slate breed may actually be any number of shades between pure black and white, but only ash-gray birds are eligible for showing under the directive of the American Poultry Association’s ‘’Standard of Perfection’’, into which they admitted as a variety in 1874. Slate turkeys are listed as critically endangered by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, and meet the definition of a heritage turkey breed.

Procession (The Moody Blues song)

"Procession" is a 1971 song by The Moody Blues, and it is the opening track on their album "Every Good Boy Deserves Favour". It is their only song to have been co-written by all five members of the band.
For the most part, "Procession" is an instrumental song, with the exception of its three spoken words: "desolation", "creation", and "communication". These words, as well as other words ending in "-ation" also appear on the album track "One More Time to Live."
"Procession" basically describes the history of music from the beginning of time up to the present. It begins with synthesized electronic sounds, which is then followed by the sound effects of wind, rain and thunder. This part represents "desolation" and "creation." At the end of this part, the piano (played by Mike Pinder) plays the notes E-G-B-D-F, which stands for the album's title "Every Good Boy Deserves Favour", which is a phrase to help musicians remember the notes on the treble clef.
The song continues with the sound of prehistoric drums, and all of the band members (including Edge) chanting "Aum" in a prehistoric style. This represents the idea of "communication."
The song then goes on to describes different development in music. This begins with a flute and sitar duet, played by Ray Thomas and Justin Hayward, respectively. This is followed by a flute and mellotron duet, played by Thomas and Mike Pinder, respectively. Pinder then plays a short harpsichord solo, and a synthesizer solo. The song then ends with an electric guitar and bass guitar duet, played by Hayward and John Lodge, respectively.

The City Sun

The City Sun was a weekly newspaper that was published in Brooklyn from 1984 through 1996. Its primary focus was on issues of interest to African Americans in New York City.
"The City Sun" was founded by African-American journalists Andrew W. Cooper and Utrice C. Leid. Cooper served as publisher and Leid as managing editor. Film critic Armond White was the arts editor.
"The City Sun", whose motto was "Speaking Truth to Power", was rare among black-owned newspapers in its critical attitude toward African-American politicians. It could be unsparing in its criticism of prominent African Americans. In a front-page editorial in 1993, the newspaper advised David Dinkins, New York's first African American mayor, that he was "beginning to look like a wimp".
In 1989 "The City Sun", together with the "Amsterdam News", another black-owned newspaper in New York, published the name of the "Central Park jogger", Trisha Meili, who had been raped and beaten almost to death. Leid explained her decision to name the jogger by referring to an incident involving Tawana Brawley, a minor who said she had been raped, and the double standard practiced by the mainstream media:
The same media had no difficulty identifying the underage Wappinger-Falls teenager [Brawley by name invading the sanctity of her home to show her face ... have been careful to avoid identifying the Central Park woman.
Cooper was recognized as Journalist of the Year by the National Association of Black Journalists in 1987 for his work at "The City Sun".
In 1996, financial difficulties led Cooper to shut down "The City Sun". The business owed $380,000 in taxes and it had been evicted from its offices for not paying its rent.
According to "The New York Times", "The City Sun" had a circulation of 18,500 in 1987. In 1996, when "The City Sun" ceased operations, "The Times" wrote that the newspaper's circulation could not be determined.

Grand Lodge of Virginia

The Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons of Virginia, commonly known as "Grand Lodge of Virginia", is the oldest independent masonic grand lodge in the United States with 42,000 members in over 300 lodges.
History.
The plans for its creation took root in a convention held on May 6, 1777. The grand lodge was formally constituted on October 30, 1778, with its headquarters in Williamsburg, Virginia by the union of nine chartered lodges: Norfolk, at Norfolk; Port Royal in Caroline County; Blandford at Petersburg; Fredericksburg at Fredericksburg; Saint Tammany at Hampton; Williamsburg at Williamsburg; Botetourt at Gloucester Courthouse; Cabin Point in Prince George County and Yorktown at Yorktown. Three other lodges in the colonial era chose not to participate.
The grand lodge relocated its offices to Richmond, Virginia in 1784, where it remains to this day.
George Washington was invited to be the first Grand Master, but was unable to accept the honor due to his military duties in the war for American independence, and because he had never been installed as master or warden of a lodge, he did not consider it masonically legal to serve as Grand Master.

<doc id="19417529" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19417529" title="Meriam Report">
Meriam Report

The Meriam Report (1928), whose official title was The Problem of Indian Administration, was commissioned by the Institute for Government Research (IGR, better known later as the Brookings Institution) and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The IGR appointed Lewis Meriam as the technical director of the survey team, to compile information and report of the conditions of American Indians across the country. Meriam submitted the 847-page report to the Secretary of the Interior, Hubert Work, on February 21, 1928. 
The report combined narrative with statistics to criticize the Department of Interior's (DOI) implementation of the Dawes Act, and overall conditions on reservations and in Indian boarding schools. The Meriam Report was the first general study of Indian conditions since the 1850s, when the ethnologist and former US Indian Agent Henry R. Schoolcraft had completed a six-volume work for the US Congress. The Meriam Report provided much of the data used to reform American Indian policy through new legislation: the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. It strongly influenced succeeding policies in land allotment, education, and health care. The report found generally that the US federal government was failing at its goals of protecting Native Americans, their land, and their resources, both personal and cultural.
Lewis Meriam and the survey team.
Lewis Meriam was born in Salem, Massachusetts in 1883. He received degrees in English and government from Harvard University, law degrees from the National Law School and George Washington University, and a Ph.D. from the Brookings Institution. He worked for several government bureaus both before and after his work on the Indian Survey, including the bureaus of Census and Children’s Welfare. 
In 1926, Interior Secretary Hubert Work chose Meriam to head a survey team to investigate Indian Affairs because of his experience with the technical study of government operations, as well as his expertise in government administration. Meriam spent 3 years working on this project, which became known as the “Meriam Commission” or the “Meriam Report”. His involvement in Indian affairs ended in 1936 because of his skepticism of the New Deal. 
In 1946 he was appointed as Vice President of the Brookings Institute. He died in Kensington, Maryland, on October 30, 1972.
The survey team.
Meriam had difficulty choosing a team because many of the prospective members could not leave their jobs. The IGR required team members to be “persons highly qualified as specialists in their respective fields, scientific in their approach, not sensationalists, and free from preconceived views and opinions that would interfere with their impartiality and fairness in gathering and interpreting the facts.” He finally gathered a team composed of several specialists in a variety of disciplines: Ray A. Brown (legal aspects), Henry Roe Cloud (Indian adviser), Edward Everett Dale (economic conditions), Emma Duke (Indian migration to urban areas), Dr. Herbert Edwards (physician) (health), Fayette Avery McKenzie (source materials), Mary Louise Mark (family life), W. Carson Ryan, Jr. (education), and William J. Spillman (agriculture).
The report.
General information.
Authorized by the Institute for Government Research on June 12, 1926 at the request of the Secretary of the Interior, the Meriam Commission was charged with investigating the affairs of Indians in the United States. To maintain unbiased standards for the survey, it was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, not by any government agency or agent. “The investigation would cover nearly all reservations and would deal with educational, industrial, social, and medical activities of the BIA of Indian Affairs, as well as with Indian property rights and economic conditions.”
The team conducted seven months of field work to gather its information. They conducted field work in 23 states, selected based on a report by the Bureau of Indian Affairs that arranged states in order of number of Native American inhabitants. The report showed 23 states having more than 1,000 Native American inhabitants, the top three being Oklahoma, Arizona, and South Dakota. The team visited a total of 95 reservations, agencies, hospitals, and schools. At least one member of the survey team visited each of these 95 locations; often members of the team were forced to work independently in order to complete the required work in the shortest possible amount of time. “Secretary Work insisted that the survey be completed within one year, so that he might effect changes before a new administration took office in Washington.” This field work produced a report of 847 pages consisting of the following eight sections:
The report is concise and unbiased in its analysis: it states the facts of Indian conditions of the 1920s. The conclusion of the report reflects the opinions of the survey team. For example, the report states that “any policy for Indians based on the notion that they can or should be kept permanently isolated from other Americans is bound to fail.” In the report, the survey team included extensive recommendations for the correction of deficiencies, notably in health, education, and government cooperation for legal and social issues.
Health.
The report states, “the health of the Indians compared with that of the general population is bad.” It said that the general death rate and the infant mortality rate were high. Serious diseases, such as tuberculosis and trachoma, were very widespread both on reservations in general and specifically at off-reservation boarding schools. In its section on health care services provided by the government to Native Americans, the report states: “The hospitals, sanatoria, and sanatorium schools maintained by the Health Service, despite a few exceptions, must generally be characterized as lacking in personnel, equipment, management, and design.” The government, although it had numerous on- and off-reservation health care institutions, did not provide sufficient care for Indian patients. The report noted, “the most important single item affecting health is probably the food supply.” A further setback facing healthcare on Indian reservations was a general lack of knowledge of the Indian languages by healthcare providers.
Economy.
The report concluded that “The income of the typical Indian family is low and the earned income extremely low.” The report addressed the poverty thought to have resulted from the individual allotment policy of the Dawes Act. It found: “In justice to the Indians it should be said that many of them are living on lands from which a trained and experienced white man could scarcely wrest a reasonable living.” Not only was loss of land a factor in reservation poverty found on reservations, but the land they held was largely unsuitable for family farming and agriculture. The survey found that “the economic basis of the primitive culture of the Indians has been largely destroyed by the encroachment of white civilization.” A culture that previously had depended on its environment as a sustainable economy was losing the very land on which they survived. The report identified the problems with changing political appointees under elected presidential administrations. Elections tended to bring about a change in top political appointees and changes in economic development programs; thus, the BIA supported no long-term development on reservations. The report also states: “Little attempt has been made to formulate a broad constructive program for the service as a whole, extending over a long term of years, and having for its goal the general improvement of economic conditions.”
Education.
The Meriam Report emphasized the need for education but it suggested that such education should be based on integration of Indian children into the majority culture, rather than educating Indian children in separate institutions, as previous education policies had stressed. The first line in the education section states, “The most fundamental need in Indian education is a change in point of view.” The report was particularly critical of Indian boarding schools: “The survey staff finds itself obligated to say frankly and unequivocally that the provisions for the care of the Indian children in boarding schools are grossly inadequate.” The survey team concluded that the boarding schools provided poor diet, were overcrowded, did not provide sufficient medical services, were supported by student labor, and relied on a uniform curriculum rather than raising teacher standards. While the report drew attention to the gross deficiencies of Indian boarding school education, the assimilationist policies of Indian education, dependent on such boarding schools, continued for another 40 years. The schools reached their peak student enrollment of 60,000 in the 1970s.
Results.
The Meriam Report can be seen to have affected several aspects of government policy. “Acting upon the emergency recommendations of the Meriam Report, President Hoover requested additional funds to supply adequate food and clothing for pupils in the Indian schools.” Additionally, Charles J. Rhoads and J. Henry Scattergood (Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs, appointed by Hoover), accomplished or initiated many of the recommendations of the Meriam Report. President Hoover appointed Rhoads to put together a reform package which included the closure of unpopular reservation boarding schools and improved medical facilities. However, nothing was immediately done to change the alloted land situation which caused disappointment among Native Americans. They would have to wait until 1934 for the policy of allotment to come to an end. 
The most significant and influential effect of the Meriam Report was from its strong criticism of the Dawes Act and analysis of its failings. Also known as the General Allotment Act, the Dawes Act of 1887 had sought to break up the communal Indian land by allocating allotments to individual Indian households, encouraging families to undertake subsistence farming, the model of European-American culture. 
“The immediate result of the report’s attack on allotment was a decline in the issuance of allotted lands. In the four fiscal years prior to the initiation of the study, 1922–1926, approximately 10,000 Native Americans were allotted over 3 million acres from their Reservations. In comparison, during the fiscal years 1929-1932, the 4 years immediately following the publication of 'The Problem of Indian Administration,' a little over 2,800 Native Americans were allotted less than 500,000 acres.” 
Within five years of the Report, the policy of allotment was abandoned altogether. On June 18, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Indian Reorganization Act into law. Although the Meriam report did condemn allotment and had an impact on the Indian Reorganization Act, the Act was actually largely attributed to John Collier who had been appointed by Roosevelt as Commissioner for Indian Affairs. This new act ended allotment and permitted tribes to organize their own governments and to incorporate their trust lands communally.

1988 Chatham Cup

The 1988 Chatham Cup was the 61st annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
Up to the last 16 of the competition, the cup was run in three regions (northern, central, and southern). National League teams received a bye until the final 64 stage. In all, 147 teams took part in the competition, a new record for the time.
The 1988 final.
The final was the third and last to be held over home and away legs. The format was abandoned for the 1989 Chatham Cup as it proved unpopular. The 1988 final was the only one to be decided on the away goals rule, with Waikato United winning after scoring more goals in the first leg in Christchurch, despite both matches ending in draws.
The Christchurch team included Steve Sumner, returning to the city after a spell with Gisborne, and playing for the team he had played against in the 1987 final.
The first leg was held in Christchurch, and proved to be an exciting match. Waikato took the lead through Steve Tate, and Lance Bauerfeind doubled their advantage. Christchurch never gave up, and scored twice in the last 20 minutes through John Hanson and Johan Verweij.
The two goals scored by Waikato in the first match were to prove invaluable. The second tie, in Hamilton, was evenly balanced. Waikato's Steve Tate again opened the scoring, with a goal after 17 minutes. The away goals rule meant that Christchurch would then need two goals — a 1–1 draw would not be enough for them. In the event, one goal was all they got, via a Keith Braithwaite penalty a quarter of an hour before the final whistle.
The Jack Batty Memorial Trophy for player of the final was awarded to double goalscorer Steve Tate of Waikato United.
Results.
Final.
Aggregate score 3-3. Waikato United won on away goals.

1960 NFL Expansion Draft

The 1960 NFL Expansion Draft was the first National Football League (NFL) draft in which a new expansion team, named the Dallas Rangers, selected its initial players. The NFL awarded Dallas, Texas a franchise to compete for revenue with Lamar Hunt's Dallas Texans of the upstart American Football League. The Dallas expansion franchise was approved too late for it to participate in the 1960 NFL Draft which had been held on November 30, 1959. Dallas is the only NFL expansion team to not have had the benefit of a college draft in its first year.
So that the Rangers (Cowboys) could become competitive with existing teams, the league gave them the opportunity to select current players from existing teams. That selection was provided by the expansion draft, held on March 13, 1960. In this draft, the Rangers chose thirty-six players from the existing twelve teams. The NFL also assigned the rights to 1960 NFL Draft picks Don Meredith (who had been drafted by the Chicago Bears) and Don Perkins (drafted by the Baltimore Colts) to the Cowboys for a couple of future draft picks.
Twenty-two players made the active roster that season. Eleven players played only one year with Dallas. Eight players (including Jack Patera, who was injured early in the 1961 season) played in 1960 and 1961. The three remaining players from the draft started for several years, including: Bob Fry, Tackle, 1960–64; Jerry Tubbs, Linebacker, 1960–66; and Frank Clarke, Wide Receiver, 1960–67.
On March 19, 1960, The Rangers renamed themselves the Cowboys.
Rules of the Draft.
Every existing NFL team listed nine players, and the Rangers (Cowboys) selected three players on the list from each team.

A Pair of Briefs

A Pair of Briefs is a 1962 British legal comedy film directed by Ralph Thomas and starring Michael Craig, Mary Peach, Brenda De Banzie and James Robertson Justice. A new female barrister bonds with a male rebel in chambers, and together they try and piece together a case.
Plot.
The "Brief" of the title refers to the document which a solicitor in the UK court system writes to instruct a barrister who will plead the solicitor's case in court. Unfortunately barristers Tony Stevens and Frances Pilbright, as juniors, receive nothing but routine briefs concerning sewers. When a juicy brief concerning a writ for "restitution of conjugal rights" appears, they take opposite sides in the case. Pilbright works fiercely for her client, a woman whose marriage was disrupted by World War II. Stevens advocates for the other side, a man who denies that he was ever married to the plaintiff, although all records have been destroyed during bombing raids. For her part, the woman claims that her husband left her after she temporarily lost her memory. The two barristers squabble in court, inevitably becoming attracted to each other in the process.
Pilbright, about to lose the case, makes a furious declaration in which she declares "the Law is an Ass!". Stevens, by this time, has more sympathy for her and joins her in this.
In their zeal, they offend the presiding judge, Justice Haddon. Taking them aside, he privately informs them that the suit is intended to fail, as the woman has married a millionaire and wants to remove any grounds for her previous husband to blackmail her, so their efforts were for nothing. By this time, however, the two barristers are in love.

Profit (accounting)

In accounting, profit is the difference between the purchase and the component costs of delivered goods and/or services and any operating or other expenses.
Definition.
There are several important profit measures in common use. Note that the words "earnings", "profit" and "income" are used as substitutes in some of these terms (also depending on US or UK usage), thus inflating the number of profit measures.
To accountants, Economic Profit, or EP, is a single-period metric to determine the value created by a company in one period—usually a year. It is Earnings After Tax less the "Equity Charge", a risk-weighted cost of capital. This is almost identical to the economists' definition of economic profit.
There are analysts who see the benefit in making adjustments to economic profit such as eliminating the effect of amortized goodwill or capitalizing expenditure on brand advertising to show its value over multiple accounting periods. The underlying concept was first introduced by Schmalenbach, but the commercial application of the concept of adjusted economic profit was by Stern Stewart & Co. which has trade-marked their adjusted economic profit as Economic Value Added (EVA).
Optimum Profit is a theoretical measure and denotes the "right" level of profit a business can achieve. In the business, this figure takes account of marketing strategy, market position, and other methods of increasing returns above the competitive rate.
Accounting profits should include economic profits, which are also called economic rents. For instance, a monopoly can have very high economic profits, and those profits might include a rent on some natural resource that a firm owns, whereby that resource cannot be easily duplicated by other firms.

Warragul Football Club

Warragul Football Club is an Australian rules football club currently in the Gippsland Football League (GFL), fielding Senior, Reserve, Under 18 and Under 16 football teams, as well as A, B, C Grade and Under 17, Under 15 and Under 13 netball teams.
History.
The Club was formed in 1879 by William Paul and its first games were played against other local football clubs including Drouin, Buln Buln, Morwell, Traralgon and Berwick.
Warragul's guernsey was originally black with a red V, until 2000 when the guernsey was changed to the current colours of teal, white, red and black. The 'Gulls' have had a proud history especially through the successful years of the early 1920s, 1970s and 1980s.
Lean seasons in 1998 and 1999 in the Gippsland/Latrobe FL, saw the club transfer to the West Gippsland FL, with the thought of providing a better chance of retaining players. The Victorian Country Football League provided this clearance for the Gulls to the WGFL, where they played from 2000-2004. However, the merging of the GLFL and WGFL saw Warragul resume its battles with former foes from 2005.
Since 2005, the club has been a part of the Gippsland FL, competing against clubs such as Bairnsdale, Drouin, Garfield (until their transfer to the EDFL), Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Maffra, Sale, Wonthaggi and Leongatha.
In 2010 and 2011, Warragul finished bottom of the ladder, winning only one game in each respective season. The club is currently building a young base of players to build on into the future, many of whom had success with the club in both the Under 16 and 18's previously.

Reykjavík-Rotterdam

Reykjavík-Rotterdam is an Icelandic film directed by Óskar Jónasson and starring Baltasar Kormákur.
Plot synopsis.
Like a fish on a dry land, Kristofer is stuck in a dull everyday routine, working as a security guard. He was fired from the freight ship on which he worked when he was caught smuggling alcohol. Faced with money problems, he is tempted to accept the help of his friend, Steingrimur, who manages to pull some strings to get his old job back. He decides to take his chances one last time on a tour to Rotterdam.
Release.
The film was released on 3 October 2008. It was broadcast (dubbed in German) on German television ARD on 1 January 2010.
Reception.
"Reykjavík-Rotterdam" is one of the biggest-budget Icelandic films of all-time, and features an all-star cast of Icelandic cinema. The film garnered a four-star rating from "Morgunblaðið", and has a 'fresh' rating of 8.2/10 at Rottentomatoes.com.
The film won five Edda Awards, including best script, director, editing, sound, and music:
An Icelandic Film and Television Academy committee chose "Reykjavík-Rotterdam" to be Iceland's submission to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, though it failed to receive an Oscar nomination.
"Variety", after a 2010 screening at the Palm Springs International Film Festival called it a "straightforward product from much of the team behind Baltasar Kormákur's considerably more eccentric "Jar City"" and an "uncommonly commercial item with brawny action, strokes of humor and a besieged rooting interest (played effectively by Kormákur)."
Hollywood remake.
Working Title Films released a U.S. remake entitled "Contraband" starring and produced by Mark Wahlberg. The original film's lead actor, Baltasar Kormákur—a successful director in his home country of Iceland—took on the role of director.

Scream (Chris Cornell song)

"Scream" is a song by American singer–songwriter Chris Cornell, from his third solo studio album, "Scream". "Scream" is the first official single for the US (and fourth overall) and was released on September 22, 2008. Timbaland is featured in the interlude of the song (but is not a featured artist on the song, in particular).
Music video.
A video was also shot for the album's title track, with director Alan Ferguson (Fall Out Boy, Gym Class Heroes). Filmed in Orange, California, the clip reflects the feel of the album, he said. 
"The idea Alan had for the video, which is pretty ingenious, is sort of capturing the two moods of the music," he said. "There's kind of two things going on. It's a record that's 111 beats per minute, which is fast. But the music and lyrics and the vocals are actually kind of slow and relaxed and flowing over this beat that's pretty uptempo and kind of chaotic and excited. The way Alan's shot the video, he's shooting both at the same time. My role in the video is performing the song in super-slow-motion, where I'm existing in this Zen-like world, singing these song lyrics and everything going on around me is super-fast, super-chaotic, and I'm just suspended in it. It's a filmic piece that has something to say about the song lyrics and the feel of the music. It's going to be very much a cinematic video. 
The video premiered on Yahoo! Music on December 15.
Official remix.
There is at least one official remix of ""Scream"" available, having been remixed by DJ Dean Coleman. The track hasn't been officially released in full however, save for a small section of it appearing on the "Scream: The Mixtape" release (an official digital-only mixtape put together by Cornell and DJ Skee), a shortened Radio Edit streaming on Dean Coleman's MySpace, and that same shortened version being applied to an official special version of the ""Scream"" music video.

Anonymous (TV series)

Anonymous is an Irish television series broadcast on RTÉ Two. Its concept is to disguise well-known personalities, with the use of prosthetic masks, bestow upon them a fake identity and set them up in what are intended to be humorous situations for the sake of entertainment. "Anonymous" is presented by Jason Byrne, who also uses a hidden microphone to communicate mischievous ideas via whispering to the disguised personality. It has run for three series. The last series was broadcast in 2009. Jason Byrne was offered funding for a fifth season, but turned it down, stating that it was too hard to find people who didn't know of the show and therefore saw through the ruses (its sister program, "Naked Camera" did not help matters). He wanted the show to be remembered as being good while it lasted, and not being cancelled when it became desperate. Byrne was the celebrity who went anonymous in the final episode (Hector O hEochagain, the second ever guest behind Samantha Mumba presented the show).
Participants.
The series is known for showing the then Progressive Unionist Party leader David Ervine in a humorous light in an episode filmed before his death in January 2007. Ervine was one of three political representatives from Northern Ireland who agreed to partake in the programme; the others were Paul Maskey of Sinn Féin and John Dallat of the SDLP.
They were interviewed by Belfast comedian Patrick Kielty, who was in the guise of New York TV reporter, "Betty Silverman". Ervine's family consented for the episode to be broadcast in the aftermath of his death.
In the opening episode of the third series, Westlife member Nicky Byrne, was dressed up as Mick Byrne, "an evangelistic Garda from Kiltimagh on a mission to clean up the mean streets of Swords."
For the role he had to put on a Longford accent and, as Garda Byrne, he took the names of foreign nationals, asking them for their licence to be in Ireland; asked locals for cigarettes, and chastised people for walking too fast and speaking too loudly in the betting shop. He then drove around the local shopping centre in a motorised trolley making his own siren sound and asking people where they were going.
He called to his own parents' house to ask for Westlife autographs and tickets for Croke Park and makes a fool of his friends, former Leeds United footballer Gary Kelly and rugby international Brian O'Driscoll.
Also featuring in the series were model Glenda Gilson as a tree-hugging eco-warrior, and TV presenter Craig Doyle as Argentine sports reporter "Rodrigo Depassa".
International Versions.
Anonymous has several different versions around the world, with the format being produced in countries including;
Germany, Romania, Spain (La Sexta), UK (ITV) (with Stephen Mulhern),
British channel ITV started broadcasting its own hour long version of the show on Saturday 18 July 2009, allotting it a prime time spot at 6.30pm.
In ITV's first episode, X Factor judge Louis Walsh, actress and comedienne Jennie McAlpine, Richard Arnold (TV presenter), former English rugby union player Austin Healey, actress Michelle Keegan, (singer Shayne Ward and former English rugby captain Matt Dawson went 'Anonymous'.

Copy Control Information

Copy Control Information (or CCI) is a two byte flag included in digital television streams that allows content owners to specify how content can be duplicated.
Originally defined as part of the 5C copy protection specification devised by DTCP working group back in 1998, it was later defined as part of the FCCs Plug and Play agreement in 2003. 
The two most popular flags used are Copy Freely and Copy Once. Copy Freely is essentially no flag at all, while Copy Once means that a DVR can make one copy, but no more copies can be made. The best examples of these in use are in regard to the TiVo and Windows Media Center. A show that is marked Copy Once can not be transferred to another TiVo via the Multi-Room Viewing feature and can not be transferred to the computer via TiVoToGo. In regard to Windows Media Center, shows marked Copy Once can only be played on the same PC in which they were recorded and the directly connected Extenders for Media Center like the Xbox 360—ATI Digital Cable Tuner must be running firmware 1.19.12 or Copy Freely is treated like Copy Once. 
The following flags exist:
The application of the CCI flag was specified on page 30 of the FCC Plug and Play agreement. In the order, it is specified that over-the-air broadcast television channels must be set to be Copy Freely and that non-premium subscription programming has to be set to at least Copy Once, but of course can be set to Copy Freely. This is determined by the cable television provider and can vary from one market to the next (even if both markets are served by the same company). Some operators tend to set all programs as Copy Once, preventing further distribution after a single PVR recording, and others tend to set all programs as Copy Freely.

Oscar Werner Tiegs

Oscar Werner Tiegs FRS FAA (12 March 1897 – 5 November 1956) was an Australian zoologist whose career spanned the first half of the 20th century. 
His contribution to the division of the phylum arthropoda into two parts, one including insecta, myriapoda, and peripatus, and the other including trilobites, crustacea, and arachnids, is considered to be an important contribution to zoology. He was acknowledged as having a remarkable ability for apt and beautiful drawings, and as being an excellent microscopist, as having a great capacity for meticulous accuracy, persistent work, and shrewd illicitation of relationships from massive detail. He is considered one of Australia's great zoologists and as having a permanent place in the history of zoology.
He was a Doctor of Science (University of Adelaide), a Fellow of the Royal Society, and a founding Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.
Early life and education.
Oscar Tiegs' father, Prussian born Otto Theodor Carl Tiegs, and mother, Helene Caroline Ottilie, née Meyer, from Hanover, migrated to Australia from Germany. The Royal Society states that Otto Tiegs had careers in both pharmacy and engineering, and had a high regard for learning, while others state that he was a merchant. In particular, in 1920 under oath, Tiegs described himself as a merchant.
Tiegs was born at Kangaroo Point, a suburb of Brisbane, and had two sisters, Olga Pauline and Edna.
As a child, he was fascinated by insects and put together a collection of about one thousand named beetles, which was eventually taken in by the Queensland Museum. He described himself as a timid but industrious boy with an absorbing interest in insects, and acknowledged the support of the Queensland Government entomologist, Henry Tyson.
He attended Brisbane State School until the age of 14, and Brisbane Grammar School from 1911 to 1915. He was awarded a scholarship to attend university.
University of Queensland.
At the University of Queensland he studied science, specialising in biology under Thomas Harvey Johnston, where he received training in animal morphology. He was awarded his Bachelor of Science in . During his honours course, he produced his first research paper: an anatomical study of the echiuroid worm (pseudobonelia). He received his Master of Science in , at the age of 25. He wanted to study medicine, but there was no medical school in Queensland, so instead continued into zoology.
In he was the beneficiary of a Walter and Eliza Hall in econonmic biology. He worked with scientists researching the control of the blowfly and prickly pear in Queensland, and was involved in the campaign to eradicate hookworm.
Adult life.
On 14 August 1926, Oscar Tiegs married Ethel Mary Hamilton, a telephonist, at the Presbyterian Church in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn.
Tiegs was known to form lasting friendships, even from relatively brief associations. For example, colleagues he met only once while on a trip to Europe in 1928, had fond memories of him. He was known as "Sandy" Tiegs to his friends and colleagues.
He was godfather to David, the son of his mentor and colleague, Professor Thorburn Robertson. 
Tiegs was always interested in learning and research, and was known to find administration and committee work distasteful. This would appear to be at odds with his being a Councillor, and Chair of the Library Committee, for the The Royal Society of Victoria.
As head of the Melbourne University's Department of Zoology, he encouraged research and empowered his staff to set their own courses of activity with a directed freedom that nurtured world class research. He tended not to be interested in the research of others unless it was closely aligned with his own, yet was proud of his staff and was keen to show visitors what his staff were doing.
He lectured without notes, mainly to first year students, to whom he gave a solid background in elementary zoology and comparative morphology, in a manner which was considered a model of presentation and clarity. He gave special lectures on arthropod evolution and the vertebrate nervous system to senior students. However, Oscar Tiegs' involvement in imparting knowledge started much earlier than his time at the University of Melbourne, he being a in biology at the University of Queensland in 1918.
In 1954 Oscar Tiegs was one of 23 Foundation Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science, and along with the other 22 foundation fellows was a petitioner to Queen Elizabeth II for the Academy's charter. He, Sydney Sunderland, and Thomas MacFarland Cherry, two other petioners and foundation members were responsible for drafting the by-laws of the newly formed Academy
The Melbourne University's zoological museum, now called the Tiegs Museum, owes much of the quality of its collection to Oscar Tiegs. He spent time and care improving and extending its holdings, based on his belief in the traditional morphological approach to zoology.
Oscar Tiegs was a prodigious worker, and, for example, would take on extra lecturing duties during staff absences to not load his other staff, and only in later years did he balance his time more out of work. He was fond of music, in particular Beethoven and Mozart, and critically appreciated pictures. These interests, of music, art, and literature he shared with his wife Ethel.
Some felt Oscar Tiegs, while honest, was direct to the point of bluntness, and had a keen sense of humour. He was known for supportive letters sent to friends during World War II, and the gift parcels sent by him and his wife. Oscar Tiegs' geographical isolation, and his own diffidence probably prevented him from maximising his contribution to zoology, although rather than diffidence others describe it as an unassuming disposition. He is described as shy and reserved, preferring the laboratory to the committee meeting or social function.
He suffered from aortic stenosis, and died of a coronary occlusion in his home in Hawthorn, aged 59.
Career.
Ocsar Tiegs' scientific interests and contributions ranged from the physiological analysis of nervous and muscular action to invertebrate embryology, his studies being comparable to the very best work the last century. He repeatedly turned from one area of research to another, only to return again. He was a dedicated practiser of desciptive morphology during a period when the majority of biologists were turning to experimentation.
Typically, even his first research paper, was to describe something unusually interesting, namely that the male of the echiuroid worm exhibits a greater degree of degeneration than other species, the tissues fusing with those of its female partner and the host.
He briefly made some helminthological investigations, for example with hookworm, and monogeneans before moving to the newly created Department of Zoology at the University of Adelaide in 1922.
University of Adelaide.
At Adelaide, because of the absence of Professor Johnston, he was appointed , as acting head of the department he organised the new department and its teaching. Here he was influenced by Wood Jones, Professor of Anatomy, and the physiologist Professor Brailsford Robertson, one of the pupils of Jacques Loeb. Oscar Tiegs spent three years at Adelaide, during which time he was granted a Bachelor of Science degree in and obtained his Doctorate of Science degree in both from the University of Adelaide, at the age of 25, his thesis being on the histology of metamorphosis of a chalcid wasp ("Nasonia"), specifically "Nasonia brevicornis" (now designated "Nasonia vitripennis").
Oscar Tiegs' doctoral thesis work was to be the basis for much of his later work, in embryological studies, and the study of fine structures in muscle. He found clear evidence that the apparent striation of muscle fibres did not arise from separate disks, but from a helicoidal organisation within the fibre. He also found a similar condition in vertebrate muscles. Later he discovered that former histologists had recorded the same thing, but their observations had received little attention. He contended that helicoidal striation is a general feature of muscles and that muscular conduction takes place along this helicoidal path, even though the evidence for this generality was against him, yet his cinematographic records supported his interpretation for arachnids and other arthropods.
Between 1922 and 1934 Oscar Tiegs was almost entirely concerned with the physiology of nerve and muscle, apparently influenced by Brailsford Robertson.
In 1925 he published the results of experiments regarding the importance of creatine. This line of research was inspired by the lactic acid hypotheses of muscular action at the time and before phosphagen was discovered.
University of Melbourne.
During 1925 Oscar Tiegs moved to Melbourne University's department of Zoology as a senior lecturer, then headed by Professor Wilfred Eade Agar.
In 1928 he obtained a Rockefeller Travelling Fellowship to visit Europe, where he worked for a while in the Anatomical School at Cambridge University, England, then headed by Professor Wilson, and in the Anatomical School at Utrecht University, the Netherlands, then headed by Professor Boecke.
Also in 1928, Oscar Tiegs was awarded the David Syme Research Prize.
As a histologist Oscar Tiegs developed an interest in Boecke's suggestion of a double innervation of vertebrate skeletal muscle. From this interest he undertook a physiological investigation of the sympathetic system in the muscle, finding no such action except in blood vessels, all muscular action seemingly being caused by an adrenalin-like substance.
Oscar Tiegs in this work corrected errors and ambiguities in the work of others, and showed the validity of some traditional interpretations.
Lamarckian inheritance.
Similarly, his experiments with Wilfred Eade Agar to test William McDougall's supposed demonstration of Lamarckian inheritance of training in rats were negative and showed the inadequacy of McDougall's controls, the first results being published in 1935.
Phylogenetics of arthropoda.
In Oscar Tiegs was granted a Master of Science degree from the University of Melbourne, and according to the Royal Society became Associate Professor of Zoology at Melbourne University, whereas according to the Australian Academy of Science and others this appointment occurred in , in particular the University of Melbourne, for , and his interests returned to insect metamorphosis. He followed the development of three species, the beetle "calandra", the symphylan "hansenialla", and "pauropus". He found the concept of "rejuvenation" to be invalid. He showed the impossibility of reconciling midgut development with a normal gastriculation process. Building on this work he undertook a four year investigation of the embryology of the symphylan "hanseniella agailis", followed by a three study of the embryology of pauropus silvaticus. He showed contrary to expectation that the progoneate genital ducts did not arise as is usual from coelomoducts in the embryo, but secondarily as epidermal ingrowths late in larval life, the progoneate form was merely a secondary adaptation to the anamorphic mode of growth of some myriapods by which new segments become added to the posterior end of the growing larva.
Oscar Tiegs thus showed that the characteristic of being "opisthogoneate", that is with posterior genital openings, and the characteristic of "progoneate", that is with the genital opening differently placed, anteriorly, are not dichotomous, and thus reduced the significance of the until then corresponding major classificatory zoological division. He proposed a new classification scheme based on head structure, this being supported by later work by others regarding antennal muscles, and locomotive behaviour and machinery in the relevant animals.
At the time of his death in 1956, Oscar Tiegs left a full draft of a review on the evolution of "arthropoda". Its final preparation and publication was undertaken by friends and colleagues. Oscar Tiegs typically also known for this work.
Further major work and recognition.
The Royal Society elected Oscar Tiegs as a fellow in for:
He was appointed to a Chair of Zoology at the University of Melbourne in which he held until his death, and became a full Professor in 1948.
Oscar Tiegs served as Dean of the Faculty of Science the University of Melbourne from 1950 to 1952.
In 1951 Professor Wilfred Agar died and Oscar Tiegs became Professor and took over as head of the Melbourne University Zoological Department.
Others state that Oscar Tiegs took the Chair of Zoology at the University of Melbourne in 1948 upon the retirement of Professor Wilfred Agar.
In 1954 he took sabbatical leave and travelled overseas a second time supported by a British Council travel grant. This second trip provided Oscar Tiegs with the opportunity to be formally admitted to the Royal Society, after being elected as a Fellow 10 years earlier. While in England he also chaired a . He also delivered a seris of three lectures on the flight muscles of insects at the University of London during March 1954
Oscar Tiegs returned to his area of doctoral studies for what was to be his last research, an exhaustive study of the flight muscles of insects and other arthropod muscles published in 1955. This analysis of the comparative myology and evolution of wide range of insect's flight muscles showed how such muscles evolved structurally at a histological level. He showed that the histogenesis of muscle in orthoptera (butterflies, moths, etc.) and simpler insects by the repeated division of rudimentary muscle fibres, but in higher orders of insect, free individual myoblasts applicate to young muscle fibres laying down a new fibril, contributing sarcoplasm and nuclei.
In 1956 Oscar Tiegs was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales, although the Australian Academy of Science has him listed, incorrectly, as receiving this award in 1928.
Memoria.
Tiegs Museum.
The University of Melbourne's zoological museum, established in 1887, is now named The Tiegs Museum after Oscar Tiegs. Oscar Tiegs was responsible for substantially improving the museum's collection, which was housed in its own room in the old Zoology Building. The room was called "The Tiegs Museum" and this title was now been officially adopted, and followed the museum to its new location in the Zoology Department's new premises in 1988.
Tiegs Place.
Canberra, the national capital of Australia, names its streets after nationally significant people, places, and events. Tiegs Place, a street in the suburb of Florey in Canberra, is named after Oscar Tiegs, notably for:
Kangaroo Point Natural History Project.
Included along a heritage trail through the CT White and James Warner parks at Kangaroo Point, Brisbane, Queensland, are interpretive signs which commemorate the life and work of Oscar Tiegs as one the pioneering scientists from the area.

Comprehensive income (accounting)

Comprehensive income is defined by the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, as “the change in equity assets of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.”
Comprehensive income is the sum of net income and other items that must bypass the income statement because they have not been realized, including items like an unrealized holding gain or loss from available for sale securities and foreign currency translation gains or losses. These items are not part of net income, yet are important enough to be included in comprehensive income, giving the user a bigger, more comprehensive picture of the organization as a whole.
Items included in comprehensive income, but not net income are reported under the accumulated other comprehensive income section of shareholder's equity.

Peter Gawthorne

Peter Gawthorne (1 September 1884 – 17 March 1962) was an Irish actor, probably best known for his roles in Will Hay films. Gawthorne was one of Britain's most called-upon "bit part" actors during the 1940s and 50s.
He was born in 1884 in Queen's County in Ireland, but spent most of his career in Britain. After two years at the "Academy of Dramatic Art", Gawthorne began a career on the London stage, eventually running up over twenty years experience on the stage. His debut was in 1906, a walking on part at His Majesty's Theatre, London. He was featured in the role of Albany Pope, receiving good notices, in the hit musical "The Boy" in 1917.
He worked for a number of companies but, in particular, Gainsborough Studios. He also toured Australia, South Africa and Americas, going into films in America before returning to Britain. Gawthorne also studied singing.
He worked extensively in cinema often playing military officers and stern, authority figures, many of whom frequently clashed with the bumbling idiots played by Hay and other well-known comedians such as George Formby, The Crazy Gang, Jessie Matthews, Jack Hulbert, Alastair Sim and Arthur Askey and Richard Murdoch.
He also worked with a number of famous straight actors including George Arliss, Errol Flynn and Leslie Banks.

Kazys Varnelis (artist)

Kazys Varnelis (February 25, 1917 in Alsėdžiai – October 29, 2010 in Vilnius) was an abstract painter from Lithuania. He lived and worked in the United States of America for fifty years, between 1949 and 1998. His distinctive painting style demonstrated optical and three-dimensional illusions based on geometric abstractions and minimal forms. His style combined elements of constructivism, minimalism, and op art. His work is sometimes described as a modernist interpretation of Lithuanian folk art and is owned by Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, Currier Museum of Art, and other museums. Varnelis was also an avid collector of antiques and bibliophile – his collection is now housed at the Kazys Varnelis House–Museum in Vilnius. His son, also named Kazys Varnelis is a noted architect, art historian, and theorist.
Early career.
Born in Alsėdžiai in the Samogitia region to a father who was a religious wood sculptor and painter, Varnelis graduated from Institute of Fine Art in Kaunas, Lithuania in 1941. He briefly worked as director of the Museum for Ecclesiastical Art before starting post-graduate studies in the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in 1943. Two years later he was awarded the degree of academic painter (). Varnelis did not return to the Soviet-occupied Lithuania and emigrated to the United States, where he settled in Chicago. From 1949 to 1963 he worked on ecclesiastical art and church interiors. To make a living, he owned a stained glass studio. He produced stained glass windows, bronze and marble works. In 1963 he switched his focus to private painting and sculpture. Recognition came in late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1968 he was invited to teach at the Olive–Harvey College where he later became full professor.
Rise to fame.
Varnelis presented his works at the Art Institute of Chicago in the 1967, 1969, 1971, 1974 during biennial exhibitions by Chicago artists, winning the Vielehr Award in 1969 and 1974. He held one-man shows at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1970), Milwaukee Art Museum (1974), Corcoran Gallery of Art (1973). In an 1971 article in Canadian art magazine "Artscanada" Dutch art historian Jan van der Marck attributed abstract decorative quality of Varnelis works to the ornaments found on traditional Lithuanian crosses that his father used to make. Van der Marck also attributed structural complexity to the complexities of the Lithuanian language. Varnelis used limited range of colors and relied on technical execution for transitions between the colors.
Varnelis's early works tended to display unitary designs that could be repeated endlessly. As his works evolved, Varnelis broke away from endless repetitions and square canvas, shaping his paintings according to the subject matter. In late 1970s he experimented with abstract architecture. Later works show elements of deformity borrowed from Surrealism and emphasized realism from Photorealism. 
In 1978 he moved to Villa Virginia in Stockbridge, Massachusetts which he extensively restored and where he had a private gallery for his works and collections. 
Return to Lithuania.
With Glasnost improving ties between East and West, Varnelis began to visit Lithuania and exhibited his work In the Art Exhibition Palace in Vilnius in 1988.
He exhibited his works in Europe throughout the 1990s in the Palace of Art in Budapest (1995), Tampere Art Museum (1996), and the Museum of Modern Art in Riga (1997).
In 1993, the Vilnius City Council gave two historic buildings on Didzioji Gatve in Vilnius, the houses of the Small Guild and the Masalski family, to the artist for his works. Varnelis moved back to Lithuania in 1998 where, with assistance from the Ministry of Culture and Vilnius Academy of Art, the Kazys Varnelis House–Museum was established in Vilnius. In 2003 it became a branch of the National Museum of Lithuania. The museum was established in a 15th-century building of former Merchants' Guild. The collection includes some 7,000 books and 150 maps, dating from the 16th century. The museum also houses paintings, sculptures, Renaissance furniture, Oriental art, and works by Varnelis. For merits to Lithuania, Varnelis was awarded the Knight Cross of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (1998) and the Commander Cross of the Order for Merits to Lithuania (2007). 
Varnelis died on October 29, 2010 in Vilnius after a long illness.

James A. Graham (psychologist)

James A. Graham, PhD, is a professor at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), in the Department of Psychology. He is a developmental psychologist whose work explores the social-cognitive aspects of children’s relationships. 
Education.
From grades 7 to 12, he studied drama at the School for Creative and Performing Arts (SCPA) in Cincinnati, Ohio. After high school graduation in 1988, he pursued undergraduate studies at Miami University in Oxford, OH. He received a Bachelors of Arts (BA) with a major in Psychology in 1992. In 1994, he completed a Master’s of Science in Psychology from the University of Memphis. In 1997, he was awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in Experimental Psychology (developmental specialization) from the University of Memphis.
Research.
His scholarship focuses on the social-cognitive aspects of peer relationships among school children (K-5) from both molar (peer group) and molecular (dyads) perspectives. 
There are 3 interdependent dimensions to his research program. One branch examines populations that are typically understudied, conceptually limited, and methodologically constrained (i.e., African-American children, children of incarcerated parents) in social science research. His research fills these voids by engaging researchers and students across a variety of fields in critical discourse about the sparse and limited work on the topic, and by presenting a more balanced discussion of the challenges and resilience in the lives of these groups of children. His scholarship moves beyond a deficit view of child development to a holistic account of the historical, cultural, economic, and social factors that influence developmental outcomes. A second branch of his research program centers on children’s development of empathy and prosocial behavior with peer groups and friends across childhood. An additional focus of his work establishes developmental science in the context of community-engaged research partnerships. 
He has published articles on the roles of race and gender in children’s friendships, children’s evaluations of social situations, children’s relationship to media, and program evaluation. In 2007, he co-authored a textbook with Yvette R. Harris, "The African American Child: Development and Challenges". In 2009 and 2010, he co-authored two additional books: the textbook "Developmental Science: An Introductory Approach" (Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company) and the edited text "Children of Incarcerated Parents: Theoretical, Developmental, and Clinical Issues" (Springer Publishing Company).
Teaching.
At TCNJ, he teaches courses in child development, research methods, and development across the lifespan. In addition, he teaches developmental seminars in children's social and personality development, ethnic and racial diversity among US children; cross-cultural child development; and children and the media. For the past decade, he has taught graduate Education and Psychology summer courses in Johannesburg, South Africa through TCNJ’s Graduate Global Program.

Hatakeyama Shigeyasu's grave

In spite of its prominence, next to nothing is known about the monument. On the base of the "hōkyōintō" is carved a date, the fourth year of the Meitoku era (1393), but its manufacture suggests it was built during the Muromachi period (1336–1573). Its upper portion, called "sōrin", is very long, in the style prevalent at that time. Also, the relationship between the grave and Hatakeyama Shigeyasu is, the traditional attribution notwithstanding, unclear. The reasons for the attribution are probably that it lies within the former Hatakeyama estate, and that Shigeyasu is known to have been killed in battle by Hōjō soldiery in Yuigahama.
Next to the "hōkyōintō" stands a black stele (on the left in the photo) erected in the 1920, which is however only indirectly related to the grave. Its text says:
Hatakeyama Shigeyasu's residence
Hatakeyama Shigeyasu was Hatakeyama Shigetada's eldest son. He had had a quarrel with Hiraga Tomomasa, who was Hōjō Tokimasa's son-in-law. Tomomasa hadn't forgotten the fact and so spoke to Tokimasa against both the Hatakeyama. Tokimasa himself hadn't forgotten how Shigetada had, following Minamoto no Yoritomo's will, tried to protect the shogun's son and heir Yoriie, and was looking for an excuse to kill them. Having received an order to that effect from shogun Sanetomo, he surrounded Shigeyasu's residence with his soldiers. Shigeyasu fought well, but in the end was killed. The day was June 22, 1205. and this is where the residence stood. The day after, Shigetada himself was tricked into going to Musashinokuni's (a region in the north eastern part of Kanagawa) Futamatagawa, where he was killed. 
Erected in March 1922 by the Kamakurachō Seinendan
Because Shigeyasu suffered from asthma and was having an attack when he was killed in battle, the "hōkyōintō" is popularly known as Rokurō-sama and is supposed to have the power to cure colds and coughs.

John Gombojab Hangin (1921–October 9, 1989) was a notable scholar of Mongolian studies. He authored several Mongolian dictionaries and textbooks and is credited by "The New York Times" with helping to establish recognition for the Mongolian People's Republic from the United Nations and the United States.
In China.
Hangin was born in Taibus Banner, Chahar, Inner Mongolia to a prominent family who had long been active in the Qing Dynasty court. He was sent to Hokkaido Imperial University in Japan to study during World War II, afterward taking a position as a secretary in the Mengjiang government of Prince Demchugdongrub. He was elected to the National Assembly of the Republic of China in 1947; however, after the Chinese Civil War ended with a communist victory, he emigrated to the United States in 1949.
In the United States.
In the US, under the guidance of Owen Lattimore, Hangin studied at Johns Hopkins University, the University of California, Berkeley, Columbia University, and Indiana University (where he received his Ph.D). After graduation, he served on the faculties of several universities, including Columbia University, Georgetown University and UC Berkeley, before settling at Indiana University.
Hangin acted as a conduit between Americans and Mongolians. "The New York Times", in its 1989 obituary, indicated that "is efforts helped to lay the groundwork for recognition of the Mongolian People's Republic by the United Nations in 1961 and American recognition in 1987." In addition to publishing several textbooks and dictionaries on the Mongolian language, Hangin also founded the Mongolia Society at Indiana Universality and established the Mongol-American Cultural Association (MACA).
Death and legacy.

Politics of Indiana

Indiana has long been considered to be a Republican stronghold and is rated R+7 on the Cook Partisan Voting Index. The current governor of Indiana is Republican Mike Pence, and republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly. It has only supported a Democrat for president five times since 1900 - in 1912, 1932, 1936, 1964 and 2008. Nonetheless, half of Indiana's governors in the 20th century were Democrats.
Governor.
While only five Democratic presidential nominees have carried Indiana since 1900, 11 Democrats were elected governor during that time. Before Mitch Daniels became governor in 2005, Democrats had held the office for 16 consecutive years.
The current governor of Indiana is Mike Pence.
Federal elections.
Presidential elections.
Former governor and U.S. Senator Evan Bayh announced in 2006 his plans for a presidential exploratory committee. His father was a three-term senator who was turned out of office in the 1980 Reagan Revolution by conservative Republican (and future Vice-President) Dan Quayle, a native of Huntington in the northeastern part of the state. However, Bayh announced that he would not be seeking the Presidency on December 16, 2006.
In the U.S. Presidential election, 2008, Barack Obama carried the state by 0.9%, which was the first time in many years that a Democrat won Indiana's electoral votes.
Congress.
Seven of the districts favor the Republican Party according to the CPVI rankings; there are currently seven Republicans serving as representatives and two Democrats. Historically, Republicans have been strongest in the eastern and central portions of the state, while Democrats have been strongest in the northwestern part of the state. Occasionally, certain counties in the southern part of the state will vote Democratic. Marion County, Indiana's most populated county, supported the Republican candidates from 1968 to 2000, before backing the Democrats in the 2004 and 2008 elections. Indiana's second most populated county, Lake County, is a strong supporter of the Democratic party that has not voted for a Republican since 1972.
Senate.
The state's U.S. Senators are Junior Sen. Joe Donnelly (Democrat) and Junior Sen. Dan Coats (Republican). Mr. Coats is popular in the state, with Mr. Donnelly just being sworn-in in 2013. In 2006, then Senior Sen. Richard Lugar (Republican) won reelection to a sixth term with 87% of the vote against no major-party opposition. In 2010, Sen. Coats won reelection to a third non-consecutive term with 55% of the vote against Democratic Congressman Brad Ellsworth and Libertarian business owner and teacher Rebecca Sink-Burris.
Senator Lugar lost in the 2012 Republican primary to the state treasurer of Indiana, Richard Mourdock, who had been favored by the Tea Party movement. Mr. Donnelly defeated Mr. Mourdock in the general election.
House of Representatives.
Indiana's delegation to the United States House of Representatives is not completely Republican either. Instead, it has generally served as a bellwether for the political movement of the nation. For instance, Democrats held the majority of seats until the 1994 Republican Revolution, when Republicans took a majority. This continued until 2006, when three Republican congressmen were defeated in Indiana; (Chris Chocola, John Hostettler and Mike Sodrel), giving the Democrats a majority of the delegation again.
Historically, Republicans have been strongest in the eastern and central portions of the state, as well as the suburbs of the state's major cities. Democrats have been strongest in the northwestern and southern parts of the state along with the major cities. However, outside of Indianapolis, the Chicago suburbs, and Bloomington, the state's Democrats tend to be somewhat more conservative than their counterparts in the rest of the country, especially on social issues.

List of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service

List of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service is an annotated list of the Members of the United Kingdom Parliament since 1900 having total service of less than 365 days.
"Nominal service" is the number of days elapsed between the Declaration (or deemed election) and the date of death, defeat, disqualification, resignation, etc.
"Effective service" is the number of days elapsed between taking the Oath as a Member of Parliament (if the Member did so) and the date of death, resignation, disqualification or dissolution of Parliament. In other words, this number is the maximum number of days the Member "could have sat" in Parliament, whether or not they actually did so.

Organoiridium compound

Organoiridium compounds contain iridium-carbon chemical bonds. As a third row transition metal, iridium forms very stable bonds to carbon and the organometallic chemistry is extensive.
Examples.
Iridium carbonyls.
As for rhodium, the simplest iridium carbonyl, Ir2(CO)8 is not well characterized but tetrairidium dodecacarbonyl, , is well known. which is the most common binary carbonyl of iridium. In this compound each iridium centre is bonded to the three others, forming a tetrahedral cluster. Unlike Co4(CO)12, this Ir4 cluster exclusively features terminal carbonyl ligands. Some organometallic Ir(I) compounds are notable enough to be named after their discoverers. One is Vaska's complex, , which has the unusual property of reversibly binding dioxygen molecule, O2. The anionic carbonyl [IrI2(CO)2]2- is an intermediate in the Cativa Process discussed below.
Olefin complexes.
Diene complexes of iridium are extensively developed, mainly starting from Ir2Cl2(cyclooctadiene)2. One noteworthy derivative is Crabtree's catalyst, a homogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation reactions. Iridium(I) complexes are often square planar with a total of 16 valence electrons, which accounts for their reactivity.
Cp and Cp* complexes.
Many organoiridium compounds are generated from pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium dichloride dimer. The half-sandwich complexes were central in the development of C-H activation.
Iridocene, IrCp2, remains lightly studied because of lack of applications. As with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature.
Uses.
The dominant application of organoiridium complexes is as catalysts in the Cativa process for carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid Iridium is competitive with rhodium for this large-scale application because of lower operating costs.
In the academic laboratories, iridium complexes are widely studied because its complexes promote C-H activation, but such reactions are not employed in any commercial process. Iridium complexes are highly active for hydrogenation both directly and via transfer hydrogenation. The asymmetric versions of these reactions are widely studied.
Iridium complexes such as Ir(mppy)3 have been examined in the context of phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode technology to increase the internal quantum efficiency from 25% to almost 100% by harvesting emission from triplet states.

Levasseur PL.5

__NOTOC__
The Levasseur PL.5 was a carrier-based fighter produced in France in the late 1920s. It was a conventional, single-bay sesquiplane that carried a crew of two in tandem, open cockpits. Like other Levasseur naval designs of the day, it incorporated several safety features in case of ditching at sea. Apart from small floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing, the main units of the fixed, tailskid undercarriage could be jettisoned in flight, and the underside of the fuselage was given a boat-like shape and made watertight. 
Four prototypes were evaluated by the Aéronavale in 1924, and following successful trials, an order for 20 machines was placed to equip the aircraft carrier "Béarn". These entered service in 1927.
Six examples of a trainer version with a lower-powered engine were purchased as the PL.9.
